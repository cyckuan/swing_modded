<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
held talks here today with Oman's Sultan Qaboos bin Said on Arab
issues, including the Arab summit due to be held here on June
21-23.
</P>
<P>
Sultan Qaboos, who arrived in Cairo Monday on a five-day visit
to Egypt, discussed with Mubarak means of closing Arab ranks and
the agenda of the Cairo summit, Egyptian Information Minister
Safwat el-Sherif told reporters following the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also exchanged views on the future of the
Middle East peace process in light of the latest developments in
the region, Sherif said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting between Mubarak and Sultan Qaboos was the
latest of a series of bilateral and tripartite Arab summits this
month following the victory of right-wing Likud leader Benyamin
Netanyahu in the Israeli elections late last month.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Mubarak, Syrian President Hafez al-Assad and Crown
Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia issued the call for the Cairo
summit after their two-day meeting in Damascus, Syria.
</P>
<P>
Twenty of the Arab League's 22 members will attend the summit,
making it the largest gathering of Arab leaders since the 1991
Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said Monday that Iraq and
Somalia will not attend the Cairo summit, which is aimed at
closing Arab ranks and saving the Arab-Israeli peace process.
</P>
<P>
Somalia's anarchy will prevent it from sending a representative
and Iraq, whose invasion of Kuwait in 1990 split the Arab world,
will not be invited, he said.

<HEADLINE> Israeli President Defends Military Agreement with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISTANBUL, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Israeli President Ezer Weizman
said here today that the controversial military training agreement
with Turkey would not turn to be a strategic pact.
</P>
<P>
Weizman arrived here today to attend the high-level segment of
the ongoing Second United Nations Conference on Human Settlements
(HABITAT II).
</P>
<P>
"It is a military training agreement, not a military pact,"
he told reporters after a one-hour meeting with his Turkish
counterpart Suleyman Demirel.
</P>
<P>
The training agreement, which allows unarmed Israeli warplanes
to use Turkish airspace for training purposes, has led to
strong opposition from the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question raised by Xinhua concerning the
Arab reactions, Weizman said: "If the Arab countries think that
our training agreement with Turkey will one day bring a ground
attack of Israel and Turkey on Syria, it's stupid, absolutely
stupid".
</P>
<P>
He said Turkey and Israel had agreed to carry on the
military training agreement despite the reactions from the Arab
world.
</P>
<P>
"Turkey is a sovereign country and we are a sovereign
country. We'll do what we think is right," he declared.
</P>
<P>
Weizman said he also discussed with Demirel about the peace
process and its continuation.
</P>
<P>
"I assured him that the process will continue," said the
president. "I told him that our new government must have a
chance".
</P>
<P>
Israel's right wing Likud Party Binyamin Netanyahu, who was
elected prime minister in the general elections last month, has
made a series of hard-line statements which aroused fears in Arab
countries that the peace process will face great difficulties.

<HEADLINE> Civil War Looms: ICRC Out of Bujumbura </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The International Committee of
the Red Cross (ICRC) has withdrawn from Bujumbura, capital of
Burundi, said the ICRC office here today.
</P>
<P>
The last remaining delegates of the organization left
Bujumbura on Tuesday, according to the office.
</P>
<P>
The decision to withdraw all the ICRC members in Burundi was
made following the "deliberate attack on June 4 in which three
delegates were killed," the Nairobi Regional Information Office
of ICRC said in a news release.
</P>
<P>
The ICRC's withdraw heightens the speculation that civil war
is looming in Burundi after the failure in peace talks between
Hutu Front for Democracy in Burundi (FRODEBU) and the rival Party
for Unity and National Progress (UPRONA), which started in
Mwanza, Tanzania, last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In Burundi, "the ICRC was concentrating its operations in the
medical and hygiene fields, through evacuating wounded, assisting
health centers, distributing water, restoring wells and water
pipes," the news release said.
</P>
<P>
"So far in 1996 some 250 tons of seeds were distributed to
125,000 people, while 180,000 displaced received non-food
assistance in the form of blankets and plastic sheeting," the
ICRC said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Raises Winter Wheat Forecast Slightly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 12 (Xinhua) _ The U.S. Agriculture Department
slightly lifted its forecast today for the country's winter wheat
harvest but predicted the corn crop may fall below the projections
made last month.
</P>
<P>
The department said the winter wheat crop should reach 1.37
billion bushels, based on June 1 conditions. (One bushel of wheat
is equivalent to 27.24 kilograms in the United States.) Though up
6 million bushels from last month's forecast, the harvest would
still be the lowest since 1978.
</P>
<P>
The reduction is attributed to the serious drought and insects
in the major winter wheat growing areas such as Kansas, Oklahoma
and Texas, while a cold winter and wet spring have wreaked havoc
in Illinois, Indiana and Ohio. However, favorable weather will
bring record yields in Idaho and Oregon and a good harvest in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
The winter wheat which is some 80 percent of the total wheat
output in this country is now under harvesting. Despite of bad
weather, yields in Texas, the first major state to be harvested,
were up 2 bushels from last month, reaching 24 bushels an acre.
Nationwide, the yield forecast was raised to 36.1 bushels an acre,
up 0.2 bushels from last month.
</P>
<P>
The long spell of wet weather in the eastern Corn Belt caused
the department to lower the projected corn crop to 9.1 billion
bushels, down from last month's projection of 9.4 billion, but
still 1.8 billion bushels above last year's poor crop. The record
harvest reached 10.1 billion bushels in 1994. (One bushel of corn
is some 25.42 kilograms in the country.)
</P>
<P>
The lower projected harvest also means that supplies coming
into the 1997 harvest will be 657 million bushels, the
second-lowest number since 1976.
</P>
<P>
The department raised its projection for the grain sorghum crop
to 675 million bushels, up from 640 million last month, because of
higher-than-expected plantings. Many growers have planted sorghum,
a livestock feed, on ruined wheat acres.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the department also hoisted its projection for the
soybean crop to 2.31 billion bushels, about 35 million up from
last month. (One bushel soybean is equal to some 27.216
kilograms.) The increase was due to planting shift from some corn
failure because of cold and wet weather.

PHNOM PENH, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Hotels in the Cambodian capital
have become bases for drug dealers, child traffickers and other
criminals, often protected by corrupt officials.
</P>
<P>
Phnom Penh's authorities and police are often powerless to act,
because they are stopped by high-level or ministry officials who
are bribed by the criminals, top municipal official Chea Sophara
was quoted as saying in the Cambodia Daily.
</P>
<P>
And he appealed to the government to step in to help.

The official's claims come as the government struggles to
contend with its growing reputation as a haven for foreign
criminals, the newspaper reported.

Co-Interior Minister of Cambodia Sar Kheng admitted Tuesday

ATHENS, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Polish Foreign Minister Darusz
Rosati started his two-day official visit to Greece today by
holding talks with his Greek counterpart Theodoros Pangalos.
</P>

After the talks, Pangalos described Greek-Polish relations as

On his part, Rosati confirmed the traditionally good relations
between Athens and Warsaw, noting that bilateral political and

<HEADLINE> Kazakh Government Wins Confidence Vote in Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Kazakhstan's government today won
a vote of confidence in parliament, clearing the way for Prime
Minister Akezhan Kazhegeldin to pursue his controversial pension
reform plan and avoiding a constitutional showdown with the
president.
</P>
<P>
Kazhegeldin's government won the vote by 79 to 29, ending weeks
of uncertainty and strong opposition to his proposals to raise the
state retirement age by three years and cut retirement benefits.
</P>
<P>
Deputies voted against the bill in the lower chamber on May 23,
saying any reform of the pension system should only be made when
the country has a stable economy and the standard of living has
improved.
</P>
<P>
But Kazhegeldin insists that pension reform is a prerequisite
for the government to carry out its 1996-1998 economic reform pro
gram, which has been approved by President Nursultan Nazarbayev.
</P>
<P>
At a joint session of both chambers of parliament on June 10,
Kazhegeldin demanded a vote of confidence in the government as a
last resort to solving the impasse.
</P>
<P>
Under the nation's constitution, if the government wins a vote
of confidence, it also wins approval of its bill. If the
government loses, the president either has to dissolve parliament
or dismiss the government.
</P>
<P>
But Nazarbayev had said didn't want to dissolve the
four-month-old parliament, wouldn't dismiss the government and
supported its economic reform program.
</P>
<P>
Facing a possible confrontation with the president, deputies
changed the their minds and supported the government, avoiding a
potential government crisis.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan is an oil-rich state bordering Russia with a
population of 17 million.

<HEADLINE> Election of S. Korean Parliamentary Speaker Blocked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean parliament today
failed again to select its speaker and deputy speakers because of
confrontation between the ruling and opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
The opposition, protesting at the way the ruling New Korea
Party secured its majority in parliament after the April 11
general election, said they will continue to block the selection
until the NKP apologizes to the South Korean people.
</P>
<P>
Kim Huh-nam of the opposition United Liberal Democrats, took on
the role of acting speaker in the opening session of the new
parliament on June 5, as he is the oldest lawmaker.
</P>
<P>
But during today's afternoon session, when 24 lawmakers queued
up to speak, he called a recess on health grounds and later
resigned.
</P>
<P>
His replacement, Kim Myong-noon, tried to open an evening
session, but was prevented from taking the rostrum by the
opposition.
</P>
<P>
The ruling NKP favors Kim Soo-han as speaker and Oh Se-eung as
deputy speaker. Both men were nominated by the NKP's leader
president Kim Young-sam on June 4.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties, including the National Congress for New
Politics (NCNP) and the ULD, are angered at the way the NKP, which
lost its majority after the April election, secured a majority by
recruiting independent and opposition lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
The NKP fell 11 seats short of a simple majority of 150 in the
299-seat National Assembly. But it later lured into its fold 11
lawmakers, mainly independents, giving it the majority it needed.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Consumer Prices Up by 0.3 Percent In May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Consumer prices increased
by 0.3 percent in May resulting from a continued gain in gasoline
prices, U.S. Labor Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The department reported that last month's increase in the
Consumer Price Index (CPI) represented a slight moderation
following gains of 0.4 percent in both March and April and the
fifth continued increase this year.
</P>
<P>
For the first five months of this year, consumer prices are
rising at an annual rate of 4.1 percent, sharply above the 2.5
percent increase in 1995, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Inflationary pressures this year are being led by rising energy
costs. Since starting to climb in December, gasoline prices have
now risen by 18.2 percent, including a 2.5 percent rise in pump
prices in May.
</P>
<P>
All energy prices rose 1.1 percent last month at the consumer
level, compared with a 3.2 percent spurt in April. But analysts
said that the jump in energy prices is only temporary and they are
declining at present.
</P>
<P>
Food prices were up a modest 0.1 percent in May, compared to
bigger jumps of 0.3 percent in April and 0.5 percent in March.
</P>
<P>
Excluding the volatile food and energy sectors, the so-called
core rate of inflation was up only 0.2 percent in May. For the
first five months of this year, the core inflation rate has been
rising at an annual rate of 3 percent, matching the increase for
all of 1995.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Labor Department also reported Tuesday that the
wholesale prices dropped by 0.1 percent in May.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. economy has rebounded at a rapid pace since the first
quarter of this year but the inflation has been kept under
control. How the U.S. Federal Reserve will act on the interest
rates when its policy-makers meet early next month remains to be
seen.

HONG KONG, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Hang Seng Bank, one of the major
banks in Hong Kong, today announced that it has bought premises in
Guangzhou, capital of Guangdong province, to promote its future
business expansion in south China.
</P>
<P>
An official of the bank said that the bank's acquisition in the
80-storey Sky Central Plaza in Tianhe district, which might be
China's highest building, costs over 95 million HK dollars (12.3
million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
He said that it is the bank's largest property purchase in
China.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the purchase agreement was signed
Tuesday between the bank and Kumagal SMC Development (Guangzhou)
Limited, the developer of Sky Central Plaza.
</P>
<P>
The bank's acquisition comprises gross retail space of 855
square meters on the ground floor and 1,100 square meters on the
second floor of the shopping mall, and three serviced apartments
with a total gross floor area of 347 square meters.
</P>
<P>
The 391-meter-high Sky Central Plaza comprises three
interlinked towers: the 80-story Grade A intelligent office tower
flanked by two 38-story apartment towers.  The three towers will
be linked by a 4-story shopping mall, with over 900 parking spaces
in two basement levels.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Launches Plan For Self-sufficiency in Milk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka has launched a master
plan for becoming a self-sufficient country in milk by 2003,
according to Trade Ministry sources here toady.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the plan will be implemented with the
assistance of veteran Indian agricultural scientist V. Kourian and
an agreement has been reached with the Indian National Dairy
Development Board (INDDB) to set up a milk processing plant and a
cattle feed plant in Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
The milk processing plant will cost 9.4 million US dollars and
the cattle feed plant will cost 27 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka annually imports 109 million US dollars worth of milk
powder, which will be saved if the once vibrant milk industry was
developed, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Due to the neglect of the milk industry during the past years,
milk farmers were forced to turn to alternative avenues of
business resulting in the decline in milk production.
</P>
<P>
The master plan will seek to encourage small milk farmers, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
According to the master plan, the INDDB will distribute 100,000
heads of cattle among families and establish milk collecting
centers across the country.

SHANGHAI, June 12 (Xinhua) -- China's largest commercial center
has provided a three-year insurance policy for 1,369 ancient trees
in the city.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai branch of the China Ping'an Insurance Company has
volunteered to provide insurance coverage for the trees in a move
to increase public awareness for their protection.
</P>
<P>
This is the first case of "tree insurance" ever reported in China.
</P>
<P>
At present, the city has launched an extensive campaign to protect
its ancient trees, and to urge citizens to raise funds to this end.
</P>
<P>
Sources said the city now boasts 59 types of ancient trees
which are scattered in all its 22 counties and districts.
</P>
<P>
So far, four local companies have adopted seven ancient trees,
including a gingko which is 1,210 years old.
</P>
<P>
An ancient tree protection foundation is currently being
organized to raise public funds to help cultivate the trees.
</P>
<P>
Also, the Chinese capital of Beijing has formed archival
records for its 41,848 old trees to illustrate local folk culture
and provide information that might prevent damage to these trees.

<P>
TIANJIN, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese petroleum geologists have
discovered China's first oilfield in igneous rocks, with oil
reserves of more than 10 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Discovered in 1964, Dagang Oilfield in Tianjin Municipality,
neighboring Beijing, yields 4.4 million tons of oil annually.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, oilfield workers dug several high-yield
wells in the igneous rock layer. A single well could yield 300
tons of crude oil each day, which experts believe is unusual in
China.
</P>
<P>
Chinese petroleum geologists are accustomed to searching for
oil in sedimentary rocks. Oil layers have been found in igneous
rocks in other areas before, but they could not be utilized as
oilfields because of low yields.
</P>
<P>
Two of the six wells in the igneous rock layer have begun to
yield crude oil. Oil layers more than 30 meters thick have been
found in the other four wells.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary William
Perry said today that he would recommend President Bill Clinton to
send American troops to Bosnia if NATO decided to take a new
mission in the country.
</P>
<P>
Perry made the remarks in an interview with American reporters
aboard his plane en route to Macedonia for a visit and then to a
NATO defense ministers' meeting in Brussel. His comment was the
most public one on U.S. military intervention in Bosnia after the
planned withdrawal of the present 60,000-strong NATO Peace
Implementation Force (IFOR) from the Balkan nation later this
year.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon chief said that U.S. contribution to the proposed
NATO follow-on operation could include ground troops.
</P>
<P>
If a decision is made this fall to enact a NATO-led peace
force, "it would be my recommendation that the U.S.
participate...in any force," Perry said.
</P>
<P>
He said he did not believe violence is likely to resume after
IFOR leaves, but a follow-on force could provide the war-torn
Balkan nation a type of insurance policy.
</P>
<P>
Perry said that NATO follow-on operation could take several
forms.
</P>
<P>
One possibility is for NATO to maintain the peace through air
power based at its nearby air base in Aviano, Italy, he said.
Those air assets could be supported by an elite rapid reaction
force based in a neighbouring country capable of quickly
responding to trouble on the ground.

Shankar Dayal Sharma, the local media reported.

The Gowda government's victory in the confidence motion voting

<HEADLINE> Iraq Disallows UN inspectors' Access to Sites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq
Aziz said here today that his country has obstructed
U.N. inspection in two Republican Guards sites because such an act
infringes upon Iraq's national security and sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Aziz was quoted by the official Iraqi News Agency today as
saying that he told Tuesday night Rolf Ekeus, Chairman of the
U.N. Special Commission on Disarming Iraq (UNSCOM) that the UNSCOM
should avoid provocative inspection of sites related to national
security and sovereignty, as in the case in March this year.
</P>
<P>
He asked Ekeus to concentrate on the professional and technical
work to close the Iraqi weapons program files as he said that Iraq
has furnished the UNSCOM every information and clarification it
had wanted.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said that U.N. inspectors have inspected six sites they
were permitted to enter and they have found nothing. "The
inspection team this morning continued its provocative acts and
asked permission to enter another site of the Republican Guards
inside Baghdad. We have also prevented them from doing so but
allowed them to enter into some industrial areas," he added.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the sites which the UNSCOM believed to have
evidence of illegal weapons are sites related to the national
security of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iraq's permanent representative to the U.N. in New
York has been instructed to ask for a special commission
representing permanent members of the Security Council and its
president to be delegated to Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Iraq will allow the commission regardless of the nature of its
membership, whether diplomats or experts, to enter the said sites
or any other site the UNSCOM claims to be containing documents or
prohibited materials, so that they can inspect them and see Iraq's
position is clear, he said.
</P>
<P>
He accused those inspectors from countries with hostile plans
against Iraq of carrying out possible intelligence activities in
sites pertaining to Iraq's national security in the interest of
their home countries away from the UNSCOM duties as defined by the
Security Council. Iraq has the right and legitimate reasons to bar
them from entering these sites, he said.
</P>
<P>
It is the second time that Iraq has prevented U.N. inspectors
from entering sites related to Iraq's weapons program since the
beginning of this year. During his visit in March this year
following a similar incident, UNSCOM chief Ekeus expressed his
strong dissatisfaction with Iraq's attitude, stressing that U.N.
inspectors have the right to carry out their mission in any place
at any time.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's move comes at a critical time when it is pressing
ahead with a limited quantity of oil export in return for food and
medicine for its population. Observers here deem that Iraq's
current position toward a 57-member UN inspection team in Baghdad
might have an adverse effect on its oil export under an
oil-for-food deal struck with the U.N..
</P>
<P>
The United Nations agreed last month to let Iraq sell 2 billion
U.S. dollars worth of oil over six months. Iraq has been under
U.N. sanctions since August 1990 when the country invaded Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> UNAIDS Sees Hopeful Trends in AIDS Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The number of new sufferers of the
HIV virus which causes AIDS has fallen sharply in many countries
as people practice safer sex, the United Nations said today.
</P>
<P>
However, overall HIV infections worldwide continue to expand
rapidly, with some 7,500 new sufferers recorded every day, the
U.N. program on AIDS (UNAIDS) warned.
</P>
<P>
In the United States, the number of new HIV cases has fallen 60
percent from an annual 100,000 a few years ago to 40,000.
</P>
<P>
Australia, New Zealand, northern European countries and parts
of sub-Saharan Africa have also seen the number of new cases fall
or stabilize as campaigns to encourage preventive measures appear
to be working, UNAIDS said.
</P>
<P>
Among pregnant Ugandan women attending antenatal clinics, the
incidence of HIV fell between 1989-90 and 1994-95, while Burundi
and Zaire have reported stable HIV prevalence rates.
</P>
<P>
UNAIDS attributed the trend partly to changes in behavior, such
as increased condom use, reduction in the number of sexual
partners, and later commencement of sexual activity.
</P>
<P>
But for the world as a whole, UNAIDS said, there is still
little, if any, improvement in access to appropriate care for the
overwhelming majority of people living with HIV.
</P>
<P>
About 21 million adults are currently living with HIV/AIDS, 90
percent of whom are in the developing world.
</P>
<P>
Cumulatively, nearly 1.3 million cases of AIDS had been
reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) by the end of
1995, an increase of more than 25 percent over the one million
plus cases reported by the end of 1994.
</P>
<P>
Studies show that between 75 percent and 85 percent of HIV
infections in adults worldwide have been transmitted through
unprotected sexual intercourse, with heterosexual intercourse
accounting for more than 70 percent of all adult HIV infections to
date.
</P>
<P>
Transfusion of HIV-infected blood or blood products accounts
for three to five percent of all adult HIV infections. The
sharing of HIV-infected needles by drug users accounts for five to
ten percent of the total, UNAIDS said.
</P>
<P>
UNAIDS, administrated by the WHO, has been the U.N.'s main
agency responsible for a global response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic
since January 1, 1996.

<HEADLINE> 11 Kg Heroin Seized in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Police in the Chinese capital have
seized 11 kilograms of heroin and arrested 14 suspects involved in
the cases.
</P>
<P>
The police also confiscated 130,000 yuan (about 15,662 US
dollars) worth of drug funds, police sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
Acting on reports, policemen of the Xuanwu District Public
Security Bureau discovered that Yang Zhigang and his wife Sun
Guiyun, both unemployed local residents, were engaged in drug
trafficking that extended from southwest China's Yunnan Province
to Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Following a special investigation, they captured Sun and
another suspect, Liu Zeqiang, during a drug deal May 10 in the
capital.
</P>
<P>
They also seized 30 grams of drugs from the two suspects. A
search of Yang's house produced 31 bags of heroin, 110,000 yuan,
1,670 US dollars, 2,610 Hong Kong dollars, some gold and silver
ornaments, a fire gun, three knives, five counterfeit stamps and
456 phony vehicle passes.
</P>
<P>
Confronted with this evidence, Yang confessed his partners'
whereabouts and where the drugs came from.
</P>
<P>
Local police went to Yunnan to investigate, and arrested all of
the primary suspects.
</P>
<P>
According to Chinese law, drug dealers face severe punishment,
including life imprisonment and execution.

<HEADLINE> 17 Killed In Helicopter Collision in Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- At least 17 soldiers were killed
in one of Australia's worst peacetime military accidents as two
helicopters collided outside Townsville in northern Queensland,
Australia today.
</P>
<P>
A defense spokesman said that the death toll was expected to
rise as rescuers were searching in darkness for the dead and
survivors at the collision site, about 20 kilometers from the
center of Townsville.
</P>
<P>
Each helicopter carried 10 Army's elite Special Air Service
(SAS) soldiers and a crew of four. The helicopters were taking
part in a regular anti-terrorist training when they collided 50
meters above the ground at a speed of 60-90 knots at 18:35 hours
local time. Both helicopters crashed, caught fire and burnt.
</P>
<P>
Defense spokesman Brigadier Adrian D'Hage said that rescue
operation was still underway.
</P>
<P>
He said that the injured had been rushed to a hospital in
Townsville.
</P>
<P>
He said that a full inquiry would be conducted on the cause of
the accident.
</P>
<P>
Townsville is the site of a major army base in north
Queensland, and home to the Army's frontline operational
deployment force and most of its Blackhawk helicopters.
</P>
<P>
The army base is located right in the city and the High Range
training area is at a mountain range behind the base.
</P>
<P>
SAS is the Australian Army's elite force, whose main task is
anti-terrorist operations. SAS is based at Swanbourne Barracks in
Perth in West Australia.
</P>
<P>
SAS troopers operate in patrols of six men and are trained in
free-fall parachuting, helicopter intersection and amphibious and
submarine-based operations.
</P>
<P>
The most serious military training tragedy in Australia's
modern history happened in 1964, when 82 people died in a
collision of two warships.

HARARE, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Staff at Zimbabwe Republic Police
(ZRP) general headquarters in Harare were hurriedly evacuated
following a false bomb alarm this morning.
</P>
<P>

English accent that he had paid someone 5,000 Zimbabwe Dollars
(500 US Dollars) to blow up the offices.
</P>
<P>
"We received the phone call at around 09:20 and the man said
he wanted to blow the office of the commissioner and the entire
general headquarters," said Njagu.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean farmers last year lost
cattle worth more than 1.8 million US Dollars, according to the
outgoing chairman of the Cattle Producers Association Bob Swift.
</P>
<P>
Swift said today in a statement that cattle theft is still
rampant both in the communal and commercial farming areas despite
efforts by the police and neighborhood crime units to bring the
criminals to book.
</P>
<P>
He said last year, 5,695 cattle worth 1.8 million US Dollars
were reported stolen, and only 1,991 were recovered.
</P>
<P>
"It is most unfortunate that stocktheft was so prevalent that
it damaged the overall herd. However, I am encouraged by the
positive attitude on the part of the Zimbabwe Republic Police in
taking active steps to curtail the problem.
</P>
<P>
"It is important that our police force continues to fight this
crime as its impact is traumatic and more so to the small-scale
and communal cattlemen who have had their herds ravaged by
criminals," Swift said.

<HEADLINE> EC Announces Action Plan to Improve Airline Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brussels, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC)
today announced a new strategy to improve airline safety over the
15 European Union (EU) nations.
</P>
<P>
The strategy called for more systematic methods for assessing
the safety of foreign carriers; sharing that information among EU
nations; and enforcing safety requirements.
</P>
<P>
It proposed that legislative act be taken to oblige EU member
nations to ground foreign aircraft found or suspected to be
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
It will build on existing networks and is reinforced by a
program of financial and technical assistance to enable foreign
aviation safety authorities to improve their capabilities.
</P>
<P>
The strategy also called for the future establishment of a
European Aviation Safety Authority to oversee all aspects of
aviation safety.
</P>
<P>
"Since the responsibility for overseeing air safety is divided
between the Commission, member nations, and other aviation bodies,
implementation of the strategy will be jointly shared," an EC
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
This action plan will be presented to the Council of Transport
Ministers of the EU Member States on Monday, June 17.
</P>
<P>
European air travelers already enjoy very high standards of
safety. However, the EC is anxious to ensure that the highest
possible safety standards prevail.
</P>
<P>
Europe accounts for a third of all world air traffic, but only
10 percent of accidents.

<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Chen Jinshui, 62, who is a retired
meteorological worker from Tibet and now lives at his hometown in
east China's Zhejiang Province, was for many years closer
to heaven than any man in the world.
</P>
<P>
Following his graduation from the Beijing Meteorological School
in 1956, he worked in Tibet for 33 years, 16 years of which were
spent at the Ando Meteorological Station. At 4,802 m above sea
level, it is the highest in the world.
</P>
<P>
Chen built the Ando Meteorological Station on permafrost land
in north Tibet in October, 1965, with help from another colleague
and several temporary workers.
</P>
<P>
Chen's life is full of observation data. At the Ando Station,
he made four observations and collected several hundred data
daily, which total more than 100,000 annually.
</P>
<P>
On more than 200 days a year, the weather in Ando is
characterized by gales, with the highest wind speed reaching more
than 40 mps. During 1976 and 1977, Chen Jinshui recorded several
dozen thousand data without a single error for 188 consecutive
working days.
</P>
<P>
Chen retired from Tibet last September.
</P>
<P>
The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and the south and north poles are
the "three polarities" on the earth, according to meteorological
sources. The meteorological observation data obtained from the
polarities are of extreme importance to the studies of global
weather.
</P>
<P>
The data from the Ando Station, in particular, is necessary for
medium- and long-term global weather forecasts and studies of
meteorological science.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan has made major progress
during the 1995-96 fiscal year in attracting direct foreign
investment which is expected to touch the one billion US dollar
mark.
</P>
<P>
The substantial jump in direct foreign investment in the
current fiscal year (from July 1995 to June 1996) is believed to
be the achievement yielded by pragmatic and dynamic liberal
economic policies taken by the Pakistani government.
</P>
<P>
Inflow of significant amount of foreign investment indicates
the confidence of foreign investors in the government's economic
approach and initiatives to ensure a rapid and stable economic
development.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that an improvement in macroeconomic indicators
including decline in budget deficit and inflation, stable growth
rate, tight monetary policy and control over non-development
expenditures have wooed the foreign investors to inject their
capital in different sectors of Pakistan's economy.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the opening of the economy, privatization of public
sector, removal of restrictions on the free flow of capital in and
out of the country, elimination of currency controls, complete end
to any government intervention in the working of the local
financial institutions and further improvement of infrastructure
have provided a quite encouraging and conducive climate to foreign
investors.
</P>
<P>
The latest figures issued by the Board of Investment (BOI)
showed that foreign direct investment got doubled in the first
nine months of the current fiscal year to 640 million dollars as
against the investment of 320 million dollars in the same period
of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
There are about 3,000 companies in Pakistan, out of which 669
have foreign capital. In addition to subsidiaries and joint
ventures, there are many licensing and technical support
arrangements with local entrepreneurs, some of which result from
earlier involvement in opening an industry through direct
investment, according to the BOI.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani government is committed to providing full
protection of foreign investment and for the purpose, adequate
statutory safeguards have been provided.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has now liberal, deregulated and attractive
environment for investment. The investors do not have to seek
prior approval of the government for setting up an industry in any
field, place and size, except for certain specified field.
</P>
<P>
Spurred by the spectacular rise in the foreign investment
inflow, the Pakistani government is likely to double the amount in
the next fiscal year which is just around the corner.
</P>
<P>
Geographical advantage and consistent economic policies
combined together predicts a future that ensures a five billion of
direct foreign investment beyond the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Direct inflow of foreign investment of more than 2.1 billion
dollars in the last two years outclassed, on every account, the
investment of past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believe the next fiscal year will be very
important for Pakistan vis-a-vis foreign direct investment. The
BOI has carried out more than 70 feasibility studies highlighting
investment potentials in different sectors which are likely to
witness heightened investment activities in the next fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The major feature in the next fiscal year will be the first
ever Regional Economic Summit in Pakistan which would be attended
by leaders of Central and South Asian countries as well as 500
corporate and business leaders from across the globe. This is
expected to go a long way in projecting economic potential of
Pakistan as well as opening new avenues for investment.
</P>
<P>
The developing countries registered inflow of foreign
investment estimated at 97 billion dollars in 1995, an all-time
high. Compared to that figure, Pakistan's share is limited.
However, it surely confirms Pakistan's being in the mainstay of
global economy with bright prospects in future.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai to Expand its Technology Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, China's largest city,
is launching an ambitious plan to expand its technology exports,
expecting to sell a billion US dollars worth of technology to the
world by the year of 2000, a senior government official said today.
</P>
<P>
The city is also to change the city's exporting structure of
selling merely rough goods and raw materials and replace them with
hi-tech industrial goods, the official said.
</P>
<P>
To change the emphasis of targeting sales only to Southeastern
Asia and Latin America, Shanghai is targeting the broad European
and American technology market, which have high market potentials.
</P>
<P>
Governmental departments urged manufacturers, trading
companies, researching institutes, colleges and universities in
the city to join hands to expand technology exporting some years
ago, when the city began to export technology.
</P>
<P>
As one of the most important industrial bases of China,
Shanghai has a strong presence of industrial technology,
facilities and talent, which made it possible for it to continue
to grow its export of complete equipment and assembly lines in the
past several years.
</P>
<P>
Technology exporting has expanded from simple-technology
industries such as machinery, building materials and textile to
hi-tech industries such as electronics, precision instruments and
pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey released by the city government, Shanghai
exported 244 million US dollars worth of technology overseas last
year, a 15 percent increase from the previous year.

<P>
NANJING, June 12 (Xinhua) -- A copy of "Dream of Red Mansions",
one of the few greatest Chinese classical novels, has been carved
on 800 glass pieces by a farmer in east China's Jiangsu province.
</P>
<P>
It has so far taken glass carver Si Baoliang three years to
carve most of the one million Chinese characters in the book,
using over 300 diamond engravers. The remaining one-sixth is
expected to be finished in August.
</P>
<P>
Each of the glass pieces, 30 cm. in length and 25 cm. in width,
is carved with 1,600 characters, and 240 pictures are also
scheduled to be engraved onto the glass.
</P>
<P>
In 1993 Si carved Mao Zedong's 26 poems on glass with Mao's
handwriting, to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the birth of
the former chairman of new China.
</P>
<P>
Si, at the age of 37, was awarded the title "folk artist" last
year by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural

<HEADLINE> Central Authorities to Recruit More Civil Servants through Exams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 12 (Xinhua) -- China's central authorities plan
to recruit more civil servants and other office workers through
annual public examinations this year.
</P>
<P>
The exams are scheduled for July 20, a top personnel official
said today in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The principle will continue of adhering to the selection of the
qualified, irrespective of their social status or place of
residence, said Zhang Xuezhong, vice-minister of personnel, at a
press conference today.
</P>
<P>
The State Education Commission and other four ministries and
commissions will offer 15 vacancies to those outside Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Sixty one party and government functionaries and other units
under the central authorities will take part in the recruitment
through public examination, six more than last year; and the
number to be employed will be 737, 49 percent up from 1995.
</P>
<P>
The number of employers and vacancies offered has been
unprecedented since such a public examination mechanism was
introduced three years ago, according to the vice-minister.
</P>
<P>
To demonstrate fairness, workers and farmers are eligible to
take part in the examinations as well as cadres. Those employed in
private businesses can attend the examination just as those in the
public sectors.
</P>
<P>
The vice-minister said that a pilot examiners qualification
scheme will be implemented for some departments this year to
ensure objectivity and fairness in face-to-face interviews.
</P>
<P>
Previously 22 supervisors from various walks of life have been
invited to oversee the public examinations.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that public recruitment through examinations by
party and government functionaries has been an important part of
the country's efforts to institute a civil service system, and a
major step to reform its personnel system.
</P>
<P>
It has been crucial for the authorities to select the best
talented and qualified to work for them, and for personnel
departments to wipe out malpractices and corruption, he added.
</P>
<P>
The new system has been welcomed in localities too, Zhang
said. Twelve provinces, autonomous regions and major cities have
conducted such examinations so far, the Personnel Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
According to the ministry, the examinees should meet the basic
requirements of supporting the leadership of the Communist Party
of China, loving socialism, be law abiding, well-behaved and
willing to serve the people.

Maoming's litchi is famous for its big size, thick flesh, and
fragrance. They become ripe more than 20 days earlier than litchi
growing in other parts of the country thanks to a sub-tropical
climate.

Affected by cold wave and other adverse weather conditions, the
mature period of litchi in Maoming was slightly postponed this
year. Their per unit production also decreased by 30 percent. The

<HEADLINE> Leading Vaccine Producer Tapping China Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Merck Sharp &AMP; Dohme, one of the
largest global pharmaceutical manufacturers, will soon launch a
combined vaccine against measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) in
China, as a further step into the world most populous country.
</P>
<P>
Marc Cugnon, who oversees Merck's business in the Far East,
said that the vaccine, which can produce simultaneous immunization
against the three infectious diseases, will get into China at the
25th anniversary of its invention.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 million doses of MMR has been administrated in 50
countries worldwide since the vaccine was first licensed in 1971,
and the efficacy has been proved as high as above 95 percent.
</P>
<P>
MMR will become Merck's first vaccine to be sold in China, to
break the blank sales account of the company in the potentially
huge market, according to Cugnon.
</P>
<P>
Actually, Merck transferred to China technologies of
manufacturing a vaccine against hepatitis B as early as 1989,
which the first step taken into the market. The cooperation has
helped China to build two factories -- one in Beijing and the
other in Shenzhen -- which are able to produce 40 million doses of
hepatitis B vaccine a year.
</P>
<P>
The US company also has a joint venture in east China's
Hangzhou city, which manufactures five kinds of pharmaceuticals
invented by Merck.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Merck's sales in the Far East only account for two
percent of the total 15 billion US dollars around the world. It is
a small proportion compared to the large population in the region,
said Cugnon.
</P>
<P>
Encouragingly, the sales have kept growing at 50 percent
annually since 1989 Merck set up regional headquarters in Hong
Kong, said Cugnon. Now the company has established subsidiaries in
China, Malaysia, the Republic of Korea and Singapore, and Taiwan
and Hong Kong regions. He predicted the region will boost one
third of Merck's total sales in twenty years' time.
</P>
<P>
Merck, with its headquarters in New Jersey, the United States,
has been at the forefront of developing and producing innovative
vaccines for more than 100 years.

<HEADLINE> Steady GDP Growth Forecast in HK Through 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's economy is predicted
to pull out of the cyclical slowdown to grow steadily in the
coming year.
</P>
<P>
The general domestic growth (GDP) rate is forecast to grow 4.8
percent in 1996, slightly faster than that of 4.6 percent in 1995,
according to the 1996-1997 Pacific Economic Outlook, released
today by the Pacific Economic Cooperation Council (PECC).
</P>
<P>
Looking forward into 1997, the economic recovery will continue
with a GDP growth rate expected to be 5.2 percent, said the
Outlook, which forecast 20 Pacific Rim economies.
</P>
<P>
Kwok Chuen Kwok, Hong Kong forecaster for the Outlook said that
trade, services industry, public and private investment are the
three forces that help Hong Kong to maintain sustainable growth.
</P>
<P>
Kwok, who is also chief economist for Northeast Asia of
Standard Chartered Bank, does not believe that the 1997 handover
is a major concern over Hong Kong's economy. He ruled out the
possibility of a surge of emigration as the year of 1997
approaches.
</P>
<P>
Actually, he said that the number of emigrants fell between
1992 and 1995 from 63,000 down to 43,000. On the other hand, Hong
Kong has a rapidly increasing number of immigrants and returned
migrants during the past few years, who want to seek opportunities
in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The Outlook is an annual forecast by the PECC, which comprises
government officials, business leaders and academics.
</P>
<P>
The organization, with 22 member economies, is seeking to
develop closer cooperation on trade and economic policy issues in
the Pacific region.

<HEADLINE> China Orders More Controls on CD Reproduction Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Beijing issued today an urgent
notice for further controls on China's compact disc (CD)
reproduction industry.
</P>
<P>
The notice, issued by the Propaganda Department of the Chinese
Communist Party Central Committee, together with six other
administrations and commissions, said that order on CD markets
must be restored immediately.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that over recent months some departments and
local governments have approved new CD factories without
permission from higher authorities. Their acts have violated an
April circular to downsize CD production.
</P>
<P>
These newly built factories mean money and construction efforts
have been wasted, and they have marred the market order which was
just brought in early this year.
</P>
<P>
"Their operation has helped increase crimes of copyright
piracy," the notice added.
</P>
<P>
The notice went on to say that China will not approve any new
CD factories.
</P>
<P>
According to the notice only the Press and Publications
Administration has the right to approve the establishment of new
CD factories. Additionally, overseas-funded CD factories must also
obtain permission from the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The factories already created without approval must stop
importing production lines, and halt reproduction and product
sales immediately, according to the notice.
</P>
<P>
Relevant government departments should revoke their business
licences, said the notice.
</P>
<P>
It added the government will investigate who is to blame for
illegally approving the factories.
</P>
<P>
Customs departments have also been asked to tighten controls on
CD production line imports.
</P>
<P>
The notice asked administrative departments in all provinces,
autonomous regions and major cities to launch intensive checks and
report their findings to Beijing by the end of July.
</P>
<P>
Yesterday, China announced it has punished three more companies
suspected of producing pirated CDs.

<HEADLINE> Rotating Gamma Knife, Biggest hit in SINOMED'96 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 12 (Xinhua) -- A China-made rotating gamma knife,
the first of its kind in the world, is undergoing clinical trials
on head cancer patients in China.
</P>
<P>
The new piece of sophisticated medical equipment is the most
eye-catching exhibit at SINOMED'96, an international exposition
currently taking place in Beijing..
</P>
<P>
The product, which has already obtained patents in China, the
United States and some European countries, is the only
domestically-made world-standard large medical equipment at the
show.
</P>
<P>
China is only the second country in the world to produce a
gamma knife, a revolutionary method of giving cancer patients
non-invasive treatment.
</P>
<P>
Swedish scientist Lars Leksell invented the first gamma knife
in 1960s.
</P>
<P>
A research group, headed by Shenzhen-based OUR Scientific
International INC., invented the rotating gamma knife, which can
achieve a highly advanced form of treatment, particularly for
patients with brain tumors. Its advantage is that the procedure
does not involve major brain surgery, there is no bleeding and it
is painless. It can also be used in the treatment of other, mainly
cerebral diseases, such as epilepsy and Parkinson's disease.
</P>
<P>
The rotating body of the gamma knife can deliver beams of
radiation with a precise accuracy, destroying lesions, but
avoiding harm to surrounding body tissue.
</P>
<P>
The product has passed state appraisal in China, and has been
granted a registration certificate by the State Pharmaceutical
Administration.
</P>
<P>
The annual exhibition has attracted over 400 exhibitors from 23
countries and regions, and most of the 3,000 medical products on
display are the latest developments of the 1990s, representing the
general development in world medical science and technology.

<HEADLINE> 21 Bodies Recovered from Building Debris in Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-one bodies, mostly
teenagers, have been recovered while 17 others were rescued from
the debris of a three-storey building collapsed in Pakistan this
morning.
</P>
<P>
A 55-year old three-storey building caved in with a thud at
around 5:30 a.m. (0030 GMT) in Hyderabad, an industrial city in
the southern Sindh province, according to the Associated Press of
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The residents of the area were quoted as saying that the
building was in good condition and the collapse was the result of
excavation of adjacent plot, whose owner wanted to construct a
building with deep basement compartment.
</P>
<P>
They said that about 100 people were living in the building and
many of them were close relatives.
</P>
<P>
The family of Muhammed Yousuf was the most severely suffered as
Yousuf died in the incident along with his wife, two daughters and
a son.
</P>
<P>
The neighbors said that the death toll could have been higher
if many of the residents in the ill-fated building were not
sleeping outside because of the heat and the power failure in the
area.
</P>
<P>
After receiving information about the collapse of the building,
the district administration, army officers, the police and rangers
along with the ambulances of some non-governmental organizations
immediately rushed to the spot for the rescue operation.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Beijing has seen a continuing
increase in the import of mobile telecommunications products over
the past few years, according to "People's Posts and
Telecommunications Daily".
</P>
<P>
Statistics released by Chinese customs show that the city
imported mobile telecommunications equipment worth 32.5 million US
dollars in the past year, a three-fold increment over the previous
year. The figure has already hit 13.67 million US dollars in the
first quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
Overseas-funded enterprises are the biggest buyers of imported
mobile telecom products. They imported such equipment worth 32
million US dollars last year, accounting for 98 percent of the
whole of the city. The imports volume stood at 6.51 million US
dollars in the first quarter of 1996.

<P>
In spite of a sharp decrease in two-way radio trade, the
imports of cellular phones generated a rocketing growth, hitting
98.7 percent of the whole.
</P>
<P>
European companies, especially Finland's Nokia and Ericsson of
Sweden, replaced their US and Japanese rivals to become the
leading exporters from 1995. The city spent 25.22 million US
dollars on 14,000 items of mobile telecom equipment from Europe,
which made up more than three fifth of the city's whole. The
first quarter of this year saw the market share of European
companies jump to as high as 90 percent.

<HEADLINE> US Arms Embargo Helps S. Africa, Says ARMSCOR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The United States' arms
trade ban against South Africa had opened some markets for this
country's weapons industries, leading military manufacturer
ARMSCOR General Manager Eric Esterhuyse said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
The local daily ''the Citizen'' today quoted Esterhuyse as
saying that the American embargo had resulted in most South
African arms manufacturers producing alternatives to US weapon
sub-systems.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in Pretoria on Tuesday, Esterhuyse said
the embargo on sales of US defence components had not been
entirely negative.
</P>
<P>
''This in a certain sense benefited South Africa as there are
countries in the world today looking for products coming from
outside the United States,'' he said, adding buying South African
products was attractive to countries wishing to retain an element
of independence from the US.
</P>
<P>
The US ban on arms trade with South Africa followed a 1991
indictment against ARMSCOR for violations of the US arms export
control, said the report. Negotiations between the two countries
to resolve the matter are still continuing.
</P>
<P>
The US insisted that it had to be satisfied with South
Africa's arms export control measures before bilateral arms trade
could be resumed.
</P>
<P>
However, government sources described this as a ''tricky
topic'' because South Africa's sovereignty would be at issue.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the talks said this point remained the main
obstacle in resolving the dispute between the two countries.

<P>
LAGOS, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's federal government
yesterday despatched a high-powered delegation led by Foreign
Affairs Minister Chief Tom Ikimi to Liberia to hold talks with
the faction leaders on the crisis in the country.
</P>
<P>
During the four-day working visit, Ikimi is also scheduled to
hold consultation with the Field Commander of the West African
Peacekeeping Force (ECOMOG) Hohn Inienger, according to press
reports today.
</P>
<P>
This is the first visit to Liberia by Ikimi since the recent
meeting of foreign ministers of member countries of the Economic
Community of West African States, which was held in Accra of
Ghana early last month to deliberate on ways of restoring
mornalcy to the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
According to the Foreign Affairs Ministry, the talks and
consultations the Nigerian delegation will participate in are
designed to restore the Liberian peace process following the
ceasefire currently being observed in Monrovia, capital of
Liberia, by the warring factions.
</P>
<P>
The peace process is based on the Abuja accord of last August
to which the Liberian faction leaders have reaffirmed their
commitment.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria has the largest contingent of soldiers in ECOMOG and
is undertaking its first peace initiation since the Accra
meeting.

<P>
TEHRAN, June 12 (Xinhua) -- An Iranian soldier killed four
people in a traffic accident and then shot himself dead in a
village near northeastern city of Mashhad, Khorassan province,
local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Persian daily Hamshahri said that the accident occurred
after a Toyota sedan collided with a motorcycle carring five
people. The accident claimed four lives and injured one.
</P>
<P>
The sedan was driving by Hussein Babai'e, who was serving his
military service in the law enforcement forces in the province.
</P>
<P>
Fearing that he is responsible for the four deaths, the Iranian
soldier shot himself dead, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Motorcyclists have the highest number of death rate in the
traffic related accident in Iran. Motorcyclists often do not
observe safety precautions and rarely wear safety helmets and
often violate traffic rules and regulations.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, it is not unusual to see one whole family of
four or five ride on the back of a motorcycle. Some
motorcyclists even do not have licenses.

<HEADLINE> Ghali Urges World Leaders to Confront Human </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISTANBUL, June 12 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali urged world leaders here today to demonstrate their
political will and take concrete steps to respond to
urbanization-related challenges in global partnership.
</P>
<P>
"It is time to demonstrate the vision, leadership and
political will to confront the challenges," the U.N. chief said
as he opened the high-level segment of the Second U.N. Conference
on Human Settlements (HABITAT II).
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that a global urban civilization would have a
profound impact on patterns of national and international
development and economic growth.
</P>
<P>
"These challenges are real, " he continued. "they must be
addressed sooner rather than later, in all countries. And we will
certainly stand a greater chance of success if we face these
challenges together in global partnership."
</P>
<P>
Boutros-Ghali stressed that not only the developing South but
also the industrialized north are facing the problems such as how
to improve the living conditions of the poor, how to avoid
environmental damage while developing economy, how to provide
affordable housing to the growing population.
</P>
<P>
In order to translate the decisions made at the HABITAT
II into concrete action, Boutros-Ghali emphasized three
requirements.
</P>
<P>
First, the individual constituents of the U.N. system must
engage in mutually supporting activities.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, the follow-up to this conference must be integrated
with the actions under way to implement the outcomes of other
recent global conferences.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, additional impetus must be given in the follow-up
phase to reinforcing the partnerships between the U.N. and civil
society which, he said, had made productive contributions in a
unprecedented way.
</P>
<P>
Heads of state or government from 14 countries are taking the
floor today to outline their official views on how to provide
adequate and sustainable settlements for all in an urbanizing
world.
</P>
<P>
They include presidents of Turkey, Kenya, Israel, Poland,
Romania and Albania, Vice-presidents of Tanzania and Sudan, prime
ministers of Pakistan, Afghanistan, Armenia, Guinea
Bissau. Djibouti and Burundi.
</P>
<P>
China's Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua will address the high-level
session this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The two-week "City Summit", started on June 3, had concluded
its general exchange of views on human settlements, including
strategies for their improvement, after hearing 180 statements.
</P>
<P>
The high-level segment will last three days, during which
world leaders will declare their commitment to improving
settlements and approve the final documents of the last landmark
U.N. conference in the decade.

<HEADLINE> China Narrows Gap Between East and West (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The gap between the east and west
of China is narrowing thanks to a massive injection of state
capital for key projects.
</P>
<P>
The country's worse-off western part will be given a major
boost this year after the State Planning Commission announced the
undertaking of more than 40 projects covering transport, energy
development and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Officials say this will help boost local economies and benefit
hundreds of millions of people.
</P>
<P>
Economists agreed the spending spree is an effective way of
narrowing the economic gap between the west and the east.
</P>
<P>
According to economists, Western China consists of Sichuan,
Guizhou, Yunnan, Shaanxi, Gansu and Qinghai provinces and Ningxia,
Xinjiang, Tibet, Guangxi and Inner Mongolia autonomous regions,
where 70 percent of ethnic minority people live.
</P>
<P>
The provinces and regions cover two-thirds of the country's
land, have one-fourth of the nation's population, and abound
in hydroelectric power, coal, natural gas, nonferrous metals,
mineral and oil resources.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1960s China has invested 200 billion yuan in building
more than 1,300 major industrial enterprises and 900 scientific
research institutions in the interior areas, forming a heavy
industrial base, ranging from machinery, electronics, metallurgy,
chemicals and building materials to energy development.
</P>
<P>
But historical reasons and geographical conditions have
dictated that the gap between the east and west still exist.

<HEADLINE> Rising Thefts Worry Iranian Authorities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Most Tehran newspapers today
published two telephone numbers and one fax number for citizens to
report urban thefts which have turned into a major social problem
due to economic hardship in the country.
</P>
<P>
This is part of the Interior Ministry's efforts to deal with
the rising economic crimes such as thefts, armed robberies and
embezzlement.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Ali Mohammad Besharati expressed openly
government worries regarding the increasing number of urban thefts
in the local press.
</P>
<P>
The alarm for the growing problem of thefts was raised in a
meeting of National Security Council Tuesday presided by the
minister.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that the growing trend of thefts,
particularly automobile theft and bag snatching in the Iranian
society, has been attributed to runaway inflation, rising
unemployment and increasing cost of living.
</P>
<P>
Iran boasts of 65 million population and about 90 percent of
bread-earners in the country earn less than 100 dollars. Since
most of women stay at home, men have to support four or five
member of the family with limited income. Thus, most men have to
do two or three jobs to make ends meet.
</P>
<P>
Naturally, economic hardship leads to the social problem of
theft and armed robberies. Residents have to build higher walls
and steel fence to protect them from robberies.
</P>
<P>
Foreigners, who are considered to be the richest in the
country, easily become targets of the criminal acts. They have to
raise dog at home and dare not park cars outside in the evening.
</P>
<P>
Besharati urged the armed policemen to confront the situation
with "more determination," saying "theft, irrespective of its
size, is unacceptable."
</P>
<P>
He urged the Iranian public to cooperate with the police to
insure security in the country and work on the resolution of theft
cases.

<TEXT>
<P>
There is a modern Chinese saying that an area that wants to
become rich has to build roads first.
</P>
<P>
The past decade has witnessed the government spending huge
amount of money in building a double-track railway line from
Lanzhou, capital of Gansu province, to Urumqi, capital of the
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region; an electrified railway line
running across the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region and Gansu and
Shaanxi provinces; and a railway line from Nanning, capital of
Guangxi, to Kunming, capital of Yunnan province.
</P>
<P>
A survey has shown that the Nanning-Bose section of the
Nanning-Kunming railway line, which was commission in April this
year, has shipped in and out more than 700,000 tons of minerals
and timber, and a large amount of farm and sideline produce and
industrial equipment.
</P>
<P>
"Construction of transport and telecommunications facilities
have shortened our distance to the outside world, and attracted
groups of overseas busness people," said Li Ke, commissioner of
the Bose prefecture.
</P>
<P>
The prefecture has set up 64 overseas-funded enterprises, which
used 11 million US dollars of overseas investments last year
alone, up 32 percent over the previous year, and exported 15
million US dollars worth of goods, up 38 percent.
</P>
<P>
To tap the rich hydro-electric power potentials, China is
building a package of hydroelectric power stations along the upper
and middle reaches of the Yellow River, the second longest in the
country, and in its southwestern Yunnan, Guizhou and Sichuan
provinces and the Tibet and Guangxi Zhuang autonomous regions.
</P>
<P>
At present China is speeding up the construction of large coal
mines in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, nonferrous metal
industrial bases in Gansu Province, and oil production bases in
Xinjiang, which is expected to become China's petroleum producer
in the coming century.
</P>
<P>
Economists and sociologists agreed that both the investment
conditions and the living standards of people in western China
will be greatly improved when the projects are fully operational.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Polling Goes on Peacefully in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Polling of Bangladesh's seventh
parliamentary elections went on peacefully throughout the country
this morning.
</P>
<P>
According to official reports, the polling was held in a
peaceful manner with enthusiastic voters thronging into voting
centers to exercise their franchise.
</P>
<P>
In the capital city of Dhaka, a jubilant and festive mood can
be seen prevailing the voting centers as voters cast their
ballots.
</P>
<P>
Chief Adviser to the caretaker government M. Habibur Rahman
cast his vote at the polling center in Viqvarunnissa Noon School
at 8:45 AM (0245 GMT).
</P>
<P>
He told newsmen and voters at the center that he was satisfied
with the turnout of the voters and that he hoped a free and
peaceful election would be held.
</P>
<P>
President Abdur Rahman Biswas cast his vote at another school
polling center at 10 AM (0400 GMT).
</P>
<P>
In Chittagong, the country's largest port city often troubled
by violent clashes between rival political parties, 1,342 polling
centers were set up in 15 constituencies of the district, where
long queues of voters were reportedly seen.
</P>
<P>
Local police and sources of the Election Control Room said they
did not receive any reports of untoward incidents in Chittagong.
</P>
<P>
Peaceful atmospheres were also reported in polling centers in
some other districts, including Barisal in the south, Rajshahi in
the northwest and Narayanganj near Dhaka.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, all political parties contesting the poll, especially
the rival Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and the Awami
(People's) League (AL), have pledged their full cooperation with
the authorities for a peaceful and fair election.
</P>
<P>
According to an announcement of the Election Commission, over
56.7 million voters are expected to take part in the polling to
elect 300 parliamentary seats from a total of 2,574 candidates.
</P>
<P>
More than 400,000 members of police and some other
para-military law-enforcing agencies have been deployed across the
country to maintain law and order, with 40,000 members of armed
forces assisting the civil administration.
</P>
<P>
There is an overwhelming expectation of a peaceful election in
Bangladesh today as well as an unanimous hope for all political
parties and candidates to accept the people's mandate gracefully.
</P>
<P>
However, observers here hesitated to rule out the possibility
of untoward incidents and a grim situation after the election as
they said willful acts of violence have become a routine feature
of Bangladesh's political process.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Chases Away Burundian Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania military units
patrolling the border with Burundi Tuesday chased away 280
Burundian refugees who had been arrested in two villages in
Kibondo District of Kigoma Region last Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Kigoma Regional Commissioner, Yusuf Makamba, told
reporters that the expelling of Burundian refugees is in line
with the government's decision to close its border with Burundi
so as to prevent refugees from getting into the country.
</P>
<P>
Burundian citizens have been fleeing from the going-on civil
war in their country.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations High Commission for Refugees has expressed
its concern and displeasure about this action saying it was"
brutal "since some of the expelled refugees were innocent kids.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here said that there are 500,000 Hutu
refugees from Burundi have been detained by Tanzanian military
units. The detained refugees are now facing an acute shortage of
food and water.
</P>
<P>
These refugees are unable to go back to Burundi since their
homes have already been burned down by Tutsi tribesmen in
collaboration with the army which has a majority of Tutsi
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Makamba said army units will continue to patrol the border to
prevent refugees from entering Tanzania. adding that the army
units will do so notwithstanding the stand and criticism from the
UNHCR until the government decided otherwise.
</P>
<P>
The expellng of refugees came hardly a day after the
suspension of reconciliation Burundian peace talks chaired by
the former Tanzanian President Mwalimu Julius Nyerere. Eenditem

<HEADLINE> Husseini: Excluding Jerusalem Would End Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 12 (Xinhua) -- A Senior Palestinian official
has said that if Israeli Prime Minister-elect Benjamin Netanyahu
removes the Jerusalem issue from talks with the Palestinians, it
would likely mean an end to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post today quoted Faisal Husseini, minister
without portfolio in the Palestinian National Authority, as saying
"if someone will say no negotiations on Jerusalem, I do not
believe this peace process will have any chance."
</P>
<P>
Husseini made the remarks Tuesday at a meeting in the Orient
House, PLO headquarters in east Jerusalem, with the
representatives of the consulates of France, Italy, Turkey,
Sweden, Greece, Spain, the Red Cross, the UN and the U.S..
</P>
<P>
Several of the foreign diplomats said Husseini was very
forceful about Palestinian insistence that Israel seriously enter
negotiations on the future of Jerusalem, as called for in the Oslo
accords, or face a collapse of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Husseini also warned of the ill-effects of Netanyahu going
through with the threat, which the new Israeli premier made
during his campaign for the May 29 prime ministerial election, to
close the Orient House.
</P>
<P>
"The Orient House is the center of peace in this area," he
said. "Closing the Orient House means closing the negotiations."
</P>
<P>
However, the Palestinian official said despite his concerns
over Netanyahu's plans, he is guardedly optimistic that, in the
end, the new Israeli government would move ahead with the peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
"Anyone who listened to Mr. Netanyahu the candidate must be
worried," he said, "but listening to him after he was
elected, we have heard something else, there is hope."
</P>
<P>
Husseini also met on Tuesday with Tel Aviv Mayor Ronni
Milo at Tel Aviv City Hall, as part of the Palestinian
effort to understand the intentions of the new ruling party.
</P>
<P>
Israeli media reported that Netanyahu was surprised by the
meeting between Husseini and Milo, a Likud party member,
adding that Milo did not ask Netanyahu for permission to
hold the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Four-People Township Found in Tibet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 12 (Xinhua) -- China's smallest town has been
discovered. It has a population of just four people.
</P>
<P>
The township is in southwest China's Tibet Autonomous
Region. The four-member family are the only villagers in Yumen
Township of Longyu County, a seven-square-kilometer administrative
township located at the foot of the Himalayas, according to the
People's Daily Overseas Edition.
</P>
<P>
Two of the four people are named the township leaders and the
other two are ordinary villagers. The ex-director of the township
is Qamba, father of the family, who, 71, still work as the deputy
director and becomes the oldest grass-roots official in the
country.
</P>
<P>
"Our township is situated in a remote area, but we do not feel
deserted," said Director Zhouga, elder daughter of the family.
</P>
<P>
"The local government has installed a TV set so that we know
everything about outside the world," she said, adding, "We live a
very happy life here."

<HEADLINE> Changing Girls Add Charm to Shanghai  (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is also common in Shanghai today to see girls riding mopeds
or scooters, speeding past young men riding bicycles. Girls are
also seen making phone calls with cellular phones while walking
the streets, something usually regarded as the domain of
businessmen.
</P>
<P>
By the side of some major streets, girls can be seen sitting
behind portable desks selling insurance, while on the buses you
can hear girls talk about business and stocks instead of cosmetics
and fashion clothing.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai girls have also greatly changed their way of shopping,
laying much stress on individuality. This has puzzled many
inexperienced shop assistants in the city's thousands of fashion
stores.
</P>
<P>
When they say "This coat sells very well", the girl will turn
and leave immediately. If they say "There is only one of this
coat", however, she will pay for it without the slightest
hesitation.
</P>
<P>
To seize the attention of the fashion-chasing girls, some
local major newspapers have recruited "personal image designers"
to compile special columns in the limited newspaper
columns. Personal image designing has become increasingly
popular, despite high charges.
</P>
<P>
Some people resent the way Shanghai girls have changed,
believing they have 'grown up' too quickly, but many more give
their consent and approval.
</P>
<P>
"I like the new image of girls around me, which reflects the
trend of social modernization," said a high school boy. "They have
made our city prettier."

<HEADLINE> More Farmer Businessmen Return to Farmland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Many farmer business people who
have shown their outstanding talents in running businesses have
returned to their long-parted farmland, bringing large sums of
money.
</P>
<P>
This has become a new phenomenon in east China's Zhejiang
province.
</P>
<P>
Farmer Xu Boqing, 34, from Maqiao village of the province's
Wenling city, formerly ran a umbrella factory in his home
town. His factory realizes an annual net profit of over 30,000
yuan.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, Xu learned that the government will implement
preferential policies to support grain growers, so he decided to
stop making umbrellas and contracted more than 140 mu (8.4
hectares) waste land to plant rice.
</P>
<P>
Xu sold 58,000 kilograms of rice to the state and earned a net
profit of over 50,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Local government statistics show that in Wenling city and
Xianju county, there are more than 1,000 farmers who have given up
their businesses and returned to their farmland.
</P>
<P>
Some of these former business people have become leading grain
growers, some have contracted waste land and barren hills to plant
fruit trees and timber trees, and some have contracted fish
ponds. And they are satisfied with their farming earnings.
</P>
<P>
Xu Pufa, a former director of an arts and crafts factory, said
that his eel pond can produce 1.12 million yuan in output value,
with 20 percent net profits.
</P>
<P>
High-efficient farming technologies such as soil-less crop
cultivation and mass breeding of eels have been used by the
returned farmers.

<HEADLINE> Courts in Tianjin Protect IPR </HEADLINE>

<P>
TIANJIN, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Courts in Tianjin have handled 15

(IPR) of overseas companies in the past year.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Paper: PKK Allowed to Train in Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 12 (Xinhua) -- A pro-rightwing Israeli
newspaper alleged in a report today that Syria had recently taken
the unprecedented step of allowing the Kurkish Workers Party (PKK)
to train inside Syria.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, sources in London told The Jerusalem
Post that Syria is involved in a simmering conflict-by-proxy with
Turkey, based on its concern over Turkey's control of vital water
sources and Ankara's military agreement with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Syria "uses the PKK against Turkey just as it uses Hezbollah
against Israel," they said.
</P>
<P>
In this remote-controlled campaign, the sources said, President
Hafez al-Assad exercises full control over the PKK, which has up
to eight training camps in Iran, as well as others in the
Syrian-controlled Bekaa Valley in eastern Lebanon. Now it can
carry out training activities at an area in the Gota Valley near
Damascus.
</P>
<P>
The PKK, which is said to run extensive protection rackets
among emigre Kurdish communities, particularly in Germany, is
financially self-sufficient, but relies heavily on Syria and Iran
for training and logistical support.
</P>
<P>
Today's report coincides with a visit by Israeli President
Ezer Weizman to Turkey. Arriving in Istanbul for a two-day visit
to Turkey Tuesday, Weizman launched into his mission to ensure the
continuation of the Israeli-Turkish strategic relationship, as
well as to assuage Arab opponents of the new ties.
</P>
<P>
"If they think this is a great strategic plan to attack Syria
from the north by Turkey, then this is rubbish," he said.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving Israel, Weizman met with Prime Minister-elect
Benjamin Netanyahu, who indicated that Israel's policy toward
Turkey would continue. It is apparently comfortable for Israel to
drive a wedge between the two Islamic neighbors.
</P>
<P>
In contrast to the Peres' Labor-led government, the rightwing
Likud leader has declared repeatedly that he does not have
confidence in making peace with what he called Arab "dictators,"
referring to President al-Assad of Syria, among others.

<HEADLINE> Heilongjiang to Step up Livestock Breeding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, June 12 (Xinhua) -- A top official in northeast China's
Heilongjiang Province has vowed to build the province into a major
livestock breeding center in China, by arranging production
according to market demand.
</P>
<P>
Provincial Governor Tian Fengshan said that the provincial
government will take measures to encourage animal by-product
processing factories to join hands with livestock breeding
farmers, raising more pigs and other domestic animals.
</P>
<P>
Heilongjiang has 4.6 million hectares of grasslands. Last year
livestock breeding contributed 32 percent of the province's
agricultural production value.
</P>
<P>
Tian said, "In short, we must arrange production according to
market needs and in a planned way."
</P>
<P>
"I think we should try to introduce an initiative-based system
that will link the interests of producers and processors with
those of dealers," he added.
</P>
<P>
He urged that steps should be taken to broaden Chinese and
foreign markets, encourage farmers to handle animal by-products
and step up intensive processing of such products.

<HEADLINE> Germany gives China Large Nuclear Fusion Device </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, June 12 (Xinhua) -- A world-advanced controlled
nuclear fusion experimental device has been transported to China
after being presented by Germany.
</P>
<P>
The device, known as an ASDEX unit, will be renovated and used
in research work by the Southwest Physics Research Institute of
the Nuclear Industry.
</P>
<P>
Controlled nuclear fusion research is crucial to help develop
and meet the energy demands of mankind in the future. People will
be able to use the huge energy released from controlled nuclear
fusion to generate electricity.
</P>
<P>
China started controlled nuclear fusion research in the
1950s. It built the H1-1 tokamak in 1980s and has gained a series
of physical parameters in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The ASDEX device was jointly built by Germany and the European
Community. German scientists conducted a series of experiments
with the device, making it one of the renowned pieces of research
equipment in the world.
</P>
<P>
Germany agreed to transfer the device to China after building a
larger device, realizing that China has already achieved fruitful
results in fusion research.
</P>
<P>
The device will promote China's controlled nuclear fusion
research to a new stage, experts have predicted.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Wants Christopher to Visit Israel before </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister-elect Benjamin
Netanyahu has requested U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher to visit Israel first before he goes to Washington,
Israel Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
On May 31, when Netanyahu won the Israeli elections,
U.S. President Bill Clinton and Christopher immediately invited
Netanyahu to visit Washington as soon as he forms the new
government.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu is currently holding intensive talks with the
potential coalition partners in hope to form the new government
before June 17, when the new Knesset (parliament) convenes for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
At this stage, it remains unclear whether he could put
together the coalition in time for the confidence vote in the
Knesset.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio quoted U.S. sources as saying that neither
Christopher nor U.S. Middle East peace coordinator Danis Ross
could come to Israel before Netanyahu becomes the prime minister
officially.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the date for U.S. talks with Netanyahu
was possibly set on June 24 or 25, but the White House refuses to
finalize it as long as Netanyahu has yet taken over power.
</P>
<P>
The White House and the Netanyahu's office have kept in touch
with much anticipation in Washington over the final formulation of
Netanyahu government's diplomatic platform.
</P>
<P>
Washington has pressed Netanyahu to continue the peace process
championed by the outgoing Labor government under his
predecessors Shimon Peres and the slain Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin.
</P>
<P>
The election victory by Netanyahu, the hardline Likud leader,
has sent shock waves throughout the Arab nations, prompting
urgent meetings and consultations among Arab leaders, who try to
form a united front against any change in the peace policy of the
new Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
In a move to calm the alarm in the Arab world, President
Clinton and Christopher rushed to make phone calls after
Netanyahu's win to urge the Arab leaders to refrain from making
prejudgements against the Netanyahu government.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai girls are bidding
farewell to their traditional image as timid and graceful ladies.
</P>
<P>
Instead they are becoming more aggressive in society, as
China's largest city takes a giant leap into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
With the introduction of professional soccer leagues in China
in the past two years, many girls in Shanghai have joined the
swelling ranks of soccer fans, showing as much enthusiasm as male
supporters.
</P>
<P>
Weekend home matches for Shanghai Shenhua Football Team, last
year's Division A league champions, attracted thousands of female
soccer fans, mostly young girls, to Hongkou Stadium in northwest
Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
For 90 minutes, they shouted, waved flags, and blew trumpets,
as enthusiastically as male fans. After the games many girls
gathered around the players, seeking autographs or photos of their
football heroes.
</P>
<P>
A group of students from a local girls' middle school
participated in a debate organized by local media and soccer fan
clubs to discuss the future of Chinese soccer.
</P>
<P>
On the streets of downtown Shanghai, girls in cotton T-shirts
and jeans, can be seen wearing fashionable sunglasses of various
colors, black, brown, or dark green - even though the sunlight is
not strong.
</P>
<P>
Some girls carry fashionable bags, push the
glasses onto their foreheads, and walk in a carefree way along the
busy boulevards. Usually they attract the attention of admirers or
curiosity seekers, watching or appreciating Shanghai's new
modern young women.

<HEADLINE> Hainan Strengthens Economic Cooperation With Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, June 12 (Xinhua) -- As the time for the return of
Hongkong to China approaches economic cooperation between China's
largest special economic zone of Hainan and its neighboring Hong
Kong is destined to be strengthened.
</P>
<P>
The development of Hainan could not be separated from that of
Hong Kong, and Hainan will continue to play a positive role in the
prosperity and stability of Hong Kong, said Mao Zhijun, vice
governor of Hainan, in an exclusive interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has been serving as a window for the opening of
Hainan since the island province was founded in 1988.
</P>
<P>
About 90 percent of Hainan's foreign trade was developed
through Hong Kong. In 1995, Hong Kong handled 680 million US
dollar-worth of import for Hainan and 480 million US dollar-worth
of Hainan exports, Mao said.
</P>
<P>
Hongkong investors have built 5,000 joint ventures, making up
70 percent of the total overseas-funded firms in Hainan. Their
businesses cover the fields of industry, agriculture,
infrastructures, commerce, service trade, finance, real estate and
transportation.
</P>
<P>
Notable hongkong-invested projects included the Yangpu
Development Zone, the Longwan Land Development Corporation, the
first of its kind between China and an overseas firm, Dongshui
Harbour and some key industrial projects.
</P>
<P>
Holding trade and tourism fairs in Hong Kong have become annual
events conducted by Hainan in a bid to make the outside world have
a better understanding of Hainan, and to seek overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
There are many opportunities for the two sides to enhance
cooperation in sub-tropical agriculture, petro-chemistry and
tourism, the vice governor said.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 12 (Xinhua) -- A ship belonging to the
Greenpeace organization has been ordered by Shanghai's port and
frontier offices to leave Chinese territorial waters immediately,
it was learned here today.
</P>
<P>
The ship, named "Greenpeace" and registered in the Netherlands,
illegally sailed into the mouth of the Yangtze River at noon today.
</P>
<P>
When the ship entered Chinese inland waters, Shanghai's harbor
superintendency administration told the crew through radiophone
repeatedly that the ship's intrusion into Chinese inland waters
without permission had violated Chinese laws and regulations, as
it had nothing to do with passenger shipping, cargo shipping,
tourism, business or any other normal activities, and it had never
been invited by any Chinese department, nor authorized by any
competent department of the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
The administration ordered that the ship leave Chinese inland
waters and territorial sea immediately.
</P>
<P>
At 2:00 p.m., the Shanghai harbor superintendency
administration and frontier inspection station announced a
law-enforcement order against Greenpeace, and the captain of the
ship signed a note in confirmation of receiving the order.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai harbor superintendency administration and
frontier inspection station pointed out that the captain and other
persons on board, if disobeying the order to leave Chinese
territorial waters, would be held responsible for all the
consequencies arising therefrom.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Premier Reiterates Lebanon's Right to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri reiterated Tuesday night his country's "full right to
resist the Israeli occupation with all possible means."
</P>
<P>
"Lebanon is living in the Israeli occupation and is tasting
its bitterness," he said, accusing Israel of continuing
aggression and refusing to implement U.N. Security Council
Resolution 425 which calls for an unconditional Israeli withdrawal
from southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He said the international community should understand Lebanon
and help it to implement Resolution 425 in order to end the
occupation.
</P>
<P>
Hariri's remarks came in a speech he made at a banquet in his
Beirut residence in honor of members of the Council of Middle East
Churches who were in Beirut to attend the Christian-Moslem
Congress on Jerusalem to be held in the Lebanese capital on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"You are meeting in this small state for the holy city," he
said, "the Lebanese people in the past six years have been able to
get out of the tunnel of civil war and is advancing toward the
peace and the reconstruction of their country and its political
order."
</P>
<P>
"But our peace and order is still threatened by Israel because
of its occupation of part of our lands in southern Lebanon and
Western Beqaa," Hariri added.
</P>
<P>
"What Lebanon wants is a just, comprehensive and solid
peace which is based on the principle of exchanging land for
peace and which founds a lasting stability in the region
granting the peoples a chance for rebuilding and reconstruction
and for realizing comfort and prosperity," said the Lebanese
prime minister.

NAIROBI, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Armed robbers killed two people
after they robbed a shop's businessman of 600,000 Kenya shillings
(10,000 U.S. dollars) in Nairobi on Tuesday, "Daily Nation"
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted a witnesses as saying six gangsters went
to the shop at Kamukunji area posing as customers at 10 am.
</P>
<P>
"They approached the businessman pretending they wanted to buy
some goods. Within a fraction of a second, they pulled out guns
and ordered all the employees to lie down and surrender the money
they had," a witness said.
</P>
<P>
The robbers grabbed 600,000 shillings from the safe, stuffed it
in paper bags and fled.
</P>
<P>
"The businessman soon after triggered an alarm and members of
the public rushed towards his shop and tried to intercept them,"
a witness said.
</P>
<P>
The gangsters fled after they sprayed a hail of bullets at a
man and a woman who were among the crowd that was trying to block
their way out.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Bangladesh in the Grip of Election Fever </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Tens of millions of Bangladeshi
voters rushed to polling stations today as the country's
much-awaited seventh parliamentary election is going on.
</P>
<P>
At a polling center decked with flags and posters in downtown
Dhaka, people waited in long queues to cast votes just after
voting began at 8 AM (0200 GMT). Party activists set up campaign
booths outside the center and grabbed the last chance to woo
voters.
</P>
<P>
Some international observers and polling agents of main
political parties are also present at the center in an effort to
ensure the fairness of the election.
</P>
<P>
The poll is the second in four months in this turbulent
country. After all opposition parties defied the poll on February
15, the government of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP)
stepped down to pave the way for a fresh poll under a caretaker
government.
</P>
<P>
An election official here claimed that the ongoing election may
be one of the fairest in the country.
</P>
<P>
"The renewed voters' list has eliminated a lot of fake voters
and arms recovery action has at least driven the miscreants
underground while the most important fact is that the current
government is a neutral administration," he said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 2,574 candidates, representing 81 parties, are
contesting the 300 parliamentary seats. It seems obvious that if
any party is to win with a majority vote, it will be either BNP or
the former largest opposition the Awami (People's) League (AL).
</P>
<P>
The other parties, including the rather competitive contestants
of the Jatiya Party and Jamaat-E-Islami, are expected to be
important players on the country's political arena if a coalition
government is likely to be formed.
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to vote for the AL. Since the BNP had ruled the
country for the last five years, the AL should also be given a
chance for another five years," said a teacher from Dhaka
University.
</P>
<P>
For Harun Ali, a garment workshop owner near the Mouchak
Market, his only demand is that a fair election will get rid of
the intermittent hartals (strikes) over the last two years. "I
hope the political parties should think of an alternative to
hartal," he said.
</P>
<P>
Many people are more conservative. "As it happened earlier, the
election also does not promise any better future for the people,"
said an eminent lawyer, Barrister Yusuf. He said he did not see
any ideological difference among the major parties.
</P>
<P>
Both the two major power contenders -- the BNP and the AL --
have announced that winning the poll is a "life and death"
question for them. It is widely feared that the parties might
consequently make desperate attempts, including unlawful means, to
win.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on condition of anonymity, a military official in a
canton polling center hinted that the election would be "not fair
enough" but he declined to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
The influential army, which is playing a major role in ensuring
law and order during the polls, has been charged by the AL with
being used for political ends.
</P>
<P>
According to the Election Commission, the atmosphere across the
country has by and large been quite peaceful, except in some
isolated cases.
</P>
<P>
Some 56 million voters are expected to vote at 25,953 polling
stations in this one-day election. Vote counting will start
tonight.
</P>
<P>
After casting his vote at a school polling center, Chief
Adviser Muhammad Habibur Rahman expressed his satisfaction at the
turnouts of the voters.
</P>
<P>
"The climate is favorable and we hope the free and fair
election can bring peace and stability to our country," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, a local poll-watcher warned that whatever the election
results will be, they may not be accepted by the losing parties
while the winners and losers may be locked in more battles after
the polling is over.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Planes to Begin Amman Flights on June 23 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The first Israeli commercial flight
to Jordan will land at Queen Alia International Airport on June
23, launching direct flights between Tel Aviv and Amman by an
Israeli airline.
</P>
<P>
"The first Israeli commercial flight will land in Amman on
June 23," said a travel service which will act as the general
sales agent for Israeli airlines in Jordan, according to today's
English-language daily Jordan Times.
</P>
<P>
"The first plane is expected to carry an Israeli delegation
representing both the public and private sectors," said an
official.
</P>
<P>
The airline will operate five weekly flights except for
Fridays and Saturdays as Royal Wings does.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's Royal Wings, managed by the national carrier Royal
Jordanian, launched Amman-Tel Aviv flights in March, nearly three
months after Jordan and Israel signed a transport agreement,
including an annex on civil aviation.
</P>
<P>
But the reciprocal Israeli flights were delayed after Israel
launched a massive blitz against guerrillas in southern Lebanon on
April 11.
</P>
<P>
Israel's Arkia, managed by national carrier El Al, delayed its
scheduled April 27 launch of Amman flights because of what
Israeli reports described as security reasons but what Jordanian
officials said were "technical" problems.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli reports said the opening of Arkia flights to Amman
were deferred because of fears of attacks in retaliation for the
Jewish state's military operations in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The transport agreement was part of a series of bilateral
accords called for in peace treaty signed between the two
countries in October, 1994.
</P>
<P>
Under the transport accord, buses of private companies started
plying between Jordanian and Israeli cities last Sunday. Private
cars are also allowed to cross-border travel.

<HEADLINE> China Builds New Earthquake Relief System (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 11 (Xinhua) -- China has built a new seismic
relief system, aiming at diminishing losses caused by disastrous
earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
The system is based on the integration of seismology,
engineering, economy and seismic sociology, said seismologist Chen
Yong, academician of the Engineering Academy of China.
</P>
<P>
Earthquake relief work is not only a form of scientific action,
but also one of social action, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
China is a developing country and it is not wealthy enough to
build seismatic, or 'earthquake proof' buildings of high
standards, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, China has devoted its efforts in the past years to
improving its capability to predict earthquakes, and to
strengthening relief work and reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
Chen said China has redoubled its efforts in the research of
seismic predictions since the 1966 disaster in Xingtai, North
China's Hebei Province. In 1975 Chinese scientists successfully
predicted a strong quake in Haicheng, Northeast China's Liaoning
Province.
</P>
<P>
However, a year after that, a more destructive earthquake hit
Tangshan City of Hebei Province. Hundreds of thousands of people
were killed in the disaster and most of the buildings were
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
Chinese seismologist have learned much from the Tangshan
disaster and started a new system of comprehensive seismic work,
centered on integration of accurate predictions and detailed
precautions, Chen said.

opening. "People's Daily", organ of the Party's Central Committee,
even carried a unusual lengthy article to introduce items on
display at the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
The year 1840, when the British army launched the Opium War
against the Chinese empire, was regarded as the beginning of
Chinese contemporary history.
</P>
<P>
Since then China had been a semi-colonial, semi-feudal society
and lost its 5,000-year-old glory until 1949 when the People's
Republic was founded.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition, covering a floor space of 2,000 square meters,
displays historical documents, photos, catalogues and other things
to "tell the truth that there would be no new China without the
leadership of the Communist Party", museum executives said.
</P>
<P>
The museum was among the ten "Grand Buildings" in the 1950s and
the biggest storehouse of China's revolutionary relics.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Torchbearers Take Part in Olympic Flame Relay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUFFALO, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Eleven Chinese representatives
including two donated girl students from poor families took part
in the Olympic Torch Relay here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Rang Ying, a 16-year-old Tibetan high school girl who was
chosen among 1.25 million donated students of Project Hope, was
cheered all the way by local citizens and completed her
1,000-meter leg with sweet smile.
</P>
<P>
Another Chinese girl Hu Jingjing, 15, also a Project Hope
student, was the last of the 11 Chinese in the Torch run on
Tuesday, the 46th day of the flame relay.
</P>
<P>
The Project Hope, a non-profit social welfare, is launched by
the China Youth Development Foundation in 1989. It aims to
promote elementary education in China's poor rural areas by
mobilizing social resources and support school dropouts whose
families are too poor to afford them to complete education.
</P>
<P>
"It is like a dream too good to be true for me. I am very
excited when I lit the torch. I forgot to change hands and hoped
to run five kilometers," said Rang, whose father died when she was
nine years old and lost chance to continue her schooling
afterwards.
</P>
<P>
Hu, also beamed with smile after running, said:"the Americans
are very friendly. They cheered me up all the way. I didn't feel
tired at all."
</P>
<P>
Hu came from a poverty-striken area of Shangdong Province. She
quit school when she was 10 years old, but now with the donation
of the Project Hope, she is studying in a middle school.
</P>
<P>
Other nine Chinese torchbearers including a police officer, a
doctor, and several university students, took part in the relay.
They were chosen among merely 100,000 Chinese citizens from over
20 big cities.
</P>
<P>
The Coca-Cola Company sponsored all the Chinese representatives
together with 500 international torchbearers from other countries
and regions.
</P>
<P>
The Olympic torch arrived in Los Angeles on April 27, and will
across the United States in 84 days before reaching Atlanta on
July 19.
</P>
<P>
The torch winds its way across the continent, crossing desert,
prairie and farmland, cities and small towns as it paints a
portrait of America welcoming the world for the Centennial Olympic
Games.
</P>
<P>
The 10,000 American individuals who will carry the torch
including 5,500 torchbearers nominated through Community Hero
application process and selected by local community judging panels.
</P>
<P>
The Olympic Torch will arrive at Niagara Falls early next
morning. Another Chinese Zhang Shengli will take part in the
relay.

<P>
Six months before the 7.3-magnitude earthquake in Menlian,
Southwest China's Yunnan Province on July 12, 1995, the
provincial seismic prediction center reported the time, location
and magnitude to the local governments and estimated the loss the
area would suffer.
</P>
<P>
Three days before the quake, residents were
resettled. Immediately after the shock, relief materials were sent
to the disaster area.
</P>
<P>
So far nearly 40 provinces and cities have emergency prevention
plans based on long and medium-term prediction work.
</P>
<P>
The State Council has issued a four-millionth administrative
map of earthquake intensity, said Chai Baoping, senior engineer
with the State Seismology Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Scientists have so far finished safety assessment work of more
than 2,000 major construction projects in the country on the basis
of the map, he added.
</P>
<P>
Many cities have conducted seismatic evaluations of their
buildings according to the map, and have taken effective measures
to strengthen some buildings.
</P>
<P>
In the course of establishing a socialist market economy,
earthquake insurance businesses have opened throughout the
country. They will help China to strengthen its comprehensive
prevention against earthquakes, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1990s the Chinese government has also launched
nation-wide campaigns to publicize knowledge about earthquake
relief to diminish the losses caused by earthquakes and to keep
social stability.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Liu Buxing, a farmer in the
Taihang Mountains of North China, carefully takes notes every day
on the behavior of the foul, sheep and pigs he raises.
</P>
<P>
Whenever he finds something abnormal he must report it to a
local department.
</P>
<P>
This has nothing to do with animal husbandry or new farming
methods. Liu is looking for any tell-tale signs from his flocks
that may forecast an earthquake. His findings and observations are
sent to local seismological departments.
</P>
<P>
Liu is the director of an earthquake observatory in Shigang
Village of Shexian County, Hebei Province, transmitting
information to and from four similar observers in the village.
</P>
<P>
Almost all of the domestic animals, mountain springs and wells
are taken as important indicators for compiling vital quake data.
</P>
<P>
Taihang Mountains are located in an active quake belt. In 1966,
a disastrous earthquake hit Xingtai City, near Liu's county.
</P>
<P>
Like Liu, there are more than 5,000 amateur seismic workers in
the counties of Handan Prefecture, and over 90,000 head of
domestic animals that serve as 'indicators' in the area.
</P>
<P>
So far China has set up such observatories in its major seismic
zones, providing all kinds of reference information for seismic
experts.
</P>
<P>
The typical earthquake forecasting used in the country is to
combine long-term predictions of experts with on-the-spot
observations of amateur workers.
</P>
<P>
The country now has over 400 national and 700 local seismic
observation stations, using the most advanced digitalized
recordings and satellite remote sensing technology to provide
necessary seismic information.

<TEXT>
<P>
Thanks to the joint efforts of more 16,000 professionals and
nearly one million nation-wide observatories, forming the world's
biggest seismic observation network, the time, location and
magnitude of earthquakes above 5 magnitude on the Richter scale in
the country, and above 7 in the world, can be determined during a
period of half an hour.
</P>
<P>
Predictions by integrating experts with amateurs started after
the disaster in Xingtai City 30 years ago, which killed at least
8,000 people. It was the first that occured in the densely
populated areas since the founding of New China in 1949.
</P>
<P>
Before the tragedy, pigeons were found behaving irregularly and
wells were sending up bubbles. Later those clues were successfully
used to predict aftershocks.
</P>
<P>
To understand the mysterious behavior of animals, scientists
have built more than 180 animal observatories, and undertaken
long-term research. The study shows that abnormal behavior of
almost all of the animals can serve as vital clues in early
predictions of seismic activity.
</P>
<P>
In February, 1975, Chinese scientists, for the first time,
succeeded in predicting a 7.5-magnitude earthquake in Haicheng,
Northeast China's Liaoning Province, by monitoring animal
behavior, keeping in safety over 100,000 people in the area.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years when the country has entered a new
active seismic period, they have been successful in forecasting 10
disastrous quakes at above-6 magnitude on the Richter
scale. Thanks to the accurate prediction, residents were resettled
before a strong quake of 7.3 magnitude in Menglian, Southwest
China's Yunnan Province, on July 12, 1995, and the loss was
minimized.

<P>
The Chinese central and local governments have also attached
great importance to cultivating the interests of elementary and
middle school students in earthquake prediction work.
</P>
<P>
Teachers and students all over the country have succeeded in
predicting many less disastrous earthquakes, relying on their
self-made observatory devices of terrestrial electricity and
magnetographs.
</P>
<P>
Today, under the socialist market economy, Chinese farmers have
combined the work of earthquake prediction and protection, with
their production and businesses. In Liu's county most of the
farmer seismic workers have become rich through raising foul and
domestic animals.
</P>
<P>
In Luannan County, Tangshan City of Hebei, 35 percent of the
income of local farmers comes from animal breeding and pigeon
raising, roosters and cows. They have also provided valuable data
for earthquake prediction.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen Yong, academician of the Engineering Academy
of China, earthquakes occur at underground depths of 10 to 60
kilometers. Therefore there is, so far, no direct scientific
observation that is available to scientists. In addition the
results scientists have achieved are still difficult to verify.
</P>
<P>
For the sake of the safety of people and property, Chen said,
predictions by a combination of experts and amateurs will be used
in China for a very long period.
</P>
<P>
China is one of the countries in the world to master
seismology. The effectiveness of the medium and short-term seismic
prediction has now gone up to 25 percent, the highest in the world.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen, the accuracy of strong quake prediction in
the coming years will rise to 35 percent, and that of medium and
short-term prediction in the major observation zones is expected
to go up to 40 percent.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Consumer Credit up by 6.9 Percent in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. consumer credit increased
at a slower annual rate of 6.9 percent in April while credit card
delinquencies reached the highest level in about 15 years.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Federal Reserve reported today that consumer credit
increased by 6.6 billion U.S. dollars, slower than the 9.3 billion
dollars gain in March. The advance boosted total consumer credit in
the U.S. to 1.14 trillion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Consumer credit includes all household debt not secured by real
estate. The 6.9 percent gain in April was the slowest since such
debt grew at a 6.8 percent rate in August 1993.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve said that revolving credit, which includes
credit cards, shot up at a 20.2 percent annual rate in April after
rising 15.3 percent over that of the previous month. The gain of
7.3 billion dollars pushed the total to 438.5 billion dollars
outstanding.
</P>
<P>
Many analysts maintain that consumers are becoming overburdened
by debt, which forces them to miss payments on existing loans.
</P>
<P>
The American Bankers Association (ABA) reported today that
credit card delinquencies jumped to 3.53 percent during the
January-March quarter from 3.34 percent in the final quarter of
1995.
</P>
<P>
It was the highest delinquency rate since 3.58 percent during
the fourth quarter of 1981 when the economy was in recession, the
ABA report said.
</P>
<P>
"This latest rise in credit card delinquencies is a signal that
more consumers are hitting their debt limits," said James Chessen,
the organization's chief economist.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that high consumer debt in the U.S. will result
in a slow increase of consumer spending which represents about
two-thirds of economic activities in the country.

<P>
With the monthly shortage estimated at 92,000 tons, the country
is faced with an impending shortage of cement between July and
August.
</P>
<P>
The monthly need is 150,000 tons, of which 110,000 is produced
locally by four manufacturers in normal circumstances, the sources
said.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Former President of the Bangkok
Bank of Commerce (BBC) Krirkkiat Jalichandra returned from
Malaysia and turned himself in to police here Tuesday for his
alleged involvement in a financial fraud, local newspapers
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Krirkkiat would face police interrogation on collaboration with
others to siphon off 1,657 million baht (66.3 million US dollars)
from the bank through fraudulent means.
</P>
<P>
Police have set a bail of no less than 10 million baht (about
400,000 US dollars) for Krirkkiat, but stressed that he could only
be released after interrogation.
</P>
<P>
The reports said Krirkkiat came back from Malaysia to "defend
himself."
</P>
<P>
Krirkkiat is the third in a list of six people wanted by
police, who have all surrendered to face questions about the
bank's financial affairs.
</P>
<P>
Former Executive Vice-President of the bank Ekachai
Athikomnantha has been on bail and Piset Panichsombat, manager of
Collier Jardine (Thailand), is in custody.
</P>
<P>
Krirkkiat went to Switzerland after the Central Bank of
Thailand put a control committee in charge of the debt-plagued BBC
last month. He returned to Thailand last Thursday but flew aboard
again on being warned that he faced arrest.
</P>
<P>
Krirkkiat, if convicted, may face a jail sentence up to five
years and a fine of up to 100,000 baht (4,000 US dollars).

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Fires that damaged two black
churches in Texas were deliberately set but three suspects
questioned in the case have been freed, local police officer said
today.
</P>
<P>
Harold Roseberry, assistant police chief in Greenville, Texas,
told the United Press International that they were released
"pending further investigation."

<P>
U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms had confirmed the
fires Sunday night were arson but giving no details on how
they were started, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The three men, whose car matched the description of one that
witnesses said was parked outside the New Light House of Prayer
before it was on blaze, were arrested on an unrelated traffic
offense at around 1 a.m. Monday.
</P>
<P>
Another blaze at the nearby Church of the Living God was
reported soon after the three men were arrested, causing minor
damage.
</P>
<P>
Federal officials have said the investigation on the two fires
should be given the first priority while about 30 other suspicious

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Successful in Transforming Defense Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine has made remarkable progress
in its turn-defense-industry-into-civil-production program, a
senior Ukrainian official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Supreme Soviet of Ukraine, government minister
in charge of defense matters Valery Malev said the success of the
program has also promoted the reforms in the various fields of
Ukraine's machinery sector.
</P>
<P>
According to Malev, Ukraine has spent 240 million U.S. dollars
in the past five years on this program.
</P>
<P>
At present, Ukraine's defense industry keeps more than 800
manufacturers, research and design bodies.
</P>
<P>
To make good use of this huge production force, Ukraine, since
its independence, gradually transformed the defense industry to
turn out more products for civil use instead of military purpose,
and designed military-civil dual-purpose technologies by
diversifying the operations of military enterprises.
</P>
<P>
However, Ukraine will continue to improve the quality of its
military equipments to ensure that they will meet the national
defense needs, Malev said.
</P>
<P>
Malev pointed out that implementation of the current program
has also promoted the overall national reform, and created
conditions for a balanced and complete machinery industry, with
military enterprises and research bodies at the core.

<HEADLINE> Son of Top Italian Mafia Boss Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The son of imprisoned Italian Mafia
boss Salvatore Riina was arrested in Palermo, Sicily, today and
charged with a range of organized crimes.
</P>
<P>
Mafia informers have identified 20-year-old Giovanni Riina as
an important member of the Cosa Nostra and linked him to murder.
</P>
<P>
He is being investigated for the disappearance of people
suspected to have been murdered by the Mafia but whose bodies have
not been found.
</P>
<P>
In one case, Antonino Di Caro, the 43-year-old son of a slain
mobster, was said to have been murdered by the Mafia but his body
has not been found. Mafia turncoats said Di Caro was kidnaped,
killed and his corpse dissolved in acid.
</P>
<P>
The Mafia are also suspected of murdering the 12-year-old son
of a Mafia turncoat as a warning to his father not to cooperate
with the authorities. The boy was allegedly kidnaped, held for 26
months, killed and his body dissolved in acid.
</P>
<P>
Riina's father was Italy's most wanted fugitive until his
arrest in January 1993.

<HEADLINE> EU to Take Steps Against Trading in Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The European Union here today ended
a two-day conference with a proposed program to fight the illegal
trafficking in woman that has an estimated 200,000 to 500,000
woman working in the sex trade in Western Europe.
</P>
<P>
The program includes effective witness protection for women
prepared to testify against their exploiters, and help for women
to reintegrate into their own societies.
</P>
<P>
Anita Gradin, the European commissioner who called the
gathering, said she will present a detailed plan of action to both
the EU's council of ministers and to the European parliament. The
plan would be based on recommendations from conference
participants.
</P>
<P>
"The slave trade in women is growing," said Gradin. "Women are
bought and sold like cattle. ... No part of the world seems
exempt."
</P>
<P>
"There's a general consensus that more coordinated policies are
needed at the international, European and national levels," Gradin
said.
</P>
<P>
As a first line of defense, better education is needed at all
levels, experts said.
</P>
<P>
In western Europe, authorities need to treat the women as
victims, "not just as illegals to be deported after filling out
the necessary forms," said Austrian Interior Minister Caspar Einem.
</P>
<P>
Einem proposed granting women immunity in exchange for their
testimony to break up the smuggling rings.
</P>
<P>
Participants agreed that each EU member country should create a
central unit assembling information on the illegal sex trade, then
coordinate at an international level.

<HEADLINE> General Elections Begin in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's seventh parliamentary
general elections started on schedule this morning across the
country.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview with Xinhua, an information officer in
the Election Commission confirmed that voters began casting their
ballots at 8 AM (0200 GMT) as the 26,000 polling centers opened
simultaneously in the country.
</P>
<P>
At the Banani polling center near the Xinhua office, election
officials and workers were found to be busy preparing for the
polling almost two hours before it started.
</P>
<P>
Several Bangladeshis were also seen around the center,
apparently waiting to cast a ballot before going to work.
</P>
<P>
According to an earlier announcement, some 56.7 million voters
have registered to take part in the voting, which will end at 4 PM
(1000 GMT) today.
</P>
<P>
The election is the second of its kind in about four months. On
February 15, the then government of the Bangladesh Nationalist
Party (BNP) held the sixth parliamentary elections in defiance of
the boycott by all opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
The short-lived sixth parliament and the elected BNP government
were forced to step down at the end of March to hand over power to
a non-party caretaker government led by Chief Adviser M. Habibur
Rahman, which arranged the new elections.
</P>
<P>
To ensure a peaceful, free and fair atmosphere for the
elections, 4oo,000 members of police and other para-military
forces as well as 40,000 members of the armed forces have been
deployed to maintain law and order throughout the country.

<HEADLINE> Defiant Chechen Government to Hold Polls Earlier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Chechen head of state Doku
Zavgayev, defying a hard-won accord signed Sunday by Moscow and
Chechen rebels, said today that the June 16 parliamentary polls in
Chechnya will be held two days ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
Zavgayev, who heads the pro-Moscow Chechen government, said the
decision to advance the polling date was made by the republic's
Central Electoral Commission "in view of the current complicated
situation" in the war-torn region.
</P>
<P>
The decision, which also prolongs the planned one-day voting to
two days, was applied as well to the June 16 Russian presidential
election which will also be advanced by two days in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
The decision is seen as a countermeasure to the accord reached
Sunday between Moscow and Chechen separatists which postpones the
parliamentary election until after a complete withdrawal of
Russian troops from Chechnya and disarmament of the rebels by the
end of August.
</P>
<P>
The accord was strongly opposed by Zavgayev, who told Interfax
news agency that he would only observe a peace agreement reached
late last month between Russian President Boris Yeltsin and
separatist leader Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev.
</P>
<P>
That agreement only sets broad principles on ending the
fighting in the breakaway republic and does not touch on the
contentious Chechen election.
</P>
<P>
The details of the agreement are under discussion between the
two sides and Sunday's accord was the first encouraging result
after two rounds of tough talks.
</P>
<P>
The Russian delegation had initially refused to discuss the
election, insisting that it is Chechnya's internal matter, but
later gave way after the rebels gave up their demand for a
cancellation of the vote.
</P>
<P>
Russian leaders have refrained from stepping into the row over
the Chechen election. Prime Minister Viktor Chernormyrdin said
today a solution to the dispute is up to the Chechens themselves.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Industrial Projects to Enjoy Early Tax Break </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Industrial projects with the
participation of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN) may start to enjoy tax privileges next month, earlier than
non-ASEAN projects, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Tax privileges for ASEAN projects do not have to wait until
2003 when the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) tariff reduction scheme
comes into force, said the reports.
</P>
<P>
The privileges were granted under the ASEAN Industrial
Cooperation Scheme (AICS) and the timetable was set after ASEAN
trader ministers signed an accord last April granting ASEAN
manufacturing projects tariff cuts to zero-five percent.
</P>
<P>
Other non-tariff privileges will be determined by each
individual government.
</P>
<P>
The AICS will also allow joint ventures involving non-ASEAN
countries to take advantage of the scheme, provided that the
ventures include at least 30 percent national equity, or local
ownership.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN currently groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> A Green Pearl of Tibet (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Early this year, Gongbo'gyamda County, one of the seven
counties in the Nyingchi Prefecture, became the first of the 18
poverty-stricken counties in Tibet to shake off poverty, turning
Nyingchi into the only prefecture without poor-income areas.
</P>
<P>
Fast economic growth has brought about the development of
education: by the end of 1995, 10 middle schools and 324 primary
schools had been established throughout the prefecture, with a
total of 28,000 students.
</P>
<P>
In the Nyingchi County, 95 percent of adults between 15 and 45
have overcome illiteracy.
</P>
<P>
A local official attributed all these achievements to the hard
and persistent work of the Nyingchi people, as well as unselfish
assistance from all over the country.
</P>
<P>
In the past decade, he said, 604 projects with investments of
270 million yuan were completed. Of the 62 state-financed projects
in Tibet, 10 were located in Nyingchi and are already completed.
</P>
<P>
The state also invested 40 million yuan to build a road to
Medog County, which used to be the only county in the country
without any roads, he said.
</P>
<P>
To celebrate the prefecture's tenth anniversary earlier,
officials there launched 12 urban renewal projects, which were
funded with 33 million yuan from Guangdong and Fujian, two coastal
provinces in southern China.
</P>
<P>
"The Bayi Township, where the prefecture government is located,
has grown from a small riverside village into a modern city," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the state is planning further investment to
upgrade the roads leading to Nyingchi, and to bury fiber-optics
cables between Lhasa, the capital of the autonomous region, and
the Bayi township.
</P>
<P>
"Nyingchi people are quite confident to achieve economic
prosperity at the end of this century, and to build their hometown
into a splendid pearl on the Tibetan Plateau," he claimed.

<HEADLINE> Onshore Oil Production Rises Slightly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 12 (Xinhua) -- China's onshore oil fields yielded
58.9 million tons of crude oil in the first five months of this
year, 1.9 per cent more than in the same period last year, it was
reported here today.
</P>
<P>
Total production, including 5.4 million tons by offshore oil
fields, stood at 64.3 million tons, the English language newspaper
China Daily quoted the China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) as
saying yesterday.
</P>
<P>
CNPC plans to produce 139 million tons of crude for the whole
year. Last year, its 21 oilfields produced 140.7 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC), with several
major oilfields put into production, will increase output to 13
million tons this year from last year's 8.7 million tons.
</P>
<P>
CNPC executives at a recent conference said they expect
State-set production targets will be met.
</P>
<P>
Daqing, China's largest oilfield, pumped out 23.3 million tons
between January and May, 0.4 percent more than in the same period
last year. Its State-set target for this year is 55.4 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The second largest oilfield, Shengli, produced 12.2 million
tons, down 1.4 percent. It plans to pump out 28.5 million tons
this year.
</P>
<P>
Liaohe, the third largest, pumped out 6.3 million tons, down
1.9 percent. It should produce 15 million tons this year.
</P>
<P>
It is becoming more difficult for older oil fields in the
eastern part of the country to keep production from declining, as
underground waters flood due to decades of exploitation.
</P>
<P>
Major discoveries are to come yet in exploration in teh western
part of the country, especially Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The Xinjiang Oilfield pumped out 3.4 million tons in teh first
five months, up 2.4 percent from the same period last year. Total
production this year will be 8 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Production in the Tarim Basin, which is expected to grow into
China's major oil production base in the next century, was 1.3
million tons, up 22 percent.
</P>
<P>
Geologists estimate that more than 10 billion tons of crude oil
may be contained in the basin. To accelerate exploration in the
basin, which is mainly covered by the Taklimakan Desert, China has
allowed overseas oil firms to conduct oil operations there.
</P>
<P>
Now several major foreign companies, including US oil giants
Exxon and Texaco, Italy's Agip, French company Elf and Japanese
Sumitomo Corp, are exploring for oil and gas there.
</P>
<P>
The highest growth among oilfields in the western part was
created by the Turpan-Hami Oilfield, which pumped out 1.2 million
tons in these five months, up 55 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Changqing Oilfield in Shaanxi Province chalked up a growth
of 20 percent by pumping out 1.1 million tons. This year, it will
produce 2.6 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The Zhongyuan Oilfield in Henan Province, central China, pumped
out 1.6 million tons, 6 percent less than in the January-May
period last year, while the Jilin Oilfield produced 1.5 million
tons, up 11 percent.

<HEADLINE> Solve Mercosur Internal Controversies: Uruguayan President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The South American Common
Market (Mercosur) needs regional bodies to solve controversies
within the organization, said Uruguayan President Julio Maria
Sanguinetti today in Asuncion, the capital of Paraguay.
</P>
<P>
"We are simply acting through government bodies and we do not
have the justice courts nor the trade bodies capable of settling
the diverse disputes of the regional sphere," Sanguinetti pointed
out before the Paraguayan congress who is currently on a 48-hour
official visit.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of regional bodies will help find solutions
to controversies and enable Mercosur members, Argentina, Brazil,
Paraguay and Uruguay, to take paths towards further integration,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Sanguinetti added that regional integration has helped promote
trade within the Mercosur, which went up from four billion
U.S. dollars to 12 billion in the past five years. Meanwhile,
Mercosur's trade with outside countries also increased from 60 to
80 billion U.S. dollars in the same period.
</P>
<P>
The Mercosur, formerly the Southern Cone Common Market, was
founded in 1995 by the four Latin American countries, for
promoting regional trade and economy.

<HEADLINE> Sino-Japanese Lysine Venture Starts Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, June 12 (Xinhua) -- A Sino-Japanese joint venture for
producing 6,000 tons of lysine a year recently went into operation
in Chengdu, the capital of southwest China's Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
Operation of the production line, the largest of its kind in
China, will help cut down China's import of lysine from other
countries and boost its development of cultivation and fodder
industries.
</P>
<P>
Lysine is a crystalline basic amino acid that is essential to
the healthy nutrition of human beings and animals. It is in great
demand in both Chinese and overseas markets, as it provides an
indispensable additive to fodder products.
</P>
<P>
Ajinomoto Co Inc., the leading lysine producer in the world,
has branches in France, Thailand and the United States. Its
combined annual output of lysine totals 105,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
China is appealing to Ajinomoto to join in its capacity as a
worldwide agricultural and animal husbandry giant, an Ajinomoto
official said.

<HEADLINE> Reservoir Used for Fish Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, June 12 (Xinhua) -- China has succeeded in increasing
its aquatic output by raising fish in reservoirs.
</P>
<P>
The country caught 815,000 tons of freshwater fish from
reservoirs last year, accounting for 12 percent of the national
output.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that China has 86,000 reservoirs which cover
2 million ha. of water surface, making up 40 percent of China's
inland water surface.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995, 70 percent of reservoirs in China were used
for fish raising, which yielded 4 billion yuan in output value.
</P>
<P>
The Danjiangkou reservoir leads the country in raising the per
ha. fish yield to 1.95 million tons by fishing in netted case.
</P>
<P>
A number of reservoirs began to raise whitebait since central
China's Henan Province introduced the valuable species in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Agriculture plans to make full use of the
country's 30 percent untapped water surface and increase its
aquatic output to 28.5 million tons by the year 2000.

Austria's economic problems to be tackled by a different person
with new ideas.
</P>
<P>
Ditz, a member of the ruling Peoples Party (PP), became
economics minister in May 1995.
</P>
<P>
He was state secretary of finance from 1994 to 1995 and had
hoped to be appointed finance minister after the general elections
in December 1995. But he did not get what he wanted from the
coalition government formed by the Social Democratic Party (SDP)
and the PP.
</P>
<P>
Both Chancellor Franz Vranitzky who heads the SDP and Vice
Chancellor Wolfgang Schuessel who chairs the PP said they were
sorry that Ditz had resigned and praised his role in drawing up
the austerity plan.
</P>
<P>
Vranitzky said a new Economics Minister would be selected from
the PP.

<P>
WASHINGTON, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Rick Demont, who was stripped
of a gold medal after a positive drug test at the 1972 Olympic
Games, is going to court and blaming U.S. Olympic officials.
</P>
<P>
DeMont, who tested positive for taking a banned stimulant, has
filed suit in U.S. District Court claiming the U.S. Olympic
Committee mishandled his medical disclosure form to the
International Olympic Committee (IOC).
</P>
<P>
He was using the asthma medications Marax and Actifed, which
included the banned stimulant ephedrine.
</P>
<P>
The IOC has twice rejected DeMont's petitions to return the
gold medal he won in the 400-meter freestyle, most recently in
March. DeMont seeks unspecified damage, but there is little doubt
he is going for the gold.

WASHINGTON, June 11 (Xinhua) -- US Olympic rower Amy Lynn
Fuller, who missed a court date last week, is facing a arrest
warrant in the state of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
The 1993 Rower of the Year and her attorney missed a court date
here last week to answer charges she was driving while intoxicated
and without proof of auto insurance. So a bench warrant was issued
for her arrest.
</P>
<P>
If the California woman is stopped anywhere in the state, she
will be detained for prosecution.
</P>
<P>
Fuller, 27, faces up to one year in jail and more than 1,200
dollars in fines plus driving school and a week of community
service. She was charged April 15 after being stopped by police.
</P>
<P>
Fuller's attorney, Steve Gilliam, said the missed court date
was simply a misunderstanding. He said he thought the case had
been rescheduled for August 19 and Fuller was in Switzerland
competing in a regatta.

<HEADLINE> A Green Pearl of Tibet (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Green is the color of Nyingchi, one
of the seven prefectures in southwest China's Tibet Autonomous
Region.
</P>
<P>
Nearly half of its land is covered with trees, accounting for
80 percent of the autonomous region's forested areas.
</P>
<P>
It is the only place in Tibet with suitable natural conditions
to grow rice and fruits such as apples and peaches, just as the
people in South China do.
</P>
<P>
With an average elevation of 3,100 meters and the Yarlung
Zangbo River flowing through, various climates co-exist here, from
tropical to frigid.
</P>
<P>
Precious medicinal herbs can be found in the forests, such as
caterpillar fungi and fritillary bulbs, as well as rare wild
animals, such as tigers, leopards, bears, and antelopes.
</P>
<P>
Compared to the harsh environment in other parts of Tibet,
Nyingchi is like an oasis in the desert, full of heavenly beauty
and peace.
</P>
<P>
But even with the best natural conditions in the region, it was
the last prefecture in Tibet to see an economic takeoff.
</P>
<P>
It was officially approved as a prefecture only ten years ago.
However, within a short period of time, Nyingchi has already set a
number of records in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to nine years of consecutive good harvests, the average
food intake for Nyingchi people has reached 600 kg, making the
prefecture the first in Tibet to achieve self-sufficiency with
regard to food.
</P>
<P>
Nyingchi citizens eat more pork than any other Tibetans. They
also claim one pig per person, and have more savings than their
fellow countrymen. The average annual income in the autonomous
region tops 1,154 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Nyingchi has established itself as the second largest
industrial base in Tibet; its regional gross national product
tripled from 6.61 million yuan in 1986 to 280 million yuan in
1995, 25 percent of which came from the township industry and
service sector.

<HEADLINE> NZ Trade Terms Worsen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, June 12 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand's terms of trade
dropped by 1.4 percent in the March 1996 quarter and are now 2.3
percent lower than in March last year, Statistics NZ said today.
</P>
<P>
The fall in the latest quarter was caused by a 1.2 percent
decrease in export prices and a 0.2 percent rise in import prices,
deputy statistician Ian Ewing noted.
</P>
<P>
"This fall means that returns from a fixed quantity of exports
would have purchased 1.4 percent less in volume of imports in the
March 1996 quarter than in the December 1995 quarter," he said.
</P>
<P>
Export prices are now 3.2 percent lower than for the March 1995
quarter.
</P>
<P>
Among prices to fall during the March 1996 quarter were
forestry, by 5 percent, after strengthening for the past six
quarters, and meat, by 4 percent, its lowest level since the
December 1988 quarter. Aluminum, machinery, transport equipment
and fish prices also fell.
</P>
<P>
Key import price rises were in petroleum products, electrical
machinery, transport equipment, clothing and footwear and non-fuel
crude materials.

<HEADLINE> Mall Blast Kills 44, Injures 200 in Brazil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- At least 44 people were killed
and more than 200 injured at lunchtime Tuesday in an explosion
in a Sao Paulo shopping mall, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
The blast occurred just after noon (1500 GMT) at the
Osasco Shopping Plaza in an industrial suburb about 16 kilometers
west of Sao Paulo, the country's biggest city.
</P>
<P>
The explosion tore through the crowded mall and collapsed two
floors of a restaurant section, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-seven bodies were discovered in the rubble and 17 others
died at or en route to hospital, according to the reports.
</P>
<P>
The fire department and the civil defense department said it
was too early to tell what caused the explosion, but firefighters
at the rescue site said it was probably a gas leak in pipes
beneath the restaurant floor.
</P>
<P>
The one-year-old mall, which has 200 stores, three movie
theaters and 20,000 square meters of floor space, receives an
average of 40,000-50,000 shoppers a day.
</P>
<P>
It was packed with teenage shoppers ahead of Wednesday's Lovers
Day, Brazil's equivalent of Valentine's Day, when Brazilian
couples traditionally exchange gifts.

<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, Cameroon, June 11 (AFP) - A top athletics official
criticised here on Tuesday the continent's track and field stars
who missed the African Championships.
</P>
<P>
Colonel Kalkaba Malboum, the president of the Cameroon Athletic
Federation hosting the five-day event which begins on Wednesday,
said: "It's disappointing not just for me but for African
athletics.
</P>
<P>
"We face difficulties with lack of money and lack of equipment
but we still stage the championships ... but the big names don't
come to help or inspire the young who regard them as models.
</P>
<P>
"They should contribute. They became famous because we helped
to promote them. Saying they are staying away to prepare for the
Olympics is just an excuse."
</P>
<P>
World champions like Haile Gebreselassie, Noureddine Morceli
and Moses Kiptanui are not expected to compete here, although
Malboum said he did not have up-to-date lists of which countries
or athletes would be at the opening ceremony on
Wednesday. Officially, 38 countries and 530 athletes are down to
compete.

<HEADLINE> China Produces New Handy High-Voltage Meter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 11 (Xinhua) -- A demonstration of a new handy
high voltmeter from China that can measure up to 35,000 volts,
both AC and DC, aroused great interest among American experts from
both power and instrumentation industries.
</P>
<P>
The demonstration, arranged by the China-America Technology
Corp. (CTC), was carried out Monday at the Electric Power Research
Institute's Laboratory in New York.
</P>
<P>
The beauty of the voltmeter, which was developed by the Chinese
Academy of Sciences, is that it enables maintenance workers to
find out faults on high-voltage lines without the need to shut
down electricity.
</P>
<P>
It was made possible by a smart combination of electronics with
insulation materials and new technology in electricity, according
to a spokesman for CTC.
</P>
<P>
The meter gives digital readouts on the voltage, as well as
phase comparators that are vital to the safe operation of
generators and transformers.
</P>
<P>
"This invention can result in tremendous savings in time and
money for electric power companies in their maintenance of
transmission lines and improved customer service," said Professor
Ngee-Pong Chang of City College's Physics Department, who heads
CTC.
</P>
<P>
The product is only one of many items to be published in CTC's
new edition of ChinaTech Listing.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Academy of Sciences, with 123 institutes, produces
more than 1,000 inventions annually. Some 200 top inventions per
year are selected for the exclusive ChinaTech Listing.
</P>
<P>
The China-America Technology Corp. was founded last year to
serve as a two-way bridge for technology transfer between the U.S.
and China, Chang said. It is also the outgrowth of a 15 year
relationship between City College and the Chinese Academy of
Sciences and a number of established universities in China, he
added.

<HEADLINE> Italy Defeats Russia 2-1 in Euro Soccer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Italy, the runner-up of the U.S.
World Cup final in 1994, swept to a convincing victory over its
strong opponet Russia 2-1 in a group C match of the European
Soccer Chammpionship held this afternoon at the Anfield Stadium in
the football city Liverpool.
</P>
<P>
Italian striker Pierluigi Casiraghi, in superb form, grapsed a
fleeting opportunity at the 5th minute by firing home a 25-meter
shot and the action was so quick that the Russian goalkeeper was
left making no reactions.
</P>
<P>
However, the early loss of a goal did not affect the high
fighting spirits of the Russian team, which launched waves of
counterattacks and finally found a equalizer 15 minutes later by
Ilia Tsymbalar.
</P>
<P>
At the start of the second half, the Italian team brought in
experienced player Roberto Donanoni and obtained a clear upper
hand in the game. At the 52th minute, Casiraghi received a clever
pass from Gianfranco Zola and scored the crucial winning goal.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after the match, Casiraghi, the hero of the match,
said," it is the best moment of my carrer. The first game is
always very difficult, but to come here and score two goals in
such a stadium is great."
</P>
<P>
"It is quite an emotion to play on a pitch like Anfield and I
watched Liverpool as a young boy and to come here and see the
writing 'you will never walk alone' was very emotional for me," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Italian coach Arrigo Sacchi hailed his troops
victory over the Russian side, saying "the second half was one of
the best Italian performances of recent times."
</P>
<P>
"If we had carried on playing like we did in the first half we
would have lost. I am very relieved." Sacchi said.
</P>
<P>
Russian striker Andrei Kanchelskis, who played in a England
football club, said," I don't think anything catastrosphic
happened. All is not lost. We are in a difficult position but we
will fight."
</P>
<P>
In a group D match between Croatia and Turkey this evening,
Croatia, which is taken as a dark horse in the Euro '96
tournament, failed to live up to their big pre-tournament billing
and make most people feel disappointed.
</P>
<P>
However, Turkey, commonly regarded as an underdog of the
Championship, took early control of the match and forced their
more fancied opponents on the defensive.
</P>
<P>
Croatian international stars Zvonimir Boban and Robert
Prosineki made many neat touches in the game but failed to make
inroads upfront. As the match continues, the Croatians became
more and more frustrated and failed to gained a clear advantage.
</P>
<P>
Four minutes before the final whistle, Croatia's Goran Vlaovic
got a pass and raced clear from the half-way line to slot home the
crucial goal for Croatia.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Four people were killed while 11
others were injured when a bomb went off on a car of a metro train
in the south of the capital late today.
</P>
<P>
Three died on the blast scene while the fourth died in hospital.
</P>
<P>
The victims suffered severe burns after the explosive device,
thought to have been concealed under a seat, rocked the train with
an equivalent force of 500 grams of TNT.
</P>
<P>
The Itar-Tass News Agency reported that the train was
travelling in between two stations when the blast went off.
</P>
<P>
Some 250 commuters were travelling on the train travelling from
the Tulskaya station to Nagakinskaya.
</P>
<P>
Tulskaya is about five kilometers south of the Kremlin and is
located in a residential part of the capital city.
</P>
<P>
Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov and Russian Minister of Emergency
Situation Sergi Shoigu hurried to the scene to coordinate rescue
work.
</P>
<P>
It was the second bomb blast in the city prior to the Russian
presidential elections slated for the coming Sunday. A bomb blast
that went off last Friday seriously injured Valery Shantsev,
running mate of Luzhkov in the mayoral poll.
</P>
<P>
The mayor said that this was the first terrorist attack against
the general public in Moscow's underground since it opened in the
1930s.

<P>
PARIS, June 11 (Xinhua) -- San Marino is risking to be expelled
from World Formula 1 Championships when hundreds of "Tifosi" --
Italian Ferrari fans -- poured onto the track after world champion
Michael Schumacher finished second in his Ferrari behind Damon
Hill in a Williams-Renault on May 5.
</P>
<P>
The International Automobile Federation (FIA), the formula-one
grand prix governing body, were upset by the accident, fining
organizers of Italy's San Marino race but stopping short of
expelling them from the championship here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
At the time of the crowd invasion, drivers were still finishing
the race, held on May 5.
</P>
<P>
FIA officials indicated that San Marino would remain on the
grand prix calendar if organizers provided a complete plan on how
to avoid such incedents in the future.
</P>
<P>
The Italians were fined one million dollars, 750,000 dollars of
which does not have to be paid unless there is a repeat of the
1996 crowd problems next year.
</P>
<P>
The FIA decided that if spectators endanger themselves or the
race drivers, the safety car would be brought onto the track until
the problem was resolved.

<HEADLINE> UN Council Considers Reaction Against Iraq on Inspection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
is considering reaction against Iraq's denial of U.N. access to a
Republican Guard facility for a weapon-related inspection, Council
President Nabil A. Elaraby said today.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks after the council was briefed on the access
denial by Rolf Ekeus, chief of the U.N. Special Commission in
charge of destroying Iraq's nuclear, biological and chemical
weapons.
</P>
<P>
"The council expresses deep concern about any obstruction in
the discharge of the Special Commission's work and
responsibilities that was made clear by everyone," said Elaraby.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council members also express full support to the
Special Commission, to Ambassador Ekeus and his team and they are
considering appropriate reaction to demonstrate the full resolve
of the council to ensure that the Security Council resolutions
regarding access are respected and observed," he said.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats said that the United States and Britain had put
forward a draft resolution on the issue and that the council will
discuss it Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The standoff between Iraq and the U.N. inspection team was
reported to be at Abu Ghuraib, which is in a suburb of Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
The inspectors were withdrawn because of darkness and the fact
that the U.N. team had no helicopter to enable them to spot
whether any materials were being removed from the sites.

<HEADLINE> US Government Notifies Congress on Jordan F-16s </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government has
informed the Republican-controlled Congress that it intends to
supply F-16 war fighters to Jordan, U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher said today.
</P>
<P>
Christopher made the disclosure before a lunch with visiting
King Hussein of Jordan.
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad to say in the presence of the King that we have sent
the notification with respect to the F-16s to Capitol Hill,"
Christopher told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"That's a very important step in the process, and we intend to
proceed with that in the customary way," the U.S. secretary of
state added.
</P>
<P>
The agreement to supply Jordan F-16 war planes was reportedly
reached early this year. U.S. officials have made clear that the
move is linked with Jordan's decision to sign a peace treaty with
Israel in 1994.
</P>
<P>
"We think that those F-16s are an important aspect of the
security of Jordan, and they're really a reflection of what
President Clinton has said so many times...and that is for those
who have taken the risks for peace," Christopher said.

<HEADLINE> UK Consumer Spending Continues to Accelerate in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Consumer spending in Britain rose
by 6.2 percent in May compared with the corresponding time last
year and the increase was the second biggest on record, according
to the latest survey carried out by the British Retail Consortium.
</P>
<P>
The average growth rate over the last three months was 4.1
percent, and the May level was only bettered by the 7.5 percent
growth in March when an early Easter gave the figures an
artificial boost.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, furniture and carpet sales continued
on an upward trend thanks to the improving housing market.
</P>
<P>
Consumers are benefiting from a combination of subdued
inflation, rising incomes, the cheapest borrowing rates for 30
years and lower taxes.
</P>
<P>
"Despite being one of the coldest months of May on record,
retail sales maintained their recent encouraging growth and appear
to be benefiting from some increase in consumer confidence," said
the consortium's economic affairs committee chairman, Andrew
Higginson, who welcomed last week's interest rate cut as "a
further step in the right direction."

<HEADLINE> Low Input Costs Prompt UK Manufacturers to Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The cost of fuel and raw materials
to British industry fell sharply last month, prompting
manufacturers to cut their prices for the first time in almost
four years.
</P>
<P>
According to figures published by the Office for National
Statistics, industry's input prices fell by 0.5 percent in May.
The annual rate of input price inflation declined from 2.2 percent
to 1.1 percent, a level last seen two years ago.
</P>
<P>
Excluding the food, drink, tobacco and petroleum industries,
raw material costs fell by a seasonally adjusted 0.3 percent in
May. This was the eighth successive monthly decline, the longest
continuous run of falling costs since the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
With raw material costs declining and unsold goods piling up
manufacturers cut their prices by 0.1 percent in May, the first
monthly decline since August 1992.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the annual rate of output price growth fell to 2.9
percent in May, from 3.2 percent in April, the lowest rate of
increase since December 1994.
</P>
<P>
Core output prices, excluding volatile changes in food, drink,
tobacco and petroleum, rose by only 0.1 percent in May. Its
year-on-year rate fell to 2.4 percent from 2.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The unexpectedly subdued costs came as welcome news to Kenneth
Clarke, the chancellor of the Exchequer, who last week justified
his controversial quarter-point cut in UK interest rates by
pointing to an easing of cost pressures.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Proposes New Mission to Haiti </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 11 (Xinhua) -- As the U.N. Mission in
Haiti draws to an end on June 30, 1996, U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali today recommended the establishment of a new
mission to be known as the U.N. Support Mission in Haiti.
</P>
<P>
In a report to the Security Council, the secretary-general
said that he made the proposal out of fear that "withdrawal of
international support at this juncture could jeopardize the
objective of completing the creation of the new civilian police
and ensuring for all Haitians the security needed to advance
development and consolidate democracy."
</P>
<P>
The tasks envisaged for the new mission by the
secretary-general are: assistance to the Haitian authorities in
professionalizing the Haitian national police and in maintaining a
secure and stable environment conducive to the success of the
current efforts to establish and train an effective national
police force, and coordination of activities by the U.N. system to
promote institution-building, national reconciliation and economic
rehabilitation in Haiti.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general proposed that the new mission be given
a six-month mandate and an initial strength of 1,200 personnel.
They would be located in Port-au-Prince only and be composed of
one reduced infantry battalion and one reduced reconnaissance
battalion, a helicopter unit, a military police unit, an
engineer unit, transport and logistic elements, as well as
adequate medical support.

<P>
CAIRO, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian security forces killed two
terrorists and arrested seven others today in southern Egypt,
local media reported.
</P>
<P>
The Middle East News Agency (MENA) said that the incident took
place in Sohag, a southern Egyptian town on the bank of the Nile.
</P>
<P>
A security source was quoted as saying that the two terrorists,
identified as Gamal Abdel Hameed Abdel Nasser and Hussein Ismail
Ahmad, were fugitives involved in many terrorist activities.
</P>
<P>
The source said that Nasser spearheaded the military wing of
Al-Gamaa al-Islamiya (the Islamic Group) in southern Egypt, which
was planning new terrorist operations.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Group, Egypt's largest Moslem militant group,
launched a violent campaign against the government four years ago
in an attempt to install strict Islamic rule.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, two traffic policemen were killed by three suspected
Moslem militants in Suez, a city on the southern end of the Suez
Canal. One of the assailants was later arrested.

<P>
LUSAKA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's economic growth rate is
estimated at 6 percent this year, an impressive rise from last
year's negative 3.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The local press today quoted the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) as forecasting the growth, saying the improved outlook is a
result of the policy reform.
</P>
<P>
As for the African continent, the total economic growth is
rated at 5.2 percent from last year's 3 percent. In terms of the
countries with structural reform programs, the growth rate is
expected to be 4.9 percent in 1996 compared with 3.2 percent last
year.
</P>
<P>
However, the IMF warned that the trade situation in Africa may
worsen this year as prices of manufacturers rise almost 3 percent
while comodity prices stagnate. In agriculture, production
figures show that since 1970 there has been no growth in the
african continent.
</P>
<P>
African countries still suffer from heavy debt burden. Despite
debt relief and rescheduling, debt payments continue to rise, the
IMF reported, adding the region's debt-service payments rose 37
percent between 1987 and 1995.

NAIROBI, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan national championships

JOHANNESBURG, June 11 (Xinhua) -- South Africans should
recommit themselves to reconstruction and development, the South
African National Civics Organization (SANCO) said today.
</P>
<P>
There is no clear vision in the direction of the
reconstruction and development program (RDP), said the SANCO in
its economic development document released here.
</P>
<P>
SANCO noted that the lack of direction is impacting negatively
on the central thrust of the RDP to overcome poverty and improve
the quality of lives of all South Africans.
</P>
<P>
The document, titled "Return To The RDP", was SANCO's
contribution to the RDP debate involving the government,
business, labor, and communities.
</P>
<P>
The document called on all South Africans to reclaim the RDP
as the guiding document for the economic and social
transformation of society. South Africans should recommit
themselves to reconstruction and development, growth and
redistribution into a united program, it appealed.
</P>
<P>
Key areas the document addressed included macro-economic
issues, marginalized sectors such as women, youth and disabled,
human and social development, job creation, and co-ordination of
the RDP.

<HEADLINE> Personal Bill on UK's Future in Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 11 (Xinhua) -- A personal bill calling for
referendum on Britain's future in Europe gained its formal first
reading in the parliament by 95 votes to one this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The bill introduced by Bill Cash, a well-known Tory
Eurosceptic, was designed to urge the government to hold a
referendum in Britain on its relations with the European Union
before the 15-state club's inter-governmental conference to be
held on June 21 to 22 in Florence, Italy.
</P>
<P>
Since the debates on the Maastricht Treaty started several
years ago, Cash has put down more than 200 amendments and voted
against the treaty 47 times. In July 1993, he presented a
referendum petition with 350,000 signatures to the House of
Commons.
</P>
<P>
Eighty Tories voted for the bill along with 13 Labour members
of parliament and two Liberal Democratic. Conservative MP Robert
Banks voted against it.
</P>
<P>
The British government and the Opposition Labour officially
abstained in the vote.
</P>
<P>
Although the bill stands little chance of becoming law, it
mirrors the general mood of the British public who fear that
Britain will be dragged into a federalist Europe to be dominated
by Germany.
</P>
<P>
During the debate this afternoon, Cash warned the House of
Commons again that Britain was in danger of being caught up in an
"unaccountable collapsing Europe".
</P>
<P>
"We are surfing on the federal tide of German nationalism," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He also admitted that he gained financial support from
billionaire Sir James Goldsmith, chief of the Referendum Party, who
had claimed to spend 20 million pounds (30 million US dollars) to
oppose Tory candidates who are not committed to referendum.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister John Major reiterated his position today he had
no plan s for a referendum on Britain's future role in Europe
unless the cabinet recommended it.
</P>
<P>
He also dismissed claims that wealthy financier Goldsmith was
influencing Tory policy on Europe.
</P>
<P>
Major told the parliament: "Anyone with 20 million pounds to
spend can afford to do that, but he is not going to change our
policy."

<HEADLINE> Pakistan's Foreign Trade Increases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's export rose 5.9
percent and import 16.5 percent during the first nine months of
the current fiscal year of July 1995-June 96, according to the
Economic Survey 1995-96 released here today.
</P>
<P>
The export during July 1995-April 1996 amounted to 6.74 billion
US dollars as against 6.36 billion dollars in the same period of
the previous year, said the survey, which is prepared by the
government's Finance Division every year and released before the
announcement of the budget for the next fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The import, on the other hand, aggregated at 9.57 billion
dollars during the first nine months of the current fiscal year as
against 8.21 billion dollars in the corresponding period of the
previous fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The trade deficit in the period under review amounted to 2.83
billion dollars as against 1.98 billion dollars estimated in the
budget for the whole year.
</P>
<P>
The survey said that the volume of export is expected to depict
further upward trend in the remaining three months of the current
fiscal year as since the rupee's devaluation in October 1995, the
monthly export figures have been buoyant.
</P>
<P>
The increase in export mainly stemmed from higher exports of
raw cotton, cotton yarn, cotton fabrics, raw wool, bedwear,
tarpaulin and canvas, vegetables, towels and surgical instruments.
</P>
<P>
The higher import bill primarily stemmed from increased imports
of machinery, petroleum products, chemicals, iron and steel, paper
and paper board, etc., the survey said.

<HEADLINE> Developed Countries Called On to Increase Aid for Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Some 1,600 women in developing
countries die and tens of thousands of others are disabled every
day giving birth, a United Nations report said today.
</P>
<P>
Childbirth is the leading cause of death and disability among
young women in the developing world, the U.N. Children's Fund
(UNICEF) said.
</P>
<P>
Executive Director Carol Bellamy described the worsening
problem as "one of the most neglected tragedies of our time" and
urged developed countries to increase aid for children in the
developing world.
</P>
<P>
Industrialized countries have cut health care aid to its lowest
level in 20 years, at merely 0.3 percent of their gross national
product (GNP), less than half the targets set in 1970s, she said.
</P>
<P>
With the end of the Cold War, rich countries have cut their
overall defense spending by a quarter, saving 250 billion
U.S. dollars each year. But aid from these countries to
developing countries has increased by only one billion dollars
every year.
</P>
<P>
She said that while Norway, Denmark and the Netherlands are in
the forefront in aid donations, the United States is lagging far
behind in providing financial assistance.
</P>
<P>
Aid from the United States accounts for only 0.15 percent of
its GNP and 18 percent of its aid goes to Israel and Egypt.

<HEADLINE> U.S Delivers More Heavy Oil to DPRK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The Unite States has shipped
another 37,800 tons of heavy fuel oil to the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) under a 1994 accord, reports said today.
</P>
<P>
The oil, the May installment of the 500,000 tons to be
delivered to the DPRK from last November to this October, arrived at
the northeastern port of Sonbong on June 4.
</P>
<P>
Some 210,00 tons of heavy oil has been shipped to the DPRK by
May.
</P>
<P>
Under the Washington-Pyongyang framework agreement signed in
October 1994, Washington is to provide two light-water reactors
and an annual 500,000 tons of heavy oil as fuel energy to the DPRK.
</P>

<HEADLINE> DPRK Raps Japanese Ex-Minister's Claim Over Comfort Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Claims by a former Japanese
minister that so-called "comfort women" who worked as sex slaves
for the Japanese army were recruited as a "commercial activity and
were not forced" were condemned today by a leading newspaper of
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
</P>
<P>
Rodong Sinmun, the official newspaper of the ruling Workers'
Party of Korea, said Seisuke Okuno's remarks, made at a press
conference last week, don't merely represent his personal stand,
since other Japanese right-wing forces have also tried to justify
the aggression and crimes of Japanese imperialists in Asian
countries, including the "comfort women" issue, and have refused
to provide compensation to the women.
</P>
<P>
By refusing to acknowledge this historical fact, the Japanese
authorities seek to flee responsibility for past crimes and make
no state and legal compensation, said the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
As many as 200,000 women, mostly Koreans, served as sex slaves
for Japanese soldiers before and during the World War II. Japan
ruled the Korean Peninsula from 1910 to 1945.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government has been urged by the United Nations
and Asian countries to accept legal responsibility for "comfort
women." But Tokyo has insisted that it is not legally bound to
compensate individual victims, saying it has settled all claims
under the 1965 Japan-South Korea Basic Treaty which normalized
relations between the two countries.

JOHANNESBURG, June 11 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's National
Council of Provinces would have to play a central role in
ensuring that national unity was balanced with the need for
diversity, Deputy President Thabo Mbeki said today.
</P>
<P>
Delivering his budget vote speech in the senate, Mbeki said
South Africa would continuously be confronted by the need to
balance the push of centrifugal forces in society with those
pushing away from the centre.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said the senate, reconstituted as the National Council of
Provinces under the newly-adopted constitution, would be the most
exposed to the impact of such a centrifugal tendency.
</P>
<P>
The deputy president noted the new constitution required that
all spheres of government and state had to preserve the peace,
national unity and the indivisibility of the republic.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Agencies Call for More Food Aid For the DPRK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, June 10 (Xinhua) -- United Nations aid agencies
today appealed to the international community for more food to
help ease the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's (DPRK)
severe food shortage caused by last year's devastating floods.
</P>
<P>
Representatives in the DPRK of the United Nations Development
Program, the World Food Program (WFP), United Nations Children's
Fund made their appeal to foreign diplomats.
</P>
<P>
The food shortage will continue to cause major problems for the
country well before this year's harvest, they added. The food
situation there is so serious that the aid agencies called on all
countries, organizations and groups who can, to continue or begin
to supply food to the starving population.
</P>
<P>
The WFP's resident representative in DPRK, R. Hauser will go to
Beijing soon to persuade foreign diplomats there to put pressure
on their own governments to provide more food aid.
</P>
<P>
The floods last July and October in the DPRK's South Hwanghae
Province and other grain-producing areas left more than 500,000
people homeless and exacerbated the country's acute food
shortage. International aid in various forms has since poured
into the country, but aid workers say it is not enough.

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Speaker of the National
Assembly (parliament) Saadoun Hammadi told visiting Russian Deputy
Foreign Minister Victor Bosuvalyuk here today that the U.N. must
put into practice para 22 of resolution 687 despite the Iraq-U.N.
oil deal signed last month.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with the Russian official, Hammadi said that
the oil-for-food memorandum of understanding signed on may 20
between Iraq and the U.N. should not be an alternative to putting
para 22 of resolution 687 into effect, which provides for a total
lifting of U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq for its 1990 invasion of
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Bosuvalyuk, who arrived here Sunday, stressed the importance of
enhancing friendly ties and cooperation between Iraq and Russia,
adding that his country will continue its efforts to put para 22
of U.N. resolution 687 into practice and urge the U.N. Special
Commission on Disarming Iraq to accomplish its task as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
The Russian official said that he came here to discuss with
Iraqi officials the best means to hasten the lifting of the
U.N. embargo imposed on Iraq and enhance the role of Russian
companies in meeting Iraqi people's needs of food and medicine in
accordance with the Iraq-U.N. oil-for-food accord.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed the importance of strengthening ties between
parliaments of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Iraqi Minister of Culture and Information and acting
Foreign Minister Abdul Ghani Abdul Ghafour also met with the
visiting Russian deputy foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Ghafour stressed the importance of
development in bilateral relations with Russia as well as Iraq's
keenness to boosting the ties in the common interests of both
countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Iraq-U.N. deal which enables Iraq to export 2
billion U.S. dollars of oil every six months to buy food and other
supplies, reflects Iraq's cooperation with the United Nations.

<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, June 11 (Xinhua) -- A Mongolian weekly today
carried an article to denounce a Russian newspaper for
unilaterally publishing the figure of debt Mongolia owes Russia.
</P>
<P>
The World News article said that the debt issue has been an
obstacle blocking the bilateral relations between Mongolia and
Russia.
</P>
<P>
It described the story on the Russian newspaper of Arguments
and Facts as regrettable in that the newspaper cannot provide
proof for its report which claims Mongolia to be the second
largest debtor nation and to owe Russia 18 billion U.S. dollars in
all.
</P>
<P>
The Russian newspaper attributed its source to a research
center of social studies under the Federation of the Russian
Commercial Round-Table.
</P>
<P>
The World News weekly article hinted that the research center
was not an official institution entrusted to publish state
statistics.
</P>
<P>
The article quoted Russian Duma (lower house of parliament)
Chairman Gennady Seleznev as saying that Russia should not
consider past aid given gratis to Mongolia as debt and that Russia
should reduce the total amount of debt owed by Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
The lower house speaker made the remark at a Moscow press
conference not long ago upon returning from a Mongolia visit.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea to Provide Food Aid to DPRK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 11 (Xinhua) -- South Korea decided today to give
three million U.S. dollars in food aid to the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK), Deputy Prime Minister and National
Unification Board Minister Kwon O-kie said.
</P>
<P>
Seoul will provide the aid to the DPRK through international
relief organizations "on humanitarian and brotherly-love grounds",
Kwon told reporters here after a meeting of unification-related
ministers.
</P>
<P>
Of the aid, two million dollars will be in cash for the DPRK to
buy powdered food for children, such as powdered milk, and the
remaining one million will be in powdered milk for babies.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's decision was made following the United Nations
appeal for 43.6 million dollars in emergency aid to help ease the
food shortages caused by devastating floods in the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
The Seoul government will thus resume food aid to the DPRK nine
months after it shipped 150,000 tons of rice to Pyongyang late
last year.
</P>
<P>
However, South Korean officials said Seoul is not going to give
the DPRK a large amount of aid unless it meets the conditions for
such aid.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Japan will also provide the DPRK with several
million dollars in food aid respectively.

SEOUL, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The Seoul District Court today
sentenced Chang Hak-ro, a former secretary of South Korean
President Kim Young-sam, to a five-year prison term and a
785,000-U.S.-dollar fine for graft charges.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chang's girlfriend Kim Mi-ja, indicted on charges of
illegally acquiring real estate worth 625,000 dollars, was
sentenced to a one-year prison term with a two-year reprieve.
</P>
<P>
Kim Mi-ja's elder brother Kim Ui-ryung, indicted on similar
charges, was given one and a half year with a three-year reprieve.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the prosecution demanded a seven-year prison term for
Chang, who was charged with taking 900,000 U.S. dollars in
kickbacks from 17 companies while in office from January 1990 to
last March.
</P>
<P>
Chang, 45, became an aide to President Kim in 1977 and was his

February 1993, Chang was named a presidential secretary in charge
of Kim's personal matters.

Following Chang's arrest last March, President Kim apologized

administering authorities, so that they can transform the life of
the rural population.
</P>
<P>
Financiers for the program are the British Overseas
Development Association, Swedish International Donor Agency, the
Netherlands government and the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
To achieve the desired goal, rural district councils will have
to develop their capacity to plan, implement and manage their own
developmental programs as well as provide essential services to
the rural population.
</P>
<P>
"There are three components of the program which are
institutional development, human resources development and
capital development, all of which are interlinked and depend
greatly on one another," said Nkomo.

<HEADLINE> Japan Studies Ways to Support U.S. Troops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tokyo, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese government is studying
the feasibility of allowing its troops to provide U.S. forces with
logistics support in military emergencies in the Far East region,
according to local newspaper reports today.
</P>
<P>
But the proposal has been attacked by some observers, who say
it violates the spirit of Japan's pacifist constitution and
heightens Japan's military role.
</P>
<P>
A senior Foreign Ministry official was quoted by newspaper
reports here as saying that providing U.S. troops with water, oil
and weapon parts are the "minimum" Japan would have to supply in
military situations.
</P>
<P>
The reports said the Japanese government is investigating ways,
including military measures, to ensure that these supplies can be
exchanged during military crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government has traditionally ruled out logistics
support to U.S. troops in emergencies, saying it considered such
actions unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
But as both countries work more closely on defense roles in the
region, expectations that Japan will move to provide logistics
support have been raised.
</P>
<P>
Consultations are due to start soon on revising existing
guidelines for defense cooperation laid down in 1978, in line with
an agreement between Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and
U.S. President Bill Clinton in April to boost bilateral security
ties.
</P>
<P>
The two countries also recently signed an acquisition and cross
servicing agreement, allowing Japan's Self-Defense Forces and the
U.S. military in Japan to support each other with a total of 15
items of logistics supplies and duties, including
telecommunications, medical and sanitary duties, when they conduct
exercises.
</P>
<P>
However, there are no stipulations for specific joint measures
during a military crisis in the Far East region within the
existing guidelines, which say only that Japan should "study ways
of how it would support U.S. forces" in such crisis.
</P>
<P>
So Japan's Defense Agency is calling for specific guidelines on
what Japan can do in military emergencies. The newspaper reports
said the agency wants, for example, to formulate guidelines for
support to the United States, similar to those Washington has with
members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

<P>
MAPUTO, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Stagnant sale of grain has been
reported in the northern Mozambican provinces of Cabo and Delgado
and the central province of Manica.
</P>
<P>
At least 190000 tons of grain in the three provinces are in
danger of perish because of the selling difficulties, warned
the Mozambique Information Agency today.
</P>
<P>
The stagnant grain sale was attributed to the lack of selling
network and the necessary credit in the country.
</P>
<P>
While the southern provinces are still suffering grain
shortages, the northern grain has to be left where it is as the
transport cost is too high for the south, the information agency
said.

Stockholm, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The traditional Swedish practise
of closing down industrial plant completely in July may be living
on borrowed time, according to local press reports today.
</P>
<P>
The normal practise of shutting down businesses in Sweden is
intended to allow workers to take full advantage of the brief,

</P>
<P>
However, some companies now are shortening the period of fixed
vacations, while others are dispensing with the tradition entirely.

"We have chosen to adapt to the international system in order

<HEADLINE> Global Sales of PCs With Multimedia Doubled in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Global sales of multimedia
computers more than doubled to 20.8 million units last year as
demand soared in Europe and Asia, according to a study by the
Dataquest Inc., a well-known U.S. research group in the field.
</P>
<P>
However, it said, all the U.S. PC manufacturers saw their
shares declined as non-U.S. companies gained ground in the market
of the desktop computers which combine text, sound and complex
graphics.
</P>
<P>
Although Apple Computer Inc. of the U.S. led the market for a
third consecutive year, capturing a 19 percent market share, its
share was also down, from 23 percent a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. market for multimedia personal computers increased by
35 percent in 1995, sales jumped fourfold in the Asia-Pacific
region and more than doubled in Europe, Dataquest said. Total 1994
sales were 10.3 million units.
</P>
<P>
The technical research company predicted that multimedia
computers will have a much higher market share in Asia than in the
U.S.
</P>
<P>
Multimedia machines accounted for 42 percent of PC sales in the
U.S. during the past 18 months. In Asia, they already account for
more than half of all personal computers sold, according to the
company.
</P>
<P>
Packard Bell Electronics Inc. finished second with a 14 percent
share, down from 19 percent a year ago. Compaq computer Corp. was
third, with 9.3 percent, down from 12 percent. International
Business Machines Corp. came in fourth, with 7.4 percent compared
with 8 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Japan's NEC Corp. was in fifth place, with its market share
increasing to 7.0 percent from 4.3 percent in 1994. All other
companies combined had a market share of 43 percent, up 11 points
from a year earlier, according to the research group.

<HEADLINE> EC Adopts Regulation on British Beef By-Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brussels, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC)
today adopted a regulation on particular processing techniques and
controls in manufacturing beef byproducts in Britain.
</P>
<P>
However, in announcing the measure, specifically regarding the
production of gelatin and tallow, an EC spokesman said much has to
be done before exports of the two products can recommence.
</P>
<P>
"Once all of the processing techniques and controls are put in
place," the spokesman said, "the Commission will carry out an
on-the-spot inspection to verify that all of the provisions of the
regulation are being respected."
</P>
<P>
Following a further consultation of the EC's Standing
Veterinary Committee, the EC shall set the date on which exports
of gelatin and tallow can start again.
</P>
<P>
In the case of British bovine semen, scientific experts have
concluded that it represents no health risk.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the EC said, the export ban on this product can be
lifted without any preconditions or controls being put in place.
</P>
<P>
According to the regulation on gelatin and tallow, the products
should be accompanied by a health certificate issued by an
official veterinarian when dispatched to other member states; and
the products should be labelled to show the method and
establishment of production.
</P>
<P>
It is also demanded that the bovine raw material should be
obtained only from animals which are less than 30 months of age,
and should exclude certain tissues such as brain and spinal cord.

<HEADLINE> ICRC Withdraws Staff from Burundi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The International Committee of Red
Cross (ICRC) said that all its staff has left Burundi Tuesday
afternoon after three ICRC workers were killed in an attack on
June 4.
</P>
<P>
It said it made the withdrawal decision out of security concern
for its staff in Burundi, who have now arrived in Nairobi and will
stay there indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
ICRC said it cannot decide at the moment when the about 40
workers will be back in Bujumbura and that all its relief
operations in Burundi are from now on suspended.
</P>
<P>
ICRC asked for the government of Burundi to investigate the
June 4 incident, and expressed regret over its withdrawal, by
which it said many victims of the conflict in the country will not
be able to get the assistance they need.
</P>
<P>
In protest against the June 4 killing of ICRC workers, the
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), World Food
Programme (WFP), the World Health Organization (WHO) and the
United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) have decided to
suspend for 24 hours their relief operations.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in
Burundi suspended their activities since last Friday, saying they
would resume work a week later.

Brussels, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Top leaders of the European Union
(EU) is arriving in Washington Wednesday to hold the alliance's
bi-annual summit meeting with U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The EU leaders to visit the United States include President of
the European Commission (EC) Jacques Santer and Trade Commissioner
Sir Leon Brittan, together with the EC's Italian Presidency.
</P>
<P>
The Summit, to take place in the White House, is the first
since the EU and the United States signed the New Trans-Atlantic
Agenda last December in Madrid to boost their relations.
</P>
<P>
An EC spokesman said that the summit will give the leaders a
chance to review progress made in implementing the New
Trans-Atlantic Agenda, as well as to set new priorities for work
in the second half of this year.
</P>
<P>
The Agenda aims to progressively build stronger ties between
the EU and the United States in four key policy areas so that they
can take joint action rather than just consult each other.
</P>
<P>
The areas are: promoting peace, stability and development
worldwide; tackling crime, drugs, pollution and other global
challenges; promoting science, education, cultural and business
links across the Atlantic and creating a "New Trans-Atlantic
Marketplace" by removing barriers to each other's business while
working to expand world trade.

<HEADLINE> China Calls on ILO to Focus on Job Promotion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- China's Minister of Labour Li
Boyong said here on Tuesday that the International Labour
Organization (ILO) should readjust its policies in a rapidly
changing world and give top priority to employment promotion and
poverty eradication.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the 83rd session of the International Labour
Conference, Li stressed that special attention should be given to
economic development and job promotion in the Third World
countries.
</P>
<P>
"It is absolutely ill-advised to assess problems facing
developing countries with the Western standard," li said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that in view of globalization, it is necessary
to conduct extensive regional or global cooperation. But as far as
cooperation in the field of labor and employment is concerned,
several principles should be followed.
</P>
<P>
Principles outlined by the Chinese minister include: all
countries should treat each other as an equal partner instead of
imposing one's own will on others; encouraging mutually beneficial
cooperation instead of imposing sanctions at will.
</P>
<P>
Li also stressed that rich countries should shoulder more
responsibilities and actively help developing countries to
eradicate poverty, reduce unemployment and promote common
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
"Any action contrary to this will only undermine the
development of world trade, and in particular the efforts made by
developing countries to promote development and employment," Li
said.

<HEADLINE> IFOR Says 100-200 Mujaheddin Remain in Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, June 11 (Xinhua) -- There are still between 100 to
200 mujaheddin in Bosnia, much more than Washington says, a senior
IFOR commander said in Sarajevo today.
</P>
<P>
Commander of the ground troops of the multinational peace
Implementation Force (IFOR), Gen. Michael Walker, told reporters
in the Sarajevo suburb of Ilidza that, according to evidence
available to IFOR, there were still between 100 and 200
pro-Iranian Islamic fighters in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Walker added that he was surprised at the U.S. State
Department's recent information that there are only four Islamic
fighters of Iranian nationality in Bosnia now, according to Tanjug
news agency.
</P>
<P>
During the three-and-half-year civil war in Bosnia that ended
late last year, thousands of foreign fighters, most of whom
mujaheddins, were fighting in the country on one of the three
sides -- Muslims, Serbs and Croats.
</P>
<P>
Under the Dayton agreement, all the mercenaries in Bosnia,
viewed as a threat to the NATO-led IFOR troops, must leave the
country by January 19. However, some mujaheddins still managed to
remain in Bosnia with support from the Muslim government.
</P>
<P>
The United States, which has contributed 20,000 soldiers to the
IFOR in Bosnia, has conditioned military assistance to the
Muslim-Croat with the expulsion of mujaheddin and other foreign
mercenaries from Bosnia.

ATHENS, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Greece current accounts deficit
stood at 694 million dollars in February, compared to 578.3
million dollars in the same month of 1995, according to figures
released today by the bank of Greece.
</P>
<P>
In the first two months of 1996, the balance of current
accounts showed a deficit of 328 million dollars, against a
surplus of 142.3 million dollars in the corresponding period last
year.
</P>
<P>
This development reflects the 100 million dollars increase in
the trade deficit and the drop of 370 million dollars in the
invisibles surplus in the same period.
</P>
<P>
Both imports and exports showed low rates of growth compared to
January-February 1995, resulting in an increase of 3.8 percent in
the trade deficit to reach 2,780 million dollars compared to 2,680
million dollars last year.
</P>

Meanwhile, the country's net foreign borrowing of the public

promote their country's economy.
</P>
<P>
Soon Tae Kwon made the call when he toured the Athi River

<P>
He said Kenya is geographically well located and that its

<P>
He urged Thai businessmen to especially invest in Kenya's

for their capital.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan Minister made the remarks while holding discussions

<HEADLINE> Ghana Refuses Review of Liberia's Peace Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Ghana on Monday rejected demands by
six Liberian factions for a review of the Abuja peace accord
signed last August to end the six-year war in Liberia.
</P>
<P>
"We won't review the accord. It will be implemented in full,"
said Ghanaian Foreign Minister Obed Asamoah, quoted by a report
which reached here today.
</P>
<P>
Six militias involved in the current conflict in Liberia on
Saturday called for a meeting of signatories to the accord for a
review of the document in a letter to Ghanaian President Jerry
Rawlings.
</P>
<P>
They said the meeting, which they want to be held outside
Liberia, was the only way to bring a truce to their country.
</P>
<P>
But Asamoah said no more money would be spent in holding more
conferences on Liberia.
</P>
<P>
"At the last meeting of the Committee of Nine in Accra, we
made it clear that it was the last framework for resolving the
conflict and that they should take its outcome seriously. They
must learn to cooperate with each other instead of calling for a
review of the accord," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The Committee of Nine comprises the foreign ministers of the
nine members of the Economic Community of West African States
which is overseeing the peace process in Liberia.

<HEADLINE> (Round-Up): British Energy Sale Accused of Unnecessary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The controversy surrounding nuclear
privatization is intensifying in Britain as the Labour Party
accused the government of lying to the people and misleading
parliament over details of next month's sale of British Energy.
</P>
<P>
The sale of British Energy, the only pure nuclear power company
in the world, was launched by the government on Monday with a
cautious prospectus suggesting it will raise for less than 2.6bn
pounds (3.9bn US dollars) planned.
</P>
<P>
The caution surrounding the offer reflects concern about
possible declines in electricity prices, the cost of
decommissioning nuclear plants and their fuel, and the impact of a
possible change in government on electricity regulations.
</P>
<P>
Economic analysts here estimated from the prospectus that the
government might secure only 2bn-2.4bn pounds (3bn-3.6bn US
dollars) from the sale and repayment of debt.
</P>
<P>
Tim Eggar, the industry minister declared the floatation a
success and "a major milestone" in the government's privatization
program. Up to 700 million shares in the company, representing
the government's entire stake, are being sold. More than 750,000
private investors have registered for shares, which will be on the
stock market next month, the minister added.
</P>
<P>
However, the Labour Party accused the government of lying to
the public and misleading parliament over details of next month's
sale of British Energy, which is aimed to raise money to help fund
pre-election tax-cuts. The Party also attacked the big pay
increases detailed in the pathfinder for British Energy's main
board directors.
</P>
<P>
It is revealed that total directors' remuneration will increase
by 38 percent to l.057m pounds (1.5855m US dollars) in the year to
March 1997. The deputy chairman, Robin Jeffrey, will receive a 26
percent increase in his basic salary to 157,000 pounds (235,000 US
dollars) when the company is floated on the stock market. The
highest-paid director is the chief executive, Robert Hawley, whose
basic salary is 207,000 pounds (310,500 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
John Battle, the shadow energy minister, said the main "Tory
lie" was the government's failure to ensure that there were enough
funds to deal with long-term nuclear liabilities. He said: "This
sale is subsidized to a quite unprecedented degree."
</P>
<P>
The shadow minister added: "It is an extraordinarily bad deal
for the tax-payers and if it goes ahead under these terms then a
Labour government would certainly have to examine the regulatory
framework in which British Energy operates."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the controversy sale of British Energy, the
Guardian newspaper writes in an editorial entitled "An Unnecessary
Privatization": "With huge amounts of the taxpayers' money at
stake and potentially catastrophic disposal problems, no time
should have been spared to ensure that this sale was not only
clear but seen to be clear."

<HEADLINE> Tunisian President Meets with Iraqi FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TUNIS, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Tunisian President Zine al-Abidine
Ben Ali met here today with visiting Iraqi Foreign Minister
Mohammed Saeed al-Sahaf.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the Iraqi foreign minister said that he had
briefed President Ben Ali about the recent development of
relations between Iraq and the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
He said Iraq now enjoyed a relative relaxation after the
signing of the memorandum of understanding between Iraq and the
U.N. on May 20, which allows Iraq to export 2 billion U.S. dollars
worth of oil over a six-month period to buy food and other
humanitarian goods for its people, who have been suffering for
nearly six years due to sanctions imposed on Iraq for its invasion
of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
He expressed Iraq's expectations for future cooperation with
the U.N. Security Council in a bid to lift the full sanctions on
the country.
</P>
<P>
Sahaf said his meeting with President Ben Ali also covered
bilateral relations and ways of enhancing Tunisian-Iraqi ties.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi foreign minister, who arrived in Tunis Sunday on a
working visit, had earlier had talks with his Tunisian counterpart
Habib Ben Yahia on the development of relations between Iraq and
the U.N. Security Council and the consequences of the memorandum
of understanding, as well as international and regional issues of
mutual concern.

<HEADLINE> 8th Arab Games Postponed to Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The Eighth Arab Games, which had
been scheduled to be held here this September, was postponed to
October 1997, Robert Ghanem, Lebanese minister of the national
education, youth and sport, announced here today.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese minister attributed the postponement to the
"difficult situations" in the region, as well as the failure of
some Arab countries to cash the financial aids which they had
promised Lebanon for the rebuilding of sports installations.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference in his office, Ghanem quoted a report
prepared by a high-ranking official of the Arab Council of
Ministers of Sports and Youth as saying that contacts conducted
by the official to press for the aids "have not brought positive
results."
</P>
<P>
He said that his country needs some 24 million U.S. dollars to
complete the big stadium and its surrounding buildings, and
another 23 million dollars, on which Lebanon was promised but has
not got the cash, to run the games.
</P>
<P>
"It is regrettable for the brother countries not to contribute
and to carry out what they have promised," he said. "We understand
the conditions of all Arab countries, and we hope the Arab
countries to understand the condition of Lebanon."
</P>
<P>
He said that Lebanon decided to "postpone the date of the
Eighth Arab games to the first week in October, 1997, in view of
the difficult regional situations which the Arab nation is
experiencing."
</P>
<P>
The postponement of the Arab games will inevitably affect
the confidence of the Lebanese people since they have regarded the
Sports City in Beirut, where the games is to be held, as a symbol
of the government's ambitious plan to reconstruct and to
rehabilitate the country, the Lebanese minister said.
</P>
<P>
The Sports City was destroyed during Lebanon's 1975-90 civil
war.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to make the Arab games into a celebration of the
achievements in the reconstruction, the government of Prime
Minister Rafik al-Hariri started to rebuild the Sports City
before the end of 1994.

<HEADLINE> 21 Arab League Members to Attend Arab Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-one of the 22 members of the
Arab League will attend the Arab summit due to be held in Cairo from
June 21-23, as Somalia will be represented by its ambassador to
the league.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Middle East News Agency (MENA) today quoted
informed sources as saying that the Somali ambassador has received
an invitation to participate in the summit, which will be the
largest gathering of Arab leaders since the 1991 Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
The local media reported earlier that Somalia would be
unable to attend because of the country's anarchy.
</P>
<P>
Iraq is the only Arab League member to be excluded from the
three-day summit. Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak has said that
Iraq will not be invited because "the wounds of the Iraqi invasion
of Kuwait haven't been healed yet."
</P>
<P>
Iraq's invasion of its oil-rich neighbor in 1990 split the Arab
world.
</P>
<P>
Osama al-Baz, Mubarak's top aide, said today that the summit
would focus on Arab solidarity and the election of right-wing
Likud leader Benjamin Netanyahu as Israel's prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak, Syrian President Hafez al-Assad and Saudi Arabian
Crown Prince Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz called for the summit after
their two-day meeting in Damascus, Syria Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The summit is aimed at coordinating Arab stances to save the
Middle East peace process, jeopardized by Netanyahu's statements
that he would take a tougher line than that of his predecessor
Shimon Peres in Israel's negotiations with the Palestinians and
Syria, Arab officials said.
</P>
<P>
Baz said that the summit will not threaten Israel.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Wholesale Prices Down by 0.1 Percent in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Wholesale prices in U.S.
declined by 0.1 percent in May, the first decrease since a similar
0.1 percent drop in February, the U.S. Labor Department reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The decline was caused by the drop of energy prices in the
month. Energy prices fell by 0.6 percent following a period when
gasoline prices had been rising at the fastest pace since the
Persian Gulf crisis nearly six years ago.
</P>
<P>
Food prices were also well-behaved for the second straight
month in May, showing no change following an actual decline of 0.3
percent in April.
</P>
<P>
With the decline in May, wholesale prices were rising at an
annual rate of 2.2 percent in the first five months of this year,
comparing with a 2.1 percent rise for the same period in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Excluding the volatile food and energy sectors, the so-called
core rate of wholesale inflation was rising at an annual rate of
0.3 percent this year, down sharply from a 2.8 percent rise last
year.
</P>
<P>
U.S. economists are split on whether the U.S. Federal Reserve
(Fed) will raise interest rates when policy-makers of Fed next
meet on July 2-3. The U.S. economy is expanding at annual rate of
around 3.5 percent at the present quarter of April to June but the
inflation is kept well under control.

<HEADLINE> British Airways In Biggest Global Link </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 11 (Xinhua) - British Airways and American
Airlines today announced plans for a broad alliance that will
improve aviation services for consumers and broaden the reach of
both carriers.
</P>
<P>
An official from British Airways told this reporter in an
interview that from April 1997, the two airlines will co-ordinate
their passenger and cargo activities between Europe and the USA,
introduce entensive code-sharing across each other's networks and
establish full reciprocity between their frequent flyer
program.
</P>
<P>
British Airways and American Airlines are urging the
Governments of the UK and the USA to negotiate without delay a
liberalized bilateral air services agreement between the two
countries, to open the market to greater competition and
facilitate regulatory approval of the new alliance.
</P>
<P>
No exchange of equity or other forms of cross-shareholding are
involved. The two companies will remain separate entities,
retaining their own identities, brands and nationalities. Each
will continue to operate with its own aircraft and crews with no
reduction in transatlantic flying by either airline, the official
said.
</P>
<P>
The intention of British Airways and American Airlines is that
their existing alliances will remain in place. Both carriers are
prepared to discuss with US Air proposals that they believe will
strengthen US Air's position and enhance its association with
British Airways and the new alliance, the official added.
</P>
<P>
British Airlines' managing director Bob Ayling linked the deal
to what he hoped was progress on an overall bilateral +open skies+
access deal between Britain and the United States.
</P>
<P>
American Airlines' president Don Carty said he expected
approval for the scheme within months.

DAMASCUS, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Three loan agreements worth 59
million Kuwaiti dinars (about 195 million U.S. dollars) were

NICOSIA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Official Figures show that more
people die in road accidents in Cyprus than in any other European
country.

<P>
This year alone, 51 persons have died in road accidents, most of
which were caused by excessive speed. In May alone, 17 people were

<HEADLINE> UNICEF: Pregnancy, Childbirth Cause 600,000 Deaths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Almost 600,000 women die in
pregnancy and childbirth each year and 30 times more suffer
serious pregnancy-related injuries in developing countries, said a
yearly report from the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF).
</P>
<P>
The report, titled "The Progress of Nations 1996" and released
in Paris today, said that the process of bringing new life into
the world is a major cause of death and disability among young
women in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
New data show that one in 13 women in sub-Saharan Africa dies
of maternal causes, as does one in 35 women in South Asia. The
figure for Western Europe is one woman in 3,200. In the United
States, it is one in 3,300, and one in 7,300 in Canada.
</P>
<P>
Compiled by UNICEF, the World Health Organization and Johns
Hopkins University, the new and comprehensive data show a 20
percent increase over previous estimates.
</P>
<P>
The most common causes of death during pregnancy and childbirth
each year include:
</P>
<P>
-- 140,000 from haemorrhaging;
</P>
<P>
-- 75,000 from attempting to abort themselves;
</P>
<P>
-- 100,000 from sepsis; and
</P>
<P>
-- 40,000 from obstructed labor.
</P>
<P>
In addition, one quarter of all adult women in the developing
world are affected by injuries related to pregnancy and
childbirth. The most distressing is fistula, which leaves an
estimated 80,000 women a year injured and incontinent.
</P>
<P>
If the toll of maternal death and injury is to be reduced, then
the silence that surrounds the issue has to be broken. Family
planning services should be available to all who need them; good
quality health care be provided before, during and after
pregnancy; women need better education and better nutrition,
according to the UNICEF report.
</P>
<P>
But above all else, every pregnant woman needs access to
skilled obstetric care -- to the same obstetric skills that made
the difference in the industrialized world in the early part of
this century, the report added.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Reports Child Malnutrition, Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Malnutrition rates for
under-fives are significantly higher in South Asia than in Africa,
according to the latest report of the United Nations Children's
Fund (UNICEF).
</P>
<P>
The report, "The Progress of Nations 1996," said that half of
the world's malnourished children are to be found in just three
Asian countries -- Bangladesh, India and Pakistan -- where
malnutrition rates are typically twice as high as in the poor
countries of sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
The likely explanations for South Asia's high rates of
malnutrition seem to be the region's far higher rates of babies
with low birth weight, the generally lower status of many Asian
women, the far greater population density, poorer hygiene and less
satisfactory patterns of breast feeding and weaning.
</P>
<P>
On social issues in the industrialized world, the report,
released in Paris today, revealed that the United States has the
largest number of poor children, with more than one in five of its
children below the poverty line. Four other countries --
Australia, Canada, Ireland and Israel -- have child poverty rates
of more than 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
In other developments, Sweden heads a new literacy league,
Japan has the lowest teen birth rate, Finland the most 15-year-old
smokers, and the Russian Federation the highest child accident
rate. Most young (15-24) suicides are committed in Finland,
Latvia, Lithuania, New Zealand, the Russian Federation and
Slovenia, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Pacific Economies to Have Steady Growth in 1996-97: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 11 (Xinhua) -- After a soft landing in most
part of the Pacific economies in 1995, the region is predicted to
have faster economic growth in 1996-1997, the Pacific Economic
Cooperation Council (PECC) said today.
</P>
<P>
It noted in its annual Pacific Economic Outlook that in 1995
not all 18 PECC economies followed the pattern of slower real
growth of GDP and ebbing inflation. Six economies -- Chile,
Indonesia, South Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam --
actually experienced higher real growth.
</P>
<P>
The report said the weighted average growth of GDP is expected
to reach 3.9 percent in 1996, up 0.4 percent from 1995, and to
expand even further to 4.2 percent in 1997. If this forecast is
achieved, then the region's growth would still be below the boom
year of 1994, but would appear to be entirely sustainable.
</P>
<P>
The PECC said China's real GDP growth is expected to reach 9.0
percent in 1996 but slower down to 8.5 percent in 1997 while the
consumer price index declined from 17.1 percent in 1995 to 12.6
percent in 1996 and further to 9.2 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The report said China should accelerate reform of its
state-owned enterprise (SOE) system to help assure progress in
realizing a "soft landing" and stabilizing the economy.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the SOE's were in serious deficit with 43.7
percent of them losing money by October 1995. Intra-enterprise
debt was also very serious. "The only way to overcome these
problems is to accelerate enterprise reform," it asserted.
</P>
<P>
The report added, "Given its necessity for economic
development, we can expect that economic reform, especially
enterprise reform, will go forward in 1996 and in several
subsequent years. This will assure progress in assuring a 'soft
landing' and stabilizing the economy."
</P>
<P>
The PECC's Outlook said the South Korean economy is expected to
achieve a soft landing in 1996-97 as there is no indication of
overheating in the current economic upswing.
</P>
<P>
"It is anticipated that the real growth rates of exports and
imports will be 10-12 percent, resulting in current account
deficits of around 5-6 billion U.S. dollars in 1996 and 7-8
billion dollars in 1997," the report said. This compares with the
current account deficit of 8.8 billion dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
About Malaysia, the report said its economic outlook for 1996
looks very favorable and GDP growth should be around 8.9 percent
as against 9.6 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Despite economic growth of more than 8 percent in 1996,
inflation is not expected to worsen. The consumer price index is
forecast to grow by 3.3 percent as compared with a rise of 3.4
percent in the last year, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The PECC is a non-governmental organization devoted to
promoting economic cooperation in the Pacific Rim. It now
comprises 22 member committees representing the economies of
Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia, Hong Kong,
Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand,
Peru, the Philippines, Russia, Singapore, Chinese Taipei,
Thailand, the United States and Vietnam as well as the Pacific
Island Nations.

million US dollars) were listed in the new plan down from 81
