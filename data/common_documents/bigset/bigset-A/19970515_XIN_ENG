<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The British government has expressed
its concern over the reported clashes between Turkish troops and
Kurdish forces in northern Iraq and urged Turkish government to
exercise restraint.
</P>
<P>
British foreign office minister Doug Henderson said in a
statement issued this afternoon that the British government was
"concerned that Turkish troops are reported to be advancing over
the border with Northern Iraq in a move against the Kurdistan
Workers' Party."
</P>
<P>
"We support Turkey's aim of maintaining her own territorial
integrity and protecting her legitimate security interests. We are
urging the Turks not to exceed measures necessary to protect these
interests," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Britain understand that "Turkey has no wish to
challenge Iraq's territorial integrity and we do not believe the
problem can be solved by military means alone."
</P>
<P>
"We are also stressing to the Turks the importance of
respecting human rights and of avoiding actions which might
endanger innocent civilians in the region," he added.
</P>
<P>
It was reported the border areas of northern Iraq have been the
scene of fighting between Turkish security forces and Kurdish
armed forces before and some 22,000 people have been killed over
the past 12 years.

<HEADLINE> Safety Authority Unveils Eurotunnel Fire Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The Anglo-French Channel Tunnel
Safety Authority Tuesday unveiled its highly critical report on
last November's Channel tunnel fire and ordered the operator
Eurotunnel to tighten up its safety procedures.
</P>
<P>
It said last year's fire "exposed fundamental weaknesses" in
Eurotunnel's safety management and made 36 recommendations for
improving safety in the tunnel.
</P>
<P>
However, the authority did not call for any changes in the
much-criticized semi-open design of the freight shuttle wagons
involved in the fire.
</P>
<P>
Eurotunnel has restricted its services and has shut down its
freight services altogether since November 18 last year when a big
fire broke out, which threatened the lives of three crew and 31
passengers and created tens of millions of pounds of damage.
</P>
<P>
The authority said that it must be satisfied that Eurotunnel
could rectify the faults before commercial service could resume at
its former level.
</P>
<P>
"Eurotunnel must, in particular, convince the Safety Authority
that it is possible to ensure the safe evacuation of passengers in
all circumstances," the authority added.
</P>
<P>
The go-ahead for resuming the freight shuttle service will
depend on the approval of the Anglo-French Intergovernmental
Commission which oversees the tunnel.

<HEADLINE> France Welcomes Russia-NATO Partnership Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 14 (Xinhua) - France today hailed the deal between
Russia and NATO on forging a peaceful new relationship, describing
it as a "historical event".
</P>
<P>
"If this is confirmed, it would be a historic event because it
is an essential event in the definition of the new architecture of
European security, " Foreign Ministry spokesman Jacques
Rummelhardt said.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking hours after a deal was reached in Moscow aimed
at placating Russia before the NATO western alliance invites new
members from former Soviet bloc countries in eastern Europe, a
move Russia has strongly opposed.
</P>
<P>
The pact, if approved by NATO governments and Russian President
Boris Yeltsin, will govern bilateral relations between the two
former Cold War foes after NATO's eastward expansion.
</P>
<P>
Russia has been bitterly opposed to the alliance's plans to
accept former Soviet bloc countries. The Czech Republic, Poland
and Hungary are expected to be invited to join the alliance this
summer.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was announced in Moscow today after two days of
tough negotiations between NATO Secretary General Javier Solana
and Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov. The two sides are
expected to sign the deal on May 27.
</P>
<P>
Rummelhardt said the agreement had been reached thanks to the
efforts of all the countries involved, particularly France and
Germany.
</P>
<P>
The accord has been under negotiation since January when French
President Jacques Chirac travelled to Moscow for talks with
Russian President Boris Yeltsin over the issue, he said.
</P>
<P>
Details of the agreement between Solana and Primakov were not
immediately released.

<HEADLINE> Labor Party Recognizes Palestinians' Right to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 14 (Xinhua) -- In an important move, Israel's
opposition Labor party decided today to include its recognition
of the Palestinians' right to self-determination into its
platform.
</P>
<P>
The decision was adopted with an overwhelming majority at
the Labor convention held at the Tel Aviv headquarters. Moreover,
the leftist party did not rule out the possibility of
establishing a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
But the party imposed some restrictions to the Palestinian
state, which should have no army and forge no alliance with
other countries, and Israel should retain full access to its
airspace.
</P>
<P>
The Labor's decision immediately came under harsh criticism
from the ruling rightist Likud party, which accused it of being
ready to hand over everything to the Palestinians. The Likud
also slammed the Labor for deserting its own principles by not
standing up to the Arab pressure.
</P>
<P>
Today's Labor convention opened following the one held
Tuesday night that rejected the bid by its current chairman Shimon
Peres to be appointed as party president. The objection was seen
as a victory for Ehud Barak, frontrunner for the Labor
leadership contest in the upcoming June 3 party elections.
</P>
<P>
It also signaled the end of the era of Peres, a veteran
politician and a leading architect of the Israeli-Arab peace
process. The countdown to Peres' era began a year ago when he
was defeated by Likud challenger Binyamin Netanyahu in last
May's general elections. Following the defeat, Peres announced
not to rerun for the leadership in the June elections.
</P>
<P>
Bidding to be appointed the party president, a newly
envisioned post by Peres' supporters, Peres hoped to continue
his active role within the party in order to finish his
unfulfilled task of realizing a comprehensive Israeli-Arab
peace.
</P>
<P>
At today's meeting, Barak, widely perceived as a hawk,
withdrew his earlier opposition to the acceptance of a
Palestinian state. He apparently tried to avoid further splitting
the party by making a concession to the dovish camp following
his victory in the Tuesday showdown with Peres.
</P>
<P>
Labor lawmaker Moshe Shahal, former public security minister,
hailed today's decision as a realistic and important move. He
said that "it's a change of attitude of a major Zionist party
in this country. And I think, more than anything else, this
decision is a realistic one."
</P>
<P>
Shahal refuted the claim that the latest move could further
erode Labor's image among the public, which threw it out of
power last May because of its soft stand toward the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
He said such image was not right, and the Labor would do its
utmost to amend it. He justified the Labor's move to accept a
Palestinian state, saying even Netanyahu was talking about the
possibility of recognizing a Palestinian state with restricted
powers.
</P>
<P>
After the Barak-Peres showdown and today's party convention,
the Labor party is ready for the June 3 elections. In the wake
of last year's election defeat, the party has apparently
reorganized itself for a new role in the nation, which Barak has
defined as bringing down the Netanyahu government within one
year.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Farouk Kaddoumy, chairman of the PLO
Political Department, today lashed out at the Israeli government
for disrupting the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Kaddoumy, who arrived here today on a several-day visit to
Egypt, will have talks with Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
on the possibility of resuming the Palestinian-Israeli
negotiations, which was deadlocked again in March when Israel
broke ground for a new Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem,
captured by the Jewish state in 1967.
</P>
<P>
Upon arrival, Kaddoumy warned in a statement that Israel's
practices are "closing all doors of hopes," and threatening to
bring the region back to a whirlpool of violence.
</P>
<P>
"Israel does not really want peace," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"It was apparent, before and after the Oslo agreement, that
Israel did not wish to abide by the signed agreements and
categorically refused to hand over power to the Palestinians,"
said the PLO official.
</P>
<P>
"All that Israel wants is to give the Palestinians some powers
in the final phase and does not want to withdraw from the
occupied Arab territories," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian National Authority (PNA) has rejected a
proposal by Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu to speed up
the final talks on permanent peace for fear that Israel is
trying to avoid fulfilling its obligations in the interim
accords.
</P>
<P>
While the PNA conditioned the resumption of talks on freezing
Jewish settlement buildings, Israel insists on the Palestinian
cooperation in security.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Faisal al-Husseini, PNA minister for Jerusalem
affairs, said Israel must halt all measures to Judaize the holy
city before the peace talks can resume.
</P>
<P>
"Restoration of the negotiations hinges on stopping Israeli
settlement activities in Jerusalem," said Husseini, who is here
to attend an international conference on the Jerusalem issue
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"This settlement policy runs contrary to the
Palestinian-Israeli signed agreements and the international
legitimacy resolutions, he told an Egyptian TV.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to rebuild confidence between both sides,
U.S. Mideast peace envoy Dennis Ross today met with top
Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat to pave way for the first
meeting between the Palestinians and Israelis in two months of
peace crisis.
</P>
<P>
No progress has been made since Ross renewed his shuttle
diplomacy to the region last week, the second in a month.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Launches Cross-border Military Operations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish security forces
launched cross-border military operations against members of the
outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), who are based in northern
Iraq, the Anatolia News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The semi-official agency said that the security forces entered
northern Iraq early this morning and surrounded a large group of
PKK militants who shelter themselves in the regions of Sivi and
Dutaza.
</P>
<P>
The traffic to Habur Border Gate between Turkey and northern
Iraq was closed Tuesday night for the cross-border operations,
said the report.
</P>
<P>
Sermet Atacanli, deputy spokesman of the Turkish Foreign
Ministry told reporters today that "the Turkish troops provided
air and artillery support," following a call for aid by Iraq's
Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) Chairman Mesud Barzani. "And some
of our troops entered the region (northern Iraq) from Habur-Zaho
direction," he added.
</P>
<P>
Atacanli underlined that Turkey launched the operations with
limited forces, saying that necessary security measures had been
taken in order to prevent possible incursions from the
Turkish-Iraqi border.
</P>
<P>
"Our troops in the region may interfere in the clashes
between Barzani and the PKK when it is necessary," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Turkish private Show TV reported this evening that
about 50,000-strong Turkish troops had crossed the border into
northern Iraq in a bid to wipe out the PKK rebels whose
headquarters are in the area.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Turkish security forces today killed 30 PKK
militants and captured 32 others in Sirnak province, Eruh town
of Siirt province and Bitlis province, according to a statement
issued by the office of the Emergency Regional Rule.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that six PKK rebels surrendered to the
security forces in different provinces in the region.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting for autonomy in a nearly 13-year-old
separatist war, which has claimed over 21,000 lives in easter
and southeastern Turkey.

NEW YORK, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The United Airlines of the United
States will join hands with four other overseas carriers with a
view to stitching their operations and marketing efforts,
according to a report of the New York Times today.
</P>
<P>
The cooperation agreement, which is expected to be announced
Wednesday, includes Lufthansa, Air Canada, Thai Airways
International and Scandinavian Airlines System. The agreement will
require all the partners to share ticket offices and airport
operations, as well as jointly purchase supplies.
</P>
<P>
Although alliances between airlines are hardly new, the
agreement by the five carriers represents a new level of
cooperation and coordination. Industry experts predicted that ten
such groupings of airlines is likely to dominate the business in
10 or 15 years.
</P>
<P>
While the member airlines will maintain their current separate
identities, they will share a new logo and the theme line "The
Airline Network for Earth" to help market the alliance, called
Star Alliance.
</P>
<P>
By combining route networks, they can offer seamless service
between far-flung destination, experts said.

MALE, the Maldives, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The South Asian
Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) today ended its first
summit after celebrating the 10th anniversary of its founding in
1995, determined to accelerate regional cooperation and implement
result-oriented plans.
</P>
<P>
Launched into business 11 and a half years ago with the
objectives of boosting economic development and eradicating
poverty in the region in a fast changing world, SAARC has now
become more business-like.
</P>
<P>
"A 10-year-old child is becoming a little more mature," Naeem
Hasan, secretary-general of SAARC, told Xinhua in an interview
before the three-day summit began on May 12.
</P>
<P>
"The trend in SAARC now is for a more action-oriented program.
In the first 10 years of SAARC's existence, we were talking in
general terms and now we are going into specific areas, specific
activities," Hasan said.
</P>
<P>
At the Male summit, the SAARC leaders came up with a more
ambitious plan, for creating a free trade zone -- the South Asian
Free Trade Area (SAFTA) -- by the year 2001, four years ahead of a
previous deadline.
</P>
<P>
At their last summit in New Delhi two years ago, they decided
to establish such a zone preferably by 2000 and not later than
2005. SAARC launched the South Asian Preferential Trading
Arrangement (SAPTA) in December 1995, marking its first step
toward the creation of a free trade zone.
</P>
<P>
SAARC leaders insist that 2001 is a "realistic target year."
This may reveal some measure of urgency or even confidence in
their eagerness to catch up with other regional groupings such as
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.
</P>
<P>
SAARC leaders "resolved to accelerate regional cooperation in
order to realize the aims and objectives of the association," said
a declaration issued at the end of the summit.
</P>
<P>
Fully aware of its huge human resources and determined to wipe
out the scourge of poverty which is standing in the way of
development in the region of 1.2 billion people, the leaders
regard regional cooperation as "indispensable in an interdependent
world for the realization of the full potential of the South Asian
region."
</P>
<P>
SAARC was formed in December 1985 by seven countries --
Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri
Lanka -- with the main aim of promoting economic growth, social
progress and cultural development through joint action in agreed
areas of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"Over the past decade SAARC has matured as an institution and
the scope and volume of cooperative activities have expanded," the
declaration said.
</P>
<P>
"In addition to continued cooperation in agreed areas, SAARC
has now moved into the core areas of economic cooperation," it
stressed.
</P>
<P>
The SAARC leaders not only made the landmark decision to move
faster toward trade liberalization in the region by advancing the
deadline for the realization of the free trade zone. They also
decided to set up a group composed of eminent persons to conduct a
comprehensive review of SAARC after nearly 12 years of its
existence and identify measures to "further vitalize and enhance
the effectiveness of the association in achieving its objectives."
</P>
<P>
The leaders also agreed to enhance political cooperation. "The
aims of promoting peace, stability and amity and accelerated
socio-economic cooperation may be achieved by fostering
good-neighborly relations, relieving tensions and building
confidence...," they said. "A process of informal political
consultations would prove useful in this regard."
</P>
<P>
They reiterated their commitment to eradicating poverty in the
region by the year 2002 preferably and called for social
mobilization as part of this endeavor.
</P>
<P>
They also voiced deep concern over the plight of women and
children in the poverty-ridden region and adopted specific
measures to cope with the worsening environment.
</P>
<P>
Nobody can underestimate the potential of such a new-born force
which is increasingly attracting world attention, some observers
here said.

<HEADLINE> 50th World Health Assembly Closes with Budget Adopted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The 50th World Health Assembly
closed here today with the adoption of a working program budget of
842.7 million U.S. dollars for 1998-1999.
</P>
<P>
The budget for 1998-1999 consists of six appropriation
sections: governing bodies, health policy and management, health
services development, promotion and protection of health,
integrated control of diseases and administrative services.
</P>
<P>
The World Health Assembly, highest governing body of the World
Health Organization (WHO), also adopted a budget-related
resolution. It requests the WHO director-general to present to the
101st session of the Executive Board in January 1998 an efficiency
plan that will enable WHO to save up to three percent from
administrative costs and overheads. The savings will then go to
priority health problems to which representatives of 191 WHO
members have agreed that a maximum amount of funds should be
allocated.
</P>
<P>
Representatives will gather again in Geneva in May next year
for a milestone session in the history of WHO. High on the agenda
are WHO's 50th anniversary, adoption of the global health policy
for the 21st century, and election of a director-general. Current
Director-General Dr Hiroshi Nakajima has announced that he will
not seek a third term when his second five-year tenure expires in

<HEADLINE> WHA: Replication of Human Individuals Ethically </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The 50th World health Assembly has
adopted a resolution affirming that the use of cloning for the
replication of human individuals is ethically unacceptable and
contrary to human integrity and morality.
</P>
<P>
Before adopting the resolution, the assembly, highest governing
body of the World Health Organization (WHO), has considered the
report of the WHO director-general on human cloning, biomedical
technology and WHO's role in standard-setting, as well as the
statements made by representatives of WHO members, according to a
WHO press release issued today.
</P>
<P>
In this resolution, the delegates recognize the need to respect
the freedom of ethically acceptable scientific activity and to
ensure access to the benefits of its applications. However, they
also recognize that developments in cloning and other genetic
procedures have unprecedented ethical implications and that
related research and development should therefore be carefully
monitored and assessed, and the rights and dignity of patients
respected.
</P>
<P>
The resolution requests the WHO director-general to take the
lead in clarifying and assessing the ethical, social, and
scientific implications of cloning in the area of human health, in
consultation with other international organizations, national
governments and professional and scientific bodies; and, with the
relevant international bodies, to consider related legal aspects.
The director-general is also requested to inform the members in
order to foster a public debate on these issues, and to report to
the Executive Board at its January 1998 session, and to the next
World Health Assembly in May 1998, on the outcome of the
assessments.
</P>
<P>
After the announcement of the successful cloning of an adult
sheep in March 1997, WHO Director-General Dr Hiroshi Nakajima had
condemned human cloning, emphasizing that "It would violate some
of the basic principles which govern medically assisted
procreation, including respect for the dignity of the human being
and protection of the security of human genetic material".

<HEADLINE> Iraq Denounces Turkish Military Invasion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Iraq today strongly denounced a
fresh Turkish military invasion of northern Iraq, demanding an
immediate withdrawal of Turkish troops, the Iraqi news agency
(INA) reported.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to the INA, an Iraqi foreign ministry spokesman
said that some Turkish troops invaded northern Iraq at 3:00 local
time Tuesday (23:00 GMT Monday).
</P>
<P>
The spokesman stressed that the invasion violates the Iraqi
sovereignty and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
He described such an act as contradictory to the U.N. charter
and principles of international laws as well as good neighborly
relations between Iraq and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The unidentified spokesman added that the Turkish intrusion
also ran counter with what Turkey talks about its commitment to
standards of good neighborliness. Iraq utterly rejects all the
pretexts given by Turkey to justify its invasion, he added.
</P>
<P>
Chasing Kurdish rebels does not authorize Turkey to encroach
upon the Iraqi territory and sovereignty, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He strongly demanded "an immediate and complete withdrawal" of
all the invading Turkish troops from the Iraqi territory.
</P>
<P>
He elaborated that two Turkish armored units supported by
helicopters intruded the Iraqi territory. One headed for the area
of Zakho while the other made its way to an area around
Amadiya. Both Zakho and Amadiya are border cities in the
northwest of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The INA quoted the spokesman as saying that the Turkish
invasion resulted in heavy losses of life and property of
Iraqi Kurds. No details were reported.

<HEADLINE> Angolan-French Trade Relations to Be Strengthened </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan-French trade
relations will be strengthened in the second half of this year,
Commercial Counsellor Eric Noitakis in the French Embassy here
said today.
</P>
<P>
An Angolan-French industrial and commercial association will
be set up late this year, Noitakis told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He added that two French delegations of intrepreneurs will
visit Angola this year.
</P>
<P>
According to him, a 15-member oil intrepreneur delegation will
probe the possibilities for more investment in Angola and a
building industry delegation during its visit will express its
readiness to help Angola rehabilitate its infrastructure
destroyed during the war years.
</P>
<P>
He said France will invest 50 million US dollars in the
construction of a giant hotel in Luanda. The project will start
late this year.
</P>
<P>
France will build a shipyard in the central coastal city of
Lobito, Noitakis said. enditem

<HEADLINE> European Shares Mixed, Paris Hits New Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Europe's major stock markets ended
mixed Wednesday, with the recent record-breaking rallies in both
London and Frankfurt losing momentum while Paris surging sharply
and hitting a new record closing high.
</P>
<P>
After an unprecedented 8-consecutive-session run of record
closing highs, British shares on the London market finally calmed
down and ended slightly lower for the first time in the past 12
session since the May 1 general election.
</P>
<P>
Traders said that share prices recovered from session lows as
Wall Street responded to US interest rate optimism after a subdued
set of US producer prices figures made a near-term interest rate
rise less likely.
</P>
<P>
The FTSE 100 index finished 4.1 points lower at 4,686.9.
</P>
<P>
German shares in Frankfurt also ended their recent rally and
finished weaker as a continuing poor performance from Deutsche
Telekom weighed heavily on market sentiment. The DAX-30 share
index closed the session down 21.46 points, or 0.6 percent, at
3,573.69.
</P>
<P>
However, in Paris, French shares hit record highs on the back
of Dow movements and hopes that the ruling center-right coalition
will win power again which removed uncertainty about the oncoming
elections, with the CAC-40 index ending 55.05 points higher at
2,774.63.
</P>
<P>
London's FTSE 100 index ended down 4.1 points at 4,686.9. The
Frankfurt DAX-30 index finished 21.46 points lower at 3,573.69.

<P>
BRUSSELS, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission, the
European Union's executive body, said on Wednesday that it had
cleared the pound 12 billion planned merger between British
Telecom and the MCI Communications Corporation of the United
States.
</P>
<P>
The Commission said that the proposed merger would have created
or reinforced a dominant position in the markets for international
voice telephony service on the UK-US route and for
audio-conferencing services in the UK.
</P>
<P>
"However, the Commission has considered that the undertakings
proposed by the parties during the proceedings are sufficient to
address the competition concerns... and compatible with EU's
common market," it was stated in a Commission statement.
</P>
<P>
This merger deal will create the wourld's fourth largest
telephone company and is one of the biggest in UK corporate
history. But the merger still has to be cleared by American
regulators.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Welcomes Turkish Announcement on War Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus has welcomed Turkish Prime
Minister Mecmetin Erbakan's announcement of the postponement of the
joint U.S.-Israel-Turkey military manoeuvres.
</P>
<P>
"This is the right decision if one takes into account the
climate which we would like to create and similar gestures
made by other parties," Government Spokesman Manolis Christofides
told reporters at his daily press briefing today.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan told reporters Tuesday that "the maneuvers are
postponed to coming years." But the Turkish military denied that
and there is no official confirmation from the Israeli or the
U.S. side.
</P>
<P>
The plan for the joint exercises was reported last week and
rejected by the Cypriot government, which called on the U.S. and
Israel to abide by international law.
</P>
<P>
A number of countries have voiced their concern over Turkey's
warming relations with Israel, saying the planned war games pose

<HEADLINE> UK's Queen Outlines Legislative Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Britain's head of state Elizabeth
announced a legislative program today which includes 26 bills that
the government hopes to enact over the next 18 months.
</P>
<P>
The package of bills covers a wide range of issues, with the
five major commitments of Labor Party in its election manifesto as
the centerpiece -- education, national health service, swifter
punishment of young offenders, more employment for young people
and better life for the whole country.
</P>
<P>
In her speech at an ages-old ceremony in the upper House of
Lords, Elizabeth said the education of young people was the
government's first priority.
</P>
<P>
The government "will work to raise standards in schools,
colleges and universities and to promote lifelong learning at the
workplace," she said.
</P>
<P>
In one of the two education bills, the government said to cut
class sizes by using money saved as a result of legislation
phasing out the assisted places scheme.
</P>
<P>
The other aims to raise school standards, develop a new role
for the local education authorities and parents and propose
reforms to the teaching profession.
</P>
<P>
On economy, Elizabeth said the central objectives "are high and
stable levels of economic growth and employment, to be achieved by
ensuring opportunity for all.
</P>
<P>
To that end, the government will introduce a bill to give the
Bank of England operational responsibility for setting interest
rates, in order to deliver price stability and support the
government's overall economic policy.
</P>
<P>
The government also pledged to build a new partnership with
business to "build a modern and dynamic economy to improve the
competitiveness" of Britain's industry.
</P>
<P>
As promised in the election campaign, the new Labor government
will mount a fundamental attack upon youth and long-term
unemployment and will take early steps to bring 250,000 young
people into work, financed by a levy on the excess profits of the
privatized utilities which will be brought forward in an early
budget.
</P>
<P>
On the Northern Ireland issue, Elizabeth said the new
government will "seek reconciliation and a political settlement
which has broad support, working in cooperation with the Irish
government."
</P>
<P>
On relationship with the European Union, the new government has
shifted the old passive stance and vowed to take a leading role.
</P>
<P>
"They will seek to promote employment, improve competitiveness,
complete the Single Market and opt into the Social Chapter," the
Queen said, adding the government will also work for the early and
successful enlargement of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
On the upcoming transfer of Hong Kong to China on June 30, the
Queen said her government will work to achieve a successful
transition.
</P>
<P>
The Queen's speech signals the formal opening of the parliament
elected on May 1. The Labor Party, after 18 years in opposition,
won 419 seats in the 659-seat lower house and came to power with
its leader Tony Blair as Britain's new prime minister.

<HEADLINE> ''Critical'' Agenda Prepared for OAU Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 14 (Xinhua) -- A critical agenda to review the
past and chart the course for Africa's future politics and
economics has been prepared for the 33rd Organisation of African
Unity (OAU) summit to be held here next month.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a news conference today, Zimbabwean Foreign
Minister Stan Mudenge said the three-day assembly of African
heads of state and government starting on June 2 would discuss a
wide range of issues covering politics, economics and health.
</P>
<P>
He said, ''Pan-Africanism has triumphed, we have triumphed on
the political front and now we are on the economic war front.''
</P>
<P>
He added, ''all this takes place against political
developments of the Great Lakes, which will preoccupy the heads
and we will look at Liberia, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Burundi, the
peace process in Angola, the Middle East and the disagreement
between Libya, France, Britain and America.''
</P>
<P>
The summit will look at the Lome Convention in light of the
green paper that has been prepared by the European Union on the
state of relations and trade with African, Carribean and Pacific
countries after the year 2000 when the convention expires.
</P>
<P>
''The World Health Organisation (WHO) is proposing the
adoption of a declaration to fight malaria,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Malaria has reemerged as a fatal disease as a strain resistant
to most first line drugs is being experienced by many countries.
''We look forward to a busy time,'' the minister said. enditem

<HEADLINE> African Ministers to Discuss Trade in Ghana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 14 (Xinhua) -- African ministers of industry meet in
Ghana on May 26-28 to discuss new approaches to ensure that
industries on the continent participate in the globalisation process.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference in Harare today, United Nations
Industrial Development Organisation (UNIDO) Country Director for
Botswana, Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe Niels Biering said the meeting
comes amid concern that there was need for new approaches from both
African governments and the international community to ensure that no
past policy failures were repeated.
</P>
<P>
About 35 to 40 ministers of industries or their deputies are
expected to attend the conference, organised by the UNIDO in
collaboration with the Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) and
the Organisation of African Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
Biering mentioned the prolonged protection of local industries and
the misguided donor belief that aid alone could lead to significant
economic transformation, particularly in Africa, reportedly to be the
world's poorest continent.
</P>
<P>
He said the cushion of aid had resulted in African governments not
taking full responsibility for their own development goals.
</P>
<P>
The pivotal role of the private sector was not given full reign to
develop, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the investment issue, he said that of the world's total
direct foreign investment flows, only five percent went to africa
and one percent to the 33 African least developed countries.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Under-Secretary General Visits Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 14 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Under-Secretary General for
Political Affairs Kieran Prendergast arrived here today for
meetings with community leaders involved in the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival Prendergast reiterated that
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan will take a firm and final
decision toward the end of May on whether to invite the leaders of
the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities to direct talks.
</P>
<P>
Prendergast said he has "some questions and some ideas" to work
with during his meetings with President Glafcos Clerides and
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the U.N. has been engaged in the process of
intensive dialog with the objective of resuming the intercommunal
talks at the level of head of respective communities.
</P>
<P>
"The Secretary-General will take a final decision on this
after I get back and report to him, but I believe that the
expectation, subject to that decision, is that the talks should
resume by the middle of the year," he said.
</P>
<P>
After his meetings in Cyprus, Prendergast will visit Athens
and Ankara to discuss the Cyprus problem with officials there.
</P>
<P>
Replying to questions, he said talks are unlikely to take place
during next month's U.N. conference on the environment, which
Cypriot President Clerides will attend, because Annan would be too
preoccupied with conference proceedings and senior statesmen in
New York.
</P>
<P>
"He wants to start the talks and chair them at the beginning
and be available during them," the U.N. official added.
</P>
<P>
Prendergast will meet Clerides Thursday, and then he will go to
the Turkish-controlled northern part of Nicosia to have a meeting
with Denktash.
</P>
<P>
Prendergast's visit came at a time when the U.N.-led proximity
talks have entered the third month, during which the U.N. Resident
Representative Gustave Feissel had separate meetings with
Clerides and Denktash to prepare the ground for the face-to-face
negotiations between the two communities on the island.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus problem has remained unsolved since 1974 when
the island was divided after the Turkish troops took control
of its northern third in the wake of a short-lived coup
seeking union with Greece.

<HEADLINE> Norwegian FM Calls for Halt of Har Homa Building </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The visiting Norwegian Foreign
Minister, Bjorn Godal, today called on Israel to freeze the
construction of the new Jewish settlement at Har Homa in East
Jerusalem, reported the state-run Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
Godal, who is now on a Middle East peace mission, issued the
call when he was speaking to reporters after meeting with his
Israeli counterpart David Levy. He said: "The problem is more
important than other issues and it rests with Israel. I have a
firm opinion on that."
</P>
<P>
The Norwegian minister said that Norway has been critical of
Israel's settlement policy because it is a very sensitive
area. He added that it is true that the settlement policy cannot
be read as contrary to the wording of the Oslo Accords, but it
can easily been seen by the Palestinian side as anticipating the
stalemate of the negotiations and that is why it creates a
climate with difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Godal, who came here after talks in Egypt, Jordan and Syria,
indicated that he did not bring with him any specific proposals,
but only wanted to help create a favorable atmosphere for the
resumption of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Levy responded by asking how long the freeze of the Har Homa
construction would be expected to last. He said that if Israel
knew the specific timeframe, it would know what proposals to
consider.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on tonight's meeting between senior Israeli and
Palestinian officials in the presence of the U.S. Middle East
peace coordinator Dennis Ross at the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv,
Levy expressed hope that the objective is not just to hold one

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Urges Donors to Quicken Food Aid to DPRK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Children's Fund
(UNICEF) today urged international donors to quicken their food
aid to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).
</P>
<P>
A UNICEF team, on its recent mission to Kangwon Province in the
southeast of the DPRK, found severe malnorishment among children
at nurseries, kindergartens, hospitals and at home.
</P>
<P>
The 40,000 plus kindergartens and nurseries in the DPRK have
been "running on empty" for months now, with little or no food,
Anthony Hewett, the mission chief, said at a press conference here
today. He complained that response from donors has been weak and
food aid is arriving far too slowly since UN agencies launched an
appeal to raise funds for aid to the DPRK in April.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF estimates that because of lack of food as few as 30 to
50 percent of children are attending nurseries or kindergartens,
where they would have been fed. The first priority is to pump
enough food into the system to get children back to nurseries,
kindergartens, and, where necessary, into hospitals, said Mr
Hewett, representative at UNICEF area office in Bangkok, Thailand.
</P>
<P>
As an immediate step, UNICEF plans to fly in a shipment of high
energy milk for malnourished children in Kangwon, and to begin
training hospital staff in therapeutic feeding techniques and
malnutrition-related health problems.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF warns that, until these institutions are back in full
operation, children's conditions will go worse. Flood damage and
the resulting destruction of industrial and social structures is
forcing the most vulnerable groups into "potentially lethal
nutritional decline", according to Hewett.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF is hoping for a stronger response from donors to the
crisis and meanwhile will continue to work in collaboration wi the
World Food Program (WFP), to help maintain the food supply to
nurseries, kindergartens and hospitals. It will also be supplying
antibiotics and hospital equipment in order to treat
hunger-related diseases.

<HEADLINE> Waigel Confirms Intention to Sell Part of Deutsche </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 14 (Xinhua) -- German Finance Minister Theo Waigel
today confirmed the Bonn government's intention to sell off part
of its stake in the newly-privatized German telecom group,
Deutsche Telecom, to raise money to help offset an expected huge
budget shortfall for 1997.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue and step up the privatization," Waigel told
reporters in Bonn. "It is also conceivable that we will move up
the dates of steps in Telecom's privatization."
</P>
<P>
Deutsche Telecom, formerly a subsidiary of the federal post
office, went public six months ago. The government had promised
earlier that it would not dispose of any of the 75 percent Telecom
shares it still holds before the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
But pressure on the government to sell part of its Telecom
stake mounted in the past few days when it became quite clear that
the government would run up a huge financial shortfall for the
current year.
</P>
<P>
Waigel is scheduled to present the official tax estimates on
Thursday. According to speculations, the total government tax
deficits for 1997 could be 15 billion German marks (8.8 billion
U.S. dollars), or even 30 billion (17.6 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Apart from further privatization of Deutsche Telecom, the Bonn
government was also considering to cut spendings and to sell part
of the central bank's gold reserve, German media reported
Wednesday.

HARARE, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's month-on-month inflation
rose from 19.9 percent in March to 22.4 percent in April amid
warning that there will be no let-up to inflation during the rest
of the year.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said today the central bank would not be able to meet
its inflation target of 21 percent by June due to what they said
"very serious" inflationary pressures in the economy.
</P>
<P>
Major threats to inflation included price rises and the
government'a bloated budget deficit, they said.
</P>
<P>
Among other items, food was again the major contributory
factor to high inflation in April, mainly due to high fruit and
vegetable prices as well as transport and medical costs.
</P>
<P>
Inflation is expected to exceed 25 percent by the end of June.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Burundian military
leader Major Pierre Buyoya said here today that he is ready for
peace talks with other warring factions in the country.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview at the Dar es Salaam International
Airport today, Buyoya also admitted that ethnic killings were
still going on in Burundi.
</P>
<P>
Muyoya, who was in Tanzania for a one-day working trip at the
invitation of the Burundi peace facilitator, Mwalimu Julius
Nyerere, said fighting was going on between the army and other
factions, especially in southern part of the country.
</P>
<P>
He said Burundians were perfectly satisfied with Nyerere's
role as the peace facilitator, ruling out reports that there were
covert plans to kill the former Tanzanian president on grounds
that he was impeding peace in Burundi.
</P>
<P>
During the two-hour talks with Nyerere at the latter's Msasani
residence, Buyoya also sought clarification on the common list of
items which qualify to enter Burundi under the April decision to
ease trade sanctions imposed by African countries on Burundi.
</P>
<P>
Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda and Zaire slapped a trade
embargo on Burundi's military government last year, opposing a

<HEADLINE> Fourth Round of Northern Iraq Peace Talks Starts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The fourth round of northern Iraq
peace talks started here today to discuss measures for bringing
peace and stability to the region, the semi-official Anatolia News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of three rival parties, namely the Patriotic
Union of Kurdistan (PUK), the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) as
well as the Turkmen Front, and officials from the United States,
Britain and Turkey attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press before the talks, Turkish Foreign
Ministry Undersecretary Onur Oymen, head of the Turkish
delegation, said that the ceasefire provided in the region was a
success of the Ankara process.
</P>
<P>
The mechanism created to monitor the ceasefire was also
working well thanks to the efforts of all parties concerned,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources close to the talks were quoted as saying
that the fourth round of peace talks was a continuation of the
Ankara process, jointly sponsored by the U.S., Britain and
Turkey, but no concrete result could be expected.
</P>
<P>
The meeting came as the Turkish security troops launched a
massive cross-border military operation in pursuit of the outlawed
Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) early this morning.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement reached by the KDP and PUK in the third
round of peace talks last February, the Peace Monitoring Force
(PMF) began its mission in northern Iraq late last month to
supervise the truce between the two rival Kurdish parties in the
region.
</P>
<P>
A glimmer of hope was once expected when the PUK and KDP signed
a peace accord on October 31, 1996 under the mediation of the
U.S., Britain and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
However, The KDP's pullout from the peace talks cast a shadow
on the Ankara process after a high-ranking KDP official was
assassinated in northern Iraq in mid-March by alleged PUK
militants.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, supporting Iraq's Turkmen minority because of ethnic
and cultural bonds, wants the Turkmen to have a say in the
administration of the region.
</P>
<P>
The KDP, backed by the Iraqi government troops, fought
against the pro-Iran PUK and got the upper hand in late
August last year, leading to a U.S. air strike against the
Iraqi military targets.
</P>
<P>
The northern part of Iraq has been occupied by the two
Kurdish groups since the Gulf War in 1991, but it split into
rival zones after the KDP and PUK began fighting each in
1994.

<P>
"Where they all agree, they will act jointly, as they are doing

</P>

The 16 NATO members and Russia are expected to sign the

The Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland are most likely to be

Russia has been opposing the expansion, insisting that it will
create new divide in Europe and threaten its security. Hence,
Russia asks NATO to guarantee that there will be no military
installations nor nuclear weapons in the new member states.
</P>

Clinton said that there is an "explicit understanding" in the

requirements of membership can be met by any new members," he

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Confirms Russia Fires Laser at Canadian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 14 (Xinhua) -- A Russian cargo ship last month
fired a laser beam at a Canadian helicopter, injuring its pilot
and a U.S. Navy officer, the Pentagon confirmed today.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Times reported today that the incident, which
occurred April 4 near Seattle, prompted a U.S. diplomatic protest
and the ship, Kapitan Man, was detained and searched by U.S.
officials.
</P>
<P>
Confirming the report but denying the lodging of any official
protest, Dick Bridges, a spokesman for the Pentagon, said that the
two men who were injured have recovered.
</P>
<P>
Their injuries were "consistent with damage caused by laser
burn" but the evidence is not conclusive, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The CH-124 helicopter was operating under a joint U.S.-Canadian
naval agreement when it was shot, according The Washington Times.
</P>
<P>
At the time of the incident, the Russian ship was sailing in
U.S. waters through the Strait of Juan De Fuca, north of
Washington's Puget Sound while the U.S. nuclear submarine USS Ohio
was going out the Strait.
</P>
<P>
The Russian ship's crew denied having any lasers aboard, but
the "top secret" Pentagon report said photographs taken by the
injured Navy officer showed a beam of red light being fired from
the ship.
</P>
<P>
The confrontation was "a stark reminder that cat-and-mouse
efforts to monitor strategic nuclear systems have not ended with
the Cold War," the U.S. newspaper reported.

<P>
CAIRO, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The following are business briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- The U.S. embassy in Jordan has declared to sponsor the
fifth annual U.S. product trade fair in Amman in an effort to
boost the U.S.-Jordanian trade exchange.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's exports to the U.S. in the past five years have been
stagnant at around 18 to 20 million U.S. dollars per year, while
the U.S. exported more than 350 million dollars of goods last year
to Jordan, according to sources at the U.S. Embassy here.
</P>
<P>
Trade between the U.S. and Jordan was not at the level that it
could be, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- About 55 million U.S. dollars was spent on 41 new
projects in the first quarter of this year, in comparison with 172
million dollars spent on 103 projects in the same period last
year, said Elias Farraj, assistant director-general at the
Investment Promotion Corp.
</P>
<P>
The decline can be attributed to the political uncertainty and
the figures are expected to increase once the political atmosphere
improves, he said.
</P>
<P>
The 41 projects are in five sectors that enjoy tax and customs
exemptions under an investment promotion law enacted a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The sectors are industry, agriculture, hotels, hospitals and
maritime and railway transportation.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- An international conference will be opened in London
soon to acquaint participants and investors with investment
opportunities in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Industry, Trade and Supply Minister Hani Mulki said that the
conference organized by a Swiss bank aims to familiarize
foreign investors with Jordan's financial and economic policies.
</P>
<P>
Investment is expected to flow into Jordan through the
conference, and in effect can boost the economic reform program,
the privatization process, the price-liberalizing process and the
country's efforts to join the World Trade organization.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The private sector is expected to shoulder nearly 70
percent of the investments in Egypt in the coming five years, the
Egyptian Gazette reported today.
</P>
<P>
Total investments in the country would reach 400 billion
Egyptian pounds (about 117.6 billion U.S. dollars) during the 4th
five-year plan spanning 1997-2002, the paper quoted State Minister
of Planning Zafer al-Beshry as saying.
</P>
<P>
Private investors would provide 279 billion pounds (82 billion
dollars), he said.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics indicate that the private sector has
contributed 60 percent of the total investment in the past five
years, reaching 49.1 billion pounds (14.4 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The minister said the plan would open the door for the private
sectors to invest in the infrastructure field, such as power
stations, roads, airports and seaports, and the construction of
water plants.
</P>
<P>
The development strategy of the plan was mainly aimed at
raising the economic growth rate to an average 6.9 percent, which
would in turn achieve regular and continuous increase in the
national capital, he said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has a population of more than 60 million with
unemployment rate reaching nearly 20 percent, according to a World
Bank report.
</P>
<P>
Investment is vital for creating jobs and Egypt plans to create
500,000-800,000 jobs each year by 2000.

<P>
ATHENS, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Greece confirmed today that the
Committees of Experts formed to review procedural matters relating
to differences between Greece and Turkey would begin operation by
exchanging views in writing.
</P>
<P>
Greek government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said that the
process, with the exchange taking place via the Dutch EU
presidency, would enable each side to clearly set out its
positions.
</P>
<P>
"In this way, it will become clear whether there is common
ground," he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman stressed that Athens was interested in
rapprochement and coming to an understanding with Ankara but only
within the framework of the three conditions set by Greece, namely
that Ankara must respect international law, international treaties
and acts in "a spirit of good faith."
</P>
<P>
The Greek-Turkish relations have been strained for decades over
territorial disputes and the Cyprus issue, but the recent months
have seen a thawing of the ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Athens and Ankara agreed last month to set up Committees of
Experts to examine their problems. Professor Krateros Ioannou and
professor Argyris Fatouros have been appointed by Athens as the
members of the Greek committee of experts while diplomat Sukru
Elegtag and jurist Suat Bilge will be the representatives of the
Turkish side.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the Committees of Experts will prepare a
joint report by mid-june on processes proposed to resolve
Greek-Turkish problems.

on the subject, which was the Labor government's first such paper
for 22 years.
</P>
<P>
This would make clear the new government's determination to
avoid incidents, such as the row over aid to Malaysia's Pergaus
Dam, which embarrassed the outgoing Conservative government.
</P>
<P>
"There will be no more Pergaus. Our intention is to focus
ruthlessly on poverty -- getting all children into education and
providing clean water and primary health care for all," she said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Short said her presence in the cabinet was "a statement of
intent that the government will put world development at the heart
of its work," and she intended to make a permanent difference with
the former Conservative government.

<HEADLINE> Arab Parliamentarians Call for Peace, Solidarity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Leading Arab lawmakers today ended
their two-day meeting with a call to safeguard the Mideast peace
process and fortify Arab solidarity.
</P>
<P>
A communique, issued at the end of the 7th Arab Parliamentary
Union Conference this evening, stressed the Arab resolve to
realize a just and comprehensive peace, based on Israel's full
withdrawal from all occupied Arab territories.
</P>
<P>
The final communique asked Israel to make an unequivocal
commitment to completing the peace process on the basis of the
land-for-peace principle and relevant U.N. Security Council
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
"Arab countries should freeze normalization with Israel until
it works for achieving a just and comprehensive peace," it said.
</P>
<P>
The document also recommended suspending Arab participation in
multilateral talks and "giving teeth to a first-degree Arab
boycott of Israel" until a just and comprehensive peace becomes a
reality.
</P>
<P>
The Mideast peace talks were plunged into a deadlock since
Israel broke ground in March for a new Jewish settlement in Arab
East Jerusalem, where Palestinians want as their future capital.
</P>
<P>
Parliamentary leaders from 18 Arab countries, emerging from
their final meeting at the Arab League headquarters here, also
stressed the importance of closing Arab ranks and establishing a
common market.
</P>
<P>
"Solidarity represents the general framework for cooperation
among Arab countries," said the parliamentarians, urging Arab
unity in face of the challenges posed by international changes
and developments.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the communique said the achievement of economic
integrity through a common Arab market will help meet these
challenges.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the political role of the Arab Parliamentary Union
in setting up the Arab market, the communique said a
parliamentary committee composed of Egypt, Morocco, Syria,
Lebanon and Kuwait will follow up the implementation.
</P>
<P>
The conference also called for convening an Arab summit on a
regular basis with the purpose of drawing up a joint Arab policy
and solving inter-Arab differences within the framework of the
Arab League.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian King Warns Against Permanent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, May 14 (Xinhua) -- King Hussein of Jordan said here
today Jordan will not be a substitute homeland for Palestinian
refugees and will not tolerate any attempt to undermine Jordan's
national unity.
</P>
<P>
He was rejecting the saying about a 700-million-U.S. dollar
plan designed by some American Jews, under which a large number of
Palestinian refugees will be permanently settled in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian king made the remarks when speaking to army
officers at the Hussein Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
Press reports here have said under the plan, each Palestinian
household to be settled in Jordan will get 30 thousand dollars.
</P>
<P>
Jordan remains a strong supporter of the Palestinians in their
demand for the restoration of their rights on their own national
soil and there is no alternative to the Palestinians' choice, said
Hussein.
</P>
<P>
The Central Intelligence Agency of the U.S. and the Israeli
intelligence bureau have noted that the money for the Palestinian
settlement plan comes from some Swiss banks, where the Jews have
deposited a big amount of money, published rumors said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the Swiss government is ambiguous about
the plan but has not denied it.
</P>
<P>
Some 1 million Palestinians became homeless during the first
Middle East war in 1948 when Israel annexed part of the
Palestinian land. They are now in refugee camps in Jordan, Syria,
Lebanon and the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
At present, Palestinians including the refugees comprise about
60 percent of Jordan's 4 million-strong population.

WASHINGTON, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Russian Defense Minister Igor
Rodionov today praised the accord reached between his country and
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) earlier today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters at the Pentagon, Rodionov suggested that

In Moscow, Russian President Boris Yeltsin said that the deal
would be binding on NATO and that it would give Moscow the means
to block any decision by NATO it did not approve of.
</P>
<P>
The agreement has opened the way to the signing of a document

CAIRO, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Saadoun Hammadi, speaker of the Iraqi
National Assembly, made a vehement objection against what is
written on Iraq in the final communique of the 7th Conference of
the Arab Parliamentary Union (APU).
</P>
<P>
Hammadi, who leads his country's delegation to the conference,
rejected the implied accusation that Iraq has not fully fulfilled
its commitment to the U.N. resolutions on Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
"Iraq had recognized Kuwait and its international borders
according to resolution 833 and has sent back all Kuwaiti
property and paid the necessary compensations besides returning
the Kuwaiti and other nationalities' captives," he said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq is further cooperating with the Red Cross on the fate of
the missing, the Iraqi speaker added, clarifying that by doing all
this, Iraq has already honored all the international resolutions
on it.
</P>
<P>
Leading Arab lawmakers, winding up their two-day meeting here
today, while advocating the unity of Iraq, stressed that Iraq
should implement all U.N. Security Council resolutions so as to
expedite the lifting of the embargo imposed on it for its 1990
invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been urging Arab countries to give a helping hand in
lifting the U.N.-imposed six-year sanctions as early as this
year.

<HEADLINE> France Urges Turkey to Withdraw Troops from Northern Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 15 (Xinhua) -- France today urged Turkey to withdraw
its troops from northern Iraq as quickly as possible, and
expressed concern over the consequences of the Turkish
government's operation against the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK)
on ordinary people in the region.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt called on the
Turkish authorities to ensure that human rights were respected and
to ensure the civilian population was not affected by the fighting.
</P>
<P>
He also urged Turkey to stick to its statement made at the
launch of the operation on Wednesday that the action would end
soon.
</P>
<P>
France is worried that the Turkish intervention could
complicate the "fragile" situation in northern Iraq, Rummelhardt
said.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Turkish troops, backed by tanks and heavy
artillery, crossed the Turkish-Iraqi border on Wednesday in a
military operation against Kurdish separatist forces of the PKK
based in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Turkey claims that the PKK, which has bases and camps in
northern Iraq, has flourished near the Turkish border since Baghdad
lost control of the area following the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
More than 22,000 people have been killed in more than 12 years of
fighting between the Turkish army and the PKK, which is pursuing
an armed campaign for a Kurdish homeland in southeast Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Imported Tobacco Chokes Ukraine's Cigarette Makers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine's cigarette production is
forecast to fall 12 percent this year, but not because Ukrainians
are smoking any less.
</P>
<P>
Foreign tobacco and cigarettes are flooding the Ukrainian
market, forcing domestic cigarette makers to cut production to
under 40 billion cigarettes in 1997, down 12 percent over the
previous year, said Olga Yurchenko, director of UkrTiutium, the
Ukrainian Association of Tobacco Manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
Yurchenko complained that the Ukrainian government's measures
to stem the flow of cigarette imports has proved ineffective.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the government set minimum prices for tobacco
products and cracked down on cigarette smuggling to protect the
interests of domestic producers.
</P>
<P>
However, most Ukrainian cigarette producers use imported raw
materials.
</P>
<P>
Of the 45,000 tons of tobacco that went into making 45 billion
cigarettes in Ukraine last year, only 3,600 tons was
domestically produced.
</P>
<P>
UkrTiumtiun officials are lobbying the government to set
aside two percent of its tax revenues from the sale of cigarettes
to subsidize Ukraine's tobacco growers.
</P>
<P>
They say this will allow cigarette makers to increase the share
of Ukrainian tobacco in domestic cigarette production.
</P>
<P>
UkrTiutium is also concerned about the lack of quality control
over imported tobacco because the Ukrainian Customs doesn't have
the necessary equipment to ensure quality standards.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, analysts forecast that if Ukraine cancels tax breaks
for foreign enterprises, foreign investment in its tobacco
industry will slump dramatically.
</P>
<P>
The tobacco sector has attracted 130 million dollars in foreign
investment since 1992, accounting for about 10 percent of the
country's total foreign investment capital.

<P>
PARIS, May 15 (Xinhua) -- At least 30 villagers, most of them
women and children, were massacred Wednesday night in a farmstead
30 kilometers south of the Algerian capital Algiers, the
government said today.
</P>
<P>
The victims, among them two babies, 15 children and seven
women, were massacred by "a group of terrorists," a spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
But witnesses said that 36 people had their throats cut or were
shot dead in the massacre, which brought to 450 the number of
people killed by terrorists in their attacks upon villages and
bomb attacks in cities since April.
</P>
<P>
Five car bomb attacks which took place in Algiers on Sunday
killed between 11 and 16 people in the capital, Algerian

<HEADLINE> Kinkel Says Moscow Has No Veto Over NATO Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 15 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel
today rejected Russian President Boris Yeltsin's view that
Wednesday's historic deal with NATO gave Russia a veto over NATO's
planned eastward expansion.
</P>
<P>
"Russia will not take part in making the decision on who will
join NATO in the first wave," Kinkel told the German radio station
Deutschlandfunk.
</P>
<P>
He said that the draft accord on the future relationship
between Russia and the U.S.-led western military alliance was
wrongly interpreted by Russian President Boris Yeltsin, who
indicated Wednesday that Moscow would have a veto over NATO
expansion.
</P>
<P>
In a televised interview Wednesday night, Yeltsin said that
under the draft document to be signed by Russia and NATO countries
on May 27, NATO could "make decisions only after consensus is
reached through consultations (with Russia)".
</P>
<P>
NATO would make decisions on all issues concerning its future
on its own, Kinkel stressed. He said a joint cooperation council
would be created to deal with issues of common interest to NATO
and Russia, and in this council Russia will "of course have a say
understandably". But this clearly did not concern NATO expansion,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel made clear Germany was ready to sign the accord, agreed
on Wednesday by NATO Secretary General Javier Solana and Russian
Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov but not yet approved by the 16
NATO member governments.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, known as the NATO-Russia Founding Act, is
intended to formalize Russian input into European security
structures as NATO expands to include eastern European countries
which used to be Russia's allies in the Warsaw Pact.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel said there was an agreement not to reveal the details of
the accord until 10 a.m. (0800 GMT) on Friday, and that he could
therefore not yet make any final judgment.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel said the agreement, which is due to be signed at a
ceremony in Paris on May 27 by NATO members and Moscow, would form
the basis of a new European security structure in which Russia
would be included.

<HEADLINE> Quebec Partition Likely After Separation, Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The majority of Canadians believe
that the province of Quebec will face partition if it separates
from Canada, according to a poll published today.
</P>
<P>
A Southam News/Compas poll found that up to 78 percent of
Canadians outside the French-speaking province anticipate it to
lose land as part of the price of independence.
</P>
<P>
In addition, about 50 percent of Quebecers agree that if Canada
is divisible, so is Quebec, according to the poll, which surveyed
2,450 people across the country from May 1 to 7.
</P>
<P>
The poll found that 92 percent of Canadians living outside
Quebec believe the province's Aboriginal people have the right to
stay with Canada in the event of a vote for independence.
</P>
<P>
This view is shared by an overwhelming 75 percent of Quebecers.
</P>
<P>
The poll results came as the Quebec issue moves to center stage
in the ongoing national election campaign.
</P>
<P>
Further, the results suggest that if Quebecers believe that
voting Yes would mean partition, they would be much less likely to
vote Yes.
</P>
<P>
"The issue of partition benefits the federalist side," said
Compas chairman Conrad Winn. "This may explain the sometimes
intense reaction of sovereignists to any discussion of the topic."
</P>
<P>
Before the 1995 referendum, the partition of Quebec was an idea
confined to only a few federalist pundits.
</P>
<P>
The narrow win of the No side by 50.6 percent of the vote made
many people to consider seriously what they would do if the Yes
side ever won a majority.
</P>
<P>
"It's the logical answer: if Canada is divisible, so is
Quebec," Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien noted shortly after
the referendum.

<HEADLINE> Tung: HK People Able to Build Better Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The people of Hong Kong are
ready, willing and immensely capable of building an even better
life for themselves as members of the SAR of the People's Republic
 of China, Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (SAR) Tung Chee Hwa said today.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a keynote speech at the Asia Society Annual Dinner
here this evening, Tung said many recent surveys have shown that
the people of Hong Kong are confident that the HKSAR government
will succeed.
</P>
<P>
"The confidence, which stands at 80 percent, is at an all-time
high and is certainly reflected in our booming stock market and
real estate market," he said.
</P>
<P>
Refuting the perception that confidence in Hong Kong has
completely eroded and that Hong Kong will cease to be a commercial
hub in Asia, Tung said the reality is that the Heritage Foundation
rated Hong Kong as the freest economy in the world while the World
Economic Forum regards Hong Kong as the second most attractive
international economy.
</P>
<P>
"Despite 12 years' advance notice of the handover, Hong Kong
continues to be the regional headquarters to more than 700 major
multinational corporations and 85 of the top 100 international
banks," he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the HKSAR will absolutely be able to retain a
high degree of autonomy and the leadership of the country is very
much committed to the "one country, two systems," "Hong Kong
people governing Hong Kong" principle.
</P>
<P>
"In the five months since I assumed this responsibility, my
confidence level, in this respect, is higher as each day goes by,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He said all the success factors of Hong Kong will be maintained
and strengthened by the HKSAR government.
</P>
<P>
"I am confident that I will take on the responsibility for the
coming five years successfully," he declared.

<HEADLINE> Two Policemen Killed by Guerrillas in West Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Two policemen were killed today
in a western Nepali village by leftist guerrillas who have
launched a campaign boycotting the local elections scheduled for
Saturday, official sources here said.
</P>
<P>
A sub-inspector and a constable died on the spot when the armed
guerrillas hiding in a house in the village of Rukum District,
about 250 kilometers from Kathmandu, opened fire at a police
patrol team, an official from the district said.
</P>
<P>
Three other policemen were seriously wounded in the attack and
have been brought here by helicopter for treatment, he added.
</P>
<P>
The anti-election leftist guerrillas have recently increased
their activities in West Nepal's hilly areas in order to foil the
local elections.
</P>
<P>
Despite the government's special security arrangements like
deploying more police personnel in rural areas, the guerrillas
have successfully interrupted the electoral process in some remote
villages by spreading death threats among would-be candidates.
</P>
<P>
The Election Commission last week decided to indefinitely
postpone the elections in about 40 villages of some western
districts as no nominations have been filed there under the
guerrillas' boycott campaign.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Bamdev Gautum told reporters
here today that the local polls have been boycotted in 62
villages.
</P>
<P>
Many candidates in some remote villages who filed their
nominations earlier have reportedly been forced to withdraw their
candidacy under the guerrillas' pressure, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the deputy prime minister, who was from the
Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist Leninist, CPN-UML), the
government has formed a task force to resolve the security crisis
in West Nepal by political means.

<HEADLINE> France "Regrets" Cancellation of Mobutu-Kabila Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 15 (Xinhua) -- France today said it deeply regretted
the cancellation of a second meeting between Zairean President
Mobutu Sese Seko and rebel leader Laurent-Desire Kabila designed
to bring about peace in the war-torn African country.
</P>
<P>
"We are wondering about the motives put forward by Mr. Kabila
for refusing at the last minute to take part in this negotiation
and we wonder if the will to reach a peaceful solution in
resolving the Zairean crisis is equally shared by the two sides
(in Zaire)," French Foreign Ministry spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt
said.
</P>
<P>
He also hoped that the "unflagging efforts" made by South
African President Nelson Mandela to arrange a negotiated solution
to the Zairean crisis would finally lead to something.
</P>
<P>
Mandela called off planned talks on a South African navy
vessel in response to Kabila's last-minute demand Wednesday
evening that the talks be held in international waters and not in
Congo's port of Pointe Noire.
</P>
<P>
Kabila, whose forces now control three-quarters of the nation,
had insisted on talks at sea for security reasons.
</P>
<P>
Rebels took up arms in October demanding Zairean nationality
for ethnic Tutsis and have made lightning advances across the
nation. They claimed their forces are nearing Kinshasa but the
government has dismissed such reports.
</P>
<P>
Mobutu, who suffers from cancer, agreed at peace talks on May 4
to hand power to an elected president but Kabila has insisted that
Mobutu hand over power at once to his Alliance of Democratic
Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire.

<HEADLINE> China Sets New Share Quota at 30 Billion Yuan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 15 (Xinhua) -- China plans to issue 30 billion
yuan-worth of new shares this year, the State Planning Commission
and the Securities Committee of the State Council jointly
announced today.
</P>
<P>
This move is aimed at giving better support to the national
economy and the large and medium-sized state enterprises, said the
announcement.
</P>
<P>
The expansion of the new shares to be issued this year will
allow such enterprises to raise funds through stock placement and
prompt them to improve their management, which is expected to
result in a standardized development of the Chinese securities
market, according to the announcement.
</P>
<P>
Aside from the companies already on the waiting list to float
shares, the government will also encourage some of the listed
companies to issue more shares, said the announcement.
</P>
<P>
The probable candidates from the listed companies will be large
and medium-sized state firms having the support of the state's
industrial policy and a good profit-making record. They also need
to have a relatively small amount of listed shares, with the state
being the controlling stockholder, according to the announcement.
</P>
<P>
The announcement also urged related government departments at
all levels to be strict in selecting companies for listing.

<HEADLINE> EC Proposes Export Tax on Cereals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC) has
approved a proposal to introduce a tax on the export of certain
cereals and cereal products in order to stabilise wheat prices, it
was learned here today.
</P>
<P>
The level of the tax which can be adjusted in future in the
light of market developments is set at(in ECU/tonne): durum
wheat:10.00; common wheat: 15.00; durum wheat flour:15.00; common
wheat flour: 20.00; durum wheat semolina: 15.00; common wheat
semolina: 20.00. One ECU equals about 1.13 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, wheat prices have been increasing due to a
generally low level of world stocks and uncertainty in regard to
the outlook for this year's harvest both within and outside the EU
as a result of climatic influence.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on this decision, EU Agriculture Commissioner Franz
Fischler said that the introduction of this tax was "merely a
precautionary measure to avoid an overheating of the EU cereals
market".

<HEADLINE> Chinese, French Presidents Hold Talks (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Both presidents agreed that in the current situation when the
world is moving toward multi-polarization, China and France
should step up consultation and co-operation in international
affairs.
</P>
<P>
The UN is playing an increasingly important role in the
handling of international and regional affairs, and China and
France, both being permanent members of the UN Security Council,
should further their links and coordinate their positions on the
promotion of the reform of the UN, promotion of disarmament,
crackdown on international terrorism, increasing aid for
development, support for multilateral trade and maintenance of
diversity of the world.
</P>
<P>
On the present world situation, Chirac said the two-polar world
no longer exists, and a multi-polarized world is now taking shape
worldwide. France and China should promote the harmonious
emergence and formation of such a world. Therefore, it is
necessary increase relations between France and China and between
Europe and China.
</P>
<P>
Jiang agreed with Chirac on this, and pointed out that over the
past year or so the world has quickened the pace of
multi-polarization, which has become a prominent characteristic of
the development of the current world situation.
</P>
<P>
China has always attached great importance to France's status
in and influence on international affairs, Jiang said, adding that
especially since Chirac took office, France has persisted in
pursuing an independent foreign policy and played a unique role in
many aspects.
</P>
<P>
Jiang reiterated that at this crucial moment prior to the turn
of the century and the transition in the world pattern, state
leaders of both China and France as well as statesmen of all
countries should take a wider-ranging view, follow the trend of
history and shoulder their historical responsibilities. This way
they can make concerted efforts to establish a just and rational
interantional political and economic order in the next century,
and make the 21st century a new century that will bring prosperity
and stability to all countries.
</P>

Qian Qichen, Chinese vice-premier and foreign minister, Wang
Zhongyu, head of the Chinese Government Reception Committee and

<HEADLINE> Kohl Welcomes Russia-NATO Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 15 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl today
welcomed Wednesday's agreement between Russia and NATO over their
future political and military relationship.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone conversation this morning with Russian President
Boris Yeltsin, the two leaders agreed that the pact, which had
been under negotiation since January, was a fundamental and
far-reaching step towards a durable guarantee of stability and
security in Europe, German government spokesman Peter Hausmann
said.
</P>
<P>
The document, which Hausmann said the German government had
contributed to negotiating, opened the perspective to a long-term
security partnership with Russia safeguarding the interests of
NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) and its future new
members, as well as those of Russia.
</P>
<P>
Kohl also congratulated NATO Secretary General Javier Solana
and Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov on the successful
conclusion of the negotiations over the agreement.
</P>
<P>
The 16-page accord has been under negotiation since January and
will map out relations between Russia and the western military
alliance after its enlargement to take in former Soviet bloc
countries in central and eastern Europe, a move that Russia has
strongly opposed.
</P>
<P>
The deal was designed to ease Russian fears that NATO's planned
expansion to take in former Soviet bloc countries would threaten
its security and create new divisions in Europe.
</P>
<P>
The details of the accord, which includes the creation of a
NATO-Russia permanent council in Brussels, have to be approved by
NATO's 16 member governments and Russian President Boris Yeltsin
before leaders meet for a planned May 27 signing ceremony in
Paris.

the motherland ended here today.
</P>
<P>
Xu Yicheng, a contestant from the Beijing Foreign Studies
University, and Yuan Yuan, from the University of International
Business and Economics, shared the first prize in the contest.
</P>
<P>
With the topics of "An End and A Beginning" and "Red Buds Come
Into Full Bloom After A Hundred Years of Waiting", Xu and Yuan
greatly impressed the audience with their speeches.
</P>
<P>
The contestants all expressed their viewpoints on the history
of Hong Kong, the "one country, two systems" concept, the
procedure of Hong Kong's return and its significance, as well as
the prospects for the region.
</P>
<P>
After the contest Hu Wenzhong, a professor at Beijing Foreign
Studies University and chairman of the panel of judges, said he
had attended many English speech contests before, but none had the
significance as this one.
</P>
<P>
The return of Hong Kong is a topic that tapped the creativeness
and potentiality of all the contestants, he said.
</P>
<P>
Xia Qiang, deputy secretary of the Educational Work Commission
of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of
China, told Xinhua that the return of Hong Kong draws a lot of
attention among college students at present, and the universities
in Beijing have conducted many activities to review Hong Kong's
history and increase their understanding of the "one country, two
systems" concept.
</P>
<P>
Xia, also deputy director of the organizing body of the
contest, remarked that it had not only helped the students
understand history and improve their academic studies, but also
provided a chance to practice their speaking.
</P>
<P>
The contest was jointly sponsored by the Educational Work
Commission of the CPC Beijing Municipal Committee, the Beijing
Municipal Education Commission and the Beijing Television Station.
</P>
<P>
In the audience were Zhang Xiaowen, vice-minister in charge of
the State Education Commission, and Lu Yucheng, deputy mayor of
Beijing, as well as leading officials from relevant departments
including the Foreign Ministry and the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs
Office of the State Council.

<HEADLINE> Luxury, Extravagance to Be Rooted Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 15 (Xinhua) -- A national teleconference
made a decision here today to focus on banning luxury
and extravagance in the campaign to fight corruption and
build a clean government this year.
</P>
<P>
Wei Jianxing, secretary of the Central Commission for
Discipline Inspection of the Chinese Communist Party, said that
president Jiang Zemin's important speech at the eighth plenary
session of the commission is of realistic and historic
significance for the anti-corruption campaign.
</P>
<P>
He said the Party's fine tradition of working hard ensures its
political superiority, and this spirit should be emphasized
more nowadays.
</P>
<P>
Because of the influence of the decadent ideas and life styles
of the bourgeoisie as well as of feudalism, some Party members and
cadres have forgotten this tradition, Wei explained.
</P>
<P>
In some places and units excessive consumption and extravagance
have run rampant, he said, adding that even some leaders have an
incorrect understanding of the issue, thus creating a hotbed for
corrupt activities.
</P>
<P>
He asked all departments and industries to focus on promoting
the tradition of hard work and thrift, and honestly implement the
rules and regulations banning luxury and extravagance.
</P>
<P>
He said that various kinds of excessive consumption and
extravagance appear in specific work areas. Therefore, professional
departments should improve management and strengthen financial
discipline to deal with the problem.
</P>
<P>
He called on the public, lawmakers, government advisors and the
media to supervise officials' activities.
</P>
<P>
Government leaders must take the lead in this regard, he said,
adding that leading officials of the Party committees and
the government must take personal charge of the work.

<HEADLINE> Legislation Boosts China's Law Profession </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 15 (Xinhua) -- China's newly-published Lawyers'
Law has spurred the development of the lawyer profession since it
was adopted one year ago, according to Minister of Justice Xiao
Yang.
</P>
<P>
The number of lawyers surpassed 100,000 and that of law firms
totaled some 8,200 across the country at the end of last year,
Xiao told a forum held here today to mark the first anniversary of
the promulgation of the law.
</P>
<P>
The lawyers have handled more than 1.6 million lawsuits and
other legal business in the past year, as well as providing
services as legal consultants for 250,000 government agencies and
enterprises, Xiao said.
</P>
<P>
The law was adopted by the 19th Plenary Session of the Eighth
National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, China's top
legislative body, on May 15 last year.
</P>
<P>
"The law was not only a milestone in the development of the
country's lawyer system, it also marked an advance in the course
of improving the socialist legal system," Xiao noted.
</P>
<P>
Jurisprudence has become a profession that is arousing popular
interest in China because lawyers are becoming increasingly
important in society, he said.
</P>
<P>
More than 120,000 people took national examinations to
qualify as lawyers last year.
</P>
<P>
Xiao urged lawyers to continuously improve their professional
levels and capability of handling lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
The forum was attended by Wang Guangying, vice-chairman of the
NPC Standing Committee, law experts and officials from the Supreme
People's Court, the Supreme People's Procuratorate, the Ministry
of Public Security and the Bureau of the Legislative Affairs under
the State Council.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan, India to Devise Mechanism for Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The foreign secretaries of
Pakistan and India, who will meet here in the next few weeks, will
"devise a mechanism to discuss bilateral issues in an integrated
and structured manner," Foreign Office spokesman Khalid Salim said
today.
</P>
<P>
Answering questions at a press conference here, Salim said
solution of all outstanding issues among the member states of the
South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) and
creation of a level playing field are the two essential elements
for exploiting the potential of the South Asia Free Trade Area.
</P>
<P>
He denied reports that Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif
held talks with former Afghan President Burhanuddin Rabbani at the
extraordinary summit of the Economic Cooperation Organization
(ECO) held in Ashkhabad, the Turkmen capital, from Tuesday to
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Rabbani's regime is no longer the legitimate government of
Afghanistan," he said. "That's the reason the Afghan seat at the
Organization of the Islamic Conference summit here last March was
kept vacant."
</P>
<P>
When commenting on Uzbek President Islam Karimov's criticism of
Pakistan's support to the Taliban at the ECO summit, the spokesman
said, "We expressed our regrets that he made such a statement."
</P>
<P>
"We have been making serious efforts for an intra-Afghan
dialogue under the United Nations and the Organization of the
Islamic Conference in order to work for a broad-based and
acceptable government in the country," he said.
</P>
<P>
"To make allegations of this kind would only lead to the
vitiation of the atmosphere," he said.

<HEADLINE> HK Approves Use of Hydraulic Hammers for Percussive Piling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Housing Authority's
Building Committee today approved the use of hydraulic hammers in
place of diesel ones for percussive piling work in four selected
piling contracts here.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the authority said here that the decision was
taken with a view to facilitating a smooth transition to the Noise
Control (Amendment) Bill, which is expected to become law soon
and is due to be effective from April next year.
</P>
<P>
Under this new legislation, the use of diesel hammers will be
gradually phased out over a period of two years.
</P>
<P>
The diesel hammer is the most common type of driving hammers
used for percussive piling in the trade of construction in Hong
Kong. But it is considered an environmental hazard for producing
much noise and emitting black smoke.
</P>
<P>
Hydraulic hammers, which are comparatively less noisy and
produce much less air pollution, are a practical substitute for
diesel ones.
</P>
<P>
It will be stipulated in the tender documents of the four
selected contracts, which will be tendered out between June and
August, that hydraulic hammers are required to be used for
installation of driven piles for one domestic block. Diesel
hammers can still be used for the rest of the piling works.

<HEADLINE> New Changes Proposed to Two HK Ordinances </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The Chief Executive's Office of
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) today
published a revised package of amendments to the Public Order
Ordinance and the Societies Ordinance, noting that these changes
will be put before the legislators this weekend.
</P>
<P>
Michael Suen, secretary for policy coordination under the Chief
Executive Office, told a press conference that the revised
amendments to the two ordinances were made public after public
consultation and careful analysis of the views expressed.
</P>
<P>
"During the consultation, the public have expressed support for
the three fundamental principles underlying the proposed
amendments to the two ordinances," he said.
</P>
<P>
The three principles are "first, there has to be a proper
balance between civil liberties and social order; second, we must
uphold the Basic Law and the International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights as they are applied to Hong Kong; and third, we
should guard against interference by foreign political forces in
local political activities."
</P>
<P>
He said, "We have listened carefully to public opinions on the
consultation document and have taken positive steps to address the
concerns expressed."
</P>
<P>
In early April, the office issued a consultation document to
solicit opinions and suggestions from the communities on its
proposals on the amendments to the two ordinances.
</P>
<P>
The proposals were made by the office in line with the
resolution of the Standing Committee of China's National People's
Congress that major amendments to the two ordinances introduced in
1992 and 1995 respectively shall not be adopted as the laws of the
HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
Responding to reporters' questions, Suen said that a total of
11 amendments have been introduced to the original proposals. For
example, "national security" will be clearly defined in the law to
refer to "the safeguarding of the territorial integrity and the
independence of the People's Republic of China.'"
</P>
<P>
"The prohibition on foreign donations will now be restricted to
'direct or indirect financial contributions from foreign political
organizations' only with the removal of the references to 'aliens'
and 'foreign organizations'," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The financial contributions from political organizations in
Taiwan will be provided for separately in the law," Suen added.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the proposals "only advocate the orderly
management and operation of societies," "aim at striking a proper
balance between civil liberties and social order," and "guard
against interference by foreign political forces in local
political activities."
</P>
<P>
"The Chief Executive and the HKSAR Executive Council are firmly
committed to safeguarding individual rights and freedoms which
Hong Kong currently enjoys," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
During the three-week consultation, the Chief Executive's
Office received a total of 5,507 written submissions, of which
4,744 are standard letters of one from or another, Suen said,
noting that groups and organizations accounted for 932 of the
submissions, and the remaining 4,575 submissions came from
individuals.
</P>
<P>
He said that these proposals are contained in the Societies
(Amendment) Bill 1997 and Public Order (Amendment) Bill 1997,
which will be introduced into the Provisional Legislative Council
on May 17, 1997.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Consumer Price Stable in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Canadian consumers paid 1.7 percent
more for the goods and services contained in the Consumer Price
Index (CPI) basket this April than the same period last year,
Statistics Canada reported today.
</P>
<P>
Compared with April 1996, Canadian consumers paid more for new
vehicles and vehicle insurance, university tuition, clothing,
rental accommodation and meat.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, they paid less for mortgage loans, fresh
vegetables and soft drinks, the federal agency said.
</P>
<P>
April's 1.7 percent increase was lower than the annual rates of
2.0 to 2.2 percent seen in the previous months.
</P>
<P>
"The slowdown in overall inflation was related to smaller
movements in the transportation and food sectors," the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Compared with March, the CPI registered no change in April.
Price increases for clothing and several other commodities offset
price declines for natural gas, gasoline and food.

<HEADLINE> Weightlifting to Make Major Changes From Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PUSAN, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The sport of weightlifting may have major
changes from next year, according to the Chinese Weightlifting
Association (CWA) here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Qian Guangjian, Secretary-General of the CWA, said that the 10
categories in the men's and the listed nine divisions in the women's
weightlifting will be deducted to eight and seven respectively.
</P>
<P>
"This change is to be in line with the inclusion of women's
weightlifting at the 2,000 Olympic Games in Sydney," he said.
</P>
<P>
In Sydney in 2,000, women lifters will make their debut in Olympic
history when four divisions of women's weightlifting are included in
the official sports programme.
</P>
<P>
With the inclusion of women's weightlifting in Sydney, the 10
categories in men's section should be deducted to eight on the Olympic
arena.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that the plan will be discussed in the congress of the
International Weightlifting Federation (IWF) later this month. "If the
plan is approved in the congress, it will take effect from January 1,
1998," he added.
</P>
<P>
In the year 1993, the IWF made a thorough change of the ten
categories in men's weightlifting, aiming to clean the name of the
sport, which was smeared by doping scandals.

<HEADLINE> Village Autonomy in China Helps Rural Economy (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Village autonomy has meant that, through competition, capable
persons who understand business management and do things properly
are elected as village cadres.
</P>
<P>
In the village of Fashi, Cai Qingquan, who is regarded as
knowledgeable, experienced, and clever, was chosen village
committee director through direct election in 1987 after retiring
from the army.
</P>
<P>
In April of this year, he was elected a fourth time. Since
then, he has been concerned about how to bring the villagers a
better life. He often discusses ways of improving the village
economy with other members of the village committee and village
representatives
</P>
<P>
The committee has got many people working in knitting,
clothing, and making resin handicrafts. It has also got villagers
to level three sand dunes to set up two tracts of land for living
quarters with an overall construction plan, build a new
kindergarten, and improve teaching facilities in the village
primary school.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the village has established an amusement center, a
library, and two parks.
</P>
<P>
In talking about the changes in the village over the past
years, the 73-year-old Cai betrays his deep feelings: "Only a
dozen years ago, my family used to eat sweet potato porridge twice
a day. Now we have rice every day, and we eat fish and meat often."
</P>
<P>
"We used oil lamps in the past, now there is electricity, and
many people have electric appliances in their homes. Most people
have telephones and they use gas for cooking. People go out on
motorcycles, or even in cars," the old man said.

<TEXT>
<P>
But still Cai is not satisfied. As soon as he was elected new
director of the village committee last month, he called together
members of the new village committee to discuss detailed plans for
helping the village economy.
</P>
<P>
This year's goal is for total industrial output in the village
of 120 million yuan -- and 200 million yuan by 1999.
</P>
<P>
The villages of coastal Fujian have not been the only ones to
benefit from village autonomy. Many villages in the inland areas
have also benefitted. Wuqiu Village in Hebei Province in north
China is a case in point.
</P>
<P>
It was in disarray for a long period of time. But, a village
committee elected directly by the villagers set about imparting
some order and looking for ways to get rid of the poverty. Village
cadres got the villagers to start businesses and plant fruit
trees. The village is now better off.
</P>
<P>
Lanzhou Village in northwest China's Gansu Province has no
more than 1,000 people. In recent years, the village committee has
been showing the advantage of village autonomy, and has got
villagers to start a dozen businesses, and more than 70 percent of
the village's work force are doing these businesses.
</P>
<P>
Lishu County in northeast China's Jilin Province is a national
model for autonomy. Its capable village cadres have found ways of
getting the average annual income of farmers up several hundred
yuan through raising pigs.
</P>
<P>
With the increased revenues, more than 120 million yuan has
been available for public affairs in the last several years.
</P>
<P>
"The achievements should be attributed to the implementation of
village autonomy," a deputy county magistrate was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
A Jilin provincial civil affairs official agrees to this,
saying, "With village autonomy and the people having their say in
major village affairs, everything can be done well."

<P>
Manila, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' all-cargo
international flag carrier, Pacific East Asia Cargo (PEAC), is
planning to add more traffic rights to several international
airports.
</P>
<P>
PEAC Managing Director Benjamin Solis told reporters the PEAC
is eyeing Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok, Vietnam, Sydney, Macao and the
two Chinese cities of Xiamen and Shanghai to augment its present
five weekly freighter services to Hong Kong, Taipei, Seoul and
Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
"The PEAC will pursue traffic rights into China and continue to
develop strategic alliances and synergies with our colleagues in
the international air cargo industry," Solis said.
</P>
<P>
With regional deregulation in the offing, alliances would be
part of the PEAC's formula to minimize the effects of unbridled
competition, Solis added.
</P>
<P>
Solis said the PEAC's Asian network has a huge growth potential
and a solid foundation to become one of the region's major
all-cargo carriers soon.

<HEADLINE> Arab League Condemns Turkish Incursion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The Cairo-based Arab League (AL)
today condemned Turkish incursion into northern Iraq and warned of
its negative effect on Arab ties with Turkey.
</P>
<P>
A statement released by the AL Secretariat expressed deep
concern over Wednesday's operation when several thousand Turkish
troops, backed by tanks and heavy artillery, pushed across the
border into northern Iraq at dawn.
</P>
<P>
It stressed that such assaults might negatively affect joint
interests and deeply-rooted relations between the Arab states and
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
"The use of military force to tackle reasons of tension in any
country would only aggravate the situation and jeopardize the
security of the area," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
The organization called on the Turkish government to withdraw
its forces from the Iraqi territories.
</P>
<P>
These actions "run contrary to the principle of good
neighborhood, international law and conventions and represent an
interference in Iraq's domestic affairs," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
A Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman had rejected Iraq's
accusation that Wednesday's attack violated its sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
He said the offensive was aimed at helping Kurdish Democratic
Party rebels in their fight against their rival, the Kurdistan
Workers Party (PKK) guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
The PKK, fighting for control in northern Iraq and also for
autonomy in southeastern Turkey, uses bases in Iraq to launch
cross-border attacks on Turkish security troops.

<HEADLINE> Li Peng Calls for Development of Cooperative Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng urged here
today that the supply and marketing cooperatives be run better to
further develop the rural economy and help farmers achieve common
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
The supply and marketing cooperatives, set up in the 1950s,
are collectively-owned trading agencies for China's
farmers. Nearly 200 million households in rural areas are
connected with the system.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to a national meeting on the work, Li said that the
cooperatives have been playing an even more important role in
serving the agricultural sector, the rural areas and the
farmers.
</P>
<P>
He said that he hoped that cadres and workers in the system
would continue to exchange ideas and turn it into a real
cooperative economic organization belonging to and run by the
farmers themselves, thereby further developing the rural economy
and realizing common prosperity in the countryside.
</P>
<P>
State Councillor Chen Junsheng commended some outstanding
workers in the system. He said that they are model workers who
have been voluntarily providing services for the farmers, and
their selfless spirit should be encouraged throughout the whole of
society.
</P>
<P>
He urged that the reform of the grass-roots cooperatives be
stepped up by improving management and services, and by carrying out
political education among both the cadres and workers.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Give the Disabled Equal Opportunities in Society (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 15 (Xinhua) -- To many Chinese, disabled persons
are often referred to as "can fei", which literally means
"incomplete and useless". But 27-year-old Ding Tiejun would never
apply the tag to himself, although he has been a victim of severe
brain damage since the day he was born.
</P>
<P>
In his opinion, the term "can fei" rather represents a
prejudice against disabled people, namely, only a healthy person
can be of use to society; a disabled person is someone to
pity rather than an equal participant in social life.
</P>
<P>
"This conception must be changed," emphasized Ding. The young
man, who has been confined to a wheelchair since childhood due to
cerebral palsy, firmly believes that "disabled persons are also
entitled to equal opportunities in society, and rehabilitation
helps them to overcome physiological and psychological obstacles
to regaining this right and realizing their value as human beings."
</P>
<P>
It was this belief that motivated Ding to establish in December
1992 the first community rehabilitation center for the disabled in
China run by a patient suffering from cerebral palsy. The
center, named "Aikang" or "health-loving", is in Ding's home in
northeast Beijing. Its staff consists of Ding and a score of
volunteers.
</P>
<P>
The young man called the establishment of the center "the first
step in my efforts to return to society and equally participate in
social life". He said that this makes him feel happy and
fulfilled.
</P>
<P>
This first step was made after years of efforts by himself and
his family to fight despair and seek a new horizon in life.
</P>
<P>
A mind is free to fly even though the body which contains it is
confined. "I loved to think about all kinds of things when I was a
little boy. What are the things in other people's minds? And what is
the world really like?" said Ding.
</P>
<P>
Refusing to idle his days away, little Ding began to learn
primary school courses from his elder sister. Later, he started to
read books on philosophy, logic, medicine and psychology. He even
gained a diploma in traditional Chinese medicine from a
correspondence school.

<HEADLINE> Earth Gives Humans 33 Trillion-dollar Gift Every Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The Earth gives humans 33 trillion
U.S. dollars worth of "goods" for free each year, nearly twice the
world's annual gross national product of 18 trillion dollars,
scientists and economists claimed in a journal published today.
</P>
<P>
The Earth's economic value to the world's people provided
by resources such as air, sea, rivers, mountains and food, falls
in the range of between 16 trillion and 54 trillion dollars a
year, with an average of 33 trillion dollars, the scientific team
reported in the journal Nature.
</P>
<P>
The scientists calculated the economic value of 17 ecosystem
services and broke their analysis down by biological sectors.
They say for example, that forests provide 141 dollars worth of
atmospheric gas regulation per hectare per year.
</P>
<P>
Forests also provide climate and disturbance regulation, water
regulation, nutrient cycling, waste treatment, food production,
raw materials, genetic resources, recreation and cultural
enjoyment to the tune of 969 dollars per hectare per year.
</P>
<P>
The study was carried out by Robert Costanza of the University
of Maryland and his colleagues. The figure was calculated using
recent published studies and some original calculations.
</P>
<P>
The numbers presented by the researchers are not meant to be
definitive -- their aim is to lay out the value of ecosystem
services in a form which would be useful for policy makers and the
public, and to stimulate debate.
</P>
<P>
The researchers said that the resources they have studied are
ignored by other economists, who consider only products that are
easier to value, such as man-made goods. The result is that these
major contributions to human welfare are not considered in
important political and economic decisions.
</P>
<P>
"What this study makes abundantly clear is that ecosystem
services provide an important portion of the total contribution to
human welfare on this planet," they said.
</P>
<P>
"If ecosystem services were actually paid for, in terms of
their value contribution to the global economy, the global price
system would be very different from what it is today," they said.

<HEADLINE> Village Autonomy In China Helps Rural Economy (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The people of Chaole Village in
east China's province of Fujian had found themselves at a
crossroads in their lives: because of the sluggish fishing
business, they had to decide whether to go on with fishing or
to look for other businesses ashore.
</P>
<P>
So, more than 5,200 residents of this traditional fishing
village held a series of meetings to discuss the village's
future, and a consensus was reached: A village committee was
chosen directly by the villagers, and it in turn reached a
decision that Chaole should start on the development road by
starting businesses ashore.
</P>
<P>
By the early 1990s, the village had begun its rolling
development plan. It has spent two million yuan (24,000 US
dollars) establishing a "Chaole Industrial Zone", and now has 29
enterprises there. Its industrial output value reached 130
million yuan in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Standing on top of the village committee's office building,
Jing Jinding, the committee's director, showed reporters the new
houses several stories tall in the fishing village and remarked:
"Without the autonomy of the villagers, there would be no
democratic decision-making and democratic management, and the
development of Chaole Village would not be so fast and smooth."
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhenyao, a senior official with the Ministry of Civil
Affairs, who is in charge of building grass-roots political power,
says that in rural China, village autonomy is universal. "The
autonomy of villagers has become the direct force that is
bolstering the rural economy and safeguarding social stability in
the countryside," he adds.

<HEADLINE> HK, Japan Sign Investment Protection Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's Financial Secretary
Donald Tsang signed in Tokyo today on behalf of Hong Kong an
internationally binding Investment Promotion and Protection
Agreement (IPPA) with Japan.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government was represented at the singing ceremony
by Foreign Minister Yukihiko Ikeda, according to a Hong Kong
government announcement here.
</P>
<P>
At the ceremony, Tsang expressed his warm welcome to an
announcement by the Japanese government to accept the passport of
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) as a valid
travel document and extend to SAR passport holders the same visa
privileges as those granted to holders of BN(O) passports.
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the IPPA, the two governments will provide
equal treatment for investors, compensate any investments that may
be expropriated and permit free transfer of investments and
returns.
</P>
<P>
The agreement also provides for the settlement of investment
disputes in accordance with internationally accepted rules.
</P>
<P>
At present, Japan is the leading overseas investor in Hong
Kong. As of 1995, investment from Japan amounted to 191.4 billion
HK dollars (24.5 billion U.S. dollars) in total net asset at
original cost, representing 24.6 percent of the total foreign
investment in Hong Kong.
</P>

Hong Kong's accumulated investment in Japan was 202 million HK
dollars (25.8 million U.S. dollars) in 1995, accounting for 0.7
percent of total foreign investment in Japan.
</P>
<P>
This is the 12th agreement that Hong Kong has signed in the
area of investment promotion and protection. Hong Kong has signed
similar accords with the Netherlands, Australia, Denmark, Sweden,
Switzerland, New Zealand, Italy, France, Germany, Belgium,
Luxembourg and Austria.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Give the Disabled Equal Opportunities in Society (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 15 (Xinhua) -- To many Chinese, disabled persons
are ofter referred to as "can fei", which literally means
"incomplete and useless". But 27-year-old Ding Tiejun would never
apply the tag to himself, although he has been a victim of severe
brain damage since the day he was born.
</P>
<P>
In his opinion, the term "can fei" rather represents a
prejudice against disabled people, namely, only a healthy person
can be of use to society; a disabled person is someone to
pity rather than an equal participant in social life.
</P>
<P>
"This conception must be changed," emphasized Ding. The young
man, who has been confined to a wheelchair since childhood due to
cerebral palsy, firmly believes that "disabled persons are also
entitled to equal opportunities in society, and rehabilitation
helps them to overcome physiological and psychological obstacles
to regaining this right and realizing their value as human beings."
</P>
<P>
It was this belief that motivated Ding to establish in December
1992 the first community rehabilitation center for the disabled in
China run by a patient suffering from cerebral palsy. The
center, named "Aikang" or "health-loving", is in Ding's home in
northeast Beijing. Its staff consists of Ding and a score of
volunteers.
</P>
<P>
The young man called the establishment of the center "the first
step in my efforts to return to society and equally participate in
social life". He said that this makes him feel happy and
fulfilled.
</P>
<P>
This first step was made after years of efforts by himself and
his family to fight despair and seek a new horizon in life.
</P>
<P>
A mind is free to fly even though the body which contains it is
confined. "I loved to think about all kinds of things when I was a
little boy. What are the things in other people's minds? And what is
the world really like?" said Ding.
</P>
<P>
Refusing to idle his days away, little Ding began to learn
primary school courses from his elder sister. Later, he started to
read books on philosophy, logic, medicine and psychology. He even
gained a diploma in traditional Chinese medicine from a
correspondence school.

<P>
Like most disabled persons, Ding had dreamed of becoming whole
after proper treatment, and endured terrible pain in the course of
treatment.
</P>
<P>
In 1989, he came to the newly established Boai Hospital, under
the China Rehabilitation Research Center, full of hope. However,
doctors there told him that he would never be able to stand up
again, although proper rehabilitation exercise could help restore
his disabilities to the maximum.
</P>
<P>
Ding recalled: "Although it was very, very agonizing to give up
my dream, but it jerked me out of illusions and forced me to
stand up to reality."
</P>
<P>
It was during that time that Ding learned the basic points of
the art of rehabilitation: Disabilities are not just damaged or
lost physiological or psychological functions. What is more
important, they alienate disabled people from the mainstream of
society. And the purpose of rehabilitation is to restore the
disabled to participation in social life.
</P>
<P>
Hoping to help fellow disabled persons with his knowledge of
medicine and psychology, and with the support of his family and
the local association for the disabled, Ding set up the Aikang
Community Rehabilitation Center.
</P>
<P>
Ding prefers to call those who seek his help recipients of his
service rather than patients. Over the past four years and a half,
Ding has helped hundreds of disabled people from all across China
with advice on medical treatment, rehabilitation and psychological
problems.
</P>
<P>
"The important thing is to encourage and help disabled persons
to stand on their own feet," Ding noted. He helped polio
patient Zhang Yan start her own business, and teenager Wang Lei,
who also suffers from cerebral palsy, get admitted to a
polytechnic school.
</P>
<P>
Because of his work, Ding became one of the five people in
China to win the Outstanding Disabled Persons Award from Rotary
International in 1994. And he was among the 120 outstanding
disabled persons commended at a national conference recently.
</P>
<P>
To Ding, the Aikang Center has become a bridge between himself
and society, and it is helping more and more disabled persons to
participate in normal social life.
</P>
<P>
Looking forward to the future, Ding said, the most important
thing for him to do is to "improve my ability to survive and
progress, and continue to do things that will benefit social
development."

<HEADLINE> Senior Chinese Communist Party Official Meets With Ghanaians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Hu Jintao, a Standing Committee
member of the Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party
Central Committee, met with a delegation from the National
Democratic Congress (NDC) of Ghana here today, led by Kofi Attor,
deputy general-secretary of the NDC.
</P>
<P>
Hu said that the CPC and the Chinese government pay close
attention to the traditional friendship between China and Ghana
and bilateral co-operation in all areas.
</P>
<P>
Establishing contacts between the CPC and the NDC in accordance
with the four principles of party-to-party relations, he said,
will help deepen mutual understandings, expand co-operation, and
accelerate all-round development of Sino-Ghanaian ties.
</P>
<P>
Hu expressed his thanks for Ghana's consistent "one China"
stand, and its support for China in world affairs.
</P>
<P>
He said he greatly appreciates the important role played by the
NDC in the political life of Ghana. He wished the Ghanaian people
greater achievements in their national construction under
the leadership of president Jerry Rawlings.
</P>
<P>
Although Ghana and China are far from each other, Attor said,
the long-term and vigorous friendship between the two countries
has connected them closely.
</P>
<P>
The NDC pays close attention to China's achievements and
experience in its development, he said, and that the NDC is
willing to increase its friendly contacts with the CPC to further
promote the development of all-round friendly co-operative
relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The delegation arrived in Beijing on May 8 as guests of the
CPC.

<HEADLINE> Jordan's Opposition Party Calls for Forming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, May 15 (Xinhua) - Jordan's largest centrist party has
responded positively to the largest opposition party's call to
form a coalition government that will uphold an anti-Israeli
policy and exert more efforts on domestic issues, Jordan Times
reported today.
</P>
<P>
"We do not close door to anyone," said Hakim Kheir, Secretary
General for Information Affairs of the National Constitutional
Party (NCP), after the Islamic Action Front (IAF) Secretary
General Ishaq Farhan sent the message earlier this week, the
English newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
However, "the concept of a coalition government is very new
in Jordan and it is too early to talk about a coalition
government in which the NCP would participate with the IAF,"
kheir added.
</P>
<P>
The NCP was born from the merger of 9 centrist parties and
officially licensed by the Ministry of Interior earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the latest issue of Arabic weekly Al
Sabeel, Farhan said that "if the NCP agrees to form a coalition
government that would fight against normalization of ties with Israel,
prevent Zionist infiltration and place emphasis on issues of
domestic interests, we have no objection to becoming part of such
a coalition."
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, discussions over the possibility of a
coalition government were underway between former prime minister
Abdul Karim Kabariti and some IAF personalities. But diverging
stands on normalizing ties with Israel and the economic
adjustment reforms prescribed by the International Monetary Fund
deadlocked the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has seen no coalition government in its history. The
current government is under the premiership of Abdul-Salam
Majali who was appointed in March by King Hussein of Jordan.
</P>
<P>
There has been 17 political parties licensed by the
government since a four-decade ban on political pluralism was
lifted in 1991 by King Hussein, the country's monarch.

<HEADLINE> Pak to Face Revenue Shortfall of 1.25 Billion Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 15 (Xinhua) --Pakistan is expected to face a
revenue shortfall of 50 billion rupees (1.25 billion U.S. dollars)
in 1996-97 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
According to Deputy Chairman of the State Planning Commission
Hafiz Pasha, Pakistan is to realize 290 billion rupees (7.25
billion dollars) in revenue as against the target of 340 billion
rupees (8.5 billion dollars) for the current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Pasha told the local media today, "Even we get the low revenue
collection in remaining two months, it was not likely to go below
the mark of 290 billion rupees."
</P>
<P>
Out of the total shortfall of 50 billion rupees, the government
of the Pakistan People's Party (PPP) shared a lion's share of 40
billion rupees while the remaining 10 billion rupees was prompted
by the recently introduced economic reforms packages for the
various sectors, he said.
</P>
<P>
Tracing causes of the shortfall in revenues, Pasha said that
first of all the PPP government made an ambitious forecast of
revenue collection to the tune of 340 billion rupees for 1996-97
fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The impact of economic reforms, recently announced, would range
between six to eight billion rupees, he estimated.
</P>
<P>
Pasha said that out of the total shortfall of 50 billion
rupees, the share of the present government is less than the
one-fourth due to drastic economic reforms, badly needed for the
surgery of the sagging economy.
</P>
<P>
However, he ruled out the possibility of drastic decline in
revenue collection beyond 290 billion rupees, "even if we get the
low revenue collection in remaining two months".
</P>
<P>
"It was this major shortfall in the revenue generation that was
leading us to the budget deficit," he said.
</P>
<P>
Pasha said, the previous government made adjustment in the tax
rate but it failed to make any headway in reforming the tax
collection machinery.
</P>
<P>
The government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif was introducing
measures to overhaul the tax collection machinery to ensure
maximum realization of revenues besides plugging loopholes that
prompted culture of tax evasion, said Pasha.

<P>
BEIJING, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Vice-premier Qian Qichen, meeting
today with a delegation from Hong Kong's Guangdong Societies'
Committee led by its chairman Henry Fok Ying-tung, said he that is
delighted to note that the Guangdong societies are holding
various kinds of activities to celebrate the return of Hong Kong
to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's return to the motherland has been set, Qian said,
and people's confidence in it is increasing and there are good
conditions for a stable transition.
</P>
<P>
Despite the twists and turns during the transition period, he
said, on the whole, difficulties have been overcome. China's
political situation and society are stable, and the reforms and
opening to the outside world and economic construction have
continued to develop.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government will resolutely implement the "one
country, two systems" principle and the Hong Kong Basic Law, which
provides a guarantee for Hong Kong's smooth transition and long
stability and prosperity, Qian added.
</P>
<P>
He said that Hong Kong's return to the motherland is a major
event not only for the Chinese nation, but also for the rest of
the world before the end of the century. The end of Britain's
colonial rule and the settlement of problems left over from
history by means of peaceful negotiations are of great historic
significance, he said.
</P>
<P>
Qian expressed the belief that the Guangdong societies in Hong
Kong, together with other Hong Kong people, should be organized to
contribute to the celebration of Hong Kong's return and to a
stable transition.
</P>
<P>
He said it is his hope that the Guangdong societies in Hong
Kong will take the lead in supporting Chief Executive Tung Chee
Hwa of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) and the
work of the Hong Kong SAR government and the Provisional
Legislative Council.
</P>
<P>
Qian said this means supporting "one country, two systems" and
"the Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong", and that: "We should
rely on the strength of the Hong Kong compatriots to maintain the
region's stability and prosperity."

<HEADLINE> Peace-keepers in Liberia Increase to 13,000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 15 (Xinhua) -- With the last expected reinforcement
of west African soldiers arriving in Liberia this week, the
peace-keeping force there known as ECOMOG has now increased to
13,000, the "Nigerian Tribune" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Under the revised Abuja peace accord signed last August to end
the seven-year-old Liberian civil war, the ECOMOG was due to
increase its manpower from the then 8,500 to 13,000, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
In January, faced with a glaring deficit of troops, ECOMOG
Commander Victor Malu said he would need at least 12,500 men to
accomplish his mission.
</P>
<P>
The ECOMOG now comprises soldiers from 10 member countries of
the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). Its top
mission now is to provide a secure environment for the
forthcoming elections.
</P>
<P>
In another development, leaders of the Liberian interim
government and its 16 political parties, as well as officials of
the independent electoral commission will meet today in Abuja to
decide a final date for the elections.
</P>
<P>
The revised Abuja peace accord has provided May 30 for the
parliamentary and presidential elections, but 11 Liberian parties
recently suggested that the elections be postponed to not early
than October 13, citing mainly the security situation as their
reasons.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Villagers Take Action to Protect Wildlife (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Early this spring, a villager in a
remote mountain area, while cutting firewood near his house, found
a sick giant panda lying on the ground. He ran to a nearby
wildlife protection station some 30 km away and reported his
finding.
</P>
<P>
Several hours later, the giant panda was given emergency
treatment, and half a month later, it recovered and was sent back
to the woods.
</P>
<P>
The villager lives in the Sanguanmiao village in northwest
China's Shaanxi province. The village is located in the core area
of the Foping National Natural Reserve which is home to more than
60 giant pandas.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhan Jian, administration chief of the reserve,
during the past decade the reserve has cured 14 sick giant pandas,
most of them were first found and reported by local villagers.
</P>
<P>
"In our reserve such rare animals and birds like giant panda,
takin, and golden pheasant are often found appearing near
villagers' houses, and the villagers usually treat them very
friendly due to the raised awareness of wildlife protection," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that such awareness has been further spread after the
reserve was selected as one of the ten demonstration reserves in
China aided by the Global Environment Facility nearly two years
ago.
</P>
<P>
"Earlier this year we decided to confiscate the villagers'
hunting rifles so as to better protect the wildlife, after only a
little persuasion and education, all the rifles of the more than
300 villagers living within our reserve were soon handed over
without delay," Zhan said.
</P>
<P>
In the Shennongjia National Natural Reserve in Central China's
Hubei province, the Reserve Administration is also enjoying good
cooperation with the local villagers.
</P>
<P>
Zhan Quanyi, director of the Reserve Administration, said that
when heavy snow sealed the mountain area in recent years, the
local villagers were always mobilized by the government to do
something to help the wildlife.
</P>
<P>
"Usually villagers put some food on the main mountain passes
outside their villages," said the director.
</P>
<P>
He also said that sometimes some wild animals, driven by
hunger, came to villagers' pigsties for food. The villagers fed
them until the snow melted. "I remember one spring several years
ago, more than 100 muntjac were sent back to the mountains when
the heavy snow begun to thaw," he said.

In a town, it was said that five years ago there were still
people there selling specimens of wild animals and wild birds. But
in recent three years, these activities were never seen again.
</P>
<P>
The Xigou village, Honghua township in Shennongjia has 82
households and 321 villagers. On April 2 this year, the village
set up a 19-member Natural Resource Management Committee to help
the Reserve Administration in local wildlife protection.
</P>
<P>
"In the past it was the cadres that asked us to protect
wildlife, but now it is ourselves that want to protect the
wildlife for the good of our sons and grandsons," Mao Rizhao, head
of the village, told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
According to an official from the Ministry of Forestry, China's
natural protecting campaign has been undertaken for 40 years.
</P>
<P>
"During the 40 years great efforts have been made, especially
to raise the public awareness of wildlife protection," said the
official.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the Ministry of Forestry,
cooperating with the Global Environment Facility, is now making
detailed plans to encourage more local participation and local
involvement in the protection of wildlife and their natural
habitats.

<P>
Jiang Zemin called for greater efforts to look into and deal
with malfeasance by Party officials.
</P>
<P>
Both central and local discipline inspection departments, along
with the active support and participation of the masses, he said,
have intensified efforts to fight against corruption, improve
Party conduct, and build a clean government.
</P>
<P>
"However, it must be seen that to fight against corruption, to
improve the Party's work style, and to build clean government must
be carried out through the entire process of the reform, opening-up,
and modernization drive," he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang noted that the current situation of struggle against
corruption remains stark, the task to correct the Party's work
style remains arduous, and some negative and corrupt phenomena
have revived and even spread after being cracked down.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that some officials failed to give due attention
to such work, moving slowly on major cases, being slack in
correcting the misconducts in certain departments and trades, or
falling into formalism.
</P>
<P>
Greater determination and efforts and more down-to-earth work
should be done so as to make leading officials become clean and
self-disciplined, to investigate into and deal with lawbreaking
cases, and to correct the misconducts in some departments and
trades, Jiang said.

dealt with seriously, no matter whoever are involved, and no
matter what obstructions there may be," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"Corrupt phenomena among leading officials should draw greater
attention," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The misconducts of extorting, selling or buying, and cheating
official positions must firmly be halted. Although such
misconducts are not universal, they are hazardous and should be
given high priority, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Historical facts have shown that official corruption and
judicial corruption are the worst, and the key reason for breeding
and fostering other forms of corruption," he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang called attention to the fact that the fight to combat
corruption is a serious struggle which is related to the future
and fate of the Party and the country.
</P>
<P>
"As to this issue, our stance must be clear-cut, our attitude
must be resolute, the work must be done with perseverance," Jiang
said, adding that if the problem is not be handled properly and
well, the country's reform, opening-up, and modernization drive
will have no firm political guarantee and may go astray, and there
may be the hazard of the Party and country's demise.

<HEADLINE> Australian Stocks Close Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The Australian share market closed
weaker today as a string of uninspiring bank profit results and a
bleaker earnings outlook for the sector.
</P>
<P>
The all ordinaries index finished 5.4 points down at 2525.0,
after hitting a low of 2513.8 earlier.
</P>
<P>
"The banks really broke the market's back today," a
Melbourne-based trader said.
</P>
<P>
"There was a general lackluster tone across the board with the
banks taking most of the heat," he added.
</P>
<P>
Shares in the big four banks all fell as investors reassessed
the sector after recent record highs.
</P>
<P>
NAB Bank finished 23 cents down at 18.11 Australian dollars
after announcing an interim net profit of 1.139 billion Australian
dollars (877.03 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Warning from Managing Director Don Argus that the bank will
struggle to sustain record profit growth prompted a sell-off.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Clone Cancer-Curbing Gene </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Scientists in central China's
Hunan province have become the first in the world to clone the
entire sequence of the cancer-curbing gene Cx26 and complete an
analysis on the sequence.
</P>
<P>
The work by Professor Li Guiyuan and his colleagues in the
Hunan Medical University broadens the research of treating cancer,
experts say.
</P>
<P>
Scientists have discovered that if cancer-suppressing genes in
the human body, which can maintain the stability of the internal
working environment for cells, become inactive, normal epithelial
cells tend to turn malignant.
</P>
<P>
The Cx26 is the second type of such genes discovered, which
play the role of communication between cells.
</P>
<P>
The scientists have confirmed that once the Cx26 loses
activity, meaning that it fails to recognize communication signals
between cells, the cells may turn malignant.
</P>
<P>
The Cx26 gene has not been discovered to lose sections or
mutate, as often happens to the first type of cancer-curbing
gene. As a result, the Cx26 is more suitable for use in gene
therapy of cancers.

<HEADLINE> 300 Foreign State Leaders Visit Great Wall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The most popular section of China's
Great Wall near Beijing has been visited by 300 heads of state and
government of foreign countries since it received the Nepalese
prime minister in 1960.
</P>
<P>
President of Cote d'Ivoire Henri Konan Bedie was the 300th VIP
to Badaling Pass of the Great Wall during his stay in Beijing
early this month.
</P>
<P>
His name has joined the list with former US presidents Richard
Nixon and Ronald Reagan, former Japanese Prime Minister Kakuei
Tanaka, Queen Elizabeth II, and Russian President Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
Known in China as "the 10,000-li wall", the Great Wall
stretches 6,700 kilometers. Constructed during the Warring States
period (475-221 B.C.), the Wall was completed during the Ming
Dynasty (1368-1644).
</P>
<P>
It is one of the few man-made architectural works that can be
seen by orbiting astronauts.
</P>
<P>
Late Chinese leader Chairman Mao Zedong's saying - "if you fail
to reach the Great Wall you are not a true man" - makes the wall
more well-known both at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
Constructed on rolling hills at Beijing's Yanqing County in
1505, Badaling Pass is considered as one of the best places to see
the Great Wall.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, the Great Wall was listed in the book of world
heritage published by the United Nations Educational, Scientific
and Cultural Organization, and Badaling Pass received the honor as
the representative of the Great Wall.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that more than five million overseas tourists
came to Badaling in the past six years, including boxer Muhammad
Ali, soccer player Diego Maradona, and singer Luciano Pavarotti.
</P>
<P>
Local tourism authority has made huge investments in
construction of infrastructure and tourist facilities in the past
decade to offer better services.
</P>
<P>
An expressway linking Badaling and urban Beijing is under
construction and will be open to traffic this year.

ANKARA, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Turkish air forces today
bombarded the camps and bases of the outlawed Kurdish Workers'
Party (PKK) in northern Iraq after the 50,000-strong Turkish
troops crossed the border into the region Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
F-4 fighters first took off from the air bases in
Diyarbakir and in Erhac of Malatya province of southeastern
Turkey at 05:30 a.m. local time (02:30 GMT) and bombarded the
PKK Sinat, Hakurk, Zap, Zeli, Hafta camps in northern Iraq.
Later, Turkish Cobra armed helicopters also bombarded the PKK
camps in the region.
</P>
<P>
Sermet Atacanli, deputy spokesman of the Turkish Foreign
Ministry said Wednesday that the Turkish government troops
launched the cross-border military operations following a call for
aid by Iraq's Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) Chairman Mesud
Barzani.
</P>
<P>
The semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported today that
the PKK rebels in northern Iraq are escaping toward the
Iranian border following the bombardment of the Turkish fighters.
</P>
<P>
More than 30 PKK militants have been killed in Sarisavaklar
region of northern Iraq during the large-scale Turkish
cross-border military operations which started Wednesday morning,
said the agency.
</P>
<P>

clashed with the PKK guerrillas in Darkaracan and Begova regions
in northern Iraq Wednesday and the Turkish security forces
started to advance toward the two regions this morning.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting a separatist war for autonomy in
southeastern Turkey since August 1984. Its armed wing, based in
northern Iraq, has been waging hit-and-run battles against the
government forces from across the borders.

<HEADLINE> Private Sector Controls More Share of Egypt's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The private sector now controls
nearly 40 percent of Egypt's annual 1.8-million-tonne sugar
market, up from less than 10 percent in 1990, according to the May
issue of Egypt's Business Monthly magazine.
</P>
<P>
This is the result of the government's privatization drive
which encouraged the private sectors to play a more active role in
the trade, the magazine said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, private firms are now entirely responsible for
importing the 700,000 tonnes of sugar Egypt needs to make up for
its production deficit each year.
</P>
<P>
The government decided Sunday to sell 20 percent stake of the
shares of the Sugar and Integrated Industries Company (SIIC) at
the stock exchange, along with other giant public companies.
</P>
<P>
The sale of 7.6 million shares will make around 574 million
Egyptian pounds (169 million U.S. dollars), according to the
cabinet's Privatization Committee.
</P>
<P>
SIIC, an affiliate of the Food Industries Holding Co., has
controlled the sugar market ever since President Gamal Abdel
Nasser nationalized the holdings of sugar-magnate Abu Pasha.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the government's encouragement, a new private sugar
mill began operation in late March, two more mills will open later
and an existing private mill will double its capacity by 1998,
thus adding up to 500,000 tonnes of sugar a year in private
milling capacity, according to the monthly magazine.
</P>
<P>
Egypt needs to import about 100,000 tonnes of top quality sugar
a year to meet the demand of soft-drink makers and pharmaceutical
firms.
</P>
<P>
The new mills are expected to produce higher quality sugar to
help reduce the imports.
</P>
<P>
Sugar is considered Egypt's second most sensitive commodity
after wheat. Contrary to popular belief, Egyptians' sugar
consumption lags behind that of developed nations.
</P>
<P>
Egyptians consume 29 kilograms of sugar per person a year, much
less than the 37 kilograms of sugar per person for the
Europeans.
</P>
<P>
But still Egypt's sugar consumption will rise at a brisk 4
percent to 5 percent per year, much higher than the world annual
growth at 1.5 to 2.5 percent, the magazine said.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Military Denies Postponement of Tripartite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 15 (Xinhua) -- A high-ranking military official has
categorically rejected Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan's recent
statement on the postponement of the Turkish-Israeli-U.S. joint
naval exercises scheduled to be launched later this year.
</P>
<P>
Local newspaper Daily News today quoted this senior official
from the General Staff, who declined to be named, as saying that
the three-nation joint war games would be held later this year.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with visiting Iraqi Justice Minister Shabib
Al-Maliki on Tuesday, Erbakan said that the planned
Turkish-Israeli-U.S. military exercises had been postponed to
"some future year."
</P>
<P>
The military official said no change had been made about the
joint exercises, adding that Prime Minister Erbakan made his
statement without consulting with those involved in planning the
games.
</P>
<P>
Expressing his astonishment at such remarks, the official was
quoted by the Daily news as asking that "since when, up to now,
has the Prime Minister played a role in the decision-making
process in relations with Israel?"
</P>
<P>
The senior official told the paper that Erbakan just made this
inaccurate statement to appease those Arab nations which were
disturbed by the rapidly growing Turkish-Israeli cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The official's denial of the postponement of the war games
was later confirmed by both the foreign ministry and the defense
ministry.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to a weekly press conference here, Foreign Ministry
Deputy Spokesman Sermet Atacanli said that no information about
the postponement of the joint military exercises was obtained from
the military sources.
</P>
<P>
Describing Erbakan's remarks as "a wrong conclusion," Defense
Minister Turhan Tayan, who paid an official visit to Israel
recently, said that postponing the maneuvers was "out of the
question and preparations for the exercises will continue."
</P>
<P>
The increasingly expanding Turkish-Israeli military cooperation
has caused grave disturbance among the Arab world, which accused
Turkey of trying to form an alliance with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
However, the Turkish side has rejected such an allegation,
saying that the Turkish-Israeli-U.S. joint military drills are
just a normal search-and-rescue operation in the Mediterranean
instead of a drill directed against the Arab nations.

<HEADLINE> Party's Fine Style of Hard Work, Thrift Urged to Carry Forward (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Jiang Zemin, general secretary of
the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and state
president, called for revival of the Party's fine tradition of
hard work and thrift in an effort to end indulgence in luxury and
extravagance.
</P>
<P>
He made the call in a speech on January 29 at the Eighth
Plenary Session of the CPC Central Commission for Discipline
Inspection. The summary of his speech, which is released here
today, is as follows:
</P>
<P>
"In the course of reform and opening-up and developing the
socialist market economy, for various reasons, the Party's fine
tradition and style of hard work and thrift have faded from the
memories of quite a number of Party members and officials," Jiang
said.
</P>
<P>
"It is almost in vogue in many regions, departments and units
to go in for pomp, extravagance and lavish spending," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Some people wallow in material comforts, luxury and
dissipation," he said, "and the situation is horrifying."
</P>
<P>
Jiang enumerated six such phenomena:
</P>
<P>
-- Some leading officials go regularly to expensive
entertainment places such as luxury hotels and night clubs,
spending money like water, Some officials even gamble and visit
prostitutes, using public funds to do so. Some of the so-called
"training centers", "sanatoriums" and "local government agencies
set up in Beijing" have actually become places for wining and
dining. It is very difficult to estimate how much money has thus
wasted every year.

Too much money has been spent on buying cars and communication
equipment. During the Eighth Five-year Plan Period (1991-1995)
government departments and institutions, including some
enterprises, spent far too much money on purchasing sedan cars and
cellular phones. Some of the localities and departments could
hardly afford to pay their employees because of their strained
financial conditions, but their leading officials were all
well-equipped with cellular phones;
</P>
<P>
-- Building luxury office buildings and spending huge sums of
public funds on buying or furnishing leading officials'
residential quarters. Two responsible officials of a city's real
estate trust and investment company spent 2.7 million yuan
(325,000 US dollars) of the company buying houses for themselves,
despite the enterprise's managerial difficulties and the housing
problems of most of their employees. Luxury office buildings of
the city's party committee, people's congress and government are
being built one after another. Why on earth build such luxury
office buildings?
</P>
<P>
-- Commemorative events of every description entail the buying
of large amounts of souvenirs and gifts. Some such meetings are
completely meaningless;
</P>
<P>
- The number of meetings of every description, making no
distinction between the necessary and unnecessary, is
excessive. Most of the meetings are held in scenic resorts or
areas with pleasant climates. Very few meetings are held in the
backward northwestern province of Qinghai, for instance.
</P>
<P>
- An excessive amount of subsidies and allowances of every
description are handed out in violation of rules and stipulations.

<HEADLINE> Ingredient in Tea Said to Kill Cancer Cells </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists in central
China's Hunan Province have found that catechol, or catechin, in
tea can lead to cancer cells committing "suicide".
</P>
<P>
Among three kinds of tea which have proved to be effective in
killing cancer cells, the non-fermented green tea takes the lead,
according to the results of an experiment conducted by a student
with master degree named Zhao Yan at Hunan Medical University.
</P>
<P>
The half-fermented oolong tea and wholely-fermented black tea
can also kill cancer cells, the experiment shows.
</P>
<P>
Zhao found through the experiments on 21 kinds of tea she had
collected from China, Japan and the Republic of Korea that the
tea's effect on the cancer cells depends on its type, growing area
and processing methods, such as whether it has been fermented or
not.
</P>
<P>
The amount of catechol in tea is also vital in deciding the
effect on cancer cells, Zhao said.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that this research finding has provided a new
theory for abstracting highly effective anti-cancer drugs with
little side-effects from natural plants.  Enitem

"There are indeed some serious cases of indulging in luxury and
extravagance in the above-mentioned phenomena," the Chinese
president said. And "luxury wastes" are making inroads or ruining
the country.
</P>
<P>
On this issue, some viewpoints should be made clear, he said,
adding that "it is normal to raise the people's living standards
in the wake of economic development. We do not oppose raising
living standards and the goal of the Communists in their work is
to better people's lives.
</P>
<P>
"What we oppose is excessively-high consumption which do not
comply with the current level of economic development," he
said. "And we oppose the use of public office for private gain,
seeking private gain at public expense and harming others to
benefit oneself.
</P>
<P>
"With a vast population, a weak economic basis, few per-capita
resources and not strong enough comprehensive national strength,
China is still facing a host of difficulties and new problems on
its road of advancement, such as pressures arising from the
superior economic, scientific and technological attainment of the
Western developed nations," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We must work hard and arduously for decades or even longer in
order to achieve socialist modernization and catch up with the
level of the developed countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
"At present, China still has a rural population of 58 million
living in need, and the task of relieving poverty in the rural
areas especially is extremely arduous," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"With quite a number of state-owned enterprises operating at a
loss in production and management, millions of workers nationwide
cannot get their full salaries or get them in time," he said. "And
an increasing number of workers are becoming unemployed.
</P>
<P>
"Facing this situation, our leading organs at all levels and
leading officials and the masses of cadres should all the more
conscientiously adhere to the spirit of hard work and
thrift. There is no reason whatsoever to spend public money of the
country and people wastefully," he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang revealed that strict measures will be taken to control the
construction of new office buildings for Party and government
organizations at all levels.
</P>
<P>
"The number of meetings, such as commemorative meetings,
symposiums and press conferences will be reduced to the minimum,"
he said. "And the handing out of gifts and so-called souvenirs is
banned completely and indiscriminately from now on."

"During China's reform and opening-up drive, we should actively
introduce useful things from the developed Western countries while
avoiding citing decadent things as miraculous ones and taking
deep-rooted ulcers as treasured objects," Jiang Zemin noted.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that "in order to realize our ideals, we should
keep to giving full play to our superiority when learning good
experiences from others."
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that a society with a bare substance level does not
mean socialism, and spiritual barrenness is not socialism
either. Socialism not only enables people to enjoy an abundant
material life but also enable them to have an enriched and
colorful cultural life too.
</P>
<P>
A number of Communist Party members and officials, including
some ranking officials, he added, seek for and imitate the
decadent Western life style and abandon themselves to the worship
of money and pleasure-seeking, adding that it is very dangerous to
do so.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said, at present, even in Western countries, some
statesmen and men of insight are deeply concerned about the
unchecked spreading of "Western social diseases" such as
pleasure-seeking, spiritual degeneration and decadence.

He also urged ranking officials to adhere to the principles in
appointing to posts only those who have the spirit of hard work
and conscientious devotion to the public.
</P>
<P>
Those who are afraid of hard work, and seek pleasure and
extravagance must not be appointed to important posts, he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Jiang added that senior officials are not only required to
maintain discipline themselves, but also urged to make sure that
their spouses, children and staff enforce discipline.
</P>
<P>
The central authorities has adopted appropriate regulations,
Jiang said. He called on the discipline inspection and supervisory
organs to strengthen their supervision and ensure that officials
abide by the regulations and resolutely correct mistakes whenever
they are discovered.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Closes Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar closed lower
today as the U.S. dollar probed four-month lows against the
Japanese yen.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar ended at 77.66 U.S. cents, down from
77.84 previously.
</P>
<P>
The market was anticipating further clues from the central bank
on its thoughts on interest rate policy in light of remarks this
week by Prime Minister John Howard that the federal budget for
1997-1998 would probably not stand in the way of a rate cut, if
the Reserve Bank wanted to ease.
</P>
<P>
Later, the market lifted on remarks in federal parliament by
Deputy Prime Minister Tim Fischer, which were initially
interpreted as implying another rate cut was on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
Fischer said: "Let me point out to the House that the interest
rate reductions which have occurred under the coalition government
have saved farmers over 300 million Australian dollars (210
million U.S. dollars) already, with more to come."
</P>
<P>
As the full report of Fischer's remarks were digested the
market retraced a little to end around its closing levels.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed lower at 90.29 against the
Japanese yen from 92.58.
</P>
<P>
Against the German mark, it was at 1.3152 from 1.3264.

<HEADLINE> Singapore to Develop 1st Private Hospital in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore Technologies
Industrial Corporation (STIC), a government-linked conglomerate,
has invested 11 million U.S. dollars in a maiden health-care joint
venture to develop a first private hospital and clinics in China,
the Business Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The mainboard-listed company's health-care vehicle is
Toronto-incorporated Inter-health Canada (China) Inc. (ICCI), in
which the STIC has taken a 50 percent stake, the report said,
adding that China will be STIC's initial health-care focus.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a company spokesman was quoted as saying that ICCI
has entered into a 51:49 joint venture agreement with two Chinese
partners, including state-owned enterprise Beijing Comprehensive
Investment Co., to set up Beijing Toronto International Hospital
(BTIH).
</P>
<P>
BTIH is going to be the company that will develop Beijing's
first private hospital and a network of eight clinics in key
cities including Shanghai, Tianjin and Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
These clinics will be linked to the new hospital through
various means, including information technology and telemedicine,
it said.
</P>
<P>
The report also said that the 250-bed hospital is targeted at
the expatriate community of at least 200,000 people in Beijing as
well as high-income Chinese nationals.
</P>
<P>
The hospital, which is going to be located in the Beijing
Technological Development Area, will be built in three phases and
is expected to be completed at the end of year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Singapore OKeys Primary Listing of 1st Chinese Firm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The Stock Exchange of Singapore
(SES) has approved in principle the first primary listing of a
Chinese state enterprise on the mainboard in Singapore, local
newspapers reported today.
</P>
<P>
The approved listing of the Tianjin Zhong Xin Pharmaceutical
Corporation (TZXP), previously known as Tianjin Traditional
Chinese Medicine, is scheduled to go public here next month,
though details of the offer are not yet known, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The forthcoming public offer of the TZXP stock, called "S"
shares, will be denominated in U.S. dollars, and its public issue
will be lead-managed by the Development Bank of Singapore (DBS)
and co-managed by the Keppel Bank, the Overseas Chinese Banking
Corporation (OCBC) Bank, Overseas Union Bank (OUB), Tat Lee Bank
and the United Overseas Bank (UOB).
</P>
<P>
The pharmaceutical group was tipped widely to be the first
Chinese firm to launch a primary listing here following the
signing of a memorandum of understanding between the securities
regulatory bodies of China and Singapore in November 1995.
</P>
<P>
The Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Chinese Securities
Regulatory Commission had agreed to co-operate in the regulation
of securities and futures activities in both countries, paving the
way for Chinese companies to come to Singapore for primary listing.
</P>
<P>
The pharmaceutical group, founded in 1955, is a leading
manufacturer of Chinese traditional medicine with 221 registered
products in China.
</P>
<P>
Sales in China accounted for 93 percent of the group's
turnover, while the remaining seven percent came from exports to
Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, Europe and America.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Use Low Earth Orbit Satellite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia said today it will
consider using low earth orbit (LEO) satellite after the available
mass facilities of the Malaysia East Asia Satellite (Measat) are
fully utilized.
</P>
<P>
Energy, Telecommunications and Posts Minister Leo Moggie said
that in future LEO satellite may have its uses especially in
providing specific type of facilities which are not provided by
other satellite systems.
</P>
<P>
The LEO satellite, an example of a host of new
telecommunication systems and services, which would be emerging by
the end of this decade, would add a personal communication
capability allowing direct access from user terminals to
satellites, he said after opening the International Wireless and
Telecommunications Symposium (IWTS ' 97) at Shah Alam near here
today.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the success of his country's Multimedia Super
Corridor (MSC) would depend largely on the development of
telecommunications which he said forms the basic structure of the
whole endeavor.
</P>
<P>
He said that without wireless and telecommunications, there
would not be the MSC. MSC stretching southward from the Kuala
Lumpur city center is a 15 kilometer by 50 kilometer zone
specially designed for hi-tech development.
</P>
<P>
Two Malaysia-owned Measats were launched last year.
</P>
<P>
Participants from 35 countries and regions are attending the
three-day wireless and telecommunications symposium.

<HEADLINE> Southeast China City Developing Township Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Township enterprises have become a
big drive for economic development around Fuzhou, capital of
southeast China's Fujian Province.
</P>
<P>
The township enterprises surrounding Fuzhou saw their output
value climb from 10 billion yuan in 1992 to nearly 63 billion yuan
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Last year the enterprises contributed nearly 63 percent of the
city's industrial output value and conducted nearly 14 billion
yuan worth of exports.
</P>
<P>
The enterprises have provided jobs for the rural surplus labor,
narrowing the gap between the local urban and rural areas. Nearly
45 percent of net income of local farmers now comes from the
township enterprises.
</P>
<P>
In 1991-1995, the local township enterprises committed 220
million yuan to rural undertakings involving education, welfare,
and other public projects.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: A New Chapter in Sino-African Friendship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Li's official visit started in Zambia and ended in Tanzania,
the two countries connected by the 1,900-kilometer Chinese-built
railway, a world famous milestone of China's selfless aid to
African countries.
</P>
<P>
In past decades, China has provided a great deal of aid to
Africa with no attached political conditions, which has played an
active role in helping the African countries develop their economy.
</P>
<P>
However, China itself is also a developing country. Proceeding
from the economic development in the world, in the Africa
countries and in China, it is not suitable for it to provide
constant free aid to the others.
</P>
<P>
Li has been stressing the need to find a more effective way for
mutually benefit cooperation, to widen the areas for economic
cooperation, to turn the sincere willingness for cooperation into
reality, and to give full play to the supplementary nature of the
Sino-African economies.
</P>
<P>
Africa is abundant in natural resources, Li Peng said, that
could be used to help revitalize its economy.
</P>
<P>
Having passed the most difficult period of time, Africa is now
on the way of economic recovery and has made remarkable
achievement, he added.
</P>
<P>
All pessimistic views on the development of the African economy
are baseless, he said, adding that Africa is a continent full of
hope.
</P>
<P>
At the opening ceremony of a Sino-Zambian joint-venture textile
company, Li Peng praised the company for taking a form that is
beneficial to the development of both sides.
</P>
<P>
He proposed to speed up the economic cooperation between China
and the African countries in the form of joint ventures, and
specifically talked about how to do it in the fields of forestry,
power, textiles, pharmaceutical production and mining.
</P>
<P>
Africa is rich in natural resources and manpower while China
has the capacity of investment, technology and managing
experience, he said. China and the African countries could promote
their economic cooperation by making full use of their economic
supplementary feature.
</P>
<P>
These ideas, proved by the success of China's opening up and
reform, are the correct choice under the new circumstances, and
have been warmly received by all the leaders.
</P>
<P>
President of Gabon Albert Bongo said that his country is
willing to expand economic ties with China on the basis of
equality and mutual benefits, and stressed that the Chinese
enterprise are welcome to do business in Gabon.
</P>
<P>
Presidents of Cameroon, Zambia and Tanzania also agreed with
Li's ideas. Expressing his willingness to learn from China's
success, Zambian president Fredirick Chiluba cited an old Chinese
aphorism: Giving one fish is not as good as teaching him how to
fish.
</P>
<P>
Li's trip has achieved great results. Twenty agreements on
various projects between China and the six countries have been
signed. Undoubtedly, furthering economic ties and the traditional
friendship between China and African countries by means of more
active cooperation will be a long lasting Chinese policy.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin visited Africa last May. Only in a year,
Premier Li went to this continent again, bringing once more
the good will and best wishes from the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
"If the 20th century is the 'century of liberation' for Africa,
then the 21st century will be Africa's 'century of development.'"
Li said. This is not only the wish from Li, but also from all the
Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
Premier Li's trip to Africa will prove to be a mile stone in
the long lasting friendship and cooperation between China and the
African countries.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Threatens to Stall Trade Talks With EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 15 (Xinhua) -- South Africa has threatened
to stall trade negotiations with the European Union (EU) unless
it gets more favorable concessions on its agricultural exports,
local daily "The Citizen" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Parliament's trade and foreign affairs
committees in Cape Town on Wednesday, Trade and Industry
Ministry's Chief Director of Foreign Trade Relations, Faizel
Ismail, said South Africa was extremely concerned that 40 percent
of its trade with the EU that stood to benefit most from an
agreement on agriculture, had been excluded from a free trade
area.
</P>
<P>
Ismail revealed, Trade and Industry Minister Alec Erwin told
the EU's Director for Development Philippe Soubestre on Tuesday
that South Africa would be "seriously concerned" from going ahead
with the trade talks with any enthusiasm until it had a clear
indication of some real progress in reducing the long list of
agricultural exclusions.
</P>
<P>
He also said South Africa did not believe it had received a
satisfactory response to the issue of compensation for the
structural adjustments it would have to make before the
finalization of a free trade agreement with the EU.
</P>
<P>
The issue of the agricultural exclusions had been raised
several times in trade negotiations since the end of last year,
said Ismail, adding he hoped there would be a significant and
positive response by a planned inter-ministerial meeting went
ahead in July this year.

SHANGHAI, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The customs office of Pudong New

Chinese and foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
Under a reform scheme of the customs, these enterprises will
enjoy priorities in passing through customs and tariffs, a
spokesman of the customs said.
</P>
<P>
As a result of fast-growing foreign trade volume and with the
increasing presence of overseas-invested companies, the customs
deems it highly necessary to raise its work efficiency. This
prompted them to introduce the scheme, which is in line with
the international practice, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
As a leading city in China's economic reform and opening-up
drive, Shanghai has established over 4,800 overseas-invested
enterprises plus over 4,000 businesses funded by Chinese

<HEADLINE> Turkish President: No Army Intervention in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman Demirel
has asked the Turkish Armed Force not to intervene in the current
political tension in the country.
</P>
<P>
Demirel made the remarks on board his special plane on the way
home from Turkmenian capital Askhabad where he participated in the
Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO) summit, local newspaper
Daily News reported today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the reporters accompanying him, the Turkish
president said that he had told both Chief of General Staff Ismail
Hakki Karadayi and Islamic Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan that
the army must keep out of politics.
</P>
<P>
"Over the past three months, I made six speeches on TV and
tried to request from each and every one that no one should force
the military to defend itself," Demirel was quoted by the Daily
News as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We have twenty political parties. Let them discuss everything
among themselves." he added.
</P>
<P>
In recent months, political confrontation has been increasing
between the top commanders and Prime Minister Erbakan. The
military said the coalition government had became a protection
umbrella of the force which posed a serious threat to the
secularist system established by Mustafa Kemel, founder of the
Turkish Republic.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, a rally was organized in Istanbul, the largest city of
Turkey, in protest against the military-proposed uninterrupted
compulsory eight-year education.
</P>
<P>
Local media reported that the General Staff had called a
emergency meeting to discuss the latest Istanbul mass rally,
which the military said had turned into an anti-secular
demonstration because the protesters claimed the compulsory
eight-year education could lead to the closing of religious
schools.
</P>
<P>
Justifying the meeting attended by top officers, President
Demirel said that people should not be disturbed by a routine
conference in which the generals were carrying out their duties
as defenders of the republic.
</P>
<P>
Clearly wary of the rising tension, Erbakan reiterated early
this week that Turkey's secularism and democracy brooked no
change, saying Turkey was a democratic country based on the
supremacy of law.
</P>
<P>
There have been rumors that Erbakan's Welfare Party-led
coalition government had been shaken under the pressure from both
the junior coalition, True Path Party and the military.

<HEADLINE> Geographical Distribution of China's Listed Firms Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The geographical distribution of
Chinese companies listed on the stock market has seen considerable
change since 1996, analysts say, and is becoming more equitable as
more companies from less-developed areas go public.
</P>
<P>
More than 26 percent of the 603 companies listed on the
Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges are from central and western
China, eight percentage points more than at the end of 1995. Of
272 companies listed between 1996 and the end of last month, about
36 percent were from the central and western parts of the
country. The percentage of companies from developed coastal areas
has fallen from nearly 80 percent to 65.4.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that changes in the geographical distribution
indicate that China's effort to transform enterprises into
joint-stock companies has been extending from the coastal areas to
interior areas, and this development trend is good for the
balanced growth of China's regional economy.

FUZHOU, May 15 (Xinhua) -- A World Bank-financed project to
develop the red soil of east China's Fujian Province was given
high marks by a bank evaluation team recently.
</P>
<P>
The project, which began in June of 1994, covers 80 river

Among the economic benefits of the project in the past three
years have been an additional 9,000 tons of grain and an
additional 174 million yuan in output value, he said, adding that

<HEADLINE> Pak on Right Course to Settle Issues with India: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif said here today his government is set on a right course
toward resolving outstanding issues with India through dialogue.
</P>
<P>
"The initiation of dialogue with India is a good beginning
toward creating a conducive atmosphere for resolving outstanding
issues," Sharif told reporters here today.
</P>
<P>
Referring to his meeting with his Indian counterpart, I. K.
Gujral, Sharif said, "The meeting is a good step toward creating
atmosphere for dialogue in the face of tension and escalating
defense budgets between the two countries."
</P>
<P>
"The two countries need to change last 50 years stance as an
appraisal of policies will reveal that neither has gained anything
from the tension," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the Pakistani prime minister said the meeting should
not be taken to mean that all issues will be settled in no time.
</P>
<P>
"I don't claim that all problems will be solved within 24
hours, it may take months and some years to resolve all the issues
with India," Sharif said while reiterating that Kashmir is the
core issue between Pakistan and India.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Accord on Solving Bangladesh's Insurgency Problem Likely Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dhaka, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government is likely
to sign a breakthrough peace agreement soon with the tribal
insurgents in a bid to solve the 23-year-old problem in southern
Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT), official sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
However, the sources could not confirm when the agreement would
be signed.
</P>
<P>
"The tribal delegation will fly back today or tomorrow to seek
approval of their partners and before their departure, they are
expected to call on Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina," the sources
added.
</P>
<P>
President of the National Committee on CHT and Chief Whip Abul
Hasanat Abdulla in a written statement Wednesday night said, "We
have agreed to all matters, and an agreement will be signed very
soon." But he did not mention the "matters" they agreed.
</P>
<P>
"The peace talks have ended. This is the last talks in this
regard," He told pressmen, after concluding the four-day crucial
negotiations with the Parbatya Chattagram Jana Sahhati Samiti
(PCJSS), the political wing of the armed tribal rebels.
</P>
<P>
Shantu Larma, head of the PCJSS, endorsed the statement with a
big smile.
</P>
<P>
Ever since the 1970s, the independence-seeking tribal
insurgents have launched a bloody bush war, which cost thousands
of lives, in the 14,200-square-kilometer region, rich in
hydrocarbon deposits and teak.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, the PCJSS agreed with the revised
government proposal on the army's role in the Hill Tracts and the
relocation of the Bangalee settlers in the area.
</P>
<P>
It also agreed that the Shanti Bahini, the armed wing of the
PCJSS, would lay down arms while the government had agreed with
the PCJSS's proposals on constitutional recognition of the tribal
people and to give the three hill districts constitutional entity.
</P>
<P>
The agreement is expected to bring about a durable peace in the
CHT and bring back about 50,000 tribal refugees from refugee camps
in the Indian state of Tripura.
</P>
<P>
With the initiative of the present government, over 6,000
refugees have returned to their homeland.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: A New Chapter in Sino-African Friendship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Great changes have taken place in Africa since the end of the
Cold War, changes that did not estrange Africa from China, but, on
the contrary, have enabled them to cooperate more sincerely and
support each other in the international affairs more steadfastly.
</P>
<P>
China and Africa, having no conflict of interest, face the task
to develop economy, share the wide-range common interests in the
international affairs, as well as enjoy a sound basis for
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin put forward a five-point proposal during
his visit to Africa last year -- "to foster a sincere friendship,
to treat each other as equals, to seek common development on the
basis of mutual benefit, to increase consultation and to look into
the future."
</P>
<P>
Premier Li Peng has also said that "China, which was, is and
will be the friend of Africa, never seeks benefit from Africa and
selflessly provides aid to the continent without any
preconditions. China does not interfere in other country's internal
affairs and respects African peoples' own choices of social
system."
</P>
<P>
While meeting with leaders of Mozambique, Gabon and Cameroon,
Li Peng thanked them for their support on China's human rights
issue. Appreciating the six countries' "one China" policy, Li
stressed that both China and Africa should strengthen cooperation
in the fields of politics and international affairs.
</P>
<P>
Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano remembered that China did
not stop its assistance to his country even when it was in the
greatest difficulty.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian Head of State Sani Abacha said that the Sino-African
relations were built on the basis of mutual trust, understanding,
respect and benefit. China is the reliable friend of Africa.
</P>
<P>
Premier Li and his wife Zhu Lin also made close contacts with
renowned social figures and women representatives, and visited
many schools and welfare organizations.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of the Chinese government and people, they donated
items including sewing machines, computers, medicines, wheel
chairs and stationeries to their African friends.
</P>
<P>
Expressing heart-felt gratitude, the African people said these
items were badly needed in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that with its insistence on the independent
and peaceful diplomacy and the Five Principles of Peaceful
Co-existence, China is enjoying great prestige in the world and in
African people's hearts in a world that is changing rapidly.

<HEADLINE> Reuters Starts New Service for Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Reuters, the world news service,
has started a new service to provide on line financial news to
Kenyan users, the "Daily Nation" newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The service, known as Market Watch, will provide up to date
information on foreign exchange rates, commodity markets, share
prices and bond rates at the Nairobi Stock Exchange as well as
stock prices in New York and London.
</P>
<P>
The service uses Internet technology, making it available to
the widest possible audience, said the report.
</P>
<P>
It has specifically been developed for use by corporate
treasurers, finance directors, financial controllers and
subscribers with a keen interest on the financial markets.
</P>
<P>
The service was officially launched by Governor of the Central
Bank of Kenya, Micah Cheserem here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
At the opening ceremony, Cheserem urged Reuters to maintain
its high standard of reporting financial news and to be balancing
its reports to avoid sensational stories.
</P>
<P>
"The image that has been created that only bad news can be
expected from Africa should be discouraged," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said he expects that Reuters, in a good position, can help
educate local and foreign investors on the many opportunities
available in the emerging markets in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Reuters Manager for East Africa Robin Parr said that the new
service has been developed with the eastern African markets in
mind and has incorporated many requests from its existing
subscribers.
</P>
<P>
"We will also be examining the possibility of providing a
communications mechanism with the service so that users can
negotiate and transact deals with the banks quickly, secretly,
securely and efficiently," he said.

<HEADLINE> China to Play More Important Role in Asia-Pacific Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Malaysian Foreign Minister
Datuk Abdullah Bin Haji Badawi said today that China will play an
even more important role in the peace and development of
Asia-Pacific region with its rapid economic enhancement.
</P>
<P>
Badawi made the remarks here this morning in a speech at the
forum co-sponsored by the Institute of International Studies, the
China Institute of Contemporary International Relations, and the
Institute of Asia-Pacific Studies of the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences.
</P>
<P>
Badawi said: "What the Government of China is doing, is in
effect bringing peace, stability, and prosperity to the rest of
the region. It is imperative therefore that the international
community extends its cooperation to China in its economic
reforms. The long-term benefits that can be derived bilaterally,
regionally and internationally with a successful economic reform
in China can hardly be over-emphasised."
</P>
<P>
Referring to the relations between Malaysia and China and
between the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and
China, Badawi pointed out that both Malaysia and China have
repeatedly emphasised that cooperation should be pursued on the
basis of equality and mutual respect.
</P>
<P>
Badawi said: "ASEAN appreciates the generally positive momentum
in ASEAN-China relations. The dialogue between the two sides at
both the ministerial and senior officials' level on a wide range
of subjects of importance such as those reflected in the ASEAN
Regional Forum, Asia-Europe Meeting, Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation Organization, and World Trade Organization and
international trade and others have been very encouraging."
</P>
<P>
Badawi said that ASEAN looks forward to celebrating the 30th
anniversary of the founding of ASEAN in August this year, and
Malaysia welcomes that more concrete basis has emerged for
furthering ASEAN-China cooperation and friendship.
</P>
<P>
Badawi stressed that Malaysia and all other ASEAN members have
expressed support for China's entry into the WTO.
</P>
<P>
"We take China as a friend with which we can have a partnership
for peace and prosperity," he said, adding that China's diplomatic
initiatives have generally resulted in a positive development,
regionally and internationally.

<HEADLINE> 440 Ugandan Children Die of Diarrhoea Weekly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 15 (Xinhua) -- About 440 children die of
diarrhoea every week in Uganda, reported the local daily The New
Vision today.
</P>
<P>
Nathan Kenya-Mugisha, manager of Diarrhoeal Disease Control
Program was quoted as saying, the disease is more rampant at
Uganda's districts bordering with Rwanda, Zaire and Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The major reason for the disease is the people in these
districts cannot have clean water to drink and cook.
</P>
<P>
Nathan said it is difficult to construct pit latrines in these
areas which are near lakeshores and which are rocky.
</P>
<P>
For Kitgum and Gulu, he said, the problem is caused by lack of
water for hundreds of displaced people. He said the children die
mainly due to loss of water in the body.

<HEADLINE> Peres: Majority of Israeli People Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The majority of the Israeli
people now agree to the idea of establishing an independent
Palestinian state, said Shimon Peres, opposition leader and former
prime minister, according to the state-run Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
Peres made the statement when he was addressing a Socialist
International meeting in the West Bank city of Ramallah Wednesday
night. More than 20 members of the organization were present
at the meeting, the first ever held in the Palestinian territory.
</P>
<P>
President of the Palestinian National Authority Yasser Arafat
attended the meeting. Visiting Norwegian Foreign Minister Bjoern
Godal was also present.
</P>
<P>
Peres noted that his conclusion is well founded by a recent
poll, referring to the one conducted by the Tel Aviv-based
prestigious Jafee Center for Strategic Studies.
</P>
<P>
According to the poll, which was released on April 28, 51
percent of the Israelis polled said Israel should agree to the
establishment of a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip in the context of a peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
This shows that the majority of the Israeli people hope to see
that the stalled peace process will resume and go ahead, said
Peres.
</P>
<P>
The Nobel peace prize winner pledged that he will do whatever
he can to push the rightwing Likud government to move along the
road to peace.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Party convention, held in Tel Aviv Wednesday,
adopted a platform plank recognizing the Palestinian people's
right to self-determination and for the first time agreeing to
the establishment of an independent Palestinian state.

<HEADLINE> Zambian President Assures Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick Chiluba
has told foreign and local investors that his government will not
reverse its economic and political policies so as to ensure
continued economic stability in the country, local press reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba made the commitment while opening the Zambia
investment opportunities conference here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said, "you can feel assured of the robustness and
sustainability of our policies. You can put your money into this
country with the full knowledge that this government is fully
committed to the role of the private sector and to sensible
economic policies which gives energy to the private sector."
</P>
<P>
Chiluba told more than 400 businessmen from 15 countries
taking part in the conference that despite having a small market
of 10 million people which most large investors consider a
disadvantage, Zambia has an added advantage as it is a member of
two regional groupings, the Southern African Development
Community (SADC) and the Common Market for Eastern and Southern
Africa (COMESA), with a market in excess of 300 million people
spread out in 20 countries.
</P>
<P>
Zambia is making efforts to attract investors to explore its
rich natural and human resources. Many policies and measures have
been adopted as incentives to boost economic development.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: A New Chapter in Sino-African Friendship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng wound up on
Wednesday his fruitful official good-will visit to Zambia,
Mozambique, Gabon, Cameroon, Nigeria and Tanzania, and a working
visit to Seychelles.
</P>
<P>
This was Li's fourth visit to Africa, but the first one to
these seven countries.
</P>
<P>
During his stay on the continent from May 3 to 14, Li held
meetings and talks with leaders of the seven nations on a wide
range of topics and reached common understanding with them on many
important issues.
</P>
<P>
It was a trip of peace aimed to deepen mutual understanding and
promote traditional friendship, and a successful trip to seek
mutually beneficial cooperation and common development.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese premier was warmly greeted by his African hosts who
spoke highly and vividly of the Sino-African relationship.
</P>
<P>
"Zambian-Chinese friendship has stood the test of history, and
the two countries have become 'all-weather friends,'" Zambian
President Frederick Chiluba told Li on May 5 on the first leg of
his official good-will visit.
</P>
<P>
For the Chinese people, the distant African continent is both
familiar and unfamiliar.
</P>
<P>
During the 1950s and 1960s when the tide of independence swept
the poverty-stricken African continent, the Chinese government and
people rendered great support to the Africans in their struggle
for national independence and liberation.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people and the African people have since become
true friends standing together through storm and stress, because
they have shared similar experiences, and China's support has
always been sincere.
</P>
<P>
As a Chinese saying goes, "A bosom friend afar brings a distant
land near." Since then, China and Africa have supported each
other, and developing friendship and cooperation with Africa has
become a foundation of China's foreign policy for generations.
</P>
<P>
During the past 30 years, three Chinese presidents and three
premiers have visited some 30 African countries on ten
occasions. They include the late Premier Zhou Enlai's ten-nation
tour between December 1963 and January 1964, and President Jiang
Zemin's visit of six countries in 1996.
</P>
<P>
On their part, more than 100 heads of state and government from
nearly 50 African nations have visited China for about 200 times.
</P>
<P>
Such frequent exchanges of leaders have vigorously propelled
their mutual understanding, trust and cooperation.

<HEADLINE> More Chinese Export Manufacturers Get ISO9000 Certificates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, May 15 (Xinhua) --Qinghai Measurement and Cutting Tools
Plant in northwest China has been given a certificate for meeting
ISO9000 quality standards, which is considered as a "passport" for
businesses to compete on international market.
</P>
<P>
The plant is the first export-oriented enterprise that has been
given such a certificate in this remote Chinese province.
</P>
<P>
ISO9000 quality standards were worked out by the International
Standardization Organization (ISO) in 1987 in light of modern
management theories on quality control.
</P>
<P>
The ISO9000 quality standard certificate has now become a
guarantee of good product quality, trustworthiness, and modern
management.
</P>
<P>
Qinghai Measurement and Cutting Tools Plant produces 58 kinds
of products in 630 specifications which are selling well in more
than a score of countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
The plant has also established cooperative ties with
counterpart manufacturing enterprises in a number of countries. It
turned in 3.3 million yuan of pre-tax profits and earned two
million U.S. dollars (one U.S. dollar equals to 8.3 Chinese yuan)
from exports last year.
</P>
<P>
Qinghai Province established a working committee in charge of
export-oriented enterprise quality systems in 1993 which did much
to publicize standards of the ISO quality system.
</P>
<P>
The province, together with Shaanxi and Gansu provinces, and
Ningxia Hui and Xinjiang Uygur autonomous regions, also jointly
founded the "China Northwest Assessment Center for Quality System
of Export Manufacturers" in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Heat Beats Brings Series to 3-2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Voshon Lenard scored 21 points to
help the Miami Heat secore a 96-81 victory over the New York
Knicks in the Eastern Conference semifinal series on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The win brought Miami to a 3-2 behind in the best-of-seven
series.
</P>
<P>
It was one of the ugliest playoff games that four players were
ejected, including three Knicks, who left under a shower of debris
from the Miami Arena crowd.
</P>
<P>
Game Six is Friday in New York as Miami tries to become just
the sixth team in NBA history to overcome a 3-1 deficit.
</P>
<P>
The winner faces Chicago in the conference finals.
</P>
<P>
Miami's P.J. Brown had 18 points and 12 rebounds before he was
ejected with 1:53 to play. Brown flipped Knicks guard Charlie Ward
out of bounds, bringing players from both teams onto the
court. There was plenty of shoving before order was restored.
</P>
<P>
John Starks scored 21 points off the bench and Patrick Ewing
added 15 for the Knicks, who became the first team to allow 90
points in the series.
</P>
<P>
Tempers have been simmering all series and finally boiled over.
</P>
<P>
It began in the third quarter, with Starks pounding his chest
and shouting at Heat players. With 1:55 to play in the fourth and
the Heat in control, there was a shoving match between Alonzo
Mourning and Knicks forward Charles Oakley, who was ejected.
</P>
<P>
Brown and Knicks guard Chris Childs exchanged words and a foul
stopped play two seconds later. On Hardaway's second foul shot,
Brown picked up Ward and flipped him head-over-heels into the
photographers along the baseline. Brown, Ward and Starks all were
ejected.
</P>
<P>
The league is expected to review the tape of the incident,
which could lead to suspensions.
</P>
<P>
Hardaway shot just 3-of-17 from the field but scored 16
points. Mourning added 13 on 4-of-12 shooting, but the Heat held a
42-31 edge in rebounds.
</P>
<P>
Allan Houston scored 15 points for the Knicks, who were 3-of-14
from three-point range and committed 21 turnovers.

<HEADLINE> Ample Rainfall Relieves Hebei's Heavy Drought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, May 15 (Xinhua) -- An unprecedented rainfall has
relieved the serious drought in Hebei, a major agricultural
province in north China.
</P>
<P>
According to provincial meteorological departments, moderate
rainfall has battered Hebei on seven occasions since late
February. And some areas have reported record amounts of rainfall.
</P>
<P>
Hebei is one of the country's major suppliers of grain and
cotton. However, the province's agriculture has been plagued with
chronic drought year after year.
</P>
<P>
Last year, a severe flood hit the middle and southern part of
the province. The flood, while devastating in nature, left behind
some good effects for this year -- it provided good moist
conditions for the soil, said Zang Jiansheng, director of the
provincial meteorological bureau.
</P>
<P>
However, some experts worry that the record rainfall this
spring may mean more heavy rainfall in the summer, resulting in
major flooding.

<HEADLINE> New Changes Proposed to Two HK Ordinances </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The Chief Executive's Office of
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) today
published a revised package of amendments to the Public Order
Ordinance and the Societies Ordinance, noting that these changes
will be put before the legislators this weekend.
</P>
<P>
Michael Suen, secretary for policy coordination under the Chief

Executive Office, told a press conference that the revised
amendments to the two ordinances were made public after public
consultation and careful analysis of the views expressed.
</P>
<P>
"During the consultation, the public have expressed support for
the three fundamental principles underlying the proposed
amendments to the two ordinances," he said.
</P>
<P>
The three principles are "first, there has to be a proper
balance between civil liberties and social order; second, we must
uphold the Basic Law and the International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights as they are applied to Hong Kong; and third, we
should guard against interference by foreign political forces in
local political activities."
</P>
<P>
He said, "We have listened carefully to public opinions on the
consultation document and have taken positive steps to address the
concerns expressed."
</P>
<P>
In early April, the office issued a consultation document to
solicit opinions and suggestions from the communities on its
proposals on the amendments to the two ordinances.
</P>
<P>
The proposals were made by the office in line with the
resolution of the Standing Committee of China's National People's
Congress that major amendments to the two ordinances introduced in
1992 and 1995 respectively shall not be adopted as the laws of the
HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
Responding to reporters' questions, Suen said that a total of
11 amendments have been introduced to the original proposals. For
example, "national security" will be clearly defined in the law to
refer to "the safeguarding of the territorial integrity and the
independence of the People's Republic of China.'"
</P>
<P>
"The prohibition on foreign donations will now be restricted to
'direct or indirect financial contributions from foreign political
organizations' only with the removal of the references to 'aliens'
and 'foreign organizations'," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The financial contributions from political organizations in
Taiwan will be provided for separately in the law," Suen added.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the proposals "only advocate the orderly
management and operation of societies," "aim at striking a proper
balance between civil liberties and social order," and "guard
against interference by foreign political forces in local
political activities."
</P>
<P>
"The Chief Executive and the HKSAR Executive Council are firmly
committed to safeguarding individual rights and freedoms which
Hong Kong currently enjoys," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
During the three-week consultation, the Chief Executive's
Office received a total of 5,507 written submissions, of which
4,744 are standard letters of one from or another, Suen said,
noting that groups and organizations accounted for 932 of the
submissions, and the remaining 4,575 submissions came from
individuals.
</P>
<P>
He said that these proposals are contained in the Societies
(Amendment) Bill 1997 and Public Order (Amendment) Bill 1997,
which will be introduced into the Provisional Legislative Council
on May 17, 1997.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Holds Exhibition on Hong Kong's Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 14 (Xinhua) -- A photo exhibition called Hong
Kong Returns to Motherland was opened today at the National
Archives here.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 people attended the opening ceremony which was
inaugurated by Yugoslav Deputy Prime Mimister Nikola Sainovic.
</P>
<P>
Sainovic said that the return of Hong Kong to the motherland is
a great historic event not only significant to Hong Kong and
China, but also to the development of relations between China and
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
He also congratulated China on Hong Kong's return and praised
the efforts by the Chinese government, saying "The settlement of
Hong Kong issue proves the correctness of China's foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
Speaking highly of Deng Xiaoping's concept of "one country, two
systems", Director of Yugoslav National Archives Popovic said that
the first implementation of the concept (return of Hong Kong to
the motherland) in the world is China's first step on its way to
peaceful reunification of the whole country and a good example for
peaceful solution to many international problems and issues left
over from history.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the return of Hong Kong to the motherland
is of immediate concern to not only Hong Kong and China, but also
the Asia-Pacific region and the world as a whole.
</P>
<P>
The return of Hong Kong creates favorable conditions for
further stability, prosperity and development of this trade and
financial center in the world.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Ambassador to Yugoslavia Zhu Ankong said that the
return of Hong Kong to the motherland is an important event in the
modern history of both China and the world. This does not only
mark the end of an old age and the beginning of a new era, but
also a crucial step toward the reunification of China.
</P>
<P>
He believed that Hong Kong will become more prosperous and
stable, which will help promote the economic development and
cooperation in the world.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition of 100 photos shows the history of Hong Kong and
the Chinese people's struggle as well as the Chinese government's
efforts to resume the exercise of sovereignty over the region.

<HEADLINE> Israeli-Palestinian Informal Meeting Makes No </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 15 (Xinhua) -- No breakthrough was achieved at
the meeting held overnight between Israeli and Palestinian
officials, which was arranged by U.S. peace envoy Dennis Ross.
</P>
<P>
The three-way meeting at the residence of U.S. Ambassador
Martin Indyk in Herzliya was attended by Israeli Defense
Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu's
senior adviser Yitzhak Molcho, and Palestinian senior negotiators
Saeb Erekat and Nabil Shaath.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time that Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators sat down together to discuss their differences
since Israel began in late March the controversial Har Homa
construction in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Before the meeting, Erekat hosted Ross in his hometown of
Jericho, where they discussed their positions.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to Israel Radio after the talks, Erekat said that
although the three-hour meeting was "candid and right to the
point," no clear-cut results were achieved on bridging the wide
gap between the sides.
</P>
<P>
"After the talks, I realize the magnitude of the crisis,"
Erekat said, adding "We are still in a major, major crisis."
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side still demanded that Israel freeze the
settlement expansion, including the Har Homa project. Erekat
said there would be no reinstatement of credibility of the peace
process if Israel continued the settlement activities.
</P>
<P>
Erekat viewed the meeting as simply a dialogue instead of
negotiations. He said that the Americans listened to the
opinions of both sides and Ross would take the issues to both
Israeli and Palestinian leaders today.
</P>
<P>
Ross is due to return to Washington Friday after holding
further talks separately with Netanyahu and Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat today.
</P>
<P>
Ross arrived here last Wednesday on another mediation mission
aimed at breaking the deadlock in the Israeli-Palestinian peace
talks, which have been suspended since Israel began the Har Homa
construction late March.
</P>
<P>
While the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) insists on a
freeze to Israel's settlement expansion as the precondition for
resuming talks, Israel has imposed its own conditions by
demanding the PNA fight terrorism.

MANILA, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos

<TEXT>
<P>
PUSAN, May 15 (Xinhua) -- South Korean city Taegu is bidding for
the 2001 World University Games.
</P>
<P>
The city, famous for its apples and South Korea's textile industry,
expects their bid and host for the games will be a launching pad to
its rise as an international city.
</P>
<P>
Taegu decided to bid for the games in October 1995. After a survey
of the facilities in early 1996, the South Korean government gave a
green light to the city, which was followed by the establishment of
Taegu bidding committee.
</P>
<P>
The Taegu city submitted its application to the International
University Sports Federation (FISU) this month and FISU will decide
the host city before August this year.
</P>
<P>
According to the bidding committee, Taegu will build a 70,140-seat
main stadium, swimming pool, tennis courts, gymnasium and baseball
park for the games if the city was selected as the host.
</P>
<P>
The main stadium, with construction beginning in July, is also
expected to be used as one of the sites for 2002 World Cup soccer
finals.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Seeks Herbal Therapy for Drug Addiction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Vietnamese researchers are working
with their U.S. counterparts to study the global application of a
herbal therapy for drug addiction, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The eight-month project, with 500,000 U.S. dollars funding from
the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), aims to establish
conditions for the safe and effective use of the therapy.
</P>
<P>
The new ray of hope for a cure for drug addiction lies in a
medication known as Heantos, which is composed of a number of
herbal plants and other ingredients found in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
The experimental therapy has been in use in Vietnam since 1991
to treat about 3,000 people suffering various degrees of
addiction, and initial results are encouraging.
</P>
<P>
However, health officials said, the claimed success rate needs
to be reviewed, verified and substantiated in compliance with
international scientific standards.
</P>
<P>
If the ongoing research project is fruitful, the extended use
of Heantos could reduce the cost of treating people around the
world for drug addiction.
</P>
<P>
According to published reports, in Vietnam alone, there are now
about 185,000 drug addicts, including an increasing number of
people using heroin.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Bilateral discussions between
Indonesia and Britain for the purchase of 18 more Hawk-100
trainers and Hawk-200 all-weather attack fighters will not be
hampered by the change in the British government, a senior
official said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after the official handover of eight Hawk-100s and 16
Hawk-200s to the Indonesian air force at the Simpang Tiga airbase
in Riau province on Wednesday, Minister of Defense and Security
Edi Sudradjat said the Hawk fighters are the "most appropriate
choice." "The political change in Britain will not affect our
negotiations for an additional purchase of 18 Hawk-100 and
Hawk-200s," reports reaching here today from Pekanbaru, Riau
province, quoted the minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations for the purchase of the British-made jet fighters
started in 1991, while the deal was signed in 1993 with a total
contract of 442.5 million pound sterling.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has also purchased 12 F-16 Falcon fighters from the
United States and several F-5 Tigers, all of which are stationed
in East Java's Madiun and Jakarta's Halim Perdanakusuma airbases.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia plans to buy 12 more F-16s, which the U.S. put up for

<HEADLINE> Russian-NATO Agreement Binding, Says Yeltsin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin said
today that the agreement reached in Moscow Wednesday on
Russian-North Atlantic Treaty Organization relations would be
binding.
</P>
<P>
In a televised interview tonight, Yeltsin said that under the
draft document, NATO could "make decisions only after consensus is
reached through consultations (with Russia).
</P>
<P>
"This is vitally important," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said NATO "will not station nuclear weapons" and use
military facilities left over by the former Warsaw Pact
Organization on the territories of its new members.
</P>
<P>
"Since (the document says) military forces won't be placed on
the territory of new members, then military forces won't be placed
there. Nuclear weapons won't be placed there," Yeltsin told
Russian Television.
</P>
<P>
He said: "As we declared before, we are against the expansion."
</P>
<P>
Russia and NATO had tough negotiations before, as the military
alliance "didn't want to make any commitments," he said. "But in
this document, there are precise commitments."
</P>
<P>
But United States officials said the agreement would create a
formal joint cooperation council and give Russia a voice, not
veto, in NATO decision-making on European security, reports said.
</P>
<P>
And NATO officials said the document contained no pledge about
nuclear forces and merely reaffirmed NATO's statement that it had
"no intention, no reason and no plan" to deploy nuclear weapons in
the territories of new members.
</P>
<P>
On the union treaty between Russia and Belarus, Yeltsin said 80
percent of Russians agreed to have a Russian-Belarussian union.
</P>
<P>
He would examine the draft treaty with Belarussian President
Alexander Lukashenko on May 22 before officially signing it the
following day.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the peace deal signed on Monday with Chechen
rebels, he said the accord "ended 400-year-long disputes between
the two sides."

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Continue Privatizing State Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government will
continue its policy of privatizing a number of state-owned
companies in order to strengthen their capital structure and
enhance their performance, a senior official said.
</P>
<P>
"Yet, privatization should not necessarily mean a transfer of
part or all government assets to the private sector. In essence it
comprises all efforts by involving the private sector in the
managing of state companies," Minister/State Secretary Moerdiono
said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a ceremony for the installation of a new deputy
chief for administration at the State Audit Board, Moerdiono said,
"of the various restructuring possibilities, 'going public' was
the best alternative," officials at the ceremony today quoted the
state secretary as saying.
</P>
<P>
State companies, meanwhile, will continue to play an important
role in running the national economy in the years to come, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Their contributions to the state, among other things, are in
the form of dividends, overall development funds, government share
of the profit as shareholder," Moerdiono noted.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that the total amount of the state companies'
contribution to the state for 1995 reached 1.19 trillion rupiah
(500 million U.S. dollars). In addition to this are the income tax
revenues totaling 3.1 trillion rupiah (1.302 billion U.S.
dollars), he added.

<P>
HAIKOU, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Hainan Province has become China's
biggest grower of tropical agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
On the island province, fruit- and vegetable-growing areas have
risen from 109,000 ha. in 1990 to 237,000 ha. in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The new plantings helped the province bring in nearly 6.9
billion yuan in output value of tropical agricultural products in
1996, compared with nearly 2.4 billion yuan in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 70 percent of the local output of winter fruits and
vegetables are shipped to the mainland. The nearly 500 country
trade fairs scattered throughout the province handled three
billion yuan in trade volume in 1996, a big leap from 768 million
yuan in 1987.
</P>
<P>
The province now boasts 36,000 vehicles for farm use and more
than 6,000 heavy-duty trucks, helping transport the local products
to the market. It also has more than 700 agricultural products
processing enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Hainan has so far attracted 150 million US dollars from
overseas to fund 250 local agricultural projects.
</P>
<P>
Hainan has witnessed an annual 10 percent of growth in local
agricultural output value and five percent of growth in grain
output since 1988, when the island was promoted to be provincial
status.

<HEADLINE> Fetal Skin Crafts Promise New Clues To Healing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Human fetal skin had been grafted
on to unborn sheep in experiments which may give surgeons new
clues on wound healing, a conference was told today.
</P>
<P>
Plastic surgeon Morris Ritz, of Melbourne's Austin Hospital and
Bernard O'Brien Microsurgery Research Center, has grafted skin
from spontaneously aborted human fetuses on to lambs' skin.
</P>
<P>
The human skin successfully attached to the lamb skin in two
out of four experiments, the Royal Australasian College of
Surgeons annual scientific congress, held in Brisbane, was told.
</P>
<P>
The research aims to provide a new way of studying how wounds
heal in the womb, the Australian Association Press reported.
</P>
<P>
It already is known that in the fetal environment wounds heal
almost "scarlessly" and more quickly than those suffered by humans
outside the womb.
</P>
<P>
The research may also be of benefit in fetal surgery, which is
rarely performed but has been done to save the life of unborn
babies.
</P>
<P>
Dr Ritz said his cross-species grafting technique worked
because the procedure was done early, before the lamb's immune
system had developed to the extent that it would reject the human
skin.
</P>
<P>
The next step would be to deliberately wound the skin and
observe its healing process, he said.

a disputed border.
</P>

A Peruvian military statement said a heavily armed Ecuadorean
patrol was arrested on Tuesday while planting mines six kilometers
inside Peru's territory. It added that it was only a border
incident and no clashes happened between the two armies.
</P>
<P>
The arrests came as negotiators from Lima and Quito began a
second round of talks in the Brazilian capital, Brasilia, on a
permanent solution to the decades-old border dispute.
</P>
<P>
Ecuador's Defense Ministry issued a communique today saying
seven soldiers were illegally arrested while carrying out normal

</P>
<P>
The arrested soldiers would be handed over to the Ecuadorean
authorities soon, said Peruvian military sources.

<HEADLINE> Penguins Infected By Chicken Virus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Antarctic penguins have been
infected by the chicken virus, one of the most resistant bird
viruses known to science, posing a potentially massive threat to
the continent's most famous wildlife, Australian researchers
announced here today.
</P>
<P>
No clinical disease was evident in the penguins, further
investigation was warranted, the researchers said.
</P>
<P>
Antarctic biologists have long feared the escape of chicken
viruses and have imposed strict regulations on visitors to the
continent including a ban on the consumption of chicken products
outside bases or the disposal of chicken waste.
</P>
<P>
The scientists fear that carelessness may have allowed the
disease, which affects chicks, to be brought to the white
continent by human visitors.
</P>
<P>
The highly contagious Infectious Bursal Disease Virus (INDV) is
known to cause immune deficiency and sometimes death in young
poultry.
</P>
<P>
The Australian government reacted swiftly, announcing a
workshop would look at monitoring program and ways of responding
to possible disease outbreaks.
</P>
<P>
The penguins with the anti-bodies were all found near
Australia's Mawson Station.
</P>
<P>
Dr Heather Gardner with the Australian Antarctic Division, one
of the researchers involved in the study, said up to 65 percent of
emperor penguin chicks studied had virus anti-bodies.
</P>
<P>
The researchers tested 53 emperor penguin chicks and 133 adult
Adelie penguins at three sites 40 km to 60 km from Mawson between
December 1995 and February last year.

<HEADLINE> Hard Day for Thailand's Foreign Exchange, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's foreign exchange and
stock markets were dealt further blows when speculation endangered
the Thai currency.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's speculative attack on the baht was in part blamed
on reports concerning Deputy Prime Minister and concurrently
Finance Minister Amnuay Virawan possibly being forced to leave the
government to take responsibility for failing to revive the Thai
economy.
</P>
<P>
The official mid-rate of the Thai currency, baht, was fixed at
25.86 baht to the US dollar on Wednesday, but the market rate,
spurred by heavy speculation about a possible devaluation of the
baht and the possible resignation of Finance Minister Amnuay
Virawan, soared to as high as 26.35 baht, 49 satangs higher than
the mid rate.
</P>
<P>
Theoretically, the Thai central bank allows only a four-satang
trading bandwidth, two satangs above or below the mid-rate.
</P>
<P>
In Singapore, the Bank of Thailand joined hands with the
Monetary Authority of Singapore to fend off a heavy speculative
attack on the baht.
</P>
<P>
The intervention reportedly took place in the afternoon,
following the baht fell to its lowest level against the dollar in
more than 11 years.
</P>
<P>
The joint intervention helped the baht to rebound to
26.11-26.14 baht per dollar, according to dealers.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the heavy decline in the baht's value provided an
unwelcome challenge to Thailand's coalition government to show its
ability to revive the economy.
</P>
<P>
Confidence in the Thai economy has been battered over the past
two years by a slowdown in export growth, the massive current
account deficit and slumps in both the stock and property markets.
</P>
<P>
On the stock exchange market, the Stock Exchange of Thailand
(SET) index tumbled 4.82 percent, or 28.94 points, on Wednesday to
close at 571.30, the lowest level since the end of 1991.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark index has lost 260.27 points, or 31.3 percent,
since the beginning of this year, and almost 60 percent in two
years.

<HEADLINE> Italy to Call Conference on Albania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Italy plans to call an international
conference on Albania on June 18, Italian Foreign Undersecretary
Piero Fassino told a meeting today.
</P>
<P>
The proposed conference, to take place here 11 days before
Albania's scheduled elections on June 29, will be preceded by a
preparatory session on May 26, Fassino said.
</P>
<P>
The decision to call a conference was announced at a meeting
here of the Multinational Protection Force (MPF) for Albania, in
which neighboring Italy plays a leadership role.
</P>
<P>
It came one day after Albanian President Sali Berisha's
Democratic Party threw the pre-election process into turmoil by
forcing an electoral law through the parliament on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The legislation by the Democrat-dominated Albanian parliament
was against the wishes of the tiny Balkan nation's other political
parties, including Premier Bashkim Fino's Socialist Party.
</P>
<P>
It spurred calls from the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the United States that Berisha
should reconsider and renew efforts to compromise on the law.
</P>
<P>
Fassino stressed that Fino's national unity government,
grudgingly endorsed by Berisha in March after violence and chaos
gripped the country, was "essential" to restoring normality there.
</P>
<P>
Opposition parties in Albania, who threatened to boycott the
elections as they did during the ballot last year, said today they
would consult with Fino and OSCE envoy Franz Vranitzky to frame a
response.

<HEADLINE> China Has 666 Cities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The number of Chinese cities has
risen to 666, four times as many as those 17 years ago, with the
small and medium-sized cities leading such growth.
</P>
<P>
Among the cities, 75 are large cities, 192 are medium-sized
ones and 399 are small, according to the Mayors' Association
under the Ministry of Construction.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman from the association said the flourishing Chinese
cities have accelerated China's urbanization which is moving
towards the central and western parts. The development also
conforms with the country's strategy to "bring the scale and
number of large cities under control; promote development of small
and medium-sized one and townships."
</P>
<P>
By now, the number of cities in eastern, central, and western China
respectively accounts for 44 percent, 19 percent, and 37 percent of
the national total.
</P>
<P>
China is expected to have 800 cities by the year 2000.

<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Philippine President
Fidel Ramos pledged today to boost economic ties with Panama and
said his country is willing to serve as a bridge to Asian
economies for Panama.
</P>
<P>
This was a time for Panama and the Philippines to develop
economic ties, Ramos said. He added that he wanted to invite
Panamanians to look to the Philippines as their gateway to Asia
and the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
He was sure the Philippines could serve as Panama's bridge to
the ASEAN (Association of South East Asian Nations) Free Trade
Area, which includes Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore,
Thailand and Vietnam as well as the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Ramos and his Panamanian counterpart, Ernesto Perez Balladares,
signed four trade and scientific agreements Wednesday, and a pact
making it unnecessary for diplomats from one country to get visas
to travel to the other.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement, the two presidents agreed on the
importance of putting into practice the principle of open
regionalism.
</P>
<P>
Ramos also praised Panama for the country's efforts in
combating international drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
Ramos and his delegation arrived here Tuesday for a two-day
official visit.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Hopes for Renewal of Zairean Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright today hoped the Zairean peace talks
brokered by South Africa could be renewed.
</P>
<P>
Albright made the appeal here while expressing her
disappointment at the delay of talks between Zairean President
Mobutu Sese Seko and rebel leader Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in day, Kabila refused to board a South African ship in
the Congolese port of Pointe Noire, insisting that his talks with
Mobutu should take place in international waters.
</P>
<P>
It was essential that Mobutu and Kabila get together to discuss
"some sort of peaceful transition," Albright told PBS-TV network's
"News Hour" program.
</P>
<P>
"We are very disappointed the two did not meet," she said. "It
is very important for Zaire to have a process toward an elected
government."
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns also said today
U.S. officials "encourage Mr. Kabila and President Mobutu to find
a way to speak to each other directly."
</P>
<P>
The United States feared there might be some events to happen
"if there's not an agreement to work out a peaceful transition,"
Burns said.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the 300 Americans in Zaire to leave as Kabila-led
alliance forces was only 60 kilometers away from the capital of
Kinshasa.

<HEADLINE> Upper Mekong Cooperation Moves Closer to Reality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Economic cooperation among upper
Mekong countries has moved a step closer to reality with progress
on two roads linking Thailand with Laos and South China, Poj
Indhuwongse, Thai Consul-General in Kunming, told a seminar here.
</P>
<P>
The seminar on economic cooperation among Myanmar, Laos,
Thailand and China's Yunnan province, organized by the Chinese
Studies Center at Chulalongkorn University, is taking place
Wednesday and today.
</P>
<P>
The two roads Poj was referring to were a 250-kilometer road
from Thailand's Chiang Rai via Huay Sai and Luang Namtha in Laos
to Xishuanbanna in China's Yunnan province and a 260-kilometer
route linking Huay Kon in Thailand's Nan province with the
Laotian-Chinese border.
</P>
<P>
Poj expects both roads to be completed within the next three
years allowing Thailand to tap natural resources in Yunnan, and
enabling China to use Thailand's Laem Chabang Port as an outlet
for its exports. Laos will collect toll fares from both countries.
</P>
<P>
"The development of the economic quadrangle will happen once
transportation routes are developed," he said.
</P>
<P>
Work on both roads began with the resolution of initial funding
problems. The Thai Surathip Group agreed to finance the first
route, which is being developed by a Thai mining company as part
of a joint venture with other Thai businessmen and the Laotian
government.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government agreed to help secure funds for the
Laotian section of the second road, which is also supported by the
Chamber of Commerce of Thailand's Nan province.

<P>
SANTIAGO, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The second International Forum on
"Old Age, Aging and the Community" opened here today, and will
discuss a number of important topics in its interdisciplinary
program of old age studies.
</P>
<P>
This program, established in 1995, has organized national and

<HEADLINE> Feature: Children Play Special Role in China's IDD Control Drive (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Using iodized salt is the easiest, cheapest, and the most
effective method to curb IDD," says Hou Peisen.
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, many people haven't used it out of
ignorance. Some are still lured by cheaper but unauthorized
iodine-free salt, and many others are using iodined salt
incorrectly," he notes.
</P>
<P>
IDD has emerged as a serious public health problem of China in
recent decades since about 40 percent of people who live in IDD
areas in the world are living in China, in almost every province,
municipality, and autonomous region.
</P>
<P>
"The worst thing is that about six million babies are born in
the IDD areas every year," Hou says, adding that IDD can seriously
affect development of fetus' brain and eventually do harm to human
intelligence.
</P>
<P>
"IDD prevention is vital to improving the general quality of
our children and the younger generation, and it is vital to our
country's development in the next century," says teacher Wang.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Premier Li Peng committed the country to eliminating
IDD by the year 2000 when he signed the "World Declaration for the
Survival, Protection, and Development of Children" on March, 1991.
</P>
<P>
To fulfill the goal, the Chinese government has tightened
controls over the salt-making sector to ensure iodized salt is
distributed to every corner of the country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the State Education Commission (SEC) is planning to
intensify health education among primary and middle school
students, as at Yumin Primary School, according to Liao Wenke,
chief of Hygiene and Health Education Division of SEC.
</P>
<P>
"More children and their parents will gain knowledge of IDD
control as we conduct a nationwide inspection to promote health
education this year," Liao tells Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"Backed by successful health education among Chinese people and
other measures, China will surely eliminate IDD as scheduled," Hou
Peisen says.

The first quarter figure could be slightly above or below zero
-- the picture was not yet completely clear.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Still Faces Japan's Request at WTO Panel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Japan has not withdrawn its request
for a World Trade Organization (WTO) panel meeting on the
Indonesian national car policy, a senior official said.
</P>
<P>
"I really do not know what would happen on May 23, 1997,
because Japan has not withdrawn its request," Minister of Industry
and Trade Tunky Ariwibowo said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Japan has been delaying the panel meeting scheduled for May 23,
1997, Antara news agency today quoted the minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
Japanese press reported that Japan postponed the panel meeting
on the consideration that Indonesia was busy with its general
election.
</P>
<P>
Early this month, Japan officially forwarded the car dispute to
the WTO dispute settlement board. Japan was complaining
Indonesia's national car policy which gives import and luxury tax
exemptions to a domestic car maker.
</P>
<P>
Japan, the United States and the European Union (EU) have held
a series of bilateral talks with Indonesia after lodging a
complaint with the WTO in October last year in an attempt to get
Jakarta to remove measures which the trio claim are discriminatory
and against multilateral trade rules.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, according to reports, the EU will next week ask WTO
members to set up a panel to look into Indonesia's national car
policy.
</P>
<P>
The United States has also been in consultations with Indonesia
over the policy, said the reports.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government announced its national car policy in
February last year, under the policy, domestic car makers can
enjoy tax exemption on condition they raise the local content
ratios in their cars up to 60 percent in three years.

<HEADLINE> Nepal, Bhutan to Resume Refugee Talks Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Nepal and Bhutan have agreed to
resume bilateral talks soon in order to solve the lingering
problem of Bhutanese refugees in East Nepal, press reports here
said today.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made at a Tuesday evening meeting between
Nepali Prime Minister Lokendra Bahadur Chand and Bhutanese King
Jigme Singhe Wangchuck in Maldives, where they were attending a
South Asian regional summit.
</P>
<P>
According to an official of the Nepali Foreign Ministry, the
two leaders had "useful talks in a cordial atmosphere" and had
realized the need to come to an early solution to the refugee
problem.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 100,000 Bhutanese, mostly of Nepalese origin, have been
living in eight refugee camps in eastern Nepal since 1990 when
they were forced to fled to Nepal under Bhutan's "One Nation, One
People" policy, causing severe social and employment headache for
the Nepali government.
</P>
<P>
The earlier seven rounds of bilateral talks at ministerial
level between the two Himalayan kingdoms made no progress in the
settlement of the controversial issue as Bhutan insisted that some
of the refugees were not genuine Bhutanese citizens.

<HEADLINE> Brazil: Cautious on Forming Free Trade Bloc in America </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELO HORIZONTE, Brazil, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Brazil today called
for a cautious approach toward setting up the Free Trade Area of
the Americas (FTAA) by 2005, saying the American countries should
eliminate trade barriers between them before negotiating tariff
cuts.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Third Business Forum of the Americas, Brazilian
Industry and Commerce Minister Francisco Dornelles said the
creation of the bloc cannot be speeded up because countries such
as Brazil need time to choose "a more propitious moment in the
implementation of market liberalization."
</P>
<P>
The idea contradicted the stance of the United States and
Canada, which wanted to start negotiations on all aspects of trade
liberalization at the same time, including tariff cuts.
</P>
<P>
But Dornelles acknowledged that the FTAA is an ideal that
should be pursued with the utmost effort. "Continental trade has
enormous potential for growth, as we move towards the process of
free trade," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the building of the FTAA can only be achieved with
the full participation of the business circle in the 34 countries
of America.
</P>
<P>
The forum was held parallel to the third meeting of the trade
ministers to decide the timetable for negotiations on setting up
the FTAA by 2002, which was agreed in 1994 by all the American
countries but Cuba at the Miami summit.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Philippine Defense Chief to Join Ruling Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Defense Secretary Renato
de Villa has said he would join the ruling Lakas-NUCD party before
June 30 this year in preparation for the 1998 presidential
elections.
</P>
<P>
"I was given a June 30 deadline and I intend to comply with
it," today's local press quoted de Villa as saying.
</P>
<P>
Presidential Palace insiders have intimated that newly sworn-in
Transport Secretary Ayturo Enrile would swing over to the defense
portfolio after de Villa resigns.
</P>
<P>
But earlier this year, President Fidel Ramos was criticized for
trying to keep an elder Enrile in the post of the Chief Staff of
the Armed Forces.
</P>
<P>
De Villa is believed to be one of the few people to whom
President Ramos is considering an an ointment.
</P>
<P>
In a manifesto signed last May 11, 12 provincial governors and
five city mayors in Mindanao, representing some four million
voters in the south, pledged their support for the defense chief's
presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
However, de Villa must overtake a bitter rival, House Speaker
Jose de Venecia, before becoming the party's standard-bearer in
the 1998 elections.
</P>
<P>
De Venecia also claimed that he had been assured of support by
some 3,000 Lakas-NUCD party leaders and members nationwide in his
bid to be the party's candidate.
</P>
<P>
It was still unknown whom Ramos would choose as his successor,
but the ruling party is urging him to reveal his choice no later
than November to avoid a split in the party.

<HEADLINE> Albanian PM's Visit to U.S. Hailed a Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The interim Albanian prime minister,
Bashkim Fino, returned from the United States today after a visit
hailed as a great success.
</P>
<P>
Following a chilly one-year relationship between Albania and
the U.S., Fino arrived in Washington last Saturday on a four-day
visit to seek political and economic assistance.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, he talked with U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright and representatives from the International
Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the Albanian-American foundation
for enterprises
</P>
<P>
Fino's spokesman told reporters that the U.S. government
considered the Fino-led Government of National Reconciliations the
best affiliation for overcoming the Albanian crisis.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman quoted Albright as saying that the U.S. would
fully support Fino and his government.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. would also support the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), and its special envoy to Albania,
Franz Vranitzky, in helping Albania hold new elections, Albright
was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. decided to resume the provision of 12 million
U.S. dollars for aiding Albania, which had been frozen in February
when nation-wide unrest broke out in Albania, she said.
</P>
<P>
Albright warned that the political forces which sought to
undermine the Albanian parliamentary elections scheduled for June
would be held responsible for negative results, including the
interruption of international aid.
</P>
<P>
Albania seemed on the brink of fresh turmoil on Wednesday when
Albanian President Sali Berisha's Democratic Party, which has an
overwhelming parliamentary majority, pushed through an election
law which the other eight parties in the government said favored
the Democrats.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Children Play Special Role in China's IDD Control Drive (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Mu Tong is a first-grade pupil at
Yumin Primary in Beijing, but sometimes he acts like a teacher in
the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
"You can't put salt in the pot so early!" "Please remember to
put the lid on the salt jar after you use it!" the seven-year-old
Mu Tong instructs his mother while she is stir-frying dishes.
</P>
<P>
His "teachings" on how to use salt for cooking are in fact
learned from school.
</P>
<P>
"My teachers often tell us that iodine in salt would volatilize
if you put salt in cooking pot too early or leave the salt jar
open," the boy says.
</P>
<P>
What he learns is part of a program about Iodine Deficiency
Disorders (IDD) prevention, which Chinese health and educational
departments are making efforts to make hundreds of millions of
Chinese youngsters know.
</P>
<P>
"We feel it urgent to spread the knowledge across the country
because the health of many Chinese people is endangered by the
disease while they are unaware of it," says Hou Peisen, an
official of the National Office of Endemic Diseases Control under
the Ministry of Public Health.
</P>
<P>
Hou pointed out what Mu Tong's school does in this field has
set a successful example in the country.
</P>
<P>
"We started to spread IDD prevention knowledge among students
in 1993. We encouraged them to remind their family members to use
iodized salt correctly," says Wang Xiuqin, 53, a teacher of
Chinese language in Yumin Primary School.
</P>
<P>
Helped by medical experts, they edited a pamphlet about IDD
prevention and presented many volumes to a village primary school
in north China's Chengde City, a mountainous area with a high
incidence of IDD.
</P>
<P>
The students also published an article in "China Children's
News", a national daily with a vast circulation among teenagers,
calling on their counterparts to promote the use of iodized salt,
according to the teacher.

<HEADLINE> Minor Eruptions Reported at Mexico's Popocatepetl Volcano </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The Popocatepetl volcano, 65
kilometers northeast of this Mexican capital, have erupted twice
in the past 24 hours, the National Disaster Prevention Center said.
</P>
<P>
The minor eruptions, which apparently have caused no human
injuries, occurred at 10:29 p.m. local time Tuesday and 00:40
a.m. today respectively and shot ash and rocks into the air.
</P>
<P>
They followed several latest similar eruptions taking place on
Sunday at the 5,452-meter-high volcano, which had been dormant
since 1720 but turned active in December 1994.
</P>
<P>
As explosions caused by the latest eruptions shook doors and
windows of the houses near the volcano, villagers have expressed
their concern about a future eruption.
</P>
<P>
The authorities said an alert remains effective for local
communities while state Interior Ministry personnel are visiting
the area to help those in need.
</P>
<P>
Seven million pesos (about 897,000 U.S. dollars) have been
allotted in the past two years to help secure the safety of people
living close to Popocatepetl.
</P>
<P>
The government has repaired roads and bridges, and delivered
signs indicating the routes to be followed in the event of
evacuation.
</P>
<P>
More than 10 villages have been provided with cellular phones
and have had 2,393 vehicles at their disposition for emergency
uses.

<HEADLINE> Magic Wants Jackson for Team Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The Orlando Magic have offered
Chicago Bulls' coach Phil Jackson a five-year, 30 million
U.S. dollars coaching contract, reports reaching here said on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Jackson will complete his one-year, 2.75 million U.S. dollars
deal with the Bulls by the end of this playoffs.
</P>
<P>
The Magic has reportedly wooed Jackson through his agent, Todd
Musburger, for several weeks. The club would not comment on the
offer.
</P>
<P>
The Magic also are looking at former Detroit Pistons coach
Chuck Daly, who reportedly spoke with team officials last
weekend. Daly, 66, led the Pistons to the NBA title in 1989 and
1990 but has not coached since 1994.
</P>
<P>
Orlando fired coach Brian Hill in mid-season and named
assistant Richie Adubato as his interim replacement. The Magic
finished 45-37 and lost to the Miami Heat in the first round of
the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
Chicago star Michael Jordan has said he would not return to the
Bulls without Jackson as coach. Several Chicago players said they
would not be surprised if Jackson sought another job.
</P>
<P>
Jackson hopes to guide the Bulls to their fifth title in seven
years. Only two other coaches in NBA history have surpassed his
title total. Jackson has a career record of 483-173 in his eight
seasons as Bulls coach.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEGUCIGALPA, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Honduras and El Salvador have
concluded the demarcation of the third section of their common
border under the General Peace Treaty signed in 1980.
</P>
<P>
To date, the two neighboring Central American countries have
marked off 130 kilometers of their 374.5 kilometers common border,
the Honduran Foreign Ministry announced today.
</P>
<P>
Under a ruling handed down by the International Court of
Justice in the Hague, the Netherlands, the two countries still
have 244.5 kilometers of border to be demarcated.
</P>
<P>
Oscar Villagran, chairman of El Salvador's border demarcation
committee, is here meeting his Honduran counterpart Raul Andino.
</P>
<P>
He said today both sides would speed up the demarcation process
in the sectors of the Ex-Bolsones Nahuaterique and Dolores, where
there have been serious disputes over sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Andino said Honduras was interested in getting the
work done as soon as possible although the new topography in the
Ex-Bolsones prolonged the time needed for demarcation.
</P>
<P>
The two countries are scheduled to finish establishing limits
and marking off a 97-kilometer border section by the end of this
year.

<HEADLINE> Costa Rica's Inflation Over 5 Percent in January-April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Costa Rica accumulated 5.21
percent of inflation in the first four months of this year, the
Economy Ministry said today.
</P>
<P>
The Consumer Price Index moved up 1.34 percent in April, the
second biggest monthly advance so far of the year, after January's
2.06 percent, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The transportation sector, which reported an average price hike
of five percent, was the one with the highest inflation.
</P>
<P>
Jose Leon Desanti, minister of economy, said inflation for the
year will not exceed 12 percent, namely the goal set by the
government in its commitments to international financial
institutions.
</P>
<P>
Desanti emphasized that the arrival of new foreign investment,
more credit and lower interest rates are factors likely to
contribute to the revival of the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica's economy contracted last year and has been in
depression since 1995.
</P>
<P>
While the government hopes the Central American country's
economy could grow by more than 2.5 percent this year, independent
economists see the possibility of a smaller increase.

<HEADLINE> Doctors Providing Home Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 15 (Xinhua) -- A new concept of family doctors who
treat patients in their homes and neighborhoods has been launched
in some of China's major cities, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
"Doctors and nurses in the country's more than 50,000 medium
and small-sized hospitals should boost community medical services
instead of waiting in the hospitals," said Wang Longde,
vice-minister of Public Health.
</P>
<P>
The scheme has already proved a blessing to people like Beijing
resident Zhou Guangyou, 91. When Zhou is feeling sick, instead of
travelling all the way to a hospital, he phones his community
physician Gong Guangcai.
</P>
<P>
"We have got our own family doctor," Zhou proclaimed excitedly
in a letter to his daughter who lives abroad.
</P>
<P>
Gong is one of a team of doctors at Chaoyangmen Hospital,
Beijing, who are treating 74 families in the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
As part of the new national community health drive, personal
health records will be set up to help diagnose problems as early
as possible and to initiate preventive measures.
</P>
<P>
Simple medical treatment will be available at people's
homes. Health checks will also be conducted via neighborhood
offices, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
A community medical service regulation will be issued this year
by the Ministry of Public Health to help the service which just
started in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the doctors' efforts, people will be encouraged to
be routinely vigilant in their health care rather than only
visiting doctors when they become seriously ill.
</P>
<P>
Health care knowledge can play a vital role in preventing
illnesses, including congenital malformations and obesity.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The Hanoi People's Court sentenced
eight people to death and 14 others to imprisonment in the
country's biggest drug trial on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The 22 suspects were found guilty of involvement in a
trafficking ring, which is said to have brought several hundred
kilograms of heroin into Vietnam since 1992.
</P>
<P>
Two policemen, including a former captain of the Interior
Ministry's anti-drug unit, and a border officer were among the
eight sentenced to death by the court.
</P>
<P>
Of those being sent to prison, eight were given life terms,
while the others were given jail terms of between one and 20
years, said a court source.
</P>
<P>
The case erupted following the arrest and conviction of a
Laotian drug trafficker, who broke down in 1996 shortly before he
was due to be executed and offered to exchange information on the
syndicate in exchange for leniency.
</P>
<P>
Under Vietnam's law, people sentenced to death are given a
15-day appeal period. If the appeal fails, their ultimate hopes
lie with a presidential pardon.

<HEADLINE> Background: ABCs of Basic Law of Hong Kong SAR (83-84) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Following are the ABCs of the Basic
Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (83-84) in a
question-and-answer format:
</P>
<P>
Question: Will various religious activities and missionary
schools continue after 1997?
</P>
<P>
Answer: The Basic Law stipulates, "Hong Kong residents shall
have freedom of religious belief and freedom to preach and to
conduct and participate religious activities in public."
</P>
<P>
It also stipulates, "The Government of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region shall not restrict the freedom of religious
belief, interfere in the internal affairs of religious
organizations or restrict religious activities which do not
contravene the laws of the Region. Religious organizations shall,
in accordance with law, enjoy the right to acquire, use, dispose
of and inherit property, and the right to receive financial
assistance."
</P>
<P>
Therefore, religious undertakings will continue to exist and
develop in Hong Kong after 1997.
</P>
<P>
Schools run by religious organizations account for a large
proportion of those operated by social bodies.
</P>
<P>
The Basic Law stipulates that religious organizations may,
according to their previous practice, continue to run seminaries
and other schools. Schools run by religious organizations may
continue to provide religious education including religious
courses.
</P>
<P>
Question: Will religious organizations be permitted to maintain
ties with foreign religious organizations after 1997?
</P>
<P>
Answer: Owing to historical reasons, religious organizations in
Hong Kong have maintained fairly extensive and close ties with
various countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
Out of respect for this fact, Article 141 of the Basic Law
stipulates, "Religious organizations and believers in the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region may maintain and develop their
relations with religious organizations and believers elsewhere."
</P>
<P>
Article 149 of the Basic Law also stipulates that religious
organizations in the Hong Kong SAR may maintain and develop
relations with their counterparts in foreign countries and regions
and with relevant international organizations. They may, as
required, use the name "Hong Kong, China" in relevant activities.

<HEADLINE> Anhui Boy Survives with Taiwan Donated Marrow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 15 (Xinhua) -- A 17-year-old boy from east China's
Chuzhou City, Anhui Province has survived leukaemia after a
transplant of marrow donated by a middle-aged Taiwan women.
</P>
<P>
Today's China Daily reported that the first cross-Straits
cooperation in marrow transplant was between Beijing Beitaipinglu
Hospital under the People's Liberation Army in western part of
Beijing and a marrow bank in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan woman, whose family name is Zhang, volunteered to
donate marrow for the mainland youngster after hearing the news
that the Marrow Donation Data Center in Taiwan began its search
for a donor with Liu's type of marrow.
</P>
<P>
Chen Hu, deputy director of the blood disease department of the
Beijing Beitaipinglu Hospital said the health of the boy keeps
improving and he is also under close observation by doctors in his
hospital.
</P>
<P>
Liu Jinquan's white cell count has grown from 0 to 4,400 per
cubic millimeter and the level for a healthy person is about 2,500
each cubic millimeter, said Chen, who successfully searched for
the marrow for the boy.
</P>
<P>
Liu was diagnosed with chronic granulocyte leukaemia last
August. So far, the usual cure for the disease is marrow
transplant and most of the patients underwent the surgery with
marrow offered by their family members or relatives.
</P>
<P>
As the only child in the family, Liu had to find a donor from
outside his family.
</P>
<P>
The most important step for transplant is to find the right
type of marrow. However, the odds are only one in 300,000 people.
</P>
<P>
His father had brought the boy to many big hospitals in
Shanghai, Guangzhou and Beijing, but nothing could be done due to
a lack of marrow.
</P>
<P>
The Red Cross Society of China began to promote donations of
marrow several years ago, but only 3,000 people responded.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Defense Chief Announces Task Force to Reform Pentagon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary William
Cohen today announced the formation of a task force to reform the
Pentagon for more savings.
</P>
<P>
Cohen named a panel of current and former defense officials and
outside experts to advise him on how to downsize his own office
and the military service.
</P>
<P>
"There's a great deal of redundancy in much of what we do. And
essentially, it has been growing like topsy, and we have to find
ways in which we can achieve savings," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The panel, headed by Pentagon Comptroller John Hamre, will help
the defense chief analyze Pentagon's business practices and
make suggestions, he said.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said he quickly discovered there was not enough time to
assess how the Pentagon could reduce its own bureaucracy and he
needed more time for such a review.
</P>
<P>
The United States has some 1.45 million members of the active
duty military, 813,000 civilians who work for the military
departments and the Office of the Secretary of Defense, and
another 566,000 "blue collar" support staff.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said he had no specific targets in mind for the size or
type of cuts he might propose, noting that some may require
congressional approval.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Quadrennial Defense Report, originally
scheduled for Thursday, would be made public on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The project reportedly would leave the existing military force
and military strategy largely intact, with the basic U.S. goal of
being able to fight two major regional wars simultaneously.

<HEADLINE> Money Pouring Into Flood Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Two eastern coastal provinces have
increased financial aid to their water conservation projects this
year, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
Approximately 5.7 billion yuan (868 million US dollars),
provided primarily by local governments in Jiangsu Province, has
been poured into investments in major projects, farmland capital
construction and reinforcement of dykes and dams.
</P>
<P>
Irrigation and flood-control measures will support grain
production and improve Jiangsu's ability to withstand the worst
possible water-related disasters, according to provincial
officials.
</P>
<P>
In past years, the province's government made great efforts to
spend more on water projects, itself providing 670 million yuan
(81 million US dollars), and ordering cities and counties to put 2
percent to 4 percent of their finances into water conservancy
facilities.
</P>
<P>
Irrigation projects at Taihu Lake, Wangyu River, Taipu River
and Huaihe River, are expected to be finished before the
high-water season, between late spring and early summer.
</P>
<P>
Already finished is the transformation of 78,700 hectares of
middle-and low-yield farmland.
</P>
<P>
By the end of March, nearly 900 million cubic meters of earth
and stone had been moved.
</P>
<P>
Cities and counties in Fujian Province have included
flood-control funding in their local budgets, one of several
responses to defend themselves against flood damage.
</P>
<P>
By the end of April, six cities and 23 counties had earmarked
12.45 million yuan (1.5 million US dollars) for flood-control.
</P>
<P>
Floods followed by droughts, high winds and tides, befall the
province every year, damaging the province's defences.
</P>
<P>
The damaged facilities could not be repaired in time because
the necessary funding had not been included in local budgets,
although local governments did allocate some money for repairs.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that the province will increase its
flood-control fund to 30 million yuan from 6 million yuan in the
past years.
</P>
<P>
With the growth of local economies, fund allocations are
expected to grow accordingly.

<HEADLINE> Corporate Bonds Appealing to Qinghai Individual Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Corporate bonds have proven
attractive to individual investors in northwest China's Qinghai
Province, as a recent bond offer has shown.
</P>
<P>
Some 3.5 million yuan (about 420,000 US dollars) in power
sector bonds were sold in the first two days of a 40-million-yuan
bond offer on May 10.
</P>
<P>
The bond issue was approved by the provincial planning
commission and the provincial branch of the central bank. They
have an annual interest rate of 10.2 percent, which is higher than
that of savings deposits or similar treasury bonds.
</P>
<P>
Funds from the issue will be used to finance the Lijiaxia
Hydroelectric Power Station and an expansion project on the
Qinghai Qiaotou Power Plant.
</P>
<P>
Relatively underdeveloped Qinghai is rich in power resources
but suffers from a shortage of funds.
</P>
<P>
Corporate bonds are still issued on a small scale, but have
become appealing to individual Chinese after two interest cuts
last year.

HAIKOU, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The role of China's special economic
zones as pilots in the opening up process was highlighted as the
four cities and one province attracted 6.85 billion US dollars in
overseas investment last year.
</P>

<P>
In Shenzhen and Zhuhai, in Guangdong province, overseas
investment increased by over 33 percent last year, and 100
overseas-funded enterprises in Xiamen, in Fujian province. Such
investment has also added 347 million US dollars worth of capital
to the assets in Xiamen in 1996, accounting for 21 percent of
overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
By the end of March this year, Xiamen had approved 1,391
Taiwan-funded projects, with nearly three billion US dollars of
contractual investment, and 40 percent of its industrial output

<HEADLINE> Copper Prices in China not Volatile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Copper prices in China's market
will follow fluctuations in the international market this month
with only marginal prices changes, "China Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Lower domestic prices and higher international prices will be
maintained until the demand for copper in the domestic market
surges, according to a report from Antaike Information Corp under
the China National Nonferrous Metals Industry Corp (CNNC).
</P>
<P>
China produced 211,400 tons of refined copper in the first
quarter of this year, up 9.38 percent over the corresponding
period last year, according to CNNC.
</P>
<P>
China imported 13,012 tons of refined cooper during the
January-March period, a reduction of 8.35 percent from the same
period last year, according to the customs records.
</P>
<P>
Cooper exports during the period stood at 24,061 tons, 305
percent higher than the first quarter of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed the drop in copper imports and the rises
in exports to the price differentials between the international
and China's market.
</P>
<P>
A further review of the imports and exports of the copper shows
that most imported copper is roughly processed while exported
copper is thoroughly processed, said the report.

The Australian
</P>
<P>
-- Prime Minister John Howard ruled out yesterday further
spending cuts in the 1998 budget and left open the option of
increasing the 450 Australian dollar (351 US dollar) tax rebate on
savings in the lead-up to the next election.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald
</P>
<P>
-- A leading Australian expert on savings believes the
government's new tax rebate on savings may have a negative impact
on national savings. While it should encourage more private
savings, this was unlikely to offset the scheme's 2 billion
Australian dollar (1.56 billion US dollar) cost.
</P>
<P>
The Age
</P>
<P>
-- Auditor-General Ches Baragwanath yesterday urged coalition
MPs to abandon party politics and vote against the government to
protect his office. He warned that changes to his office proposed
by the government, which would strip him of his power to directly
audit the public sector, could render parliament impotent to fight
oppression and corruption by any future government.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Financial Review
</P>
<P>
-- The budget's proposed crackdown on trading in franking
credits sent tremors through the financial services industry
yesterday. The worst-affected area of the market was trading of
options and other derivatives, which slumped as investors
attempted to assess the different role these products will have
under the new tax regime.

<HEADLINE> IBF Strips Pastrana of His Junior Flyweight Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The International Boxing
Federation Wednesday stripped Mauricio Pastrana of his junior
flyweight title for failing to attend a weigh-in for a May 10
title defense.
</P>
<P>
The Colombian was scheduled to fight Manuel Herrara in Coconut
Grove, Florida, last Saturday, but instead of turning up for
Friday's weigh-in, Pastrana sent word through a representative
that he was ill.
</P>
<P>
IBF President Bob Lee said in a news release in East Orange,
New Jersey, that the Florida Commission sent a doctor to
Pastrana's room to examine the champion and the doctor declared
him fit to fight, despite Pastrana's complaints of pain in his
testicles.
</P>
<P>
IBF rules state that a fighter must appear at a weigh-in for a
title bout unless he notifies the sanctioning body with a doctor's
certificate that he is unable to fight. When Pastrana declined to
appear, he effectively forfeited his title, the IBF said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Canada edged Olympic Sweden 2-1
and sealed a 2-1 final series victory to take its 21st world title
in the ice hockey world championship on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The victory capped a gritty comeback by the Canadians after
they had lost the first game of the best-of-three final on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Dean Evason, the only non-NHL player on the Canadian roster,
netted the only goal of the first period when he hammered home a
loose puck from the side of the Sweden net after goaltender Tommy
Salo failed to control the rebound from a shot by Owen Nolan.
</P>
<P>
Nolan added the second early in the second period when Travis
Green threaded a perfect pass through a crowd in the slot.
</P>
<P>
Michael Nylander scored a third-period reply for the Swedes.
</P>
<P>
"We knew we were going to win and they were hoping," said
Canadian coach Andy Murray.
</P>
<P>
"I told our players just before the game that right now the
Swedes are sitting in their dressing room hoping we're going to
play a bad game, hoping that Sean Burke's going to have a bad day,
that Owen Nolan isn't going to score."
</P>
<P>
The win ended a frustrating string of second-place finishes for
Canada that stretched back to the 1994 Olympics, won by Sweden in
an overtime shootout.

<HEADLINE> British Parliament Bars Sinn Fein From Opening Office </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 14 (Xinhua) -- British parliament today barred two
members of Sinn Fein, who were also newly-elected MPs, from
opening an office in parliament.
</P>
<P>
House of Commons Speaker Betty Boothroyd said Sinn Fein party
leader Gerry Adams and chief negotiator Martin McGuinness could
only use the facilities of parliament if they were prepared to be
sworn in as members, according to local reports.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein is the political wing of the Irish Republican Army
which has been fighting to end the British rule in Northern
Ireland and merge the province with the Irish republic.
</P>
<P>
Adams and McGuinness were elected parliament members in the May
1 election. They refused to take the oath of allegiance to Queen
Elizabeth but planned to maintain a parliamentary office.
</P>
<P>
Boothroyd said those who choose not to take their seats should
not have access to the many benefits and facilities now available
in this House without also taking up their responsibilities as
members.
</P>
<P>
Adams said he was not surprised by the parliament decision but
would give "a commitment to our electorate that we would not give
a nod to an English queen."
</P>
<P>
He said both he and McGuinness would be going to the British
parliament "to pick up our passes, look around the place and do a
little press work."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Sinn Fein said it would consider legal action if Adams
and McGuinness were banned from using House of Commons facilities.

<HEADLINE> CBI Responds to Queen's Speech </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The Confederation of British
Industry (CBI) today gave a favorable response to the Labor
gvernment's legislative proposals outlined in the Queen's speech.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the proposals, Adair Turner, director-general of
the CBI, said, "This is a very full program from a government
obviously keen to put into action many of its manifesto
proposals."
</P>
<P>
"It is vital that in doing so the government listens to the
views of everyone affected, so it was particularly pleasing to
hear that a positive partnership with business will be at the
heart of the government's plans," added Turner.
</P>
<P>
The CBI also welcomed the government's commitment to raising
education standards and to promoting lifelong learning in the
workplace, and its emphasis on achieving high and stable levels of
economic growth and employment.
</P>
<P>
The commitment to playing a positive role in the European Union
is one which business can strongly support, the CBI stressed.
</P>
<P>
However, the CBI said, concerns remain over plans for the
windfall tax on privatized utilities, and over the details of a
national minimum wage (NMW).
</P>
<P>
Referring to NMW, the CBI stated that it "has not been
convinced that NMW is the best way to tackle poverty, it accepts
that the government has a mandate for its introduction."
</P>
<P>
"The CBI will seek to play a constructive role in the proposed
Low Pay Commission, to ensure that the implementation of the NMW
is sensitive to the needs of the labor market and the concerns of
business," it added.

market.

The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 1.63 to

points below Monday's record.

The Nasdaq composite index rose 1.96 to 1,335.55, and the

<HEADLINE> US Dollar Plunges Toward 117 yen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar slid to another
four-month low against the yen today and fell in most other
dealings after benign inflation data raised doubts that the
Federal Reserve will lift interest rates next week.
</P>
<P>
It was the eighth straight day that the dollar fell against the
yen and left the U.S. currency 8.1 percent below its 4.5 years
intraday high of 127.47 yen set only two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
In New York, the dollar settled at 117.20 yen, down from 118.50
yen Tuesday and the lowest level since January 17. The latest
decline left the dollar barely 1 percent higher than its 1996
close of 115.93 yen.
</P>
<P>
The dollar cost 1.6944 marks in New York, down from 1.6959
Tuesday and off 2.5 percent from its 38-month high of 1.7386 marks
set on May 5. But the dollar is still 10 percent higher against
the mark compared with the end of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The pound rallied to 1.6466 U.S. dollars, up from 1.6329 U.S.
dollars, partly on trader expectations that interest rates in
Britain will rise further.
</P>
<P>
The dollar weakness intensified in U.S. trading on the decline
in April wholesale prices, the largest drop in nearly four years
and the fourth straight decrease.
</P>
<P>
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Tuesday:
1.4363 Swiss francs, down from 1.4373; 5.7055 French francs, up
from 5.7045; 1,669.00 Italian lire, down from 1,676.00; 1.3889

<HEADLINE> US Disappointed Over Failure of Zaire Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The United States expressed its
disappointment today over the failure of scheduled talks between
Zairian President Mobutu Sese Seko and rebel leader Laurent
Kabila.
</P>
<P>
Reports said Kabila refused to board a South African ship in
the Congolese port of Pointe Noire. He insisted the talks should
take place in international waters, a demand rejected by South
African President Nelson Mandela, who was to have chaired the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to Kabila's refusal, U.S. State Department spokesman
Nicholas Burns said that the United States was "very disappointed
that the talks did not take place" Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We thought the talks were necessary to establish the
conditions for an effective transition," he said.
</P>
<P>
Burns urged Mobutu and Kabila to arrange another direct talks
and hoped that dispute over the venue could be solved.
</P>
<P>
"We would encourage Mr Kabila and President Mobutu to find a
way to speak to each other directly, or else we fear for future
events ... if there's not an agreement to work out a peaceful
transition," he said.

<HEADLINE> Fire Kills 8 in Home for Retarded, Elderly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 14 (Xinhua) -- A fire engulfed a home for the
mentally retarded and elderly, in Harveys Lake, Pennsylvania,
killing eight people, authorities said today.
</P>
<P>
Firefighters worked through the early morning hours to put out
the blaze at Country Manor Personal Care, a two-story home for 21
residents aged between the mid-40s to late 90s, said Harveys Lake
Fire Chief Frank Lutinski. At least seven residents were
hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
Emergency workers returned this morning to scour the gutted
hulk for bodies and to search for the cause of the worst fire this
town of 2,700 has seen in 40 years, the Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
By mid-afternoon, they had accounted for eight victims while
one more person remained unaccounted for but was presumed dead,
Mayor Richard Boice said today.
</P>
<P>
With help from the home's staff, several escaped the burning
building shortly after the fire started around 9 p.m. Tuesday.
Firefighters pulled other people out of windows, Lutinski said,
but the flames and heat stymied the rescue effort.
</P>
<P>
Social service agencies dealing with the mentally retarded
placed most of the residents in the home, according to Jim Durso
of the Wyoming Valley Red Cross. State officials said others were
elderly who needed some help getting around.
</P>
<P>
Some Country Manor residents were bedridden, but most took care
of themselves with some help from medical staff, Lutinski said.
The home is categorized as a "personal care" home, which serves
people not badly disabled enough to need a full-service nursing
home.
</P>
<P>
The seven people admitted to hospitals included two who were
transferred to the burn center at the Lehigh Valley Medical Center
in Allentown.

<HEADLINE> S&AMP;P Raises Foreign Currency Credit Rating of Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The Standard &AMP; Poor's, the New
York-based world's leading rating company, today has raised its
foreign currency credit rating on Hong Kong to `A'-Plus from `A'
and its local currency credit rating on Hong Kong to `AA'-minus
from `A'-plus.
</P>
<P>
"The outlook is revised to stable from positive," according to
a report issued by the company today.
</P>
<P>
The company said that the upgrade is based on the improvement
in ratings of the Chinese mainland, whose incentives to respect
Hong Kong's autonomy will continue to be strong.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's new ratings also reflect the government's very
strong creditor position, with very low debt, and fiscal reserves
amounting to 12 percent of the gross domestic product this year,
it said. The government's assets of the future special
administrative region are to rise to 26 percent of GDP in 1998,
according to the company.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Hong Kong continues showing a wealthy
and dynamic economy. Its per capita income has reached about
26,000 U.S. dollars, by far the highest of any rated regions in
the single-`A' category. Its GDP growth has averaged more than 5
percent annually in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
It also said that the H.K. dollar credit rating balances a
stronger capacity to service local currency debt, due to the
government's taxation powers and control of the domestic
financial system.

<HEADLINE> Survey Shows Bright Prospects in Asia-Pacific </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Asia and the Pacific will
maintain the momentum of intensified participation in the
globalization and regionalization processes in coming years,
according to a survey prepared by the UN Economic and Social
Council.
</P>
<P>
The survey of economic and social conditions in Asia and the
Pacific, 1997, estimated that the export volume of South Asia will
increase by 7.3 percent annually over the period 1996-2005 and
that of East and South-East Asia by 10.1 percent, much higher than
the 6.3 percent annual increase worldwide.
</P>
<P>
The prospects for private financial flows appear favorable.
With moderate international interest rates and continued fiscal
consolidation in industrial countries, the consequential pressures
to diversify portfolios will favor the region because of its
higher growth prospects and the expected continuation of
liberalization and deregulation of financial sector policy
regimes.
</P>
<P>
Foreign direct investment will continue to be promoted by the
per capita incomes in developing countries of the region, which
are rising at higher rates than in the rest of the developing
world, and increasing competition in the industrial countries and
the resultant pressures on their transnational firms to locate
abroad in search of reduced production cost.
</P>
<P>
The regional cooperation in trade and investment will be
sustained and gather stronger momentum due to rising per capita
consumption, overall export growth, moderate inflation and modest
current account deficits.
</P>
<P>
The survey also noted the huge market potential in the region,
which extends to 37 percent of the world's land area and contains
62 percent of the world's population. The population with an
annual per capita income of over 10,000 dollars numbers more than
a billion in the region, far exceeding the total population of all
the developed countries, according to the survey.
