<HEADLINE> Russia, Kazakhstan Work on Caspian Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
and his visiting Kazakh counterpart, Nursultan Nazarbayev, issued
Saturday a joint statement on issues of the Caspian Sea's status
and the Baikonur cosmodrome, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
During an informal meeting held outside Moscow, the two leaders
agreed to instruct their governments to finalize a draft
convention on the Caspian Sea's status by March 15.
</P>
<P>
The draft will later be submitted to leaders of the five
Caspian littoral states -- Russia, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan,
Turkmenistan and Iran -- for further discussion.
</P>
<P>
All the five nations have claimed rights over the oil fields
and fishing grounds of the inland sea.
</P>
<P>
Also in the joint statement, Yeltsin and Nazarbayev mentioned
the planned construction of oil pipelines along the Caspian Sea.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents said that they hoped the oil pipelines would
be built as soon as possible so as to facilitate "oil
transportation from deposits in western Kazakhstan to world
markets."
</P>
<P>
As for the Baikonur, one of the largest astronautical centers,
which was left by the former Soviet Union in Kazakhstan, the two
leaders agreed that it should be operated in the interests of not
only their countries but also other member states of the
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).
</P>
<P>
Nazarbayev arrived in Moscow on Thursday for a summit with the
presidents of Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan.
</P>
<P>
During his stay here, he invited Yeltsin to pay an official
visit to Kazakhstan, and the invitation was accepted.

<HEADLINE> Arafat's Talks in Washington Negative: Palestinian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 24 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) Saturday termed as "very
negative" the outcome of Palestinian and U.S. leaders' talks in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Voice of Arabs radio,
Palestinian Minister of Planning and International Cooperation
Nabil Sha'ath was commenting on the Thursday talks between PNA
President Yasser Arafat and U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Sha'ath said that no agreement has been reached as regards the
three stages of Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank or other
issues pertaining to the transitional stage.
</P>
<P>
He attributed this to the U.S. inability to bring enough
pressure to bear on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
"The American side showed understanding and sympathy with the
Palestinian demands but it did not put any pressure on the Israeli
premier," he added.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting with Clinton, Arafat presented the Palestinian
reply to the Israeli demand of amending the Palestinian Qational
Charter that calls for destruction of the Jewish state, he said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat will make a tour of Britain, Mauritania and Tunisia to
brief the leaders of these states on the outcome of the Washington
talks, he said.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the tour, Arafat will visit Cairo for talks with
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on the coming Arab drive to save
the peace process, he added.
</P>
<P>
In Washington, the Israelis and the Palestinians remained at
apart Friday on key issues holding up peacemaking despite
week-long top-level meetings with U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu rejected Clinton's proposed scope for a gradual
Israeli pullback from the West Bank as too much while Palestinians
viewed it as not nearly enough, according to a top negotiator of
the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO).
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials have vowed to go ahead with settlement
building in the West Bank despite U.S. calls for a
"time-out".

<P>
BEIJING, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Senior Chinese leaders today
visited university teachers and family members of late Chinese
model workers here in Beijing prior to China's longest traditional
holiday, the Spring festival which falls on January 28.
</P>
<P>
In calling on some family members of two late Beijing model
workers, Wei Jianxing, member of the Standing Committee of the
Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee
and President of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, paid
tribute to them on behalf of the Party, Government and the
federation.
</P>

<HEADLINE> UK Growth at Lowest for Two And A Half Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 24 (Xinhua) - Britain's economy has fallen to
its lowest rate of growth for two and half years in the final
quarter of 1997, according to the latest official figures.
</P>
<P>
The economy grew by just 0.5% in the last four months of 1997.
Comparing with 0.8 and 1.1% growth in the previous two quarters
and is the lowest quarterly figure since the spring of 1995, said
the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said the five interest rate rises since the Labor
came to power last May had slowed the economy down more quickly
than the Bank of England had anticipated.
</P>
<P>
Andrew Roberts, at Union Bank of Switzerland based here, said
there was no longer any doubt the economy is slowing.
</P>
<P>
"If the Bank of England's monetary policy committee does not
raise rates at the next meeting, this probably means we have seen
the end of the tightening cycle," he added.
</P>
<P>
It is commonly believed here that the growth slowdown gives the
committee, which is responsible for setting interest rates, the
excuse it needs to leave interest rates on hold in the near
future.
</P>
<P>
Nick Stamenkovic of DKB warned there was a danger of overkill
if the committee put up rates again in February, saying "policy is
already tight enough... they would risk tipping the economy into
recession."
</P>
<P>
DeAnne Julius, a member of the committee, said inflation
remained a problem in the Britain. "It's too early to declare that
the battle against inflation is over, and that now the chief enemy
is deflation," she added.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Launches Anti-Crime Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The South African
government today launched a nationwide program to teach women and
children self-defense skills to protect themselves from crime.
</P>
<P>
The "Crimebuster" program seeks to physically empower women
and children and train them in basic self-defense techniques in
the form of martial arts, and classes will be free of charge,
South African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
Financially backed by the private sector and controlled by the
South African Police Services in schools and martial arts centers
throughout the country, the program will be taken into schools,
karate clubs, women's organizations and even the work place.
</P>
<P>
Attending the launch at a hotel in Johannesburg today,
National Police Commissioner George Fivaz said: "We have nothing
to be proud of when it comes to our rate of crime against women
and children."
</P>
<P>
South Africa has by far the highest incidence of rape in the
world and the third highest reported crimes against children, he
said. Figures showed that every 25 seconds a woman is raped and
every six days a woman is murdered by her partner in the country.
</P>
<P>
"Women and children are now soft targets for criminals. We
cannot allow that to continue," Fivaz said.
</P>
<P>
The responsibility rested with all nationals rather than only
the police to tackle the problem, he said.

<HEADLINE> French Gov't Launches Inquiry into Fatal Avalanche </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The French government Saturday
launched an administrative inquiry into a fatal avalanche accident
which took place Friday in the French Alps and killed 11 people,
including nine teenagers, and injured nine others.
</P>
<P>
The Minister of Youths and Sports Marie-George Buffet said that
the investigation will be focused on the situation of the
organizing the racket rambling in the Alps, in which 40 people,
including 35 teenagers aged from 13 to 15, and their teachers and
supervisors took part.
</P>
<P>
The organizer of the rambling, the Union of Out-door Sports
Centers (UCPA), said earlier that the accident was "absolutely not
expected" and denied any mistake in organization.
</P>
<P>
Police said that when passing through the "wind plaque,"
which means unstable but seemingly solid snow-ground, the ramblers
themselves set in motion the avalanche, which came down on 32 of
them.
</P>
<P>
Police used helicopters in searching Friday evening and this
morning the people trapped under heavy snow in an operation which
was described as extremely delicate.
</P>
<P>
President Jacques Chirac, who is on a visit in India, has
expressed his condolences to the families of the victims, and
Prime Minister Lionel Jospin rushed to the scene of the accident
in Haute Alpes Friday evening.

<HEADLINE> Agency: Lack of Support Units Hampers Army Operations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Army could require
up to eight months to deliver the equipment and personnel needed
to wage two major regional wars unless force restructuring begins
soon, a new congressional study said.
</P>
<P>
The service does not have enough combat support units among its
active and reserve forces to support troops in the event of two
major regional wars, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) said.
It was published by the latest issue of the Defense News weekly.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that if a first war broke out in the Middle
East, it could take 140 days to get all Army forces to the
theater, rather than the 90 days projected in many Defense
Department plans.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it said, if a second war broke out in Asia within 45
days of the first, it could take up to 240 days to deploy all
needed forces, much longer than the 135 days planned.
</P>
<P>
To resolve the problem, the CBO suggested increasing reliance
on host-nation support and civilian contractors, creating
additional support forces in the active Army, combining the first
two alternatives, or relying on reserves more heavily to fight a
second war.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said that Army officials plan to reconfigure the
National Guardsmen so that 12 combat brigades, about 42,700
Guardsmen, become support units over the next 10 years.

<HEADLINE> U.S. May End Military Aid to Greece, Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The United States plans to
end decades of military aid to Greece and Turkey in its 1999 U.S.
budget request which is to be unveiled February 2, according to
the Defense News weekly to be published next week.
</P>
<P>
The plan could put U.S. defense contractors at a disadvantage
in those markets and may reinvigorate efforts to create a more
effective program to underwrite loans to prospective buyers of
U.S. weapons, the weekly said.
</P>
<P>
With serious financial problems eroding Turkey's credit rating,
the U.S. is considering converting to grants the 150 million U.S.
dollars in loans for Turkey and 105 million U.S. dollars for
Greece in 1998 budget.
</P>
<P>
The loans to Turkey would be converted into an approximately 20
million U.S. dollars grant, the cost to the U.S. Treasury of
guaranteeing that loan.
</P>
<P>
Greece would receive a grant equal to 70 percent of the grant
given to Turkey in keeping with the past U.S. aid practice of
promoting a balance between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
U.S. aid to the two has been linked for decades to avoiding a
shift in the military balance of power in the Aegean Sea.
</P>
<P>
Greek and Turkish officials were informed of the plan to
eliminate military assistance on January 22, the magazine quoted
officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
The move "will make it more difficult to market equipment in
these countries," said Joel Johnson, vice president for
international affairs of the Aerospace Industries Association.
</P>
<P>
The magazine quoted a Greek official as saying that he expected
the cutoff in aid would have only a marginal effect on Greek
interest in buying U.S. arms.
</P>
<P>
The aid cutoff is a disappointment for Turkey, according the
weekly.
</P>
<P>
"This would be a symbolic but sad move. We still have a
considerable role in NATO due to the instability around us," the
Turkish official said.
</P>
<P>
However, the official said that Turkey's ability to pay for its
defense needs will not be significantly changed.
</P>
<P>
"Even if the United States scraps these loans for Turkey, we
will not be affected. We are already spending billions of dollars
from our own assets and are able to pay for our defense," said the
official.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Workshop Contributes to African Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ARUSHA, Tanzania, January 24 (Xinhua) -- An international
workshop on African conflicts ending here Friday was believed to
be able to contribute to peace-making efforts on the continent.
</P>
<P>
"I am sure the outcome of this workshop will be an important
output to the work of those grappling with the search for
peaceful solutions to Africa's conflicts, and will help to give
peace a real chance," said Tanzanian Prime Minister Fredrich
Sumaye at the closing ceremony of the workshop here.
</P>
<P>
Some 200 peace-makers, diplomats and representatives of
international, regional and non-governmental organizations
gathered in the northern Tanzanian summer resort of Arusha from
Wednesday to Friday to exchange views on African conflict
resolution.
</P>
<P>
Former conflict mediators presented their experiences in their
mediation efforts and reflected on lessons drawn from their work.
</P>
<P>
Delegates believe that peace could not be achieved if the
parties in conflict did not want peace.
</P>
<P>
"In the final analysis, a negotiated settlement of a conflict
is only possible if the parties to the conflict favor a peaceful
solution," said Felix Mosha, a former U.N. representative in
Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Delegates repeatedly pointed out that peace agreements were
often not implemented because of the lack of will for peace among
conflicting parties.
</P>
<P>
Julius Nyerere, chairman of the workshop and facilitator of
the Burundi peace process, told reporters Friday that the problem
with Burundi is that some people in the country are still not fed
up with guns. He said he was waiting for a "click" -- a signal of
the will for peace -- from Burundi.
</P>
<P>
Participants of the workshop also emphasized the importance of
the establishment of a regional mechanism for conflict
prevention, management and resolution.
</P>
<P>
Delegates praised the success of the involvement of the
Economic Community of West African States and implored the delay
of action of African countries to prevent the 1994 Rwandan
genocide.
</P>
<P>
Both Sumaye and Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni highlighted
the importance of a consistent and concerted regional stance for
regional problems.
</P>
<P>
Delegates agreed that Africans themselves should start to
handle conflicts themselves.
</P>
<P>
In the closing speech, Sumaye said on behalf of Tanzanian
President Benjamin Mkapa: "These conflicts (in Africa) are a
product of African action or inaction. Hence their resolution
will be realized to a large extent by focusing on the domestic or
regional scene, but with continued support from outside."
</P>
<P>
"After 40 years of independence, we can only have ourselves to
blame if we continue to be influenced by the legacy of
colonialism."
</P>
<P>
Delegates believed that the best way was to prevent conflicts
from taking place, rather than grappling with conflicts and their
aftermath.
</P>
<P>
They urged more efforts on education and the alleviation of
poverty and encouraged the involvement of the civil society and
women in the process of conflict prevention and resolution.
</P>
<P>
The three-day workshop, sponsored by the United Nations
Development Program, was jointly organized by the Tanzanian
Foreign Ministry and the Mwalimu Nyerere Foundation.

<HEADLINE> Drug Cases Decline in Zanzibar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Zanzibar has seen a decline
of drug cases after the police tightened security at airports and
harbours.
</P>
<P>
A total of 113 drug related cases were reported in 1997, much less
than that of the previous year, said a senior police
official, Shaffi Mussa Haji.
</P>
<P>
The decline of drug cases reflects that the surveillance at the
harbours and airports of the isles has been successful, Haji was
quoted by today's newspaper The Guardian as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said police have identified major drugs smuggled into
Zanzibar, as heroine, cocaine, morphine, mandrax and
marijuana.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the police seized three kilograms of marijuana, 13 grams
of heroine, one gram of cocaine, 0.3 grams of morphine and 0.4 grams
of mandrax.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the reasons for the success, Haji said the police have
been equipped with latest technology of trailing drug trafficking and
members of the Anti-drug Unit has expanded from 13 to 40.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Central Bank Checks Interest Rate Abuse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of Nigeria is
moving to discourage the "unacceptable" widespread of bank
deposit and lending rate which has climbed up to a new high of 14
percent.
</P>
<P>
The rate almost doubles the maximum level of 7.5 percent
allowed for under the central bank's monetary policy guideline,
thus the bank has vowed to closely monitor and influence the
determination of deposit rates in the financial system in view of
"the perceived abuses in the system".
</P>
<P>
According to the official daily New Nigerian today, the
central bank has decided to sanction banks that took undue
advantage of the deregulation of the financial sector to abuse
the tariff regime.
</P>
<P>
It said that the average lending rate of interest last year
hovered between 18 and 20 percent, while that of savings ranged
from four to 12.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Worried by the situation, the Federal Ministry of Finance
directed the central bank to halt the trend which had seen some
big banks paying their savings customers less than four percent
while they lend to the small-scale industries at over 24 percent,
a spread of over 16 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
"This is not equitable and explains the high rate of default
by such borrowers," a situation unfavorable to an economy in dire
need of capital for investment, the paper quoted a chartered
accountant as saying.
</P>
<P>
Small savers were usually the victims of inequitable interest
rate on deposit, especially in the rural areas where over 70
percent of Nigerians live, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government has recently taken tough measures in
its bid to sanitize the banking sector of the country.
</P>
<P>
Following the closure of 282 ailing community banks across the
country in one operation last November, the central bank shut
down 26 local distressed commercial and merchant banks earlier
this week.
</P>
<P>
Central bank Governor Paul Ogwuma said in the capital Abuja
Monday that the apex bank will continue to make its best
endeavors to tighten financial discipline.

<HEADLINE> Oman's Oil Revenues Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Oman's oil revenues jumped by
12 percent during the first 11 months of 1997 over that of the
same period in 1996, to top 4 billion U.S. dollars, the Omani news
agency reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
A report by Oman's Ministry of Oil and Gas attributed the growth
to a 3.2 percent increase in oil exports, according to the news
agency.
</P>
<P>
A total of 278.4 million barrels of oil were exported during
the first 11 months of last year, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Oman produced a total of 330 million barrels of oil in 1997, 6
million and 17 million barrels more than that of 1996 and 1995,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
As a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting

<HEADLINE> African Leaders Stress Regional Integration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Twelve African leaders
Saturday called for regional integration in their forum on
development strategies.
</P>
<P>
The leaders from the Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya,
Mozambique, Rwanda, Senegal, Tanzania, Zimbabwe, Ethiopia,
Botswana, South Africa, Zambia and their Ugandan host gathered
here for a two-day meeting as from Friday.
</P>
<P>
The integration is the first step in their way to cooperation
and an economic community, said the joint statement issued by the
African leaders.
</P>
<P>
The leaders representing 47 percent of population in
sub-Saharan Africa underlined the need of cooperation among equal
partners in the region in face of imbalanced development.
</P>
<P>
The existing trade barriers among African countries must be
reduced gradually for a more beneficial regional cooperation, the
leaders pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Africa is a relatively underdeveloped continent, which is
witnessed by inadequate infrastructure, undeveloped human
resources and subsistence farming in fragmented land, they noted.
</P>
<P>
There is a need to reverse the negative features of the
African economies as a first step toward the sustainable
development of the continent, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The priorities for the development of the areas are education
and professional training, rural transformation, private sector
development, the development of infrastructure, conflict
prevention and resolution and public sector reform and good
governance, the leaders said.
</P>
<P>
The leaders called for good governance and peaceful
co-existence among African countries and called upon the World
Bank and other development partners to support African member
states which are suffering from the consequences of conflicts to
reconstruct their economies.
</P>
<P>
The leaders also called on the World Bank to provide financial
supports of long terms over five years for the development of the
region.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank, in its turn, is the largest source of
multilateral development finance in the continent, providing a
yearly investment of two billion Dollars in various programs.
</P>
<P>
James Wolfensohn, the president of the World Bank,
participated in the meeting which ended here Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The countries sending their president, deputy president,
premier or a minister to the meeting account for 50 percent of
goods exported by the whole continent and for 60 percent of its
gross domestic product.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Govt Calls for Efforts Against Crime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government here
Saturday called for collective action against the rising tides of
crime which has assumed higher proportions and become more
sophisticated for conventional means of control.
</P>
<P>
Officially closing the first four-day crime conference held in
the capital, Home Affairs Deputy Minister Peter Muliga said that
economic development in many countries has given rise to a higher
crime rate.
</P>
<P>
"These development-related crimes have become regional and
international in scope, thus necessitating equally wider and
collective integrated and international actions," said the
official.
</P>
<P>
Muliga pointed out that the traditional control measures have
become insufficient to cope with new forms of crimes such as
robberies, car thefts, drug abuse and drug trafficking, the
Zambia News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
He added that many preventive measures taken by police in
order to keep law and order have often placed restrictions on the
rights and freedoms of the people, thereby creating
misunderstanding between law enforcement agencies and the public.
</P>
<P>
There is need for both the law enforcement officers and the
public to understand and appreciate each other's roles and
expectations so as to avoid unnecessary confrontation and
violation of human rights, Muliga stressed.
</P>
<P>
He urged participants from the Zambia Police, Anti-corruption
Commission, Private Security Services, business community and
other organizations to turn the resolutions of the conference
into practical policy measures.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Warns Against Opening of Air Base in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Turkey said Saturday that
turning of a military air base near the western coastal town of
Paphos in Cyprus into an operational form was a reflection of a
new chain of the aggressive policy of the Greek Cypriot side.
</P>
<P>
A statement by the Turkish Foreign Ministry said that the
Cypriot government, which intensified arms buildup in the southern
part of the Cyprus island, concluded the construction of the
Paphos military air base.
</P>
<P>
"We are sure that the international community will evaluate this
development as required," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is closely following all the activities of Greece and
Greek Cypriot side threatening peace and stability on the island
and in Eastern Mediterranean, said the statement, adding that "we
are bringing this dangerous development to the attention of the
secretary-general of the United Nations and the head of the U.N.
Security Council."
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that as a guarantor country, Turkey will
continue to take measures against every kind of initiatives that
may endanger security of northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Those who take these grave steps will assume responsibility to
this end, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The Paphos air base was constructed under a joint defense pact
signed in November 1993 between the Cypriot and Greek
governments. Under the pact, Greece will provide military
assistance if Cyprus is attacked.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government also decided last year to buy
Russian-made anti-aircraft S-300 missiles, which are expected to
be deployed later this year.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriot side has reportedly threatened to open an
air base in northern Cyprus in response to the Paphos air base.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated south
and Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkey landed
its troops and took over the northern third of the island in the
wake of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has maintained 35,000 troops to protect the minority
Turkish Cypriots in northern Cyprus.

<HEADLINE> W. Bank President Starts Visit to Ethiopia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, January 24 (Xinhua) -- World Bank President James
Wolfensohn arrived here on Saturday evening for a four-day
working visit to seal the pacts for giving 500 million U.S.
Dollars of aid to Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
The visit followed a two-day meeting of southern and eastern
African leaders in Kampala, where Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni urged participants to chart future relations between the
World Bank and the sub-region.
</P>
<P>
Upon arrival at the airport here, the World Bank president was
welcomed by Girma Biru, Ethiopian minister for economic
development and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Wolfensohn told newsmen on his arrival that "the World Bank
gives the maximum support to Ethiopia", saying that
infrastructural development is expected to dominate the
discussion he will hold with Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles
Zenawi.
</P>
<P>
Wolfensohn is the first World Bank president to visit Ethiopia
since 1970. During his stay here, he is expected to hold talks
with Prime Minister Meles and executives of the Organization of
African Unity (OAU). He will give a speech entitled "Africa:
toward the 21st century" here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the representative of the World Bank here has
announced that his Bank has approved in the past two months two
projects in Ethiopia amounting to 500 million U.S. Dollars,
making the country the largest beneficiary in sub-Saharan Africa.
The agreements will be signed during the visit of the World Bank
chief here, the representative said.

<HEADLINE> Calm Returns to Kenya's Rift Valley After Clashes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Calm has returned to the Rift
Valley Province of Kenya after two-week ethnic clashes and cattle
rustling killed as many as 29 people there, police spokesman
Peter Kimanthi said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"Calm has returned to Laikipia but the security forces have
discovered seven more bodies in the bush, so the total number (of
the killed) has risen from 22 to 29," he said. Laikipia District
is north of the Mount Kenya.
</P>
<P>
"The police have been able to contain it... the security
presence there is now very large," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that residents who fled Laikipia when clashes started
on January 11 were reportedly returning home after communal and
local government leaders reassumed that it was safe to return.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he blamed cattle-rustling for the series of attacks
in the area, dominated by Kikuyus, Samburus and some Pokots.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the clashes started when unidentified people
attacked a homestead of Pokots on January 11, killing 40 goats
and slashing cattle, leading to a revenge attack by Pokots in
which two were killed.
</P>
<P>
"From then on it became attack and counter-attack. That is
what raised the number (of the killed)," he said.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, several gunmen raided a shopping center at Laikipia
District, killed two people including a primary school teacher
and wounded eight, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Seven police posts now has been set up and a new division
created in the district.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus to Take Measures to Boost Stock Exchange </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus will take a number of
measures to boost the Cyprus Stock Exchange (CSE) as a regional
financial center, President Glafcos Clerides said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Three bills in this regard will be tabled in the House of
Representatives and expected to come into force in March, he told
a Cyprus-Greece Stock Exchange Symposium here.
</P>
<P>
Clerides said that through the first bill, offshore companies
in Cyprus will be able to invest in CSE listed companies' stocks,
without lossing their special tax status while their income from
these investments will not be taxed.
</P>
<P>
The second provides that the tax rate of companies, which will
seek listing within the coming five years, will be cut by 50
percent from the day their titles are introduced.
</P>
<P>
The third bill ensures that the cost of acquisition of
new-listed shares will be partly exempt from tax for four years
instead of two years.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the regulations for offshore companies in
Cyprus will offer Greek businessmen the opportunity to become more
active in eastern Europe, the former Soviet Union Republics and
the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The one-day symposium, attended by more than 200 officials,
stock brokers and investors from Cyprus and Greece, aims to assess
prospects of wooing Greek private and institutional players to the
CSE.
</P>
<P>
The CSE was launched in March 1996 after years of operating in
an unofficial capacity under the auspices of the Cyprus Chamber of
Commerce and Industry. It trades in 98 securities of 46 listed
companies and has a market capitalization of about 1.3 billion
Cyprus pounds (around 2.6 billion U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Workshop Contributes to African Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ARUSHA, Tanzania, January 24 (Xinhua) -- An international
workshop on African conflicts ending here Friday was believed to
be able to contribute to peace-making efforts on the continent.
</P>
<P>
"I am sure the outcome of this workshop will be an important
output to the work of those grappling with the search for
peaceful solutions to Africa's conflicts, and will help to give
peace a real chance," said Tanzanian Prime Minister Fredrich
Sumaye at the closing ceremony of the workshop here.
</P>
<P>
Some 200 peace-makers, diplomats and representatives of
international, regional and non-governmental organizations
gathered in the northern Tanzanian summer resort of Arusha from
Wednesday to Friday to exchange views on African conflict
resolution.
</P>
<P>
Former conflict mediators presented their experiences in their
mediation efforts and reflected on lessons drawn from their work.
</P>
<P>
Delegates believe that peace could not be achieved if the
parties in conflict did not want peace.
</P>
<P>
"In the final analysis, a negotiated settlement of a conflict
is only possible if the parties to the conflict favor a peaceful
solution," said Felix Mosha, a former U.N. representative in
Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Delegates repeatedly pointed out that peace agreements were
often not implemented because of the lack of will for peace among
conflicting parties.
</P>
<P>
Julius Nyerere, chairman of the workshop and facilitator of
the Burundi peace process, told reporters Friday that the problem
with Burundi is that some people in the country are still not fed
up with guns. He said he was waiting for a "click" -- a signal of
the will for peace -- from Burundi.
</P>
<P>
Participants of the workshop also emphasized the importance of
the establishment of a regional mechanism for conflict
prevention, management and resolution.
</P>
<P>
Delegates praised the success of the involvement of the
Economic Community of West African States and deplored the delay
of action of African countries to prevent the 1994 Rwandan
genocide.
</P>
<P>
Both Sumaye and Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni highlighted
the importance of a consistent and concerted regional stance for
regional problems.
</P>
<P>
Delegates agreed that Africans themselves should start to
handle conflicts themselves.
</P>
<P>
In the closing speech, Sumaye said on behalf of Tanzanian
President Benjamin Mkapa: "These conflicts (in Africa) are a
product of African action or inaction. Hence their resolution
will be realized to a large extent by focusing on the domestic or
regional scene, but with continued support from outside."
</P>
<P>
"After 40 years of independence, we can only have ourselves to
blame if we continue to be influenced by the legacy of
colonialism."
</P>
<P>
Delegates believed that the best way was to prevent conflicts
from taking place, rather than to grapple with conflicts and
their aftermath.
</P>
<P>
They urged more efforts on education and the alleviation of
poverty and encouraged the involvement of the civil society and
women in the process of conflict prevention and resolution.
</P>
<P>
The three-day workshop, sponsored by the United Nations
Development Program, was jointly organized by the Tanzanian
Foreign Ministry and the Mwalimu Nyerere Foundation.

<HEADLINE> Clinton's Advisers Discussing Options on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 24 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton's
foreign policy advisers met on Saturday at the White House,
discussing options to address the current standoff with Iraq
over weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
"The president's senior advisers are going to be examinging
our options and considering what strategy we should pursue with
our allies and other members of the Security Council," White
House spokesman Eric Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
He said Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, CIA Director
George Tenet, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Bill
Richardson and other top officials met with National Security
Adviser Sandy Berger at the White House.
</P>
<P>
"Diplomacy is our preferred course but we have not ruled out
any option," he said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting of the top foreign policy advisers took place in
the wake of a report to the U.N. Security Council on Friday by
the chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler, who said Iraq
seemed determined to withhold any new information about its
weapons programs and to prevent U.N. inspectors from obtaining
it themselves if that meant entering certain sites.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post reported on Saturday that a consensus
among senior Clinton advisers emerged during hours of intensive
White House meetings in recent days that military action will be
necessary to force Iraq to comply with U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
"President Clinton and his senior national security advisers
have concluded that a military strike against Iraq ia likely
within a few weeks unless Iraqi President Saddam Hussein stops
interfering with the work of U.N. weapons inspectors," The
Washington Post quoted highly placed U.S. officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
Many of senior foreign policy advisers' discussions are
focusing on what action would follow a campaign of heavy air
bombardment led by the United States with assistance from
Britain.
</P>
<P>
Under one scenario being considered by the Clinton
administration, a bombing campaign lasting several days would be
followed by an expansion of the "no-fly" zones over Iraq to
cover the entire country, The newspapers said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said on Friday that they had not abandoned the
possibility of a peaceful solution to the impasse. But they said
Clinton saw little hope for a breakthrough unless he puts U.S.
naval and air forces on a countdown to military intervention,
and notifies allied governments that a strike is imminent.

<HEADLINE> Qatar Denies Egyptian Allegation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, January 24 (xinhua) -- Qatar has denied an
allegation that Egyptians working in it's government departments
were being sacked and sent home under a deliberate policy, the
UAE's WAM news agency reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Qatar's Foreign Ministry Spokesman Fawaz al Attiyah said in a
statement carried by WAM that the dismissal of Egyptians was not
part of a conscious policy.
</P>
<P>
"Every government department and agency has the right to
choose is staff and renew or not to renew its work permits. But I
can tell you that Egyptians had the lion's share in employment
contracts given by the government civil service departments in
1997," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Qatari statement came after Egyptian ambassador in Qatar
Mohammed Minessey claimed that over 100 Egyptians working at
Qatar's government departments had been fired in a move related to
tension between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said "some 134 Egyptians have already been
sacked and about 250 are to be dismissed." Relations between
Qatar and Egypt became tense after a war of words broke out in
November last year.
</P>
<P>
The row was triggered by a regional economic summit held in
Doha in mid-November.
</P>
<P>
Egypt boycotted the Middle East and North Africa Economic
Conference due to Israel's attendance. Cairo said the conference
was "useless" and "even the Qatari people were unhappy to convene
such a meeting." Doha was angered and accused Egypt of meddling in
the Qatari internal affairs.

<HEADLINE> Northern Cyprus Criticizes Opening of Military </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The self-claimed Turkish Cypriot
republic said the opening of the military air base by the Greek
Cypriot side Saturday will spoil peace and stability in the island
and Eastern Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's semi-official Anatolia news agency quoted Taner Etkin,
or the "foreign and defense minister" of northern Cyprus as saying
in Nicosia that the opening of the base near the western coastal
town of Paphos will create "grave results" in the region.
</P>
<P>
Etkin said "We have drawn the attention of all the related
parties to this development which could make a threat to our
security and to peace and security in the region."
</P>
<P>
The Paphos air base was constructed under a joint defense pact
signed in November 1993 between Cypriot and Greek governments and
under the pact, the base will be used by Greek air force planes.
</P>
<P>
The Greek and Turkish communities have lived separately since
Turkey landed its troops on the island in 1974 in response to a
Greek Cypriot coup in Nicosia backed by Greece. A "Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus" was proclaimed in 1983, but only
recognized by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriot side has reportedly threatened to open an
air base in the northern Cyprus in response to the Paphos base.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government also decided last year to buy
Russian-made anti-aircraft S-300 missiles, due to arrive in
August, principally to arm the Paphos air base.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has maintained some 35,000 troops to protect the
minority Turkish Cypriots in northern Cyprus.

</P>
<P>
Arafat, on his way to Morocco and Tunisia, made the stopover

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's ANC Dismisses "Afrikaner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 25 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's ruling
African National Congress (ANC) Sunday dismissed claims by former
state president P. W. Botha that Afrikaners were organizing to
protect their rights, saying Afrikaners would not accept such
allegations.
</P>
<P>
Responding to comments made by Botha Friday after his court
hearing, ANC spokesman Ronnie Mamoepa said Sunday that the
Afrikaans community would reject attempts to use their name for
"nefarious political objectives", South African Press Association
reported.
</P>
<P>
Botha, after having appeared in the George Regional Court in
Western Cape Province Friday for refusing to testify before the
Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), said that the
government was "waking the tiger in the Afrikaner" and the tiger
would fight back if oppressed.
</P>
<P>
Mamoepa said the ANC remained convinced that most Afrikaners
saw their future as inextricably bound up with the rest of South
Africa's people.
</P>
<P>
"Never before has Afrikaner language, culture, and religion
been so protected than they are now under a democracy," Mamoepa
said.
</P>
<P>
The challenge, however, lay with Afrikaner leaders across the
political spectrum to state whether they were part of the
organization Botha was referring to, he said.
</P>
<P>
Afrikaners constitute more than half of the country's white
population, the privileged class during decades of Apartheid rule
until its end in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Mamoepa said Botha's comments vindicated the TRC's attempts to
subpoena him, who was prime minister and then state president
between 1978 and 1989, to account for the activities of the
former State Security Council.
</P>
<P>
"It is ironic that a leader of a party which nurtured and
developed apartheid and separate development could be so
presumptuous to lecture a new democratic government on the
dangers of racism," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We express our confidence in the ability of the TRC to
contribute to the process of national reconciliation, peace and
nation building," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The sluggish Ukrainian economy
showed signs of slight improvement in 1997 though it still did not
reverse its downward trend in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Ukrainian Statistical Bureau said last year Ukrain's gross
domestic product, the total industrial and agricultural output
value decreased by 3.2 percent, 1.8 percent and 2 percent
respectively from 1996.
</P>
<P>
But these figures were smaller compared with the 10 percent,
5.1 percent and 9 percent of decrease in 1996 over 1995.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the country's inflation rate was 10.1 percent in
1997, down from the 39.7 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
For the first 11 months of 1997, the bureau said, the country's
budget deficit stood at 5.1 billion hryvna, or 2.5 billion
U.S. dollars, accounting for 6.4 percent of the gross domestic
product. The government is trying to bring the figure to 2.5
percent this year.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Ukrainian central bank took measures to stablize the
hryvna, putting it at 1.7 to 1.9 against the U.S. dollar. It is
expected to be kept between 1.8 to 2.25 against the dollar this
year.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 25 (Xinhua) -- King Hussein of Jordan arrived
here Sunday afternoon on a one-day visit for talks with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
The two Arab leaders' talks focus on the recent developments
of the peace process in addition to relations between Jordan and
Egypt.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein is accompanied on his visit by a top level
delegation of Jordanian officials.
</P>
<P>
Jordan and Egypt are the only two Arab countries that have
signed peace treaties with Israel, which has been locked in a
10-month peace-making deadlock with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The visit of the Jordanian monarch came a day before
Palestinian National Authority President Yasser Arafat comes to
Cairo on his way home from Washington.
</P>
<P>
Arafat is expected to discuss with Mubarak on Monday what the
next step should be taken to save the faltering Mideast peace
process. But it is yet unknown whether there will be a three-way
meeting of the three Arab leaders in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace talks have deadlocked since March
1996 after Israel started to build a new settlement in Arab East
Jerusalem and a spate of Palestinian suicide bombings followed in
Israel.
</P>
<P>
The recent talks U.S. President Bill Clinton held in Washington
with Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have
failed to break the ice.

<HEADLINE> Iran Criticizes Algeria for Rejecting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi Sunday criticized the Algerian government for rejecting
the efforts of Iran and other countries to help end the ongoing
massacres of innocent people in Algeria.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the official news agency IRNA, Kharrazi expressed
"dismay at the way the Algerian officials have reacted to
attempts" by the European Union (EU) and Iran, as the chairman of
the Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC), to stop the
"suspicious" carnage of people in Algeria
</P>
<P>
"The conscience of people in world, especially in the world
of Islam, have been hurt by such savage massacres of people
by unidentified elements and all are trying to stop
the carnage," he said.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, Kharrazi said, the Algerian government has
interpreted such humanitarian efforts as "meddling in the
internal affairs of Algeria", accusing others of supporting the
yet unknown perpetrators of these criminal acts.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of the massacre of hundreds of Algerian
people in the past weeks, the Iranian government expressed
great concern over the issue and contacted various countries and
international organizations, calling for international efforts to
put an end to the Algerian tragedy.
</P>
<P>
As the OIC chairman, Tehran voiced its readiness and
willingness to offer every possible assistance to curb bloodshed
in Algeria. However, the Algerian government repeatedly said that
no foreign meddling should be allowed over the killings since the
issue is an internal affair of the country.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi stressed that the reaction of the Algerian officials
to the issue only adds to the doubt and pessimism of world given
the fact that the Algerian government forces are not doing
anything to stop the bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
He once again called on the international community not to
be indifferent to the carnage of innocent people in Algeria.

<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Sudan's inflation rate rose to
32 percent in January compared with 28 percent and 19 percent in
the previous two months, Sudanese Minister of State at the Finance
Ministry Saber Mohammed Al-Hassan announced Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Al-Hassan attributed the high inflation rate registered this
month to the failure of the financial agencies to observe the
curbs laid by the Finance Ministry on dealing in foreign currency,
including failure to borrow from the banking system.
</P>
<P>
He said that the financial policies adopted by the Sudanese
government over the past two years, including rationalizing public
spending, promoting public revenues, working out sound taxation
policies, caused the inflation rate to decline and the exchange
rate to stabilize.
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, the inflation rate in Sudan exceeded 145
percent, but then plummeted to 21 percent in 1997.

BEIJING, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The Yunnan Provincial Committee

<HEADLINE> PNA Challenges Israel to International Arbitration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERICHO, PALESTINE, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Further frustrated
by continued deadlock in the peace process, the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) Sunday demanded international arbitration
over Israel's refusal to implement signed agreements.
</P>
<P>
The call for international arbitration was issued by senior
PNA negotiator Saeb Erekat at a news conference held here on the
results of the just-concluded Washington talks between
U.S. President Bill Clinton and PNA President Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Erekat, upset by the Clinton's failure to pressure Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to break the deadlock, said the
PNA is challenging Israel to accept international arbitration over
implementing the signed peace agreements.
</P>
<P>
"We are willing to accept international arbitration and to
accept the international arbitration immediately. We urged
Netanyahu, if he wants seriousness on the concept of reciprocity
for implementation, to accept the Oslo accords and to accept
international arbitration on elements provided for in the Oslo
accords," he said.
</P>
<P>
Erekat said Arafat reiterated to Clinton his position that the
Oslo agreements provided for international arbitration.
</P>
<P>
He said Arafat presented Clinton two letters, one on the PNA
ideas on how to revive the peace process, including the PNA
promises to fight terrorism and Israeli commitment to redeploying
troops in the West Bank in three phases; the other on the
Palestinian Covenant, reiterating the provisions calling for
Israel's destruction have been nullified by the Palestinian
National Council in 1996.
</P>
<P>
He said both Arafat and Clinton reiterated that Israel should
carry out the three-phase redeployments in the West Bank
according to the letter sent by former U.S. Secretary of State
Warren Christopher following the signing of the Hebron accord in
January last year.
</P>
<P>
Arafat reaffirmed that there would be no credible peace
process if Israel continues expanding settlements, confiscating
land and demolishing Palestinian houses.
</P>
<P>
Erekat strongly denounced Netanyahu for attempting to find any
pretexts and excuses to avoid implementing the signed agreements.
</P>
<P>
He said the PNA has been fed up with the Netanyahu
administration:" We told Mr. Netanyahu openly now: you cannot be
the judge as a whole, we have the international arbitration
machanism provided for by the Oslo accords...We want Mr. Netanyahu
to accept the principle and put this case at the table for
international arbitration."
</P>
<P>
Erekat said U.S. officials told the Palestinian delegation in
Washington that the ongoing sex scandal enveloping Clinton would
not affect the U.S. efforts to revive the peace process. But he
warned that following the failure of the Washington talks to
revive the peace process, the PNA is seriously considering
changing its position toward Israel.
</P>
<P>
"We look seriously now (at) the reassessment of the situation
within our own courtyard of Palestinians, within Arab courtyard
and international courtyard," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Arafat is now having a tour of the Arab world and
will travel to Britain Monday to prepare for the reassessment.
Britain is currently holding the rotating presidency of the
European Union.

<P>
TUNIS, January 25 (Xinhua) -- President of the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) Yasser Arafat left Rabat Sunday for
Algeria, winding up his brief visit to Morocco during which he met
with King Hassan II.
</P>
<P>
Arafat briefed the Moroccan monarch on the outcome of his
recent talks with U.S. President Bill Clinton in Washington on
ways of reviving Palestinian-Israeli peace negotiations, according
to the official Moroccan News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Following his meeting with King Hassan II Saturday evening,
Arafat confirmed that his Washington talks with Clinton failed.
When he arrived in Rabat Saturday, Arafat said that "the talks in
Washington brought no solution to the deadlocked peace process
because of Mr.(Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu's
position."
</P>
<P>
He said that "we pin great hopes on the European Union for
reviving the Middle East peace process."
</P>
<P>
Arafat also accused Netanyahu of failing to keep his promises
to push forward the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The PNA president called on Israel to halt its settlement
policy and to lift its blockade laid on Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
Arafat arrived in Rabat Saturday evening from the Mauritanian
capital of Nouakchott.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Refugees Longing for Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, January 25 (Xinhua) -- "We want to go home, and live a
peaceful life." This is the common wish of almost one million
war refugees in Angola who are still struggling for existence in
refugee camps even three years after the warring sides signed the
Lusaka peace accord.
</P>
<P>
In Boa Esperanca camp, 50 km north of the capital Luanda, over
36,000 refugees still dwell in lines of low and dark thatched
shacks by the road side.
</P>
<P>
They came from Bengo province to the north of Luanda, when
fightings broke out again in 1993 between the Angolan government
army and forces of the National Union for the Total Independence
of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
Braving the gunfires and bullets, villagers from the central
part of the province tried to escape in the direction of Luanda.
When 45,000 of them finally made it to the present camp site,
they could hardly move any further due to hunger, fatigue and
illnesses.
</P>
<P>
The camp, which used to be a wasted land with wild weeds
growing high on the ground, came into being with tents provided
by United Nations organizations. At the very beginning, 45
people shared a tent. Afterwards, the refugees started to build
thatched shanties with trees and thatch.
</P>
<P>
Life around the camp was very hard with no water to irrigate
the land for crops. A German non-governmental organization
provided each refugee with 30 kg of maize, 8 kg of beans and 300
mil of plant oil. It is reported that the last food supply was in
last December and now many families are out of food.
</P>
<P>
Lack of drinking water and malnutrition had made it worse for
the refugees. The recent high temperature had given rise to the
spreading of malaria and diarrhoea in the camp.
</P>
<P>
Paulo Mateus who is in charge of the camp, said every day
eight to ten people die in the camp, therefore the camp
population has dwindled to the present 36,000.
</P>
<P>
"Returning to home is their common desire," he noted. However,
he said, since UNITA forces are still armed, situation in their
home town is still unstable. The refugees dare not go home for
fear of the 1993 war. They hope that peace will finally return
to the country so that they could live and work safely.
</P>
<P>
The Boa Esperanca camp is only one of the dozens of camps in
the country. During the 20-year-long civil war, nearly three
million Angolans became refugees, with 700,000 wandering to other
countries, living a miserable life.

incapable of making political gain.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Iran to Lose 3-4 Billion Dollars in Oil Revenue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Iran is expected to lose 3-4
billion U.S. dollars in oil revenue in the fiscal year starting
from March 21 due to the drop of oil price, local English daily
Iran News reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Iran has expected that the price of oil will stand at 16
dollars per barrel.
</P>
<P>
But Hossein Baher, secretary general of Iran's Management
Academy told the daily that the price of Iran's oil will be at
about 12 to 13 dollars a barrel in 1998.
</P>
<P>
He said a fall of one dollar per barrel of oil will lead to one
billion dollars loss of Iran's oil revenue.
</P>
<P>
The drop of oil price is mainly caused by the economic crises
in southeastern Asia, the resumption of Iraqi oil export and an
increase of the oil production quota by the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) last November.
</P>
<P>
The OPEC raised Iran's production ceiling to 3.94 million
barrels per day (bpd) from 3.6 million bpd as of January 1.
</P>
<P>
Iran exports an average of 2.5 million barrels of oil a day at
present.

<HEADLINE> India's Inflation Rate Up to 5.73 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 25 (Xinhua) -- India's annual rate of
inflation was up further to 5.73 percent for the latest week due
to unrelented increase in prices of primary food articles, Press
Trust of India (PTI) said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Inflation, based on the wholesale price index (WPI), for the
week ending January 10, shot up by 0.32 percentage points to 5.73
percent (provisional), the highest in six months.
</P>
<P>
In the last four weeks alone, the index for primary food
articles, with a weight of 17.39 percent in WPI, went up by 5.74
percent.
</P>
<P>
The slackening of demand was cited by economists as the main
reason for the low levels witnessed in the second half of 1997.
The increase in inflation is mainly on account of picking up of
demand as the economy is coming out of the slowdown.

<P>
FUZHOU, January 25 (Xinhua) -- East China's Fujian province has
nearly 5,000 Taiwan-funded firms backed by 9.5 billion US dollars
worth of Taiwanese contracts.
</P>
<P>
Eighty percent of these companies are showing a profit,
according to recent statistics, and Taiwan has become the
province's second largest investor, after Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Fujian is directly across the Taiwan Straits from Taiwan and
has seen the investment grow rapidly in the past several
years. The average amount of investment for each project was 5.9
million US dollars in 1997, up from less than a million in 1988.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing gets 80 percent of the funds, but labor-intensive
projects are giving way to technological ones like machine
building and electronics.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture has also become a major place for cooperation,
attracting one billion US dollars worth of Taiwanese funds for
1,000 companies.
</P>
<P>
The province has set up four special zones for Taiwanese
investment, which now have 480 Taiwan-funded projects.

the 50th anniversary of independence day celebration, which falls
on February 4, and to demoralize and divide the Sri Lankans, the
minister said.
</P>
<P>
He added that under on circumstances will the planned
celebration activities be changed.
</P>
<P>
He called on the people to get together and immediately
reconstruct the damaged temple.

sustained damage due to the impact. However, the holiest tooth
relic, believed to be the tooth of the Buddha, remain intact
inside the inner chamber.
</P>
<P>
The attack took place at 6:10 (local time). So far it has
claimed 12 lives.
</P>
<P>
This was the first major LTTE attack against the Golden Jubilee

Security Ministry, a recent conference in Shanghai was told.
</P>
<P>
Some 180 of the city's public security bureaus have established
crime information centers containing 115,000 bits of information
on escapees and more than 300,000 on stolen motor vehicles. Using
this information, police have managed to arrest 2,500 escapees and
recover some 20,000 stolen motor vehicles, the conference was told.
</P>

regulation on sale of security products for the information
centers.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Pu Yunxia, a female laborer
who has returned to her village in northwest China's Ningxia Hui
Autonomous Region from Fujian Province in the east, has brought
back 3,000 yuan and two big parcels for Spring Festival.
</P>
<P>
Her six-member family get by on two ha of barren farmland and
make no more than 3,000 yuan annually. But now that Pu is working
in an electronics plant in Fujian, she earns more than three times
what the rest of the family does, and is only one of the many
people working elsewhere to support their families.
</P>
<P>
"One worker can feed the whole family. So we don't need to
worry about our daily life any longer," she explains.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Ministry says that China has 50 or 60 million rural
laborers looking for jobs elsewhere in China each year.
</P>
<P>
As the Spring Festival gets near, some 37 million transient
workers in 23 major cities are expected to send 75 billion yuan
back to their families, or 2,000 yuan per head, much higher than
the average income of impoverished households, the Ministry says.
</P>
<P>
A decade ago, few farmers were willing to go looking for jobs
in other places, but these days, more of them have left home for
work elsewhere. And. what was just wandering at the beginning has
gradually given way to better organized labor services, with local
governments joining the effort and providing labor market
information. Transient workers have also become a way to balance
out the effects of bad harvests.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Receives More Income Taxes From Foreigners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Foreigners living in the
Chinese capital paid Income taxes totalling 1.22 billion yuan (146
million US dollars) in 1997, according to today's Beijing Youth
Daily.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted the Beijing Municipal Local Taxation Bureau as
saying that the figure represented 33.6 percent of the total tax
revenues collected from foreign businesses and individuals in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Beijing's rapid economic development guaranteed rising income
for foreigners and led to rising tax revenues from related
individuals, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The paper said 50 percent of foreign taxpayers were taxed at
rates of over 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
The majority of taxpayers were from the United States, Japan,
and Germany, with smaller numbers coming from various other
foreign countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
The sound economic situation which allowed foreign-funded
ventures and foreign agencies to recruit additional staff was yet
another factor leading to rising income tax revenue.

<P>
Sichuan Province in southwestern China has five million
transient workers elsewhere who are making 14 billion yuan
annually. Gansu Province in the northwest has set up 8,000 labor
service centers in eastern and central parts of the country
handling two million laborers who are bringing in 1.6 billion yuan
each, according to Gao Hongbin, director of the State Council's
aid-the-poor project office.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank has good things to say about this poverty-relief
method with Chinese characteristics, and has made it part of an
anti-poverty project in 35 counties in southwestern China. The
project is said to have yielded good results for 138,700 poor
farmers.
</P>
<P>
Labor exports have provided a balance of the labor resources in
the western parts and the capital and technology in the eastern
parts. Fujian, for example, has set up eight labor service centers
and special poverty relief funds to provide job training for
arriving laborers, Gao explains.
</P>
<P>
Transient labor is now a priority item for governments in the
central part in arranging work to alleviate poverty. The eastern
and central parts of the country will build more labor service
centers to attract another 600,000 poor farmers from western and
central parts away from their hometowns to look for a better life.
</P>
<P>
China still has 58 million poor rural people, and wants to wipe
out poverty by the end of the century.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Marks 150th Anniversary of Gold Rush </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 24 (Xinhua) -- A series of events are
taking place in California to mark the 150th anniversary of the
Gold Rush, a large-scale and hasty movement of people to this
western U.S. state in the mid-19th century.
</P>
<P>
Exactly 150 years ago, on January 24, 1848, a carpenter spotted
a pea-sized nugget glinting beneath the surface of the American
River in northern California.
</P>
<P>
This led to the next year's California Gold Rush, when tens of
thousands of fortune-seekers from other states as well as Mexico,
Europe, Asia and South America swarmed in. California's
population skyrocketed from 12,000 non-Indians in 1848 to 300,000
only six years later. At one point in 1849, San Francisco's
population was doubling every 10 days. It became the largest
voluntary migration the world has ever seen.
</P>
<P>
The Oakland Museum of California opened a three-part exhibition
Saturday entitled "Gold Rush! California's Untold Stories," with
artifacts, paintings and film footage exploring the impacts and
stereotypes of the period.
</P>
<P>
This morning, at the Gold Discovery State Historic Park, a
re-enactment of the gold discovery took place, and a new Gold Rush
Research Library was dedicated. Other events including sports will
take place in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Historians say that the Gold Rush shaped who Californians are
as a people -- risk takers, eccentrics and innovators. The era's
emotions, tragedies and successes established a pattern that
repeats every 20 or 30 years, with oil, redwoods, aerospace,
Okies, Hollywood, and now with Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
According to organizers of the celebration events, negative
effects of the Gold Rush will be addressed.
</P>
<P>
Violence and xenophobia rages during the Gold Rush, which
generated California's remarkable cultural diversity and also
resulted in the virtual annihilation of the indigenous
Indians.
</P>
<P>
Before the first European arrived, some 300,000 Indians lived
in the state. Twenty years later, their numbers were reduced to
only 30,000 as the result of slaying and diseases.
</P>
<P>
Many history books described how the Gold Rush was a cruel time
period especially for Chinese immigrants.
</P>
<P>
At the start of the Gold Rush, there were only a few hundreds
Chinese living in California. In 1852 alone 20,000 more
arrived. By 1870, they made up a quarter of the state's workforce.
</P>
<P>
Historians say that the Chinese were seen as valuable laborers
when gold was still abundant. But as soon as the gold supply was
exhausted, the immigrants became scapegoats.
</P>
<P>
The ani-immigrant sentiment directed at the Chinese, who
quickly became the largest non-white group in California, was
particularly harsh. In 1852 the California governor denounced the
Chinese as "coolies" and lawmakers then approved a foreign miners'
tax aimed at them. Until 1870 when the law was repealed, the tax
brought in up to 50 percent all state revenues. Like blacks and
Indians, the Chinese were prohibited from testifying against
whites in California's courts.
</P>
<P>
The Gold Rush also drew writers, artists and other
intellectuals to California. Historians say that the most
extraordinary thing about the Gold Rush is that it set the tone
for so much of what has happened in California. Almost all of the
major social, economic and political currents in the state today,
such as ethnic tensions, overpopulation, environmental degradation
and water supplies, developed during the period and have
essentially persisted ever since.

<HEADLINE> China Clears 10 Million Sq.M. of Minefields on Vietnam Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese soldiers in the Guangxi
Zhuang Autonomous Region have cleared 10 million square meters of
ground with minefields along the Vietnamese border in two
operations.
</P>
<P>
The first began in the early 1990s when China and Vietnam
restored relations and the second in November, 1997 on 120
minefields on nearly 20 million sq.m. of ground.
</P>
<P>
During the first-phase of this operation, from November 28 to
January 25, 1.1 million sq.m. of ground was cleared and tens of
thousands of mines, in 18 different types, removed, according to
Qiu Daxiong, deputy commander of the Guangxi Military Area
Command.
</P>
<P>
One soldier lost his right foot while rescuing another soldier
who had lost his balance and fallen onto a minefield.
</P>
<P>
The soldiers have stopped the operation for the approaching of
Spring Festival, which starts January 28, and is the most
important festival for both of the countries.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam gave a positive response to China's minesweeping
operations and the foreign affairs department of its Quang Ninh
Province sent a letter to the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region
recently to express support for the operation, which has cost 78
million yuan (9.4 million US dollars) in government funds so far.
</P>
<P>
A senior Chinese military official says the second minesweeping
operation is intended to further develop Chinese-Vietnamese
friendship and help boost the border economy.
</P>
<P>
Sino-Vietnamese border trade grew from 100 million dollars in
1992 to 360 million dollars in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Koreans Develops Tourism in Northeast China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, January 25 (Xinhua) -- China and the Republic of
Korea (ROK) are cooperating in tourism in the Changbai Mountains
in the eastern part of northeast China's Jilin Province on the
border with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
</P>
<P>
The area is known for its forests and has some 300,000 tourists
each year, most from the ROK. The development of tourist resources
there has gotten the support of the United Nations Development
Program Beijing Secretariat to increase international cooperation
in the Tumen River area, east of the mountains.
</P>
<P>
The Jilin Changbai Mountain Tourism Development Co. Ltd., a
joint venture of the Provincial Administration of the Changbai
Mountain State Nature Reserve and a ROK architect and engineering
group, was started in Changchun, the capital of Jilin, on December
28.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, the joint venture plans to invest 45
million yuan (about 5.42 million U.S. dollars) in constructing a
reception center for tourism at Changbai Mountains. The center
will be situated outside the main gate of the State Nature Reserve
of Changbai Mountain and will have a construction area of 9,600
sq. m.
</P>
<P>
Work on the center will begin in May of this year and is
scheduled for completion in August of 1999.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese will invest 45 percent of the capital in the form
of land rights and the ROK will put in 55 percent of the total
investment in the 30-year cooperative management.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Confident of Filipinos' Unity Despite Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 25 (Xinhua) -- President Fidel Ramos Sunday
expressed confidence in the unity of the 70 million Filipino
people in surmounting current economic difficulties caused by the
financial turmoil sweeping Asia.
</P>
<P>
"In spite of this economic hardship, I am confident that the
unity of the people will be maintained and maybe even enhanced
because there is a unifying effect of hardship and crisis as our
people have demonstrated over the year," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the people's unity would not be disrupted since all the
presidential aspirants and their political parties have vowed to
pursue the Ramos administration's programs for economic reforms,
sustainable development, alleviation of poverty and social equity.
</P>
<P>
Ramos added that he has called for the holding of an economic
summit on February 11, during which representatives from all walks
of life would discuss ways and means to overcome the currency
turmoil.
</P>
<P>
Since July last year, the Philippine currency, the peso, has
devaluated by some 64 percent to the current level of 43.96 pesos
per U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the currency spintail, the country's economy has
slowed down. Prices of prime commodities have increased by an
average of 10 percent, bringing difficulties to both the rich and
the poor.

<P>
MACAO, January 25 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official in
Macao said on Sunday that the preparatory committee for the future
 Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR) will be established
this year.
</P>
<P>
Wang Qiren, director of the Xinhua News Agency Macao Branch,
said in a reception for the Chinese Lunar New Year that the
preparation for the resumption of exercise of sovereignty over
Macao will enter a new stage in 1998.
</P>
<P>
"The preparatory committee for the Macao SAR will be
established this year," he said. "The preparation for China's
resumption of exercise of sovereignty over Macao will thus be
materialized."
</P>
<P>
Wang said that a smooth transition and handover will be
realized under the effective cooperation between China and
Portugal and the joint efforts of different aspects of society, so
 long as the transition is conducted in accordance with the policy
 of "one country, two systems" and the spirits of the Macao Basic
Law.
</P>
<P>
Progress has been achieved over the past year in affairs
related to Macao's transition and preparation for the handover,
Wang said, adding that "all preparatory work for the return of
Macao is being done in good order."

<HEADLINE> HK Financial Chief Rules out Tax Cuts in Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Financial Secretary of the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) Donald Tsang
Yam-kuen has hinted that there will be no tax cuts or big
public-spending increases in the first budget of the SAR.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on Hong Kong Radio's program Saturday, Tsang stressed
that the financial blueprint for the coming year would focus on
long-term development.
</P>
<P>
He said: "It is possible to give Hong Kong people a short-term
elation, setting aside the long-term benefits." "But it would be
irresponsible and even dangerous to seek temporary applause from
the public with the taxpayer's hard-earned money," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The 1998-1999 budget, the first for the SAR since the handover
on July 1, 1997, will be released at the Provisional Legislative
Council on February 18.
</P>
<P>
Despite widespread calls for tax cuts and public-expenditure
increases, Tsang pointed out, the International Monetary Fund and
other organizations have warned that such a course of action could
severely harm Hong Kong's economy.
</P>
<P>
"A few weeks ago, a neighboring government (in Southeast Asia)
announced an increase of 32 percent in expenditure in its 1998
budget and, immediately, the markets had negative reactions," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"There was a great loss of foreign currency and their own
currency devalued drastically. This is an important pointer to
Hong Kong," Tsang added.

<HEADLINE> Smell Of Gunpowder In Peacetime, Minesweeping On The Vietnam Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By Wang Mancang and Wu Xiaojun
</P>
<P>
NANNING, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Bao Weihua was crawling on
hands and knees across a hillside covered with wild grass, holding
an anti-personnel mine the size of a bowl, in his left hand, while
with his right he defused it.
</P>
<P>
With the removal of this last mine in this particular minefield
on Faca Mountain on the Sino-Vietnamese border, Bao and the other
soldiers in his minesweeping team who were stationed in nearby
Pingxiang had completed their final mission before the Spring
Festival and were able to return to battalion headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Qiu Daxiong, deputy commander of the Guangxi Military Area
Command, announced that, as of January 25, troops in China's
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region had cleared the mines from 1.1
million sq.m. of ground. This meant removing tens of thousands of
mines in 18 different types in China's second minesweeping
operation that began on November 28, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Qiu, who was the deputy head of the Guangxi Minesweeping Lead
Group, says that nearly 10 million sq.m. of mined areas have been
cleared along the Guangxi part of the 637-km. border with Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Millions of mines were planted 20 years ago during the
Sino-Vietanmese border war and Guangxi has 386 minefields on 30
million sq.m. of ground.
</P>
<P>
Qiu says that the plan is to clear more than 120 areas on 20
million sq.m. of land in the three-year minesweeping operation.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Shangzhong, head of one team in Ningming, says that
ordinary people can hardly imagine the danger and difficulties of
minesweeping work. In those areas, the mines are usually on
hillsides with a more than 50-degree slope that are covered with
grass as tall as a man and thorny undergrowth.
</P>
<P>
Each soldier has to carry 20-kg of explosives and tools and
walk five hours before they reach the site in Tongjin.

<P>
The soldiers' clothes are soaked with sweat, even in winter. And
even though strict precautions have been taken, one soldier lost
his right feet while trying to get out another soldier who had
slipped onto a minefield on a 70-degree slope.
</P>
<P>
The usual method, he said, is to explode the mines under a
shallow cover of earth. At one site, the soldiers were seen put
explosives on two-meter-long wooden poles and set them off.
</P>
<P>
After that, engineers with special protective gear follow the
path of the explosions inch by inch to look for mines with mine
detectors. They remove the fuse and tie the mines together to
explode them.
</P>
<P>
Qiu said that Sino-Vietnamese relations have been improving
over the past few years with visits of top leaders and border
negotiations, and the purpose of the minesweeping operation is to
promote Sino-Vietnamese relations and the border economy.
</P>
<P>
The first minesweeping operation started in 1993 and more than
600,000 mines were removed during a two-year period. The operation
helped open 25 border areas for trade and nine ports of entry.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that a mine only costs three to five dollars but
that it takes a lot more than that to remove it. So far, the
Chinese government has spent 78 million yuan (9.4 million dollars)
on the minesweeping operations.
</P>
<P>
But, since mines planted as thick as watermelons in a patch
were removed at Puzhai in 1994, residential buildings have sprung
up along with hotels, restaurants, and stores, and it has become a
popular border trade place.
</P>
<P>
According to the Guangxi border trade department, annual
Sino-Vietnamese border trade grew from 100 million dollars in 1992
to 360 million dollars in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Cai Ziliang, deputy head of the China Academy of Forestry
Science's Tropical Zone Foresty Institute, says that because these
areas are semi-tropical, the vegetation can return soon and newly
planted trees are doing well in the former minefields.

<HEADLINE> Mobs Set Fire to Vehicles in Bomb-ravaged Sri </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Three vehicles in Kandy, which
was rocked by a powerful explosion Sunday morning, were set on
fire by a large number of mobs following the blasts, according to
news reaching here Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
On the streets of Kandy, the ancient Sri Lankan capital, at
least 500 people chanted anti-Tamil slogans and began attacking a
Hindu temple in town hours after the explosion took place.
</P>
<P>
Three vehicles were set on fire while several shops on one
street were damaged.
</P>
<P>
Police intervened and used tear gas to disperse the angry
crowd.
</P>
<P>
Police sources said the situation could turn worse as evening
is approaching.
</P>
<P>
The revengeful mobs attacked the Hindu temple because Hindu is
the religion of the Tamil people.
</P>
<P>
Three Tamil rebels driving in an explosive-laden truck Sunday
morning tried to destroy the holiest shrine of the Sinhala people,
the Tooth Relic Temple, when they rammed through a police
checkpoint near the temple.
</P>
<P>
The death toll of the bombing attack has risen to 12 as three
more wounded persons succumbed to their injuries.
</P>
<P>
A local radio station said 29 others were injured. Five of the
dead have been identified.
</P>
<P>
In a local hospital in Kandy, which lies 115 kilometers east of
Colombo, surgeons are busy treating the wounded.
</P>
<P>
Local reports said there are enough doctors and the blood bank
there has sufficient supply.
</P>
<P>
This was the first major attack launched by the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) against the Golden Jubilee
celebrations of Sri Lanka's independence from Britain 50 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
The major function of the 50th independence day anniversary is
scheduled for February 4 in Kandy, to be attended by Sri Lankan
President Chandrika Kumaratunga, Prince Charles and many other
foreign dignitaries.

<HEADLINE> Project Helps Poor Cataract Patients in East China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Although Zheng Yuxia, a farmer
in Zhangbu village in east China's Fujian Province, has been
married for 26 years, she had no idea what her husband looked like
because she was a cataract-sufferer who could not afford the
operation.
</P>
<P>
Zheng could not help crying when she first saw her husband
after cataract-removal surgery by doctors from the Regaining
Eyesight Project (REP), which provides free operations for poor
cataract patients.
</P>
<P>
Zheng was fortunate to be one of 3,494 who had their eyesight
restored in the east China province after the local government
wanted to "do something practical for cataract patients" and
launched the project last year.
</P>
<P>
Cataracts are the leading cause of blindness in China. The
incidence of cataract-caused blindness has not been brought under
control because most of the victims cannot afford surgery or other
treatment.
</P>
<P>
The project, the first of its kind in China, was sponsored by
the local government to cover all the medical costs of cataract
patients.
</P>
<P>
The local government has sent 40 medical teams to rural areas
of the province to give free operations to patients who live in
poverty.
</P>
<P>
Among 90,000 cataract sufferers in Fujian, more than half are
unable to work; 12 percent cannot get around to take care of
themselves; and 9.8 percent cannot even walk, adding financial
burdens for their families.
</P>
<P>
Some 47,048 patients have received the surgery in the last two
years.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that out of nine million people suffering from
visual impairment, about four million have cataracts with 400,000
new cases reported in China each year, according to the Ministry
of Health.

<HEADLINE> Guangzhou Residents Enjoy Adequate Housing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Housing used to be a hot
topic in Guangzhou, capital of south China's Guangdong
Province. But no more.
</P>
<P>
Local residents have been provided with a per-capita living
space of 11.36 square meters, compared to the national standard of
12 square meters set for the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
"I had been troubled by the housing problem for most of my
life. but now I have moved into a new flat," said retired worker
Du Shijie. The 63-square-meter flat cost him 120,000 yuan (15,000
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
This is part of the city's effort to solve housing problems for
the needy. Guangzhou has built five residential districts during
the last few years to provide housing for more than 20,000
families involving nearly 100,000 people.
</P>
<P>
Increasingly spacious housing was attributed to a project begun
11 years ago, and the intensified housing-system reform.
</P>
<P>
The city began in 1989 to sell state-owned houses, and by the
end of 1997 had sold 270,000 apartments involving 3.3 billion yuan
in sales, which became a fund reserve for more housing.
</P>
<P>
Guangzhou has basically solved housing difficulties for
families with less than 5 square meters of living space per
capita, said vice mayor Dai Zhiguo.
</P>
<P>
Households in Guangzhou average 52.36 square meters of living
space which ranks first among Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin and
Chongqing, according to a recent survey by the State Statistics
Bureau.

<HEADLINE> Israel on Alert for Possible Terror Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Israel's security force is on
high alert for possible attacks by radical Islamic groups, which
may follow Hamas leader's call to launch a "holy war" against
Israeli occupation, the Jerusalem Post daily reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The daily quoted Jerusalem Police Chief Yair Yitzhaki as saying
that the security force has got intelligence about terrorists who
have stockpiled weapons and planned to carry out attacks in the
coming days.
</P>
<P>
Yitzhaki said that Israeli troops and police will maintain a
beefed-up presence in the main cities.
</P>
<P>
The founder and spiritual leader of the Islamic Hamas movement
(Hamas) Ahmed Yassin Saturday called on Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat to join his movement in
waging a "holy war" against the Israeli "occupiers."
</P>
<P>
"I do not recognize Israel and I am not ready to wait for the
outcome of dialog and negotiations (between the PNA and Israel),"
said Yassin.
</P>
<P>
He called on all the Palestinians to unite in an armed struggle
against Israel, which he said is the only way for the Palestinians
to gain their rights and achieve their goals, including the
establishment of an independent state.
</P>
<P>
Israel's security force has been watchful since the beginning
of the Muslim holy month Ramadan at the end of last month.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, clashes happened on Saturday night when dozens of
Palestinians threw rocks and empty bottles in the Old City of
Jerusalem at Israeli policemen, who fired rubber bullets in
response, and wounded two Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> Illegal Car Clearing Syndicate Unearthed in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 24 (Xinhua) -- An illegal car clearing
syndicate has been unearthed in Lusaka by police, Sunday Times
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
A house in the sprawling Matero township was used to clear
unlicensed vehicles and equipped with all necessary facilities
for forging documents, according to the local newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Six vehicle registration books, two Interpol motor vehicle
clearance certificates, two identity road traffic act
certificates and one Interpol date stamp were found, police said.
</P>
<P>
Police spokesman Beenwell Chimfwembe said one Tiger Insurance
date stamp, a road traffic department date stamp, a Zambia State
Insurance Corporation certificate of insurance, a date stamp ink
pad and an empty ink container were also recovered from the
houses.
</P>
<P>
Several people including the owner of the house have been
arrested.
</P>
<P>
The arrests were made as a result of a tip off from members of
the public who became suspicious of the number of cars
frequenting the house.
</P>
<P>
Sources were quoted as saying that the unscrupulous
businessmen have been making roaring business clearing cars, some
of which are stolen from the neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Late last year the government embarked on a clean up campaign
of vehicle licences in which they introduced what they called
fool proof features. The illegal syndicate has however been
elusive.

WASHINGTON -- The Democrats, including U.S. President Bill
Clinton's longtime allies, are urging the president to explain his
relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky
quickly.
</P>
<P>
Many Democrats worry that the alleged affair and an
investigation into whether Clinton tried to cover it up will
overshadow the State of the Union address. Tuesday's speech is a
high-profile kickoff of the Democrats' push to challenge the
Republicans' control of Congress.
</P>
<P>
Many Democrats agree that Clinton will ride this storm out.
They just hope he does it soon. (US-Clinton-Scandal)

<HEADLINE> Iranian President: Chaos Not Allowed in Civilized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami has stressed that in an advanced and civilized society,
chaos and breach of law are neither tolerable nor rational, the
Iranian English newspaper Iran News said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Everyone is obliged to observe the law and whoever violates the
law will cause disorder and harm to the society, and will be
punished according to law, Khatami said Saturday while meeting
with members who hold ceremony to mark the Islamic Revolution.
</P>
<P>
"No group should allow itself to consider its own taste above
the law and to resort to means whereby to impose its taste on the
society," he said.
</P>
<P>
Khatami's criticism is apparently directed against the radical
factions which recently have caused political and social chaos by
beating members of rival factions, blocking their activities and
even storming public facilities in many parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
A radical group "Ansar-e Hezbollah" violently barred people in
various cities, including Tehran, from attending the memorial
ceremonies for Iran's late prime minister Mehdi Bazargan, founder
of the Freedom Movement of Iran.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian Interior Ministry has strongly condemned the
unlawful acts and deployed hundreds of riot police in Tehran
Thursday to keep order at a postponed memorial ceremony for
Bazargan.
</P>
<P>
Khatami said people have the full right to participate in
activities related to religion, national interests, and other
events despite the fact that they may have different values,
outlooks and views.
</P>
<P>
"We should try to assimilate people despite their differences
and we should also accept the norms of law, discipline and order
which are essential in the community to prevent any form of
anarchism," he added.
</P>
<P>
He contended that differences in views can not be eliminated by
force and that efforts must be made to keep the differences within
the framework of law to contribute to social progress.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, January 25 (Xinhua) -- China's Hebei Province
plans to raise to 30 the number of enterprises groups each with a
sales volume of more than five billion yuan over the next three
years.
</P>
<P>
The province will also help 70 enterprises with sales of from
one billion yuan to five billion yuan and will ease controls on
medium-sized and small enterprises, Governor Ye Liansong told
Xinhua recently.
</P>
<P>
He said the province now has 29 major enterprises groups and
plans to establish large enterprises groups in pharmaceuticals,
petrochemicals, iron and steel, glass, ceramics, chemicals,
chemical fibers, and wine, this year.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, the province will make structural and
organizational adjustments in enterprises to do this in accordance
with the revised national economic and social development plan in
the Ninth Five-Year-Plan (1996-2000) and long-term-goals for 2010.
</P>
<P>
There will be 10 enterprises groups with more than 10 billion
yuan in sales each and flexible measures to help transform
medium-sized and small enterprises and to improve their
efficiency, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that he hopes the strategy will mean that more
local enterprises can be part of China's top 500 companies and its

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Plans to Export Computer Software </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The Computer Association of
Nigeria (COAN) has initiated a frantic effort to launch
Nigerian-made computer software products into the international
market, aiming at working toward self-reliance in information
technology in the next century.
</P>
<P>
To achieve this goal, COAN has directed its members to harness
all available intellectual capabilities to streamline standards
along international level for software development, the Guardian
reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
COAN believes Nigeria can also benefit from the multi-billion
U.S. Dollars global software industry through export of local
products, the national newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Considering a structured plan between the year 1997 and 2000,
it is believed that Nigeria will achieve the expected height in
software development if the government could set down deliberate
policies for achieving the goal.
</P>
<P>
Such policies are expected to come in form of government
support through provision of locations, infrastructure and an
enabling environment.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted a source close to COAN leadership as
saying that the association has submitted a position paper to
representatives of the government.
</P>
<P>
Included in the position paper is the establishment of
software research and development centers across the country to
train professionals in software engineering, design and produce
world-standard software, promote and export locally-produced
software and research and disseminate new software technologies.
</P>
<P>
It is likely to be adopted by the government, the source said.
</P>
<P>
Convinced that the nation possesses ample skilled manpower to
develop competitive packages, COAN is advocating that each of the
research centers be provided with 100 percent funding by the
government in the first three years before it is finally phased
out.
</P>
<P>
It also urges the government to provide office space for the
centers in Africa, Asia, Europe and America as well as ensure an
enabling environment for collaborative work and partnerships with
foreign firms.
</P>
<P>
An external liaison structure to include collaboration with
the ISO with regard to software quality is also being requested.
</P>
<P>
Such steps will help build mutual confidence and overcome any
negative perceptions of software developed in Nigeria, it says.

<HEADLINE> Donors Urged to Assist in Rectifying El Nino </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Kenya has urged donor
countries and non-governmental organizations to assist in
rectifying the El Nino damages suffered in the country during the
past three months.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Nation Sunday quoted Peter Ondieki, Deputy Director
in the Department of Development Co-ordination, as saying that
the government would need 8 billion Kenyan Shillings (about 130
million U.S. Dollars) to rectify the damages.
</P>
<P>
He was delivering a public lecture on the El Nino, its effects
and strategies for future mitigation at the University of Nairobi
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Ondieki noted that the money would be needed in the next three
years to sponsor humanitarian programs in the affected areas.
</P>
<P>
Part of the money will be used to help resettle families
marooned by floods caused by the El Nino phenomenon in different
parts of the country, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to Ondieki, his department had so far distributed
7,200 tons of maize, 665 tons of beans and 60 tons of assorted
drugs to flood-stricken areas.
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion, Leonard Njau, assistant director of
research in the Department of Meteorology, said the 1997 El Nino
was the strongest one experienced in the past 100 years in the
east African country.
</P>
<P>
The devastating effects of the El Nino, he noted, would be
felt for a long time to come in the agricultural, energy,
transport, tourism and wildlife sectors.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day African leaders' forum just concluded in
Uganda, World Bank President James Wolfensohn announced that the
bank would send a special mission to Kenya to assess the
destruction caused by the El Nino rains for possible assistance.

<P>
The civilians got through several blocks and gathered at the

</P>
<P>
They chanted slogans to show their anger about the attack. Many

</P>
<P>
Local radio reports said many of the residents in Kandy said
they could hardly believe such an incident could take place in the
vicinity of their holiest shrine, the Tooth Relic Temple, also
call Dalada Maligawa in Sinhala.
</P>
<P>
Police guarding the area later dispersed them to prevent any
incidents from taking place.
</P>
<P>
Local radio reports said anti-riot police were also called in.
</P>
<P>
Earlier police had called on the locals to refrain from
visiting the scene.
</P>
<P>
The latest news said that nine people were killed in the
attack, including three rebels of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam who staged the attack.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Zambian Rights Body Seeks Release of Prohibited </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Zambian human rights body has
intervened in the case of six prohibited immigrants who have been
languishing in two Lusaka jails for more than eight years without
trial, Sunday Times of Zambia reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The paper said five South Africans and a Malawian who have
become virtually stateless because their countries of origin have
disowned them, were arrested over eight years ago and the
government does not know what to do with them.
</P>
<P>
Justice Lombe Chibesakunda, chairperson of Zambian Permenent
Human Rights Commission, confirmed that she has met senior
officials in the Ministry of Home Affairs to try and secure the
release and deportation of the men.
</P>
<P>
However, when contacted for comment, Home Affairs Minister
Peter Machungwa said he was not aware of the case but promised to
take it up with his officers who he believed may have been
handling the issue, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
It quoted sources as saying that the prohibited immigrants are
part of scores of aliens who were rounded up on the central
Copperbelt during an infamous "operation clean up" conducted by
police in the Second Republic.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of west Africans attracted by the mineral rich
Copperbelt were airlifted back to their countries of origin but
the six were unfortunate because their countries rejected them,
said the paper.

<P>
BEIJING, January 25 (Xinhua) -- China used more than 51.9
billion US dollars of direct foreign investment in 1997, which
brought the total amount of overseas investment used over the past
two decades to 360 billion dollars, latest statistics show.
</P>
<P>
Utilization of overseas funds has become an important aspect in
the country's opening-up drive, greatly easing the shortage of
funds in China's economic construction.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992, China has greatly increased the speed of absorbing
overseas funds and has ranked first among developing countries in
using foreign funds over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
During the 1992-1996 period, overseas investors actually put a
total of 151.54 billion US dollars in China, which accounted for
13.94 percent of the country's total fixed asset investment.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that among the total amount of overseas funds
used, direct foreign investment amounted to 220 billion dollars
and overseas loans came to 139 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Thai Economy Shows Signs of Recovery: US Businessman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 25 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. businessman sees
Thailand's economic problems as showing some good signs of
recovery in view of American business.
</P>
<P>
Ernest Bower, president of the U.S.-ASEAN Business Council,
said Thailand's crisis is economic, not political, and the Chuan
Leekpai government is taking steps to fix it, the Bangkok Post
Sunday quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said a concrete way to help Thailand and ASEAN cope with the
economic crisis is to reinvest in the region, and U.S. business is
very committed to it, Bower said.
</P>
<P>
Bower, who is on a tour of ASEAN countries to boost the U.S.
backing to the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) scheme, said that
portfolio money will come back when American businesses see
foreign direct investment coming back.
</P>
<P>
If the baht can stabilize, Thailand will see more foreign
direct investment coming in, Bower said.
</P>
<P>
According to him, new investment will be coming in if U.S.
companies can move such products as auto parts and food around the
globe or around the region.
</P>
<P>
He said American business sees auto-related, electronics and
food processing industries as potential investment areas in
Thailand once AFTA is seriously implemented and accelerated.
</P>
<P>
Bower is scheduled to leave Thailand for the Philippines on
Sunday to continue his tour of some members of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
</P>
<P>
Besides Thailand, he has already visited Indonesia and
Malaysia. Other ASEAN members are Brunei, Singapore, Vietnam, Laos
and Myanmar.

<HEADLINE> Commonwealth Games Sponsors Backing out: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's economic crisis
may force some sponsors to abandon their pledges for the
Commonwealth Games here in September, a local report said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"There may be a shortfall in the projected revenues as some of
the companies who have pledged their support are not honouring
them," Sports Minister Muhyiddin Yassin was quoted as saying by
the New Sunday Times newspaper.
</P>
<P>
"We will have to look elsewhere to break even," the minister
added.
</P>
<P>
Since last July, the ringgit has depreciated by more than 40
percent to the dollar, while the stock market has lost about half
of its market capitalisation.
</P>
<P>
Muhyiddin said two bus companies that had promised to provide
services during the games backed out, leaving a big hole in the
organiser's transport plans.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian government early this year said it had cut the
budget for the Commonwealth Games by five percent.
</P>
<P>
But Malaysia is confident the games, to be held from September
11 to September 21, would serve as a catalyst to boost the
country's battered economy instead of imposing a burden.

this year.
</P>
<P>
With the "city and countryside tour" as the major theme, the

<HEADLINE> Reforms Shake Up Chinese Shipyards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 25 (Xinhua) -- China's shipbuilding industry
is striving to implement restructuring through stock issue,
mergers, sell-offs and lay-offs in a bid to enhance its
competitiveness in the world market.
</P>
<P>
The China State Shipbuilding Corp (CSSC) is considering forming
three large shipbuilding groups based in Dalian in northeast
China, Shanghai in east China and Guangzhou in south China this
year, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
A string of shipyards, shipways and technical renovation
projects are expected to be completed by 2000, including the
shanghai Waigaoqiao shipyard, a 100,000-ton shipway in Bohai
shipyard, and a 150,000-ton dry-dock in Shanhaiguan Shipyard.
</P>
<P>
The country's overall production capacity is expected to be
raised substantially from the current 2.5 million dwt when
proposed mergers between shipbuilders affiliated to different
ministries, authorities and cities materialize, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to Guangzhou Ship International Co Ltd in Hong Kong
and Jiangnan Heavy Industrial Co Ltd listed in Shanghai, CSSC is
urging the Dalian Group, Jiangnan Group and Fengfan Storage
Battery Group to speed up their corporate restructuring to meet
the requirements of raising funds in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
Also, CSSC plans to lay off about 30,000 workers this year as
part of its scheme to offload 90,000 staff within three years.
</P>
<P>
The major advantage of Chinese shipmakers over their Japanese
and South Korean rivals lies in the lower cost of their technical
labor. However, over the past few years, surging wages and
increasing numbers of temporary rural workers have bitten into
profitability badly, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The productivity of the average worker is set to reach 150,000
yuan (18,072 US dollars) a year by 2000, compared with 83,000 yuan
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Revenue from the non-production service sector of CSSC, which
will absorb many of the laid-off workers, will reach 10 billion
yuan by 2000.

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The former ruling Serb
Democratic Party (SDS) and the Radical Party, baking away from
confrontation, has recognized the legitimacy of a new government
led by Milorad Dodik.
</P>
<P>
The move came after Serb National Council Chairman Dragan Kalinic
received a letter from the High Representative to Bosnia Carlos
Westendorp Friday, in which the latter expressed support for the
Dodik government.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting held later in the evening, Serb parliamentary
parties decided to support the Dodik government and agreed to hold
a parliamentary session on January 31 to swear in the new
government.
</P>
<P>
The Deputy High Representative to Bosnia, Hans Schumacher,
praised the decision and called on the parliament to swear in the
new government "as soon as possible."
</P>
<P>
This round of confrontation began on January 17, when Serb
President Biljana Plavsic nominated Dodik as the new prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
As a moderate who has denounced the ideology of the SDS, Dodik
met strong opposition from the SDS and the Radical Party. But he
managed to get the support of a narrow parliamentary majority at
the absence of 39 SDS and Radical Party deputies on January 18.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Proposes Plan to Fight Medicare Fraud, Waste </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Saturday proposed measures to clamp down on Medicare cheaters and
eliminate wasteful practices leading to government overpay for
everything from drugs to wheelchairs.
</P>
<P>
"Medicare fraud is a real crime, committed by real criminals,
intent on stealing from the system and cheating our most
vulnerable citizens," Clinton said in his weekly radio address.
</P>
<P>
His anti-fraud plan is expected to save Medicare, the federal
health care program for the elderly, more than 2 billion
U.S. dollars over five years, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
The proposed plan will be included in the 1999 budget that
Clinton will submit to Congress next month.
</P>
<P>
Existing anti-fraud efforts yielded nearly 1 billion dollars in
fines and settlements for health care fraud in 1997, Clinton
said. But cheaters still are bilking the system.

<HEADLINE> Uygur Farmers Become Prosperous Through Livestock Breeding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Uygur farmers in northwest
China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region have been doing well
through the breeding of more sheep and cattle.
</P>
<P>
Dazhuangzi Village of Turpan city is a good example. Of the
village's 165 households, 70 percent raise more than 50 heads of
sheep each. Farmers earned 1.5 million yuan in net profit from the
business in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Abliz Ayup is among the most outstanding. The 42-year-old
farmer began the efforts in 1985 when he, then a village tractor
driver, found it profitable to breed livestock.
</P>
<P>
He used all his savings to buy 40 to 50 heads of sheep to start
his new career. By the end of 1997, Abliz had expanded his
livestock farm to 1,500 heads of sheep and 100 heads of cattle.
</P>
<P>
"I have three stalls at the city meat wholesale market. To tell
the truth, I earned 670,000 yuan last year, and paid 25,000 yuan
in taxes and other fees," he said.
</P>
<P>
The farmer has toured most parts of Xinjiang, and even
neighboring Gansu and Qinghai provinces, to buy sheep and cattle
of fine breed.
</P>
<P>
Abliz has nearly 1.5 ha of forage land, and stores fodder worth
50,000 yuan every winter.
</P>
<P>
The ambitious Uygur plans to spend 100,000 yuan in 1998
building a 1.3-ha modern farm to sell 4,000 heads of sheep
annually.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese authorities are
tightening control of imports of second-hand foreign consumer
electrical goods following large number of substandard appliances
are seized.
</P>
<P>
According to the People's Daily, most imported second-hand air
conditioners, television sets, refrigerators selling on the
second-hand markets in Hainan Island are found to fail to meet
standards.
</P>
<P>
Problems with these goods, usually sold at one fifth or two
thirds of the price of the new product, include substandard
voltage, rusted parts, and heavily-accumulated interior dust, the
Daily said.
</P>
<P>
Relevant state regulations restrict the importation of old
consumer electronics and stipulate that these goods can only be
used for raw materials.
</P>
<P>
A survey found that no imported old electronic goods selling in
Hainan can present a certificate from the commodity inspection
authorities.
</P>
<P>
A call has been issued persuading Chinese consumers not to buy
such goods.
</P>
<P>
Those goods found failing to meet the state compulsory
standards will be confiscated or destroyed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in principle, no approval will be rendered to the
importation of second-hand consumer electronics, the Daily
said.

<HEADLINE> Thai Prime Minister Invited to Visit Washington </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Chuan
Leekpai will visit Washington in March for talks with U.S.
President Bill Clinton on ways to head off the on-going financial
crisis in Thailand and the region.
</P>
<P>
Thai Deputy Foreign Minister Sukhumbhand Paribatra disclosed
that the invitation came during Thai Finance Minister Tarrin
Nimmanahaeminda's visit to Washington, according to the local
press Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The invitation "shows the U.S. government's serious concern
about the economic problems Thailand is fighting," Sukhumbhand
said.
</P>
<P>
Tarrin met Clinton and Vice President Al Gore on Saturday at
the White House. But press reports said Tarrin fell short of
winning U.S. financial support Thailand needed to tide over the
current financial difficulty.
</P>
<P>
Chuan has confirmed that he has received the invitation but
declined to comment on the up-coming talks with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Thai Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan said the meeting between
Chuan and Clinton would provide an opportunity to discuss measures
needed to rejuvenate the economic of the region.
</P>
<P>
"The invitation from President Clinton must involve important
issues, otherwise it would not be a bilateral meeting," Surin
said.
</P>
<P>
Thailand and some other Asian nations have been gripped by
financial turbulence leading to the downturn of their economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government is trying hard to rally international
support, notably from the United States, which is widely seen as
having neglected Thailand in its hour of need.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 25 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's military has
confirmed that the serious bombing blasts early Sunday morning
were conducted by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE),
sources close to the military said.
</P>
<P>
So far eight people have been killed and 25 others injured due
to the attack.
</P>
<P>
The latest information from police said that two bombs exploded
almost simultaneously at around 6:10 Sunday morning (local time).
</P>
<P>
The incident took place when a truck loaded with explosives
forced its way through a police barricade in the center of the
town.
</P>
<P>
Police and troops guarding the barricade fired at the truck
before it exploded.
</P>
<P>
The Queen' Hotel, the famous Tooth Relic Temple and many other
surrounding buildings sustained damages due to the impact.
</P>
<P>
Those injured have been rushed to hospitals. Some of them are
in critical conditions.
</P>
<P>
Troops and police personnel had rushed to the scene and
intensified security there.
</P>
<P>
Police have required the public to refrain from visiting the
scene of blast.
</P>
<P>
This was the first major LTTE attack against the Golden Jubilee
celebrations of Sri Lanka's independence from Britain 50 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
Kandy, an inland mountain city, lies 115 km east of Colombo.
The major function of the 50th independence day anniversary is
scheduled to be held there next month, where Sri Lankan President
Chandrika Kumaratunga, Britain's Prince Charles and many other
foreign VIPs will be present.
</P>
<P>
To ensure safety of the VIPs and prevent any sabotage against
the celebrations, the government had already deployed more than
10,000 security forces in the small town of about 100,000 people.
</P>
<P>
The military and police were almost sure the LTTE would seek
every chance to stage attacks during the celebrations, the sources
said.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Reduce Waste Through Recycling Methods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The Pollution Control
Department of Thailand plans to reduce community waste through
recycling by 10 percent in the year 2002.
</P>
<P>
Nisakorn Kositrat, chief of the department's Solid Waste and
Hazardous Substance Management Division was quoted Sunday by local
press as saying that recycling would be an effective way to get
rid of waste in the near future when the cost of waste disposal
would soar due to various factors such as landfill site shortages.
</P>
<P>
"Urban communities nationwide are expected to generate more
than 26,000 tons of waste daily between 1998-2002, and 10 percent
of that total is targeted for recycling," she said.
</P>
<P>
The target is to be increase by 5 percent every five years to
25 percent at the end of 2017, according to a draft recycle master
plan, the department has commissioned a consultant firm to
prepare.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's urbanites generated 19,443 tons of waste in 1996,
888 tons of which were recycled including paper, glass, aluminum,
iron and plastic.
</P>
<P>
Recovery facilities including a recovery plant will be acquired
when the master plan receives approval from policy makers,
Nisakorn said.
</P>
<P>
The recovery plant will serve as a center for waste separation
and distribution of recycled raw materials to industrial plants.

<P>
GUANGZHOU, January 25 (Xinhua) -- With social progress and
change in living standards, Guangzhou people in south China are
found to take to new items of entertainment.
</P>
<P>
In the past, Guangzhou residents, known as "great food lovers",
spent much of their time in restaurants. With a full belly, they
like to play mahjong until midnight.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, karaoke has been a favorite, not only for the
urbanites, but also for the rural folks in the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
More recently, an increasing number of residents of the capital
city of Guangdong Province are found to list body fitness, travel
and going to concerts as their top choices.
</P>
<P>
To fight "modern fatigue" caused by a fast pace of life,
Guangzhou launched a fitness campaign two years ago, calling for
all residents to actively participate in physical training of one
kind or another.
</P>
<P>
The positive response made all local gyms and stadiums open to
the public.
</P>
<P>
"Every week-end the center will be full. You have to make
reservations if you choose the hot items, such as pingpong and
badminton playing," an official of the Tianhe Sports Center said.
</P>
<P>
Guangzhou residents also lead the stream of the country's
travelers. A survey shows that about one third of them make a trip
outside the city every year, and one fifth of them choose overseas
destinations.
</P>
<P>
More and more Guangzhou people are also found to enjoy music,
especially classical music. A ticket for the concert for the New
Year of 1998 cost 200 to 300 yuan (24.09 to 36.14 US dollars)
yuan.

GUANGZHOU, January 25 (Xinhua) -- China's Railway Ministry has
sent 20 additional trains to Guangzhou, the capital of Guangdong
Province, to help move nearly 200,000 people who are stranded
there because of heavy snows on the Beijing-Guangzhou railway line.
</P>
<P>
Only three days are left before Spring Festival, China's most
important holiday and a time for family reunions, meaning many
people on the move.
</P>
<P>
A Yangcheng Railway Corporation official says that, because of
heavy snowfalls on the Hunan part of the railway, train speeds
dropped from over 100 kmph to 20 kmph over the past few days. The
bad weather in Guangdong and Hunan had in fact caused many people
to change their plans to travel by bus and arrange to go by train.
</P>
<P>
The official says the number of railway passengers in Guangzhou
over the past few days has been up 20 percent from the same period
last year.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Linyang, a leading official of the Guangzhou Railway
Group, says that, as of January 23, they had already added 620
temporary trains for Spring Festival and that all the passengers
stranded at the Guangzhou Railway Station are expected to be able
to leave by the 26th.

<HEADLINE> China to Improve Tax Reform for More Revenues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 25 (Xinhua) -- China will continue to reform
tax policies in 1998 to promote the growth of the country's fiscal
revenue and enhance its role in macroeconomic control.
</P>
<P>
The country expects an 8.1 percent rise in revenues to 449.3
billion yuan for the central government in 1998, and a 12.5
percent increase to 388.6 billion for local governments, today's
China Daily quoted the State Administration of Taxation (SAT) as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The administration has also set its 1998 goal for industrial
and commercial tax revenue at over 832 billion yuan, up 11 percent
over last year.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the levy of consumption and value-added taxes, two
major tax items under China's taxation regime, is expected to grow
9.1 percent to 437 billion yuan this year.
</P>
<P>
Tax policy adjustments in 1998 will mainly focus on modifying
consumption tax rates on some commodities and adding some taxable
items, as well as on value-added and business tax in some
industries, and the amendment of the personal income tax system
and reform of the enterprise income tax.
</P>
<P>
Inheritance tax, real estate tax, land-use tax and urban
construction tax are also planned to be introduced. And new tax
policies will be drafted relating to the restructuring of state
enterprises, and improvements will be made to foreign investment
taxes, import taxes, and taxes on specialized agricultural
sectors.
</P>
<P>
Ample fiscal revenue is vital to further state enterprise
restructuring, alleviating re-employment pressure, maintaining
agricultural production stability, and increasing exports.
</P>
<P>
"We have many favorable factors to help us meet the 1998 tax
target," said SAT deputy director Xiang Huaicheng.
</P>
<P>
Economists predict an eight percent increase for China's GDP in
1998, and this rapid and sound development of the national economy
will ensure steady advances in tax resources.
</P>
<P>
State firms, the country's major taxpayers, are likely to
improve their performance by improving efficiency while downsizing
staff this year, which will provide a sound basis for tax
collection.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Central Bank Governor: Banking Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine banking industry
was strong and healthy compared to its counterparts in Indonesia,
South Korea and Thailand which have been experiencing bank
failures, local press reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The report said Central Bank governor Gabriel Singson made this
assessment in response to a question from Asian Development Bank
President Mitsuo Sato on the state of the country's banking
sector.
</P>
<P>
Sato himself has observed the Philippine banks "to be
relatively better off than other banks in Asia, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It said Singson attributed the healthy state of the industry to
measures taken by the Central Bank such as increasing the minimum
capital of banks, setting aside additional loan-loss reserves and
limiting their exposure to properties to only 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the bank is also drawing guidelines for a proposed
peso-dollar swap arrangement that will provide liquidity to local
banks, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Singson blamed rumors about the supposed shaky
status of some local large banks on foreign banks wishing to
attract deposits of Filipino citizens.
</P>
<P>
Singson said the Central Bank is monitoring daily the
performance of banks in terms of actual resources, earnings and
withdrawals, adding that he gets in touch every day with top
officials of the country's banks, both small and big.
</P>
<P>
He said some banks are experiencing slight growth in their past
due loans, now averaging at 4.5 to 5 percent of the total
portfolio from last year's pre-peso devaluation level of 3
percent.
</P>
<P>
"But this level is by far very manageable and, compared with
other Asian banks, we are definitely far better off," Singson
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 25 (Xinhua) -- China will be able to satisfy
its demand for color cathode-ray tubes with domestic production
and is to boost CRT exports in the new year, today's China Daily
reported.
</P>
<P>
Over the years, China has become one of the world's leading CRT
producers. Production volume for 1997 was expected to hit 21
million, against domestic demand of 22 million, said the official
from the Ministry of Electronics Industry.
</P>
<P>
Since 1996, domestic CRT makers have waged several battles in a
price war which has brought down prices dramatically to below the
international level.
</P>
<P>
Profits were low in 1997 and two CRT firms have been forced to
close down.
</P>
<P>
The price cutting will continue for another one or two years
before prices hit rock-bottom, predicted an expert.
</P>
<P>
CRT production for 1998 is estimated at 30 million compared
with domestic demand of only 27 million.
</P>
<P>
The government will not approve any new CRT projects in
1998. There are ten CRT enterprises in China and another three
under construction.

<HEADLINE> Democrats Urge Clinton to Repond to Sex Allegations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The Democrats, including
U.S. President Bill Clinton's longtime allies, are urging the
president to explain his relationship with former White House
intern Monica Lewinsky quickly.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's former chief of staff, Leon Panetta, told the San
Jose Mercury News in California, "This is not going to go away and
be lost in the judicial system."
</P>
<P>
"You're dealing with a Congress that is likely to move against
him in the Judiciary Committee. And unless he's got a clear
resolution of this matter, Congress itself is going to be
paralyzed," Panetta said.
</P>
<P>
George Stephanopoulos, also a former top White House aide, said
that if the accusations are true, "they're not only politically
damaging, but it could lead to impeachment proceedings."
</P>
<P>
Across the country, the Democrats are reportedly asking Clinton
for answers.
</P>
<P>
"I think the feeling out here is concern," Marc Abrams,
chairman of the Oregon Democratic Party, was quoted by The
Associated Press as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We would like to believe there is no merit in these charges,
and we would like to see the president have a constructive
remaining three years to complete his agenda," Abrams said.
</P>
<P>
Interviews with more than a dozen state party chairmen and vice
chairmen suggest an emerging consensus: Clinton's staunchest
supporters outside Washington tend to believe his denials,
question if the accusations were politically motivated and fear
the American public will not give him the benefit of the doubt
much longer, the AP report said.
</P>
<P>
Many Democrats worry that the alleged affair and an
investigation into whether Clinton tried to cover it up will
overshadow the State of the Union address. Tuesday's speech is a
high-profile kickoff of the Democrats' push to challenge the
Republicans' control of Congress.
</P>
<P>
Democratic National Committee General Chairman Roy Romer said
he believes Clinton's denials but worries about the controversy's
effect on the party.
</P>
<P>
Many Democrats agree that Clinton will ride this storm out.
They just hope he does it soon.

<HEADLINE> 300 Chiapas Prisoners Released in Mexico </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, January 24 (Xinhua) -- Mexican officials Saturday
freed some 300 prisoners in the southern state of Chiapas, in a
move to show the government's determination to support the
reopening of dialogue with Zapatista rebels.
</P>
<P>
The release came during a government campaign to smooth over
its relations with the Zapatistas, who won strong support in the
southern region.
</P>
<P>
Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo on Friday reiterated the
government's commitment to the San Andres peace accords, which
promise greater autonomy for Mexico's indigenous population.
</P>
<P>
Peace negotiations with the rebels broke down in September
1996, when the rebels accused the government of reneging on its
promises.

<HEADLINE> EU Files Complaint with WTO over Canadian Film Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) has
recently filed a complaint at the World Trade Organization (WTO)
over Canada's policy on film distribution, it was learned here
today.
</P>
<P>
Dutch entertainment group Polygram NV has said that Canada's
policy discriminates against European producers while allowing
rivals from the United States to freely distribute films in
Canada, according to European Report, a twice-weekly newsletter
published in Brussels Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The EU argues that a refusal by Ottawa is breaking WTO rules by
refusing to allow Polygram to distribute foreign films.
</P>
<P>
The bar reportedly results from a 1987 law which says that film
distribution can only be undertaken by companies responsible for
more than half of the production costs of the film in question.
If not, they have to pay Canadian distributors to do the job.
</P>
<P>
The law was aimed at the major Hollywood studios which account
for 84 percent of the Canadian market, but it failed to control
them.
</P>
<P>
The Hollywood studios simply side-stepped the law by becoming
established as Canadian companies.
</P>
<P>
Polygram, 75 percent of which is owned by Dutch electronics group
Philips, says it is the only company affected by the law.
</P>
<P>
The group, responsible for the box office hit Four Weddings and
A Funeral, says that it might expect to lose some one million
Canadian dollars (some 720,000 U.S. dollars) over the next five
years because of the law.
