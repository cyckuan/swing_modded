<HEADLINE> Lusaka Talks on Congo (K) Put Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 25 (Xinhua) -- The planned Lusaka summit on
Congo crisis has been rescheduled to ensure maximum participation
as some parties are likely to be absent because of the Christmas
holidays, a Zimbabwean government spokesman said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Lusaka talks on the issue of the Democratic Republic of Congo
(DRC) which were set for December 28 have been postponed to early
next year, said presidential spokesman George Charamba.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwe News Agency reported that the talks, led by
Zambian President Frederick Chiluba, were put off till an
unspecified date early next year.
</P>
<P>
A Zambian government spokesman said in Lusaka Friday that the
regional summit on the conflict in the Great Lakes region has
been postponed to next January, without giving the exact date.
</P>
<P>
A peaceful solution to the conflict has eluded Congo (K) many
times after the war to topple Congolese President Laurent Kabila
broke out on August 2 this year.
</P>
<P>
The sources quoted by Friday's Herald daily newspaper said
that Southern African Development Community (SADC) leaders could
not agree on whether the rebels should be brought at the same
meeting with Kabila.
</P>
<P>
The source noted that South African President Nelson Mandela
wanted the rebels in Congo (K) to directly participate in the
talks, a position which has been rejected by other leaders. The
source said that it was one of the reasons why the Lusaka meeting
was rescheduled.
</P>
<P>
Kabila has insisted on not negotiating directly with the
rebels.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Zambian President Chiluba, who was supposed to host
the summit, sent his special envoy Eric Silwamba with a message
to Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Silwamba told reporters after his brief meeting with Mugabe
that there was growing confidence that a cease-fire agreement for
the war-torn Congo (K) would be signed soon.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia have deployed troops, air planes
and ammunition to fight with Kabila's troops against the rebels.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Election Govt Formed in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Prime Minister Girija
Prasad Koirala Friday formed an 11-member cabinet designed for
conducting "free, fair and impartial elections" by March/April
1999.
</P>
<P>
The slim cabinet includes the prime minister and 10 ministers,
but it is expected to be expanded later for the inclusion of other
parties wishful to enter in the spirit of an all-party government
for the elections.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement reached between the Nepali Congress (NC)
and the Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxism-Leninism,
CPN-UML), the two major ruling partners, the government shall work
out a detailed plan to ensure the strict adherence by the
government and all political parties to the code of conduct
formulated by the Election Commission to make the elections free,
fair and peaceful.
</P>
<P>
The agreement also called for impartial mobilization of such
sensitive bodies as police, administration and information and
communications for the elections.
</P>
<P>
The CPN-UML was the strongest advocate of a national government
comprising all parties in parliament for fresh polls when a new
round of political turmoil erupted on December 10 with the
Communist Party of Nepal (Marxism-Leninism, CPN-ML) breaking its
three-and-half-a-month alliance with NC.
</P>
<P>
The CPN-ML alleged that the NC had failed to abide by the
agreements reached with it and other left parties in August.
</P>
<P>
On December 11, NC President and Prime Minister Girija Prasad
Koirala recommended to the Royal Palace for dissolution of
parliament for fresh elections on March 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The party also held that given the political situation in the
country, there was no other alternative to holding free, fair and
impartial elections for a fresh popular mandate.
</P>
<P>
The National Democratic Party (RPP) led by former prime
minister Surya Bahadur Thapa echoed, but demanded as well a
substitute government for free and fair elections.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, the NC and the CPN-UML, the two powers in
parliament, agreed on the formation of an all-party government
under Koirala's continued premiership for conducting the
elections.
</P>
<P>
As the CPN-ML, the RPP and other parties registered the same
day a no-confidence motion against the NC minority government,
Koirala resigned Monday under the agreement to pave the way for a
new coalition.
</P>
<P>
He was reappointed as prime minister Wednesday by King Birendra
as he won a majority support in the Lower House of Parliament
backed by the NC, the CPN-UML and the Nepal Sadbhavana Party.
</P>
<P>
The tri-partite government is the sixth in the country since
the mid-term polls in November 1994 which produced a hung
parliament with no single party holding a majority.

HARARE, December 25 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government
encourages young people to abstain from sex until after marriage
as it is one way to reduce HIV infections in the country, a
cabinet minister said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Lands and Agriculture Minister Kumbirai Kangai said the
HIV/AIDS pandemic had adversely affected the most productive age
group in the country, raising concern over the number of talented
lives being lost.
</P>
<P>
The minister was speaking as a guest of honor at the wedding
of a local journalist Kelvin Jakachira in Mutare of east
Zimbabwe, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Kangai said the ruling ZANU (PF) had put in place programs to
encourage abstinence until after marriage in an effort to arrest
the spreading of HIV infection and other sexually-transmitted
diseases.
</P>
<P>
He said the programs supported the government's efforts to
curb the spreading of the virus through such organizations as the
national AIDS coordination program.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe is only second to Botswana on the world list of
countries worst affected by AIDS.
</P>
<P>
About 1.4 million adult Zimbabweans, 25.8 percent of sexually
active adults between 15 and 49 years are thought to be infected
with HIV. More than 700 people die every week from
HIV/AIDS-related illnesses.

<HEADLINE> UK's Queen Praises Ties that Bind Generations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Queen Elizabeth made one of her
most personal broadcasts to the nation and the Commonwealth on
Friday that sought to give the British monarchy a more caring
image.
</P>
<P>
"It is not always easy for those in their teens or twenties to
believe that someone of my age, of the older generation might have
something useful to say to them," the 72-year-old monarch told
television viewers in 50 Commonwealth countries around the world.
</P>
<P>
In her annual Christmas message, she reflected on what
different generations can learn from one another, and the
charitable spirit that binds the country together.
</P>
<P>
She also paid tribute to the British soldiers who took part in
last week's air strikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Queen's theme was the ties that bind the generations
together.
</P>
<P>
Her Majesty said that we should never underestimate what older
people, such as her 98-year-old mother, have lived through.
</P>
<P>
"I would say that my mother has much to say to me. Indeed, her
vigour and enjoyment of life is a great example of how to close
the so-called generation gap."
</P>
<P>
She related the sacrifices of the older generation to those
made by British forces involved in the recent air strikes on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
She said: "They remember struggles unknown to young people
today, and which they will not forget. Nor should their countries
forget them.
</P>
<P>
But there is still much that can be learned from the young -
including her own grandchildren - with their grasp of science,
discovery and foreign cultures, the Queen said.
</P>
<P>
However, she added: "The older I get, the more conscious I
become of the difficulties young people have to face as they learn
to live in the modern world.
</P>
<P>
"We parents and grandparents must learn to trust our children
and grandchildren as they seize their opportunities, but we can,
at the same time, caution and comfort if things go wrong, or guide
and explain if we are needed," the Queen added.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Opposition Groups to Set Up Army </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi opposition groups are
to form an army in southern Iraq to topple the government of
President Saddam Hussein, the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA)
Friday quoted an Iraqi opposition radio as saying.
</P>
<P>
The radio owned by the Iraqi Kurdistan's Islamic Rabeteh
Party, which was monitored in western Iran, reported that 16
Iraqi opposition groups agreed to set up a united armed forces in
their recent meeting in London, attended by a U.S. State Department
senior official.
</P>
<P>
Without giving more details, the report said that
representatives of the Iraqi Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) and
Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), the two biggest groups in the
Iraqi Kurdistan, were present at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Following the recent U.S.-British air and missile strikes
against Iraq, Washington has stepped up its efforts to cooperate
with Iraqi opposition groups in order to topple Saddam's
government.
</P>
<P>
However, the Iran-based Supreme Council of the Islamic
Revolution in Iraq (SCIR) stated on Wednesday that it had
never announced readiness to cooperate with the U.S. and Britain
for the Saddam's ouster.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to Qatar television reporter in Tehran, the SCIR
chairman Mohammad Baqer Hakim said that every political change
in Iraq should be instituted by the Iraqi people.

signed last October on further Israeli withdrawal from the West
Bank if the Palestinians do not meet its demands, including the
cancellation of a plan to declare a Palestinian state next May.

The talks are expected to cover the latest U.S.-British
military strikes against Iraq and Yemen's call for an urgent Arab
summit in this regard, said the ambassador.

<HEADLINE> Pak Wants Best Ties With India on Equality Basis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's President Rafiq
Tarar said Saturday that his country is willing to have the best
bilateral and friendly ties with neighboring India on the basis of
equality.
</P>
<P>
Talking to the outgoing Indian High Commissioner Satish Chandra
at the President House, Tarar said, "India should also respond to
the goodwill gesture of Pakistan while accepting the ground
realities."
</P>
<P>
Explaining the ground realities, the president said India must
demonstrate sincerity regarding the resumed process of talks
between the two sides at the foreign-secretary level to address
the outstanding issues with the top issue being Jammu and Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
"The root cause of hostile atmosphere in the subcontinent is
the dispute of Jammu and Kashmir and other outstanding issues
prevailing since 1947," an official source quoted the president as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Tarar noted that the government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif,
during its previous and present tenures, took the initiative to
cool down the temperature between India and Pakistan,
demonstrating willingness to address and identify all the
outstanding issues including Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
He, however, charged that India did not demonstrate its
willingness on the subject.
</P>
<P>
Tarar said resolution of the Kashmir issue is not only key to
stability and prosperity in the region but would also result in
the best bilateral and friendly relations between India and
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The president hailed the efforts by the departing Indian envoy
and hoped that the coming round of the foreign-secretary level
talks scheduled to be held in New Delhi in February next year
would be encouraging and result-oriented.
</P>
<P>
He also called on the world community to play its due role in
settling the issues of Jammu and Kashmir between the two South
Asian nations.
</P>
<P>
The world community must realize that Pakistan and India are
nuclear powers and tension-free relations between the two
countries could also ensure world peace and stability, he said.

<HEADLINE> Miracle Elephant Close to Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Round the clock treatment
has been given to a 24-year old elephant in Henan suffering from
acute pancreatitis for the last seven days, but it is reported
that Luweng is now in a critical condition.
</P>
<P>
The female elephant has been lying on the ground since last
Saturday but has already amazed veterinary surgeons, who have been
camped in the elephant compound since the crisis occurred, when
she stood up unaided for more than three hours after almost 80
hours flat-out.
</P>
<P>
The Zhengzhou Zoo in the capital of central China's Henan
Province has already spent 100,000 yuan (about 12,000 US dollars)
in its attempts to save the elephant, which was introduced from
Wuhan Zoo in central China's Hubei Province in 1987.
</P>
<P>
"If she was in the wild, Luweng would die within a few hours
because her heart and lungs would be crushed by her own weight,"
explained one of the vets. "But it is also another miracle that she
has survived so many days, with a pancreas in such a poor state,
as well as problems with other internal organs.
</P>
<P>
According to the vet, tears ran down Luweng's face as her male
friend Babu tried to force his way into the "sickroom" from an
adjoining compound to comfort her.
</P>
<P>
"Many local residents visted the zoo with fruit to see Luweng
and some of them even suggested ways to treat her," said Chen
Xingwang, the zoo keeper.
</P>
<P>
"We are willing to spend more money to prolong her life," said
Chen, "but people are already beginning to consider the idea of
having her stuffed after her death and put her on display."

<HEADLINE> Nobel Laureate Calls China Example of Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 26 (Xinhua) -- China is a good example of
how the market could be utilized as a tool for economic
development in a state-controlled economy, Nobel laureate Amartya
Sen said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"China has played the market game with extraordinary skill,"
Sen said at a meet-the-press program at the Press Club in
Calcutta, 1,460 kilometers southeast of here.
</P>
<P>
"They (the Chinese) have shown it is possible for us to make
good use of the market. We have to learn from its achievements,"
said Sen, who returned to his hometown last week after receiving
the Nobel Prize in Economics for the year 1998.
</P>
<P>
However, Sen said, while the market has a contribution in
shaping the world's economic history, it is wrong to depend solely
on market forces for a country's development.
</P>
<P>
Calling for "adequate" government leadership for proper
utilization of the market, the welfare economist said its success
depends on factors like land reforms, education, health care and
protection of backward industries.
</P>
<P>
Non-governmental organizations and the media also have a role
to play in ensuring "proper" utilization of the market, he said.
</P>
<P>
Sen said it is very difficult to point out which country in the
world has the best economic policy in terms of human goals.
</P>
<P>
Successful economies in Europe have the problem of growing
unemployment to cope with and the United States has the problems
of inequality in health care, the renowned economist said, adding
that every economy has something to be criticized and learn from.

<P>
Yang Xiongli, an academician at the Chinese Academy of
Sciences (CAS), expressed regret over the wrong use and
translation of specific terms in the book.
</P>
<P>
"The actual concept misleads readers," said Yang, who is an
expert in encephalic science. "To expect all people to learn in
the same way is even more misleading. Even the best learning
method won't suit everyone."
</P>
<P>
However, he accepted that to some extent "The Learning
Revolution" provides much information and agrees with the authors
that people must continually learn to keep up with the rapidly
developing world of information.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile Chen Baoping, editor-in-chief of the book's
publishers, Shenghuo-Dushu-Xinzhi Joint Publishing Company (JPC)
of Shanghai said: "We believe it adheres to China's policy of
revitalizing the country through science, technology and
education, and to promoting quality-oriented education in
schools."

Although some who have read the book say there are a number of
good ideas, others declare that it is not suited to traditional
Chinese teaching methods.
</P>
<P>
Yuan Zhenguo, dean of the education department of
Shanghai-based East China Teachers' University, said that it was
not written logically and could not stand close scrutiny. "It
should not be used as a guide book to learning," he insisted.
</P>
<P>
However, the CSC vice-president, Sun Bin, said: "Foreign
authors write differently; they offer the pros and cons through
examples, which is different from the way Chinese authors explain
subjects."
</P>
<P>
Already five million copies have been printed and Sun Bin
agreed that it may seem a lot. "But we intend to create a market
for this book," he said, adding that he confidently expected to
have sold 1.4 million copies by this weekend, since it was first
put on sale.

<HEADLINE> Year-ender: Jordan Makes All-out Effort to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Jordan has been making an all-out
effort in 1998 to enliven its economy which remained sluggish in
the past years.
</P>
<P>
Want of vitality has been nagging the economy of the kingdom,
which is short of natural resources, especially oil deposit, in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
The GDP (gross domestic products) growth rate, which was 0.8
percent in 1996, slumped to a negative figure in 1997, according
to media reports.
</P>
<P>
An economists-oriented government headed by Prime Minister
Fayez Tarawneh, a U.S.-educated economist, was formed in August.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after sworn in, the cabinet started talks with the
World Bank (WB) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to
extend their 1989-1999 reform plan for the kingdom for at least
one year.
</P>
<P>
Due to the WB-IMF plan, Jordan has succeeded in stabilizing the
currency rate of the Jordanian dinar and expanding foreign
currency reserves. But it failed to realize healthy GDP growth
rates as expected.
</P>
<P>
The government stepped up privatization process in 1998 in a
bid to add new impetus to the economic activities.
</P>
<P>
It decided in October to sell 49 percent of the shares of the
monopoly Jordan Telecommunication Company to foreign and domestic
investors. The decision was aimed at drawing private investment
and updating the technology and management of the company.
</P>
<P>
Amman invited Western legal and financial advisors in September
to make preparations for the privatization of the national Royal
Jordanian airline.
</P>
<P>
Similar measures were also taken in 1998 to privatize the
Jordan Cement Factories Company, the largest cement producer in
the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
After industry comes trade.
</P>
<P>
Jordan carried on the strong trade ties through 1998 with Iraq,
one of its largest trade partners since the 1991 Gulf War. It
exported 305.3 million U.S. dollars worth of goods to Iraq in 1997
and the first half of 1998.
</P>
<P>
But its export to other Arab counties, its traditional markets,
stood only at 353 million dollars in the first seven months of
1998, a 22 percent decrease from the same period of 1997.
</P>
<P>
With the attraction to its traditional markets waning, Jordan
drummed up efforts in 1998 to develop new trade partners.
</P>
<P>
Its exports to eastern Europe and Africa jumped by 255 percent
in the first half of this year over the same period of 1997.
</P>
<P>
It signed a partnership agreement with the European Union last
year and has been negotiating a trade deal with the European Free
Trade Association this year.
</P>
<P>
The government held rounds of talks this year with Israel and
the Palestinians aimed at breaking Israeli monopoly over the
Palestinian market and facilitating the flow of Jordanian goods
into the area.
</P>
<P>
With the negotiations with the World Trade Organization (WTO)
going on this year, the kingdom holds a high hope of entering the
global trade institution in mid-1999.
</P>
<P>
To encourage import, the government secured 34 million dollars
of credit facilities from the Arab Monetary Fund (AMF) for its
domestic importers.
</P>
<P>
The kingdom tightened restrictions in 1998 on the inflow of
foreign labors to spare more employment opportunities for its own
citizens.
</P>
<P>
The government ordered in September that illegal foreign
workers, who estimatedly make up most of the guest workers
presently in the kingdom, rectify their status and those who
failed to do so would be deported.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian government established a special company also in
September to help qualified Jordanians find oversea jobs in order
to get more foreign currency remitted back home.
</P>
<P>
Jordan hopes to shake off economic difficulties and realize a 6
percent GDP growth rate in the year 2000 through wiser policy-
making, industrial renovation, trade extension, development of
human resources as well as foreign financial support.
</P>
<P>
However, with unemployment rate hovering at 27 percent this
year, and in a region haunted by political instability, local
analysts cautioned that more has to be done before the country
could meet its expectations.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Builds Farm for Mental Patients </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 26 (Xinhua) -- The first phase of a unique
combined medical and farming experiment was launched today to help
rehabilitate many Beijing mental patients.
</P>
<P>
Jin Dacheng, vice-head of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of
Health, explained that there are over 10,000 mental patients in
Beijing, while there are only 6,000 beds for them.
</P>
<P>
It means that lots of patients cannot get sufficient medical
treatment, creating problems for the patients' families as well as
the society.
</P>
<P>
The farm project combines medical and recovery treatment which
encourages patients to help raise fish, geese, chickens, ducks and
goats. According to doctors, getting involved in some farming
activities will not only ease the side effect of medicines, but
also shorten the patients' recovery period.,
</P>
<P>
It allows the society in general to assist the hospital with
the treatment of such patients.
</P>
<P>
Huang Zheng, who is in charge of the farm, announced that the
first phase of the project was complete with a total investment of
2.48 million yuan (300,000 U.S. dollars). And the remaining two
phases are expected to be finished by the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
The farm is now able to receive 120 patients, and will be
able to accommodate 260 patients when fully operational.
</P>
<P>
The monthly expenditure per patient is just 600 to 900 yuan,
which is comparatively low compared with the usual hospital
expenses of 2,000 to 3,000 yuan.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Trade Deficit Accounts for 21 PC of Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam has a trade deficit of
about 2.03 billion U.S. dollars in 1998, accounting for 21 percent
of its export turnover, Vietnam News Agency (VNA) reported
Saturday, quoting the General Department of Statistics.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's export turnover in 1998 has already reached 9.35

<HEADLINE> Year-ender: European Integration Speeds Up in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 26 (Xinhua) -- The year of 1998 has seen the
European Union (EU)'s great efforts to deepen its internal
integration and start its eastward expansion, which demonstrates
the EU's ambition to become a major power in the multi-polar world.
</P>
<P>
The launch of the euro and the eastward enlargement, the EU's
two trans-century tasks, had been written into the 15-nation bloc's
future strategy titled "Agenda 2000" in July, 1997, and achieved
concrete progress this year.
</P>
<P>
In early May, the Council of the European Union, the EU's
policy-making body, set January 1, 1999 as the launching date of
the euro, and announced the list of 11 qualified countries for
membership in the future euro zone.
</P>
<P>
On June 1, the European Central Bank was formally established
to carry out a single monetary policy for the euro zone.
</P>
<P>
On December 3, the euro zone central banks took a coordinated
action to cut interest rates to a level of three percent to
guarantee the smooth launch of the euro. Additionally, the
countries concerned has begun to produce the paper form and coins
of the euro.
</P>
<P>
Currently, with the euro's arrival, the EU could compare in
everything to the United States. The EU said its new currency zone
will cover some 300 million Europeans and will account for 19.4
percent of the world's GDP, compared with 19.6 percent for the
United States
</P>
<P>
The euro will confirm the EU's importance as a commercial power
in the world with an 18.2 percent share of world trade, equal to
that of the United States. Exports from the euro zone have already
been 25 percent higher than those of the United States and twice
those of Japan. The euro is expected to play a growing role in
international trade in the future.
</P>
<P>
The EU also believes that Europe's new currency might soon
change the situation now in which the U.S. dollar plays a dominant
role in the world economy.
</P>
<P>
It is not expected to be a rival to the U.S. dollar, the EU
said, but will complement it, allowing for diversification and
reducing the risk of countries being faced with abnormal currency
fluctuations.
</P>
<P>
The EU commissioner for economic, monetary and financial
affairs, Yves-Thibault de Silguy, has said the single currency is
the crowning achievement of a 40-year process of European
integration. The first benefits will be more economic growth,
more investment, more competitive companies and more jobs for
European citizens.
</P>
<P>
Actually, the long-term strategic goal of European integration
is to realize political union in order to become a very
influential force in the world arena. Therefore, the euro will be
an impetus for the EU to accelerate the process of a politically
unified Europe.
</P>
<P>
The EU's expansion to the central and eastern European
countries is another strategic move which will enable the Western
European bloc to turn into a real European nations' union.
</P>
<P>
Early Last month, the European Commission made the first of its
Regular Reports assessing the progress of the 12 candidate
countries towards EU membership.
</P>
<P>
On November 10, the EU held ministerial meetings for the first
time with Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovenia, Estonia
and Cyprus, the six qualified candidate countries for EU
membership, which means the pre-accession negotiations entered
into a substantive stage.
</P>
<P>
But it is hard for the central and eastern European countries
to enter the EU in the near future because of difficulties in
transforming old institutions and structures.
</P>
<P>
For the next enlargement, the EU has given a general picture of
particulars compared with previous enlargements: first, the
development of EU integration requires a higher level of stability
and competitiveness for new members; second, the starting point of
the countries now preparing for membership is very different from
those of previous applicants because of wide differences and huge
economic gaps; third, to keep a future union of over 20 members
operational, it is a must for the EU to reform within the existing
institution.
</P>
<P>
Some experts and analysts here predicted that the earliest date
for EU to adopt the first batch of applying countries will not
come before the year of 2003.
</P>
<P>
Although the euro is expected to spur a higher level of the
integration and the enlargement and enhance the union's muscles,
many problems are still waiting to be solved.
</P>
<P>
The heads of EU members in their recently concluded Vienna
Summit have set the employment strategy as a priority and agreed
to make efforts to lower the unemployment, the social time-bomb,
among other issues.
</P>
<P>
Whether or not the European Union in the future will create a
unified, authoritative voice in international affairs, relies on
its member states give up, in part, their own interests for the
mutual benefit of others, since they are already willing to give
up part of their own monetary sovereignty for a single currency
with a single representative voice.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 26 (Xinhua) -- A century after discovering
radium, which is used in cancer treatment, Nobel Prize winner
Marie Curie is still deeply respected in China for her devotion to
science and to people.
</P>
<P>
More than 600 key Chinese scientists and others involved in
related research attended a commemorative meeting in Beijing today
to mark the discovery of radium by Marie and her husband Pierre
Curie.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Science and Technology Zhu Lilan urged young
Chinese scientists to commit themselves to similar scientific
exploration and to emulate Mrs Curie's courage and patriotism, to
assist the development of their motherland.
</P>
<P>
A recent poll among Chinese women showed that Marie Curie
ranked first among the world's top ten most-respected women.
</P>
<P>
The life story of the Polish-born scientist has been part of
the curriculum for middle school students in China for decades.
</P>
<P>
For her contribution to research into radioactivity, Marie
Curie was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1903 and the
prize for chemistry in 1911, becoming the first female Nobel Prize
winner and the first scientist to win two Nobel prizes.
</P>
<P>
Scientists attending the meeting loudly praised Marie Curie's
personal strength as she never sought fame or wealth, and gave
herself totally to charity works and helped the poor.
</P>
<P>
"Young students should learn from her strong sense of social
responsibility and noble character," said Zhou Guangzhao, chairman
of the China Association for Science and Technology.

<HEADLINE> Controversial "Learning Revolution" Book Under Fire (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Controversy is raging in
Chinese academic circles and book-shops over the latest edition of
a foreign written book about methods of learning which publishers
hope will sell 10 million copies.
</P>
<P>
As much as 100 million yuan has been earmarked for sales
promotion of the book, "The Learning Revolution", throughout
China, the largest sum ever on a book promotion, but leading
Chinese booksellers are sceptical while top academics are critical
of its style and content.
</P>
<P>
Written by Jeannette Vos from the United States and Gorden
Dryden from New Zealand, the book sold 250,000 copies of its first
edition in China, considered to be a healthy figure, but has come
in for a storm of criticism since its revised edition was launched
on December 12.
</P>
<P>
The two authors put forward bold ideas to reform ways of
learning; believing that how is much more important than what to
learn. They say learning should be interesting and show how it can
be done efficiently.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese company promoting the book said that it believed it
was good and could benefit many people. The Clever Software
(Group) Co. (CSC), the largest education software producer in
China, agreed to spend 100 million yuan (about 12 million
U.S. dollars) to promote "The Learning Revolution".
</P>
<P>
However, Chen Mulin, the manager in charge of book distribution
of the Xinhua Bookstore in Shanghai, the biggest book-chain in
China, said: "We are shocked and dumbstruck by CSC's ambition and
resolution." And he questioned the validity of CSC's target of
selling 10 million copies.

<HEADLINE> Local Governments Blamed for Grave Soil Erosion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Senior Chinese law-maker Buhe
blamed "some local governments and departments" for the country's
still grave situation of soil erosion here today.
</P>
<P>
They are "lax in enforcing the law on water and soil
conservation," and some have been found to deliberately violated
the law for local and departmental interests, he said at the
ongoing meeting of the National People's Congress (NPC) Standing
Committee.
</P>
<P>
Buhe, vice-chairman of the NPC Standing Committee was detailing a
recent environmental survey by the legislature of the middle and
upper reachers of Yangtze and Yellow rivers in October and
November after the ravaged flooding this summer in China.
</P>
<P>
"Soil erosion caused by people is very serious," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the senior law-maker, since the law on water and
soil conservation was enacted seven years ago, erosion control
projects nationwide have benefited 256,000 square kilometers of
areas and money still keeps pouring into the effort.
</P>
<P>
Statistics also show that the central government allocated 2.1
billion yuan for those projects, maintaining forests and planting
trees.
</P>
<P>
"However," Buhe said, "as our projects cover another 35,000
square kilometers annually, another 10,000 square kilometers of
areas are being eroded."
</P>
<P>
"The total area with serious soil erosion in China amounts to
3.67 million square kilometers, or 38.2 percent of the national
land mass, and with the current rate of recovery, we have to spend
60 to 70 years to make these areas free of soil erosion," Buhe
said.
</P>
<P>
"The upper and middle reaches of the Yangtze and Yellow rivers
are the most important, yet the most difficult places in terms of
water and soil conservation, as well as grasslands encroached by
deserts," he said.
</P>
<P>
He cited several bad examples of violations of environmental
laws. For instance, Shanxi Province have been found to have dump
mines waste to river beds, which poses a major threat to the lives
of people if flooding occurs.
</P>
<P>
He urged a more comprehensive legal framework for the
conservation of water and soil to be set up and local government
officials and departments must know that without sound
environment, economic progress will be like a mansion built on
sand.
</P>
<P>
He said that legislatures at various levels should strengthen
their role in law enforcement supervision and the judiciary must
have those who break the law punished.

<P>
NEW DELHI, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Eleven coal miners were
killed and six others injured Friday night when a speeding goods
train plowed into their bus at a manned level-crossing in the
eastern Bihar State.
</P>
<P>
The Press Trust of India (PTI) said the bus carrying the miners
to their night shift tried to pass through the crossing after its
driver took away the keys by force from the gatekeeper who had
already closed the gates for the train to pass.
</P>
<P>
After ramming into the bus, the train dragged it for about a
kilometer on the track, PTI said.
</P>
<P>
The local railway manager said 11 people including the driver
were killed while unofficial reports put the death toll at 40.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, seven people were killed and another seven injured
Saturday in a head-on collision between a jeep and a truck due to
dense fog in Uttar Pradesh, North India.
</P>
<P>
In the same state, four people of the Border Road Organization
were killed when a vehicle carrying them fell into a roadside
ditch Friday.

<HEADLINE> W. African States Plan to Meet on S. Leone's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 26 (Xinhua) -- West African states will meet
in Cote d'Ivoire Monday to discuss the escalating war in Sierra
Leone, a report reaching here Saturday said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, hosted by Cote d'Ivoire, would group foreign
ministers from a special committee set up by the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS) to end the conflicts in
the former British colony, an Ivorian official was quoted as
saying Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The rebels, who took up arms in 1991 and supported the 1997
coup that temporarily ousted President Ahmed T. Kabbah, attacked
villages on the approaches to Sierra Leone's capital Freetown
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
They attacked the northern city of Makeni Wednesday, and
declared that they would march on to the capital.
</P>
<P>
The situation in the west African country in the past few days
became worse as fighting occurred in areas around the capital.
</P>
<P>
A Nigerian-led ECOWAS intervention force restored Kabbah to
power in March after ejecting a military junta from the capital.
The rebels retreated to the east where fierce fighting broke out
near the border of Liberia in the past.

<HEADLINE> China to Revise Marriage Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 26 (Xinhua) -- The Ninth National People's
Congress (NPC) of China will in its five-year term revise the
country's Marriage Law and formulate several other major laws,
such as laws on administrative permits, fee collection by the
government, according to the ongoing meeting of the NPC Standing
Committee.
</P>
<P>
The NPC Law Committee, Civil and Judicial Committee and three
other special committees of the top legislature disclosed the plan
today when reporting their handling of bills submitted by NPC
deputies earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
The legislature was told that an special leading group on
revising the marriage law has been set up during the 8th NPC. A
draft revision has been made and is still under discussions and
further revisions by related departments.
</P>
<P>
This law is expected to be included in a legislative plan of
the 9th NPC, a law-maker said.
</P>
<P>
Some 90 NPC deputies have proposed that a unified law
governing administrative procedures be formulated.
</P>
<P>
The NPC Law Committee said that such a legislation has always
been the NPC's top priority because it is crucial to the building
of an honest and clean government, but it is also very difficult,
and they suggest to formulate separate laws in this regard in the
first place.
</P>
<P>
The law on administrative punishment has been passed in 1996,
and the law on administrative appeals is under discussion, and
three other laws, on administrative permit, fee collection and
compulsory measures are also expected to be formulated in five
years, the Law Committee said.
</P>
<P>
The top legislature is also planning to make laws governing the
reform of government restructuring. Other planned laws include
those on civil service, population and family planning and
protecting the rights and interests of farmers.

<HEADLINE> Evidence to Nanjing Massacre Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Vital evidence which helps
confirm the Nanjing Massacre has been discovered by a historian
in Tianjin who says that it supports the claims of a Japanese
eye-witness whose diary of the events was dismissed by a court in
Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
Chen Jikui, former Dean of the History Department of Tianjin
Normal University, revealed yesterday that he has a map which
indicates the existence of three puddles in front of the Nanjing
Higher Court at the time of the 1937 atrocities.
</P>
<P>
Shiro Azuma, a former Japanese soldier, wrote in his war-time
diary that Japanese soldiers poured petrol on and tied hand
grenades to Chinese prisoners who were put into sacks and then
thrown into the puddles in front of the Nanjing court.
</P>
<P>
After publishing his diary in 1996, Shiro Azuma was promptly
sued by a man listed in it as a war criminal. The Tokyo Court
denied the existence of the puddles and therefore ruled against
the accuracy of Shiro Azuma's account.
</P>
<P>
However, Chen's find, which includes a detailed map of
Nanjing published in September 1935, illustrates there were indeed
three puddles in front of the court, covering 2,200, 1,500 and 800
square meters respectively.
</P>
<P>
Chen has now asked that relevant Chinese government departments
advise Shiro Azuma of the find which includes several hand-drawn
maps of Tianjin when it was under the yoke of Japanese military
aggression.
</P>
<P>
A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman expressed surprise and
regret over the verdict issued by the Tokyo Court of Japan in the
case of the diary of Shiro Azuma.

<HEADLINE> Water Quality Improves in Taihu Lake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Water quality in Taihu Lake of
east China's Jiangsu Province has improved compared with last
year, announced a monitoring network of the water environment of
the Taihu Lake today.
</P>
<P>
From December 18 to December 20, the network conducted a survey
of the water quality in Taihu Lake, by sampling water both in the
lake and in rivers around the lake.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that the area polluted with potassium
permanganate accounted for 71 percent of the lake, while the area
with high phosphorus-content makes up 53 percent of the lake. The
results indicated that the water pollution has reduced compared
with the same period in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Taihu lake is one of the three most-polluted lakes in China,
the other two are Dianchi in southwest China's Yunnan Province and
Chaohu Lake in east China's Anhui Province.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the tightened pollution control, about 80
percent of the 1,035 enterprises by the lake which have been
brought under inspection, reached the state requirements for waste
water discharge.
</P>
<P>
On January 1 of 1999, all the units will be restrained from
discharging waste water above the state requirements and the sales
and use of detergent with phosphorus will be completely banned
from the area.

NAIROBI, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Congolese President Laurent
Kabila has been in Tripoli for talks with Libyan Leader Muammar
Gaddafi on the Congo (K) conflicts since Friday, Libyan state
radio reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders held a lengthy meeting in the Libyan capital

civil war in the great lakes region, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
Libyan Foreign Minister Omar Mustafa Al-Montasser and a

Earlier this week a Congolese rebel delegation, led by chief
Ernest Wamba Dia Wamba, held talks with Gaddafi in Tripoli over
the war.
</P>
<P>
Gaddafi has been mediating the conflicts as friend of Kabila.

<HEADLINE> Stockholm Replaces Copenhagen as Tourism Capital in North Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Stockholm has taken the
title of tourism capital in North Europe from Copenhagen, capital
of Denmark, with 6.5 million tourist arrivals this year.
</P>
<P>
A total of 6.5 million tourists have visited the Swedish
capital so far this year, 3 million more than those who came to
Copenhagen during the same period, Stockholm city tourism
department said.
</P>
<P>
This is a 10 percent increase from that of 1997, said Goeran
Laangs, a tourism officer of Stockholm.
</P>
<P>
The number of tourists from Italy and Spain rose by 50 percent
and 30 percent respectively. The city also received more tourists
from Japan.
</P>
<P>
Tourism brings not only enormous revenues but also create job
opportunities for the city. Every 10 percent rise in tourist
arrivals will create 2,000 jobs, the officer said.
</P>
<P>
The increase in tourist arrivals was a result of strengthened
promotional work done by the Stockholm tourism department in
recent years in other European countries, the United States and
Japan.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that 20 modern hotels will be built in the
Swedish capital in the next ten years, he said.

<HEADLINE>   Oil Slide Said Not to Hurt GCC Currencies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, December 26 (Xinhua) -- The currencies of Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) member states are not likely to be
affected by the sagging oil prices in the world market, the head
of a major foreign exchange in the United Arab Emirates has said.
</P>
<P>
Bashar Al Jallad, president of the Forex, an organization of
foreign exchange and money market dealers, said "although oil
prices have dropped drastically in recent weeks, we do not expect
any threat to GCC currencies," the UAE's Gulf News reported on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"Most GCC economies are in good shape with strong currencies,"
Jallad said. He added that the monetary agencies in the GCC
countries have taken measures to ensure their currencies are well
protected.
</P>
<P>
Jallad said the threat to the Saudi national currency riyal was
well handled by the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority, the currency
has maintained its parity and the momentum will continue.
</P>
<P>
"The Saudi economy is strong and capable of handling any such
crisis," he said. "On the contrary, speculators now will not find
it profitable to speculate in any currency here."
</P>
<P>
According to Jallad, the fixed exchange mechanism with the UAE
currency pegged to the U.S. dollar is "the best at least for the
short term".
</P>
<P>
The fixed exchanged mechanism makes sense not only because oil
is traded in dollars, but also the U.S. economy is the biggest in
the world, he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Not to Accept Demand for Fissile Moratorium:FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz
said Saturday that Pakistan cannot accept any demand for a
moratorium on the production of fissile materials unilaterally or
multilaterally before the conclusion of a Fissile Material Cut-off
Treaty (FMCT).
</P>
<P>
In response to a question by an Opposition member at the
National Assembly, Aziz said the U.S. and other Western countries
are seeking an early moratorium on the production of fissile
materials under unilateral or multilateral arrangements, pending
the conclusion of FMCT.
</P>
<P>
"Given our genuine security concerns, we cannot agree to any
demand for a moratorium on the production of fissile materials,
unilaterally, or multilaterally, before the conclusion of, or
separately from, a Fissile Material Cut-off Treaty," Aziz said.
</P>
<P>
He said Pakistan's position on FMCT is based on principles. "We
believe that a fissile material treaty should be instrumental in
promoting both nuclear non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
A fissile material treaty aimed at only preventing further
proliferation of nuclear weapons would be discriminatory and thus
ineffective, said the foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
Aziz noted that Islamabad's another major concern is the
unequal stockpiles of fissile materials existing at the global,
regional and sub-regional levels.
</P>
<P>
"When the substantive negotiation starts on FMCT in Geneva next
year, Pakistan will pursue its position which is shared by a
majority of the non-aligned countries represented in the
Conference of Disarmament," Aziz added.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Allied Militiaman Killed in S. Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 26 (Xinhua) -- An official of the Israeli
allied South Lebanon Army (SLA) was killed Saturday by
unidentified gunmen in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Ghasan Daher, 32, a SLA's local security official, was shot
dead by a group of gunmen at his home in Shabba village inside the
Israeli occupied security zone in south Lebanon, the Voice of the
People radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The assassins escaped after the shooting, which has raised to
34 the number of SLA militiamen killed in south Lebanon since the
start of this year, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
Following the incident, SLA blocked all ways linked to the
rest of the village and launched a house-to-house search for
the murderers.
</P>
<P>
The killing of SLA official came at a time when the conflicts
are escalating between Israeli forces and the Iranian-backed
Hezbollah guerrillas who are leading a war trying to oust Israeli
forces and its proxy SLA out of the country.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out a self-declared security zone in south
Lebanon in 1985 with a claimed aim of protecting its north
from cross-border attacks by Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Last Tuesday, eight Lebanese guerrillas, including a mother
and her six children, were killed in Israeli air raids on the
country's eastern Bekaa Valley.
</P>
<P>
The next day, Hezbollah slammed scores of Katyusha rockets
into northern Israel in retaliation, wounding 16 Israelis.
</P>
<P>
The new wave of casualties Israeli forces suffered has once
again forced the Israeli government into reconsidering its policy
in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will chair a
cabinet meeting on Sunday to address a final way out for
his forces from the quagmire in the border enclave.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Over 10,000 Somalis have
crossed into Ethiopian territory fleeing the drought that hit
southern Somalia, The Ethiopian Herald reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Abubaker Abdi, representative of the
Disaster Prevention and Preparedness Bureau of Somali Region as
saying that the Somalis were displaced from the Gerkayu, Zerwery
and Peasnod localities of southern Somalia and are camped in
Warder and Afder areas of the region.
</P>
<P>
Abubaker said the arrival of such a great number of people in
the two areas which are already hard hit by food shortage makes
the problem even more critical.
</P>
<P>
He said his bureau and the authorities of the two areas have
notified the Federal Disaster Prevention and Preparedness
Commission in Addis Ababa and the eastern branch office of the
Refugees and Returnees Affairs Administration about the matter
and are waiting for a response.
</P>
<P>
Abubaker warned that the matter bears grave consequences
unless it is checked in time.

<HEADLINE> Manila Wants to Strike Peace With Rebels in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada said on Saturday that his administration wants to conclude
peace talks in 1999 with Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) and
National Democratic Front (NDF) rebels.
</P>
<P>
In a weekly radio interview, Estrada said: "We have to go ahead
on the peace process initiated by the past administration."
</P>
<P>
"We have to continue that because former President Fidel Ramos
was quite successful in negotiating with such rebel groups as the
MNLF (Moro National Liberation Front) and the AFP (Armed Forces of
the Philippines) Movement," he said.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said he has retained retired General Manuel Yan and
retired General Alexander Aguirre as the government's chief
negotiators with the rebel groups "so we will succeed in attaining
genuine peace."
</P>
<P>
The two retired generals served as chief government negotiators
during the Ramos administration, which kicked off its peace talks
with the NDF in 1993 and the MILF in 1996. But the negotiations
with the two groups stalled amid differences over certain issues.
</P>
<P>
The government's talks with the MILF have remained at the
committee levels as the rebel group insists on establishing a
separate Islamic republic in the south.
</P>
<P>
The government's talks with the NDF also hit a snag because the
group wants to implement a human right pact it earlier forged with
the government in accordance with their own constitution.

<HEADLINE> Mozambican Capital's Population Grows by 79% </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Population in Maputo, capital
of Mozambique, had grown to about 970,000 by August 1997 census,
427,100 more, or 79 percent more over the figure in 1980, when
the country conducted its first census.
</P>
<P>
The National Statistics Institute of Mozambique made the
announcement to the city parliament members Friday, the paper
Noticias reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The statistics institute said the population growth rate of
Maputo, the biggest city of this southern African country, was
3.4 percent during the period between the two censuses, almost
doubling the national average rate which was 1.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
During this period of time, the natural population growth
rate, or the birth rate minus mortality rate, stood at 2.8
percent, and the immigration from the countryside contributed to
the other 0.6 percent growth rate of the capital city's
population increase.
</P>
<P>
The second census showed that 40 percent of the city's
population were under 15, with an average age of 18.4, which
means that over half of the population were under 18.4 years of
age, and the above-65 age group took less than two percent.
</P>
<P>
The latest census indicates that the country had 16.5 million
people by August 1997.

<P>
LUSAKA, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Zambia has confiscated 7,000
tons of sorghum from Care International company which allegedly
contravened the Plant and Diseases Act when importing the grains,
Zambia Daily Mail reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
This came to light Thursday when Southern Province Deputy
Minister Elias Miyanda inspected the sheds stocking maize and
sorghum pending distribution to various parts of the province.
</P>
<P>
The grain was seized by the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and
Fisheries, suspecting it to contain fungi and other pest
diseases. But the report did not say where the sorghum came from.
</P>
<P>
If the phytosanitary examination in Mount Makulu Research
Station confirms the grain has problems, the sorghum would be
destroyed or dumped.
</P>
<P>
About 258,000 tons of wheat from the United States has also
been impounded in Chirundu bordering Zimbabwe, 200 kilometers
southeast of Lusaka earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
The wheat was suspected to be infested with Karnal Bunty, a
disease commonly found in America.

<HEADLINE> More Bulgarians Visit Theaters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Over 1.1 million Bulgarians, or
one in every eight people in this country, have visited
state-owned theaters in the outgoing year, up 10-15 percent from
the previous year.
</P>
<P>
As shown by official statistics released on Saturday, about 50
state-owned theaters across this East European country have put
up a total 5,720 shows in 1997 and earned an equivalent of some
700,000 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Sofia Film Director Aleksander Donev was quoted
by a Bulgarian Telegraph Agency report as saying, the number of
movie goers went up some 10 percent in the past year despite the
hike of ticket prices.
</P>
<P>
The upside, Donev said, is that the number of middle-aged
movie goers has been on the rise, as teenager types of films,
action films and those showing beatings and chases are less
popular during the last year and a half.
</P>
<P>
Blockbuster box office successes in Bulgaria were Titanic and
Armageddon, both from the United States, in 1998, the official
said.
</P>
<P>
However, he warned that tickets should not become more
expensive before more comfortable conditions, as well as audio
and video technologies, are provided in movie theaters.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Hit Heavily by Oil Smuggling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 26 (Xinhua) - Tanzania has lost
billions of Tanzania shillings in revenue from rampant smuggling
of petroleum products and tax evasion since last year's El Nino
rains, local newspapers reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Officials of major oil companies, quoted by the media, said
that the temporary disruption of communication systems by the El
Nino rains and the suspension of the major oil companies'
services initiated the petroleum smuggling from neighboring
Kenya, Malawi and other states.
</P>
<P>
Managers of BP Tanzania Limited, Agip Tanzania Limited,
Tanzania Service Station Limited, TOTAL and GAPCO said that major
oil companies in Tanzania are suffering an estimated 30 percent
loss of business due to the smuggling.
</P>
<P>
They said in the local market like in Mwanza and Kilimanjaro
regions, unscrupulous businessmen sell petrol at 400 shillings
and diesel at 330 shillings per liter while the official prices
are fixed at 420 shillings and 380 shillings per liter
respectively (1 U.S. Dollar equals to some Tanzania shillings).
</P>
<P>
"The smugglers naturally charge less because they do not pay
taxes to the government as is done by the major oil companies,"
one manager said.
</P>
<P>
Major oil dealing companies have called on the government to
take immediate and stern measures to stabilize the country's
troubled petroleum industry.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has restarted
the process of inviting bids for printing its national Identity
Cards (IDs) after canceling the tender to a British company.
</P>
<P>
Fourteen companies from different parts of the world have
applied for printing the cards, a project with an estimated cost
of 150 million U.S. Dollars, "The African" reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of the state-owned Central Tender Board N. Nkinga
said here Friday that a total of 33 companies have purchased the
documents for the tender but the majority of them prove to be
unqualified. However, he declined to name the companies, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
The successful bidder will print IDs for all Tanzanians
residing in the country and abroad, foreign missionaries and
their dependents living in Tanzania, foreign students studying in
the country and refugees.
</P>
<P>
A British company Regional Services Limited which had won the
previous tender to print some 20 million cards, has filed a suit
with the High Court challenging the cancellation by the Tanzanian
authorities.
</P>
<P>
The tender won by the British company was canceled on claims
that the bidding process was lack of transparency, sources said.

<HEADLINE> Difficult Year for Zimbabwe's Economy (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 26 (Xinhua) -- 1998 saw Zimbabwwe face a
difficult year with many challenges to its economy.
</P>
<P>
Low economic growth rate, high inflation and interest rates,
unstable exchange rate, poor export performance and social unrest
experienced this year, had a negative impact on the country's
overall economic performance.
</P>
<P>
The southern African country adjusted this year's economic
growth rate to less than 2.4 percent from an earlier forecast of
3.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The agricultural sector, the first major pillar of the
country's economy, is expected to grow merely by 3.2 percent this
year with most crops registering reduced yields because the El
Nino related bad weather forced farmers to reduce their sown
areas.
</P>
<P>
Maize, the Zimbabwean's staple food grain, is estimated to
yield 1.4 million tons this year, a decrease of 19.5 percent as
against that of last year, compelling the country to import about
500,000 tons from South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Tobacco, the country's biggest foreign currency earner,
contributes 25 percent to Zimbabwe's total foreign currency
earnings. Although the country harvested a generally better
quality crop of 210 million kilograms, a 7.7 percent increase
over last year, its earnings declined to just a little over 300
million U.S. Dollars from last year's near 400 million Dollars,
because tobacco prices have slumped by half this year.
</P>
<P>
In the manufacturing sector, Zimbabwe's second major economic
mainstay, big state-owned firms made huge losses and many
companies were forced to close down, though the sector was
projected to grow by 1.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The mining sector performed poorly since the beginning of
economic reforms in 1991 and prospects for improvement next year
are bleak due to depressed prices and rising production costs.
</P>
<P>
Inflation continued to be a major problem for Zimbabwe. The
average inflation rate for 1997 was 18.9 percent. It raised to 34
percent in November this year. The country's inflationary
tendencies are much greater than its regional and international
trading partners, rendering its exports less-competitive.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean Dollar continued to fall since 1997 and the
exchange rate has plummeted from 16 Zimbabwean Dollars against
one U.S. Dollar at the beginning of this year to 36 against one
U.S. Dollar at present.

<HEADLINE> Difficult Year for Zimbabwe's Economy (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Zimbabwe's stock market, Africa's second largest one, has also
been hard hit resulting in a decline in market capitalization of
45 percent over the past year. The industrial index declined by
41.6 percent while the mining index dropped by 57.7 percent in
late September this year.
</P>
<P>
This year's budget deficit reportedly will be about 7.4
percent of the gross domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
Unemployment rate of 50 percent and the 45 percent interest
rate also constituted major challenges to the country. High
unemployment rate has been described as "a time bomb" and high
interest rate forced quite a number of factories and mines to
collapse.
</P>
<P>
Observers here held that poor macro-economic performance came
from three factors:
</P>
<P>
Firstly, the southeast Asian financial crisis has had severe
adverse effect on Zimbabwe's economy. Some Asian countries have
withdrawn their orders of importing Zimbabwe's tobacco and
mineral products. This year's export is projected at nine percent
below last year's level.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, poor rains during the past two years and low mineral
prices on the world market have eroded the country's two main
sources of income, thus affecting business and the livelihood of
the people.
</P>
<P>
Over 60 percent of the Zimbabwean people now live in poverty,
causing social unrest. Strikes, demonstrations and riots against
the government took place one after another this year, and
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, Zimbabwe's involvement in the war of the Democratic
Republic of Congo further deteriorated the country's economy.
Zimbabwe sent more than 6,000 troops to support Congolese
president Laurent Kabila to fight the rebels who want to topple
the Kabila government. Zimbabwe's opposition parties and the
trade unions demanded that the government publish the expenditure
in the war along with figures of injuries and deaths.
</P>
<P>
When the 1999 new year is coming, the Zimbabweans are
gratified that the government, business sectors and the labor
movement have agreed to hold a tripartite meeting to seek ways of
improving the deteriorating economy.
</P>
<P>
In his state of the nation address to parliament on December
23, President Robert Mugabe noted that 1998 has been a difficult
year which presented many challenges both to the government and
the general populace. However, he said, "My government is
convinced that the future holds better prospects for the nation."

CANBERRA, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Race favorites Sayonara and
Brindabella staged an early duel at the start of Saturday's
Sydney-to-Hobart yacht race, although the American maxi suffered
a setback after it was first out of Sydney Heads.
</P>
<P>
Sayonara, the world maxi champion, led at the first marker but
lost her first spinnaker shortly after passing through the heads
out of Sydney Harbor.

<P>
The setback allowed Brindabella, last year's line honors
winner, to draw level with Sayonara after the latter bolted clear
following a strong start.

There was excitement at the start when Nokia, the biggest boat

Early placings followed the favored list with Australian maxi

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Studies Possible Impact of Euro on Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh is studying the
possible impact of euro, the single European currency to be
introduced by the European Union at the beginning next year, on
its economy.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladesh Bank, the central bank, has formed a five-member
committee to examine the possible impact of the new money on the
country's external trade, press reports said Saturday, quoting
bank officials.
</P>
<P>
Banks, both local and foreign, would be allowed transactions in
the new European currency upon recommendations by the committee
comprising bankers and private sector representatives, they said.
</P>
<P>
"We have nothing to hurry," Bangladesh Bank Governor Dr
Mohammad Farashuddin said.
</P>
<P>
About 45 percent of Bangladesh' exports go to the European
Union countries, but taka, the Bangladeshi currency, is pegged to
the U.S. dollar and the banks operating in the country would not
immediately ask to handle transactions in the new currency, the
governor said.
</P>
<P>
The euro would be available for business transactions from next
January and the currency notes are coming only after three years
from 2000. "It will give us the necessary time to adjust," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The effective exchange rate in Bangladesh is determined on the
basis of the currency basket, according to Farashuddin.
</P>
<P>
After the study, the central bank is expected to issue a
circular permitting banks to open euro accounts for transactions
related to exports, imports and remittances, and only then, the
banks could accept euro deposits in the country and determine
rates of exchange, he added.

<HEADLINE> Thai Armed Forces Face Big Cut in Spending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's armed forces may
get only about half of their combined spending budget of more than
112 billion baht (3.1 billion U.S. dollars) proposed for the next
fiscal year, Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai has said.
</P>
<P>
Chuan, also defense minister, informed the Defense Council of
the prospect of a hefty cut in their proposed budget during a
two-hour meeting last week, Saturday's Bangkok Post reported.
</P>
<P>
Chuan said the chance for new purchase of weapons would remain
open provided they were really needed for national security.
</P>
<P>
He said that despite hefty cuts the defense budget for fiscal
2000 would still be higher than for the current fiscal year ending
next September.
</P>
<P>
Chuan promised to try to convince the cabinet to allow the
armed forces to have more than half of their proposed budget of
112.881 baht (3.14 billion dollars), of which 60 percent has been
earmarked for salaries, 30 percent for repayment of debts incurred
from arms purchases, and the remaining 10 percent for purchases of
new equipment.
</P>
<P>
Military sources said much of the budget would be spent on
small ammunition which had not been purchased by the armed forces
over the past two years.

<HEADLINE> Khieu Samphan, Nuon Chea Defect to Cambodian Govt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Khieu Samphan and Nuon
Chea, the remaining Khmer Rouge hard-line leaders, defected to the
Royal Government of Cambodia Friday evening in Pailin, the Bayon
Radio reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The two said they respected and highly praised the role played
by King Norodom Sihanouk. They also pledged they will recognize
Cambodia's Constitutions and the Royal Government, and said they
wish to return to the society as a civilian.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Cambodia's Prime Minister Hun Sen has contacted with
Khieu Samphan through telephone to welcome their defection.
</P>
<P>
Khmer Rouge military leader Ta Mok, political leader Khieu
Samphan and former party number two Nuon Chea are the three
hard-line leaders remaining following the death of Pol Pot in
April. They were also left isolated by the disintegration of the
movement.
</P>
<P>
The last of Ta Mok's dwindling guerrilla army announced a
defection deal with the government on December 4.
</P>
<P>
Pailin officials said Khieu Samphan is well known in the former
rebel strongholds of Malai and Pailin and that he has many close
friends in Pailin, which is host to other Khmer Rouge
intellectuals and leaders, including former Khmer Rouge deputy
premier Ieng Sary.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that before their defection, the two had sent
letters separately to Prime Minister Hun Sen expressing their
wishes to return to the Royal Government.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen expressed his welcome after he got the support of King
Sihanouk who is in Beijing for a routine health checkup.
</P>
<P>
In his letter afterwards to Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea, Hun
Sen highly praised their deeds. He said their defection will
greatly enhance the peace, reconciliation and the unity of the
nation and the country.

<HEADLINE> Thai Officials Try to Save National on Death Row </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 26 (Xinhua) -- The Thai Foreign Ministry has
been trying to save a Thai national on death row in California,
claiming the legal process was undue and calling for clemency.
</P>
<P>
A foreign ministry official on Saturday confirmed newspaper
reports that Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan personally got
involved in the effort, having written to incoming California
governor Gray Davis asking him to review the sentence.
</P>
<P>
Jaturun Siripongs, 43, was convicted of killing his boss, the
owner of a neighborhood Thai market where he worked on weekends,
and a market worker. He was sentenced to death.
</P>
<P>
A judge earlier this month rescheduled the execution for
February 9, putting the question of possible clemency before Davis
who is due to take office in January.
</P>
<P>
Outgoing governor Pete Wilso rejected an initial clemency plea
in November, but hours before the execution was scheduled to take
place a federal judge issued a temporary stay.
</P>
<P>
Surin said in the letter that the legal process had yet to be
completed, according to the official who refused to be named.
</P>
<P>
Surin would also make a telephone call to his U.S. counterpart,
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, asking for clemency.
</P>
<P>
Surin's letter also alleged that Thai diplomats were denied
consular access to Jaturun before and during his trial.
</P>
<P>
Jaturun had acknowledged that he was present during the crime
in the town of Garden Grove southeast of Los Angeles but has said
that an accomplice committed the murders.
</P>
<P>
He has refused to name the accomplice, saying he feared
retaliation against his family.
</P>
<P>
Among those pleading for him is Surachia Wattanaporn, the
husband of one of the victims, a prison guard, and two members of
the jury that originally sentenced him to die.

<HEADLINE> Slump Leads to Better Air Quality Over Bangkok </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Air quality over Bangkok has
become cleaner because of the economic slump which has led to
fewer dust particles and less fume emissions, Thai
environmentalists said.
</P>
<P>
Reduced construction activity has cut the amount of dust in the
air which is below standard in residential areas, the Pollution
Control Department said in a statement, made public on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Automobile emissions, although they remain twice as high as the
acceptable standard, have improved considerably since the
financial crisis began last year, compared with two years ago when
the emissions were seven times higher, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Because of the slump, many people went to work by bus instead
of driving cars, thus reducing the number of cars on the streets,
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
However, Bangkok residents are still at risk from increasing
ozone in the atmosphere in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
Although the ozone layer in the stratosphere protects the earth
from dangerous ultraviolet radiation, ozone in the lower
atmosphere poses a health hazard.
</P>
<P>
Ozone content in the atmosphere above Bangkok has been measured
at between 0.25 and 0.28 milligram per cubic meter of air compared
to the acceptable standard of 0.2 mg/cubic meter, according to the
department.
</P>
<P>
The situation deteriorates in summer, particularly in the
northern part of Bangkok which is downwind.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Moves to Help Tourism, Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 26 (Xinhua) -- After focusing on financial
problems of the country for more than one year, the Thai
government is to put tourism and agricultural sectors to a higher
place under a new economic action plan for next year, the Bangkok
Post reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Boonchu Rojanastien, the prime minister's economic adviser,
said he was confident the action plan would help create income and
put the economy back on track after the first quarter of next
year.
</P>
<P>
With contractions contained, he said, the government would be
better able to breathe new life into the economy.
</P>
<P>
The new action plan shows that the Democrat-led government,
which has so far concentrated its effort on bailing out troubled
financial institutions, has decided it is time to fix the ailing
real sector.
</P>
<P>
Tourism, one of the country's top foreign exchange earners,
will be among the action plan's priority targets.
</P>
<P>
The government has drawn a blueprint for the macro-management
of the tourism industry, which is to be revamped to upgrade the
standard of tourism services.
</P>
<P>
Public transport will also be improved. Labor-intensive
sectors, like transport and tourism, would help ease unemployment,
Boonchu said.
</P>
<P>
On the agricultural front, water distribution is to be
emphasized as state funds are to be invested in strategic
irrigation systems to ensure water supplies in the order of
urgency.
</P>
<P>
Funding for the action plan could either come directly from
government offers or from loans, Boonchu said.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Government Adopts Fiscal 1999 Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, December 25 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese government
approved Friday a record 81.86 trillion yen (about 705.7 billion
U.S. dollars) national budget for fiscal 1999, which starts next
April 1.
</P>
<P>
The budget, 5.4 percent larger than the initial budget for
fiscal 1998, is aimed at lifting the Japanese economy out of its
longest and deepest recession since the end of World War II,
observers said.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa hailed the budget as the best
possible way to achieve the government's forecast of 0.5 percent
economic growth for fiscal 1999 -- the first positive growth in
three years.
</P>
<P>
Spending on public works projects provided for in the proposed
budget plan is up by 5 percent to 9,430.0 billion yen (81.3
billion dollars) over the initial budget for the current fiscal
year, ending next March 31.
</P>
<P>
Another key pillar of the budget plan, now pending the
approval of the Diet, or the Japanese parliament, when it meets
on January 19 next year, is a record 9.4 trillion yen (81 billion
dollars) worth of tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
To finance the budget, the government will have to float a
record 31.05 trillion yen (267.7 billion dollars) in new bonds,
bringing the balance of outstanding bonds to some 327 trillion
yen (2,818.9 billion dollars) at the end of March 2000.
</P>
<P>
The defense budget was cut for the second straight years to
4,932.2 billion yen (42.5 billion dollars), down 0.2 percent.
Japan's defense spending was curtailed for the first time in
fiscal 1998 since the Defense Agency was set up in 1954.
</P>
<P>
Japan's Official Development Assistance (ODA), which was cut
for the first time in fiscal 1998, rises by 0.2 percent to
1,048.9 billion yen (9.0 billion dollars) in the new budget.
</P>
<P>
The ODA budget includes 20 billion yen (172 million dollars)
for a fund within the Asian Development Bank to help
crisis-stricken Asian countries raise funds.

HANOI, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's consumer price index
of 1998 increased by 9.2 percent over last year's figure, Vietnam
News Agency (VNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Foodgrain and foodstuff registered the highest yearly price
rise at 23.1 and 8.6 percent, followed by education, 9.6 percent,
and pharmaceuticals and medical service, 8.7 percent, VNA quoted
Vietnam's General Department of Statistics as saying.
</P>
<P>
The prices of drinks, cigarettes, garments, headgear, footwear,
transportation and post service cost rose between 2.3-5.3 percent
for the year, and a mere 0.3 percent in December.
</P>
<P>
The costs of construction materials and household appliances
rose slightly through the year, with 1.7 and 3.2 percent over that
of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The price of gold rose only 0.7 percent. And compared with last
month, the gold price dropped 0.1 percent in Hanoi and 0.3 percent
in Ho Chi Minh City.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the exchange rate for the U.S. dollar
increased by 9.6 percent compared with last year, but fell 0.4
percent compared with November.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's market experts predict that the price for foodgrain
will continue to rise next month due to the Vietnamese
government's measures to adjust the paddy rice price in order to
stimulate purchasing power in rural areas. The price for
industrial consumer goods is also expected to rise due to the
upcoming Lunar New Year, which falls on February 16, but at a
modest level.

CANBERRA, December 26 (Xinhua) -- The Australian government
will investigate claims that female tennis players had been
subjected to starvation diets and verbal abuse at the Australian
Institute of Sport (AIS), according to reports from Sydney.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Rights Campaigner: A Year of Unresolved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's leading rights
campaigner Marzuki Darusman described 1998 as the year when
unresolved cases of violations were the "most visible dimension"
of the country's rights situation.
</P>
<P>
"The unresolved cases are the very symbol of human rights
transgressions," Marzuki was quoted by the Jakarta Post Saturday
as saying.
</P>
<P>
The unresolved cases stood out, Marzuki said, in spite of the
government's commitment and its "rhetoric" in the form of the
National Action Plan for Human Rights launched in June, the human
rights charter that was passed in the special session of the
People's Consultative Assembly in November, and the possible
submission of a bill to reinforce the existence of the National
Commission on Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
The situation was a paradox and a major challenge to the
government's actual commitment, Marzuki said, adding that the
potential for violence remained large given the economic and
political uncertainty here.
</P>
<P>
The downfall of former president Soeharto in May led to the
revelation of serious human rights abuses allegedly perpetrated by
Armed Forces personnel.
</P>
<P>
Former Army Special Forces (Kopassus) Commander Lt. Gen. (ret)
Prabowo Subianto was discharged from the military in August and
two other Kopassus senior officers were released from active duty
for their alleged involvement in the abductions of political and
student activists earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
Public pressure has been mounting on the Armed Forces Commander
Gen. Wiranto to put Prabowo, Soeharto's son-in-law, on trial for
his involvement in the kidnappings, but the demand is still unmet.
</P>
<P>
Marzuki recommended that military personnel who committed
abuses should be brought before a civilian court, rather than a
military tribunal, in order to ensure impartiality.
</P>
<P>
Human rights groups have said that it is almost impossible for
military judges and prosecutors to act independently because they
bow to their superiors' command.
</P>
<P>
The rights groups said independent bodies should be given the
power to investigate military personnel for alleged human rights
violations.

<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, December 25 (Xinhua) -- The Peruvian authorities Friday
reported significant achievement in the nation's fight against
drugs in the outgoing year, as official statistics showed the
country no longer the biggest coca producer in the world.
</P>
<P>
A total of 13,719 people were arrested in police antidrug
operations in 1998, with 2,797 charged with illicit drug
trafficking and 10,922 with drug consumption. Police seized 35
tons of drugs and destroyed 11 underground factories.
</P>
<P>
Coca leaf cultivation has been reduced by 5,152 hectares from
69,000 hectares in 1997, as many coca cultivators turned to other
profitable crops under the government's 1998-2000 National Plan
of War Against Drugs.
</P>
<P>
The plan aims to cut the country's coca cultivation by half in
the next five years and to eliminate it all in 10 years.

<HEADLINE> Young Chinese PR Companies Grow Fast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 26 (Xinhua) -- A survey shows that domestic
public relations (PR) companies in major cities are growing faster
than overseas-funded ones in China, China Daily reports today.
</P>
<P>
The growth of the local PR industry is indicated in the
increase of the number of employees. Nine firms surveyed by the
Chinese International Public Relations Association (CIPRA) in
major cities, like Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, had more than
30 employees each.
</P>
<P>
Annual sales of the surveyed domestic PR companies reached or
approached 20 million yuan (2.4 million U.S. dollars), with
annual growth rates of more than 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, the local companies are no match for their
overseas-funded counterparts, said Professor Guo Huimin, deputy
general secretary of CIPRA.
</P>
<P>
"The major services now provided by some local PR companies are
what foreign-invested companies did years ago," Guo was quoted by
the paper as saying. They lack experience and "are doing more
communication work like publicity for their clients instead of
offering consulting services."
</P>
<P>
Guo called for more cooperation between domestic and
overseas-funded PR companies. He said: "The two sides can
complement each other in business."
</P>
<P>
Guo pinpointed four major problems for China's present PR
market: frequent outflow of experienced personnel, imperfect
market regulations, inconsistent service quality and insufficient
awareness of the PR needs from domestic enterprises.

<P>
BEIJING, December 26 (Xinhua) -- China will keep a closer rein
on earthquake forecast information to forestall false alarms set
off by rumors, today's China Daily reports.
</P>
<P>
"All work units and individuals should not release their
earthquake forecast results to society or abroad without the
permission of the State," the paper quoted a regulation endorsed
by Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji on December 17 as saying.
</P>
<P>
Quake forecasts and related reports should only be released by
the State. Nationwide earthquakes predicted to strike in up to 10
years are to be announced by the State Council, according to the
regulation.
</P>
<P>
Provincial governments are responsible for quake forecasts in
their localities.
</P>
<P>
Individuals should report immediately to governments when they
observe abnormal natural phenomenon which may indicate potential
earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
Quake forecasts should highlight their scientific nature and
the potential effects on the social and economic life.
</P>
<P>
The regulation also requires media to abide by the regulation
when news about earthquake forecasts is released.
</P>
<P>
China announced this week, that ti will spend 2.5 billion yuan
over the next five years on basic research programs, including the
application of the forecasting of strong earthquakes and other
natural disasters, according to the paper.

MANILA, December 26 (Xinhua) -- A Senate committee of the
Philippines has recommended criminal charges against the former
chief of the Armed Forces' Retirement Separation and Benefit
System (RSBS) and eight lawyers for alleged multi-billion-peso
anomalous deals, the Philippine Star said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The recommendation was contained in a six-page initial report

land scam of 2 billion pesos (50 million U.S. dollars), the

</P>
<P>
Senator Aquilino Pimentel was quoted as saying that the
committee recommended the filing in court of falsification of
public documents, tax evasion and disbarment against the lawyers.
</P>
<P>
Those cited for criminal prosecution are retired General Jose
Ramiscal, the former RSBS president, and lawyers involved in the
purchase of lands.
</P>
<P>
Pimentel said the scam was carried out by preparing two sets of
deeds of sale. One contained the actual price of the land while
the second embodied the padded price.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo's Historical Perception Unchanged, Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, December 25 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese government's
historical perception remains unchanged despite a recent court
ruling involving the 1937 Nanjing Massacre committed by the
Japanese army, Foreign Ministry spokesman Sadaaki Numata said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
"It was a civil libel case not involving the government, and
the ruling had nothing to do with judging the historical facts of
the Nanjing incident," Numata said.
</P>
<P>
"Our historical perception remains unchanged ... about the
fact the massacre of civilians (in the Chinese city of Nanjing)
occurred," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the Tokyo High Court rejected World War II
Japanese soldier Shiro Azuma's appeal challenging a district
court ruling on his personal diary.
</P>
<P>
Azuma, 86, witnessed and kept a diary on the hair-raising
killings of Chinese servicemen and civilians by the Japanese army
in the attack on Nanjing in 1937.
</P>
<P>
Azuma published the personal diary in which he recorded the
atrocities committed by Japanese soldiers and mentioned by name
some of those who perpetrated the bloody deeds.
</P>
<P>
In the spring of 1993, Koji Hashimoto, one of the soldiers
mentioned in the diary, sued Azuma for "damaging his reputation."
</P>
<P>
On April 26, 1994, the Tokyo District Court ruled that the
Azuma diary "was judged as being unnatural by common sense" and
that Azuma pay the plaintiff 500,000 yen (about 4,310 U.S.
dollars) in "compensation for damage to his reputation."
</P>
<P>
Azuma then appealed to the High Court of Tokyo.

<HEADLINE> Briton Branson Forced to End Round-the-world Balloon Attempt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 25 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Richard Branson
on Friday abandoned his attempt to be the first to circle the
world non-stop in a balloon after hitting a weather trough over
the Pacific Ocean, according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The ICO Global Challenge balloon, carrying Branson, Swedish
balloonist Per Lindstrand and American Steve Fossett, was
expected to land near Honolulu at 8 a.m. (1800 GMT), the US Coast
Guard said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking from the balloon capsule, Branson said: "I am sorry
that it is now all over. We raced across the Pacific in winds of
up to 200 miles per hour (320 kilometers per hour) but ended up
hitting a solid trough from one end to the other.
</P>
<P>
Unfavourable weather conditions had also been pushing the
balloon in the wrong direction, south rather than east across the
Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
The changing weather conditions beat Branson and his crew
because as the balloon lost speed it sank too low to regain the
necessary altitude and was running out of the fuel needed to keep
it aloft and heat the cabin.
</P>
<P>
The balloon left Morocco on December 18 and the team crossed
the half-way point Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Both Branson and Fossett have failed in previous bids for the
record.
</P>
<P>
Fossett crashed in the Coral Sea off northeast Australia
during
an attempt earlier this year while in 1996 Branson made a
forced landing in Algeria less than 24 hours after take-off.
</P>
<P>
Last year his balloon broke free from its moorings while it
was being inflated.

<HEADLINE> Researchers Say Candy May Help You Live Little Longer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 25 (Xinhua) -- A new study by
researchers from the Harvard School of Public Health suggests
that a piece of candy now and then may help you live longer.
</P>
<P>
This is a conclusion reached after studying the relationship
between candy consumption and mortality among 7841 men who were
Harvard students between 1916 and 1950, the Washington Post
reported recently.
</P>
<P>
They found that those in 1988 who consumed a "moderate"
amount of candy-between one and three a week-tended to live
about a year longer than those who denied their sweet tooth.
Those who ate three or more candies a week tended not to live as
long, but still longer than those who abstained from confections
altogether.
</P>
<P>
The researchers said no one knows why this would be true, but
chocolate does contain the same kind of so-called antioxidants
found in red wine that may help cut the risk for cancer and
heart disease.
