WHITE CAPTAIN IS MADE POLICE CHEF TO SETTLE N.J. BIAS SUIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   NEWAR, N.J. _ Settling a discrimination lawsuit in U.S.
District Court here, the city of East Orange agreed Tuesday to the
forced retirement of its first black police chief and to the
immediate promotion to chief of a white police captain who had
accused the city of illegal discrimination eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The captain, Richard Wright, a 30-year veteran of the East
Orange police force, became acting chief at noon Tuesday, minutes
after the settlement was read into the record before Judge Nicholas
Politan in U.S. District Court in Newark. In settling the case on
the day it was scheduled to go to a jury, East Orange agreed to
give Wright $50,000 in back pay, less than the actual difference
over eight years between the salary of a captain and a chief and
far less than what a jury might have awarded had it found in his
favor.
</P>
<P>
   At the crux of the settlement is the forced retirement of Chief
Harry Harman, a former lieutenant who became East Orange's first
black police chief when he was appointed by Mayor Cardell Cooper in
1990. Under departmental pension rules, Harman is not eligible for
retirement until later this month, and he has been placed on
administrative leave until then. The current mayor of East Orange,
Robert Bowser, helped arrange Tuesday's settlement.
</P>
<P>
   For Bowser, a black mayor of a predominantly black city, the
case was perhaps the thorniest political issue left behind by his
predecessor, Cooper. Several witnesses testified during the trial
that Cooper, who is also black, had been under pressure from black
ministers and black members of the City Council to appoint a black
police chief. Those pressures are felt in cities around the
country, where tensions can exist between minority residents and
mostly white police forces.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony Monday, Cooper defended his appointment of Harman,
saying he was proud to have made it even as he maintained that race
had not been a factor. But he also testified that he never
considered other candidates, a decision easy to criticize
considering Wright's credentials: highest in his class at the
police academy, and consistently a top scorer on exams for
promotion, including the exam for chief. Out of the 11 people who
passed the chief's test, Harman placed sixth.
</P>
<P>
   While the city did not acknowledge wrongdoing in settling the
case and was not required to apologize to Wright, Bowser and other
officials said they decided to settle because they expected to lose
the case, largely because of the testimony of Cooper, and wanted to
avoid the possibility of heavy damages and a costly appealing.
``Given all the factors involved in this case, it is better to cut
our losses at this point,'' Bowser said.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Tuesday evening outside City Hall, where he
was joined by the new police chief, Bowser announced the city's
decision to settle what he called a ``reverse racism lawsuit,'' and
said he feared the case could have been fiscally devastating.
``Following my predecessor Cardell Cooper's testimony yesterday at
the trial, we realized that any effort by the city to prolong this
case would have placed the taxpayers in a position of losing
millions of dollars,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The case has already cost the city hundreds of thousands in
legal bills, he said. Bowser said the settlement would cost East
Orange more than $180,000, including $106,000 to cover Wright's
legal fees. After Harman's forced retirement, Bowser said he would
appoint Wright chief, for which the salary is $91,000 a year. Once
the appointment is confirmed by the City Council, Wright will serve
as chief through 1999, the mayor said.
</P>
<P>
   During a two-week trial, Wright's lawyer, Stephen Klausner,
presented several witnesses who testified that Cooper had pledged
to appoint a black police chief and had expressed an unwillingness
to consider anyone for the job who was not black.
</P>
<P>
   Bowser said Tuesday that Harman stood to lose the most if a jury
ruled against the city, because he might have been returned to his
previous rank of lieutenant. If the jury had found the city liable,
it also would have complicated things for Cooper, the former mayor,
who was nominated by President Clinton in July to be assistant
secretary for community planning and development at the Department
of Housing and Urban Development.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Republicans' chief investigative counsel held
open the possibility Tuesday that Congress could still consider
whether President Clinton abused the power of his office by
asserting legal privileges in the investigation by Whitewater
independent counsel Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Investigative counsel David Schippers explained in a briefing
Tuesday that in his presentation on Monday to the House Judiciary
Committee, he had made a judgment call to omit the abuse of power
offense proposed by Starr. But Schippers, a former prosecutor,
virtually called on the committee to investigate further, saying
the abuse of power accusation was still ``something that should be
looked into in an inquiry.''
</P>
<P>
   Schippers, a Democrat who will be the Republicans' senior aide
in the investigation of the president, had expanded the list of
possibly impeachable offenses to 15 from the 11 presented by Starr,
and included a broad new accusation of a conspiracy to obstruct
justice.
</P>
<P>
   But in omitting two of Starr's most controversial charges _
abuse of power and obstruction of justice when Clinton delayed
appearing before a grand jury _ Schippers said he ``did not intend
in any way to cast doubt'' on Starr's case.
</P>
<P>
   Some legal experts and House Democrats said Schippers, by
referring to false statements under oath instead of to perjury, had
turned to less serious charges requiring a lower threshold of
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``This appears to be a fallback on the part of the Republicans
by charging acts that are easier to establish,'' said Jeffrey
Weiner, a Miami lawyer and past president of the National
Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. ``But it could backfire
because the question becomes, `Do these lesser crimes rise to the
level of a high crime or misdemeanor?'''
</P>
<P>
   But Schippers said Tuesday that he had chosen specific language
to make the case ``a little more understandable'' and that he was
still looking at violations of perjury statutes. He also noted that
some aspects of the case, particularly his exploration of whether a
conspiracy had been committed, could be more difficult to prove
than a straightforward charge.
</P>
<P>
   In raising the conspiracy charge, Schippers said ``there was
evidence tending to prove'' that at least the president and Monica
Lewinsky had conspired to obstruct justice by giving false
testimony in the Paula Jones sexual misconduct case.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of where the congressional inquiry is likely to move,
Schippers said he believed that several other individuals were
involved in the conspiracy but did not have sufficient evidence to
name them.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, he bolstered his conspiracy accusation by using phone
logs compiled by Starr's office that documented a flurry of calls
back and forth shortly after Clinton's deposition in the Jones case
on Jan. 17. The calls were between the president, his friend Vernon
Jordan, his secretary Betty Currie; and Bruce Lindsey, of the White
House counsel's office. Some calls were repeated attempts to reach
Ms. Lewinsky through her pager. Democrats say the calls were simply
efforts at political damage control because of an expected spate of
news reports.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's lawyers have accused Starr of omitting from his report
Ms. Lewinsky's testimony before a grand jury that no one had told
her to lie about her relationship with Clinton and that no one had
promised her a job for her silence when she filed a false affidavit
in the Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one asked her to tell the truth, either,'' Schippers said.
``Based on my reading of the record, `no one asked me to lie' is a
term of art.''
</P>
<P>
   While he provided a framework for the investigation into
Clinton, several Republicans on the Judiciary Committee said
Tuesday that the committee _ and not Starr or Schippers _ would
ultimately decide what charges, if any, would be brought against
the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not bound by either interpretation,'' said Rep. James
Rogan, R-Calif., a former judge.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., a former federal prosecutor, said:
``There are three major areas here, allegations of perjury,
obstruction of justice, abuse of power. Any good prosecutor might
break that down in different ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said that despite Schippers' detailing of 15 charges
against the president, Republicans still had a political problem
because the charges all revolved around Clinton's efforts to hide
his affair.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., said of the 15 possible charges:
``It looks like a recipe book with 15 ways to cook spinach. But
it's still about spinach. This is still about sex.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Some Democrats and legal experts also said Schippers had
stretched in making some charges. They pointed to the charge that
Clinton might have engaged in ``misprision'' of a felony in Ms.
Lewinsky's submitting a false affidavit. The crime is a common law
crime against someone who knows a felony has been committed and
fails to report it to the authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Weiner, the Miami lawyer, said that while the charge was still a
federal crime, it was no longer used in most states.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though many lawyers don't know what this is because it's
so rare,'' he said, ``the Republicans must be using this because
it's so simple to understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Schippers Tuesday that such a crime was ``charged quite a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Michael Fortier, who had not warned anyone of the
Oklahoma City bombing in 1995, pleaded guilty to misprision of
felony. Fortier had heard of the bombing plot from his friend,
Timothy McVeigh, but did not tell the authorities.
</P>
<P>
   And in a high-profile case in Louisiana on Tuesday, San
Francisco 49ers co-owner Eddie DeBartolo Jr. pleaded guilty to
misprision of a felony for failing to tell the authorities about a
supposed plan by former Louisiana Gov. Edwin Edwards to extract
payoffs for a riverboat casino license.
</P>
<P>
   Schippers rebutted the suggestion that he had stacked up several
felony charges for the same action.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aiding and abetting a felony,'' he said, ``is different than
committing the felony yourself.''

SPORTS COLUMN: DAVID WELLS _ AN OUTSIDER WHO BECAME AN INSIDER 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ He chose this uniform as his symbol of the
establishment, the mark of excellence. He was the outsider, and he
loved the New York Yankees, the classic insiders.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, David Wells kept moving toward major long-term
Yankee status, beating the Cleveland Indians, 7-2, in the first
game of the American League Championship Series. Wells now has a
6-1 record in post-season and had not given up a run in his last 23
innings in the post-season until yielding a two-run homer to Manny
Ramirez in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a rudimentary mustache and goatee, against the
clean-shaven Steinbrennerian standards, Wells struck out seven
batters. Each strikeout was noted by a No. 39 shirt hanging from
the upper deck, a tribute to the recuperating Darryl Strawberry.
</P>
<P>
   The Yanks went into the game still spluttering to themselves
about the inside pitches earlier this year from Cleveland's Jaret
Wright, who learned his intimidating tactics from his father,
Clyde, also a major league pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   If memory serves, there was also a knockdown mentality in
Seattle early this season, with Junior Griffey being low-bridged
two or three times by none other than David Wells.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the pitches that forced Griffey to perform the
limbo, and then glare balefully toward the mound, Wells snorted and
replied, ``If he can't take a joke, the heck with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells is a throwback to the grumpy pitchers of three and four
decades ago, but he practices a certain egalitarianism that
occasionally leads him to head-butt his own manager and gesticulate
when his own fielders botch a ball behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boomer is Boomer,'' Joe Torre says, rather frequently.
</P>
<P>
   There are dozens of major leaguers who carry a sense of
entitlement through their fathers, who learned the game as children
scuttling around big-league clubhouses _ the Stottlemyres and
Griffeys, the McRaes and Bondses, the Hundleys and Boones.
</P>
<P>
   Wells did not meet his father until he was an adult, by which
time he had developed his own blunt, sometimes bumptious
personality. He grew up around San Diego, familiar with the vroom
of motorcycles and the splash of poured beer, and his baseball
loyalties extended across the continent to the team with the
history of October bunting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Growing up in San Diego, being a Padre fan, being a Yankee
fan, I had to have an American League team,'' Wells said the other
day, adding that he had ``started early, just watching old films of
Yankee baseball, the tradition, all the winning teams they have
had, and to me it was awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, how can you not be a big fan of Yankee tradition with
all the greats they have had?'' Wells added. ``Just watching old
films of all the players and just the way things have happened for
this organization, and just the way they have played.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have been very aggressive. Everybody hated them and, as a
kid, people hated certain teams that I liked. I was totally the
opposite. But just wanting to be in this city and hearing so many
stories about New York just made it even better.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells chose to come to the Yankees in 1997, and the Yankees took
awhile to warm up to him, but there was no missing his childlike
zest at being a Yankee. He even slipped on an authentic Babe Ruth
cap he had bought from a collector and wore it for an inning
against these very same Indians, until the Cap Police noticed him
and set off the warning Klaxons.
</P>
<P>
   ``That shows how much of a Yankee fan I am,'' he said. ``Not
only Babe Ruth, but the Yankees in general.''
</P>
<P>
   He loved pitching in Yankee Stadium, even before his perfect
game last spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I had the opportunity, I got goose bumps walking out here
because you walk out to that monument, you see all the legends that
have played in this stadium,'' Wells said Monday. ``I was saying to
myself, hopefully, one day I can be in that monument and be part of
this. But I am a part of this, and I feel that every time I go out
there, it just helps me out, mentally and physically.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells made a huge leap in 1998, the perfect game being only a
side product. As David Cone said Tuesday night: ``We saw a
different David Wells this year. He battled the whole year long.
Never gave in and he really worked on his craft. I think he is a
much more cerebral pitcher _ if that is possible to say about David
Wells.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells put the Texas Rangers in an instant slump in the division
series. Tuesday night he may have set a tone for this series, in
the ball park of his childhood dreams.

CORNERBACK PUTS PERSONAL TOUCH ON FAN INTERACTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RALEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Fred Thomas rises from the Kingdome Astroturf after
making a big play for the Seahawks, crosses his wrists and starts
wiggling his fingers.
</P>
<P>
   Fans imitate him, roaring their approval.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, who plays cornerback and choreographer, has christened
this move ``the Seahawk Flap.'' For once, the term doesn't describe
a franchise shift, car accident or other legal skirmish.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the symbol of the team,'' Thomas said. ``It's like
something out of the movie `Killer Bees' or `The Birds' _ we're
always swarming.''
</P>
<P>
   Should this signature salute persist, and it has become more
visible with each home victory during the Seahawks' 3-2 start, a
patent or copyright might be in order. At the very least, an
explanation.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawk Flap was created in, of all places, an Oakland hotel
room.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   T.J. Cunningham and Thomas, then special-team members, rookies
and roommates, decided the Seattle team needed something
demonstrative to signify big hits and big plays. In high school and
college, Thomas had danced to celebrate an electric moment but
finally conceded he was a bad dancer. Feet were out, hands were in.
</P>
<P>
   In their hotel room, the two Seahawk players experimented with
different routines. Try this, said Cunningham, a safety no longer
with the team. No, try this, responded Thomas. The Flap was born.
</P>
<P>
   They used it the next day, against the Raiders in a 28-21
victory, with little fanfare. Thomas alone flashed the Flap at
times last season. Again, nobody noticed. A lack of success, for
both the defensive back and his NFL team, had a way of obscuring
cuteness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too many people didn't know what it was,'' Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   This season, that is changing. The Seahawks are not only have
been unbeatable at home so far, but Thomas, a second-round draft
pick who had been previously considered an underachiever, has
flourished.
</P>
<P>
   Fans are following his lead with the Flap. Teammates have jumped
on board.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unreal,'' fellow cornerback Shawn Springs said. ``We're
going to have a whole city doing it. We're going to do commercials.
Fred started it.''
</P>
<P>
   Flap approval appears widespread among the Seahawks. As for
participation, holdouts remain.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it fires up Fred and the crowd likes it, I'm for it,''
linebacker Chad Brown said. ``You probably won't catch Chad doing
it. Me, I'm not one for the dance.''
</P>
<P>
   For Thomas, the Seahawk Flap has been a nice diversion after two
seasons of unwanted attention. He struggled as an apprentice pro
defensive back, drawing much media criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas was taken to task during the most recent preseason for
getting beat deep more than once, hitting a punt returner well
before arrival of the ball and offering a grisly, throat-slitting
gesture.
</P>
<P>
   A month ago, after the final exhibition game against the San
Francisco 49ers, Post-Intelligencer columnist Art Thiel dubbed
Thomas as the ``dumbest Seahawk player,'' and offered up the
following suggestion: ``Time for the NFL to consider SAT scores as
a job qualification.''
</P>
<P>
   The article was hand-delivered by teammates to Thomas, who found
it highly motivating and has played well since. Thomas claims he is
smarter than he appears.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want (Thiel) to know I made 875 on my SAT, and that's well
above the required number,'' he said emphatically.
</P>
<P>
   The throat-slitting gesture, he admits, was indefensible. A
couple of Seahawk club officials were equally unimpressed, and told
him so. Thomas was ordered not to do it again. No arguments from
No. 22. In hindsight, he realized he was promoting violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looked at as role models and kids are watching us,''
Thomas acknowledged. ``I sat back and thought, `It's not a good
thing,' so I don't do it anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   As an alternative, the Seahawk Flap was dusted off and given
another test run.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas always has been a creative sort. Before joining the
Seahawks, he went to four colleges in five years. He played the
1994 season in the Southeastern Conference, for the University of
Mississippi, returning an interception 83 yards for a score against
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   His stint with Ole Miss ended after his arrest on a felony
forgery charge for allegedly writing a check on another person's
account. Rather than accept a five-game suspension as punishment,
he transfered to Division II Tennessee-Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Thomas is a model citizen, father of one, improved NFL
cornerback and inventor of the Seahawk Flap. Regarding the latter,
people have suggested he take a serious look at marketing
possibilities. Already, he is thinking T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's becoming very contagious,'' the defensive back said.
``It's my own little personal thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas is more than happy to discuss his creation. That way, no
copycats will emerge from the NFL's other bird-like teams, the
Eagles, Cardinals and Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   That might cause a Flap flap.
</P>
<P>
   HAWK TALK: The Seahawks lost DT Carl Hansen on Tuesday when the
New York Jets signed him off Seattle's practice squad. Hansen was a
sixth-round draft choice and although he wasn't able to beat out DT
Riddick Parker or DE Mike Croel for a spot on the 53-man roster, he
was signed to the practice squad because of his versatility and
potential. To fill Hansen's spot, the club plans to re-sign DT
Ralph Hughes, who was on the practice squad earlier this season.
... Sunday's game against the Broncos is essentially sold out,
meaning it will be the first home game this season to be shown on
Seattle-area TV and probably the first since 1993 to be sold out
before the Thursday blackout deadline. The last home game to be
shown on local TV was last year's season finale against the 49ers.
But KCPQ-TV guaranteed the sell out. The last game to be sold out
by the Thursday afternoon blackout deadline was against the Chiefs
and Joe Montana on Dec. 5, 1993. Only eight of 34 home games since
then have been televised locally, and in each case a sellout was
guaranteed by a TV station or sponsor.

FOX CALLS AN AUDIBLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Just when USC appears on the cusp of a quarterback
controversy, the Trojans have added another quarterback to the mix.
</P>
<P>
   John Fox, who switched to tight end before the season, moved
back to quarterback Tuesday after telling coach Paul Hackett he
wanted to return to his original position.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's experiment began Aug. 14, the first week of training camp,
but he said that he began having doubts ``the second day'' after he
switched to tight end.
</P>
<P>
   When Fox first moved to tight end, he said, ``I'll never play
quarterback again.'' But Tuesday, he was back as USC's No. 3 signal
caller.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my love. That's really why I came here,'' Fox said of his
move back to quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been concerned about No. 3 (quarterback) all along,''
Hackett said. ``John felt comfortable making the move, so I said
fine. No more tight end.''

   Fox, who started nine games last season, appeared rusty as he
ran the scout team Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``(My goal is) to get better and just be there and prepare for
the spring,'' Fox said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the other two USC quarterbacks, Hackett remained firm
that Mike Van Raaphorst was the starter but said Carson Palmer
might now enter a contest as soon as the second quarter. Hackett
also refused to rule out that Palmer might eventually start.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to preclude that he's not going to start before
the end of the season,'' Hackett said. ``But I'm not going to say
that I expect him to, because I don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Raaphorst said he wasn't bothered by the third-quarter boos
when he came onto the field against Arizona State.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fans are fans,'' he said. ``I guess they think I wasn't
producing. I just have to play.''
</P>
<P>
   The sophomore said it was reassuring that the starting position
is determined by Hackett and not the fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's nice to know the guy in football operations
understands what's going on,'' Van Raaphorst said.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett also had a message for fans who clamor for Palmer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to take a poll on how many years they've coached
quarterbacks,'' Hackett said. ``And then I'd like to put that
against how many years that I've coached quarterbacks, which is
about 29 now, and I would like to tell them to have patience and
trust me.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Morton still questionable: Tailback Chad Morton sat out
practice, and Hackett said he was hopeful the speedy runner would
return today or Thursday. Freshman Frank Strong strained his knee
near the end of practice, but Hackett said it was not serious.
</P>
<P>
   __ Veterans reclaim starting jobs: Hackett said senior
linebacker Mark Cusano and strong safety Grant Pearsall would
probably start Saturday against California. Their replacements _
linebacker Zeke Moreno and strong safety Ife Ohalete _ will
continue to play.

UNSTOPPABLE YANKS CRUSH INDIANS IN ALCS OPENER

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Scoring lots of runs early would be nice, New York
Yankees manager Joe Torre mused before Tuesday night's playoff game
with Cleveland, as if he were considering a room service menu. And
the Yankees delivered.
</P>
<P>
   They pummeled the Indians' best pitcher, Jaret Wright, for five
runs in the first inning and went on to a 7-2 victory in the
opening game of the American League Championship Series. A crowd of
57,138 on a brisk fall evening at Yankee Stadium basked in the glow
of this seemingly unbeatable team, which needs three more victories
in this four-of-seven-game series to reach the World Series for the
second time in three years and the 35th time in franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   Game 2 will be played Wednesday afternoon at the Stadium, with
David Cone pitching for the Yankees and Charles Nagy for the
Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Following a regular season in which they won 114 games, the most
in American League history, the Yankees are doing everything right
in the post-season. They swept Texas in the division series,
limiting the heavy-hitting Rangers to one run in three games, and
Tuesday night they rocked the Indians, with an immediate burst of
offense, consistently superb defense and more great pitching from
David Wells.
</P>
<P>
   Wells, who won 18 games this season, including a perfect game in
May, has allowed only 2 runs in 16 innings this post-season. The
Yankee left-hander had not been scored on in his last 23
post-season innings, dating to last year, before Manny Ramirez
unloaded a two-run home run off Wells in the ninth inning Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians managed only four other hits off Wells, who was
removed after pitching to two batters in the ninth. The Yankees,
who have allowed just 3 runs and 18 hits in 36 innings in the
post-season, have now won 118 games in the regular season and
playoffs combined. That matches the total achieved by only one
other team in baseball history, the 1906 Chicago Cubs, in a
154-game season and a six-game World Series.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, Torre agreed, are playing with great confidence.
Wells arrived at the Stadium on Tuesday afternoon seeming loose and
self-assured, wearing dark sunglasses, high-top basketball
sneakers, blue jeans and a T-shirt. Fans outside the players'
entrance screamed for him, and Wells nodded: No problem.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, he playfully donned a black jersey, with the
name of the heavy metal band Metallica stripped across the front,
and slipped into the dugout, jokingly suggesting that he might wear
this particular uniform on the field. If Wells felt nervous in any
way, he masked his feelings expertly.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe he and the Yankees have come to believe they are going
to win every game. It must have seemed that way to the Indians
right off the bat.
</P>
<P>
   Wright started for Cleveland, having beaten the Yankees twice in
the playoffs last year; this year, he was one of only five pitchers
who beat the Yankees twice in a regular season in which they lost
only 48 of 162 games. But the Yankees dismissed Wright on Tuesday
night as if they were wiping away an annoying insect.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Raines, their designated hitter Tuesday night, said on
Monday that the Yankees wanted to get runners on base and make
Wright throw from the stretch position, rather than have him
deliver from a full windup. ``We just don't think he's as
comfortable with runners on base,'' Raines said.
</P>
<P>
   They tested this theory immediately. Leading off the bottom of
the first, Chuck Knoblauch lined a single over second base, and
Wright had to work from the stretch. Derek Jeter then lined a
single through the middle, Knoblauch stopping at second.
</P>
<P>
   Paul O'Neill battled Wright to a full count _ Wright would throw
36 pitches in the first inning _ and then, with both runners moving
on the 3-2 pitch, O'Neill golfed a single to right, scoring one
run. When Bernie Williams lined a single through the middle, Jeter
raced and Chad Ogea scrambled to start warming up in the Cleveland
bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Four batters into their lineup, the Yankees had a 2-0 lead and
two runners on base.
</P>
<P>
   After a force-play grounder to second by Tino Martinez left
runners at first and third, Martinez stole second on Raines'
strikeout. Now there were two out, and with another out, Wright
would be in good condition if he could get out Shane Spencer. But
he threw a curveball when it appeared the catcher Sandy Alomar was
expecting a fastball and the ball bounced between Alomar's legs for
a wild pitch. O'Neill crossed the plate from third with the
Yankees' third run. Spencer walked.
</P>
<P>
   Everything was going wrong for Wright.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Posada lined a single to right, another run scoring, and
Wright was finished. Because one of Wright's close pitches broke
the left hand of Luis Sojo of the Yankees in spring training, the
Yankees have little regard for Wright, and fans at the Stadium
showed their disdain; as Wright walked off the field, head down,
the crowd roared mockingly, thanking him for his effort.
</P>
<P>
   After Scott Brosius singled off the reliever Chad Ogea, driving
in another run, Wright's line was complete _ two-thirds of an
inning pitched, five hits, five runs, one walk, one strikeout.
</P>
<P>
   Wells, the only Yankee pitcher who acknowledges the personalized
chants from the right-field bleachers when he is on the mound, had
a big lead and used it to his advantage. Usually aggressive anyway,
Wells challenged the Indians with fastballs, some sinking and some
riding high in the strike zone. Omar Vizquel got Cleveland's second
hit of the game in the third inning, and Wells then struck out both
Kenny Lofton and Joey Cora, two batters who have hit him hard in
the past.
</P>
<P>
   Travis Fryman bounced a grounder into the shortstop hole for
what appeared to be a two-out hit in the fourth. But Jeter, the
Yankees' shortstop, speared the ball as he moved toward the
third-base line, jumped and fired across the infield, the throw
beating Fryman to first by the width of a shoelace.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are doing everything right. They added runs in the
sixth and seventh innings, with Posada hitting a home run in the
sixth and O'Neill and Williams belting consecutive doubles in the
seventh.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have acknowledged the inherent pressure in playing
the post-season after their stunning performance in the regular
season; they must win the World Series to assure their legacy, to
be recognized as one of baseball's greatest teams. If they lose in
the post-season, they will be remembered as a great team that never
achieved its goal.
</P>
<P>
   But there is inordinate stress on the Cleveland Indians, as
well. After winning 89 games, 25 fewer than the Yankees, during the
regular season; after seeing the Yankees' pitching dominate the
best-hitting team in the American League in the Division Series,
what is going through the minds of the Indians after the Yankees
knocked out their best pitcher in the first inning?

HOUSE DEMOCRATS UNDER PRESSURE TO VOTE AGAINST BROAD IMPEACHMENT
INQUIRY

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the House prepares to vote Thursday on beginning
an impeachment inquiry, Democratic leaders labored on Tuesday to
keep as many beleaguered Democrats as possible from voting for the
Republican proposal over an inquiry's length and scope.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders and Judiciary Committee members met throughout the day
to weigh the Democratic alternative they plan to offer this week,
and to consider bringing it closer to the Republican version in
hopes of appealing to a large bloc of nervous and angry moderates.
</P>
<P>
   But by the end of a chaotic day, it appeared that they were
leaning against that approach and preferred staying with a proposal
Democrats offered on Monday in the Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever approach they choose, the White House was still bracing
for desertions by anywhere from two dozen to several dozen
Democrats. The greater the level of defection, the harder it will
be to scoff at the vote as a partisan vendetta.
</P>
<P>
   House leaders, more concerned about their colleagues' electoral
success than their president, were seeking a way to enable the rank
and file to say they voted for a reasonable proposal for conducting
an inquiry into the president's behavior, but opposed a Republican
witch hunt.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican plan, adopted on Monday by the Judiciary
Committee along party lines, has no time limit on the inquiry and
does not limit its focus to the possible charges recommended by
Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel, who dealt only
with President Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky and his
efforts to conceal it. Committee Democrats sought to give the
inquiry a Thanksgiving deadline and bar the consideration of
additional issues.
</P>
<P>
   The possible revisions being floated early on Tuesday included
extending the Thanksgiving deadline until the end of December, and
specifically allowing for the consideration of any new information
from the Office of Independent Counsel, Democratic officials said.
</P>
<P>
   For some Democrats, the idea of softening the alternative could
sweeten the pot. ``I'm trying to avoid polarizing this thing as a
political decision,'' said Rep. David Minge of Minnesota. ``I'm
searching for ways to accomplish that.''
</P>
<P>
   But for others the decision to vote for the Republican proposal
is all but a foregone conclusion. ``I'm going to vote for an
inquiry in order to move the process forward,'' said Rep. Chris
John, D-La. ``My district has consistently wanted to move this
along, and this is a way to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John M. Spratt Jr., D-S.C., who is in a tight race for
re-election, said he favored an inquiry, but only one with a
deadline and a limited scope. ``If the Democratic alternative
fails, I've got a tough choice,'' Spratt said. ``I haven't ruled
out the Republican motion.''
</P>
<P>
   All day, Democrats on the Judiciary Committee and Democratic
whips tried to appeal to moderates by cautioning them that a vote
for the Republican proposal would doom the House to a long,
wide-ranging impeachment inquiry. But by evening, they seemed
discouraged.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton,
Vice President Al Gore and lobbyist friends of his like Thomas
Downey placed a new round of phone calls to House Democrats,
including some committee chairmen, to lobby and to gauge the mood.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic officials said they could lose as many as 80
Democrats or as few as two dozen on the vote on the Republican
proposal. For their part, Republicans have said that as many as 100
Democrats could vote with them. But some on each side are playing
the expectations game, hoping to argue once the votes are cast that
they did better than expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``This vote is coming awfully close to an election and a lot of
people are factoring that in,'' a White House official said.
``There will be a significant amount of people who will vote, not
based on how they feel, but on how they expect it to impact in
November.''
</P>
<P>
   Further complicating matters for the White House and its allies,
Rep. Dick Armey of Texas, the majority leader, said on Tuesday that
Democrats would not be allowed to offer their proposal as a
clear-cut substitute to the open-ended Republican proposal.
Instead, Democrats will have to bring up their proposal under a
parliamentary maneuver in which debate is limited to one hour.
</P>
<P>
   And Armey again raised the possibility that the inquiry's scope,
under the direction of the Judiciary Committee chairman, Henry Hyde
of Illinois, could broaden to include accusations and evidence from
other investigations.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the Committee on Government Reform and Oversight,
whose chairman is Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., is expected to vote to
release its interim report on 1996 Democratic campaign finance
abuses. A Republican aide with the committee said that there were
no impeachable offenses in the findings, but that at least one
chapter of the report contained information ``salient'' to the
Judiciary Committee's inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   The information deals mostly with ``White House stonewalling and
the abuse of executive privilege,'' the aide said. An estimated 80
witnesses took the Fifth Amendment or fled the country in order not
to testify before the panel, the aide said.
</P>
<P>
   Armey said on Tuesday: ``Let me remind you again, one of the
patterns that we see, that I certainly see is stonewall,
evasiveness, obstruction. So I mean these things will be pursued by
the committee.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Democratic leaders listened as member after member
expressed a sense of nervousness about the November elections and
anger toward Clinton, Democratic officials said. But by the end of
the day, the leaders had not decided on a course of action to bring
members together, torn in part between angering their traditional
liberal base and upsetting moderates who face tough re-election
bids. They will caucus Wednesday morning to discuss the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Some liberals complained that the president was worrying too
much about himself and not enough about the elections. And a few
said they were tempted to vote against any resolution that opened
the door to an impeachment investigation. That includes a
Democratic alternative.
</P>
<P>
   ``Voting against Hyde is easy,'' said Rep. Charles Rangel of New
York, who opposes any impeachment inquiry. ``The Democratic
alternative, that's the problem. There's no alternative for those
of us who say the evidence does not rise to the level of an
inquiry.''
</P>
<P>
   Many New Democrats, who traditionally align themselves with
Clinton on policy matters, said they were not pleased about the
pressure they were getting from the White House. And moderates in
swing districts, who must answer to a large number of Republican
constituents, continued to express outrage about the president's
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``The motion for an inquiry is a very proper motion,'' said Rep.
Charles Stenholm, D-Texas, stating his intention to vote for the
Republican resolution. ``I want the process to move as quickly and
expeditiously as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   While Democratic leaders stressed that ultimately members must
vote their conscience, Judiciary Committee members lobbied their
fence-sitting colleagues in the hopes of bringing them around.
</P>
<P>
   ``With an open-ended resolution, the only thing needed to keep
it going would be for someone to mail in new allegations,'' said
Rep. Robert Scott, a Virginia Democrat on the committee.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, several senior Democrats voiced skepticism that
Republicans would hold fair impeachment hearings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm fairly convinced that House, as presently led, couldn't
conduct a fair trial on a parking ticket,'' said Rep. David Obey of
Wisconsin.

 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
Instead of convening for training camp Tuesday, a number of NBA
players appeared at Westside Tennis Club in a show of solidarity
with their union, which is involved in an increasingly bitter labor
dispute with team owners.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Among those in attendance were the Rockets' Hakeem Olajuwon,
Mario Elie, Othella Harrington, Brent Price and Joe Stephens; New
Jersey's Sam Cassell; Denver's Nick Van Exel; San Antonio's Avery
Johnson; Boston's Ron Mercer; Cleveland's Derek Anderson; Golden
State's Clarence Weatherspoon; and Phoenix's Mark Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   Because the owners have imposed a lockout, the players who
should have been preparing for the 1998-99 season instead got
together to hold a series of pickup games, sign autographs and
address the assembled media about the state of discussions between
the union and the owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's bad,'' said Price of the most recent proposal, of which
the Chronicle obtained a copy. ``It's very discouraging.''
</P>
<P>
   Players who discussed the matter Tuesday were unhappy with
several key points in the owners' latest proposal, among them:
</P>
<P>
   The gradual elimination of the Larry Bird exception, which
allows teams to re-sign their own free agents for any amount
regardless of the salary cap, which is the No. 1 issue in the
debate. According to the owners' proposal, the Bird exception would
be phased out over a period of three years, with a decreasing rate
of payment to those Bird-eligible players over that three-year
span, creating a hard salary cap at the end.
</P>
<P>
   An alternative plan would keep the Bird exception on the
condition that should salaries rise above 54 percent of
basketball-related income, players would pay the difference back
into an escrow account that would be jointly funded by the NBA and
the players. Should the salaries fall below that first-year number
of 54 percent, the difference would be paid out of the account.
That percentage would drop to 52 percent in the second year and 50
percent in the third year.
</P>
<P>
   Individual player salaries would be tied to a percentage of the
salary cap. Specifically, no new salary could exceed 30 percent of
the salary cap at the time the contract is signed or, if the player
were already making more than 30 percent of the cap, 105 percent of
the player's previous salary.
</P>
<P>
   The league office would provide teams with the amount offered to
free agents by other teams. The union thinks this provision would
severely curtail free agents' bargaining power.
</P>
<P>
   Possible elimination of the $1 million salary-cap exception.
</P>
<P>
   A period of offseason training under team supervision would be
required.
</P>
<P>
   The current three-year rookie salary scale would be lengthened
by one year for each year a player is under age 20 when drafted.
For example, if an 18-year-old high school player is drafted in the
first round, he would be bound to the team that owns his rights for
five years. In addition, teams would have an option for an
additional two years at the end of any rookie-scale contract.
</P>
<P>
   Most player contracts would be limited to five years, including
an option year.
</P>
<P>
   Performance bonuses would be limited to 5 percent of a player's
salary. That would eliminate a contract like the one Dennis Rodman
signed with the Bulls last season, where he had a salary of $4.5
million but earned almost $6 million in bonuses based on
performance and behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Union president Billy Hunter flew in last week to go over the
latest proposal with the Houston-area players, and few were happy
after the briefing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The proposal we received last week upset a lot of players,''
said former Rocket Purvis Short, now director of player programs
for the players association. ``The players were very unhappy with
the demands that were made. The league is basically asking for a
lot of concessions by the players _ a lot of unreasonable
concessions.''
</P>
<P>
   Concessions the players are unwilling to make.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides are awaiting the result of an arbitration hearing
that will decide whether owners are obligated to pay about 220
guaranteed contracts while the lockout is in effect, a ruling that
should come no later than Oct. 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``The proposal, if you guys (the media) could see a copy of it,
was really not a proposal,'' said Johnson, a former Rocket who
lives in the Houston area. ``I think the situation is getting
worse. It's like anything _ you have so much pride and so many egos
involved that maybe one side is not doing what's best for the game
of basketball. When they send us a proposal (like the one) they
sent us last time, that's not even negotiating.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what we're disappointed about. We're trying to address
all of their (the owners') needs (like) salaries outpacing
revenues. We're trying to address those issues and come up with
creative ways to get them comfortable, but they don't even want to
talk about it unless it's a hard cap.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that the exhibition season has been canceled and training
camps have been delayed indefinitely, some players are bound to
start getting antsy about what lies ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last proposal we got was worse than the first one,'' Elie
said. ``I don't blame the players association for rejecting it. But
I do think that both sides just have to meet each other halfway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm real disappointed. Hopefully, something can get resolved
soon. There's a big (arbitration) ruling next week, so we're just
keeping our fingers crossed that both sides can agree on
something.''
</P>
<P>
   Olajuwon agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the beginning, I didn't think it was going to be this
serious,'' he said. ``But now it's getting so big that I think both
parties need to sit down like gentlemen so they can compromise and
work things out. That's the only way I think people resolve
problems, by sitting down and working it out.''
</P>
<P>
   But time is running out.
</P>
<P>
   Many players are beginning to wonder if there is a point of no
return at which the regular season has to be wiped away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the real deadline (for reaching an agreement) was
Oct. 1, and that's over,'' Johnson said. ``Now, the real deadline
is Nov. 3 or 4, when the regular season was supposed to start. I
don't really want to play an abbreviated season, (playing only) 60
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we have to get a deal done and (NBA commissioner) David
Stern and his people have to be more open to our creative ways of
addressing their problems.''

 &HT;    Mighty, mighty Yanks impressive in ALCS Game 1
 &HT;    By Hal McCoy
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Writing an obituary for the Cleveland Indians this
morning wouldn't be prudent, despite a tempting inclination to do
just that after watching the New York Yankees perpetrate something
close to aggravated manslaughter in front of millions of TV
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The Mighty, Mighty Yankees not only won their 118th game this
season, tying the all-time one-season record, they put an
exclamation point behind it when their first four hitters singled
against precocious Indians starter Jaret Wright and sent him
seeking the shampoo and soap in the shower before TV showed its
first commercial.
</P>
<P>
   When Game 1 of the 1998 American League Championship Series
ended, it was New York 7, Cleveland 2.
</P>
<P>
   If you listen to the Indians, they have the Yankees right where
they want them _ the Indians with their backs plastered firmly
against the Yankee Stadium wall.
</P>
<P>
   The defeat Tuesday was Cleveland's eighth straight in the first
game of a postseason series, dating back to 1995. And in four of
those previous seven, the Tribe came back to win the series.
</P>
<P>
   And now they have to do it again.
</P>
<P>
   There was no Escape From New York for Wright. The Yankees were
peeking around a building from a back alley waiting on this guy.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't like the 22-year-old's perceived cockiness after he
beat them twice in last year's Division Series, after he put
together a 4-1 career record against them and especially after he
broke infielder Luis Sojo's left wrist with a spring training pitch
which they feel was intentional.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was the night in June when he hit former
Cincinnati outfielder Paul O'Neill and when O'Neill expressed
displeasure, Wright motioned for O'Neill to shut his mouth and walk
to first base.
</P>
<P>
   Wright's night Tuesday consisted of eight hitters and the
Yankees pecked him to oblivion with five singles and a walk en
route to five runs. The first four Yankees singled _ Chuck
Knoblauch, Derek Jeter, O'Neill (for a retribution run) and Bernie
Williams (for another run).
</P>
<P>
   By the time the first inning ended, Chad Ogea was pitching, the
Yankees had a 5-0 lead and had batted around (10 hitters). Nothing
new there. The Yankees batted around an unfathomable 36 times
during the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   When Wright walked off the mound, with the Beatles' Help
accompanying his long walk to the dugout, the 57,138 fans booed
heartily.
</P>
<P>
   Five runs in the first inning was more than David ``Boomer''
Wells needed. With his baggy uniform making him look a guy wearing
pajamas after an all-night party, Wells put the Tribe to sleep with
no harm done _ two runs on Manny Ramirez's two-run homer run in the
ninth, five hits, one walk, one hit batsman, seven strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   Wells not only marches to the beat of a different drummer, he is
the drummer. His back is covered with tattoos, he wears his
baseball shirt unbuttoned nearly to his navel, he wanted to wear
Babe Ruth's retired No. 3 when he came to the Yankees and teammate
Tino Martinez said, ``Our pitches come from all over. We have a
pitcher from Cuba, a pitcher from Japan, a pitcher from Panama and
we have Boomer Wells, who is from Mars.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, this 35-year-old Martian was 18-4 for the Yankees this
season, shut out the Texas Rangers, 2-0 on five hits over eight
innings in Game 1 of the Division Series and shut down the Indians
without a run for eighth innings on in Game 1 of the ALCS.
</P>
<P>
   And, indeed, in the postseason he is out of this world _ 6-1 as
a starter with a 2.48 earned-run average.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati fans remember Wells from the 1995 season when he
helped pitch the Reds to the National League Championship Series
against Atlanta _ then was traded after the season to Baltimore for
outfielders Curtis Goodwin and Travis Valdez _ a deal almost as bad
as the one that sent O'Neill from the Reds to the Yankees after the
1992 season for Roberto Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill, who completed his sixth straight season of hitting .300
or higher for the Yankees, had two hits, drove in a run and scored
two.

UCLA WILL BE SANS LEWIS AT ARIZONA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Third-ranked UCLA will face No. 10 Arizona on
Saturday without starting tailback Jermaine Lewis, who has been
suspended indefinitely for his involvement in a weekend fight.
</P>
<P>
   A Lancaster native, Lewis was not seriously hurt. He has not
been arrested and told coach Bob Toledo it wasn't his fault. But he
was identified in a campus police report, prompting the suspension
on Tuesday. It will remain in effect until the investigation is
complete.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a police report, and when it gets to that point,
there's a suspension,'' Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jermaine cried (upon being told about the suspension), and he
felt bad. He's sorry and, supposedly, it wasn't his fault. But I
don't want guys in positions where they get in fights. If it
starts, you have to walk away.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Toledo suspended starting nose guard Damon Smith for
fighting several days before the USC game. Smith missed that game
and did not start the Cotton Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   A sophomore, Lewis is UCLA's top rusher at 90 yards per game,
and he leads the Pacific-10 in scoring with eight touchdowns.
Junior Keith Brown will start at Arizona _ where the Bruins have
not won in 10 years _ with true freshman DeShaun Foster moving to
second string and walk-on Mark Reynosa to third.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a whole different game now,'' Foster said.
</P>
<P>
   According to campus police, the incident occurred at
approximately 1:30 a.m. Sunday at 525{ Landfair, near fraternity
row. The police report was filed Monday afternoon and the case will
go to detectives this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, at this point, it's somebody filing a report and
we're investigating it,'' said Nancy Greenstein, a spokesperson for
campus police.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo said the male, who is not a UCLA student, needed several
stitches. Several UCLA players broke up the fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``The players claim it ended real fast,'' Toledo said. ``Then
all of a sudden on Monday there's a police report. The guy didn't
do anything Sunday. But you can't continue to fight. You have to
walk away.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins treated Lewis' suspension with a mix of sadness and
steadfastness. For perspective, Toledo told them about a similar
situation in 1995, when UCLA defeated USC without star tailback
Karim Abdul-Jabbar.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just going to treat this like an injury,'' said
offensive tackle Kris Farris. ``We've been in a lot of big games
without good players.''
</P>
<P>
   Foster and Brown have combined for 188 yards this season _ 82
fewer than Lewis _ but each played his best game of the season
Saturday against Washington State. Brown rushed for two touchdowns;
Foster gained 77 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a starter and DeShaun's not a starter, and there's
concern about whether we can get the job done,'' said Brown, a
Phoenix native. ``Of course, I think we can.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of weight on me. As soon as I heard (about the
suspension), I felt a little pressure. But it's my opportunity to
show what I can do. You live for situations like this. I can't wait
to get on the field and show my thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Foster credited his playing time for reducing the pressure. In
addition to 25 carries this season, he has returned six punts and
five kickoffs in place of the injured Freddie Mitchell. A few words
of encouragement from Foster's offensive line Tuesday didn't hurt,
either.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had just gotten reps here and there, I'd probably be
nervous,'' he said. ``But I feel comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   If anything, Tuesday's practice was more spirited than usual. It
culminated with Foster scoring a touchdown and getting mobbed by
his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``This doesn't change things too much,'' said quarterback Cade
McNown. ``We've got three tailbacks. You like to have all the
weapons you can. But Keith and DeShaun are guys that have both
proven themselves.''

for the first time since the AT&AMP;T Corp. was founded in 1885, the
company introduced a brand that does not mention AT&AMP;T: the Lucky
Dog Phone Co. Television advertisements for the ``new'' company
began running on Tuesday in 18 big markets, including New York and
Los Angeles. Just as the advertisements for Red Dog beer do not

riso alla valenziana every single time he comes. Never mind that it

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In lightning-like fashion, the New York Yankees
deflated all of the talk and answered all of the questions.
</P>
<P>
   How would they fare against Jaret Wright, who beat them twice
last October? Who had the greater incentive to win this American
League Championship Series, they or the Cleveland Indians? Would
the hitters at the top of the Yankees' lineup wake up or slumber
their way through the post-season? Could the Yankees' pitchers
continue the dominating performances that left the league's other
best-hitting team wondering who put those holes in their bats?
</P>
<P>
   With an awesome array of first-inning singles and another
head-shaking effort by David Wells, the Yankees dispatched the
Indians, 7-2, Tuesday night and took a commanding one-game lead in
the prelude to the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Commanding lead? After the first game in a four-of-seven-game
series? Given the developments at Yankee Stadium, that assessment
might not be premature.
</P>
<P>
   The significance of the first-inning eruption cannot be
emphasized too strongly. The Yankees' hitters did not win the
division series against the Texas Rangers. Sure, they produced
enough runs to win the three games, but if the pitchers had allowed
the Rangers to hit as they did all season, nine runs would not have
been sufficient.
</P>
<P>
   A similar hitting effort might place too much responsibility on
the Yankee pitchers, even though pitching had really been the
team's strength most of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to pitch,'' manager Joe Torre had said before the game
when he was asked what his concerns were approaching the series.
``When we have pitched well during the course of the year, we have
won or at least had been there to win.''
</P>
<P>
   But in this game, before the Yankees knew for sure that Wells
would pitch brilliantly again, the hitters did their part. Not that
Wells wouldn't have pitched the same game with the same success,
but the first-inning breakout made his job easier. With the
exception of some closers, pitchers would much rather pitch with a
big early lead. That's what the Yankees gave their starting pitcher
for the first time in this post-season.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Knoblauch, who batted .091 in the Texas series, led off
the first inning by lining a single to right field. Derek Jeter,
who batted .111, lined a single to center. Paul O'Neill lined a
single to right, driving in the first run. Bernie Williams, who
didn't get a hit in 11 at-bats against the Rangers, lined a single
to center, and the Yankees had two runs against Wright, who beat
them in the second and fifth games of last year's five-game
division series.
</P>
<P>
   Wright was also one of only five pitchers who gained two
victories against the 114-48 Yankees this season. Had the Yankees
allowed him to continue his mastery over them, the series could
have taken on a tone they hadn't anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   But they turned out to be right and Wright wrong. After throwing
only 36 pitches, hardly enough to develop a sweat on a 51-degree
night, and getting only two outs, Wright was gone, having
registered the briefest outing for a starting pitcher in a league
series game in 22 years.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1976 playoff series between the Yankees and the Kansas
City Royals, Dennis Leonard left the fifth and decisive game after
facing the first three batters in the Yankees' lineup and retiring
none of them. If that game sounds distantly familiar, it was the
one that Chris Chambliss won with a ninth-inning home run,
catapulting the Yankees into their first World Series since 1964.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of the explosion against Wright and the Indians'
inability to hit Wells indicated that the Yankees' progression to
the next step this year won't be as dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   Wells, who triggered the sweep of the Rangers by pitching eight
shutout innings, extended his post-season shutout string to 23
consecutive innings before Manny Ramirez hit a two-run home run in
the ninth inning. Until the home run, the Yankees' starters had a
1998 post-season record of one run allowed in 28 2/3 innings and
the pitching staff over-all a record of one run in 35 innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' staff, in other words, had a post-season earned run
average of 0.26. Earned run averages don't get much more minuscule
than that.
</P>
<P>
   In holding the Rangers practically scoreless, the Yankees became
the first team to allow only one run in any of the 169 post-season
series that have been played. They can't duplicate that feat in
this series, but Wells sure made a good beginning.
</P>
<P>
   The left-hander, who had produced one of the most eye-opening,
seasonlong performances of 1998, added to his post-season luster by
allowing the Indians only three hits, all harmless singles, until
the ninth. Between the second and third singles, he set down 11
batters in order.
</P>
<P>
   Only once did the Indians put two runners on base in the same
inning, and then the irrepressible left-hander ended it with a
flourish, striking out Richie Sexson.
</P>
<P>
   If this series should continue as the first one did after Wells
foiled the Rangers, Wells may not get to pitch again until the
World Series.
</P>
<P>
   But then, the Yankees can't be too premature in their plans.
Maybe they should wait until they play Wednesday's second game.

Y2K COMPUTER PROBLEM A CAMPAIGN ISSUE IN CONNECTICUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ Candidates who thought they had their fall rap
down pat _ smaller class sizes (good), health insurers (bad), new
taxes (really bad) _ suddenly find themselves fielding a new issue:
the millennium bug.
</P>
<P>
   The year 2000 problem, popularly known as Y2K, has programmers
hustling to rework computers that recognize years by their last two
digits, so that '00 means 1900 and possible mayhem when 2000
arrives. Now the bug is being used by challengers for offices
around the country to suggest that incumbents are too slow to
defuse a time bomb that could result in late checks, or worse.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the high yawn factor, one problem with the year 2000
problem as a campaign issue is that it will not be a problem for a
while. But that does not stop candidates from trying to capitalize
on it.
</P>
<P>
   In Connecticut, state Rep. Christopher Scalzo, the Republican
candidate for comptroller, has been offering himself as ``a fighter
for working families,'' and his main issue has been the handling of
payments for the state employees' health insurance by Democratic
incumbent Nancy Wyman.
</P>
<P>
   This is the typical fare of a down-ballot campaign. Wednesday,
though, Scalzo plans to enliven the comptroller's race by holding a
news conference to assail Mrs. Wyman's efforts to get her office
ready for the millennium _ ``Y2K compliant,'' as the computer
experts say _ and to help city and town officials with their own
conversions.
</P>
<P>
   Scalzo says that at the press conference he will release a
consultant's report indicating that Mrs. Wyman's office has not
finished updating and testing its computers. ``Either Nancy Wyman
doesn't know what's going on in her office, or she doesn't
understand what's going on in her office,'' he said Tuesday,
limbering up his millennial sound bites.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Wyman said in response that she had never claimed that the
job was finished. ``We're up and running with two of our three core
financial systems,'' she said. ``The third one will be complete in
the early part of 1999.''
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Faucheux, the editor in chief of Campaigns and Elections
magazine, said the year 2000 problem has been brought up in several
statewide races this year, mostly by candidates who say they will
do their best to fix it. Their opponents usually agree that is a
good idea, and so it has not been an issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not something people are going to draw blood on this
year,'' Faucheux said. ``This will be an issue in 2000 or 2002 if
something goes wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   In Connecticut, though, Mrs. Wyman has been discussing the topic
for months and promising that when 2000 comes, the state will be
able to send out checks on time. She had been considered a safe bet
for re-election, but her campaign workers have become nervous as
polls showed the top of the Democratic ticket, U.S. Rep. Barbara
Kennelly, flailing in her campaign for governor.
</P>
<P>
   In August, Mrs. Wyman announced that by using her own staff, she
would be able to convert her office's computers for $750,000
instead of the $6 million that one consultant had demanded. In
September, she announced she was creating a ``Year 2000 municipal
help desk'' and a Web site for local governments.
</P>
<P>
   ``My agency could not keep our valuable year 2000 knowledge and
experience to ourselves,'' she said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   That was more fodder for Scalzo, 34, a former currency broker
who lives in Fairfield County. ``She's throwing the gasoline of
political rhetoric on the fire of Y2K,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Wyman, 52, said that she should receive credit for her
foresight in solving a problem that still perplexes many
businesses. ``It's an issue, and a proud issue,'' she said.

L.A. MAYOR JOINS CAMPAIGN TO WOO NFL BACK TO TOWN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICK ORLOV and PATRICK McGREEVY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Ratcheting up competition between two groups to
bring professional football to Los Angeles, Mayor Richard Riordan
said he will ask the NFL to support the L.A. Memorial Coliseum as a
venue.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan's announcement further solidifies the factions in the
battle to win a National Football League expansion team for the Los
Angeles area. Former superagent Michael Ovitz is proposing a new
team and stadium for the city of Carson, an L.A. suburb.
</P>
<P>
   When the NFL owners meet in Kansas City on Oct. 27, Riordan and
Ovitz will be there to pitch their plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will tell them that government is 100 percent behind the
Coliseum,'' Riordan said. ``The state, the city, the county, the
Coliseum Commission will work together to make it work.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, the best venue for the NFL in this city is the
Coliseum.''
</P>
<P>
   NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said Houston also will be vying for a
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to hear from the two groups in Los Angeles and
the Houston team,'' Aiello said. ``We want the owners to hear
firsthand what's going on in these two cities as we look to a 32nd
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Riordan plans to meet today with developers who formed the New
Coliseum Partners to review their proposal and how he can help. The
group is headed by developers Philip Anschutz and Edward Roski Jr.,
who own the Los Angeles Kings hockey team. They also developed the
downtown Staples Center sports arena, where the professional
basketball Los Angeles Lakers and Clippers teams and the Kings will
begin play next year.
</P>
<P>
   They are competing against a proposal by Ovitz and a team of
sports celebrities including Jerry West, Magic Johnson and
Shaquille O'Neal who want to build a stadium and bring a team to
the Carson site.
</P>
<P>
   For the meeting, Ovitz is preparing a high-power, dramatic
presentation of his proposal for a new facility in Carson. He plans
a Spanish-style structure with mission bells clanging every time a
touchdown is scored.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's announcement comes at a key time for Roski, Anschutz
and the New Coliseum Partners project as they also prepare for the
NFL owners meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas said a decision by Riordan to back
the Coliseum plan could be crucial.
</P>
<P>
   ``His support is telling the NFL that the man elected by all the
people wants this at the Coliseum and lends a great deal of
credibility,'' Ridley-Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   John Semcken of the New Coliseum Partners group said the mayor's
endorsement is valuable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we've answered every question that has been raised to
us,'' Semcken said. ``We want to have the mayor come out and tell
the owners he wants to bring professional football back to Los
Angeles with us.''
</P>
<P>
   NFL owners comparing the viability of the different competing
ownership teams are leery of the strength of the Coliseum team
headed by Roski, said a source who has spoken to the owners.
</P>
<P>
   Because of his background in politics and business, Riordan has
a wide network of contacts that he said could help shore up the
Coliseum plan. Until now, the mayor has not taken a high-profile
role in promoting the Coliseum as a football venue, although he has
long supported the effort.
</P>
<P>
   Sports management consultant David Carter said Riordan might
have to answer questions about why he has been so silent.
</P>
<P>
   ``But even so, with the meetings coming up, his support is
important,'' Carter said. ``He can say that (they) wanted to be a
little more deliberative and, as a businessman, make sure
everything is there. And with local politics being the way it is,
he might not have wanted to get involved early on.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the NFL awarded an expansion franchise to
Cleveland, but that leaves the league with an odd number of teams
and with scheduling problems.

YANKS WHO LAGGED EARLIER NOW COME OUT SLUGGING 
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Paul O'Neill listened to one question about why there
had been such a paucity of production from the first five Yankees
in the lineup, and then another and another. Finally, O'Neill
raised his hands in protest and posed a question of his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't get what the big story is about our lineup,'' O'Neill
said. ``We won, didn't we?''
</P>
<P>
   The scene took place after Monday's workout, and O'Neill was
correct: the New York Yankees had won three straight games over the
Texas Rangers. But the type of answer that O'Neill really wanted to
supply came Tuesday night in the first inning, as the first five
Yankees all reached base, with four of them scoring during a
five-run effort. It was a major reason why David Wells and the
Yankees sprinted to a 7-2 victory over Cleveland in Game 1 of the
American League Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees who had been invisible against the Rangers were back
for one nifty inning and beyond Tuesday night. Chuck Knoblauch, who
had gone 1 for 11 in the division series, poked a single to right
field to start the game. Derek Jeter who went 1 for 9 against
Texas, did not wilt after falling behind in the count, 0-2, and
lined a single to center.
</P>
<P>
   Wright had barely dug a hole in front of the rubber, and already
he was sweating.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill, the ornery respondent, had actually been a respectable
4 for 11 in the first round, and he gave the Yankees a 1-0 lead
Tuesday night by stroking a single to right. Bernie Williams, who
had spent the three games against Texas looking lost, going hitless
in 11 at bats, followed O'Neill in search of one measly hit.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Joe Torre had intimated that Williams might be placing
too much pressure on himself because the post-season can be so
fatal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's anything other than being in a short series
and wanting to win,'' Torre said. ``It's not like during the season
when you have a couple of hitless games and you can come back
because you have 160 games left. It takes a lot to tell yourself
not to put too much emphasis on each at-bat.''
</P>
<P>
   But Williams' first time at-bat Tuesday night was very
important, because he belted a single to center to lose the .000
average and put the Yankees ahead, 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   The hit was probably the most important of the night for the
Yankees, because Williams had been 6 for his Tuesday 52 in the
post-season, and the Yankees need him to contribute more than that.
Williams continued to unwind later, combined with O'Neill on
back-to-back doubles in the seventh inning.
</P>
<P>
   When asked beforehand whether he would alter anything for
Tuesday night's game, Williams had sounded like a seventh-grader
who had been told his science project was awful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't know what to change,'' he said. ``I have the same
swing I've had all year.''
</P>
<P>
   It worked. Even though Tino Martinez, who was 3 for 11 against
the Rangers, followed Williams' first-inning hit with a tapper to
second for a fielder's choice, it was a fresh beginning for the
first five players in the batting order. They were fabulous once
more, at least for one inning. Jorge Posada and Scott Brosius added
run-scoring singles, and another run scored on a wild pitch to give
the Yankees and their quintet a 5-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to see us get out early and get some production from
the top half,'' Torre had said. ``Just to get everyone
comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Immediately, everyone was comfortable. Maybe even Williams. For
many Yankee fans, the lasting image of the 1997 division series is
not O'Neill's scorched double off the right-center-field fence in
the ninth inning of the final game. It is of Jose Mesa's next
pitch, the pitch Williams flicked to left for the final out of the
game. There was scant time to rejoice in O'Neill's hit, because
Williams did not deliver the tying run, and the stunned Yankees
were sent home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know one thing, that last year Bernie was very disappointed
when he made the last out,'' Torre said. ``Let's admit it, the year
before, everything Bernie made contact with was a homer or a hit.''
</P>
<P>
   But Williams said: ``Last year is last year. This is a new year.
There are two teams that are both different.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was impossible to ignore the obvious. Williams was in
such a depression after making the final out against the Indians
last year that Torre called him in Puerto Rico and spoke to him in
the soothing, simplistic way that explains why he is the perfect
manager for this often perfect team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just told him he can't expect to get a hit every time up,''
Torre said. ``He had to let it go.''
</P>
<P>
   Has Williams let the recent post-season trouble vanish? Maybe on
Tuesday night did it for him. The center fielder who could be
playing his final three weeks with the Yankees finally had some
hits and some relief. Just like the rest of the teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I've been pressing,'' Williams had said before
the game. ``It's kind of tough to answer that right now, but I
don't think so.''

ARIZONA FANS HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN POLI-DIXON
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Brian Poli-Dixon does not expect a warm welcome
Saturday night in his hometown. In fact, reaction might be
downright hostile for the Tucson native, who starts at split end
for UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a college town and the whole town gets behind the team,''
Poli-Dixon said. ``This game is a big milestone for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Poli-Dixon, who attended Sabino High, is one of three Bruins
with Arizona ties. Freshman guard Mike Saffer, another Sabino grad,
is sitting out this season as a redshirt. He won't travel because
of the 60-man limit for conference games. Asked if he'll go on his
own, Saffer quipped: ``Too hot for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Tailback Keith Brown, who will start in place of suspended
Jermaine Lewis, attended Mountain Pointe High in Phoenix. His
brother, Curtis, attended Arizona, and Brown estimates he'll have
45-50 friends and family members in attendance.
</P>
<P>
   Poli-Dixon's departure might have stung Tucson most, since the
Wildcats have long lacked elite receivers. He considered Arizona,
even took an official recruiting visit, but eventually passed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good school, a good team, and it's home,'' he said.
``But at the same time I wanted to get away from Tucson, get out of
the state.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Ring the Bell: Cornerback Chris McAlister gets the accolades,
but linebacker Marcus Bell could be Arizona's best defensive
player. Certainly, he joins Rob Waldrop and Joe Salave'a on the
list of lightly recruited players who have blossomed under Wildcats
coach Dick Tomey.
</P>
<P>
   Bell played football and wrestled at tiny St. Johns (Ariz.)
High, and he never lost a competition. He was recruited by Arizona,
Northern Arizona and Brigham Young. After two years as a reserve,
he leads the Pac-10 with 11.6 tackles per game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's what's wrong with (recruiting services),'' Tomey said.
``He's just a great player.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Falling in place?: A close examination of UCLA's schedule
reveals several examples of potentially beneficial timing for the
Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   They play Arizona just a week after the Wildcats' emotional win
at Washington.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 17 the Bruins play Oregon, one week after the Ducks
visit Washington State.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 24 they play Cal, a week after the Bears visit Husky
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   They play Stanford a week after it faces Arizona State in Tempe.
</P>
<P>
   And they play Washington a week after the Huskies visit Oregon,
perhaps the fiercest rivalry in the league.
</P>
<P>
   __ Schedule update: Kickoff for the Oct. 17 UCLA-Oregon game at
the Rose Bowl is 12:30 p.m. It will be televised by ABC. Kickoff
for the Oct. 24 game at Cal probably will be announced Monday.

YANKEES DELIVER KNOCKOUT PUNCH IN FIRST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Our forebears likened rooting for the Yankees to
rooting for US Steel.
</P>
<P>
   How now, at the end of the millennium, to express that sentiment
in a way our progeny will understand?
</P>
<P>
   Rooting for Microsoft? For the IRS? Or, as Pedro Martinez in a
Yoda mask might say, for the Dark Side?
</P>
<P>
   Suffice to say, the Yankees were at their invincible best in
beating the Cleveland Indians, 7-2, Tuesday night in Game 1 of the
American League Championship Series, a truly frightening spectacle,
given their track record of laying waste to everything in their
path this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees scored five runs in the first inning, then added a
sixth-inning home run by Jorge Posada and back-to-back doubles by
Paul O'Neill and Bernie Williams in the seventh to build a 7-0 lead
for lefthander David Wells, the tattooed perfectionist who did not
allow an Indian to reach third base until Manny Ramirez's
upper-deck home run with a man aboard in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   ``David Wells did not miss a spot until the ninth inning,'' said
Indians manager Mike Hargrove, who was left in an untenable spot
when his starter, the 22-year-old Wright, missed precious few
Yankee bats while lasting just two-thirds of an inning.
</P>
<P>
   That was rough treatment for a kid who last season beat the
Yankees twice in the postseason, beat them again twice this season,
and had made himself something of a marked man here because of
charges of headhunting after he broke Yankee infielder Luis Sojo's
hand with a pitch in spring training.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message to the fans was, heh-heh, unbelievable,'' Wells
said. ``They deserved that. They're such dedicated fans, they hold
grudges more than we do. To see Jaret go out in the first inning
was _ I don't know how to say this; I don't want to say this _ very
gratifying.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells, who had permitted just four singles before Ramirez
connected, struck out seven, walked one, and set down 11 in a row
between Omar Vizquel's single with one out in the third and David
Justice's single to open the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Nelson replaced Wells after Ramirez's 12th postseason home
run and got the final two outs, his game-ending strikeout of Jim
Thome the cue for dozens of police officers in helmets to come
sprinting onto the field, followed shortly by more than a dozen
cops on horseback.
</P>
<P>
   Such a show of force typically occurs only when there is a
championship clinching in the offing. Maybe this was a dress
rehearsal for a celebration to come, or perhaps that unabashed
Yankee booster, Mayor Rudy Giuliani, was expecting the Indians to
call it a series after just one game.
</P>
<P>
   Given what lies ahead, perhaps they should. Wells is to be
followed this afternoon by 20-game winner David Cone, then
lefthander Andy Pettitte, who has won more games (55) in the last
three years than any other pitcher in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most teams only have one No. 1,'' Hargrove said. ``The Yankees
are a little more blessed than others.''
</P>
<P>
   The Indians have now lost the first game in their last eight
postseason series, including last week's Division Series against
the Red Sox, and while they came back to prevail against the Sox,
to do the same against the Yankees stretches credulity.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have now won a season-high 11 in a row and have
allowed just three runs in four postseason games.
</P>
<P>
   They might be talking about winning their third straight World
Series, Cone said, if the Indians hadn't bounced them in the
Division Series a year ago. The Yankees were five outs away from
eliminating Cleveland in Game 4, only to have Sandy Alomar hit a
series-turning home run off Mariano Rivera.
</P>
<P>
   But manager Joe Torre shredded the notion that the Yankees were
under any extra pressure to exact revenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always have pressure,'' Torre said before the game. ``Any
time you wear pinstripes, you start spring training expecting to go
to the World Series.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the pull of history should be greater than settling an
old score for the Yankees, who have matched the 1906 Cubs for most
wins by any team in a season, playoffs included. The Cubs won 116
games in the regular season, then two more in a World Series they
lost to the crosstown White Sox.
</P>
<P>
   For Red Sox fans, the spanking administered to Wright should
have looked familiar. Just last week, the Sox had opened single,
single, Mo Vaughn home run against Wright, the pitcher Indians
general manager John Hart refused to trade for Pedro Martinez last
fall.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' six singles in the first, the first five of which
came against Wright, set an ALCS record for singles in an inning.
The first four Yankees to come to the plate _ Chuck Knoblauch,
Derek Jeter, O'Neill, and Williams _ all hit safely, plating two
runs.
</P>
<P>
   Tino Martinez grounded into a force play for the first out, but
a third run scored when Alomar couldn't smother Wright's wild
pitch. Tim Raines whiffed, but Wright walked Mantle stand-in Shane
Spencer, and Posada singled home Martinez to make it 4-0.
</P>
<P>
   Wright was done, but the Yankees weren't. Scott Brosius greeted
reliever Chad Ogea with a run-scoring single to make it 5-0 before
Knoblauch, batting for the second time in the inning, finally
tapped out.
</P>
<P>
   It was the 36th time this season the Yankees had batted around.
</P>
<P>
   Wells, meanwhile, took the mound to the sounds of one of his
head-banging favorites, Van Halen's ``Running With the Devil.''
Call it theme music for the Dark Side.

WRIGHT STUFF IS LACKING AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
 SIDEBAR-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Can Cleveland manager Mike Hargrove give the ball to
Jaret Wright for another start in the American League Championship
Series?
</P>
<P>
   Wright was routed in the first inning of Tuesday night's 7-2
loss to the Yankees in Game 1. He gave up singles to the first four
hitters and was unable to complete the inning. Hargrove needed long
man Chad Ogea to finish the first, which ended with the Yankees
leading, 5-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we get to Game 5, all bets are off,'' said Hargrove when
asked about bringing Wright back in turn. ``I'd have to look to
anybody. I would have to consider all the options.''
</P>
<P>
   The pummeling of Wright comes on the heels of his shaky
performance against the Red Sox in the first game of the Division
Series. Against Boston, Wright gave up hits to the first three
batters, including Mo Vaughn's three-run homer. He did not survive
the fifth inning of an 11-3 loss.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Knoblauch, Derek Jeter, Paul O'Neill, and Bernie Williams
opened the bottom of the first with back-to-back-to-back-to-back
singles. After a ground out and a strikeout, Wright walked
wonderboy Shane Spencer and surrendered an RBI single to Jorge
Posada. He was lifted after throwing only 36 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a combination of bad things,'' said Wright. ``The
location of my fastball was off. I was trying to make good pitches
and I didn't _ that's about it. I wasn't out there too long. I fell
behind in the count, and then you have to come in.''
</P>
<P>
   Hargrove said Wright's basic problem was twofold.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was up in the strike zone and he was in the middle of the
plate,'' said Hargrove. ``I don't care how hard you throw; if you
do that, you aren't going to last very long. Jaret went out and
gave us his best shot. I've seen him better. But am I angry at him?
No.''
</P>
<P>
   There is some bad blood between the Yankees and Wright that made
last night's easy win that much sweeter for the Yankee Stadium
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Wright beat the Yankees twice in four days of last year's
Division Series to knock the New Yorkers out of the tournament. In
a spring training game this year, he broke the hand of Yankees
infielder Luis Sojo with a pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night's Yankees starter, David Wells, painted the
22-year-old Wright as a classic headhunter, and New York's tabloids
used the revenge motive to inject some emotion into this series.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking with the media Monday, Wright, son of former Angels
lefthander Clyde Wright, said, ``It's about the third time I have
been asked if I'm hitting people or not. I'm out there trying to
get outs. I'm out there trying to keep my team in the ballgame.
It's baseball, and people get hit sometimes. But it is nothing. It
is not a revenge factor, I don't think.''
</P>
<P>
   It might not have been a revenge factor for Yankee players, but
the raucous Bronx crowd booed Wright with gusto during
introductions and hooted madly when he was hooked with two outs in
the first.
</P>
<P>
   In five innings over two starts in this postseason, Wright has
surrendered 11 runs and caused batters to swing and miss only seven
times. He appears to have lost some velocity since his impressive
1997 postseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still fairly young,'' said Wright. ``I look to learn from
this. There have been worse days. Sometimes it happens. Sometimes
you lose. It wasn't my day.''

INDIANS, PARTICULARLY WRIGHT, ARE HUMILIATED 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A humbled Jaret Wright shuffled off the field as the
crowd hurled insults and taunts at him high and tight. All he could
do was duck.
</P>
<P>
   Crestfallen and stunned, Wright slipped into the Cleveland
Indians' dugout early Tuesday night. The pitcher who had been
labeled a headhunter and cast as Public Enemy No. 1 before his
start in Game 1 of the American League Championship Series had just
dissolved, much to the delight of a crowd that packed every blue
inch of Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   He simply came undone, lasting just two-thirds of an inning in
the Cleveland Indians' 7-2 loss to the Yankees. He gave up five
runs _ an ALCS record for one inning _ under a barrage of lined
singles.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it was the pressure of the moment, the hostility
surrounding his start or the focus of the revenge-seeking Yankees
that caused Wright to buckle so quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, the Yankees' nemesis, armed with an
unapologetic attitude and a dangerous fastball, was gone after 36
pitches in the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   Wright not only had been the young charmer who popped up to beat
the Yankees twice in the division series a year ago, he had been at
the center of a feud that began seven months ago. In the spring,
Wright hurled a high and tight fastball that left a ducking Luis
Sojo with a broken left hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jaret is not a headhunter,'' Cleveland manager Mike Hargrove
had said on Monday, defending his Game 1 pitcher. ``But for Jaret
to be effective, he has to pitch inside. And that is part of the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the way Wright looked at it, too. After he hit Sojo,
there was no apology, not even a sympathetic nod from Wright, who
hit a dozen batters this season. Leading up to Game 1, Wright's
response to hitting Sojo was, ``That's baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Sojo said: ``The way it happened, he was going for my head. And
you can't do that. It's one thing to be aggressive, but you don't
go for my head.''
</P>
<P>
   The situation was only made worse when Wright hit Paul O'Neill
on June 19; and Wright picked up the victory in that game. During
the regular season, Wright's playoff success of 1997 carried over.
He was one of only four pitchers to beat the Yankees twice this
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Win, and that's our revenge,'' Sojo said. ``That's how you get
back at someone.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees got back at Wright on Tuesday night, and in a hurry.
Maybe the Yankees had him thinking about avoiding that inside
corner, because just about every fastball he served up was out over
the plate or wide of it. Mostly the latter. Wright was behind in
the count, 2-0, to four of the eight batters he faced.
</P>
<P>
   When he threw strikes, he grooved them right down the heart of
the plate, tantalizing the Yankee hitters. Chuck Knoblauch, Derek
Jeter, O'Neill and Bernie Williams began the game by smacking
consecutive singles to give the Yankees a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The 22-year-old Wright was visibly shaken, so much so that he
threw a wild pitch into the dirt that allowed the third of the five
runs he gave up to cross the plate. Before Wright could make it to
the bottom of the Yankees' order, Hargrove swooped down to lift
Wright out of his misery.
</P>
<P>
   This was not the night Wright had envisioned. Before the game,
he was thinking about last year, about how he had walked into a
raucous Yankee Stadium and tamed the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, sitting here, I was a lot more nervous,'' Wright
said. ``I think this year it is a little more easygoing for me, and
I can concentrate solely on pitching and trying to do my job the
best way that I can this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Wright was an unknown. This time, after all the talk
of feuds and paybacks, there was not a fan in the stadium who did
not know who he was. They booed him as he took the mound, and when
he handed the ball over to Hargrove, it was not over.
</P>
<P>
   Wright had to exit through a barrage of jeers coming from every
direction, high and tight, as he ducked into the dugout for safety.

DUCKS QB SMITH LEADS HOT FLOCK TO PULLMAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANGELO BRUSCAS  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two years ago, when he was the nation's top junior college
football recruit, Akili Smith called a news conference in his
native San Diego during the Holiday Bowl festivities to announce
his intentions.
</P>
<P>
   Washington State coach Mike Price had him high on his list, but
the Cougars had another quarterback in the way and Smith didn't
want to take a back seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always been impressed with Akili Smith, ever since high
school,'' Price said. ``I recruited him real hard out of high
school, and I think he was real interested in coming here. But we
had a quarterback, Ryan Leaf, at the time, so I suggested he go
someplace else.
</P>
<P>
   ``But not Oregon, for crying out loud. Someplace like New Mexico
or someplace where we wouldn't have to play him.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith raised some eyebrows when he announced he was heading for
Oregon for the 1997 season, only to end up splitting duties in a
two-quarterback system with junior Jason Maas. Smith finished
second to Maas in passing yards (1,631 to 1,385) and touchdowns (18
to 13), but now Smith is second to no one.
</P>
<P>
   He leads the nation in passing efficiency and is tops in the
Pac-10 in total offense, averaging 295 yards a game. He has thrown
12 touchdown passes in the Ducks' 4-0 season. Oregon seeks its
first five-win start since 1964 when it plays at WSU Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was expected to share the job with Maas but seized the job
for good in Oregon's Sept. 5 opener against Michigan State. He
threw four first-half touchdown passes, including a 53-yarder to
Tony Hartley, and completed 15 of 25 passes for 266 yards as the
Ducks romped 48-14.
</P>
<P>
   In three successive wins since then, Smith has thrown for 295
yards against Texas-El Paso, three touchdowns against San Jose
State and 357 yards and four touchdowns against Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I'm locked in,'' the 6-foot-3, 215-pound senior
declares.
</P>
<P>
   It's enough to cause the Duck promotions staff to start a
Heisman Trophy campaign. Oregon mailed 1,000 postcards Tuesday to
college football writers around the country.
</P>
<P>
   It includes this Bellotti quote: ``At this point in time, Akili
is playing at a level that's possibly unmatched here at the
University of Oregon.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, however, downplays any of the hype that follows his
statistics, and even makes light of the competition between himself
and Maas. He credits Maas with making him a better player this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jason Maas is a great quarterback and we're still competing
all during practice every week,'' Smith said. ``He's constantly
pushing me.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith's visit to Pullman Saturday will be his first since his
WSU recruiting trip. He hopes to avenge a 24-13 loss in Eugene last
year. Maas started that game, but was only 4-of-14 passing and
threw three interceptions before Smith replaced him.
</P>
<P>
   Smith rallied the Ducks by completing 14 of 30 passes for 204
yards and one touchdown, and running for 47 yards, but the Ducks
couldn't recover from a 21-3 halftime deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, we had a lot of opportunities to win the football
game and we didn't pull it out,'' said Smith, who beat Washington
four weeks later with a fourth-down pass in the game's final 2{
minutes. ``Hopefully, this year we can pull some of the close games
out and just continue to work toward the Rose Bowl. Everybody is
focused and ready to go.''
</P>
<P>
   For Smith, the 1998 season has been everything he hoped it would
be when he settled on his choice of schools after playing the 1996
season at Grossmont Junior College.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to play Pac-10 football since I was little, but a lot
of teams told me that if I didn't get out early, I would have to
redshirt,'' Smith said. ``Oregon was the only team that wasn't
saying that.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he felt comfortable with Bellotti and his coaching
staff. He credits much of his success this year to working during
the spring and summer with offensive coordinator Jeff Tedford, who
has helped Smith make the transition from a running quarterback to
a pocket passer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't been asked to scramble too much this year,'' Smith
said. ``Last year I had to scramble a little bit more because I was
sitting in the pocket and going through my full progression. Last
year, I would start on the wrong side and then try to come back to
the other side. By then, the defensive line would be bearing down
and I would have to scramble.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year, coach Tedford has done a heck of a job of letting
me know where to go pre-snap, so everything is going pretty well.''
</P>
<P>
   Tedford notes that Smith is no longer bound by doubts of being
placed in a two-quarterback system, and now has the game experience
to go with his natural athletic ability.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's playing with a lot of confidence right now, and doing a
great job putting the offense into successful situations with his
play-calling at the line of scrimmage,'' Tedford said. ``The rest
of the offense is making it easy for him.''
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean Smith won't free-lance on the run when he has
to.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game has changed so much now, it's so much faster and you
have to be able to move out there,'' Smith said. ``Sometimes,
something breaks down and you have to get out of there.''
</P>
<P>
   When Price looks at film of Smith now, he sees a legitimate
Heisman Trophy candidate much like Leaf was last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``He sits in the pocket a little longer and goes to his second
and third read,'' Price said of how Smith has matured. ``He is much
more accurate throwing the football, and is more of the total
package this year than he was last year. That just comes with
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   In hindsight, Price only wishes he had been able to sway Smith
to come to WSU.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's pretty much how I thought he was going to be _ pretty
darn good,'' Price said.

KINGS FINALLY STARTING TO SETTLE IN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Much has been made in recent months of the
boom in Southern California real estate. Perhaps an overlooked
contributor to that boom has been the improvement in the fortunes
of the Los Angeles Kings.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, when the team resided in the depths of the
National Hockey League standings, players came and went with such
regularity that some barely had time to sign leases, let alone
close home loans.
</P>
<P>
   These days, things are a little different. The Kings are coming
off their first playoff appearance since 1993 and are looking ahead
with high hopes to the new season, which begins Saturday night in
Edmonton. And for the Kings, success has been accompanied by their
own, small real-estate boom.
</P>
<P>
   Captain Rob Blake recently bought a place in Manhattan Beach _ a
fine idea for someone who earns more than $5 million a year. Among
the others on the team who have joined in the recent home-shopping
spree are winger Glen Murray, center Jozef Stumpel and defensemen
Steve Duchesne and Mattias Norstrom.
</P>
<P>
   Blake sees a correlation between success on the rink and the
Kings' off-ice acquisitiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time in the last six or seven years that
people are going out and buying houses on this team,'' Blake said.
``Before, no one would buy a house because they weren't going to be
here or they shouldn't have been here. Now ... we have a nucleus
that's going to grow, and that's the biggest thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess that's a comfort level,'' general manager Dave Taylor
said of all the action on the home front. ``We are trying to
establish more stability here in L.A. We don't want a lot of
turnover. Certainly a lot of our players we like very much. We'd
like them to stay with the club. We've had a lot of turmoil and a
lot of change over the years. Hopefully from now on we can have a
little more stability.''
</P>
<P>
   The team the Kings have built since trading Wayne Gretzky nearly
three years ago has been constructed through a variety of sources.
Of the 24 players expected to be on the final roster, five were
signed as free agents, 14 were acquired in trades and five were
draft choices. Two of the free agents (Duchesne and fellow
defenseman Garry Galley) and one of the players they traded for
(left wing Luc Robitaille) originally were drafted by the Kings.
</P>
<P>
   But what stands out the most is the Kings' youth. Their average
age is 27{. But of the 24 players, only six are older than 30, and
13 are 26 or younger.
</P>
<P>
   The 26-year-old Norstrom is a prime example of the type of
player the Kings have added. Recently, he purchased what he calls a
``fixer-upper'' in Manhattan Beach. But he should do fine with his
new home. After all, when he came to the Kings in a multiplayer
deal with the New York Rangers in 1996, the team itself was a
fixer-upper.
</P>
<P>
   One might expect Norstrom would have been disappointed to leave
a team such as the Rangers, who had won the Stanley Cup just two
years earlier. But Norstrom relished the chance to leave New York,
where thirtysomething veterans crowded him out of ice time, to come
to the Kings, where he knew he'd get to play.
</P>
<P>
   And guess what? Last season, the Kings made the playoffs and the
Rangers didn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made it clear from the start when I came here,'' Norstrom
said. ``They said, `We're rebuilding the team. We don't expect to
win the first year.' They said, `We're willing to really let things
take their time. We like the group of young players we have. And
further down the line we're going to make some additions.'''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor has done just that. Since becoming the general manager
after the 1996-97 season, he has used the draft to build the
foundation of the franchise and used trades and free agency to add
such veterans as Galley, Duchesne, Robitaille, Stumpel and Russ
Courtnall.
</P>
<P>
   But the brightest spot for the Kings is that the future has yet
to arrive. Only one rookie, winger Josh Green, has made the roster
to start the season. The organization is rife with draft choices
from the last few years who, if they eventually fulfill their
promise, will give the Kings a level of depth they never before
have enjoyed in their checkered three-decade existence.
</P>
<P>
   The approach the Kings have taken in building this team is, for
them, a complete historical departure. From 1969 to 1979, for
instance, the Kings traded their first-round draft choice each
year. Taylor says that won't happen during his tenure, even though
it probably would take a major trade to add a marquee forward who
would put fans in the seats and pucks in the net.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wants to win, and win every game,'' Taylor said.
``We all want to do that. But we have a long-term plan here. Our
plan is not to give up our younger players but rather to develop
those younger players and make them into good NHL players and stars
down the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a lot of good prospects in our system and we want to
continue to develop them. That doesn't mean if we get the right
offer that we might not move some of those young guys if there's an
established player available. But I don't think you're going to be
seeing us trading away first-round picks or good, young players for
a guy in his mid-30s.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Decision time: Josh Green's time is now. Olli Jokinen will
have to wait awhile longer.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings announced that the 19-year-old Jokinen, a
center/forward, will begin his season with their American Hockey
League affiliate in Springfield, Mass. Also Springfield-bound is
center Eric Belanger, who is sidelined with a broken wrist. Headed
to Long Beach to join the Ice Dogs are center Jason Morgan and
winger Dan Bylsma.
</P>
<P>
   Jokinen's demotion means the 20-year-old Green, a rookie left
wing, will start the season with the Kings, probably making his NHL
debut Saturday night in the season opener in Edmonton.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's moves reduced the roster to 26, two above the
regular-season limit. The Kings are set in goal with Stephane Fiset
and Jamie Storr, and also appear set at forward, where all 15 spots
are taken. There look to be two extra defensemen, probably Jaroslav
Modry and Mark Visheau, both of whom are injured.

   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
THE biggest problem is this: There isn't one.
</P>
<P>
   A simple, wave-the-magic-wand solution for what caused the
Astros to go splat, to fall squarely upon their swords against San
Diego, blowing their best opportunity in 37 seasons to earn a trip
to the World Series, does not exist.
</P>
<P>
   As constituted, they were already good enough to beat the
Padres, had they not hit like Madres. They were also good enough to
beat the Braves and probably the Yankees, too. They just flat-out
failed to give themselves the chance.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, we do realize the Astros weren't a fully rounded
club. Like most teams, even the rich ones, they could use stronger
relief pitching and a stud lefthanded hitter. However, given the
fiscal realities confronting general manager Gerry Hunsicker,
assuming Drayton McLane Jr. continues to demand the Astros be run
as a business rather than a hobby, they can't count on plugging
many holes over the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   They might not plug any of them, should Randy Johnson deign to
return.
</P>
<P>
   But cripes, even the Braves, with their seemingly limitless
resources, haven't pulled off a perfect tweaking. Remember, as bad
as you feel about your fallen heroes, Atlanta's kings of
underperformance, who begin their seventh consecutive NLCS against
San Diego tonight, have only one more set of World Series rings in
the '90s than the 'Stros do.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves are mated for life to the concept that starting
pitching is the truth, the light and the way, the road to eternal
happiness and salvation. And it's a concept that, given the
inordinate importance we place on pitching in the playoffs, we can
hardly quibble with.
</P>
<P>
   But in every Atlanta postseason except 1995, it has ultimately
led only to damnation _ usually because the Atlanta hitters have
failed at the wrong moments, or a jittery bullpen couldn't handle
its rare moments of grave responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   If the Astros believe they let everybody down, imagine the heat
that's on the Braves. Alone among all teams in baseball _ the
Yankees included _ they will be judged total failures if they don't
win the Series.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the misery-loves-company department, look at the
Rangers, whose payroll dwarfs that of the Astros. Texas' own
fearsome offense, which scored 5.8 runs per game in '98 and batted
.289, wound up with faces as red as its caps, finagling but a
single run in three defeats against a Yankees rotation that, for
all the New York hype, didn't post an ERA under 3.49.
</P>
<P>
   The knee-jerk reaction in Houston is to favor a core-deep
shake-up. After the way the Killer B's-turned-B-team performed in
another mission-aborted postseason, we ask if anybody should really
be untouchable. In these moments of extreme frustration, the
temptation is always there to turn the clubhouse upside down.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for 162 games, the Astros' lineup proved itself the National
League's most productive, the internal chemistry was sound, and you
customers reciprocated with record turnstile appreciation. Night in
and night out, the Astros proved a fun team to watch. As a result,
the franchise actually took tangible steps toward profitability
with 10 crowds of more than 50,000 and a 45,655 average for
Johnson's five home starts.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, next season's Astrodome farewell tour doesn't
guarantee even an encore. We know only too well, based on the two
Division Series losses, that the loudest of bats can be made to
fall suddenly silent, which is why re-signing Johnson, or obtaining
another of his ilk, stands as the offseason priority. It's the
safest bet to stay a satisfying April-to-October course.
</P>
<P>
   But until the Astros themselves (and the Rangers) figure out a
way to handle the elite pitchers _ Brown, Smoltz, Maddux, Glavine,
Wells, etc. _ with the ligament-stressing weight of playoff
pressure on them, there will be no Lone Star World Series. To date,
four postseason sessions since 1996 have resulted in a combined
2-12 record for Texas' backward two-steppers.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Dierker was already twitching a couple weeks ago, sensing
something wasn't right. He brought up the subject in St. Louis the
last Wednesday of the regular season after a 7-1 win.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, we hit OK tonight,'' Dierker said. ``But I've seen a
change in the way we're swinging our bats. We've lost our
aggressiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the Astros' final 13 games, seven of which were defeats,
they averaged a mere three runs per. During the previous 13, when
they went 11-2 and made the 100-victory plateau reachable, their
nightly norm was six.
</P>
<P>
   Straightening out a flummoxed hitter may be the most difficult
task in coaching, because making solid contact with a baseball is
the hardest job in sports. Sometimes it simply goes, and that's
that.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros stopped hitting, so they stopped playing. End of
story, and season. But with Johnson, there can be a next year for
this bunch.

 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
ATLANTA _ If the San Diego Padres like a good challenge _ and they
seemed to indicate that was the case while they were brushing aside
the Astros in the Division Series _ they're liable to fall in love
with the predicament they're in now.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The team of the decade is standing between the Padres and their
first World Series appearance since 1984, and history is not on San
Diego's side.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Braves are appearing in their seventh consecutive
National League Championship Series, and they've reached the World
Series four times during that stretch. The last time they were
defeated in the NLCS (1993), they reached the World Series in each
of the following two years in which there was a postseason, winning
it all in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   That does not bode well for the Padres, considering the Braves
lost the NL pennant to the Florida Marlins in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   So what does it all mean? It means it's time for the Braves to
make another run at the Fall Classic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect to win,'' Braves pitcher Greg Maddux said.
</P>
<P>
   So does just about everyone else who has an opinion on the
subject, and that's just the way the Padres seem to like it. San
Diego reached the NLCS by surprising the Astros in the first round,
and the Padres believe there is enough magic left in their season
to pull another shocker.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just won a series nobody gave us a chance to win, and now
we're playing Atlanta,'' Padres right fielder Tony Gwynn said. ``In
spring training, our goal was to try to get to the World Series and
win it. It has not changed. This is the biggest thrill of my
career. Going to the World Series in 1984 was great, but the long
wait in between makes this really nice right now.''
</P>
<P>
   John Smoltz and Andy Ashby, a pair of pitchers who each won 17
games in the regular season, will be on the mound tonight when the
series begins at Turner Field. But it's clearly a case of two
pitchers headed in opposite directions. Smoltz was one of the
hottest pitchers in the league when the season ended, and Ashby was
slumping miserably.
</P>
<P>
   The fact Ashby is starting Game 1 instead of ace Kevin Brown
already has some observers second-guessing Padres manager Bruce
Bochy. But because Brown made his last two starts on three days'
rest _ one day less than is customary _ Bochy decided to give the
ball to Ashby and hope tonight is the night he rediscovers his
first-half form.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's our horse,'' Bochy said of Brown, who will start Game 2.
``But you don't want to kill him.''
</P>
<P>
   That's just fine with the Braves, who don't want to face Brown
any sooner than they have to. He allowed the Astros only one run
and struck out 21 batters in 14 innings during the Division Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this whole series hinges on whether we beat Kevin
Brown or not,'' Braves third baseman Chipper Jones said. ``Facing
him is not one of the more enviable tasks in the National League.
He's nasty and dominating and as tough a competitor as anybody
there is.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves probably feel like Brown has a little payback coming
his way. The veteran righthander won two NLCS games against them as
a member of the Marlins last season, although the Braves hit him
well enough to win. Brown allowed 16 hits and seven runs in 15
innings during the 1997 NLCS.
</P>
<P>
   And speaking of payback, Padres super-sub Jim Leyritz also
should be on the Braves' list. Leyritz blasted a dramatic,
game-tying, three-run homer against the Braves in the 1996 World
Series, which Atlanta eventually lost to the New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Leyritz has been at it again lately, smacking three
game-changing home runs against the Astros in the Division Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, (Leyritz) has been a thorn in the side around here,
probably more so than anywhere else,'' Braves pitcher Denny Neagle
said. ``Well, I take that back. I'm sure he's ringing in the ears
of a lot of Houston Astros fans right now.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Scoring lots of runs early would be nice, Joe Torre,
the manager of the New York Yankees, mused before Tuesday night's
playoff game with Cleveland, as if he were considering a room
service menu. And the Yankees delivered.
</P>
<P>
   They pummeled the Indians' best pitcher, Jaret Wright, for five
runs in the first inning and went on to win, 7-2, in Game 1 of the
American League Championship Series. A crowd of 57,138 on a brisk
fall evening at Yankee Stadium basked in the glow of this seemingly
unbeatable team, a team that needs three more victories in this
four-of-seven-game series to reach the World Series for the second
time in three seasons and the 35th time in franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   Game 2 will be played on Wednesday afternoon, with the Indians'
Charles Nagy pitching against David Cone, before the series shifts
to Cleveland for the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Following a regular season in which they won 114 games, the most
in A.L. history, the Yankees are doing everything right in the
post-season. They swept Texas in the division series, limiting the
heavy-hitting Rangers to one run in three games, and on Tuesday
night they rocked the Indians with an immediate burst of offense,
consistently superb defense and more great pitching from David
Wells, who shut out the Indians until allowing a two-run home run
to Manny Ramirez in the ninth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, the Indians managed only four singles; the Yankees
have allowed just 3 runs and 18 hits in 36 innings in the
post-season. They have now won 118 games in the regular season and
playoffs combined, matching a feat achieved by only one other team
in baseball history: the 1906 Chicago Cubs, in a 154-game season
and a six-game World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Remarkably, the Yankees' confidence appears to be growing.
``It's like a steamroller building up steam,'' said Chuck
Knoblauch, their leadoff hitter.
</P>
<P>
   The confidence, Torre suggested, is built on the 114
regular-season victories, the belief that if they approach the game
the same way and play hard, they will win. Wells arrived at the
Stadium on Tuesday afternoon seeming self-assured and loose,
wearing dark sunglasses, high-top basketball sneakers, blue jeans
and a T-shirt. Fans waiting outside the players' entrance screamed
for him, and Wells nodded: No problem.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, he playfully donned a black jersey, with the
name of the heavy metal band Metallica stripped across the front,
and slipped into the dugout, jokingly suggesting that he might wear
this particular uniform on the field. If Wells felt nervous in any
way, he masked his feelings expertly.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe he and the Yankees have come to believe they are going
to win every game. Wright must have felt that way right off the
bat. He started for Cleveland, having beaten the Yankees twice in
the playoffs last year; this year, he was one of only five pitchers
who beat the Yankees twice in a regular season in which they lost
only 48 of 162 games. But the Yankees dismissed him on Tuesday
night as if they were swatting away an annoying insect.
</P>
<P>
   Wright likes throwing his fastball high in the strike zone, and
the Yankees wanted to make him bring the ball down. Tim Raines said
Monday that the Yankees wanted to get runners on base and make
Wright throw from the stretch position, rather than from a windup.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just don't think he's as comfortable with runners on
base,'' Raines said.
</P>
<P>
   They tested this theory immediately. Leading off the bottom of
the first, Knoblauch lined a single over second base, and Wright
had to work from the stretch. Derek Jeter lined a single through
the middle, Knoblauch stopping at second.
</P>
<P>
   Paul O'Neill battled Wright to a full count _ Wright would throw
36 pitches in the first inning _ and then, with both runners moving
on the 3-2 pitch, O'Neill golfed a single to right, scoring one
run. After Bernie Williams lined a single through the middle, Jeter
raced home.
</P>
<P>
   Four batters into their lineup, the Yankees had a 2-0 lead and
two runners on base.
</P>
<P>
   In the dugout, the players had a whiff of a big inning, one
player said later, some yelling: ``Keep it going. Let's keep it
going.'' Chad Ogea scrambled to start warming up in the Cleveland
bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   After a force-play grounder to second by Tino Martinez left
runners at first and third, Martinez stole second as Raines struck
out. There were two outs, and with another out, Wright would be in
good condition.
</P>
<P>
   But with Shane Spencer batting, Wright threw a curveball when it
appeared that catcher Sandy Alomar was expecting a fastball, and
the ball bounced between Alomar's legs for a wild pitch. O'Neill
crossed the plate with the Yankees third run. Spencer walked.
</P>
<P>
   Everything was going wrong for Wright.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Posada lined a single to right, another run scoring, and
Wright was finished. Because Wright broke Luis Sojo's left hand
with a tight pitch in a spring game, the Yankees have little regard
for the Cleveland pitcher, and fans at the Stadium showed their
disdain on Tuesday night. As Wright walked off the field, head
down, the crowd roared mockingly, thanking him for his effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who comes in here and tries to stop them,'' Wright
said, the crowd ``is going to take offense. They got me. Tomorrow
is another day.''
</P>
<P>
   But the first inning was still not over. Scott Brosius singled
off the reliever Ogea, driving in another run, and Wright's line
was complete _ two-thirds of an inning, five hits, five runs, one
walk, one strikeout.
</P>
<P>
   Wells, the only Yankees pitcher who acknowledges the
personalized chants from the right-field bleachers when he is on
the mound, had a big lead and used it to his advantage. Usually
aggressive anyway, Wells challenged the Indians with fastballs,
some sinking and some riding high in the strike zone.
</P>
<P>
   Omar Vizquel got Cleveland's second hit of the game in the third
inning, and Wells then struck out both Kenny Lofton and Joey Cora,
two batters who have hit him hard in the past. He breezed, aided by
a great play by Jeter at shortstop and Spencer's nice running catch
in left in the sixth. Wells, Posada said, ``was just able to
relax.''
</P>
<P>
   All the Yankees appear relaxed, absolutely sure they are going
to win. They have acknowledged the inherent pressure in playing the
post-season after their stunning performance in the regular season;
they must win the World Series to assure their legacy, to be
recognized as one of baseball's greatest teams.
</P>
<P>
   But there is inordinate stress on the Cleveland Indians, as
well: after winning 89 games, 25 fewer than the Yankees, during the
regular season and after seeing the Yankees' pitching completely
dominate the Rangers in the first round, what is going through the
minds of the Indians now?
</P>
<P>
   David Cone will find out soon enough.

49ERS OWNER EDDIE DEBARTOLO JR. GUILTY OF FELONY 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID DIETZ and HOWARD ARCENEAUX  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BATON ROUGE _ His head bowed and speaking in a subdued voice,
San Francisco 49ers owner Eddie DeBartolo Jr. pleaded guilty in
federal court Tuesday to a felony charge of failing to report that
Louisiana's former governor allegedly extorted $400,000 from him to
win a casino license.
</P>
<P>
   With the plea, DeBartolo avoided prison. But he agreed to pay $1
million in penalties, serve two years of probation and testify in
future trials against ex-Governor Edwin Edwards and his son,
Stephen, key targets in a federal probe into the state's gambling
industry.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony leading to DeBartolo's admission, FBI agent Jeffrey
Santini described an alleged two-year courtship in which DeBartolo
at first resisted but then finally agreed last year to pay Edwards
the money _ in crisp $100 bills _ to help him win the final
riverboat license to be awarded by the state's gaming commission.
</P>
<P>
   DeBartolo got the license but later withdrew from the project
when he was subpoenaed to testify before a grand jury investigating
the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking quietly and cordially, DeBartolo stood before U.S.
District Court Judge John Parker and admitted his guilt to the
charge, formally known as misprision of a felony _ knowing about a
crime and not reporting it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. DeBartolo, how do you plead?'' Parker asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guilty, your honor,'' DeBartolo said.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting three rows back in the courtroom, Edwards and his son
watched stoically.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, DeBartolo asserted that he had been victimized by
Edwards, who was a longtime friend of the DeBartolo family. He
described the courtroom experience as a ``little piece of hell.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am just very grateful we're in the position we are now,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   DeBartolo's plea did nothing immediately to resolve his limbo
status with the 49ers, nor did it lend any new impetus to the
team's plan to build a $325 million stadium and mall project at
Candlestick Point.
</P>
<P>
   DeBartolo resigned as team president last year after word of the
Louisiana investigation became public. But he wants to return in
full charge by buying out his sister, Denise DeBartolo York, who is
co-owner of the franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to start the process of getting my football team
back,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In his testimony, FBI agent Santini said that Edwards first
approached DeBartolo in 1994, shortly after the death of
DeBartolo's father, and said he wanted a ``business'' relationship
with the 49ers' owner.
</P>
<P>
   When DeBartolo Entertainment Co. and a partner, Hollywood Casino
Corp., applied for the final riverboat license, Edwards offered to
help DeBartolo, according to Santini.
</P>
<P>
   In late 1996, Edwards was allegedly overheard by federal agents
telling DeBartolo in a telephone call, ``I want to make sure before
we go through all this that we . . . still have the votes on the
commission to get the license. . . . In the meantime, I'm . . .
talking to a friend of mine on the commission to ask him to feel
out to see.''
</P>
<P>
   Santini said that an unidentified DeBartolo Entertainment
official tried repeatedly to warn DeBartolo not to do business with
Edwards. While at first backing off, according to Santini,
DeBartolo agreed in the bar of a Baton Rouge hotel on March 5,
1997, to turn over the $400,000 as a vote on his license
application loomed.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the course of the meeting,'' a government affidavit
said, ``Edwin Edwards showed DeBartolo a piece of paper upon which
he (Edwards) had written the figure, `$400,000,' and told him he
needed the money before the vote, and if he did not receive it
there could be problems with the application.''
</P>
<P>
   The government secretly recorded the meeting, as it did another
on March 24 when Edwards met with an unidentified former public
official in Edwards' office to turn over the money.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, according to government allegations, told the former
official to ``make sure that everybody involved is careful about
how that's passed out'' because an investigation had begun.
</P>
<P>
   Santini said that besides the $400,000, Edwards had wanted
DeBartolo to pay him consulting fees of $50,000 a month, as well as
a fee for each person who gambled at the riverboat.
</P>
<P>
   After the court proceeding, the dapper, droll Edwards rejected
the government's recorded conversations as distortions and said he
will be proved innocent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will suggest to you that for anyone to assume that I, a year
after I was out of the governor's office, was in a position to do
damage to this man . . . is certainly a giant leap from any kind of
logic.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he had no ill will toward DeBartolo but then deadpanned,
``I hope the 49ers lose on Sunday'' when they play New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement with the government, DeBartolo's $1 million
penalty was paid at once. Of the sum, $350,000 is intended as
restitution for any victims of the alleged fraud.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, National Football League Commissioner Paul
Tagliabue said he has asked DeBartolo to remain in limbo until the
league can review DeBartolo's plea and ``related matters'' before
deciding whether he can regain control of the 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. DeBartolo's decision to enter a plea in Louisiana is not
based on any understandings with or commitments from this office
regarding his future status with the 49ers or the NFL,'' Tagliabue
said.
</P>
<P>
   York issued a statement that gave no indication that she plans
to relinquish her share of the team.
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging her brother's legal problems, York said the
49ers have ``strong management'' that remains committed to the
team's success.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference before DeBartolo entered his plea, Mayor
Willie Brown would not discuss DeBartolo's legal troubles but
insisted that the 49ers' stadium-mall project is on track.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no knowledge of the situation in New Orleans at all,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Brown met with 49ers' President Larry Thrailkill
after Thrailkill suggested that the project could be thwarted by
escalating costs.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, Brown said Thrailkill would quickly send the city
detailed information from the team's stadium consultants. Brown
said Tuesday he still does not have the material.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that, Brown said the city and the 49ers have been
meeting on the stadium issue, discussing ways to bring down costs.
</P>
<P>
   Thrailkill estimated that costs had ballooned to $500 million.
After meeting with Brown, however, he vowed to build a stadium for
$325 million, with the city's cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   The Mills Corp., the Virginia developer that wants to build a
huge shopping and entertainment complex next door to the 49ers'
planned stadium, was pleased by the plea.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mills Corp. remains fully committed to building
Candlestick Mills as an integral part of the new 49ers stadium,''
said a statement from Mills group vice president Edward Vinson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are pleased to know that Eddie DeBartolo is resolving his
legal issues, and we hope that today's decision opens a door that
will enable all parties to the development to proceed on a
fast-track basis.''

LUNGREN CUTS INTO DAVIS' LEAD IN POLL 
</HEADLINE>
   By CARLA MARINUCCI and ROBERT B. GUNNISON  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Republican gubernatorial candidate Dan Lungren
is slowly gaining on Democrat Gray Davis _ but with less than a
month to go, Davis still holds a six-point lead among likely
voters, a new Field Poll shows.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, the California lieutenant governor, leads the battle for
the state's highest office with 48 percent of likely voters,
compared with 42 percent for state Attorney General Lungren. Five
percent are undecided and an equal number support minor party
candidates, the poll shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're seeing is a firming up on both sides, with
Democrats and Republicans each getting behind their
standard-bearers,'' said Mark DiCamillo, director of the Field
Poll. ``What might provide the difference is the independents _ and
they're siding with Davis by a 14-point margin.''
</P>
<P>
   But the crucial gubernatorial race _ which could decide the
balance of power between parties here for years to come _ will get
even closer if tradition holds. Since 1974, every open race for
that office has been decided by less than four percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   This year's contest is still very fluid, DiCamillo said, and
could yet be shaped by factors including the prospect of
impeachment hearings of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are events going on in Washington that will affect the
political backdrop,'' DiCamillo said. ``There's lots of campaign
money has yet to be spent _ and the power of political ads should
never be underestimated.''
</P>
<P>
   Campaign finance reports released this week showed Davis
comfortably ahead in the money category, with over $3 million more
cash on hand than Lungren.
</P>
<P>
   But there are other signs that give Davis reason to worry, the
poll showed.
</P>
<P>
   Only 72 percent of Democratic men are supporting Davis, compared
with 83 percent for Lungren among Republican men. That is
significant, DiCamillo said, because men are more likely voters
than women.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Davis is failing to attract significant support from
Republican women, whom he hoped would defect from the GOP because
of Lungren's adamant opposition to abortion rights. ``We're seeing
79 percent of Republican women supporting Lungren and 15 percent
supporting Davis,'' said DiCamillo. ``It's not a hemorrhage or a
significant erosion to Davis.''
</P>
<P>
   Another concern for Davis is support for minor party candidates,
particularly Green Party candidate Dan Hamburg, a former North
Coast Democratic congressman who has said he welcomes the role of a
spoiler in the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hamburg's is a liberal constituency, Northern Californian,
younger. That's an important element in the mix, especially if the
race should get closer,'' DiCamillo said.
</P>
<P>
   On election day, Lungren could benefit from an expected low
turnout. Earlier this week, the Field Poll predicted that just 44
percent of eligible adults will go to the polls, one of the lowest
figures in state history, with Republicans, whites, males and
seniors the most likely to be among them.
</P>
<P>
   The poll also shows:
</P>
<P>
   --Four out of five Democrats favor Davis; an equal number of
Republicans favor Lungren. Davis would get 13 percent of GOP votes,
but that would be offset by Lungren's take of 11 percent of
Democratic votes.
</P>
<P>
   --Lungren holds a one-point edge among white voters, who
represent 77 percent of the likely voters. Davis has a huge lead of
62 percent to 26 percent among Latino, African American, Asian and
other minority voters, who represent 23 percent of the likely
voters.
</P>
<P>
   --Geographically, Davis holds a commanding lead over Lungren in
Northern California (52 percent to 36 percent), home to about 43
percent of the likely voters; in Southern California, where 57
percent of the state's likely voters reside, Lungren and Davis are
even at 45 percent. In the Central Valley, a region crucial to any
Republican candidate, Lungren now holds a five-point lead. ``It's
good news for Lungren'' said DiCamillo, although ``usually, a
Republican wants to come out of the Central Valley with a
double-digit lead.'' Eight years ago, Pete Wilson defeated Dianne
Feinstein by 10 points in Fresno County.
</P>
<P>
   --Both candidates' images have suffered from the largely
negative ads that have prevailed so far on both sides. Lungren is
rated favorably by 52 percent and unfavorably by 34 percent,
compared with 58 percent to 29 percent a month ago. Davis, however,
is rated favorably by 51 percent of voters, unfavorably by 33
percent, a marked change from the ratings of 65 percent to 23
percent enjoyed in August.
</P>
<P>
   The Field Poll was conducted September 27 to October 5 with a
statewide sample of 998 registered voters, of whom 703 were
determined to be likely voters in the November election. It has a
margin of error of plus or minus 3.8 percentage points.

CLINTON DEMANDS FUNDS FOR IMF 
</HEADLINE>
   By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton called on financial leaders
Tuesday to take ``urgent steps'' to address what he called the
world's ``most serious crisis in half a century.''
</P>
<P>
   Addressing officials from the 182-member nation International
Monetary Fund and the World Bank, Clinton warned that the financial
chaos is undermining world prosperity and faith in free-market
democracies.
</P>
<P>
   The global economy ``simply cannot live with the kinds of vast
and systemic disruptions that have occurred over the past year,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   After a long battle, the House appeared ready to join the Senate
in acceding to Clinton's demand for an additional $14.5 billion
injection of U.S. funds into the IMF once certain conditions are
met.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has come under attack by other nations for
recommending global financial reforms and new emergency lending to
Brazil, while at the same time refusing to bolster the resources of
the IMF, the agency responsible for managing the world financial
system.
</P>
<P>
   IMF member nations have agreed to a $90 billion expansion of its
reserves, and Clinton pressured the House again Tuesday to approve
the U.S. share.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can debate how to reform the operations of the fire
department, but there is no excuse for refusing to supply the fire
department with water while the fire is burning,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition to the U.S. contribution has been led by House
Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, who wants the IMF to set
market interest rates on its loans and limit them to one year. ``We
must have these reforms, or there cannot be any increase in
funding,'' Armey said.
</P>
<P>
   Although apparently willing to accept at least some of Armey's
conditions, the administration argues that the United States cannot
unilaterally dictate terms to a multination agency; IMF officials
have said that the agency answers to 182 nations, not the U.S.
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Other critics contend that Armey's plan to set market terms on
IMF loans would remove the rationale for IMF lending: Countries
turn to the IMF during a balance-of-payments crisis when there is a
loss of market confidence. If countries could raise money on the
international capital markets, critics say, they wouldn't need IMF
loans in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton appealed mainly for long-term changes to financial
markets, saying they need the kinds of regulatory frameworks long
operating in industrialized countries _ many adopted after the
Depression _ such as strong banking supervision, ``transparent,''
or open, accounting standards and bank deposit insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Although international markets differ from domestic markets,
``some of the same functions clearly need to be performed,''
Clinton said. ``We must address not only a run on a bank or a firm,
but also a run on nations.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton reiterated the administration's call for an emergency
line of credit to help Brazil avoid a foreign-exchange crisis
triggered by panicked investors fleeing all emerging markets after
Russia's August 15 default.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's proposals mirrored a speech last week by U.S. Treasury
Secretary Robert Rubin, the former Goldman Sachs investment banker
who is the architect of Clinton's economic policies and a strong
advocate of open financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   Despite disagreements, world financial leaders appeared to be
moving toward at least a vague consensus on the steps necessary to
prevent the further spread of the financial meltdown that began in
Thailand 14 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Group of Seven industrialized nations _ the United States,
Canada, France, Italy, Britain, Japan and Germany _ agree that they
must sustain growth in Europe and the United States, although there
still is no plan for a coordinated cut in interest rates. However,
U.S. Federal Reserve officials said this week that further U.S.
cuts in interest rates may be on the way given the shaky global
outlook and the credit crunch now gaining steam as domestic lenders
grow more cautious.
</P>
<P>
   ``The principal goal of policymakers must be to promote
growth,'' Clinton said. ``The most important thing we can do is to
keep our economy growing and open to others' products and
services.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also rising alarm and frustration over Japan, seen as
the keystone to reviving world growth. Clinton pointedly singled
out Japan, saying the ``health of Asia and indeed the world'' rests
on reviving its economy.
</P>
<P>
   IMF managing director Michel Camdessus referred to Japan as
``the crisis at the heart of the crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   Japanese officials seem unwilling to adopt the deep, permanent
tax cuts that economists widely believe are vital to pulling Japan
out of its worst recession since World War II, or to take bold
action to fix its banking system, which is essentially insolvent.
</P>
<P>
   The Financial Times of London reported Tuesday that the Japanese
government is considering two unorthodox stimulus schemes: giving
30,000 yen, equivalent to $220, in pocket money to each of its 125
million citizens, and declaring a series of ``Happy Monday''
holidays for citizens to spend shopping instead of working.
</P>
<P>
   Such steps are unlikely to be perceived as the serious
macroeconomic and banking remedies financial markets are seeking.
</P>
<P>
   Finance ministers also are increasingly moving toward
significant changes to global financial structures advocated,
albeit in different forms, by Britain, France and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin favors a more market-based approach to disciplining
capital flows, emphasizing open bookkeeping in developing countries
so that investors better understand risks, along with stronger
banking systems, accounting standards and other measures to
strengthen the rules and institutions that support capital markets.
The idea is that better information will allow market discipline to
minimize wild bouts of euphoria or panic, and higher financial
standards will keep banks and corporations on a sounder footing.
</P>
<P>
   Britain and France favor a more regulatory approach. British
chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown has called for a
``Standing Committee for Global Financial Regulation'' to establish
standards for capital flows.

 ENTERTAINMENT SUMMARY No 405 - October 7, 1998   ENTERTAINMENT
SUMMARY -- No. 405 -- Oct. 7, 1998 We are offering the following
articles for sale. Please contact us for availability your country.
Best regards, Karl Horwitz
<TEXT>
<P>
   1. JONI MITCHELL FOR THE '90S At 54, Joni Mitchell has suddenly
found herself in possession of a daughter she gave up for adoption
in the '60s, a grandson and a desire to write light songs. But
she's still an iconoclast - and a dazzling egoiste. By Neil
Strauss. From The New York Times Magazine. Full-length article
(3,100 words) + edited version available. 2. PLAYING PAMMY
Ann-Margret plays the late, great, courtesan/diplomat Pamela
Harriman in a new TV movie. ``I keep saying, how did she do so many
things with her life and have so many men? It was like five
lifetimes,'' says Ann-Margret, who's been married for 31 years to
the same man, former actor Roger Smith. Roger's illness,
Ann-Margret admits, forced her to take a stronger role in both
business and life, granting her a new freedom. By Louise Farr. From
W magazine. 1,500 words + photo. 3. HOLLYWOOD REDISCOVERS THE
HEREAFTER Hollywood seems to be taking note of the fact that the
century is racing to its conclusion. And just like the Victorians
at the end of the 19th century, with their seances and their
interest in the occult, movie makers are preoccupied with some very
strange things. Witness the current and future spate of movies
dealing with death, dying, angels, the afterlife, heaven and hell.
By Ivor Davis. 1,000 words + photos. (N/A Great Britain and
Australia.) 4. OPRAH WINFREY'S LONG JOURNEY TO 'BELOVED' Even
multi-millionnaire television stars have dreams, and for 11 years,
Oprah Winfrey's has been to make a movie of Toni Morrison's
award-wining - but apparently unfilmable - novel, ``Beloved.'' Now
that dream has been realized, with Winfrey as producer and star of
the film. In this interview she tells why she devoted more than a
decade to getting it made, how she approached her first-ever sex
scenes and how she thinks making ``Beloved'' has changed her
forever. By Cindy Pearlman. 1,400 words + photo. 5. FACE VALUE :
DEARLY ``BELOVED'' - OPRAH WINFREY CARTOON Artist Ricardo Castaneda
offers an intriguing cartoon of Oprah Winfrey, shown in a
character-filled drawing as seen in her upcoming film, ``Beloved.''
</P>
<P>
   6. IAN MCKELLEN TAKES ANOTHER WALK ON THE WILD SIDE Sir Ian
McKellen has played a lot of villains, from Richard III to Death
himself, but ``Apt Pupil'' may be his scariest ever. Based on a
Stephen King novella, the film casts him as an elderly ex-Nazi who
has been living quietly in a small American town for decades, until
a high-school student learns his secret and demands inside
information about the Nazi atrocities he committed. ``This is a
nasty little story, and it will have reverberations,'' McKellen
acknowledges. In this interview he also talks about his outspoken
advocacy of gay rights in Britain, why he has had no long-term
relationship in his life for many years and why, as he approaches
60, this universally admired actor is driving himself harder than
ever (he even has his own website which he designed and created.)
By Jean Oppenheimer. 1,400 words + photo.
_______________________________________________________________ 7.
DENNIS FARINA DOES 'FARO' The name might not ring a bell, but
you've definitely seen this veteran actor as either the cop, the
private investigator or the bad guy in films like ``Midnight Run,''
``Get Shorty'' and ``Manhunter.'' This autumn Dennis Farina returns
in ``Buddy Faro'' as a Los Angeles private investigator who
vanished in the 70s. He resurfaces in the '90s to find the city a
much-changed place. By Joshua Mooney. BPI. 1,000 words.
_______________________________________________________________ 8.
JOAN ALLEN : THE ACTRESS'S ACTRESS Joan Allen doesn't play
good-hearted prostitutes, sexy murderesses or screaming stalkees,
but a lot of people think she's the best actress in Hollywood - and
she has two Oscar nominations, for ``Nixon'' (1995) and ``The
Crucible'' (1996,) to back them up. Her latest film,
``Pleasantville,'' is an offbeat comedy-drama in which she plays
the mother in a fictitious 1950s television sitcom. In this
interview Allen talks about ``Pleasantville,'' why she is so
notoriously choosy about the films she makes, how she handled her
two Oscar losses and why Hollywood's favourite serious actress is
looking for the right comedy. By Ian Spelling. 1,400 words + photo.

   Hispanics, long dismissed as a marginal force in U.S. politics,
are now being avidly courted by Republicans and Democrats alike.
The reason: The number of Hispanics is climbing so rapidly that by
2005 they will be the nation's largest minority and by 2050 will
make up one-quarter of the U.S. population.
</P>
<P>
   The Hearst News Service and The San Antonio Express-News examine
this trend in a package of stories on the new political clout of
Hispanics in America. The stories are for release starting Sunday,
Oct. 11. Graphics from the San Antonio Express-News have been
posted on the Wieck database. Photos from the Hearst Newspapers'
Washington bureau will be posted on Wieck Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   For questions about stories, please call Susie McBee of The
Hearst Newspapers' Washington bureau at 202-298-6920 or David
Sheppard of The San Antonio Express-News at 210-250-3216. For
questions about graphics or photos, please call Hallie Paul at
210-250-3301.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the story lineup:
</P>
<P>
   For Sunday, Oct. 11:
</P>
<P>
   HISPANIC-CLOUT (Washington) _ Republicans and Democrats are
making an unprecedented effort to win Hispanic support, not only
for next month's election but for 2000 and beyond. Strategists for
both parties are amazed at Hispanics' zooming population growth and
believe that Latino voters are willing to switch party allegiance,
depending on candidates and issues. By STEWART M. POWELL.
</P>
<P>
   With graphics slugged HISP-LOGO, HISP-GROWTH, HISP-REGISTERED,
HISP-VOTERS and HISP-PRESIDENTIAL-ELECTIONS.
</P>
<P>
   With HISP photos.
</P>
<P>
   HISPANIC-HISTORY (Washington) _ For Hispanics, the long march to
political power began shortly after World War II. We trace the
effort, looking at such leaders as Cesar Chavez, who won national
attention with his efforts to organize migrant farm workers in
California, and Dr. Hector Garcia, who stirred outrage across the
country at the refusal of a Texas town to bury a deceased World War
II veteran in the local cemetery because he was a Mexican American.
By MARK HELM.
</P>
<P>
   With HISP photos.
</P>
<P>
   For Monday, Oct. 12:
</P>
<P>
   HISPANIC-GOVERNORS (Del Rio, Texas) _ Texas Gov. George Bush
gets a warm welcome in Hispanic communities. Some Latinos say he is
more sympathetic to their concerns than other Republicans,
especially Gov. Pete Wilson of California, who has taken harsh
stances on immigration and affirmative action. The men's
differences illustrate the mixed messages the party sends to
Hispanics. By LAURA TOLLEY. With HISP-LOGO graphic.
</P>
<P>
   HISPANIC-TEXAS (San Antonio) _ A look at the rising power of
Hispanics in various cities including San Antonio and Corpus
Christi, where Hispanics have city council majorities, and El Paso
and McAllen, which have Hispanic mayors. We also look at the
campaigns of Mexican Americans running for statewide offices. By
LAURA TOLLEY.
</P>
<P>
   With graphic slugged HISP-TEXAS.
</P>
<P>
   For Tuesday, Oct. 13:
</P>
<P>
   HISPANIC-CONTESTS (Washington) _ From the streets of Salt Lake
City to the lake lands of Minnesota, Hispanic candidates are
running for office in state and congressional races that would have
seemed almost impossible for them to enter only a few years ago.
The development comes at a time when more Hispanics are running for
national and statewide posts generally. By MARK HELM and STEWART M.
POWELL.
</P>
<P>
   With HISP-LOGO graphic.
</P>
<P>
   HISPANIC-DIFFERENCES (Washington) _ Republican and Democratic
politicians are learning that they cannot regard Hispanics as a
monolith. We look at the cross-currents between certain groups and
within the groups themselves. Republicans believe they have a
chance to take many Hispanic votes away from the Democrats. By MARK
HELM.

GROWTH OF THE HISPANIC VOTE: A POLITICAL EARTHQUAKE IN THE MAKING

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hispanics, long dismissed as a marginal force by
both political parties, are now being avidly courted by Republicans
and Democrats alike.
</P>
<P>
   What the pols have discovered _ much to their amazement _ is
that the number of Hispanics is climbing so rapidly that by 2005
they will overtake African Americans as the nation's largest
minority and by 2050 will make up a quarter of the U.S. population.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Cisneros, a former San Antonio mayor who was housing
secretary in President Clinton's first Cabinet, sees a political
earthquake in the offing as Hispanics emerge as a swing vote in key
states.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have just now begun to achieve critical mass with enough
votes to make a difference,'' says Cisneros. ``It's a powerful
development.''
</P>
<P>
   He adds that the zooming population growth _ coupled with
politicians' belief that Hispanics are willing to switch allegiance
depending on candidates and issues _ means that ``we have within
our reach the ability to influence'' the outcome in 10 states
accounting for 214 of the 270 electoral votes needed to win the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   So both parties are making an unprecedented effort to woo
Hispanic voters.
</P>
<P>
   On the Republican side, House Speaker Newt Gingrich told a
national gathering here of Hispanic leaders: ``We want to work with
you.'' The group had been convened by a longtime civil rights
organization, the nonpartisan League of United Latin American
Citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Gingrich invited a prominent Mexican American from
Texas, Republican Tony Garza, who is running for a state railroad
commission seat, to be his guest at President Clinton's State of
the Union address. The speaker hired Sandra Hernandez, a public
relations specialist, as his assistant press secretary to handle
the Spanish-language media.
</P>
<P>
   In California GOP gubernatorial candidate Dan Lungren and
Republican Matt Fong, a U.S. Senate candidate, are campaigning in
barrios and targeting TV ads to reach Hispanic voters. They are
trying to counter the antipathy fostered by the outgoing California
governor, Pete Wilson, who swept to a second term in 1994 by
playing to anti-immigrant sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last four years Wilson has backed GOP-sponsored ballot
initiatives that sought to bar most public services for
undocumented immigrants, halt affirmative action in state
contracting, hiring and public college admission, and end bilingual
education in schools.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Texas Republican Gov. George W. Bush is ``perceived
in every way as a friendly Anglo'' among Hispanics, according to
Valerie Martinez, a political science professor at Texas Christian
University.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the perception stems from Bush's refusal to endorse a
number of GOP anti-immigrant measures. This year he has repeatedly
campaigned for reelection in areas with high Hispanic populations _
San Antonio, El Paso and the Rio Grande Valley _ and is expected to
win with strong Hispanic support. Aides say at least 25 percent of
his TV budget is devoted to ads, some in Spanish and English,
targeted to Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Republicans scored a major coup this summer by
enlisting former Democratic Rep. Herman Badillo to their cause.
Badillo was the first Puerto Rican native elected to Congress, and
he helped found the Congressional Hispanic Caucus in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Charging that Democrats ``take their historic constituencies for
granted,'' Badillo has embarked on a ``marathon'' campaign around
the country to encourage Hispanics to vote for Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Another prominent Hispanic, Republican Rep. Henry Bonilla of
Texas, is also leading a GOP outreach effort. For months he has
been on the campaign trail seeking to boost Hispanic turnout for
Republican candidates in Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada and
California.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing the potential of the Hispanic vote, the Republican
National Committee began in March to sponsor a Spanish-language GOP
response to President Clinton's weekly radio address each Saturday.
The response provides a national podium to Hispanic politicians,
whose speeches go to more than 200 Spanish-language radio stations
and networks.
</P>
<P>
   Lorenzo C. Lopez, co-director of the GOP's New Majority Council,
which honchos the party's efforts to reach minorities, says the
Spanish-speakers deal with issues in Hispanics' neighborhoods
``that affect their daily lives _ crime, drugs and education. ...
Republicans are not changing our message, but we are tailoring it
so that it connects with the community.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the GOP is appealing to Hispanics by including San
Antonio, a city of a million people that is 55.6 percent Mexican
American, as one of the sites it is considering for its 2000
national convention. A decision is expected late this year.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, party strategists see the rising number
of Hispanics as critical to their comeback in the South and West,
where for more than a decade they have lost House, Senate and
gubernatorial races.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic National Chairman Roy Romer, the governor of
Colorado, says, ``The growth of the Hispanic population is key to
our ascendancy in those states ... that are currently seen as
Republican strongholds.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has led his party's courtship of Hispanics,
who, except for Cuban Americans, have traditionally given at least
60 percent of their vote to Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has appointed more Hispanics to high-profile jobs than
any other president, appeared before numerous Hispanic audiences
and advocated policies that they like, such as support for
affirmative action, funds for inner city schools, greater access to
health care and aid for legal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Hispanics Clinton has appointed to key posts are
Federico Pena, first as transportation secretary and then energy
secretary; Bill Richardson, first as U.S. ambassador to the United
Nations and then as energy secretary when Pena resigned, and Maria
Echaveste, first as White House liaison with interest groups and
then as one of two deputy White House chiefs of staff, the highest
White House post ever held by a Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   The president also named Aida Alvarez to head the Small Business
Administration, Mickey Ibarra as White House intergovernmental
affairs director, George Munoz to lead the Overseas Private
Investment Corporation and Louis Caldera as secretary of the Army.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has spoken at the annual Congressional Hispanic Caucus
dinner in Washington, D.C., every year since he has been president.
When he proclaimed National Hispanic Heritage Month from Sept. 15
to Oct. 15, the president vowed to ``ensure that all Hispanic
American families have the tools and opportunities they need to
make the most of their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Following the GOP's lead, the Democratic National Committee in
May launched weekly Spanish-language broadcasts to appeal to
Hispanic audiences. The DNC hired communications expert Evangelina
Garcia as deputy press secretary to deal with Hispanic news
outlets.

accounting for 214 of the 270 electoral votes needed to win the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   So both parties are making an unprecedented effort to woo
Hispanic voters.
</P>
<P>
   On the Republican side, House Speaker Newt Gingrich told a
national gathering here of Hispanic leaders: ``We want to work with
you.'' The group had been convened by a longtime civil rights
organization, the nonpartisan League of United Latin American
Citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Gingrich invited a prominent Mexican American from
Texas, Republican Tony Garza, who is running for a state railroad
commission seat, to be his guest at President Clinton's State of
the Union address. The speaker hired Sandra Hernandez, a public
relations specialist, as his assistant press secretary to handle
the Spanish-language media.
</P>
<P>
   In California GOP gubernatorial candidate Dan Lungren and
Republican Matt Fong, a U.S. Senate candidate, are campaigning in
barrios and targeting TV ads to reach Hispanic voters. They are
trying to counter the antipathy fostered by the outgoing California
governor, Pete Wilson, who swept to a second term in 1994 by
playing to anti-immigrant sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last four years Wilson has backed GOP-sponsored ballot
initiatives that sought to bar most public services for
undocumented immigrants, halt affirmative action in state
contracting, hiring and public college admission, and end bilingual
education in schools.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Texas Republican Gov. George W. Bush is ``perceived
in every way as a friendly Anglo'' among Hispanics, according to
Valerie Martinez, a political science professor at Texas Christian
University.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the perception stems from Bush's refusal to endorse a
number of GOP anti-immigrant measures. This year he has repeatedly
campaigned for reelection in areas with high Hispanic populations _
San Antonio, El Paso and the Rio Grande Valley _ and is expected to
win with strong Hispanic support. Aides say at least 25 percent of
his TV budget is devoted to ads, some in Spanish and English,
targeted to Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Republicans scored a major coup this summer by
enlisting former Democratic Rep. Herman Badillo to their cause.
Badillo was the first Puerto Rican native elected to Congress, and
he helped found the Congressional Hispanic Caucus in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Charging that Democrats ``take their historic constituencies for
granted,'' Badillo has embarked on a ``marathon'' campaign around
the country to encourage Hispanics to vote for Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Another prominent Hispanic, Republican Rep. Henry Bonilla of
Texas, is also leading a GOP outreach effort. For months he has
been on the campaign trail seeking to boost Hispanic turnout for
Republican candidates in Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada and
California.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing the potential of the Hispanic vote, the Republican
National Committee began in March to sponsor a Spanish-language GOP
response to President Clinton's weekly radio address each Saturday.
The response provides a national podium to Hispanic politicians,
whose speeches go to more than 200 Spanish-language radio stations
and networks.
</P>
<P>
   Lorenzo C. Lopez, co-director of the GOP's New Majority Council,
which honchos the party's efforts to reach minorities, says the
Spanish-speakers deal with issues in Hispanics' neighborhoods
``that affect their daily lives _ crime, drugs and education. ...
Republicans are not changing our message, but we are tailoring it
so that it connects with the community.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the GOP is appealing to Hispanics by including San
Antonio, a city of a million people that is 55.6 percent Mexican
American, as one of the sites it is considering for its 2000
national convention. A decision is expected late this year.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, party strategists see the rising number
of Hispanics as critical to their comeback in the South and West,
where for more than a decade they have lost House, Senate and
gubernatorial races.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic National Chairman Roy Romer, the governor of
Colorado, says, ``The growth of the Hispanic population is key to
our ascendancy in those states ... that are currently seen as
Republican strongholds.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has led his party's courtship of Hispanics,
who, except for Cuban Americans, have traditionally given at least
60 percent of their vote to Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has appointed more Hispanics to high-profile jobs than
any other president, appeared before numerous Hispanic audiences
and advocated policies that they like, such as support for
affirmative action, funds for inner city schools, greater access to
health care and aid for legal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Hispanics Clinton has appointed to key posts are
Federico Pena, first as transportation secretary and then energy
secretary; Bill Richardson, first as U.S. ambassador to the United
Nations and then as energy secretary when Pena resigned, and Maria
Echaveste, first as White House liaison with interest groups and
then as one of two deputy White House chiefs of staff, the highest
White House post ever held by a Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   The president also named Aida Alvarez to head the Small Business
Administration, Mickey Ibarra as White House intergovernmental
affairs director, George Munoz to lead the Overseas Private
Investment Corporation and Louis Caldera as secretary of the Army.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has spoken at the annual Congressional Hispanic Caucus
dinner in Washington, D.C., every year since he has been president.
When he proclaimed National Hispanic Heritage Month from Sept. 15
to Oct. 15, the president vowed to ``ensure that all Hispanic
American families have the tools and opportunities they need to
make the most of their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Following the GOP's lead, the Democratic National Committee in
May launched weekly Spanish-language broadcasts to appeal to
Hispanic audiences. The DNC hired communications expert Evangelina
Garcia as deputy press secretary to deal with Hispanic news
outlets.

 WASHINGTON:news outlets.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Committee also hired political consultant Armando Gutierrez,
based in Albuquerque, N.M., to bolster Hispanic voting in 13 House,
8 Senate and 6 gubernatorial races.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year congressional Democrats declared all-out war
on GOP lawmakers over Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   The House Democratic Policy Committee attacked what it called
the ``anti-Hispanic Republican Congress'' in a report denouncing
alleged GOP efforts to intimidate Hispanic voters, restrict access
to education, undercount minorities in the 2000 census and
eliminate the social safety net for legal immigrants. It also
attacked Republicans who are pressing for English-only legislation,
restrictions on immigration and an end to affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   Later, House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt notched up the
attack, calling the GOP ``the most anti-immigrant, the most
anti-Hispanic, party that has ever existed in the history of the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Both parties are calculating the importance of Hispanics based
on their skyrocketing growth.
</P>
<P>
   Now they make up 25.8 percent of California's population and
25.5 percent of that in Texas. The percentages are 38.2 percent in
New Mexico, 18.8 in Arizona, 12.9 in Colorado, 12.3 in New York,
12.2 in Florida, 9.6 in New Jersey, 7.9 in Illinois and 4.8 in
Massachusetts. These are the 10 states with 214 Electoral College
votes.
</P>
<P>
   By 2010, Hispanics are projected to be 37.8 percent of the
population in California, 32.5 percent in Texas, 42.3 percent in
New Mexico, 26.3 percent in Arizona, 19.1 percent in Florida, 18.1
percent in New York, 16.5 percent in Colorado, 15.6 percent in New
Jersey, 13.1 percent in Illinois and 9.6 percent in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Strategists in each party are also taking a second look at voter
turnout. Many politicians have long dismissed Hispanics as a group
that doesn't vote much.
</P>
<P>
   But that perception is based on the fact that for decades
analysts have compared the number of Hispanic voters with the
entire Hispanic voting-age population. Using that measure, only
26.7 percent of the Hispanic voting-age population cast ballots in
the 1996 presidential election, compared with a 54.2 percent total
turnout of the nation's voting-age population that year.
</P>
<P>
   However, the U.S. Census Bureau emphasizes _ and many
politicians now appreciate _ that the traditional gauge of Hispanic
political turnout is skewed. Census officials explain that about 40
percent of the 18.4 million Hispanics who were 18 or older in 1996
were ineligible to vote because they were not U.S. citizens.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, almost all of the 178.3 million non-Hispanic whites
and blacks of voting age in 1996 were U.S. born and eligible to
vote.
</P>
<P>
   To get a more accurate picture of turnout, The Hearst Newspapers
compared the number of actual voters with the number of registered
voters. Using that gauge, Hispanic voter participation is much
closer to that of the other groups: 75 percent of registered
Hispanic voters cast ballots in 1996, compared with 82.7 percent of
registered non-Hispanic white voters and 79.8 percent of black
voters.
</P>
<P>
   The turnout of registered Hispanic voters has exceeded the
turnout of registered African-American voters in three presidential
and three midterm elections since 1972.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the parties' greater interest in them, Hispanics are,
in turn, getting more involved in politics. This year a record
number are running _ 25 for the House, one for the Senate and 43
for statewide offices.
</P>
<P>
   Clara Rodriguez, a sociology professor at Fordham University in
New York City, says, ``There is a growing sense among Latinos that
we have been invisible for too long and it is important to stand up
and be counted.''
</P>
<P>
   Another boost to their political consciousness comes from
Hispanics' growing awareness of their impact on the 1996 election.
</P>
<P>
   They gave Bill Clinton 72 percent of their vote and Republican
Bob Dole only 21 percent. GOP nominees had long counted on at least
25 percent. President Ronald Reagan set the high-water mark with 37
percent of the Hispanic vote in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Exit polls on election day showed that Hispanics helped deliver
Arizona to Clinton _ the first time that a Democrat had carried the
state in 48 years. At the same time Cuban Americans broke ranks
with the GOP in Florida, splitting their vote between Clinton and
Dole. It was only the third time since 1964 that a Democrat was
able to capture the state. Mexican Americans tilted heavily toward
Clinton in New Mexico, helping him to win the state for a second
time.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanics themselves also scored dramatic gains across the
nation. The number elected to state legislatures grew by almost 20
percent to 131 lawmakers, according to the Los Angeles-based
National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials.
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead to the November election, a number of experts say
that Hispanic voters are not locked into one political party.
</P>
<P>
   Harry P. Pachon, head of the Tomas Rivera Policy Institute, a
nonpartisan think tank in Claremont, Calif., notes that many
Hispanics are first-time voters, having just turned 18 or just won
their citizenship. ``The roots of their partisan attachment are
very shallow,'' Pachon says. While Republicans' anti-immigrant
rhetoric ``pushed Latinos into the arms of the Democrats in 1996, I
don't know if that will be permanent.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, many Hispanics are taking a wait-and-see attitude.
Raul Yzaguirre, head of the National Council of La Raza, which
lobbies Congress and state legislatures on behalf of Hispanics,
charges that both parties' efforts are ``essentially public
relations,'' rather than policies targeted to the everyday lives of
Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Andrade, head of the U.S. Hispanic Leadership Institute in
Chicago, which has helped register 1.5 million new Hispanic voters
since 1982, says the parties ``need to do more work'' to win
Hispanics' attention and loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The parties and the politicians haven't sorted out their
strategies yet,'' says Andrade. ``For 30 years one party did not
want us, and the other party took us for granted.''

   BRIDGETOWN, Barbados _ Bajans, as people here like to be called,
have a sense of their own style. So much so that even McDonald's
couldn't invade the culture. The fast-food chain went bust after
just six months of operation because no one ate at the place.
</P>
<P>
   Barbados is different from some other Caribbean islands in that
things just seem to work better here. The roads are good, the
phones connect, and appointments are kept. And, the island is
infested by millionaires the way some are infested by mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
   Bajans will tell you that their country has been blessed by God,
and this is no idle boast.
</P>
<P>
   Barbados hasn't been touched by a hurricane since 1955 and the
sun shines nearly every day.
</P>
<P>
   But it's more than just that.
</P>
<P>
   Bajans (pronounced ``Bah-jonz'') are the most affluent and most
educated people in the Caribbean, and they have the highest
literacy rate _ nearly 98 percent _ in the English-speaking world.
</P>
<P>
   In the United Nations Development Program's annual ``human
development index'' that evaluates countries in terms of life
expectancy, income and education, Barbados ranks 24th, ahead of all
other Caribbean countries and even better than countries such as
Portugal, Luxembourg, and Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
   And if Barbados appears lacking in the vast poverty found on
other islands, it is because agriculture, commerce, and sugar cane
production provide most with work.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about their island's success, government officials
will say it's rooted in religion and a strong education system.
</P>
<P>
   The 166-square-mile island supports a population of 266,000
people and more churches than days in the year.
</P>
<P>
   One Pentecostal church holds five services each Sunday, all of
them packed with worshippers.
</P>
<P>
   It is also home to 125 religious sects, with everyone from
Baptists to Buddhists on the island.
</P>
<P>
   The island is divided into 11 parishes all named after a saint,
except for the parish called Christ Church.
</P>
<P>
   On Sundays, stores and businesses are closed. The radio
broadcasts almost 30 different religious programs. And, almost
everyone attends church as well as other gatherings such as gospel
concerts and prayer recitations.
</P>
<P>
   ``People go to church, and then they go home to eat and rest,
that's all,'' said Fran Evelyn, a tour operator. ``Everything's
closed because people consider Sunday to be a day of rest.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides religion, education also is serious stuff in Barbados,
and discipline is strongly enforced in the schools.
</P>
<P>
   If a student is bad, he or she might be paddled. Girls can't
wear makeup, flashy jewelry, or skirts above the knee. Boys can't
wear earrings or tattoos. Days begin and end with prayer. School
assemblies feature the reading of Bible passages and the telling of
stories about morality.
</P>
<P>
   Education is so highly valued here that the government spends
nearly a fifth of its budget on it every year, as is evident by the
computers that adorn most of the classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Even better, students have something to strive for because, if
grades are good, students can get a full scholarship to their
college of choice, no matter what country it is in.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel education should be made available free of charge to
anyone who wants it,'' said Glenroy Cumberbatch, deputy chief for
the Ministry of Education.
</P>
<P>
   Not that this island doesn't have its share of troubles.
Drug-related violence is up, and drug traffickers from South
America are increasingly using the island as a stepping-stone to
transport cocaine and heroin to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But, still, there are only nine or 10 murders here a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a very law-abiding society, so much so that police do
not even carry weapons,'' said Barbados Sen. Phillip Goddard.
``Parents instill in their children the importance of God and
education at a young age.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbados is a very British island, hence its nickname ``Little
England.''
</P>
<P>
   People here drink beer in pubs, watch cricket on the weekends,
drive on the left side of the road, and visit Trafalgar Square in
downtown Bridgetown, just as they do in London.
</P>
<P>
   The English settled here in 1625 and continued to rule for 339
years, until the island became independent in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bajans have certainly been influenced by the British culture,
even though today we are being increasingly influenced by the
United States through television programming and that sort of
thing,'' Goddard said.
</P>
<P>
   But compared to the United States, life here is delightfully
simple.
</P>
<P>
   Most houses in Barbados have no numbers, but are instead marked
only by names. For example, a house might be called something like
Comfort, or Woodlawn, or Henry's Place.
</P>
<P>
   With little crime, the newspaper's front page features stories
on things like the country's declining sheep industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we do so well because our temperament is good,'' said
Barbados Attorney General David Simmons. ``We think before we speak
and don't go in for excesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Excesses that seemingly include even Big Macs and
Quarter-Pounders. So much for American influences.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For Hispanics, the long march to political power
began shortly after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Like many Americans, tens of thousands of Hispanics who joined
the military found that the war had forever changed their outlook.
Sent to bases across the country and overseas, they saw a world
outside their barrios in the Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time, they were able to see how people lived and
were treated outside of California and Texas,'' says John Garcia,
an expert on Hispanic politics at the University of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   In those days Mexican Americans in Texas could not serve on
grand juries or draft boards, and most attended de facto segregated
schools. Many were refused service in restaurants, and few voted
because of a poll tax. In California, they found segregation _
except in housing _ less widespread, but discrimination was
rampant. ``Pachuco'' was a common epithet that they heard. It was
the equivalent of ``nigger'' or ``wop.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, thousands of Hispanic veterans took advantage of the G.I.
Bill and went to college, forming the nucleus of a small
professional class. Self-help groups sprang up. One was the
Community Service Organization (CSO), founded in 1947 in Los
Angeles to fight discrimination in the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   CSO quickly became involved in local politics. For example, it
conducted a strong voter registration drive that was key to the
election of Edward R. Roybal to the Los Angeles City Council in
1949. He was the first Mexican American elected to the council in
the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in Texas a physician named Hector Garcia and other
veterans in Corpus Christi had started the American GI Forum to
protect the rights of Mexican-American veterans.
</P>
<P>
   A 1949 incident in the town of Three Rivers, 65 miles northwest
of Corpus Christi, outraged Garcia and led him to launch a national
campaign against discrimination. Through his efforts, media from
around the country focused on Three Rivers, where a funeral home
director had refused to let the family of a deceased veteran, Felix
Longoria, hold a wake. As a result of the publicity, Longoria was
buried with honor in Arlington National Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican Americans, although shunned by Democratic and Republican
party bosses, continued to run for office during the 1950s. But
with little money, most of their campaigns failed.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the decade, some Hispanic leaders recognized that
their candidates needed more help from their own communities if
they were to succeed. So in 1959, 150 activists gathered in Los
Angeles and founded the Mexican American Political Association.
MAPA, which later established branches throughout the Southwest,
sought to get Mexican-American candidates from either party
elected.
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1960 the Viva Kennedy campaign began.
</P>
<P>
   Realizing that the election between Democrat John Kennedy and
Republican Richard Nixon was going to be close, Kennedy aides
fanned out in the Southwest setting up Viva Kennedy clubs to bring
out the Hispanic vote.
</P>
<P>
   On election day, these voters proved crucial to Kennedy's
victory in Texas. Some precincts in El Paso, for instance, went 100
percent for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the Anglo vote split fairly evenly in Texas, the Latino
vote carried the day for Kennedy,'' says Louis DeSipio of the
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, an expert on Hispanic
political movements.
</P>
<P>
   The next year Henry B. Gonzalez of San Antonio won a special
election to become the first Hispanic congressman in modern times.
In 1962 Roybal won a U.S. House seat from Los Angeles. The Senate
already had Dennis Chavez of New Mexico, who served from from 1935
to 1964, when he stepped down and was replaced by Joseph Montoya.
</P>
<P>
   While some Mexican Americans celebrated these victories, others,
particularly young people, charged that both the Democratic and
Republican parties were still refusing to back Hispanics
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The young activists tried a more confrontational approach. Some
pointed to the federal funds given to African Americans following
riots in black neighborhoods during the 1960s and argued that
Hispanics needed to use similar methods to attract national
attention and government aid.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most important groups formed in that period was La
Crusada Para La Justicia. Started in Denver in 1965 by Rodolfo
``Corky'' Gonzales, a poet and former boxing champion, the group
supported high school strikes, organized demonstrations against
police brutality and protested against the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   Many non-Hispanic whites saw Gonzales' organization as a
dangerous threat to society, but some militant Hispanics felt it
didn't go far enough.
</P>
<P>
   In 1967, Reies Tijerina and about 40 armed supporters took
control of the Rio Arriba County courthouse in the northern New
Mexico town of Tierra Amarilla. Tijerina released 11 prisoners who
had been arrested in connection with his plan to take over lands in
the Kit Carson National Forest.
</P>
<P>
   After a shootout with police, Tijerina and his supporters fled
into nearby mountains. Eventually, the National Guard captured him
and 17 of his supporters. He was later acquitted of the charges
resulting from the raid.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic militancy also was showing up in the political arena. In
1970, Jose Angel Gutierrez and other activists at St. Mary's
University in San Antonio founded a third party called La Raza
Unida. It sought to gain political control of Texas communities
with significant Mexican-American majorities.
</P>
<P>
   The LRU, which called for instruction in Spanish in all American
schools and increased government aid for the poor, found its
greatest success in Crystal City, about 100 miles southwest of San
Antonio. There, the party's candidates won control of the city
council and board of education in 1970. The LRU also managed to get
candidates elected in 22 Texas counties that year. Two years later,
an LRU candidate, Ramsey Muniz, ran for governor but won only about
6 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MORE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   During this time, Hispanics saw that unity was essential to
their advancement. An important example was a labor movement that
was reaching the peak of its power in the fields and orchards of
Central California.
</P>
<P>
   It had started in the early 1960s when Cesar Chavez, along with
Dolores Huerta and Gilbert Padilla, began to organize the area's
migrant workers, urging them to join their United Farm Workers
Union.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez had gained national attention in 1965 when he began La
Huelga (The Strike), which used nonviolent methods such as fasts
and boycotts of lettuce, grapes and wine to fight for the rights of
migrant laborers.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez also publicized the general plight of Mexican Americans
to the nation. His work was so well known that in 1968,
presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy met with him to discuss
working conditions for migrant workers.
</P>
<P>
   Many Hispanics regard Chavez as akin to Mohandas K. Gandhi in
India and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. in the United States
because of his belief that nonviolent protests could lead to social
change, according to Professor Garcia of the University of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chavez's work caused many Latinos to realize that something
could be done to help their community, which led many of them to
join political groups fighting for Latino rights,'' Garcia says.
</P>
<P>
   Although the militant groups captured much of the media's
attention in the late 1960s and early 1970s, other organizations
were started that quietly worked within the system.
</P>
<P>
   They sought to boost political awareness. Two of them, the
Southwest Voter Registration Project (SVRP) and the Mexican
American Legal Defense and Educational Fund (MALDEF), would prove
crucial to moving Hispanics into the mainstream of American
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Created in 1968, the SVRP sent representatives into Hispanic
communities throughout Texas and California, registering voters and
then seeing that they actually cast ballots.
</P>
<P>
   Formed later in 1968, MALDEF concentrated on legal battles over
boundaries of political districts and the rights of Hispanic
voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the SVRP and MALDEF got going, they become the most
important groups in Mexican American political history,'' says
Rodolfo de la Garza, a political science professor at the
University of Texas in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   But getting the SVRP going wasn't easy, says its president,
Antonio Gonzalez. The first SVRP volunteers who went into Hispanic
communities to register voters met a demoralized people who had
lost hope in the political system, Gonzalez explains, adding:
``There was a sense that you couldn't win. People thought a Mexican
American couldn't win an election. So why vote? But we just kept
pushing the line that if you participate, change will come. And it
did.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez says victories of Hispanic candidates throughout the
Southwest in the early and mid-1970s were a turning point.
``Nothing gets out the vote like winning,'' he notes.
</P>
<P>
   But Hispanic leaders also saw that they needed to attract more
attention in statehouses and in Washington, D.C. So the National
Council of La Raza was formed in 1968 to lobby Congress and state
governments on behalf of Hispanics. In 30 years, it has grown to
include 200 affiliates in 37 states.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, an older group, the League of United Latin American
Citizens (LULAC), gained new energy. Created in 1929, LULAC had
long fought for Hispanic rights in education, housing and the
workplace. By the late 1960s, the organization began serious
efforts to persuade different Hispanic ethnic groups to work
together.
</P>
<P>
   Then in the early 1970s some of the militant Hispanic groups
began to lose steam, weakened by internal dissent and a general
decline in minority rights movements. Many in the radical groups
``went to more mainstream groups,'' says DeSipio of the University
of Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he says, the Democratic and Republican parties
also began to recognize Hispanic voters as a growing force. By the
mid-1970s, Mexican Americans in California and Texas were seen as
important swing votes in statewide and presidential elections. In
South Florida, Cuban Americans were beginning their surge in local
and regional politics. In New York and New Jersey, candidates for
statewide office were starting to court Puerto Ricans.
</P>
<P>
   But while the Democrats and Republicans could no longer ignore
Hispanics as voters, Latino candidates still had to struggle for
major-party support.
</P>
<P>
   According to Garcia, the Democrats and Republicans were willing
to back Hispanic candidates in overwhelmingly Hispanic districts
but were reluctant to support them for wider offices.
</P>
<P>
   Those fighting for full support of Latino political candidates
finally saw victories in the late 1980s and early 1990s when
thousands of Hispanic candidates _ most of them Democrats _ began
to run for local, state and national offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the 1990s,'' says DeSipio, ``Latino candidates in the
Southwest were also being thought of for statewide offices, where
they needed a substantial amount on non-Latino voters to win.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the number of Hispanics elected to state offices
nationwide increased 28 percent from 1989 to 1994, growing from 133
to 184. And from 1989 to 1996, the number of Hispanic members of
Congress rose from 10 to 18.
</P>
<P>
   The increase, and especially the rise of Hispanic candidates
``in places you wouldn't expect it ... is really a sign of
success,'' says Selena Walsh, director of policy and communications
for LULAC. ``In many ways, it's a sign of political maturity.''

 &HT;    E. coli's long-term effects remain difficult to assess
 &HT;    By Patricia Guthrie and Virginia Anderson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Predicting long-term health for survivors of severe
cases of E. coli O157:H7 is not easy. And the reasons seem
contradictory.
</P>
<P>
   While the potentially killer organism is now viewed as
widespread _ showing up in more places _ it hasn't been around long
enough to give doctors hard and fast data. It wasn't until the Jack
in the Box outbreak in 1993, that sickened more than 700 people
over four states, that scientists accelerated their research.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent study of E. coli survivors has just been
published in the medical journal Pediatric Nephrology. Specialists
at Seattle's Children's Hospital and Medical Center are tracking 29
Washington children who became severely ill after eating Jack in
the Box hamburgers. All suffered hemolytic uremic syndrome, or HUS,
which can lead to temporary kidney failure, and can cause havoc in
other organs.
</P>
<P>
   The findings so far? Better than expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pleasantly surprised by how well all of them are
doing,'' said Dr. John Brandt, a pediatric nephrologist. ``But at
the same time, we're cautiously optimistic about how they'll be
doing in 10, 20 and 30 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 29 patients, some of whom are now teenagers, none has
required kidney transplants, the gloomiest forecast put forth five
years ago. Eight show signs of kidney abnormality, such as blood or
protein in their urine, Brandt said, but their kidneys are
continuing to filter and function normally.
</P>
<P>
   The most serious condition noted was gallstones. Three children
had surgery to remove their gallbladders.
</P>
<P>
   However, more serious complications may still unfold.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we still don't know about HUS is this: How much residual
injury are you left with? Kids might be better right now, but we
still don't know what happens to them down the road,'' says Brandt,
who teaches and practices at the University of New Mexico Health
Sciences Center. ``It's everyone's concern they might suffer
permanent kidney failure, but it's not yet proven.''
</P>
<P>
   While none of the Washington children needed a kidney
transplant, an Idaho teenager did. She is the only one so far of
the Jack in the Box outbreak known to have permanent renal failure,
said Bruce Clark, an attorney who formerly sat on the defense
corporate side of E. coli cases but now represents plaintiffs suing
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Predicting the long-term health of E. coli victims is not only a
medical concern but also a legal one.
</P>
<P>
   In the past five years, several multimillion-dollar settlements
have been paid out by food product insurance companies for numerous
young victims who may face a lifetime of health and wage-earning
complications.
</P>
<P>
   While some kids end up with relatively minor afflictions such as
chronic anemia and hypertension, others face deterioration of the
major organs and learning disabilities caused by central nervous
system trauma.
</P>
<P>
   Shelby Hotz, a kindergartner in Petaluma, Calif., just underwent
a kidney transplant, four years after she survived an E. coli
illness that also sickened her cousin, Jennifer Joseph. Both
suffered HUS and both underwent dialysis, but Shelby's condition
worsened, requiring two months of intensive care. Twenty months old
at the time, Shelby seemed to be recovering well until November,
when her kidney function rapidly declined.
</P>
<P>
   Now 5, she received one of her mother's kidneys during a
transplant in March. ``The kidney is not perfect. It's too big for
her and it bulges out on her one side,'' said Shelby's mother,
Catherine Hotz. ``But there's no signs of rejection so far. But
she'll have to undergo this same surgery again. The kidney could
last 30 years or it could last for five or 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hotz family is suing Costco, where the tainted frozen
hamburger patties were purchased. Medical costs of the transplant
surgery and aftercare have topped $225,000, said the family's
Seattle lawyer, William Marler. Frequent colds and infections,
respiratory problems, nightmares and panic attacks are just a few
of the physical and emotional scars parents say their children have
suffered in the years following severe E. coli O157 attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Dillon Land, 10, of Lubbock, Texas, has particularly rough
nights. That's when he seems most gripped by the memories of the
illness that kept him in a Dallas hospital for Christmas, New
Year's Day and his seventh birthday. He suffered severe
pancreatitis, liver damage and was strapped to a dialysis machine
for a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``It terrifies him when he gets sick,'' said his mother, Lisa
Land. ``One night last week he woke up with a cough, and he
couldn't breathe because he was having a panic attack.''
</P>
<P>
   For Elizabeth Tikriti, 7, of Yakima, Wash., her memories of
starting first grade will always be shaded by being hospitalized
for E. coli a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``An event like that just rips you,'' said her mother, Sarah
Tikriti. ``We all grow up thinking the world is a pretty safe
place, but her view of the world is a little different now. Her
fear of being ill is huge.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors did not give Elizabeth any pain medication because it
would slow down her diarrhea, which was vital to eliminating the E.
coli from her body. She lay writhing in a hospital bed, doubled
over for hours each day, her mother recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the most active illness I've ever seen, it's like they
are in labor,'' Tikriti said. Her daughter still sees a kidney
specialist, but is doing well for now. The mothers said they would
like to help parents of other children who have suffered HUS and to
alert the public to the dangers of E. coli. In many cases, their
kids are best at telling it like it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elizabeth knows a lot about E. coli,'' Tikriti said. ``She's
the first to walk up to someone eating pink hamburger meat and say,
`Do you know what you're doing?'''

 &HT;    Aftermath of Seattle's miracle: Surviving E. coli
 &HT;    By Patricia Guthrie
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Of all the reminders of fate and the future, the
yellow school bus seemed most cruel.
</P>
<P>
   Every morning, Suzanne Kiner looked out the hospital window
above her 10-year-old daughter's bed and watched the bus roll past.
Past the threadbare trees of winter, down the hill, through the
intersection. Every morning, it evoked the same dreaded question:
Would my youngest daughter ever ride a school bus again?
</P>
<P>
   The answer, 5 1/2 years ago, was no. At least that was the
thinking of the legions of doctors at Seattle Children's Hospital
and Medical Center who tended to her daughter Brianne, one of
dozens of children felled by the E. coli outbreak of 1993 that was
traced to Jack in the Box restaurants. Four of them died.
</P>
<P>
   Critically ill and in a coma, Brianne was not expected to live.
Major organs _ her heart, her lungs, her kidneys _ were tethered to
three racks of steel machines, surrounding her like a sci-fi
fortress. So many tubes and monitors had to be stuck into so many
places of her slight 4-foot-2 frame that one tube was attached to
her left big toe with a pink bandage. A ghastly incision seared her
from bellybutton to breastbone, where surgeons had removed her
entire large intestine to prevent it from rupturing and spreading
more germs.
</P>
<P>
   But she was alive.
</P>
<P>
   And that seemed, for the moment, enough.
</P>
<P>
   Suzanne needed to stay focused on the task at hand. Keep her
alive. Get Brianne through another day. Make sure all that's being
done continues to be done.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to lose her to something stupid, to some order
not being followed or the wrong tube being put in or something like
that,'' she thought, gently smoothing back Brianne's hair. As
always, it was clean and shiny, the lovely touch of Noel, the night
nurse who washed it every evening, then tied it back in bright
hospital crinkle tape.
</P>
<P>
   Suzanne leaned down and whispered a mother's mantra in her
daughter's ear, the same simple words she repeated daily: ``Every
day, I'm getting better and stronger. Every day.''
</P>
<P>
   After nearly six weeks in a coma, Brianne Kiner did wake up. She
did get better and stronger and healthier. It started with baby
steps in Minnie Mouse socks and shoes during daily physical therapy
sessions and continues to this day in horse arenas,
neuropsychologists' and medical doctors' offices, and with a small
battalion of other therapists and tutors.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Brianne started attending a local school for the
first time since her illness. Finally, after five long years of
rehabilitation, some semblance of normalcy finally is within reach.
</P>
<P>
   This is the story of the aftermath of a miracle. It is not all
happy. It is not simple.
</P>
<P>
   And it is far from over.
</P>
<P>
   Brianne, now 15, is the sickest person in the country ever to
survive E. coli O157:H7, the bacteria that forever changed the
lives of more than two dozen families whose children swam at White
Water park in Marietta on four days this summer.
</P>
<P>
   What doctors learned in treating Brianne and others in the
Seattle outbreak has helped other children survive the virulent
bug, which is creeping into an alarming variety of plates and
places: Hamburgers, apple juice, coleslaw, swimming pools, day-care
centers and state fairs.
</P>
<P>
   Since Brianne's ordeal, the Kiners frequently have spoken out in
favor of tougher food safety regulations, and they're regularly
contacted by worried parents when a new E. coli outbreak unfolds.
In June, Suzanne Kiner flew to Atlanta after the White Water
outbreak to advise and comfort the family of 2-year-old McCall
Akin, the Kennesaw toddler who ultimately lost her battle against
the deadly toxin.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows exactly why Brianne is alive today, let alone
healthy enough to ride a horse. It could be the extraordinary
medical care she received; it could be her body was stronger
because she was older than the other children who died.
</P>
<P>
   Or it could be as simple as the homemade sign that hung above
her hospital bed: ``Expect a Miracle.''
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, the miracle was the easy part.
</P>
<P>
   Brianne's kidneys still could fail, and her adult life could
include dialysis machines, donor matches and multiple kidney
transplants. She could have other physical complications that
doctors cannot predict because the overall long-term effects of the
bacterium remain unknown.
</P>
<P>
   This much, however, is known: She shouldn't get pregnant because
it would overwhelm her kidneys, scarred abdomen and circulatory
system; her pancreas never will recover, so she'll always be a
diabetic; and more surgeries are inevitable to monitor and repair
her fragile gastrointestinal tract.
</P>
<P>
   Also unfolding are the emotional and neurological traumas, the
result of multiple seizures and strokes, and the visions and voices
she experienced during a long coma that took her so many times to
many inexplicable edges.
</P>
<P>
   ``She told me once, `I need so much,''' Suzanne Kiner said one
day while looking through drawers full of old newspaper articles on
the outbreak and legal settlement. ``She knows that. But she's also
experienced so many things most adults cannot even fathom. At
times, she seems so old.''
</P>
<P>
   In medical circles, Brianne is regarded as an ``outlier,'' a
patient who doesn't fit into any law of averages or expectations.
She survived the longest and most brutal attack known of hemolytic
uremic syndrome, or HUS, a disease caused by E. coli. It shredded
</P>
<P>
   her red blood cells, which in turn formed gummy clots throughout
her kidneys, heart, lungs and central nervous system.
</P>
<P>
   ``When she was comatose for so long, we really didn't think
she'd make it,'' says Dr. David Jardine, associate director of the
pediatric intensive care unit where Brianne spent two months.
``When she started out, she wasn't the sickest of the (E. coli)
kids here. But unfortunately, she got sicker and sicker.''
</P>
<P>
   As the bacteria passed through her intestines and into her
bloodstream, it blew out vessels, causing massive hemorrhaging.
</P>
<P>
   ``She bled from every orifice,'' recalls her 50-year-old mother.
``And not just once but many, many times. She suffered three
strokes, 10,000 seizures, and every single one of her organs
failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you how many times I was told by doctors, `You've
got 15 minutes left''' to say goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   As with all E. coli patients, doctors could provide only
supportive care with dialysis machines, ventilators, intravenous
feeding and other cleansing and nutritional devices. They could not
treat the disease; nothing but time rids the body of the E. coli
O157: H7 strain.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, time is what healed Brianne. Conserving every ounce
of energy, her body shut down and lapsed into unconsciousness. Her
hair fell out. Fingernails stopped growing. Her skin cracked and
split open. All day, all night, her naked body lay open like a
wound. She was not allowed to wear hospital gowns because doctors
needed instant access when her heart stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, a tear rolled down Brianne's cheek.
</P>
<P>
   ``You try and tell yourself your child is not in pain. She's
shut down. She's unconscious,'' Suzanne Kiner says, recalling the
image as if it were yesterday. ``But she's crying. In her sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bri's blown past all expectations, there's no question about
that,'' says Gayle Fay, a clinical neuropsychologist who has
tracked Brianne's educational and emotional progress since she
returned home in June 1993. ``E. coli is a disease that affects
multiple systems, so her brain is certainly also going to be
affected. There was definite concern about her brain function
during her coma. . . . In a sense, this is a fairly new frontier.''
Brianne recently began ninth grade at the prestigious Seattle
Academy of Arts and Sciences, a sixth- through 12th-grade private
school that only admitted eight new freshmen to the class of 2002.
It's the first time since her illness that she has been learning in
a setting not devoted to special-needs kids.
</P>
<P>
   It's exciting. It's exhilarating. It's exhausting.
</P>
<P>
   ``She came home the first day so excited, she was just
beaming,'' Suzanne Kiner says. ``Then, the second morning, she was
so tired. But she got up on time and dragged herself downstairs,
and I took one look at her and told her to go back up and sleep for
another hour. She looked terrible, white, pale from exhaustion.
Well, she slept another five hours. I couldn't wake her up. The
third day went better.''
</P>
<P>
   Into her fourth week, Brianne says she's adjusted to the routine
of her classes, and to the rhythm of her 71 classmates. ``There's
really nice groups of kids, but I'm not sure I'm up to their
standards yet to be their friends,'' she says in her best sarcastic
tone. ``As far as the classes, I like history the best because
we're going to be studying a little bit of Japanese and Chinese
culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Brianne has attended therapeutic and academic classes at a
variety of private institutions, including Desert Hills, a
psychiatric center in Phoenix, and New Mexico's Brush Ranch School
for neurologically challenged children. In the past two years, she
has caught up on reading, math and the sciences. With a team of
teachers and therapists, Brianne has been kept so busy six days a
week that her mother hired an assistant to help with the
scheduling, paying the piles of bills and the driving here and
there to appointments.
</P>
<P>
   It's been a long haul of learning to walk again, to talk again,
to regain what a series of strokes and seizures and a savage germ
had stolen.
</P>
<P>
   She scored in the 98th percentile in recent scholastic
evaluation tests and is considered ``above average'' in most
academic categories. As her mom puts it: ``Not bad for someone who
was `brain dead.''' One of her favorite activities is creative
writing, and she's a whiz with computers, the Internet and all
things electronic.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, she writes about some of the medical drama she's
been through but mostly she keeps it to herself. ``I don't talk
about it unless someone asks about my diabetes, or why I can't take
gym or if they're curious about something,'' Brianne says. ``Most
kids my age don't remember the outbreak, but their parents usually
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Brianne is vigilant at monitoring her blood-sugar levels and
giving herself daily insulin shots. Her seizure disorder seems to
have settled down, but she takes anti-convulsant medication,
Neurontin, because scans still show abnormal brain waves. She also
takes Prilosec, which relieves the high levels of stomach acid, a
result of the E. coli burning out her stomach lining.
</P>
<P>
   Because of gastrointestinal damage, Brianne must avoid certain
foods, but it doesn't keep her away from hamburgers. (She admits to
eating burgers at nearly all the joints, but she would ``never go
near a Jack in the Box, even though it's probably now the safest
one of them all.'') ``I just make sure the burgers I eat are
thoroughly cooked,'' she says with an an all-knowing, no-big-deal
kind of adolescent shrug.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes her voice still lowers to a rough whisper, the result
of being on a respirator for so long. She also needed asthma
medication for several years following her illness, but her lung
capacity has improved, though strenuous aerobic exercise may remain
forever beyond her capability.
</P>
<P>
   Despite it all, slumber parties, field trips, learning to drive
(``Please, Mom, let me at least steer!'') and working on the school
yearbook await the teenager, whose plight years earlier prompted
strangers to post signs around Seattle pleading: Pray for Brianne.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot remember anything about being sick,'' she says one
evening over Japanese soba noodles at a favorite restaurant near
her home. ``It's probably a good thing, too. I don't even remember
the Christmas before I got sick or even eating the hamburgers at
Jack in the Box.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors believe Brianne got a double dose of E. coli because she
ate kiddie-size cheeseburgers twice at the same neighborhood Jack
in the Box within one week. Washington health officials later found
that the restaurant was not grilling the burgers long enough, a
practice immediately corrected after the E. coli outbreak of 1993,
which sickened 732 people in four states, killed four children and
triggered 55 HUS cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do know when I was getting better in the hospital, it was
the longest period my parents didn't fight. . . . Maybe that's why
God put me through all this pain, maybe so they would realize they
couldn't be together anymore. They're both much happier now.''
</P>
<P>
   Brianne's ordeal finally broke the already fractured marriage of
her parents, Suzanne and Rex Kiner. In December 1996, they divorced
after 27 years of marriage. Rex Kiner kept the family home in the
Seattle suburb of Redmond, now shared with his second wife. Suzanne
Kiner and Brianne moved into a two-story brick home in north
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Brianne's two older sisters, Kristine and Karin, teens at the
time of her illness, suffered the roller-coaster emotional strains
of a near death in the family and losing their mother to a
seven-day-a-week hospital vigil.
</P>
<P>
   Both sisters experienced bouts of depression, guilt and anger.
</P>
<P>
   Karin missed so much of her sophomore year in high school that
she opted to drop her advanced college-prep classes. Her grades
took a nosedive. Now 21, she is a single mom raising a 1-year-old
daughter. Kristine, 24, is continuing her graduate studies in
classical music and plays oboe in concerts.
</P>
<P>
   Suzanne still suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder. She
also suffers the very present stress that is known by the full name
of Sara Brianne Kiner.
</P>
<P>
   Brianne has grown into a typical teenager. She loves / loathes
her mom. Defiant, she talks back, flashes an impolite hand gesture,
and slams her bedroom door. ``You've violated my space, Mom. I told
you I didn't want you showing anyone my room, Mom. What about the
boundaries you're always telling me about?''
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, she curls up on the couch like a 5-year-old,
snuggling into her mother's shoulder, resisting waking up and being
shuttled to another round of appointments.
</P>
<P>
   Today's schedule: Charlotte, her reading coach; Snoopy, her
horse; then a facial in the well-scrubbed suburb of Edmonds.
</P>
<P>
   Every appointment, every trip, every purchase promotes Brianne's
health, education or welfare, the stipulation of her trust fund set
up in February 1995, when Foodmaker Inc., the parent company of
Jack in the Box, settled her negligence and medical claims case for
$15.6 million. The largest personal injury case ever in Washington,
it was negotiated by William Marler, a Seattle personal injury
plaintiff attorney who has gone on to represent many other E. coli
victims, including four of those sickened at Marietta's White Water
park.
</P>
<P>
   Buying and learning to ride a thoroughbred was a sneaky way of
incorporating Brianne's physical therapy into the routine. She
needed to continue strengthening her left side, damaged by a
stroke. ``Grooming and training her horse also focuses her
attention on something, someone, other than herself,'' her mom
whispers one morning just out of her daughter's earshot.
</P>
<P>
   Even as she lays down under the bright lights and soothing
aromas of Susan Lindsey's facial machine at the Edmonds Skin Care
office, Brianne's rehab continues. Lindsey specializes in helping
those suffering from burns and other trauma, giving them boosts of
self-confidence along with makeup tips.
</P>
<P>
   Tugging gently on the rein, Brianne Kiner stands in front of her
thoroughbred, encouraging the horse to circle left, then right.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's it, Snoopy,'' she coos in the low, loving voice she
reserves for all her animal companions: cats, kittens and a
brown-and-white-swirled guinea pig named Hershey Hugs. ``Here's
another carrot. And a Life Saver.''
</P>
<P>
   A red Life Saver quickly disappears amid the movement of a big
brown horse nose. ``He loves Life Savers,'' says the teenager,
still too fresh in her reclaimed world to understand the irony of
this moment. ``I don't know why. But Life Savers are his favorite
treat.''

TEXAS AND CALIF. GOVERNORS SEND MIXED MESSAGES TO HISPANICS

<TEXT>
<P>
   DEL RIO, Texas _ In a crowded South Texas shelter, Gov. George
W. Bush makes his way across the room shaking hands, providing
reassuring hugs and offering words of comfort to shaken flood
victims who lost everything.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, an elderly woman, hard of hearing, cries gently
when Bush greets her, overwhelmed by the moment. And when a
reporter wonders if someone could ask her in Spanish for her name,
it's Bush who obliges, bending down close to her ear and asking
loudly: ``Como se llama?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very nice of him to come here and care for the people. I
think it shows his humanity,'' comments Diane Ortiz, another flood
victim, as she watches the emotional scene.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's recent trip to this border town wasn't out of the
ordinary _ governors routinely visit disaster areas to console
victims and survey damage. But the warm welcome he received
demonstrates the Republican governor's popularity among Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   Some of them say he is more sympathetic to their concerns than
some other Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   California's Republican governor, Pete Wilson, for instance, has
incurred the wrath of many Hispanics with his harsh stances on
immigration and affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   The two men's differences illustrate the mixed messages the
Republican Party sends to the Hispanic community, a growing voting
force in both states.
</P>
<P>
   The two have taken disparate political paths.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, who cannot run for re-election because of term limits,
supported Proposition 187, a measure that would deny most public
services to undocumented immigrants. A federal judge blocked the
measure after it was approved by voters, and Wilson has appealed
the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has said repeatedly he would oppose a similar effort in
Texas, and he is against attempts to make English the nation's
official language, preferring what he calls ``English-plus''
programs. He supports efforts to stem the tide of illegal
immigration but is against the idea of installing a fence or wall
along the U.S.-Mexico border, as some Republicans have advocated.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson also supported propositions halting bilingual education
in schools and ending many state affirmative action programs. Bush
opposes quotas but has backed bilingual education so long as
proponents can show that the programs work.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson did not respond to interview requests for this story.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor routinely stresses the importance of strong
ties with Mexico, often plays host to Mexican officials and endears
himself to his neighbors to the South by trying _ and often
succeeding _ to talk to them in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   While others may draw dramatic distinctions between the two GOP
governors, Bush declines to make comparisons or pass judgment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to get into a debate with Governor Wilson,'' he
said in a recent interview in Austin. ``He's a friend of mine and I
like him. He made decisions that he thought were right for his
state and I made decisions I thought were right for Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bush also said the GOP needs to do more to attract Hispanic
voters. ``And I hope to show how to. I'm working hard to send a
message that ... says, `You're a part of the future.' He says his
``leadership style ... has been to unite people rather than divide
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who is running for re-election this fall against
Democratic Land Commissioner Garry Mauro, has maintained
double-digit leads over him in state polls.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro has had overwhelming support in past elections in the
Hispanic community, and he is counting on it this time. But Bush's
camp believes the incumbent can make inroads. Some even talk about
Bush getting 40 percent of the Hispanic vote, compared with 24
percent four years ago. Mauro rejects that prediction.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile in California, some Republicans worry about the
fallout among Hispanics from Wilson's stands on immigration and
affirmative action. Some analysts say an increase in Hispanic
political activism in California may be the deciding factor in key
elections this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly, Democrats are hoping Hispanic voters will aid them
in winning back the governorship.
</P>
<P>
   But the GOP isn't conceding the Hispanic community to the
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Hernandez, a visiting political science professor at St.
Mary's University in San Antonio, says, ``For the most part,
Republican candidates who have done well (with Hispanics) have been
moderate Republicans who have been supportive of a number of issues
_ they don't go out of their way to bash immigration, they make
education a major priority and they don't run as Republicans in the
Hispanic community. They run as individuals (or) they run as
Republicans who aren't as bad as the other guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you'll see (some California GOP candidates making) a
lot of comparisons to Wilson, who has some of the highest negatives
in the Hispanic community. They'll say they're not like him. His
position is clearly viewed as anti-immigrant among Hispanic
voters.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez said Bush's stands on issues important to Hispanics
may serve him well on election day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's doing well. ... He is a moderate in our
community,'' the professor said. ``He's been right on enough issues
that people are predispositioned to give him a fair hearing. He'll
probably get 35 percent (of the Hispanic vote) when (other GOP
candidates) will get 20 or 15 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   In California, Dick Dresner, a Republican consultant who worked
for Wilson, staunchly defends him, saying: ``I don't think the
governor did any of those things to punish Hispanic voters. It was
a matter of fairness.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Dresner conceded that the passage of the propositions on
affirmative action and undocumented immigrants has cost the
Republican Party votes in the Hispanic community.
</P>
<P>
   ``If (the propositions) hadn't happened, yeah, we'd be talking
about winning the Hispanic vote,'' said Dresner, who is working for
Dan Lungren, the GOP nominee for California governor.
</P>
<P>
   Reggie Bashur, a GOP consultant in Austin, says he thinks other
Republicans should follow Governor Bush's lead in dealing with
Hispanics. ``He clearly understands the importance of Hispanics,''
said Bashur, who once worked for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican Party, whether it be in Texas or California,
needs to embrace inclusion,'' Bashur added. ``The Hispanic vote is
critically important both in Texas and California, and policies
shouldn't be offered that alienate (Hispanics) or punish or just
make no sense. ... We have to open the party if we want to become
the majority party.''

HISPANIC LEADERS FLOURISH IN TEXAS POLITICS 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ A glance at the not-so-distant past illustrates
the headway Hispanics have made in Texas politics.
</P>
<P>
   In a historic election, Henry Cisneros became San Antonio's
first Hispanic mayor IN 1981 _ and the first Hispanic to lead a
major U.S. city. San Antonio had long been controlled by an elite
group of Anglo power brokers, but Hispanics made their voices
heard, with Cisneros getting an incredible 90 percent of their
votes.
</P>
<P>
   Today, their voices are being heard around Texas, from city
halls to the Capitol in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   In San Antonio, Hispanics hold a majority six seats on the
10-member city council. McAllen and El Paso have Hispanic mayors,
and Hispanics hold a majority on the Corpus Christi City Council.
</P>
<P>
   On up the political ladder, Richard Raymond, a Mexican American,
is the Democratic nominee for Texas land commissioner, and Tony
Garza is the Republican candidate for a spot on the Texas Railroad
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the early '90s, we referred to the Mexican-American
community as a sleeping giant,'' said Jerry Polinard, a political
science professor at the University of Texas in Edinburg. ``It is
still a giant. It's just no longer sleeping,''
</P>
<P>
   Hispanics' increasing political clout is evident even in the
governor's race, where Republican incumbent Gov. George W. Bush has
launched an expensive television campaign in Spanish and English to
try to pull Hispanic votes from Democratic opponent Garry Mauro.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and other Republican candidates have been beating a path to
areas rich in Hispanic votes, while Democrats are working hard to
maintain Hispanics' traditional ballot-box loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, Bush and Mauro had their only televised debate
Friday in the border city of El Paso, which is 70 percent Hispanic.
The candidates for lieutenant governor _ Republican Rick Perry and
Democrat John Sharp _ also chose El Paso for their only debate.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1970s, there were some 700 elected Hispanic
officials in Texas. Today, about 2,400 Hispanics occupy the
estimated 6,000 elected posts.
</P>
<P>
   And the potential for further gains looms large.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of sheer numbers, Hispanics have a huge opportunity to
influence Texas politics for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mexican-American population is growing _ the
Mexican-American educated population is growing,'' Polinard noted.
``With education comes a greater propensity to vote, and with
voting comes political power, particularly when you have the
numbers on your side.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of both parties recognize the importance that Hispanic
voters could have on this election and future ones. Republicans
have been making significant strides toward becoming the clear
majority party in Texas, but they need to win over more Hispanic
voters if they want to clinch that coveted role.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats once had an ironclad hold on government _ from the
county courthouses to the governor's mansion. But their power is
eroding, and Hispanics are vital to the party's survival in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   A generation can make a world of difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Texas was just a Democratic state, no one paid much
attention to the Mexican-American vote because it didn't really
matter,'' Polinard said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But with the emergence of the Republican Party, Democrats have
increasingly had to rely on the Mexican-American vote to win,'' he
added. ``South Texas holds the key to whether a Democrat can win a
statewide race, and Mexican-Americans hold the key to South
Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Roy Casanova, a one-time Democrat who is now legislative
director of the Republican National Hispanic Assembly, a
conservative advocacy group, said the GOP is trying to make inroads
into that heavily Democratic territory but conceded it is a major
mountain to climb.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be the Republican Party wrote off anything south of
San Antonio and gave it to the Democrats,'' he said. But in the
last 10 years, that has changed, and we're intent on changing it to
the point where the people of South Texas are offered a choice,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Garza, the GOP's railroad commission nominee, is an example of
that effort. He was the first Republican judge in Cameron County in
South Texas but in 1994 lost out in the crowded GOP primary for
attorney general, giving Democrats fodder at the time to say that
Hispanics were not welcome in the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in 1995 he became Gov. George W. Bush's first appointee _ as
secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans concede that policies they have supported on
immigration and bilingual education have hurt them in gaining
Hispanic support. But they are trying to downplay those stances to
broaden their support.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro, currently the Texas land commissioner, knows the value of
the Hispanic vote to him _ and his party. He has carried that vote
in his previous races, and he is counting on it in his uphill fight
against Bush, who is nearly 50 points ahead of him in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hispanic vote is key to whichever party survives,'' Mauro
said.
</P>
<P>
   A recent U.S. Census Bureau report said that Hispanics are the
fastest-growing ethnic group in the state. Texas, with 5.7 million
Hispanics, ranks second to California.
</P>
<P>
   At last count, there were 1.5 million registered Hispanics
voters in Texas, said Andy Hernandez, a visiting political science
professor at St. Mary's University in San Antonio. Hernandez, a
former president of the Southwest Voter Registration and Education
Project, said the organization predicts the number will be about
1.8 million by the Nov. 3 election.
</P>
<P>
   If that projection becomes reality, he added, the number of
Hispanics who cast ballots could total as much as 20 percent of the
overall vote, up from 16 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   By 2025, Hispanics are expected to total 38 percent of the Texas
population of 27.2 million. An estimated 3.8 million Hispanics will
be of voting age, which would be about 27 percent of all Texans of
voting age.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Hernandez said, ``Hispanics are having more of an
impact in state races. They're winning more city council races and
they're having an influence in the mega-cities such as San Antonio,
Dallas, Houston _ the cities that will determine the future of
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a cumulative effect in terms of Hispanic voters being
able to influence elections and being at the table where the
decisions are made and being able to put forward an agenda that
other people have to respond to,'' he said.

HISPANIC CANDIDATES RUN FAR FROM TRADITIONAL STRONGHOLDS

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ From the streets of Salt Lake City to the lake
lands of Minnesota, Hispanic candidates are running for office in
state and congressional races that would have seemed almost
impossible for them to enter only a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In Utah, Lily Eskelsen, a Democrat of Panamanian descent, is in
a tight struggle for the state's second congressional district seat
_ covering Salt Lake City _ against Republican Rep. Merrill Cook.
</P>
<P>
   ``Utah is not the first place people expect a Latina
candidate,'' Eskelsen says. But being Hispanic has been a major
asset to her campaign, she insists. ``Salt Lake City is becoming a
diverse city, and the voters are looking for someone who can deal
with the city's different communities.''
</P>
<P>
   She says her district's Hispanics, who make up 5 percent of its
population, could be the deciding factor in the race, which
currently is too close to call. The district's non-Hispanic voters
are evenly split between the two candidates, and Eskelsen says,
``Right now, I'm doing very well with Latino voters.''
</P>
<P>
   Eskelsen is not alone in her quest. Throughout the country,
Hispanic politicians are running for offices that are far from
their traditional strongholds. This development comes at a time
when more Hispanics are running for national and statewide posts
generally _ 25 for the House of Representatives, one for the Senate
and 43 for state offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're seeing is unprecedented,'' says Rosalind Gold, a
spokeswoman for the National Association of Latino Elected and
Appointed Officials. Referring to those running in areas where few
Hispanic voters live, she said, ``We see this as a watershed.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Eskelsen, Edwina Garcia, who seeks to become secretary of
state in Minnesota, is running in a place with few Hispanics. They
make up only 1.2 percent of the state's population., Garcia, a
Democratic state representative from Richfield, faces Republican
Mary Kiffmeyer of Big Lake, who helps run a medical service
company.
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas, Democrat Tom Sawyer, whose mother is Mexican
American, is running for governor against Republican Gov. Bill
Graves. In that state's race for senator, Democratic state Sen.
Paul Feleciano Jr., a Puerto Rican, is in an uphill fight against
incumbent Republican Sen. Sam Brownback.
</P>
<P>
   Feleciano says the fact that he and Sawyer are running ``has
given Hispanics here a message of hope and a sense of
empowerment.''
</P>
<P>
   In other statewide races, Republican Santa Mendoza is seeking to
become Connecticut attorney general, and Republican Eduardo Lopez
is running for Rhode Island secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
   In Illinois, Cook County Treasurer Miriam Santos, a Democrat,
faces a stiff battle against incumbent Republican Jim Ryan for
state attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   And in states where Hispanics have traditionally been strong
locally, more are running for higher office.
</P>
<P>
   In California, for instance, former speaker of the state
Assembly, Democrat Cruz Bustamante, is running for lieutenant
governor. Republican Ruben Barrales, a son of immigrants from
Mexico and a member of the San Mateo Board of Supervisors, is
running for comptroller. Democrat Diane Martinez hopes to become
insurance commissioner, and Republican Gloria Matta Tuchman is
seeking the nonpartisan post of superintendent of public
instruction.
</P>

   Hispanics running for office elsewhere include Democrat Martin
Chavez, who is running for governor of New Mexico; Democrat Ken
Salazar, who is seeking the post of attorney general of Colorado,
and Republican Tony Garza, who is running for a Texas railroad
commission seat.

candidates, 9 are Republicans and 16 are Democrats.

   Arturo Vargas, executive director of the National Association of
Latino Elected and Appointed Officials, says these candidates ``are
experienced public servants who have demonstrated to everybody that
they are not just people for our ethnic group.''

   The key to winning in predominately non-Hispanic districts,
according to a number of the Hispanic politicians running in those
areas, is to stick to the issues.

<P>
   Garcia of Minnesota says the voters ``want somebody who will get
the job done and work on things that people care about in their
neighborhoods.''
</P>
<P>
   Eskelsen adds that she has seen little difference in the issues
that concern Hispanic and non-Hispanic voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Surprise, surprise,'' she says. ``Latino families are worried
about education, Social Security and crime _ the exact same things
that other people are worried about.''

 (For release Tuesday, Oct. 13)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republicans and Democrats both claim that Hispanics
naturally fit into their camp.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats point to recent elections _ most notably President
Clinton's victory in 1996 with 72 percent of the Hispanic vote.
</P>
<P>
   However, Republicans say most Cuban Americans continue to be
steadfast members of their party and contend that the GOP's focus
on family values, religion and work ethic will eventually draw more
Hispanics to their side.
</P>
<P>
   Neither party is right, says John Garcia, a professor at the
University of Arizona who contributed to the book ``Latino Voices:
Mexican, Puerto Rican and Cuban Perspectives on American
Politics.''
</P>
<P>
   He and others warn that Hispanics, like many groups, defy
stereotyping.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia says Republicans and Democrats should avoid thinking of
Hispanics as a monolith and remember that they have a number of
political cross-currents.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing to understand, he says, is that the label Latino
or Hispanic covers people who come from two dozen countries and who
can claim mixtures of Spanish, Portuguese, Indian, African,
Italian, German and Italian ancestry.
</P>
<P>
   ``People need to remember that the word Latino or Hispanic
includes a large variety of people from many different countries
who have very different histories in this country,'' Garcia said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, according to a 1992 political survey of Hispanics by
Temple University's Institute for Survey Research, most didn't even
like being called Hispanic, preferring instead to be identified in
national-origin terms such as Mexican American or Puerto Rican.
</P>
<P>
   Only about one in five of those surveyed preferred to be
identified as Latino or Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   ``This desire by the press and politicians, and even us in
academia, to lump Latinos into one group really doesn't reflect the
views of a majority of the people out there,'' said Louis DeSipio,
an expert on Hispanic politics at the University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign.
</P>
<P>
   An important obstacle to creating a coalition of Hispanics is
geography. The community's three largest ethnic groups _ Mexicans,
Cubans and Puerto Ricans _ tend to live in different parts of the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican Americans, who make up almost two thirds of Hispanics in
the United States, are concentrated in the Southwest. Cuban
Americans live primarily in South Florida. Puerto Ricans have
settled mostly in the Northeast, particularly New York City and New
Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that each of these ethnic groups dominates
Hispanic politics in its particular region. Although this has
helped Hispanics to become political players, it also has hindered
the development of a national Hispanic political movement.
</P>
<P>
   DeSipio notes that ``industrial issues important to Puerto
Ricans in New York City don't have much to do with the rural or
suburban issues of Mexican Americans in California.''
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, analysts say, communities of identical ethnic
background can differ politically depending on where they live.
</P>
<P>
   Rodolfo de la Garza, a political science professor at the
University of Texas at Austin, insists that Mexican Americans
living in Texas tend to hold more conservative views on social
issues than Mexican Americans living in California. ``The
environment makes a difference,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Selena Walsh, director of policy and communications for the
League of United Latin American Citizens, a Hispanic advocacy
group, adds that Mexican Americans in Texas tend to be tougher on
crime and more supportive of anti-abortion measures than Mexican
Americans in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas is just a more conservative state and that comes across
in many communities, including the Hispanic community,'' Walsh
says.
</P>
<P>
   Like other groups, Hispanics have widely varying income and
educational levels, and that creates another obstacle to political
unity.
</P>
<P>
   ``In essence, Latino political leaders have the difficult task
of keeping together a wealthy Mexican American whose family has
lived in United States since before it was the United States and a
poor Salvadoran immigrant who arrived in the country last week,''
DeSipio explains.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign policy also continues to divide Hispanics. A majority of
Cuban Americans insist that the U.S. government should continue its
economic embargo of Cuba and other efforts to drive Fidel Castro
from power.
</P>
<P>
   However, DeSipio says, ``Mexican Americans care about
U.S.-Mexican relations but could care less about Cuban relations,
with the same being more or less true for the Puerto Ricans,
Salvadorans, etc.''
</P>
<P>
   While Hispanics often are politically fractured when it comes to
candidates and parties, they often come together on certain issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Education, civil rights, immigration and English-only drives
are areas that have the ability to override income, geography and
ethnic differences,'' says Lisa Navarrete, deputy vice president of
the National Council of La Raza, a Washington-based Hispanic
advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   Navarrete says if candidates _ regardless of their parties _
fall on the wrong side of these issues, Hispanic voters will turn
away from them at the polls.
</P>
<P>
   She says Republicans have been hurt among Hispanic voters by
recent Congressional legislation that curbed benefits for legal
immigrants and by a GOP-led 1994 initiative in California,
Proposition 187, that would have made undocumented immigrants
ineligible for public schooling and most other government services.
</P>
<P>
   Although Prop. 187 was passed by the voters of California, a
federal judge blocked its implementation, saying almost all of it
was unconstitutional. Gov. Pete Wilson has appealed the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Immigration is one thing that every Latino can relate to in
one way or another, and politicians need to remember this,''
Navarrete says.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh adds that while Hispanics often disagree on how many
immigrants should be allowed in the country, they have always
pulled together and fought for better treatment of immigrants
already on American soil.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is that we're all here as immigrants,'' she says.
``People either remember what it was like when they started
themselves or can imagine what it was like for their parents or
grandparents.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Navarrete adds that the GOP has also lost favor with many
Hispanic voters over the issue of education. ``Most Latinos are
poor or working class, and they see public education as the only
hope for their kids. They see Republicans as trying to take money
away from their schools.''
</P>
<P>
   But she says the Republican Party shouldn't write off Hispanics
because the vast majority of them fall in the middle of the
political spectrum, where they tend to vote for candidates on the
basis of their stands on issues, not their party.
</P>
<P>
   She notes that the goal _ perhaps elusive _ of many activists is
to bring Hispanic voters together as a single political bloc that
can use its power to push issues important to Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more we act as a solid group, the more politicians will
pay attention to our needs,'' Navarrete says.

DAILY RACING FORM PREPARING `RELAUNCH' 
</HEADLINE>
 FORM-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Daily Racing Form, recently purchased for $40 million by the
Alpine Racing Group, Tuesday announced a ``relaunch,'' to begin
with Saturday's edition, which will be available Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The publication will introduce a series of changes on two
fronts, editorial and statistical,'' said publisher Steve Crist.
``There will be a new look to the newspaper. We have redesigned
Page 1, with a news summary index column which reflects that there
is a lot more in the newspaper than there used to be. There will
also be a new Page 2, which will be a national leaderboard. It will
be a completely statistical page, with rankings in every category
you can imagine. It will look more like the Wall Street Journal
than a page in an average newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``As for past performances, we have a lot of long-range plans
for enhancements. The biggest one is that for major race meetings,
there will be 12 lines instead of 10. We will also indicate
blinkers on or off, first-time Lasix, and trainer changes. There
will be a lot more changes coming. We will list yearling purchase
prices for 2-year-olds and 3-year-olds, which we should have ready
to go by the end of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Crist addressed the problem of distribution, which has long
plagued the Form.
</P>
<P>
   ``Distribution as it currently exists is terrible,'' said Crist,
a former New York Times racing columnist, editor of The Racing
Times, and vice president of the New York Racing Association.
``That is the No. 1 complaint, and to fix it is Job One around
here. ... We're going to work to get our product out there. We hope
in six months it won't be a problem.''

`FLOWERS OF SHANGHAI': DISCREETLY VEILED BROTHELS OF OLD SHANGHAI 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review.) 
(gm) 
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Taiwanese film ``Flowers of Shanghai'' arrived late for its
critics' screening at the New York Film Festival. It wasn't
particularly worth the wait.
</P>
<P>
   Set in 1884 in the brothels of the English concession in
Shanghai, the director Hou Hsiao-hsien's tale of peevish
prostitutes and their gentleman callers is a sumptuous-looking film
that may please the eyes of connoisseurs of chinoiserie but is
unlikely to satisfy audiences in search of nuanced characters,
emotional engagement, dramatic momentum or reverberant history.
</P>
<P>
   Structured like a soap opera with a thin overlay of sociology,
the film switches among its accounts of the lives of lovely young
women in the so-called flower houses of the city _ women with names
like Crimson, Jade, Jasmin and Emerald.
</P>
<P>
   Sold to the brothels at the age of 7 or 8, they have been raised
for their careers, and since the film is discreet about the sexual
component of their lives, they are seen mostly attending moneyed
Chinese men as they feast, gamble and drink.
</P>
<P>
   But some of these women hope to buy themselves out of the
brothels or to marry their clients, perhaps even to attain the
lofty status of first wife in a society where more than one is
clearly not frowned upon.
</P>
<P>
   As for their clients, like the handsome young Wang (Tony Leung
Chiu-wai), relationships are not always without difficulty. The
longtime patron of Crimson (Michiko Hada), he has thrown her
emotional and economic life into chaos by taking up with Jasmin
(Wei Hsiao-hui). Meanwhile the astute Emerald (Michele Monique
Reis) is negotiating to buy her freedom, and Jade (Fang Hsuan) is
refusing other clients because she believes young Zhu Shuren (Simon
Chang) will marry her.
</P>
<P>
   So women weep and backbite, men trash rooms and deal with
questions of honor, poisonous potions of raw opium are prepared,
servants scold and gossip, and elders plot and scheme.
</P>
<P>
   ``Flowers of Shanghai,'' based on ``Hai Shang Hua,'' an 1894
novel by Han Ziyun, and adapted for the screen by Chu Tien-wen, is
obscure about the relationships among its male characters and
reveals little about their activities outside the brothels. Lavish
in its depiction of surfaces _ clothing, furniture, lighting
fixtures _ ``Flowers of Shanghai'' proves deficient in its
revelation of inner lives.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCTIONS NOTES:

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: RAISED BY SMOTHERERS AND NE'ER-DO-WELLS 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 By PETER MARKS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ They may not be wonderful role models, but they are
wonderful roles. Consider how many great American plays revolve
around spirit-crushing mothers and fathers: Amanda Wingfield, the
smothering succubus of ``The Glass Menagerie''; Willy Loman, the
wholesale disappointment of ``Death of a Salesman''; Mary and James
Tyrone, the blighted egoists of ``Long Day's Journey Into Night.''
</P>
<P>
   Even George and Martha, the childless vipers of ``Who's Afraid
of Virginia Woolf?'' fit the bill, if only metaphorically, killing
off the baby they never had.
</P>
<P>
   The track record is mighty impressive: bad parents make good
theater. Even when they are not cloaked in malicious black and
wearing handlebar mustaches, bad parents are dramatically
satisfying conveyances, the tormentors of that figure of universal
sympathy, the innocent child.
</P>
<P>
   Contemporary theater has no shortage of such victims; some of
the best-received dramas in New York of late, works like ``How I
Learned to Drive,'' ``Side Man'' and ``The Beauty Queen of
Leenane,'' carry on the tradition, unleashing toxic parents or
their surrogates on children who variously end up chastened,
bitterly wounded or homicidally inclined.
</P>
<P>
   Quantity is one indicator of just how popular the theme remains
with younger writers. The last two weeks, for instance, have seen
the openings of four Off Broadway plays that in various ways peer
into the cracks in relations between parents and children.
Unfortunately this quartet, though stylistically diverse _ from
earnest drama (`` 'Til the Rapture Comes'' and ``Hesh'') to
surrealistic satire (``Vegetable Love'') and situation comedy
(``Over the River and Through the Woods'') _ reveals the pitfalls
for playwrights stepping onto such familiar terrain. None of the
plays says anything compellingly new about a subject that should
provoke and incite. After all, the topic is not only reliable grist
for the stage but also one we compulsively dissect every day of our
lives.
</P>
<P>
   True to the tradition, however, the best parts continue to go to
the bad guys. Pamela Payton-Wright, as the manic, pill-popping
mother of Edward Napier's ``'Til the Rapture Comes'' at the WPA
Theater, and Ned Eisenberg, portraying a big-mouth, ne'er-do-well
father in Matthew Weiss' ``Hesh'' at the Intar, exude the negative
charisma the roles call for. Their take-charge performances as the
squeaky wheels in their houses are subversively effective.
Manipulating spouses and children pleading for forgiveness as they
stumble toward the next outrage, they provide fleetingly
entertaining moments. Their motives and failings are transparent in
ways that allow us to gloat from a safe distance.
</P>
<P>
   Napier's play, set in West Virginia in 1974, is a homage of
sorts to the great domestic tragedies of the past; the situation,
presumptuously, is a carbon of ``Long Day's Journey.'' Here as in
O'Neill are an addicted mother, a broken-spirited father (Richard
Poe), a pair of damaged sons (Jase Blankfort and Zach Shaffer) and
a family housekeeper (Cynthia Darlow).
</P>
<P>
   The drama, directed with a sense of time and place but with
little emotional consistency by Pamela Berlin (``Steel
Magnolias''), follows the struggle of Althea (Ms. Payton-Wright) to
right herself after a siege of Seconal abuse that has left her a
ravaged shell of a wife and mother. The effect on her children has
been traumatic: Ian, the younger son, played by Blankfort,
substitutes love and hope with a knee-jerk religious fanaticism,
while Willy (Shaffer) is on his way to an adolescence of drinking
and drugging.
</P>
<P>
   If the ingredients are obvious, so is the fallout. Accusations
are traded; a bit of domestic violence is committed; a father walks
out disconsolately. The problems are recognizable and even made to
seem understandable. But this is an opaque portrait of an American
household that is never really allowed to get under the family's
skin, or ours.
</P>
<P>
   More troublesome still is ``Hesh.'' Presented by Naked Angels,
an Off Broadway company that nurtured early versions of such
marvelously nuanced plays as ``This Is Our Youth,'' this new,
self-important family drama by Weiss is notable only for
Eisenberg's comic turn as the title character. In a weird example
of art imitating life, Weiss and his brother, Marcus, portray the
two sons in ``Hesh,'' which the playwright has said is modeled on
the brothers' relationship with their father. Oddly enough, they
are not particularly convincing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hesh'' is self-indulgent and condescending. Unintentionally,
it seems, it's a revenge play. Weiss practices here the theater of
blame, the sort that suggests, ridiculously, that all of one's
disappointments can be traced to a careless father. Hesh is a
Lomanesque loser, a failure at such basic duties as earning a
living or providing moral support. What's missing is any sense of
why attention must be paid.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of intriguing introductory scenes lay out the
distressing patterns of Hesh's life, but the play, directed by
Frank Pugliese, is chiefly concerned with the whining Sammy's
childish irritation with the older man. The playwright charts
Sammy's descent into drug abuse and listlessness, culminating in a
numbing, amphetamine-fueled tirade to his dying father on a beach
in Rockaway. The speech leaves the audience pretty much where it
walked in.
</P>
<P>
   Although ``'Til the Rapture Comes'' and ``Hesh'' provide the
showier parental roles, the divergent family comedies that opened
recently are richer experiences. In the absurdist ``Vegetable
Love'' at the 29th Street Rep, maternal love is such a volatile
force that, like an overfertilized garden, its power is
suffocating.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Farrell's imaginative production of Tammy Ryan's convoluted
play, featuring an incisive performance by Paula Ewin as a
tough-talking daughter of the Borough of Queens, begins in Archie
Bunker territory and ends somewhere beyond the world of Rod
Serling. Tomatoes grow with wild abundance in the basement of a
Queens home, nourished by the ashes of a recently deceased
patriarch, while babies gestate in the wombs of three grown sisters
and their late middle-aged mother, without visible means of
impregnation. Unfortunately, the play fails to develop a meaningful
narrative. It might be an interesting conceit for a one-act comedy,
but it is unworkable in two elongated acts.
</P>
<P>
   Joe DiPietro, on the other hand, has no interest in confusing,
surprising or provoking anyone. His ``Over the River and Through
the Woods,'' the story of a 30-ish, unmarried Italian-American man
and his four adorable grandparents, is unadulterated corn. A lot of
Italian food is prepared by Grandma Aida (Joan Copeland), but the
dramatic fare is as spiceless as ketchup. The unseen parents of the
play's hero, Nick Cristano (Jim Bracchitta) are retired and living
in Florida, so whether they were good or bad child-raisers seems a
moot point. Still, with fantasy grandparents like Aida and Frank
(Val Avery) and Emma and Nunzio (Marie Lillo and Dick Latessa) how
could they have been anything but perfect, too?
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the River,'' which could have transferred to the stage
directly from Channel 2 or 4, is every bit as manipulative as
``Hesh.'' There were a lot of sobs and sniffles in the audience of
the John Houseman Theater at a recent matinee, as Nick, struggling
for independence from the overbearing grandfolks, made the hard
choice to move to Seattle and leave them behind. Thanks to terrific
work by the entire cast, especially Avery and Latessa, these
sentimental characters actually carry some weight. Too bad the
nastiest act they can muster is cooking up a mean slice of veal.

`CELEBRATION': A FAMILY MAKING ORPHANHOOD LOOK GOOD 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Though it dedicates itself to avoiding directorial egotism, in
accordance with strict rules of the Danish filmmakers' collective
known as Dogma 95, Thomas Vinterberg's ``Celebration'' is still a
virtuoso feat.
</P>
<P>
   Five years out of film school and colossally assured, Vinterberg
strips away the conventions of ordinary filmmaking (as per the
group's manifesto) and furiously devises new, unfettered ways of
telling a story. If the style of this group, which also includes
the formidable trend-setter Lars von Trier, should ever become
widely imitated, it risks looking as fresh as the Macarena. But at
a time when filmmaking so often falls back on the familiar, its
effect indeed manages to be excitingly inventive and pure.
</P>
<P>
   Dogma 95, in brief: Look, Ma, no genre stories or superficial
action. No special lighting or extra sound. No tarting up the
location with props; no optical tricks; no camera work that isn't
hand-held. No black-and-white or flashbacks. And for the director,
goodbye to an actual credit and so-called personal imprint. ``My
supreme goal is to force the truth out of my characters and
settings,'' say the group's Vows of Chastity. ``I swear to do so by
all the means available and at the cost of any good taste and any
esthetic considerations.''
</P>
<P>
   If this sounds like a stunt, it surely doesn't look that way in
``The Celebration.'' Choosing as his setting a grand chateau that
is a family-owned hotel, Vinterberg presents a birthday reunion
that becomes a black-tie psyche-bashing blowout with latter-day
Shakespearean overtones.
</P>
<P>
   The king of this event is Helge (Henning Moritzen), a prosperous
patriarch turning 60 and presiding over longtime friends and
rebellious children. The event begins with an excess of gentility
(``Thanks for a lovely funeral,'' ``Thank YOU!'') and whirls into
battle royal once an army of skeletons comes out of this family's
closet. While the strictures on the film's direction may sound like
the visual equivalent of a brown rice diet, Vinterberg instead
shows off thrilling vitality.
</P>
<P>
   Taking full advantage of the lack of restrictions on film
editing, he hurtles the film forward in a manner that feels
seamless but calls for immense skill. With terrific agility, he
keeps the camera work vigorously mobile (the film was shot with a
small video camera, then transferred to Dogma-ordained
35-millimeter format) and jump cuts with nimble grace. And all the
ostensible limitations of this approach are transformed into
opportunities. Unusual vantage points, close scrutiny of faces and
savvy editing juxtapositions create the story's palpable momentum.
The confused hush at dinner after one shocking pronouncement
creates much sharper emphasis than any garden-variety music cue
would.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is quite a job being toastmaster tonight,'' remarks one
guest, illustrating the power of understatement as a tactic here,
too. Helge's son Christian (Ulrich Thomsen) arrives at the party
with the self-appointed mission of making his father own up to past
sins. As the full house of guests settle in _ including Michael
(Thomas Bo Larsen), Christian's black-sheep brother, and their
loose-cannon sister, Helene (Paprika Steen) _ Christian prepares to
tap his knife against his glass and make a terrible pronouncement.
He plans to tell the assembled revelers about having been
incestuously abused by Helge and that the death of Christian's twin
sister, Linda, is on Helge's hands. But like the audience,
Christian is in for some surprises. This crowd looks civilized, but
it proves amazingly shockproof, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Celebration,'' which easily accommodates allusions to both
``Cries and Whispers'' and ``The Godfather,'' features a large,
credible cast all over the hotel, from patrician guests to
flirtatious waitresses to Helene's American boyfriend (a black man
whose presence brings out the considerable worst in this family) to
a kitchen staff bent on settling old scores. They and Vinterberg
(who wrote the screenplay with Mogens Rukov) succeed dizzyingly
well in making this a party to remember.

`THE INHERITORS': SOWING A NEW ORDER IN ROCKY SOIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review.)  
(gm)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Were you always a peasant?'' one handsome young man asks
another in the Austrian film ``The Inheritors,'' prompting the
suspicion that a strain of tongue-in-cheek mischief may be alive
and well here. In the midst of Stefan Ruzowitzky's somber rural
allegory, which owes much of its visual inspiration to the palette
and compositional sense of the Dutch masters, that would indeed be
a ray of light. Ruzowitzky's film, part of the New York Film
Festival, does show off a knowingness that reaches beyond its
stylized simplicity, but its tone often remains uncertain. What
starts out as an arrestingly sharp film with strong political
undercurrents winds up increasingly unfocused as it goes along.
</P>
<P>
   Set in a Austrian village in the 1930s, but often looking so
classically rustic that it could date back a century or two
earlier, ``The Inheritors'' revolves around the death of a
landowner and his unexpected bequest.
</P>
<P>
   He leaves his farm to be divided up among seven workers who have
humbly labored there, and there are predictably fractious
consequences. Meanwhile, as the peasants try to create a new order
(a process as much expressed through wordless slurping of soup as
through resonant dialogue), a mystery hovers. A silent old woman
named Rosalind (Elizabeth Orth) has appeared in the dead man's
chicken coop. Naturally, there is much curiosity over what that
signifies.
</P>
<P>
   Less than it should, ultimately. ``The Inheritors'' works better
at defining its specific characters than at making them part of an
interesting scheme. Among those who stand out are Sophie Rois as
Emmy, the group's firebrand, and Simon Schwarz as Lukas, the former
foundling who becomes an object of fascination all around the
barnyard. ``Now everything is so complicated!'' Lukas complains
midway through the story, when the landowner's legacy has begun to
bear bitter fruit. Not complicated enough.

an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;a(at)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do hurricanes draw water from the sea as they increase in
strength? If so, why isn't the rain that results from a hurricane
part or all salt water?
</P>
<P>
   A: Hurricanes indeed do draw in droplets whipped off the ocean
surface, said Jack Beven of the National Hurricane Center in Miami,
so it's likely that rain produced by a hurricane does have some
salinity. Hurricanes also draw in water that has evaporated off the
ocean into the atmosphere. What isn't known, Beven said, is how
much salinity there might be in the resulting rain from a hurricane
because, to his knowledge, it has never been measured. He also said
that once a hurricane leaves the ocean and moves over land, the
amount of salinity in the rain probably would decrease.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I saw Russian immigrants buying smoked salmon with food
stamps. Is that legal? Aren't food stamps intended for staples?
</P>
<P>
   A: Households meeting eligibility requirements _ U.S. citizens
and some aliens admitted to the United States for permanent
residence _ can use food stamps to buy any food or food product for
human consumption. Salmon, smoked or otherwise, would fall into
that category. They also can buy seeds and plants for use in home
gardens to produce food. Households cannot use food stamps to buy
alcoholic beverages and tobacco; lunch counter items or foods to be
eaten in the store; vitamins or medicines; pet foods; and any
nonfood items (except seeds and plants), such as toiletries.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I would like a yes or no answer. Was Kenneth Starr named
special prosecutor by three judges on a higher court who were
nominated by conservative or Republican presidents?
</P>
<P>
   A: The answer is two-thirds yes, one-third no. The members of
the three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington
who appointed Starr were David Sentelle, a judge of the U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington; John Butzner, senior judge
for the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond; and Joseph
Sneed, senior judge on the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San
Francisco. Sentelle was appointed by Ronald Reagan; Butzner by
Lyndon Johnson; Sneed by Richard Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How has John Glenn been performing his elected duties as a
U.S. senator from Ohio, such as voting, attending committee
meetings and so on, since he has been in training for his October
NASA launch?
</P>
<P>
   A: Earlier this year, Glenn was able to take part in Senate
sessions and then went to Houston's Johnson Space Flight Center for
training during recesses, said spokesman Jack Sparks in Washington.
More recently, however, Glenn has given his NASA training priority
over his Senate duties, and therefore has had to miss some of the
Senate sessions. Glenn now is in training full time for the
scheduled launch Oct. 29, Sparks added.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What has become of skier Picabo Street? I know she was
injured.
</P>
<P>
   A: A month after Street won the Olympic super-G title in Nagano,
Japan, she tore the anterior cruciate ligament in her right knee
and broke her left leg when she crashed during the downhill in the
World Cup finals at Crans Montana, Switzerland. Although she has
said publicly that she won't be racing for another year, Street
hopes to be back on skis in November. ``I'm coming out of a hole,''
she said last month before speaking during the U.S. Ski and
Snowboard Association congress in Park City, Utah. ``I'll ski for
the winter, then decide what's next.'' She is continuing therapy,
which includes a combination of training in a pool and on a bike
and treadmill. Earlier in the summer Street was asked by a Mountain
Zone magazine interviewer about her timetable for competitive
skiing. Street said, ``2001 and 2002 are probably the seasons that
I'll go back to skiing and compete in Salt Lake (2002 Olympics) and
retire after that.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Has Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas ever voiced an
opinion about the Clinton sex scandal?
</P>
<P>
   A: He isn't known to have made any direct public comments about
President Clinton and his relationship with Monica Lewinsky. At a
question-and-answer session Sept. 14 after a speech before the
National Restaurant Association convention in Arlington, Va., the
justice was asked pointedly about Clinton's problems. As reported
by The Associated Press, he declined to respond directly, only
saying, ``The president of the United States is the president of
the United States.'' He then urged his audience to devote
themselves to being good citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Observers thought Thomas came closer to expressing an opinion in
late September when he spoke to a group of Catholic judges and
lawyers at the 31st annual Red Mass, a blessing of the legal
profession, at St. Vincent College in Latrobe, Pa. While he didn't
mention Clinton or Lewinsky by name, Thomas said, ``Does character
matter? The answer is, emphatically, yes. Character always matters.
But it is your character that matters, not your neighbor's.'' He
continued by saying the best way to teach virtue is to lead by
example and not by pointing fingers. He said it's easy to criticize
moral failures of others, yet tough for people to demand and
maintain their own ethical character and high moral standards.
``Somehow we find it more comfortable and safer to attack someone
else's problems than our own.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: I recently saw an article mentioning that the late Colonel
Sanders of fried chicken fame ``got one of those honorary Kentucky
colonel certificates.''What is a Kentucky colonel?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's an honorary title bestowed by the commonwealth of
Kentucky. The tradition began in 1813, during the second term of
Gov. Isaac Shelby, when he bestowed the title of colonel on Charles
Todd, his son-in-law and a member of his staff. Shelby later issued
commissions to all who enlisted in his regiment in the War of 1812.
Later governors commissioned colonels to act as their protective
guard, and the practice was continued until 1932, when then-Gov.
Ruby Laffoon added ``Honorable Order'' to the name to reflect the
honorary status of its members. The Honorable Order of Kentucky
Colonels was incorporated as a charitable organization and bylaws
were written to designate the organization as ``nonpartisan,
nonprofit and dedicated to good works within the commonwealth of
Kentucky.'' People as varied as Winston Churchill, Bing Crosby,
Lyndon Johnson and Red Skelton have been given the title.
</P>
<P>
   Q: As I prepare to e-mail this question to Q&AMP;A, the Dow Jones
Industrial Average is down 91 points. In reviewing the stocks that
comprise the 30 industrials, I don't see this amount. How is the
change in the average calculated?
</P>
<P>
   A: Stock splits must be taken into account, said Myron Greene,
publisher of Mutual Fund Timing Guide. When Dow Jones and Co. first
began computing the Dow Jones Industrial Average in 1896, it was a
simple average of the prices of 12 of the leading stocks of the
day. Such an average is easy to calculate, but a problem arises
when one of the component companies splits its stock.
</P>
<P>
   Consider a simple index consisting of only two stocks, both
priced at $30 a share. Obviously, the average price is $30. Now
suppose that one of the stocks is split two for one. Each
shareholder ends up with two shares for each one previously held,
but each share is worth only $15, so nothing has really changed for
the shareholder. The split will affect the index, however, because
the new value is the average of $30 and $15, or $22.50. If no
adjustment is made, it will appear that the average has dropped
sharply when, in fact, nothing has changed.
</P>
<P>
   Greene explained that the method used by Dow Jones to adjust for
stock splits is to change the divisor used in calculating the
average. In this example, the sum of $30 plus $15 is divided by 1.5
rather than 2, giving the same result as before (or $30). The
divisor also is adjusted when the number of stocks in the average

   Q: It was reported recently that Edith Stein will be canonized
soon by Pope John Paul II. What did she do?
</P>
<P>
   A: A miracle involving a child is an important element, along
with writings revealing her willingness to embrace death and her
``mystical'' identification with Jesus Christ. In April 1997, the
Vatican authenticated a miracle attributed to Stein's intercession
in the case of a 2-year-old girl who had swallowed poison. The
child was the daughter of the Rev. Emmanuel McCarthy of Brockton,
Mass., a Melkite Rite priest who had long revered Stein as a symbol
of ``nonviolent love'' (the Melkite Rite permits married men to be
ordained). When the child was born in 1984, she was given Stein's
Carmelite name, Benedicta, in order to place her under Edith's
protection. Benedicta was born Aug. 8, which would have been Aug. 9
in Europe, the anniversary of Stein's death in 1942 at Auschwitz,
the infamous Nazi death camp in Poland. Three days after the
McCarthys prayed for Stein's intercession in the poisoning,
Benedicta began to recover. Vatican medical committees determined
that her healing had no scientific explanation, and ruled that it
was an authentic miracle attributable to Stein's intercession.
</P>
<P>
   The Jewish-born Stein converted to Catholicism in 1922 and
entered a Carmelite convent in Cologne, Germany, the next year. She
was beatified in 1987 in Cologne by Pope Paul II. She is scheduled
to be canonized Oct. 11.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who are the actors who portray Bill Clinton and Monica
Lewinsky on NBC's ``Tonight Show With Jay Leno''?
</P>
<P>
   A: Tim Watters is the Bill Clinton character and Kellye Rowland
plays Lewinsky. A third performer is Teresa Barnwell as Hillary
Rodham Clinton. They're all regulars appearing in continuing skits
about the White House, said ``Tonight'' spokeswoman Jennifer
Barnett.

   MCCARTY-COLUMN _ DAYTON, Ohio _ I scratched my head, wondering
how my most significant achievements would translate into granite:
``She kept an epically messy desk.'' ``She got her son to school on
time one morning in 1997.'' Ah, to be among that roster of
Daytonians, who, though obscure in name, achieved things that are
world-renowned and easy to summarize. (McCarty, Dayton Daily News)

   KELSO-COLUMN _ AUSTIN, Texas _ I'm so smart I need an extra

like they used to? (Kelso, Austin American-Statesman) MOVED.

   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail

<P>
   UNDATED: Q: Who are the actors who portray Bill Clinton and
Monica Lewinsky on NBC's ``Tonight Show With Jay Leno''?
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did the government ever issue a final report on the cause of
the crash of Commerce Secretary Ron Brown's plane? Was a ``black
box'' aboard?
</P>
<P>
   A: The crash in Croatia of the CT-43A, a military version of the
Boeing 737, was caused by a ``failure of command, air crew error,
and an improperly designed instrument approach,'' according to a
report headed by Air Force Maj. Gen. Charles Coolidge Jr. In
effect, the report blamed the 86th Airlift Wing commanders, the
pilots of the plane carrying Brown and 34 other people, and the
Croatian civilians who designed the airport's instrument landing
procedures.
</P>
<P>
   The plane, on its way from Tuzla in Bosnia to fog-shrouded
Dubrovnik, slammed into a mountainside April 3, 1996. A critical
pilot error, Coolidge said, came beforehand when the crew failed to
realize that an instrument landing at Dubrovnik would require a
two-channel receiver to gain directional headings from two
ground-based beacons that used 1930s technology. The CT-43A was
equipped with a one-channel receiver. The plane hit the mountain at
160 mph without wavering from its incorrect course.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force acknowledged that the 23-year-old plane was not
equipped with a so-called black box flight data recorder. In July
1996, the Air Force disciplined about 15 personnel, including at
least two generals, in connection with the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent article reported that aspirin may ward off colon
cancer, and researchers are going to test the pills on hundreds of
at-risk people. My mother, father and grandmother all died of colon
cancer, so I would like to be involved . Where can I get
information?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Aspirin Study likely will be approved by the National
Cancer Institute in early 1999. For information about it, call Deb
Rose of the Familial Colorectal Cancer Registry, 215-955-0026.
Participants for the study will be selected from the registry.
Additionally, as published recently in Annals of Internal Medicine,
there's also an apparent reduction of risk of colon cancer among
people who drink orange juice and eat lots of vegetables rich in
the B-vitamin folate, such as spinach, broccoli and romaine
lettuce. Folic acid is the form of folate present in multivitamin
supplements.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In the not-too-distant past, England had a big sex scandal
involving a member of Parliament named Profumo. The scandal went on
for months. Whatever happened to him, and to the woman involved?
</P>
<P>
   A: The 1963 case of John Profumo, British war minister at the
time, is believed to have been the first to bring details of a
leading politician's sexcapades to newspaper pages. Profumo, then
48, was a rising star in the Conservative government of Prime
Minister Harold McMillan when the ``Profumo affair,'' as it came to
be called, began to unfold. It seems his mistress, Christine
Keeler, then 21, also was carrying on with Yevgeny Ivanov, a Soviet
diplomat and KGB agent in London.
</P>
<P>
   Profumo was forced to resign from government after admitting
that he lied to Parliament when he denied the affair. McMillan also
resigned, and the Conservative Party, which had been in power for
13 years, lost the election shortly afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Profumo, now 83, keeps a low profile and doesn't grant
interviews, although in 1975 he appeared in public with his wife,
former actress Valerie Hobson, to receive a medal in recognition of
his social work. After ``the affair,'' Keeler became a celebrity of
sorts, making top-dollar cabaret appearances before serving time in
prison for perjury. Now 56, she has struggled with drug addiction
and has been divorced twice. Ivanov died in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Q: CNN recently featured someone named John Whitehead as an
expert opinion-giver on the Clinton impeachment proceedings. He
worked for something called the Rutherford Institute in Washington.
I also recall seeing that a John Whitehead was an attorney for
Paula Jones. Are they one and the same?
</P>
<P>
   A: They are one and the same. The Rutherford Institute, a
nonprofit group based in Charlottesville, Va., took up the Paula
Jones case and found lawyers in its membership network to represent
her. In the past, the Rutherford Institute most often has taken up
the defense of religious rights. Its founder, John Whitehead, was
raised in Clinton's home state of Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can the average citizen find out just how much in
campaign donations a particular candidate received from a specific
insurance carrier, which could possibly influence the candidate's
legislative direction?
</P>
<P>
   A: The easiest way to learn who contributed to any candidate for
the U.S. Senate or House is to look up the candidate's name on one
of these Web sites on the Internet: the Center for Responsive
Politics, (www.crp.org); FECInfo (www.tray.com/fecinfo); or the
Federal Election Commission (www.fec.gov).
</P>
<P>
   Q: I understand that an organization will block out
telemarketing calls to a person's home. Do you have any
information?
</P>
<P>
   A: One way to have your name removed from telemarketing lists is
to write: Telephone Preference Service, Direct Marketing
Association, P.O. Box 9014, Farmingdale, N.Y. 11735--9014.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've always wondered about Whoopi Goldberg. Is that her real
name?
</P>
<P>
   A: The actress-comedienne tries to keep her identity secret. The
reason, she once told a reporter, is to protect her family. ``I can
go home and live as this other person, and even though I look like
Whoopi Goldberg on the street, I can whip out my driver's license
and say, 'Hey, but I'm not.' ''
</P>
<P>
   It's known, however, that she was born Caryn Johnson in 1950 in
New York, where she and a younger brother lived with their mother,
Emma Johnson, in the Chelsea section of Manhattan. Goldberg claims
that she is ``half Jewish and half Catholic,'' and that one day she
received her invented name by divine revelation. Of the name, the
performer said, ``It was a joke. First it was Whoopi Cushion. Then
it was French, like Whoopi Cushon.'' Her mother told her no one
would respect her with a name like that, she said, so she decided
to use Goldberg instead. ``Goldberg's a part of my family somewhere
and that's all I can say about it,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why did we have an apparent foreign name, Georges, for a
hurricane?
</P>
<P>
   A: Some of the names have an international flavor because
hurricanes affect other nations and are tracked by countries other
than the United States. One of the major purposes of naming
hurricanes is to help in the exchange of detailed storm information
between hundreds of widely scattered stations, airports, coastal
bases and ships at sea. So, to make international communications
easier, we have Georges, Chantal, Pablo, Gustav, Ernesto, Tomas and
Virginie, among others. The names are selected from library sources
and agreed upon by nations involved during international meetings
of the World Meteorological Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is it true that Kenneth Starr, appearing on ``60 Minutes'' in
1987, said public media should not contain explicit or implied
descriptions of sex acts, and referred to people as perverts who
provide the media with pornographic material while pretending it
has redeeming social value.
</P>
<P>
   A: Kevin Tedesco, spokesman for ``60 Minutes'' at CBS in New
York, said he knew that tale was making the rounds on the Internet,
because CBS had been swamped with inquiries. But it's not true, he
said. The network checked its records and discovered that Starr has
never even been on ``60 Minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Track star Florence Griffith Joyner's obituary stated that
the cause of death was a heart seizure. What exactly is that?
</P>
<P>
   A: Heart seizure is a term used to describe an ``acute
irregularity'' of the heartbeat which can result in its not
functioning properly, said Carole Bullock of the American Heart
Association. It's not the same as a heart attack, she added. Two
years ago, Griffith Joyner suffered a seizure while on a flight
from California to St. Louis, said Bob Kersee, who coached Griffith
Joyner and was related to her by marriage. The report that her
death was believed to have been caused by another seizure came from
a family spokesman. But a day later, Kersee backed away from that,
saying, ``We have no idea why Florence left us.''

an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta

<P>
   Q: Do hurricanes draw water from the sea as they increase in
strength? If so, why isn't the rain that results from a hurricane
part or all salt water?
</P>
<P>
   A: Hurricanes indeed do draw in droplets whipped off the ocean
surface, said Jack Beven of the National Hurricane Center in Miami,
so it's likely that rain produced by a hurricane does have some
salinity. Hurricanes also draw in water that has evaporated off the
ocean into the atmosphere. What isn't known, Beven said, is how
much salinity there might be in the resulting rain from a hurricane
because, to his knowledge, it has never been measured. He also said
that once a hurricane leaves the ocean and moves over land, the
amount of salinity in the rain probably would decrease.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I saw Russian immigrants buying smoked salmon with food
stamps. Is that legal? Aren't food stamps intended for staples?
</P>
<P>
   A: Households meeting eligibility requirements _ U.S. citizens
and some aliens admitted to the United States for permanent
residence _ can use food stamps to buy any food or food product for
human consumption. Salmon, smoked or otherwise, would fall into
that category. They also can buy seeds and plants for use in home
gardens to produce food. Households cannot use food stamps to buy
alcoholic beverages and tobacco; lunch counter items or foods to be
eaten in the store; vitamins or medicines; pet foods; and any
nonfood items (except seeds and plants), such as toiletries.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I would like a yes or no answer. Was Kenneth Starr named
special prosecutor by three judges on a higher court who were
nominated by conservative or Republican presidents?
</P>
<P>
   A: The answer is two-thirds yes, one-third no. The members of
the three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington
who appointed Starr were David Sentelle, a judge of the U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington; John Butzner, senior judge
for the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond; and Joseph
Sneed, senior judge on the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San
Francisco. Sentelle was appointed by Ronald Reagan; Butzner by
Lyndon Johnson; Sneed by Richard Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How has John Glenn been performing his elected duties as a
U.S. senator from Ohio, such as voting, attending committee
meetings and so on, since he has been in training for his October
NASA launch?
</P>
<P>
   A: Earlier this year, Glenn was able to take part in Senate
sessions and then went to Houston's Johnson Space Flight Center for
training during recesses, said spokesman Jack Sparks in Washington.
More recently, however, Glenn has given his NASA training priority
over his Senate duties, and therefore has had to miss some of the
Senate sessions. Glenn now is in training full time for the
scheduled launch Oct. 29, Sparks added.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What has become of skier Picabo Street? I know she was
injured.
</P>
<P>
   A: A month after Street won the Olympic super-G title in Nagano,
Japan, she tore the anterior cruciate ligament in her right knee
and broke her left leg when she crashed during the downhill in the
World Cup finals at Crans Montana, Switzerland. Although she has
said publicly that she won't be racing for another year, Street
hopes to be back on skis in November. ``I'm coming out of a hole,''
she said last month before speaking during the U.S. Ski and
Snowboard Association congress in Park City, Utah. ``I'll ski for
the winter, then decide what's next.'' She is continuing therapy,
which includes a combination of training in a pool and on a bike
and treadmill. Earlier in the summer Street was asked by a Mountain
Zone magazine interviewer about her timetable for competitive
skiing. Street said, ``2001 and 2002 are probably the seasons that
I'll go back to skiing and compete in Salt Lake (2002 Olympics) and
retire after that.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Has Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas ever voiced an
opinion about the Clinton sex scandal?
</P>
<P>
   A: He isn't known to have made any direct public comments about
President Clinton and his relationship with Monica Lewinsky. At a
question-and-answer session Sept. 14 after a speech before the
National Restaurant Association convention in Arlington, Va., the
justice was asked pointedly about Clinton's problems. As reported
by The Associated Press, he declined to respond directly, only
saying, ``The president of the United States is the president of
the United States.'' He then urged his audience to devote
themselves to being good citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Observers thought Thomas came closer to expressing an opinion in
late September when he spoke to a group of Catholic judges and
lawyers at the 31st annual Red Mass, a blessing of the legal
profession, at St. Vincent College in Latrobe, Pa. While he didn't
mention Clinton or Lewinsky by name, Thomas said, ``Does character
matter? The answer is, emphatically, yes. Character always matters.
But it is your character that matters, not your neighbor's.'' He
continued by saying the best way to teach virtue is to lead by
example and not by pointing fingers. He said it's easy to criticize
moral failures of others, yet tough for people to demand and
maintain their own ethical character and high moral standards.
``Somehow we find it more comfortable and safer to attack someone
else's problems than our own.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: I recently saw an article mentioning that the late Colonel
Sanders of fried chicken fame ``got one of those honorary Kentucky
colonel certificates.''What is a Kentucky colonel?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's an honorary title bestowed by the commonwealth of
Kentucky. The tradition began in 1813, during the second term of
Gov. Isaac Shelby, when he bestowed the title of colonel on Charles
Todd, his son-in-law and a member of his staff. Shelby later issued
commissions to all who enlisted in his regiment in the War of 1812.
Later governors commissioned colonels to act as their protective
guard, and the practice was continued until 1932, when then-Gov.
Ruby Laffoon added ``Honorable Order'' to the name to reflect the
honorary status of its members. The Honorable Order of Kentucky
Colonels was incorporated as a charitable organization and bylaws
were written to designate the organization as ``nonpartisan,
nonprofit and dedicated to good works within the commonwealth of
Kentucky.'' People as varied as Winston Churchill, Bing Crosby,
Lyndon Johnson and Red Skelton have been given the title.
</P>
<P>
   Q: As I prepare to e-mail this question to Q&AMP;A, the Dow Jones
Industrial Average is down 91 points. In reviewing the stocks that
comprise the 30 industrials, I don't see this amount. How is the
change in the average calculated?
</P>
<P>
   A: Stock splits must be taken into account, said Myron Greene,
publisher of Mutual Fund Timing Guide. When Dow Jones and Co. first
began computing the Dow Jones Industrial Average in 1896, it was a
simple average of the prices of 12 of the leading stocks of the
day. Such an average is easy to calculate, but a problem arises
when one of the component companies splits its stock.
</P>
<P>
   Consider a simple index consisting of only two stocks, both
priced at $30 a share. Obviously, the average price is $30. Now
suppose that one of the stocks is split two for one. Each
shareholder ends up with two shares for each one previously held,
but each share is worth only $15, so nothing has really changed for
the shareholder. The split will affect the index, however, because
the new value is the average of $30 and $15, or $22.50. If no
adjustment is made, it will appear that the average has dropped
sharply when, in fact, nothing has changed.
</P>
<P>
   Greene explained that the method used by Dow Jones to adjust for
stock splits is to change the divisor used in calculating the
average. In this example, the sum of $30 plus $15 is divided by 1.5
rather than 2, giving the same result as before (or $30). The
divisor also is adjusted when the number of stocks in the average
changes, as was the case in1916 and 1928, and when a stock in the
average is replaced. To calculate the value of the Dow Jones
Industrial Average today, add up the prices of the 30 Dow stocks
and divide by the current divisor, which is roughly 1/4.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It was reported recently that Edith Stein will be canonized
soon by Pope John Paul II. What did she do?
</P>
<P>
   A: A miracle involving a child is an important element, along
with writings revealing her willingness to embrace death and her
``mystical'' identification with Jesus Christ. In April 1997, the
Vatican authenticated a miracle attributed to Stein's intercession
in the case of a 2-year-old girl who had swallowed poison. The
child was the daughter of the Rev. Emmanuel McCarthy of Brockton,
Mass., a Melkite Rite priest who had long revered Stein as a symbol
of ``nonviolent love'' (the Melkite Rite permits married men to be
ordained). When the child was born in 1984, she was given Stein's
Carmelite name, Benedicta, in order to place her under Edith's
protection. Benedicta was born Aug. 8, which would have been Aug. 9
in Europe, the anniversary of Stein's death in 1942 at Auschwitz,
the infamous Nazi death camp in Poland. Three days after the
McCarthys prayed for Stein's intercession in the poisoning,
Benedicta began to recover. Vatican medical committees determined
that her healing had no scientific explanation, and ruled that it
was an authentic miracle attributable to Stein's intercession.
</P>
<P>
   The Jewish-born Stein converted to Catholicism in 1922 and
entered a Carmelite convent in Cologne, Germany, the next year. She
was beatified in 1987 in Cologne by Pope Paul II. She is scheduled
to be canonized Oct. 11.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who are the actors who portray Bill Clinton and Monica
Lewinsky on NBC's ``Tonight Show With Jay Leno''?
</P>
<P>
   A: Tim Watters is the Bill Clinton character and Kellye Rowland
plays Lewinsky. A third performer is Teresa Barnwell as Hillary
Rodham Clinton. They're all regulars appearing in continuing skits
about the White House, said ``Tonight'' spokeswoman Jennifer
Barnett.

<P>
   UNDATED: Q: Who are the actors who portray Bill Clinton and
Monica Lewinsky on NBC's ``Tonight Show With Jay Leno''?
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did the government ever issue a final report on the cause of
the crash of Commerce Secretary Ron Brown's plane? Was a ``black
box'' aboard?
</P>
<P>
   A: The crash in Croatia of the CT-43A, a military version of the
Boeing 737, was caused by a ``failure of command, air crew error,
and an improperly designed instrument approach,'' according to a
report headed by Air Force Maj. Gen. Charles Coolidge Jr. In
effect, the report blamed the 86th Airlift Wing commanders, the
pilots of the plane carrying Brown and 34 other people, and the
Croatian civilians who designed the airport's instrument landing
procedures.
</P>
<P>
   The plane, on its way from Tuzla in Bosnia to fog-shrouded
Dubrovnik, slammed into a mountainside April 3, 1996. A critical
pilot error, Coolidge said, came beforehand when the crew failed to
realize that an instrument landing at Dubrovnik would require a
two-channel receiver to gain directional headings from two
ground-based beacons that used 1930s technology. The CT-43A was
equipped with a one-channel receiver. The plane hit the mountain at
160 mph without wavering from its incorrect course.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force acknowledged that the 23-year-old plane was not
equipped with a so-called black box flight data recorder. In July
1996, the Air Force disciplined about 15 personnel, including at
least two generals, in connection with the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent article reported that aspirin may ward off colon
cancer, and researchers are going to test the pills on hundreds of
at-risk people. My mother, father and grandmother all died of colon
cancer, so I would like to be involved . Where can I get
information?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Aspirin Study likely will be approved by the National
Cancer Institute in early 1999. For information about it, call Deb
Rose of the Familial Colorectal Cancer Registry, 215-955-0026.
Participants for the study will be selected from the registry.
Additionally, as published recently in Annals of Internal Medicine,
there's also an apparent reduction of risk of colon cancer among
people who drink orange juice and eat lots of vegetables rich in
the B-vitamin folate, such as spinach, broccoli and romaine
lettuce. Folic acid is the form of folate present in multivitamin
supplements.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In the not-too-distant past, England had a big sex scandal
involving a member of Parliament named Profumo. The scandal went on
for months. Whatever happened to him, and to the woman involved?
</P>
<P>
   A: The 1963 case of John Profumo, British war minister at the
time, is believed to have been the first to bring details of a
leading politician's sexcapades to newspaper pages. Profumo, then
48, was a rising star in the Conservative government of Prime
Minister Harold McMillan when the ``Profumo affair,'' as it came to
be called, began to unfold. It seems his mistress, Christine
Keeler, then 21, also was carrying on with Yevgeny Ivanov, a Soviet
diplomat and KGB agent in London.
</P>
<P>
   Profumo was forced to resign from government after admitting
that he lied to Parliament when he denied the affair. McMillan also
resigned, and the Conservative Party, which had been in power for
13 years, lost the election shortly afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Profumo, now 83, keeps a low profile and doesn't grant
interviews, although in 1975 he appeared in public with his wife,
former actress Valerie Hobson, to receive a medal in recognition of
his social work. After ``the affair,'' Keeler became a celebrity of
sorts, making top-dollar cabaret appearances before serving time in
prison for perjury. Now 56, she has struggled with drug addiction
and has been divorced twice. Ivanov died in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Q: CNN recently featured someone named John Whitehead as an
expert opinion-giver on the Clinton impeachment proceedings. He
worked for something called the Rutherford Institute in Washington.
I also recall seeing that a John Whitehead was an attorney for
Paula Jones. Are they one and the same?
</P>
<P>
   A: They are one and the same. The Rutherford Institute, a
nonprofit group based in Charlottesville, Va., took up the Paula
Jones case and found lawyers in its membership network to represent
her. In the past, the Rutherford Institute most often has taken up
the defense of religious rights. Its founder, John Whitehead, was
raised in Clinton's home state of Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can the average citizen find out just how much in
campaign donations a particular candidate received from a specific
insurance carrier, which could possibly influence the candidate's
legislative direction?
</P>
<P>
   A: The easiest way to learn who contributed to any candidate for
the U.S. Senate or House is to look up the candidate's name on one
of these Web sites on the Internet: the Center for Responsive
Politics, (www.crp.org); FECInfo (www.tray.com/fecinfo); or the
Federal Election Commission (www.fec.gov).
</P>
<P>
   Q: I understand that an organization will block out
telemarketing calls to a person's home. Do you have any
information?
</P>
<P>
   A: One way to have your name removed from telemarketing lists is
to write: Telephone Preference Service, Direct Marketing
Association, P.O. Box 9014, Farmingdale, N.Y. 11735--9014.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've always wondered about Whoopi Goldberg. Is that her real
name?
</P>
<P>
   A: The actress-comedienne tries to keep her identity secret. The
reason, she once told a reporter, is to protect her family. ``I can
go home and live as this other person, and even though I look like
Whoopi Goldberg on the street, I can whip out my driver's license
and say, 'Hey, but I'm not.' ''
</P>
<P>
   It's known, however, that she was born Caryn Johnson in 1950 in
New York, where she and a younger brother lived with their mother,
Emma Johnson, in the Chelsea section of Manhattan. Goldberg claims
that she is ``half Jewish and half Catholic,'' and that one day she
received her invented name by divine revelation. Of the name, the
performer said, ``It was a joke. First it was Whoopi Cushion. Then
it was French, like Whoopi Cushon.'' Her mother told her no one
would respect her with a name like that, she said, so she decided
to use Goldberg instead. ``Goldberg's a part of my family somewhere
and that's all I can say about it,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why did we have an apparent foreign name, Georges, for a
hurricane?
</P>
<P>
   A: Some of the names have an international flavor because
hurricanes affect other nations and are tracked by countries other
than the United States. One of the major purposes of naming
hurricanes is to help in the exchange of detailed storm information
between hundreds of widely scattered stations, airports, coastal
bases and ships at sea. So, to make international communications
easier, we have Georges, Chantal, Pablo, Gustav, Ernesto, Tomas and
Virginie, among others. The names are selected from library sources
and agreed upon by nations involved during international meetings
of the World Meteorological Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is it true that Kenneth Starr, appearing on ``60 Minutes'' in
1987, said public media should not contain explicit or implied
descriptions of sex acts, and referred to people as perverts who
provide the media with pornographic material while pretending it
has redeeming social value.
</P>
<P>
   A: Kevin Tedesco, spokesman for ``60 Minutes'' at CBS in New
York, said he knew that tale was making the rounds on the Internet,
because CBS had been swamped with inquiries. But it's not true, he
said. The network checked its records and discovered that Starr has
never even been on ``60 Minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Track star Florence Griffith Joyner's obituary stated that
the cause of death was a heart seizure. What exactly is that?
</P>
<P>
   A: Heart seizure is a term used to describe an ``acute
irregularity'' of the heartbeat which can result in its not
functioning properly, said Carole Bullock of the American Heart
Association. It's not the same as a heart attack, she added. Two
years ago, Griffith Joyner suffered a seizure while on a flight
from California to St. Louis, said Bob Kersee, who coached Griffith
Joyner and was related to her by marriage. The report that her
death was believed to have been caused by another seizure came from
a family spokesman. But a day later, Kersee backed away from that,
saying, ``We have no idea why Florence left us.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Isaac Mizrahi dropped a fashion bombshell on Oct. 1:
He said his 10-year-old business is closing.
</P>
<P>
   Mizrahi, a designer whose ebullient personality matched his
colorful clothing, said his partnership with Chanel was being
dissolved.
</P>
<P>
   Chanel, which has backed the business since 1992, is said to
have become increasingly impatient with its mounting losses.
</P>
<P>
   There will be no spring 1999 Isaac Mizrahi Collection, and the
Isaac Mizrahi &AMP; Co. headquarters on Wooster Street in SoHo soon
will go dark.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little shocking, but that's life,'' an
uncharacteristically rueful Mizrahi told WWD just hours after he
broke the news to about 55 employees. ``It's all for the best. It's
a good decision, as painful as it was to make. I'm taking a break
and observing what fate has to offer me now. I feel very excited
about the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Mizrahi said it was a ``joint decision'' with Chanel to shut
down his fashion business. He said initially he plans to
concentrate on a multitude of ``promising'' entertainment ventures,
including film production and screenwriting. He's working on a
movie optioned by Dreamworks based on his comic book, ``The
Adventures of Sandee the Supermodel.''
</P>
<P>
   He's also writing the third draft of a screenplay entitled
``Wild About Harry'' that has been optioned by Barry Sonnenfeld and
Disney; Mizrahi said he might star in it. He did not say
definitively if or when he would get back into the fashion
business.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was searching for new financial backers to relaunch
a fashion business, he said he was not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up to this point, my first commitment has been to fashion, but
now I don't know,'' he said, sitting at the desk where he has done
dozens of interviews and where he was filmed for the 1995 movie
``Unzipped'' that catapulted him to fashion fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will always have a great love of fashion,'' he said. ``I
will always be a fashion designer, but I don't know what form it's
going to take. I'm really at this crossroads, and I'm going to
allow fate to take over. I can't fight fate. It's been the driving
force of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Seemingly as bewildered by his shocking announcement as the
fashion world, Mizrahi declined to predict what his future will
hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a psychic. I don't know what I'm going to come back
as,'' he said. ``I don't envision myself six months from now or six
years from now. I just do. I solve creative problems. Right now,
what I want to do has to be culturally sound, whatever I do next.''
</P>
<P>
   News of the shutdown comes less than nine months after Mizrahi
closed his two-year-old Isaac bridge line, a venture initially
heralded as an enormous growth opportunity for the brand.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, about 65 workers were laid off at Mizrahi's SoHo
headquarters and its warehouse in Secaucus, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Chanel said on Oct. 1 that it is withdrawing its financial
backing because the Mizrahi's business volume was not large enough
to warrant Chanel's stake, which is believed to be approximately 70
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're dissolving the partnership,'' said Michael Rena,
executive vice president of Chanel Inc. ``The volume was not big
enough to make it interesting for us or him to continue. He doesn't
need us. He doesn't need backers to have the kind of
entrepreneurial business he has.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Chanel and Mizrahi declined to reveal Mizrahi's volume,
market sources said the business generated annual sales of roughly
$50 million before the Isaac bridge line was closed last year.
Isaac was believed to have accounted for less than half of the
business.
</P>
<P>
   Rena declined to say how much Chanel had invested in the Mizrahi
business in the last six years, but confirmed Chanel had ``lost
money'' on its overall investment.
</P>
<P>
   The Mizrahi business was profitable in the early years of the
partnership, he added, but it has lost money every year since the
launch of the bridge line in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Rena said the dissolution of the partnership, which also
involves several minority investors, will take several weeks to
complete.
</P>
<P>
   At present, the Isaac Mizrahi name is owned by the partnership,
but Rena said Chanel plans to divest itself of that property.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not use his name,'' he said. ``I'm sure some
arrangement will be made so he's going to be able to use it. It's
all being sorted out.''
</P>
<P>
   Rena said Chanel had high hopes the Isaac bridge business would
pump up volume for the brand, but it did not achieve its goals.
</P>
<P>
   After Isaac was shut down, ``it was down to the collection line,
which is a fairly small business, and it didn't make sense for us
to go on,'' he added. ``It's really too small for a company like
ours.''
</P>
<P>
   A source close to the designer said an Isaac Mizrahi fragrance
had been in development, but was stopped because Chanel did not
want to make the necessary investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I honestly don't think the Isaac Mizrahi business was given a
fair shake,'' the source said. ``The clothes were great. The
personality was great. It's pitiful that one couldn't capitalize on
those assets and make it a viable company. The timing was not right
to support the company at a critical point.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Mizrahi's deepening interest in entertainment projects
was a distraction that irritated Chanel, Rena said the company
always understood Mizrahi had such leanings. ``They were part of
his mystique.''
</P>
<P>
   Mizrahi has been a darling of the media and the fashion press
ever since he burst onto the fashion scene as a precocious
26-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to that, he had been a student at Parsons, then worked at
Perry Ellis, Jeffrey Banks and Calvin Klein.
</P>
<P>
   Famous for his theatrical, high-energy fashion shows and for
clothes as ebullient and colorful as his personality, Mizrahi
brought zing and glamour to fashion. His sense of humor and levity
was infectious.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unzipped,'' a documentary, was probably the first fashion film
to become a mainstream hit, thanks to Mizrahi's razor-sharp wit and
campy humor.
</P>
<P>
   Mizrahi's interests in entertainment have intensified ever
since. He recently formed a new production company called Baby with
his friend and colleague Nina Santisi, who has been vice president
of public relations and advertising at his company since its
inception.
</P>
<P>
   Santisi was executive producer of _ and featured prominently in
_ ``Unzipped.''
</P>
<P>
   Mizrahi, who currently can be seen in the new Woody Allen film
``Celebrity,'' said on Oct. 1 that he has missed opportunities in
the entertainment field because of his commitments to the fashion
house. He said these included starring roles in motion pictures,
but declined to name them. He said he had been offered a cameo
appearance ``in a movie that has since become a major hit. It had
actresses I really would have loved to work with.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mizrahi said he had to pass because the movie would have
required a commitment of three weeks to three months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I'm just so open to any kind of offers,'' he said. ``As I
see my life, I can't imagine what it would have been like not to do
these projects.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was becoming tired of fashion, Mizrahi said he has
been ``more and more in love with it'' lately. ``The ironic thing
is, it was really working. This fall and this past spring,
everything was really working and really selling well. It's a
roller coaster of a business. Sometimes it stinks; sometimes it's
great. This past year has been a red-letter year.''
</P>
<P>
   But he did hint at some frustrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fashion is a very funny thing, because it has so much to do
with sales. In fact, it's a greater art form. It hits you right in
the face with the moment. I feel like it's influencing art so much.
I don't think you could have had Jeff Koons in the Fifties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now art is supposed to be so much about a reflection. Before
it was a prediction. Now fashion is a prediction, and art is a
reflection. That's a bold thing to say, but it's very, very true.''
</P>
<P>
   Rick Rector, president of Isaac Mizrahi, said he would continue
to be employed by Mizrahi and Chanel to help wind down the
business. He said he and a small team of employees would remain
during the transition period.
</P>
<P>
   At present, Mizrahi has five licensing partners: Eyeota for
eyewear, FJ Benjamin Holdings Ltd. for handbags and leather
accessories, Lazare Kaplan for fine jewelry, Fairbrooke Enterprises
for coats and GFW Footwear for shoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in conversations with the licensees regarding the
future of those businesses, and those plans will be announced when
they're finalized,'' Rector said.
</P>
<P>
   Retail executives said they were shocked at Mizrahi's news. For
the most part, buyers reported, the signature collection was doing
well.
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, pointed out Mizrahi's creative designs might
have been a little too out of sync with what consumers really
wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am totally surprised,'' said Kal Ruttenstein, senior vice
president of fashion direction at Bloomingdale's, noting the store
had just brought back the label for fall at its flagship, after a
hiatus of a few seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a small parting of ways,'' he explained. ``A couple of
seasons ago, we moved the location, but it wasn't working. We
decided that until we came up with the right location, we would
take a little breather.''
</P>
<P>
   For fall, Bloomingdale's expanded Mizrahi's real estate to 700
square feet from 500 square feet, and moved it to a more visible
spot.
</P>
<P>
   Ruttenstein said the Mizrahi collection was doing well this
season, particularly the camel group of peajackets, long skirts and
cashmere sweaters. He added that Mizrahi's bridge label, which
closed last year, had done just ``OK.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a big mover and shaker in the industry,'' Ruttenstein
said. ``He brought back a fresh insouciance and a fresh, casual
elegance. He looked back to the movie stars, but he brought an
American contemporary feeling to the clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruttenstein said Bloomingdale's was the first store to buy
Mizrahi's collection when the designer started back in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember he had just left Perry Ellis, and he called me,''
he recalled. ``I went to see him. He did these velveteen powder
blue jump suits, and I immediately placed an order. We even
showcased the line in our windows. He was a big fan ever since. He
was one of the great showmen when it came to putting on a fashion
show.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, my lord, I can't believe it,'' said Joan Weinstein,
president of Chicago-based Ultimo, which carries the Mizrahi
merchandise in its three designer stores. ``I have to say that our
selection of (Mizrahi) has always done well,'' she added. ``We have
always had a consistent presence in the store.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Mizrahi's bestsellers this season have been sleeveless
cashmere pastel sweaters with scarves to match, inverted
front-pleated skirts and midcalf skirts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a fabulous person,'' Weinstein said.``He used to make
personal appearances at the store about twice a year. Everyone
loved him. He stopped doing it last year.'' She added, ``Knowing
Isaac, he'll bounce back.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am totally shocked,'' said Joseph Boitano, executive vice
president at Bergdorf Goodman, which had sold the collection since
Mizrahi came on the scene.
</P>
<P>
   The store devoted a 400-square-foot area to it. Boitano admitted
the store had some problems with the Isaac bridge line, but the
signature collection has done well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always had a nice business,'' he said. ``He had a great
following in the store.''
</P>
<P>
   Bergdorf Goodman has done especially well with Mizrahi's simple
short cocktail dresses this season. But one buyer from a designer
boutique, who wanted to remain anonymous, said her Mizrahi business
has been difficult in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It did really well, but then business got tough,'' she said.
``I think what happened was he did what he wanted, and the
consumers just didn't get it. That was the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Another buyer, who also did not want to be named, said he had to
drop the line last year after poor sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very creative and had such a great personality,'' he
said. ``But his collection was too outside the box for our
consumer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Isaac danced to the beat of his own drummer,'' said Sherry
Cassin, executive fashion director at the Doneger Group, a buying
office here. ``He was clearly not for the masses. He was very
special and did his own thing. He never wanted to sell out to mass
commercialism, but that, I guess, may have not been a good
long-term decision in the end.'' &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Isaac Mizrahi dropped a fashion bombshell on Oct. 1:
He said his 10-year-old business is closing.
</P>
<P>
   Mizrahi, a designer whose ebullient personality matched his
colorful clothing, said his partnership with Chanel was being
dissolved.
</P>
<P>
   Chanel, which has backed the business since 1992, is said to
have become increasingly impatient with its mounting losses.
</P>
<P>
   There will be no spring 1999 Isaac Mizrahi Collection, and the
Isaac Mizrahi &AMP; Co. headquarters on Wooster Street in SoHo soon
will go dark.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little shocking, but that's life,'' an
uncharacteristically rueful Mizrahi told WWD just hours after he
broke the news to about 55 employees. ``It's all for the best. It's
a good decision, as painful as it was to make. I'm taking a break
and observing what fate has to offer me now. I feel very excited
about the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Mizrahi said it was a ``joint decision'' with Chanel to shut
down his fashion business. He said initially he plans to
concentrate on a multitude of ``promising'' entertainment ventures,
including film production and screenwriting. He's working on a
movie optioned by Dreamworks based on his comic book, ``The
Adventures of Sandee the Supermodel.''
</P>
<P>
   He's also writing the third draft of a screenplay entitled
``Wild About Harry'' that has been optioned by Barry Sonnenfeld and
Disney; Mizrahi said he might star in it. He did not say
definitively if or when he would get back into the fashion
business.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was searching for new financial backers to relaunch
a fashion business, he said he was not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up to this point, my first commitment has been to fashion, but
now I don't know,'' he said, sitting at the desk where he has done
dozens of interviews and where he was filmed for the 1995 movie
``Unzipped'' that catapulted him to fashion fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will always have a great love of fashion,'' he said. ``I
will always be a fashion designer, but I don't know what form it's
going to take. I'm really at this crossroads, and I'm going to
allow fate to take over. I can't fight fate. It's been the driving
force of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Seemingly as bewildered by his shocking announcement as the
fashion world, Mizrahi declined to predict what his future will
hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a psychic. I don't know what I'm going to come back
as,'' he said. ``I don't envision myself six months from now or six
years from now. I just do. I solve creative problems. Right now,
what I want to do has to be culturally sound, whatever I do next.''
</P>
<P>
   News of the shutdown comes less than nine months after Mizrahi
closed his two-year-old Isaac bridge line, a venture initially
heralded as an enormous growth opportunity for the brand.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, about 65 workers were laid off at Mizrahi's SoHo
headquarters and its warehouse in Secaucus, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Chanel said on Oct. 1 that it is withdrawing its financial
backing because the Mizrahi's business volume was not large enough
to warrant Chanel's stake, which is believed to be approximately 70
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're dissolving the partnership,'' said Michael Rena,
executive vice president of Chanel Inc. ``The volume was not big
enough to make it interesting for us or him to continue. He doesn't
need us. He doesn't need backers to have the kind of
entrepreneurial business he has.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Chanel and Mizrahi declined to reveal Mizrahi's volume,
market sources said the business generated annual sales of roughly
$50 million before the Isaac bridge line was closed last year.
Isaac was believed to have accounted for less than half of the
business.
</P>
<P>
   Rena declined to say how much Chanel had invested in the Mizrahi
business in the last six years, but confirmed Chanel had ``lost
money'' on its overall investment.
</P>
<P>
   The Mizrahi business was profitable in the early years of the
partnership, he added, but it has lost money every year since the
launch of the bridge line in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Rena said the dissolution of the partnership, which also
involves several minority investors, will take several weeks to
complete.
</P>
<P>
   At present, the Isaac Mizrahi name is owned by the partnership,
but Rena said Chanel plans to divest itself of that property.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not use his name,'' he said. ``I'm sure some
arrangement will be made so he's going to be able to use it. It's
all being sorted out.''
</P>
<P>
   Rena said Chanel had high hopes the Isaac bridge business would
pump up volume for the brand, but it did not achieve its goals.
</P>
<P>
   After Isaac was shut down, ``it was down to the collection line,
which is a fairly small business, and it didn't make sense for us
to go on,'' he added. ``It's really too small for a company like
ours.''
</P>
<P>
   A source close to the designer said an Isaac Mizrahi fragrance
had been in development, but was stopped because Chanel did not
want to make the necessary investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I honestly don't think the Isaac Mizrahi business was given a
fair shake,'' the source said. ``The clothes were great. The
personality was great. It's pitiful that one couldn't capitalize on
those assets and make it a viable company. The timing was not right
to support the company at a critical point.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Mizrahi's deepening interest in entertainment projects
was a distraction that irritated Chanel, Rena said the company
always understood Mizrahi had such leanings. ``They were part of
his mystique.''
</P>
<P>
   Mizrahi has been a darling of the media and the fashion press
ever since he burst onto the fashion scene as a precocious
26-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to that, he had been a student at Parsons, then worked at
Perry Ellis, Jeffrey Banks and Calvin Klein.
</P>
<P>
   Famous for his theatrical, high-energy fashion shows and for
clothes as ebullient and colorful as his personality, Mizrahi
brought zing and glamour to fashion. His sense of humor and levity
was infectious.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unzipped,'' a documentary, was probably the first fashion film
to become a mainstream hit, thanks to Mizrahi's razor-sharp wit and
campy humor.
</P>
<P>
   Mizrahi's interests in entertainment have intensified ever
since. He recently formed a new production company called Baby with
his friend and colleague Nina Santisi, who has been vice president
of public relations and advertising at his company since its
inception.
</P>
<P>
   Santisi was executive producer of _ and featured prominently in
_ ``Unzipped.''
</P>
<P>
   Mizrahi, who currently can be seen in the new Woody Allen film
``Celebrity,'' said on Oct. 1 that he has missed opportunities in
the entertainment field because of his commitments to the fashion
house. He said these included starring roles in motion pictures,
but declined to name them. He said he had been offered a cameo
appearance ``in a movie that has since become a major hit. It had
actresses I really would have loved to work with.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mizrahi said he had to pass because the movie would have
required a commitment of three weeks to three months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I'm just so open to any kind of offers,'' he said. ``As I
see my life, I can't imagine what it would have been like not to do
these projects.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was becoming tired of fashion, Mizrahi said he has
been ``more and more in love with it'' lately. ``The ironic thing
is, it was really working. This fall and this past spring,
everything was really working and really selling well. It's a
roller coaster of a business. Sometimes it stinks; sometimes it's
great. This past year has been a red-letter year.''
</P>
<P>
   But he did hint at some frustrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fashion is a very funny thing, because it has so much to do
with sales. In fact, it's a greater art form. It hits you right in
the face with the moment. I feel like it's influencing art so much.
I don't think you could have had Jeff Koons in the Fifties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now art is supposed to be so much about a reflection. Before
it was a prediction. Now fashion is a prediction, and art is a
reflection. That's a bold thing to say, but it's very, very true.''
</P>
<P>
   Rick Rector, president of Isaac Mizrahi, said he would continue
to be employed by Mizrahi and Chanel to help wind down the
business. He said he and a small team of employees would remain
during the transition period.
</P>
<P>
   At present, Mizrahi has five licensing partners: Eyeota for
eyewear, FJ Benjamin Holdings Ltd. for handbags and leather
accessories, Lazare Kaplan for fine jewelry, Fairbrooke Enterprises
for coats and GFW Footwear for shoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in conversations with the licensees regarding the
future of those businesses, and those plans will be announced when
they're finalized,'' Rector said.
</P>
<P>
   Retail executives said they were shocked at Mizrahi's news. For
the most part, buyers reported, the signature collection was doing
well.
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, pointed out Mizrahi's creative designs might
have been a little too out of sync with what consumers really
wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am totally surprised,'' said Kal Ruttenstein, senior vice
president of fashion direction at Bloomingdale's, noting the store
had just brought back the label for fall at its flagship, after a
hiatus of a few seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a small parting of ways,'' he explained. ``A couple of
seasons ago, we moved the location, but it wasn't working. We
decided that until we came up with the right location, we would
take a little breather.''
</P>
<P>
   For fall, Bloomingdale's expanded Mizrahi's real estate to 700
square feet from 500 square feet, and moved it to a more visible
spot.
</P>
<P>
   Ruttenstein said the Mizrahi collection was doing well this
season, particularly the camel group of peajackets, long skirts and
cashmere sweaters. He added that Mizrahi's bridge label, which
closed last year, had done just ``OK.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a big mover and shaker in the industry,'' Ruttenstein
said. ``He brought back a fresh insouciance and a fresh, casual
elegance. He looked back to the movie stars, but he brought an
American contemporary feeling to the clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruttenstein said Bloomingdale's was the first store to buy
Mizrahi's collection when the designer started back in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember he had just left Perry Ellis, and he called me,''
he recalled. ``I went to see him. He did these velveteen powder
blue jump suits, and I immediately placed an order. We even
showcased the line in our windows. He was a big fan ever since. He
was one of the great showmen when it came to putting on a fashion
show.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, my lord, I can't believe it,'' said Joan Weinstein,
president of Chicago-based Ultimo, which carries the Mizrahi
merchandise in its three designer stores. ``I have to say that our
selection of (Mizrahi) has always done well,'' she added. ``We have
always had a consistent presence in the store.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Mizrahi's bestsellers this season have been sleeveless
cashmere pastel sweaters with scarves to match, inverted
front-pleated skirts and midcalf skirts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a fabulous person,'' Weinstein said.``He used to make
personal appearances at the store about twice a year. Everyone
loved him. He stopped doing it last year.'' She added, ``Knowing
Isaac, he'll bounce back.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am totally shocked,'' said Joseph Boitano, executive vice
president at Bergdorf Goodman, which had sold the collection since
Mizrahi came on the scene.
</P>
<P>
   The store devoted a 400-square-foot area to it. Boitano admitted
the store had some problems with the Isaac bridge line, but the
signature collection has done well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always had a nice business,'' he said. ``He had a great
following in the store.''
</P>
<P>
   Bergdorf Goodman has done especially well with Mizrahi's simple
short cocktail dresses this season. But one buyer from a designer
boutique, who wanted to remain anonymous, said her Mizrahi business
has been difficult in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It did really well, but then business got tough,'' she said.
``I think what happened was he did what he wanted, and the
consumers just didn't get it. That was the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Another buyer, who also did not want to be named, said he had to
drop the line last year after poor sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very creative and had such a great personality,'' he
said. ``But his collection was too outside the box for our
consumer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Isaac danced to the beat of his own drummer,'' said Sherry
Cassin, executive fashion director at the Doneger Group, a buying
office here. ``He was clearly not for the masses. He was very
special and did his own thing. He never wanted to sell out to mass
commercialism, but that, I guess, may have not been a good
long-term decision in the end.'' &QL;

COMPETITION FOR TEXAS PHONE CUSTOMERS JUST A SKIRMISH SO FAR
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanied by PHONE-CHALLENGES) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARK P. COUCH 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The contest for local phone customers in
North Texas kicked off with a gust of hot air last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Southwestern Bell, the state's largest local carrier, invaded
No. 2 GTE's turf in Plano and Irving, launching its
multimillion-dollar challenge to the entrenched monopoly at a
balloon rally.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when it began,'' says Carl Bracy, director of
competitive response for GTE.
</P>
<P>
   Remember the Plano Balloon Festival?
</P>
<P>
   It may not be a battle cry for the ages, but that September 1997
face-off between the two companies was supposed to fulfill the
promise of the new phone era _ local competition _ and set an
example for the rest of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the results have been disappointing to those who wanted
a model that could be transplanted to other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are saying it's an open market, but just because they say
it's open doesn't mean there is competition,'' says Leslie
Kjellstrand, spokeswoman for the Texas Public Utility Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``On what services are they competing?'' asks Janee
Briesemeister, telecommunications analyst for Consumers Union in
Austin. ``It is possible that they are cherry-picking only the most
lucrative residential customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Briesemeister says phone companies plucking off rich residential
customers doesn't accomplish the goal of lowering the cost of basic
telephone service for everyone. Those customers are buying more
expensive packages that include caller-ID, call-waiting and other
services.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're cream-skimming the residential market for those
households that use those services, but for basic services, there's
no competition,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Those basic services _ connection fees and monthly charges for
one phone line _ must come down before Briesemeister will concede
that a new era of competition has arrived.
</P>
<P>
   So far, those charges are the same in Irving and Plano as they
are elsewhere in the Metroplex. GTE's service representatives say
connection fees are $50 if a technician visits a customer's house,
and basic monthly service is $15. Southwestern Bell says it charges
$47 to connect and $15 a month for service.
</P>
<P>
   But what the Southwestern Bell incursion into GTE's market did
bring is a taste of what phone companies will do when they have to
sell local service as if it were laundry detergent or breakfast
cereal.
</P>
<P>
   The companies have begun programs to build brand loyalty and
extend name recognition.
</P>
<P>
   At Southwestern Bell, that meant ponying up $50,000 a year to
get its name on the popular Plano Balloon Festival, which draws as
many as 300,000 spectators.
</P>
<P>
   Southwestern Bell has the rights to the festival for the next
three years, says Jo Via, executive director of the festival.
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 festival coincided with Bell's invasion into the heart
of GTE's territory and also offered an opportunity to rattle GTE's
cage.
</P>
<P>
   ``GTE had been a lower-level sponsor for a number of years,''
Via says. ``We went to them because they had the right of first
refusal, and they turned it down.''
</P>
<P>
   Southwestern Bell has signed some other sponsorship deals, but
it doesn't need to break the bank because it already has a brand
name known to most residents, regional manager Mark Ruffin says.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were able to build on our name so we didn't have to spend a
lot on mass marketing,'' Ruffin says.
</P>
<P>
   As for GTE, it has revamped its product offerings and combined
services such as caller-ID and call-waiting into packages that
included bulk-buying discounts. Those packages include combinations
of three, five and 12 services and cost $5.25, $7.25 and $10.25 per
month, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   To market the packages, GTE sent information to the customers
who would be most likely to defect to Southwestern Bell.
</P>
<P>
   MORE
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't defeat the competition with more advertising,''
Bracy says. ``We decided not to destroy the other guy, but to
improve ourselves. That caused us to look at many things, like our
pricing programs and our customer service.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've started to look at this business much like any other
consumer-products company.''
</P>
<P>
   GTE also enrolled customers who bought the service into a raffle
for a new $165,000 house. The house, which could be anywhere in GTE
territory, was awarded to Rogelia Aguilar, who chose Rowlett.
</P>
<P>
   Southwestern Bell, on the other hand, is relying on direct sales
to attract customers. Ruffin says Bell is contacting customers who
can provide a high volume of calls, such as office complexes and
apartment buildings.
</P>
<P>
   In that way, Southwestern Bell is similar to smaller start-up
phone companies that target the lucrative niches of urban and
suburban markets. But Bell is aiming to blanket Plano and Irving,
not just pick up a few big customers.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Southwestern Bell has increased its revenues in Plano
and Irving by 50 percent, but Ruffin concedes that it was starting
from a small base. GTE estimates that it has retained 98 percent of
its residential customers in the two cities.
</P>
<P>
   While several companies are battling for lucrative pieces of the
pie, the competition for local customers hasn't swept into the rest
of North Texas. In Fort Worth and Arlington, residential customers
get Southwestern Bell, with few having any other choices.
</P>
<P>
   Bell still has a firm grip on most of its wires, too. The
Telecommunications Act of 1996 gives local phone companies
permission to sell long distance only after they open their systems
to competitors.
</P>
<P>
   According to records filed with the Federal Communications
Commission this year, only a small percentage of residential
customers in Texas are getting phone service on lines leased from
Bell or GTE.
</P>
<P>
   Southwestern Bell reported to the FCC that it has 5.9 million
lines to residential customers and 3.3 million lines to businesses,
schools and other nonresidential customers. It said it provides
195,000 residential lines to competitors and 88,000 to
nonresidential customers.
</P>
<P>
   GTE owns 1.3 million residential and 548,000 nonresidential
wires that it uses. It has 12,075 residential and 8,724
nonresidential wires that it leases to other companies.
</P>
<P>
   And despite the hoopla, many observers say they don't believe
that the phone fights in Plano and Irving are the way of future
competition because there are too many barriers blocking that path.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Vanston, president of Technology Futures in Austin and
a respected telecommunications seer, says local-service carriers
won't compete until they can find cheaper ways to reach into those
households.
</P>
<P>
   ``Excluding business areas and some very lucrative
neighborhoods, I would be very surprised to see head-to-head
competition between companies using traditional telecommunications
technology,'' Vanston says.
</P>
<P>
   It's too expensive and too risky for a company to plunk down the
wires and equipment it would need to serve a base of customers that
it can't guarantee. Those estimates range from at least $2,000 per
home to as much as $5,000 per home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will be very rare, except in major business
areas,'' Vanston says.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Kagan, a telecommunications analyst in Marietta, Ga.,
says some Bell companies are starting to strike out into their
sister company's regions, but it's not a common practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not widespread yet, but it's an emerging trend,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   Vanston says he believes that local phone companies are more
likely to expand their wireless and cable operations because they
offer more cost-effective ways to blanket local markets.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the local phone companies worry that small
firms will invade their markets to take pieces of the pie without
the requirements of serving the entire market.
</P>
<P>
   ``What keeps me awake at night is that there are so many people
out there competing for some of the same customers,'' Ruffin says.

WIRELESS, `CABLE VOICE' OFFER CHALLENGES
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanies PHONE COMPETITION) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are two major impending challenges to the local phone
companies: wireless and ``cable voice'' telephone systems.
</P>
<P>
   Wireless phone companies are cutting prices and boosting
coverage areas, and cable companies are speeding up improvements to
their systems to so they can send and receive information.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see voice service by wireless companies as attractive and
data by cable modem,'' says Lawrence Vanston, president of
Technology Futures in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Within 10 years, the local telephone companies will lose almost
40 percent of their revenues to companies selling local phone
service through alternative methods, Vanston predicts.
</P>
<P>
   But the local phone companies are holding their own right now.
</P>
<P>
   Few people have dropped their phones for wireless service, says
Liz Dunn, spokeswoman for AT&AMP;T Wireless, the nation's largest
wireless phone service.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't see it today as a big trend yet, but it's kind of
like `Watch this space for more details,' '' Dunn says.
</P>
<P>
   The cable TV industry is also planning to break into the local
phone business. AT&AMP;T is hedging its bets by buying huge cable
provider Tele-Communications Inc. of Englewood, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   ``AT&AMP;T made a $47 billion bet that it will happen in cable,''
says Larry Schutz, vice president of network engineering for
Charter Communications, a St. Louis-based cable provider.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Charter will become the second cable company in
Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen's stable of investments. Allen
bought Dallas-based Marcus Cable last spring, and it will be
consolidated with Charter when that deal is completed.
</P>
<P>
   Schutz says cable companies are pouring money into improvements
that will allow their systems to send voice signals over the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cable industry has been fervently and frantically
upgrading for the last five or six years,'' Schutz says. ``A number
of companies are within a year of having their systems capable of
handling the capacity.''

   But what the Southwestern Bell incursion into GTE's market did
bring is a taste of what phone companies will do when they have to
sell local service as if it were laundry detergent or breakfast
cereal.
</P>
<P>
   The companies have begun programs to build brand loyalty and
extend name recognition.
</P>
<P>
   At Southwestern Bell, that meant ponying up $50,000 a year to
get its name on the popular Plano Balloon Festival, which draws as
many as 300,000 spectators.
</P>
<P>
   Southwestern Bell has the rights to the festival for the next
three years, says Jo Via, executive director of the festival.
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 festival coincided with Bell's invasion into the heart
of GTE's territory and also offered an opportunity to rattle GTE's
cage.
</P>
<P>
   ``GTE had been a lower-level sponsor for a number of years,''
Via says. ``We went to them because they had the right of first
refusal, and they turned it down.''
</P>
<P>
   Southwestern Bell has signed some other sponsorship deals, but
it doesn't need to break the bank because it already has a brand
name known to most residents, regional manager Mark Ruffin says.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were able to build on our name so we didn't have to spend a
lot on mass marketing,'' Ruffin says.
</P>
<P>
   As for GTE, it has revamped its product offerings and combined
services such as caller-ID and call-waiting into packages that
included bulk-buying discounts. Those packages include combinations
of three, five and 12 services and cost $5.25, $7.25 and $10.25 per
month, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   To market the packages, GTE sent information to the customers
who would be most likely to defect to Southwestern Bell.
</P>
<P>
   MORE
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't defeat the competition with more advertising,''
Bracy says. ``We decided not to destroy the other guy, but to
improve ourselves. That caused us to look at many things, like our
pricing programs and our customer service.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've started to look at this business much like any other
consumer-products company.''
</P>
<P>
   GTE also enrolled customers who bought the service into a raffle
for a new $165,000 house. The house, which could be anywhere in GTE
territory, was awarded to Rogelia Aguilar, who chose Rowlett.
</P>
<P>
   Southwestern Bell, on the other hand, is relying on direct sales
to attract customers. Ruffin says Bell is contacting customers who
can provide a high volume of calls, such as office complexes and
apartment buildings.
</P>
<P>
   In that way, Southwestern Bell is similar to smaller start-up
phone companies that target the lucrative niches of urban and
suburban markets. But Bell is aiming to blanket Plano and Irving,
not just pick up a few big customers.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Southwestern Bell has increased its revenues in Plano
and Irving by 50 percent, but Ruffin concedes that it was starting
from a small base. GTE estimates that it has retained 98 percent of
its residential customers in the two cities.
</P>
<P>
   While several companies are battling for lucrative pieces of the
pie, the competition for local customers hasn't swept into the rest
of North Texas. In Fort Worth and Arlington, residential customers
get Southwestern Bell, with few having any other choices.
</P>
<P>
   Bell still has a firm grip on most of its wires, too. The
Telecommunications Act of 1996 gives local phone companies
permission to sell long distance only after they open their systems
to competitors.
</P>
<P>
   According to records filed with the Federal Communications
Commission this year, only a small percentage of residential
customers in Texas are getting phone service on lines leased from
Bell or GTE.
</P>
<P>
   Southwestern Bell reported to the FCC that it has 5.9 million
lines to residential customers and 3.3 million lines to businesses,
schools and other nonresidential customers. It said it provides
195,000 residential lines to competitors and 88,000 to
nonresidential customers.
</P>
<P>
   GTE owns 1.3 million residential and 548,000 nonresidential
wires that it uses. It has 12,075 residential and 8,724
nonresidential wires that it leases to other companies.
</P>
<P>
   And despite the hoopla, many observers say they don't believe
that the phone fights in Plano and Irving are the way of future
competition because there are too many barriers blocking that path.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Vanston, president of Technology Futures in Austin and
a respected telecommunications seer, says local-service carriers
won't compete until they can find cheaper ways to reach into those
households.
</P>
<P>
   ``Excluding business areas and some very lucrative
neighborhoods, I would be very surprised to see head-to-head
competition between companies using traditional telecommunications
technology,'' Vanston says.
</P>
<P>
   It's too expensive and too risky for a company to plunk down the
wires and equipment it would need to serve a base of customers that
it can't guarantee. Those estimates range from at least $2,000 per
home to as much as $5,000 per home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will be very rare, except in major business
areas,'' Vanston says.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Kagan, a telecommunications analyst in Marietta, Ga.,
says some Bell companies are starting to strike out into their
sister company's regions, but it's not a common practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not widespread yet, but it's an emerging trend,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   Vanston says he believes that local phone companies are more
likely to expand their wireless and cable operations because they
offer more cost-effective ways to blanket local markets.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the local phone companies worry that small
firms will invade their markets to take pieces of the pie without
the requirements of serving the entire market.
</P>
<P>
   ``What keeps me awake at night is that there are so many people
out there competing for some of the same customers,'' Ruffin says.

WIRELESS, `CABLE VOICE' OFFER CHALLENGES
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanies PHONE COMPETITION) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are two major impending challenges to the local phone
companies: wireless and ``cable voice'' telephone systems.
</P>
<P>
   Wireless phone companies are cutting prices and boosting
coverage areas, and cable companies are speeding up improvements to
their systems to so they can send and receive information.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see voice service by wireless companies as attractive and
data by cable modem,'' says Lawrence Vanston, president of
Technology Futures in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Within 10 years, the local telephone companies will lose almost
40 percent of their revenues to companies selling local phone
service through alternative methods, Vanston predicts.
</P>
<P>
   But the local phone companies are holding their own right now.
</P>
<P>
   Few people have dropped their phones for wireless service, says
Liz Dunn, spokeswoman for AT&AMP;T Wireless, the nation's largest
wireless phone service.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't see it today as a big trend yet, but it's kind of
like `Watch this space for more details,' '' Dunn says.
</P>
<P>
   The cable TV industry is also planning to break into the local
phone business. AT&AMP;T is hedging its bets by buying huge cable
provider Tele-Communications Inc. of Englewood, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   ``AT&AMP;T made a $47 billion bet that it will happen in cable,''
says Larry Schutz, vice president of network engineering for
Charter Communications, a St. Louis-based cable provider.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Charter will become the second cable company in
Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen's stable of investments. Allen
bought Dallas-based Marcus Cable last spring, and it will be
consolidated with Charter when that deal is completed.
</P>
<P>
   Schutz says cable companies are pouring money into improvements
that will allow their systems to send voice signals over the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cable industry has been fervently and frantically
upgrading for the last five or six years,'' Schutz says. ``A number
of companies are within a year of having their systems capable of
handling the capacity.''

LEYRITZ A PLAYOFF SPECIALIST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Rangers and Boston Red Sox gnash their teeth at
what might have been. The Houston Astros weep at what was done to
them.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Braves tremble at his approach.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Leyritz is in town with the San Diego Padres, a one-man
wrecking crew ready to wreak havoc on the Braves in the National
League Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   If he gets off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's unbelievable,'' Braves pitcher Denny Neagle said. ``Some
guys seem to rise to the occasion. He's one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Padres' backup catcher/first baseman, who isn't in tonight's
starting lineup, is suddenly being ranked with Reggie Jackson,
Mickey Mantle and Babe Ruth as one of the greatest clutch hitters
in postseason history. Six home runs in just 36 at-bats will do
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always joked that I get paid for April and October,''
Leyritz said. ``April, most of the guys are hurt out of spring
training and I get to play a little more, and October I've had some
success. I've never been an everyday player and every game I've
been in has been kind of a World Series for me personally because I
had to perform if I wanted to play again.''
</P>
<P>
   Leyritz's latest heroics were three key home runs in the Padres'
division series against the Astros. It didn't go unnoticed that his
two previous teams, the Rangers and Red Sox, were knocked out in
the first round in part because of a lack of offense.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers have an excuse. They used Leyritz to acquire 19-game
winner Aaron Sele and wouldn't have been in the playoffs without
him. The Red Sox dumped Leyritz on June 21 for three
minor-leaguers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boston might have wanted me to be there,'' Leyritz said. ``A
couple of guys on the team I talked to before the playoffs, they
said, `We wish you were still here.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But Leyritz clashed with manager Jimy Williams because he felt
he wasn't getting enough playing time. After being taken out of one
game, Leyritz was reportedly heard going up the tunnel to the
clubhouse screaming, ``Hasn't he heard of Mark Wohlers?''
</P>
<P>
   Wohlers is the Braves' reliever who gave up a three-run homer to
Leyritz in Game 4 of the 1996 World Series. The eighth-inning blow
erased the Braves' 6-3 lead and the Yankees won the pivotal game in
extra innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think his makeup allows him to do what he does in
postseason,'' Padres manager Bruce Bochy said. ``It's obvious he's
very relaxed and wants to be up there when the game is on the line.
He enjoys the moment. He's not affected by anything.''

BOCHY GOES WITH ASHBY OVER BROWN IN GAME 1
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Padres manager Bruce Bochy decided to go with All-Star
right-hander Andy Ashby in Game 1 instead of bringing back Kevin
Brown on three days' rest. Bochy used Brown in the division series
against the Houston Astros on three days' rest but didn't want to
push his ace any further. Brown is scheduled for tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt the way to go here was Andy Ashby,'' Bochy said. ``A
big reason we're in this situation is because the year Andy has
had. He's fresh, he's ready to go and I don't see any reason to
push Kevin Brown too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Rain is a possibility for today, meaning if the game is
postponed, Bochy could start Brown in Game 1 tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying anything about rain right now,'' Bochy said.
``I'm not thinking about that. Andy Ashby, he's going the first
game, and that's where we're at right now.'' &QL; 
BRAVES DOWNPLAY EXPERIENCE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Braves have played 75 postseason games since 1991. The
Padres have played seven. But the Braves insist that experience
won't be a big advantage, perhaps remembering what happened last
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year was our sixth consecutive League Championship
Series, and we were playing the expansion Florida Marlins and it
didn't matter,'' general manager John Schuerholz said. ``It just
depends on who's playing the best, who's pitching the best, who's
hitting the best, who's making the fewest critical mistakes and
errors. An inexperienced team like the Padres who are playing good
and have their confidence up can make up for whatever lack of
experience they have.''
</P>
<P>
   Padres outfielder Tony Gwynn said, ``It's going to be a
challenge. I said all year the road leads through Atlanta and
you've got to find a way to beat them. It's not going to be easy,
but it hasn't been easy all year.'' &QL; 
TICKETS AVAILABLE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pennant fever is not overwhelming Atlanta right now. As of
yesterday, 5,000 tickets were available for each LCS game.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is the Braves are having to share the October
spotlight with the 3-1 Atlanta Falcons, 3-1 Georgia Tech and the
undefeated Georgia Bulldogs, who are ranked seventh in the country
and play No. 4 Tennessee on Saturday. The biggest story in Monday's
``Atlanta Constitution'' sports section was the season-ending
injury to Tennessee running back Jamal Lewis. &QL; 
KEY TO VICTORY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Braves manager Bobby Cox said there's one key to stopping the
Padres' offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keep them off base in front of Tony'' Gwynn,'' Cox said.
``That's what Hank Aaron said this morning, so that's good enough
for me.'' &QL; 
COX MIFFED &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cox seemed miffed yesterday about all the attention being given
to Padres pitcher Kevin Brown and super-sub Jim Leyritz because of
their past successes against the Braves. Brown beat the Braves
twice in the NLCS last year, and Leyritz had a big home run against
them in the 1996 World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Brown, Cox said, ``Kevin Brown is a thorn in
everybody's side, but so is our starting rotation.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he has seen anybody who gets up for the playoffs like
Leyritz, Cox said, ``Yeah, 25 guys on our side.''

PLAYOFF SUCCESS MAY DECIDE PADRES' FUTURE IN SAN DIEGO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The San Diego Padres take heart knowing the Florida
Marlins knocked off the Atlanta Braves last year in the National
League Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres also know what happened after the Marlins won the
World Series. Without any chance of getting a new stadium, Marlins
owner Wayne Huizenga turned around and dismantled his team to the
point where they were the worst in baseball this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres, as they prepare to face the Braves tonight in the
NLCS, know their franchise could face upheaval if a new stadium
isn't approved in a Nov. 3 referendum. They've been banking on a
strong run through the playoffs to help push the vote through.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you'll ever see what happened in Florida,''
Padres general manager Kevin Towers said yesterday while watching
his team workout at Turner Field. ``My biggest fear is I don't
think there's a better city in the country than San Diego and I'd
hate to see the franchise have to move. But without putting words
into someone's mouth, I would imagine we'd be in a race with
someone for Northern Virginia if this thing doesn't pass.''
</P>
<P>
   The Padres currently play at Qualcomm Stadium, a multi-purpose
facility they share with the NFL's San Diego Chargers. They're
asking voters to approve a $400 million downtown baseball-only
ballpark that they insist will secure a competitive future in San
Diego.
</P>
<P>
   If the vote fails, they fear the work that has been done to
transform the Padres from one of baseball's worst franchises into a
respected one will come unraveled. Remember this is the franchise
that had Roseanne Barr sing the national anthem and pitcher Rich
Gossage accuse owner Joan Kroc of poisoning the country with
McDonald's hamburgers.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres have come far under owner John Moores from the days
when owner Tom Werner, the Hollywood mogul who made Roseanne
famous, had to unload Fred McGriff, Gary Sheffield, Benito
Santiago, Andy Benes, Bruce Hurst and Randy Myers to keep the books
balanced.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres hit rock bottom from 1993 through 1994 with a record
of 108-171 that was the worst in baseball. Moores took over the
team on Dec. 21, 1994, installed former Orioles boss Larry Lucchino
as club president and within two years, the Padres were NL West
champions.
</P>
<P>
   A 12-player trade with the Houston Astros brought in outfielder
Steve Finley and third baseman Ken Caminiti. First baseman Wally
Joyner was acquired from the Kansas City Royals, second baseman
Quilvio Veras from Florida and pitcher Sterling Hitchcock from the
Seattle Mariners. Greg Vaughn was acquired from the Milwaukee
Brewers during the 1996 pennant drive.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest move made by Towers came last off-season. Fighting
off competition from almost every other big-market club, he
acquired pitcher Kevin Brown from the Marlins for three
minor-leaguers.
</P>
<P>
   That showed the Padres, who had fallen to 76-86 in 1997, were
serious about doing everything they could to win this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kevin Brown has had an enormous impact on this team,
pitching-wise,'' outfielder Tony Gwynn said. ``That's why we're
better suited for a run in the playoffs this year.''
</P>
<P>
   But Brown is a free agent, along with Finley, Joyner, Caminiti
and catcher Carlos Hernandez. The Padres need to either re-sign
them or replace them with comparable talent to remain competitive.
The stadium issue could decide that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if it does pass, it's unlikely we'll be able to re-sign
all five,'' Towers said. ``But the stadium is very important for
the ballclub to stay competitive and attract top-notch free agents
and keep the payroll in the $50 million range. Once again, you look
at the playoffs and it's the clubs with at least $50 million
payrolls who are in.''
</P>
<P>
   The Padres have already created enough excitement this season to
boost their chances of getting a new stadium. A trip to the World
Series wouldn't hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we do hopefully does help out,'' manager Bruce Bochy
said. ``We know a winning season can create more interest in San
Diego. But these are things we can't be concerned with. Our concern
has to be on the field, and that's what we're thinking about.
Hopefully the stadium issue is settled in November and when people
vote, they vote for the right reasons.''

STARS PERPLEXED BY POWER OUTAGES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The numbers are both stunning and perplexing.
</P>
<P>
   Either the Stars have the most talented power play in the NHL,
one that could challenge franchise and league records this season,
or they have a group that has to prove it can score when games
really matter.
</P>
<P>
   The reality is probably a little of both.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's got a chance to be really, really good this year, there's
no doubt,'' winger Pat Verbeek said of the power play. ``At the
same time, it was really, really good last year until the end.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars led the league last season with 77 power-play goals in
82 games, hitting on 20 percent of their scoring opportunities with
the man advantage. In the end, though, when the Stars' needed their
NHL-leading power play to match the Detroit Red Wings in the
Western Conference playoffs, the result was a 1-for-30 outing over
six games.
</P>
<P>
   In the low-scoring series, the Stars were outscored 15-11, and
at the heart of that difference was a 4-1 disadvantage in
power-play situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a huge part of the game, especially if they're calling
more penalties this year,'' said Brett Hull, the newly acquired
winger who could be the key to improving the power play this season
and postseason. ``Every time you're out there, it's a chance to
change the game.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Stars seem ready to change a number of games this
season. Through eight preseason games, the Stars scored 13
power-play goals on 53 chances with the man advantage. That's a
jump from 20 to 24.5 percent. More amazingly, it's a jump in
power-play goals per game of 72.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Now, those numbers have to be taken with a grain of salt. The
Stars played four games against Tampa Bay and Nashville, two of the
worst teams in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   That said, they scored at a pace that would have produced 133
goals in 82 games. That would have shattered the NHL record for
power-play goals in a season, the 119 by the Pittsburgh Penguins in
1988-89.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty incredible what they've been able to do,''
defenseman Derian Hatcher said. ``And when you consider what will
happen when Joe /RNieuwendyk/S comes back, it'll be pretty tough to
stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Key to the unit is defenseman Sergei Zubov, who quarterbacks the
power play from the right point and uses his passing skills to get
the puck into the scoring areas. Defenseman Darryl Sydor mans the
left point and offers a simple alternative to Zubov's slick passes.
Sydor makes quick plays and takes a lot of shots on goal. Rebounds
off those shots often turn into easy goals for the forwards.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Modano will likely man the ``half wall,'' a spot outside
the right circle near the boards, while Jere Lehtinen will be
relied on heavily to dig loose pucks and pounce on rebounds in
front of the net. That leaves Hull to free-lance, setting up in the
slot to release one of the hardest shots in the league from 20 to
30 feet or ``flashing'' in front of the net to deflect shots from
Zubov or Sydor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way he buzzes around in there, /Ran opposing defenseman/S
can lose him real easy,'' Sydor said. ``He doesn't just set up; he
moves in front of the goalie, and you never know where he's going
to be next. Plus, he's got great hands and can make some incredible
tips.''
</P>
<P>
   If that unit of five doesn't get the job done, coach Ken
Hitchcock can send out a second line that will likely include
Nieuwendyk, Verbeek and Jamie Langenbrunner. Sydor and Zubov can
stay at the points or Shawn Chambers, Derian Hatcher or Richard
Matvichuk can step in. What's more, the 6-foot-5, 225-pound Hatcher
can be moved to the front of the net to set one of the biggest
screens in the NHL.
</P>

   The Stars assigned wingers David Roberts and Jon Sim to their

NBA LABOR STRIFE PUTS MAVERICKS' NELSON ON HOLD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By RICHIE WHITT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ For the first time in 37 years as an NBA player,
general manager and coach, Don Nelson yesterday opened a training
camp alone.
</P>
<P>
   Sort of.
</P>
<P>
   Just as he was supposed to on the first official day of the NBA
season, the Mavericks' coach took the court at the Baylor-Landry
Center and barked instructions to a group of young, eager players.
But in these uncharted waters of a league-wide lockout, the
whistle-blowing was playful instead of piercing, and the players
were fifth-graders instead of multimillionaires.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mind and body are ready to go, like they always are this
time of year,'' Nelson said. ``It's frustrating because there's
nothing to do. It's boring.''
</P>
<P>
   With his Mavericks either playing overseas, drumming up support
by signing autographs, or picketing NBA sites across the country,
Nelson was host to a clinic for more than 200 Dallas-area children
with outstanding academic achievements. With the labor strife
having already canceled all 114 preseason games and severely
threatening the Nov. 3 start of the regular season, Nelson knows he
better invent ways to keep himself occupied.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll try to stay busy and bide our time by doing some
positive things like this out in the community,'' said Nelson, who
spent yesterday morning playing in a charity golf tournament. ``But
our preparations are done. We're just ready and waiting.''
</P>
<P>
   While players and ownersnegotiate today and wait for arbitrator
John Feerick's crucial ruling, which will come before Oct. 18, the
Mavericks try to conduct business as usual.
</P>
<P>
   Phones are being answered, team programs are getting finishing
touches and tickets are being sold at Reunion Arena. In fact,
despite last season's 20-62 disaster and the uncertainty of the
lockout, the Mavericks expect an increase in season tickets (from
last season's 8,600) for the first time since 1995-96. Those
tickets, of course, will have to be refunded if the lockout cancels
games for the first time in the NBA's 52-year history.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson, as per lockout rules, hasn't had contact with
second-year forward Chris Anstey, spending the summer playing in
Australia. Or with rookie Dirk Nowitzki, a first-round draft pick
averaging 12 points per game playing for a team called the X-Rays
in Germany. Nor has Nelson been able to put new point guard Steve
Nash on the court or negotiate with desirable free agents Kurt
Thomas or Cedric Ceballos.
</P>
<P>
   The only indirect contact teams may have with players is the
forwarding of their mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until either side starts losing money, nothing will get
done,'' Ceballos said. ``Like everybody else, I'm just waiting.''
</P>
<P>
   The impasse _ basically over the owners' desire for a hard
salary cap and the players' demand to retain their lucrative cap
loophole _ could turn on Feerick's decision. If he rules that the
220 players with guaranteed contracts be paid even during the
lockout, the owners could quickly crumble.
</P>
<P>
   ``They sure won't pay us to sit around and be locked out will
they?'' said Seattle SuperSonics point guard Gary Payton.
</P>
<P>
   But if Feerick rules for the owners, solidarity in the players'
union could begin cracking as players making minimum salaries start
missing paychecks. While owners will soon receive monetary relief
in the form of the first installment of their new $2.6 billion
television deal, the players' union is busy organizing exhibition
games in Europe and Japan to generate emergency funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still pretty laid-back,'' Orlando Magic guard Penny
Hardaway said. ``But we're starting to get on the edge of our
seats. We're getting antsy to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Dallas wasn't one of the targeted cities _ like Houston, New
York and Portland, Ore. _ for player picketing yesterday. Instead,
it was the site of a clinic Nelson hopes to hold every Tuesday and
Thursday through this month, ultimately reaching 2,000 youths.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not surprised it's at this point because all the news has
been bleak,'' said Nelson, who arrived in town from his annual
summer sabbatical in Maui on Sept. 18. ``Scared isn't a good word.
We're just some of the members in waiting.''
</P>
<P>
   When _ and if _ an agreement is reached, teams probably will
need three weeks to sign free agents, make trades and get players
in shape for a regular-season that could be sliced to as few as 50
games. The Mavericks, who have already had two preseason home games
canceled and were forced to pull out of two summer leagues, are
scheduled to open the season in Orlando, Fla., in less than four
weeks.

THE APPLE OF YOUR EYE: SPLASH OF CIDER ADDS CREATIVITY TO COOKING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DOUG BLACKBURN  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ We all know what an apple a day is purported to
do, but apples are much more than the foundation of good health
care. They are also one of the most versatile fruits _ a juicy,
flavorful ingredient in everything from chutneys to pies.
</P>
<P>
   Guess what? That cider sitting in your refrigerator is almost as
adaptable, and probably more underused than the apples from which
it was created.
</P>
<P>
   Cider isn't only a beverage. It can be a wonderful addition to
cooking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think apple cider is inexhaustible,'' said Greg Patent,
whose book, ``A Is for Apple,'' is scheduled to be published by
Broadway Books next year. ``It has incredible potential as an
ingredient in marinades and sauces.''
</P>
<P>
   Patent, a contributing editor at Cooking Light magazine, wrote a
story on cooking with cider for the October issue. Cider, he
contends, works in a variety of ways.
</P>
<P>
   Call these the cider-house rules. Cider is both sweet and
acidic, which makes it extremely accommodating, Patent said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It works really well with meats. I like to use both the sweet
and hard as a marinade,'' he said. ``If I'm using the sweet cider
as a marinade, I'll finish off the sauce with hard cider. It tends
to accentuate the sweetness of a meat like lamb. I've also used it
with goose, pheasant, pork and beef.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think hard cider would be a good basis to use in a soup. You
have beer and cheese soup. I think if you replace the beer with
hard cider the results would be similar, yet refreshing. The hard
cider acts more like a champagne, because it's effervescent and has
an undercurrent of sweetness.''
</P>
<P>
   Cider also works with greens, especially if it's boiled down,
Patent said. He provided a recipe for New Age Waldorf Salad that
calls for two cups of apple cider to be boiled down to one-half cup
before it is mixed with yogurt and celery seeds for the dressing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boiling cider can really concentrate its flavor, making it
taste more apple-like than anything else,'' he said. ``Reduced
ciders open up a whole new realm of cooking possibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooking with cider may be a centuries-old New England tradition
that is being revived, if Patent's research is on target.
</P>
<P>
   The Pilgrims arrived at Plymouth Rock in 1620 with barrels of
cider in tow, and Presidents John Adams (a pitcher of cider every
morning) and William Henry Harrison (in 1840 he ran on the slogan
``log cabin and hard cider'') ensured the beverage remained
popular.
</P>
<P>
   While most of their cider was consumed by drinking it, Patent is
convinced it was also used for sauces and marinades.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know for certain that the old New England method of making
an apple pie included a cider syrup, that called for boiling down
two cups or so of cider,'' Patent said. ``This gave the pie a rich,
carmelized flavor.
</P>
<P>
   ``By using boiled-down cider, the syrup that surrounds the
apples is thicker and sweeter and more succulent than flour. I like
the approach of using apple with apple.''
</P>
<P>
   Patent admits he is continuing to experiment with different ways
of cooking with cider even though he has completed his upcoming
cookbook (co-authored with his wife, Dorothy Hinshaw Patent). ``All
of these uses for cider was a revelation to me,'' he said. ``I feel
I've barely touched the surface for all the ways cider can be
used.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are the cider recipes Patent provided:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _____ &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEW AGE WALDORF SALAD
</P>
<P>
   (Serves 8)
</P>
<P>
   1 8-ounce carton plain low-fat yogurt
</P>
<P>
   2 cups apple cider
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon celery seeds
</P>
<P>
   5 cups chopped apple (such as Granny Smith, Rome and/or Gala)
</P>
<P>
   1 cup chopped peeled celeriac (celery root)
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup coarsely chopped pecans, toasted
</P>
<P>
   8 Boston lettuce leaves
</P>
<P>
   Spoon yogurt onto several layers of heavy-duty paper towels and
spread to one-half-inch thickness. Cover yogurt with additional
paper towels and let stand five minutes. Scrape into a bowl using a
rubber spatula; cover and chill.
</P>
<P>
   Bring cider to a boil in a medium, heavy saucepan over high
heat; cook until reduced to one-half cup (about 20 minutes). Cool
completely.
</P>
<P>
   Combine the chilled yogurt, cider and celery seeds in a large
bowl, stirring yogurt mixture well with a whisk. Add the chopped
apple, celeriac and toasted pecans, tossing gently to coat. Serve
salad on lettuce-lined plates.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _____ &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SAVOY CABBAGE COOKED IN HARD CIDER
</P>
<P>
   (Serves 4)
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   2 large yellow onions, cut in half vertically and sliced
one-quarter-inch thick
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons cider vinegar
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 pound savoy cabbage, cored and cut into one-half-inch thick
slices (about 8 cups prepared)
</P>
<P>
   1 large tart apple (eight ounces), quartered, cored, peeled, and
thinly sliced crosswise
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup hard cider
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup chicken stock or other poultry stock
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon fennel seed, crushed
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   Heat the olive oil in a large skillet or saute pan over medium
heat. When hot, add the onions, vinegar, and sugar. Stir well and
cook, covered, until the onions are softened, about 10 minutes. Add
the cabbage, apple, hard cider, chicken stock, fennel seed,
one-half teaspoon salt and one-quarter teaspoon pepper. Stir well
and cover the pan.
</P>
<P>
   Cook, stirring occasionally, until the cabbage is completely
tender, about 30 minutes. At the end of cooking, there should be
very little liquid left in the pan. If there is too much, cook
uncovered over high heat, stirring and tossing the cabbage mixture
to evaporate excess moisture and to concentrate the juices. Add
salt and pepper to taste and serve hot.
</P>
<P>
   Note: Savoy cabbage is milder and sweeter than regular green
cabbage, and it pairs exceedingly well with onions and apples.
Apples get used three ways here: sliced, as hard cider and cider
vinegar. It's important to use a tart apple, such as Granny Smith.
Serve this with pork roasts or with just about any stew or ragout.
Double the recipe if you have a large enough pan. Leftovers taste
even better the next day.

</P>
<P>
   CHICKEN SCALLOPINI WITH TOMATOES AND RAISINS
</P>
<P>
   (Serves 4)
</P>
<P>
   6 boneless and skinless chicken thighs
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   Flour, for dusting
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   2/3 cup hard cider
</P>
<P>
   2/3 cup chicken stock
</P>
<P>
   2 medium Roma tomatoes, peeled, seeded, juiced and diced
</P>
<P>
   1 medium tart apple (about 6 ounces), quartered, cored, peeled,
and diced
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup raisins
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons finely chopped flat-leaf parsley
</P>
<P>
   Pound the chicken thighs between sheets of wax paper to a
one-quarter-inch thickness. Cut each thigh into two pieces and coat
both sides lightly with salt and pepper. Dust with flour just
before cooking. Heat half the butter and half the oil in a large
heavy skillet over medium high heat. When hot, add half the chicken
pieces and saute on both sides until golden brown and cooked
through, four to five minutes total. Remove chicken and add
remaining butter and oil to the pan. Saute remaining chicken the
same way. When cooked, add to the first batch; cover and keep warm.
Pour the cooking fat out of the skillet. Replace the pan over
medium-high heat and add the hard cider. Cook, scraping up the
browned bits from the bottom of the pan, until the sauce is syrupy.
Add the chicken stock, tomatoes, and raisins. Cook, stirring, until
the sauce is slightly thickened, about two minutes. Taste and
adjust seasoning with salt and pepper. Add the chicken back to the
pan and baste with the sauce. Cook briefly just to reheat the
chicken. Sprinkle with the parsley and serve at once.
</P>
<P>
   Serve with buttered noodles.

VOLUNTEERS SEEK TO IMPROVE OLD CEMETERY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MIKE FRICANO  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TROY, N.Y. _ Volunteers are trying to spruce the nation's
third-oldest rural cemetery, where shrub-obscured resting places
reveal the aging cemetery's need for help.
</P>
<P>
   A newly formed group calling itself the Friends of Oakwood
Cemetery plan to help clean up and raise money for a volunteer
maintenance program.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really is museum of history and art. We'd love to bring the
whole thing back to national prominence,'' the group's president,
Terry Page, said of the nearly 150-year old cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   The 625-acre Oakwood Cemetery was built from 1848 to 1850. Its
nearly 29 miles of roads, 56,000 graves and 350 acres of lawn make
even cutting the grass a daunting task for the four full-time
employees and seven summer part-timers, said Craig Bryce,
vice-president of the cemetery's board of trustees.
</P>
<P>
   Among the group's plans are an adopt-a-plot program where
volunteers would go to the cemetery at least twice a year to remove
weeds and clean grave sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really pretty remarkable they're able to do what they
do,'' said an optimistic Bryce, who added the efforts should
relieve the demands on full-time staffers, who already dig the
graves besides care for the grounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it could be wonderful if we get enough people
interested,'' Bryce said, who hopes to schedule more cleanings
depending on how well this first one goes next week.
</P>
<P>
   Generating volunteer interest is important, Bryce said, because
the not-for-profit cemetery's annual budget is $312,000. This comes
from interments, the sale of plots, interest from the $1.2 million
endowment and fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   The Friends of Oakwood Cemetery hope to raise additional money
through fund-raising and grants, Bryce said.
</P>
<P>
   Renovating the Gardner Earl Crematorium/Chapel is a major
project currently on the agenda. Opened in 1890, it was the first
crematorium in New York State and one of the first in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Today, about 30 services are held each year in the castle-like
structure. And although the retorts (cremation furnaces) lay
dormant in a back room, every year there are about 400 cremations
in an adjacent building, Bryce said.
</P>
<P>
   From the hand-carved oak pews to the five stained-glass windows
in the main chamber, the Earls spent lavishly in designing the
crematorium, said Terry Page.
</P>
<P>
   The windows are believed to be from Tiffany but that cannot be
verified, because there are no records, Page said. Rumor has it
that the Earls asked contractors to destroy them, Page said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were embarrassed at how much they had spent,'' Page said.
</P>
<P>
   The Earl's directive of ``spend as much as you need'' has paid
off some 100 years later. The building's structural integrity is as
solid as the day it was built, Bryce said.
</P>
<P>
   However, not even Tiffany windows can endure years of exposure
to the elements. The cost to fix three of the five windows, is
$48,000, Bryce said. Because, the crematorium's endowment is only
$50,000, and the cemetery only spends the $4,500 annual interest on
upkeep, grants will be needed to fix the windows, Bryce said.
</P>
<P>
   Both Page and Bryce said they would like to see more services
and tours at the crematorium.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really a shame that people don't come in here. It's a
gorgeous building. It's a gorgeous cemetery,'' Bryce said.

EXPORT-DEPENDENT WASHINGTON IS VULNERABLE TO RECESSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BRUCE RAMSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Official economists are often among the last to
predict recessions. Thus it was notable Monday when Oregon's
economist, Paul Warner, said the chance of a U.S. recession ``is
definitely growing and is getting close to 50 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Just a month ago, our own state economist, Chang Mook Sohn, put
that chance at 35 percent. Sohn takes cheer in the Federal
Reserve's recent cut in interest rates and says the United States
may still be spared a downturn. But he adds, ``We recognize the
uncertainty.''
</P>
<P>
   Recession has been raging in Asia for a year, and has now spread
to Russia. And though it has mainly not spread here, every time one
looks at the crisis, it seems to get worse.
</P>
<P>
   This state is particularly vulnerable to infection because it is
dependent on trade. The Boeing Co., our largest exporter, has just
reported that it has 36 undelivered aircraft in storage, partly to
customers in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   We are also vulnerable in ways common with other states. If
stocks go down, fewer employees cash in options. Last year, Warner
said, Oregon residents reported $4 billion in capital-gains income,
double the amount of 1995. He expects a much lower figure this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Warner doesn't have a capital-gains figure for Washington
because we don't tax income. But the income, or lack of it, is just
as real.
</P>
<P>
   Warner takes comfort, however, in low interest rates. ``We have
no experience with a recession that is preceded by falling interest
rates,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Warner appeared on a panel in Seattle organized by The
Associated Press. The panel was disturbing in its contradictions.
Representatives of agriculture and forest products painted a
picture of gloom, while a representative of the software industry
was exuberantly bullish.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Wilcox, president of the Washington Software Alliance,
said her members rely more on exports to English-speaking countries
than to Asia. Her members are doing great. Employers here,
including non-software companies such as Boeing and Safeco, predict
that software jobs will increase by 46,000 workers in the next
three years, she said. Software salaries in this state, she said,
are the highest in the nation, and average $65,000.
</P>
<P>
   On the same dais was Jim Jesernig, director of the state's
Department of Agriculture, who said this year has been ``one of the
most difficult times farmers have faced in the state's history.''
</P>
<P>
   The apple harvest is coming in at 93 million to 94 million boxes
_ not the 110-million-box flood that growers feared, but a deluge
in any case. Asia, which had been absorbing 35 percent of
Washington's harvest, has cut back. Russia, which had been taking
lower-quality fruit, has imploded. And, Jesernig said, ``China has
glutted the world market in juice. It's almost not worth it to
juice apples anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The state's other big farm crop is soft white wheat. Of this, 87
percent has been shipped to Asia to be made into noodles. Asians
are not going to stop eating noodles. But Tom Mick, CEO of the
Washington Wheat Commission, said they have cut back on Washington
wheat. Government grain boards in Canada and elsewhere have
undercut U.S. dealers, and the U.S. government has shut off the
market in Pakistan by refusing to extend commercial credit. We
continue to embargo another good customer, Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Washington wheat farmers are being paid about $2.40 per bushel,
which Jesernig reckons to be about $1 below cost. Grain elevators
are full, and 32 million bushels are going to be stored on the
ground, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's forest products. Forest exports to Asia are ``in a
huge nose dive'' this year, said Rosemarie Braden, research analyst
with the Center for International Trade in Forest Products at the
University of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Logs, lumber and chips have made up most of the industry's
export revenue in the 1990s, but almost none of its growth. These
traditional exports plunged in 1997 and continue downward. The '90s
growth had come in the much smaller but promising value-added
products: prefab buildings, joinery, wooden windows, cabinets and
doors. These are luxury items in Asia, and sales have dropped
sharply. Braden said some companies have walked away from the
market, so that when good times return they will have to start all
over again.
</P>
<P>
   No one spoke from the fishing industry, and it was just as well.
And yet the central Puget Sound area continues to hum along at full
employment.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Seattle, we think of ourselves as sophisticated and
connected to the world. Actually, it is in places like Forks,
Dayton and Wenatchee where connection is more direct and obvious.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Four years ago, Artisoft Inc. was riding high. Since then, it
has shrunk from 700 employees to 150. In the last two years it has
tumbled from a $13.6 million annual profit to a combined loss of
more than $30 million.
</P>
<P>
   What happened? Windows 95.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft Corp.'s popular operating system and its successor,
Windows 98, have caused life-threatening crises at Artisoft and
many other software companies, simply because Microsoft keeps
adding features to Windows that computer users once had to buy
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The practice has drawn fire from the US Justice Department. For
instance, Microsoft's addition to Windows of free software to
browse the Internet helped spark the current federal antitrust
lawsuit against the software giant.
</P>
<P>
   But Microsoft's upgrade strategy is nothing new. Since the early
1980s, the company has frequently added featuresat no extra charge
_disk repair utilities, networking support, and Internet
compatibility, to name a few. Tod Nielsen, general manager of
software-developer relations at Microsoft, insists that the
Redmond, Wash., company adds features to improve the product, not
to hurt smaller competitors.
</P>
<P>
   But Microsoft's slightest move can cause serious hardship for
small companies that suddenly see their markets disappear.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies react with fury, demanding that the federal
government set limits on Microsoft's ability to add free upgrades
to its software.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely unfair,'' said Zvi Alon, president of
NetManage Inc., a California maker of networking software that has
lost key markets to Microsoft. Alon believes that Microsoft should
be compelled to charge for significant additions to its products.
</P>
<P>
   He insists that there won't be much of a software industry left
if Microsoft has carte blanche to add features to its operating
systems. ``If we use that logic and keep it moving forward,'' said
Alon, ``essentially we might as well all go home and stop
working.''
</P>
<P>
   Other software companies, such as Symantec Corp. and Quarterdeck
Corp., are finding ways to survive and even prosper by cooperating
with Microsoft. And still others dramatically shift their focus,
aiming to find new success in a market segment that Microsoft
hasn't conquered _ at least not yet.
</P>
<P>
   Artisoft, at one time based in Tucson, Ariz. but now in
Cambridge, Mass., is one company that's being forced to adapt or
die.
</P>
<P>
   Artisoft had once carved out a small but profitable niche. By
the mid-1980s, businesses had discovered the power of computer
networking, connecting desktop machines to share files or use the
same printer. But it was hard to link computers that ran
Microsoft's then-popular MS-DOS operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Artisoft responded with LANtastic, software that made it easy
for small businesses to tie their PCs into networks. In fiscal
1994, Artisoft raked in revenues of more than $107 million and
profits of $13.6 million, primarily on the strength of -LANtastic.
It was the last good year the company had.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Microsoft rolled out its replacement for MS-DOS _
Windows 95, which had networking software built in.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Thomas, Artisoft's chief operating officer and president,
realized that the firm was in big trouble. ``You're competing
against a company that not only has a huge marketing operation, but
also is installing its product on every PC made,'' said Thomas.
``In late '95, early '96, it was clear this was going to have a
huge impact on the revenues.''
</P>
<P>
   It was time to find a new business model. Artisoft decided to
plunge into the market for software that controls the operation of
complex business telephone systems. The market for
-computer-telephone integration is supposed to grow to $6 billion a
year by 2000, according to market research firm Dataquest.
</P>
<P>
   Artisoft moved to Massachusetts in September to take advantage
ofa high concentration of expertise in its newfield. Says Thomas:
``I don't think you can find a better place than the Boston area
for computer telephony.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, another local firm has decided to seek relief through
merger. Last month, FTP Software Inc. of Andover, Mass. was
acquired by Alon's NetManage Inc. Both have struggled to reorient
their businesses after key products were rendered irrelevant by
Windows 95.
</P>
<P>
   NetManage invented WinSock, a program that enabled users of PCs
to communicate over the Internet. In the early 1990s, when
consumers and businesses began going on line, NetManage scored
considerable success with its Chameleon Internet software, which
includeda primitive Web browser and WinSock.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a substantial market share, 60 plus percent,'' said
NetManage president Alon.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the country, FTP was also prospering from
the sale of Internet software for PCs, as well as its OnNet
corporate networking software based on TCP/IP, the Internet data
protocol.
</P>
<P>
   But both companies were unprepared for the arrival of Windows
95. Microsoft had included its own software, similar to WinSock,
and the first crude but usable version of Microsoft's Internet
browser. Suddenly, NetManage Chameleon didn't have a market any
more.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's operating systems weren't NetManage's only source of
trouble. Another successful NetManage product was Ecco Pro,a
popular personal information manager, a program used by individuals
to plan their activities. But Microsoft began including a competing
product, Outlook, with its Microsoft Office software suite. Office
is by far the most popular business software package, and Alon
decided that few Office users would pay an additional $139 for Ecco
Pro. Last December, NetManage discontinued the product.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, on the East Coast, FTP was also struggling. Why
should businesses buy OnNet to create internal TCP/IP networks?
Windows 95 had similar features built right in. Soon FTP saw its
sales wither. The firm posted a 1997 net loss of $56.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were competing with a free offering bundled with operating
systems'' sold by Microsoft, FTP general counsel Douglas Flood told
Bloomberg News last year. ``That clearly had some impact.''
</P>
<P>
   It all looked familiar to Alon at NetManage. ``FTP was in
exactly the same boat,'' he said. Their common hardship made an
acquisition seem appealing.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies also shared a strong background in creating
software for linking PCs to diverse computer systems. By focusing
the new NetManage on these markets, Alon hopes to stay clear of
future operating systemchanges from Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Makers of utility software are especially vulnerable to
death-by-Microsoft-upgrade. Utilities perform unglamorous but
important functions, such as fixing minor disk-drive problems,
restoring accidentally deleted files, or hunting for computer
viruses.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterdeck Corp. of Marina del Rey, Calif., came to prominence
selling QEMM, which makes more efficient use of memory on
Microsoft-based PCs. But Windows 95 featured vastly improved memory
management that made products like QEMM far less useful.
Quarterdeck's revenues fell from $117.6 milllion in 1995 to $83.8
million last year, and 1995's $11.25 million profit became a 1997
loss of more than $18 million.
</P>
<P>
   Suzanne Dickson, Quarterdeck's vice president of marketing, said
her firm is rolling out utility products to solve problems that
Microsoft still hasn't addressed. For instance, it's notoriously
difficult to remove unwanted software from a Windows machine.
Quarterdeck is one of several companies touting uninstaller
software to make the job easier. The firm has also entered the
antivirus market and has a new disk-cloning product to help people
add bigger hard drives to their machines.
</P>
<P>
   Far from being angry with Microsoft, Dickson said, Quarterdeck
sees Microsoft as an ally. Microsoft engineers consult with
Quarterdeck's people, keeping them informed of changes in Windows
that might affect sales of a Quarterdeck product. Quarterdeck uses
this guidance to design new utilities that meet needs that
Microsoft has overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a symbiotic type of relationship,'' said Dickson. ``We
wouldn't even have a utilities business if it weren'tfor the
operating system.''
</P>
<P>
   A similar relationship exists between Microsoft and Symantec
Corp., maker of the popular Norton Utilities. Each new version of
Windows has added features like disk repair that were once a prime
reason to buy Norton Utilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're the quintessential example of a company that
ought to hate Microsoft.'' said Symantec president Gordon Eubanks.
Instead, Eubanks is a close Microsoft ally and has helped to form
the Association for Competitive Technology, a -software-industry
group that supports Microsoft in its antitrust battles.
</P>
<P>
   Partly it's because many of the improved utilities found in
Microsoft products, such as disk--repair software, were actually
created by Symantec and licensed to Microsoft. But aside from that,
Eubanks said that Microsoft works closely with Symantec to ensure
coexistence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it shocks people,'' said Eubanks. ``They're not a bunch
of raving maniacs who want to put everybody out of business.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems to be working. Symantec is the hottest company in PC
utilities, with fiscal 1998 sales of $578 million and profits of
$85 million.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's Tod Nielsen says his firm runs aggressive programs
to inform software developers about Microsoft's upgrade plans.
``Any developer that's impacted, he's going to know way before it's
shipping,'' Nielsen said.
</P>
<P>
   He conceded that some companies have been squashed by Microsoft
upgrades, but he argued that these are mainly firms that weren't
prepared to compete in one of the world's toughest industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are companies that say, `It's not fair; we have a
birthright,''' said Nielsen. ``Those are the companies that get
impacted negatively.''

PORTABLE PERFECTION COMES A LITTLE CLOSER
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN  
c.1998 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since starting this column in 1993, I've been on a seemingly
impossible quest to find the perfect notebook computer _ one that I
would buy with my own money. I've tried a lot of very good _ and
very bad _ portable PCs over the past five years, but I've never
found one I could call my own.
</P>
<P>
   Some systems have come close, but there's always been some
deal-killer _ a poor keyboard layout, a klutzy pointing device,
poor battery life, poky performance, too much weight or too much
expense.
</P>
<P>
   The latest generation of portable computers that use the Windows
operating system have been particularly frustrating. They include
the mobile version of Intel's Pentium II processor, which gulps
battery power and runs very hot.
</P>
<P>
   However, I've found a remarkable high-end notebook that seems to
have gotten around these problems. It comes the closest, so far, to
my idea of the perfect portable.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Tecra 8000 _ $3,799, Toshiba America.
</P>
<P>
   That I would be so enamored of the Tecra 8000 takes me somewhat
by surprise. I've not been that fond of Toshiba's portables in the
past, even though they are the best-selling notebooks. They always
struck me as generic in design and performance.
</P>
<P>
   But not this one. The Tecra 8000 has a new, sleek, gunmetal-gray
case that's thinner _ though with a slightly larger footprint _
than its predecessors. Its keyboard is excellent, its
TrackPoint-style pointing device is comfortable to use and, for a
Pentium II system, its battery life is very good.
</P>
<P>
   The model I tried came with a 300-megahertz Pentium II chip, 64
megabytes of memory, a 6.4-gigabyte hard drive, a 24X CD-ROM drive,
a 56K voice/fax modem and a 13.3-inch active matrix screen that can
support resolutions up to 1,024-by-768 pixels. It also has a TV-out
connector, so you can connect the computer to a standard television
set.
</P>
<P>
   Models are also available with slower processors and both larger
(14.1-inch) and smaller (12.1-inch) displays.
</P>
<P>
   It weighs just a little over 6 pounds, which is astounding for a
high-end system. That's partly due to the fact that this computer
has room for only one disk drive at a time _ CD, DVD or floppy disk
_ in a swappable bay. You can also connect the floppy externally.
</P>
<P>
   I easily averaged three hours of battery life, and with an
additional battery in the drive bay, I could have doubled that.
That's much better than most Pentium II systems I've tried, which
seem to max out at about 2 { hours.
</P>
<P>
   It's as solid a notebook as I've tried. Lately, I've found some
notebooks to be unusually finicky _ troubled with small glitches
or, in some cases, refusing to run programs _ but this one took
everything I threw at it.
</P>
<P>
   And it ran them exceedingly well. Normally, notebook computers
just don't have the speed of their desktop brethren, but this model
was beyond frisky. Memory-hog software such as WordPerfect 8 opened
almost instantly. It even handled graphics-intensive 3-D games
running at high resolutions with ease.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, the Tecra 8000 isn't perfect. I wish Toshiba had figured
out a way to keep both the CD and the floppy built-in. And the
power management seems a bit incomplete. For example, there's no
way to manually adjust the screen's brightness. You get three
auto-settings _ dim, bright, super-bright _ and that's it.
</P>
<P>
   And it's a bit expensive. I'd like to see this configuration of
the Tecra 8000 selling closer to the $3,000 mark.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Armada 1700 _ $2,499, Compaq Computer Corp.
</P>
<P>
   If the Tecra is a bit out of your price range, and you must have
an all-in-one machine, Compaq's Armada 1700 is an excellent choice.
While it's a bit heavy, and its battery life is nothing to write
home about, the 1700 is a solid workhorse of a portable.
</P>
<P>
   The 1700 I tried had a 233-megahertz Pentium II processor, 32
megabytes of memory, a four-gigabyte hard drive, a 56K fax modem, a
12.1-inch active matrix screen with resolutions up to 800-by-600
and a 24X CD-ROM drive. It includes a built-in floppy drive,
excellent stereo speakers and a rugged, black case. It feels like
this puppy can take some abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq still makes my favorite portable keyboards, with the best
layout in the industry. The flat touchpad is nice, with just the
right amount of sensitivity. And the screen is nice and bright, an
improvement over the last Armada I tried.
</P>
<P>
   Its performance was very good for a 233-megahertz system,
opening applications in a snap. It bogged down running some 3-D
games at high resolutions; reducing the display size helped
dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the 1700 is a very heavy portable. In this
configuration, it weighs in at just under eight pounds. With the
larger 14.1-inch screen, it can approach 8.5 pounds. It will not be
popular with those who dash through airports for a living. However,
part of that weight comes from the fact that the power supply is
built in, so you have to take into account that you are also not
lugging ``the brick'' around.
</P>
<P>
   Battery life is what you'd expect from a Pentium II system _ the
best I could do was about two hours. Using the modem or the CD-ROM
quickly cuts that to 60-90 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The 1700 is Compaq's new value line, replacing the 1500 with an
all-Pentium II lineup. If you need the power of a Pentium II, but
don't have lots of cash and are willing to put up with the weight,
it's a bargain.

OPERATOR? GIVE ME THE WEB AND PLEASE MAKE IT SNAPPY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A group of communications, software and financial services
companies plans to announce an alliance Tuesday aimed at creating
standards for speech recognition that will push electronic commerce
and the Internet beyond the boundaries of the personal computer,
potentially making it accessible to anyone with a telephone.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement, to be made at an industry trade show in New
York, is intended to expand the ability to perform Internet
transactions or retrieve data from the World Wide Web by using
speech-recognition technology to translate spoken words into data
commands transmitted via the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The companies, which include Motorola Inc., SAP AG, Visa
International, Broadvision Inc., and Nuance Communications, a unit
of SRI International, describe their effort as V-Commerce and argue
that telephone access will break down the last barrier remaining
between the mass of consumers and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Currently access to the Internet is limited to those with
personal computers and Internet capability, but increasingly
executives in both the computer and communications industries
envision a new Internet platform that will be controlled by voice
and will display information on a small portable screen.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year speech recognition technologies have improved
significantly, making it possible for a number of companies to
begin deploying systems that answer questions for phone call and
package routing, stock trading, banking, airline reservations and
other commercial transactions. Now the companies are making an
effort to integrate voice systems with Internet and corporate data
bases.
</P>
<P>
   The new drive toward integration will make it possible for
consumers to pose questions by telephone and then receive data in a
variety of different ways, including by phone, portable devices
such as pagers and cell phones, or in the Web browser of their
personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see voice recognition making tremendous advances,'' said
Todd Chaffee, executive vice president for corporate development
and alliances at Visa. ``Voice technology is going to lead to a
massive extension of electronic commerce beyond those with PC's.''
</P>
<P>
   In the future, according to the alliance executives, it will be
increasingly simple to use a telephone to make a query such as
``tell me the flights from San Francisco to New York leaving
tomorrow.'' The answer to that question could then be immediately
spoken by phone, or displayed on a pager or in a computer Web
browser.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, gaining access to the same information via a Web
browser alone can require as many as 15 mouse clicks and take up to
three minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Nuance is one of a small group of companies, including Applied
Language Technologies, Lernout &AMP; Hauspie Speech Products NV, Dragon
Systems and the IBM Corp., that are now developing basic speech
recognition technologies that are speaker-independent and do not
require training.
</P>
<P>
   This is a significant advance and is permitting wider deployment
of voice applications, such as recent Nuance systems that permit
call routing at Sears, Roebuck or stock information at Schwab.
</P>
<P>
   Both Visa, the credit card processor, and Motorola are investors
in Nuance and both companies are moving to deploy both new services
and products that are based on the new voice technologies.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Visa executives said the company had created prototypes of five
voice-based financial services including credit card activation,
lost and stolen card replacement, travel planning, voice banking
and bill payment.
</P>
<P>
   The services will be available commercially next year. Motorola
executives said the communications company was working to create
new Internet standards that would make speech extensions to
standard Internet services simple to implement.
</P>
<P>
   The company recently introduced a new voice Internet standard
called Voice Markup Language, or VoxML, to allow software
developers to add speech to their Web applications. Because VoxML
applications can be deployed on standard Web servers, the company
maintains it is straightforward to add the technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Motorola looks at this area as a fundamental element of our
strategy,'' said Maria Martinez, vice president and general manager
of Motorola's Internet division.
</P>
<P>
   One of the strengths of the VoxML standard is that it would
permit responses to voice queries to be displayed on a variety of
existing Web devices, from pagers to browsers.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, electronic commerce has been constrained by the PC,''
said Ron Croen, Nuance's chief executive officer. ``We're intent on
making the audience larger by an order of magnitude.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Alan Meier would like people to mean ``off'' when they say
``off.''
</P>
<P>
   Meier, a scientist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory
in California, estimates that U.S. consumers spend $3.5 billion a
year powering electronic devices and household appliances that they
think are turned off, when actually those appliances are in a
suspended state called stand-by mode.
</P>
<P>
   TVs and VCRs are among the biggest culprits, as are high-end PCs
chock-full of power-sucking chips and gadgetry. While a TV, for
example, might use 50 watts of power when it is on, it may still
use as much as 10 watts when it is off. This stand-by feature makes
possible the much-revered remote control, among other things.
</P>
<P>
   Battery chargers, like those used for cellular phones, continue
to use energy even when there is no phone plugged in. Even
microwaves consume energy when they are not in use, mostly to power
the electronic keypad. And Intel's Pentium chip, the brains inside
most PCs sold today, is a huge stand-by energy hog, Meier says.
</P>
<P>
   Though the wasted electricity amounts to only a few cents per
appliance, the total being wasted is enormous: equivalent to the
amount produced by eight power plants. That comes to about $50 a
household per year, Meier says.
</P>
<P>
   The solution? Meier says it is unreasonable to expect consumers
to unplug, particularly when they have come to appreciate the
conveniences made possible with stand-by mode, as in remote-control
garage-door openers.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, the responsibility lies with manufacturers, who are
simply not paying much attention to energy use. Using an
energy-saving power supply adds nothing to the cost of producing a
device, according to the makers of energy-efficient power
technology, like Power Integrations of Sunnyvale, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Meier says he and his colleagues hope to avoid promoting
government regulation to deal with this problem, by getting
manufacturers to agree voluntarily to build products that use only
1 watt in stand-by mode.
</P>
<P>
   The other side of the problem, he says, comes from misuse of the
word ``off,'' which in electronics has come to mean neither off nor
on. Someday, if Meier's efforts pay off, the ``off'' button will,
once again, actually mean ``off.''

   Archives Win a Reprieve in Storing Electronic Records
</P>
<P>
   As technology marches forward, so do the paper handlers in the
United States' capital.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a U.S. District Court judge sided with the National
Archives and Records Administration in an 11th-hour plea for more
time _ more time, that is, to figure out how to deal with the
voluminous e-mail and other electronic records produced daily by
federal agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The government now has no system for storing electronic records
except to print them out and file them. In the process, a vast
majority simply get deleted.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two years ago, a group that included researchers,
librarians and Ralph Nader's group Public Citizen sued the
Archives, contending that allowing the deletion of electronic
records leads to the loss of valuable public information.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs contend that paper records are not as useful to
the public as electronic ones, which can be easily searched. (The
nation got its first taste of the increasing importance of
electronic records during the Iran-contra trials, when some of the
most important evidence against Oliver North came from e-mail
records.)
</P>
<P>
   Last year the judge agreed with the plaintiffs in the lawsuit
and ordered the National Archives to devise guidelines for the
storage of electronic records by Sept. 30, 1998. But when that
deadline passed, the Archives were given extra time to come up with
a master plan.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, it is business as usual in Washington, as
agencies continue to push the delete button.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated plaintiffs accused the Archives of stalling,
primarily to cover up the fact that they have not made any
progress. The archivist of the United States, John Carlin, says the
problem is simply too complex to rush a solution.
</P>
<P>
   But Eddie Becker, a Washington researcher who is a plaintiff in
the suit, said: ``They're more concerned with how to get rid of
stuff, not preserve it. They want to preserve only the material the
agencies want to keep.''

   Meditation in a Wired World: Stare at the Screen and Relax
</P>
<P>
   It is easy for Mark Abouzeid to preach inner harmony and balance
for today's highly stressed business people. He lives in a house in
Castelmuzio, Italy, population 250, where the view from his window
_ a hundred olive trees and the church featured in the movie ``The
English Patient'' _ is a picture of tranquillity.
</P>
<P>
   But with the help of two high-speed phone lines and nine
employees scattered in Europe and the United States, Abouzeid, a
transplanted American, keeps in touch with angst, '90s style.
</P>
<P>
   His business, Voice of Wellness, creates sites on the World Wide
Web intended to help the average, non-Tuscan-dwelling individual
learn to stay centered.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't make much sense sitting in an office, stressed out,
trying to convey those principles,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the summer, the site began offering a guided meditation
exercise, which was culled from a CD-ROM project that never quite
got off the ground. So far, 12,000 people have come to
Aboutliving.com to download the free audio, at least half of them
doing so from work, Abouzeid said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided to give away the software and see if anyone would
use it,'' he said, explaining that meditation has a bad image and
therefore needs free promotion. ``People think they have to shave
their heads and become gurus just to take a few minutes to relax.''
</P>
<P>
   Chilling out, Web-style, involves staring at images on the
screen while a calming voice leads a user into meditation. ``The
primary focus is becoming aware of everything around you, more
mindful of how you act and react,'' said Abouzeid, who worked in
mergers and acquisitions as an investment banker in Asia in the
1980s. ``I've got a lot of karma to work off.''
</P>
<P>
   Abouzeid recognizes that he also has a lot of work to do. Making
a viable Web business with a wellness magazine that plans to
survive off advertising sales and electronic commerce is a
challenge to anyone's inner peace.

PATENTS: SOFTWARE THAT TRACKS WEB USAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By SABRA CHARTRAND   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of all the unknowns about the Internet, the greatest questions
may revolve around whether or not it will ever become a reliable
money maker. Granted, some companies do earn money through World
Wide Web sites, but for the majority the promise of e-commerce with
vast new markets, customers and profits remains unfulfilled.
</P>
<P>
   That does not daunt those who believe that with customized
information delivery and targeted advertising, someday the Internet
will become the most lucrative way to sell goods and services. They
picture a world in which customers will leave traces of information
about their habits, preferences, spending patterns, economic needs
and personal status every time they use a computer. The information
will be sorted into databases and used to fashion Web sites,
promotional campaigns, advertisements and even junk mail that is
tailored specifically to each user.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly such visions raise concerns about privacy. Without
tackling those issues, however, many companies are at work on the
software and hardware needed to make culling the information and
setting up the databases a reality. One company, Thinking Media
Corp. of New York, has a new patent for a method of tracking how
people respond to Internet advertisements and commercial Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   The company says that its approach is singular because rather
than count the number of ads or Web-site pages sent out by Internet
server computers, it counts the sites or ads actually received by
the browser software on individual computers.
</P>
<P>
   Many Web sites earn money by selling advertising space. They
carry banner ads in the manner of city buses adorned with placards
for jeans, new movies and fast-food restaurants. Surely people see
those ads as the bus passes, but do they pay attention to them? Do
they buy the jeans? By the same token, advertisers wonder whether
an ad on a Web site catches anyone's eye. How many people actually
follow it up?
</P>
<P>
   There are a variety of ways for advertisers to track how many
``hits,'' or clicks of a mouse, a particular ad icon or Web site
receives. Data can be collected from central servers, or from the
individual sites that display the ads.
</P>
<P>
   But Owen Davis, the managing director and a founder of Thinking
Media, says the vagaries of how Internet servers provide access to
computer users mean those methods undercount how many ads actually
reach people as they sit at their terminals.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the Internet was created as a series of
independent computer networks that would not be subject to total
failure if one or more sections went down. But that makes it
difficult to track the movement of information between browsers and
servers that act independently and do not communicate.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've done is insert a very small homing beacon that goes
along with an ad or a Web page,'' Davis explained. ``It's a piece
of Java, a Java applet.''
</P>
<P>
   Vid Jain, the company's chief creative officer, explained, ``The
patent covers the idea of embedding a little smart piece of
software with something sent out, whether it's a Web page, an ad or
other resource, so when it gets to your machine it gets `live,' and
sends back information.'' Part of that information, Davis said, is
``how much time the client spent on the Web site; once the Web site
is loaded, it starts a timer and it runs.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, when someone uses a browser to call up a Web site, the
software enables Davis' company to follow that page as it leaves
the server and heads for its destination.
</P>
<P>
   The patent also eliminates a problem created by the process
known as caching. That refers to the time-saving mechanism under
which a person loads a page from a server one time. After that, the
page is stored on his or her PC hard drive, creating a temporary
backlog of recent documents. This cache means the server does not
continually have to send items the user has recently requested.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of keeping track and counting on the server side, if
you look at a page twice or more but the server has only sent it
once, then there's no way to keep track,'' Davis pointed out. With
his company's software, ``every time the page comes up and a person
looks at it, it sends back a message that it's live, that the page
is live.''
</P>
<P>
   Thinking Media's software uses so-called cookie files that
identify individual computers and Internet protocols, or Web site
addresses, ``as a way to mark someone,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know the person, but we know their machine,'' he
added. ``We can look at the time they spend, the cached ads, we can
look at the cookie and the IP, and we can collect environmental
variables like the browser type and the kind of operating system
they're on.
</P>
<P>
   ``The value of the cookie and IP identifiers as we build a
profile is that we can know that someone has seen an ad twice, so
we can take them off the list and swap the ad for another one,''
Davis explained. ``Now we have real control over the reach and
frequency, and over ads and Web pages.''
</P>
<P>
   The patented software tracks how people use commercial Web sites
as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``As someone moves through an ad and makes use of different
`decision trees,' it allows us to keep track of that as well,'' he
said. ``Say Barnes &AMP; Noble has live chats with famous authors
online. As part of their promotional feature, they put up six book
covers. You click on one, see a page of the book, and say `enroll
me in that,' and 24 hours before the event Barnes &AMP; Noble sends an
e-mail that says `Don't forget.'
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's also interesting to Barnes &AMP; Noble to know that you
looked at three other books but didn't enroll in the chats,'' he
continued. ``Imagine that you are Coca-Cola and you put a game
inside an ad. There's nothing to sign up for, but somebody might
play the game for three minutes. That's incredibly important
information because they had your undivided attention for three
minutes and they need to know that.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``Where an ad has some depth and requires people to
move through it, we can capture the time spent'' as well as other
statistics about use.
</P>
<P>
   Thinking Media's software is already in use at companies like
the Conde Nast unit of Advance Publications, American Express,
Procter &AMP; Gamble and IBM, Davis said. He and Jain received patent
5,769,952.
</P>
<P>
   Patents are available by number for $3 from the Patent and
Trademark Office, Washington, D.C. 20231.

SEC GUIDELINES TO YIELD DATA ON YEAR 2000 RISKS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By BARNABY J. FEDER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As awareness of the Year 2000 problem has spread, a wide gulf
has opened between computer consultants, who say many companies are
dangerously vulnerable, and Wall Street analysts, most of whom have
been telling investors there is little to worry about.
</P>
<P>
   Now, thanks to new guidelines from the Securities and Exchange
Commission, this debate is about to get something that has been in
short supply: public information about how most companies are doing
in assessing and reducing their risks.
</P>
<P>
   The new data will appear in reports filed with the SEC in the
coming weeks summing up corporate earnings for the quarter that
ended Wednesday. In response to previous prodding from the agency,
a majority of the 10,000 or so publicly traded companies that file
quarterly and annual earnings reports started mentioning Year 2000
concerns in filings earlier this year. The new reports, though,
will be the first for most of them since the agency, alarmed at how
vague and limited most disclosures had been, issued more specific
Year 2000 guidelines two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC guidelines have been viewed positively in Congress,
which on Thursday sent President Clinton a bill allowing companies
to exchange information on their Year 2000 readiness or put such
information on the World Wide Web without fear that the information
could be used against them in a lawsuit if it turned out to be
wrong. The protection does not cover knowingly false or reckless
statements.
</P>
<P>
   The Year 2000 problem, also known as the Millennium Bug, stems
from the longstanding practice of using just two numbers in
computer code to stand for the year, as in ``98'' for 1998.
Computers, software and electronic devices may read ``00'' as 1900
instead of 2000 and crash or create inaccurate data.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC wants companies to discuss specifically how much they
expect to spend to cope with this problem, assess how far along
they are in identifying and dealing with their problems and
describe what, if any, contingency plans they are making. It is
also requiring reasonable ``worst-case scenarios.''
</P>
<P>
   The agency also recommended that all companies consider a
variety of disclosures that might not be required, like the
percentage of their information-technology budget being used on
Year 2000 projects, whether other information-technology
investments were being delayed and what outside resources were
being used to verify that repairs were successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because the lack of information regarding your preparations
for the Year 2000 could seriously undermine the confidence
investors place in your company, it is imperative that you provide
thorough, meaningful disclosure on this topic,'' said SEC Chairman
Arthur Levitt in a letter to more than 9,000 chief executives.
</P>
<P>
   Investors have been given a hint of what the new disclosures may
look like from companies that filed reports covering the three
months that ended June 30. The SEC requested that they voluntarily
observe the new guidelines and many made at least a partial stab at
it.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Year 2000 consultants say the model to date is probably the
Phillips Petroleum report for the quarter that ended June 30, which
was filed in mid-August.
</P>
<P>
   The Year 2000 disclosure by Phillips ran more than 1,250 words,
over five times the length of the previous quarter. It noted that
although the overall Year 2000 project was ``on schedule,'' a piece
of it _ the introduction of new software from the Oracle Corp. that
would retire a number of defective programs _ was running far
enough behind schedule that the company had developed contingency
plans. Phillips said it planned to decide by the end of the third
quarter whether or not to rely fully on Oracle. (The company
decided on Thursday that the contingency plan would not be needed,
according to Del Clark, director of Year 2000 issues for Phillips.)
</P>
<P>
   Phillips also disclosed that it had spent $20 million of its
projected $58 million budget and that most of the rest _ $21
million _ would go to fix or replace chips in machinery and other
``embedded systems.''
</P>
<P>
   Mallinckrodt, a St. Louis-based medical equipment and supplies
company, was less detailed and more confident in its 10-K report
for the fiscal year that ended June 30, which was filed last week.
``Based on accomplishments to date, no contingency plans are
expected to be needed and therefore none have been developed,''
Mallinckrodt said.
</P>
<P>
   The same report might make some investors wonder whether
Mallinckrodt is too complacent, because it disclosed that the
company was still assessing what it might have to fix or replace in
its research, manufacturing, and facility management operations _
areas where embedded systems are common.
</P>
<P>
   The new data should give a snapshot of corporate America's Year
2000 readiness and may force some companies to look at the problems
more closely.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect investors to begin voting with their feet by March,''
said Jeff Jinnett, a New York lawyer. ``It could be a minefield for
companies that don't pay a lot of attention to what they are
disclosing.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Year 2000 consultants doubt, though, that enough reliable
information will emerge from the new filings to allow investors to
make worthwhile judgments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guidelines are window dressing unless we have random
audits in order to determine whether companies are disclosing
accurately,'' said Louis Marcoccio, Year 2000 director at the
Gartner Group in Stamford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Marcoccio said Gartner's research suggested that nearly nine out
of 10 companies were publicly underestimating their Year 2000
problems, either knowingly or inadvertently.

CONTROL OF DOMAIN NAMES ON INTERNET DRAWS ALTERNATIVE PROPOSAL
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By JERI CLAUSING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration this week enters the
final phase of what has been a highly contentious effort to hand
administration of the Internet over to an international nonprofit
corporation.
</P>
<P>
   A group led by Jon Postel, a founder of the Internet, presented
the government on Friday with its proposal for creating a
California-based entity called the Internet Corporation for
Assigned Names and Numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This organization will be unique in the world _ a
nongovernmental organization with significant responsibilities for
administering what is becoming an important global resource,''
Postel wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The larger significance of the proposal is that it lays out the
final privatization of the Internet by the federal government,
which financed decades of Internet development as a communication
tool for military and academic researchers.
</P>
<P>
   The more immediate issue is forming an equitable plan for
creating and distributing ``top-level domain names,'' the
identifiers like .com and .org that identify what type of resource
an Internet address is. The .com top-level domain, for example,
signifies a commercial address.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, domain names have been administered by the U.S.
government _ at first directly and in more recent years under a
government contract granting a registration monopoly to Network
Solutions, a corporation based in Herndon, Va. A number of private
companies have demanded that they be allowed to compete with
Network Solutions in the lucrative business of registering domain
names, while Europeans and Asian have complained that their
interests are underrepresented in the development and
administration of domain names.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, which
is newly incorporated, nominated nine interim board members to help
finish writing bylaws and create a permanent 19-member board
responsible for introducing competition and a recognition of
international interests to the domain registration system. Under
the proposal, the corporation would also make decisions on how and
when to add new top-level domains.
</P>
<P>
   But the long-awaited revamping plan by Postel's group still has
a number of critics, and the Clinton administration has not yet
ironed out the details for a smooth transition of crucial property
and customer records from Network Solutions to the new corporation.
</P>
<P>
   Ira Magaziner, the adviser to President Clinton who has been
overseeing the transition to private governance of the Internet,
had hoped to have a plan in place by the time the government's
contract with Network Solutions expired on Oct. 1. But a
last-minute breakdown in negotiations prompted the Commerce
Department to extend the old contract for one week. It is now set
to expire on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Another extension is likely, since the government will take 10
days of public comments on the plan and two proposed variations
before it moves forward. Many critics say the Postel plan was
hammered out behind closed doors, despite the administration's call
for a process that strove for consensus among the international
groups that have an interest in how the network is governed.
</P>
<P>
   One contention about the Postel plan concerns whether the new
agreement would unfairly strip Network Solutions of the lucrative
business it has built as the monopoly registrar of top-level
domains. Company spokesmen declined comment beyond saying
negotiations with the government were continuing.
</P>
<P>
   A larger issue about the plan, though, is whether there would be
proper fiscal controls and long-term checks on the powers of the
proposed new board, whose members would be largely appointed by the
professional, advocacy and commercial organizations that finance
the corporation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The substantive problem with it is that it is completely
obtuse to questions of separation of powers and limits and
accountability,'' said Lawrence Lessig, a Harvard Law School
professor who has been critical of what he sees as a secretive
process for drafting the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a perfect corporation if you trusted the board members,''
Lessig said, ``just like any Communist government is perfect if you
trust the Communist government.''
</P>
<P>
   An international coalition of associations representing a range
of Internet interests has filed its own bylaw proposals, which
would make the corporation based on membership rather than one
whose board members are largely selected by the organizations that
finance it.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In another objection, J. William Semich, president and chief
financial officer of .NU Domain, a registrar of second-level domain
names, said that the proposed bylaws lacked the proper budget
reviews and spending limits.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter to Secretary of Commerce William Daley, Postel
acknowledged the continuing opposition to his plan. He said that
while the organization had been formally incorporated, it had not
yet elected a board or adopted bylaws and did not plan to do so
until the completion of a Commerce Department review of the
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many challenges left for the days and years to come,
but the consensus that developed around these documents provides
considerable promise that those challenges can also be overcome,''
he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed interim board includes representatives of
telecommunications, Internet and academic interests from the United
States, Japan, Australia and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed interim board members are:
</P>
<P>
   _ Geraldine Capdeboscq, executive vice president for strategy,
technology and partnerships at Groupe Bull, an international
information systems group based in France.
</P>
<P>

governor of the nation's third largest state, says he will decide
next year whether he will seek the Republican nomination for the
presidency in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, son of the former president, is seen as a leading force in
the Republican Party and a candidate with broad appeal among
moderates and minorities. Polls indicate he has a resounding lead
over Garry Mauro, his Democratic opponent in next month's
gubernatorial race.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with reporters and editors of the San Antonio
Express-News on Tuesday, Bush said he did not think a potential
White House run would hurt his effectiveness as governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I wasn't interested in running for president, I would've
said so. And I told the truth nearly a year ago when I said I don't
know whether I will or will not run for the presidency, and people
are going to have to factor that in when they get to the voting
booth,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, 52, said he learned at the side of his father the kind of
toll the intense spotlight of a presidential campaign can take on a
president's family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what it's like to be the son of a president, since I've
been one. I've just got to weigh it out in my mind whether or not I
want to put my girls and my wife, who I adore and who is a great
first lady for Texas, into ... a different life.''
</P>
<P>
   Contradicting several recent news reports, Bush said he was not
afraid of the inevitable media scrutiny that would focus on him if
he became a candidate in the national arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``My life's been scrutinized. It was scrutinized in 1992 to the
point of a six-column story in the Wall Street Journal and I wasn't
even a candidate. It's been scrutinized in 1994'' during his first
campaign for governor, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can assure you my life was scrutinized during my entire time
as governor and I'm really being scrutinized now because of all
these rumors,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Mauro camp, who have criticized Bush for not
committing himself on the presidential question, urged the governor
to level with Texas voters.
</P>
<P>
   They point to the millions of dollars Bush has raised this year
outside of Texas as a sign of his intention to seek the presidency
in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush is running for president. He knows it and
everyone else knows it,'' said Billy Rogers, a spokesman for Mauro.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he was intent on focusing his energies on winning the
governor's race.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no focus group or poll that I can possibly run to
determine whether or not I want to make the commitment to leave
Texas and run for higher office,'' he said. ``I never ran for
governor to be president. I ran for governor to be the best
governor I could be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next spring I'll make up my mind _ not on polls, focus groups
or whether I can withstand the scrutiny. It will really be based
upon whether I want a change of lifestyle with a family I love a
lot.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Cynics will wonder why, if Susan Miller can really peek into the
future, she did not predict years ago that something called the
Internet would make her fortunes rise as an astrologer. But then,
Ms. Miller _ whose Astrology Zone is one of the most popular of its
kind on the Web, spawning a number of media spinoffs _ is
accustomed to wisecracks from those who doubt that the stars and
planets guide personal fates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people see astrology as fortune telling,'' she said.
``It's not. It's the study of cycles.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Miller, who is in her mid-40s (she won't be more specific)
learned astrology from her mother as a girl. And she did have some
early clues about where the cycles might take her _ and that
technology would play a role.
</P>
<P>
   ``My Aquarius was in Uranus,'' she explains. (There's more to an
astrological reading than the sun sign that even most nonbelievers
can identify.) ``I have Gemini rising, which means publishing, and
I'm a Pisces, which is philosophical. My moon is in Virgo, which
explains my voluminous manuscripts.'' But dotted throughout her
chart was the planet of things technological: Uranus.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I got on with my life, I knew something newly invented
would figure prominently in my career,'' Ms. Miller said. Which is
why, when Time Warner Electronic Publishing asked her in 1995 to
create an astrology Web site, ``I knew this would fulfill the
potential of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   What Ms. Miller did not know at the time was exactly what that
meant. She was already a personal computer devotee, having
discovered that software was a great aid in the complicated
mathematics involved in the ancient science of astrology _ which
calculates the placement of the planets at the precise time and
location on Earth of a person's birth, and continues that calculus
over the course of the person's life.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1995, the Web was new enough a medium that it would have
been hard for anyone to predict that with no publicity and a
difficult-to-find on-line address
(www.pathfinder.com/twep/astrology) that Astrology Zone would
become so popular that it would prompt a flurry of other media
deals: television commentaries on shows like Fox's ``Good Morning
New York''; a two-book contract with Warner Books, with the first
to be published in 1999; columns in magazines like McCall's, New
Woman Australia and Self; and a 900-number telephone service.
</P>
<P>
   Although neither of the leading Web-metering services, Media
Metrix or Relevant Knowledge, has comparative figures on astrology
sites, Ms. Miller said that her site attracted more than 1.3
million page views a month and had generated a mailing list of at
least 33,000 readers. Those readers log on for a detailed
commentary of the movement of the planets and an analysis of what
that means for each of the twelve signs of the zodiac _ as well as
the world at large.
</P>
<P>
   Well before the release of the Starr report, Ms. Miller wrote
about three eclipses coming in rapid succession _ an Aug. 7 lunar,
an Aug. 21 solar and a Sept. 6 lunar _ and discussed their
potential power:
</P>
<P>
   ``Close to eclipses, the media always bring news of world events
that stir us, no matter which side of the issue we happen to be on.
With any eclipse, the level of emotion is heightened, and it is
hard to think straight. No matter what comes up, don't rush to
judgment based on what you think is obvious. Eclipses push so much
information at us that it is hard to make sense of it all at once.
Sit back, think, read, reflect, talk, and think some more.''
</P>
<P>
   Another popular feature on the site is a match-making guide,
where readers can determine whether a love interest is
astrologically appropriate and figure out suitable gifts and
courting techniques according to sign. ``If you take your Scorpio
beloved out for dinner,'' she suggested to men trying to woo a
woman born under that sign, ``make it a private little dark
rendezvous, overlooking water if possible or, better yet, as a
guest on a private yacht (preferably yours).''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Miller _ who juggles her astrology ventures with the
photographers' agency Susan Miller Represents, which she runs with
her business partner, Evelyn Brady _ said she was no longer
surprised by the variety of people who were interested in her line
of work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the creative ones would be the only ones interested
in astrology,'' she said. ``I was afraid to tell techno-heads that
I was into this. But they were into it. Mathematicians, scientists,
people dealing in biology, were very intrigued as well.''
</P>
<P>
   The Web, Ms. Miller conjectured, allows people who might not
otherwise admit an interest in horoscopes to check out the stars in
relative privacy.
</P>
<P>
   That tendency has made astrology popular elsewhere on the
Internet, as well. America Online helped start Astro Net, based in
New Canaan, Conn., in 1995. Its creators say that 300,000 people
read its horoscopes each day, and America Online officials confirm
that Astro Net has become one of the online service's most popular
features.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a business standpoint, there are a lot of people who
`don't believe in astrology,' but a lot of people who read their
horoscopes,'' said Eugenie Diserio, president of Astro Net.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Purveying broad advice, rather than predicting specific
incidents, is what Ms. Miller sees as the role of astrology. But it
was one such case, in late 1994, that sent her into the business
from her original career as an agent for commercial photographers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was selling photographs to Warner Books because they needed
cover art, and portraits,'' Ms. Miller said in explaining her
accidental foray into the business of calculating charts.
</P>
<P>
   To the creative director, Jackie Meyer, she confided her
astrology skills, and thanked her for the business by reading her
charts over lunch. ``I told her I would like her to buy a lottery
ticket the last two weeks of December,'' Ms. Miller said. ``She
said, `I never win,' and I said, `Just buy something.' ''
</P>
<P>
   According to Ms. Miller, Ms. Meyer forgot that she had already
purchased a raffle ticket in the office, which resulted in a
telephone call on New Year's Eve telling her she had just won a
Porsche.
</P>
<P>
   ``She called and said, `I have 30 editors outside my door who
want to meet you,' '' remembered Ms. Miller, who credits that bit
of soothsaying as the incident that pushed her out of the
astrological closet. Ms. Meyer ultimately offered her a book
contract, and offered her up as a candidate for the site she now
runs.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Miller, who earned a degree in business from New York
University, is pragmatic about her calling.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think things are fated,'' Ms. Miller said. ``I am
dealing with probability. When you are in a good cycle, your
probability statistics are high. When things are going against you,
I don't want you taking big risks. When you're in a tough cycle,
there's always somewhere in your chart that's good.''

With release of Office, what else for the Mac? 
By Charles Haddad  
c. 1998 Cox News Serivce  
<TEXT>
<P>
   True to its word, Microsoft this year released a long-awaited
new version of its Office suite of applications for the Mac market.
</P>
<P>
   The suite, which includes Word and Excel, has won generally
favorable reviews, sold well and is credited with helping to boost
Apple Computer's once sagging fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   But does Office represent the extent of Microsoft's renewed
commitment to the Mac platform? Many hope not and are calling for
the world's largest software developer to make more products for
the Mac.
</P>
<P>
   The loudest and most influential voice in this rising chorus is
Don Crabb, who writes a weekly online column.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is time for Mr. Jobs (Apple Computer Chief Executive Steven
Jobs) to visit Mr. Gates ... turn on his patented and effective
reality distortion field ... and convince them to start making an
across-the-board Microsoft commitment to the Mac,'' Crabb wrote in
a recent column.
</P>
<P>
   In fairness, Microsoft does make a lot of Mac software now. The
list includes such important products as Internet Explorer, Word,
Excel, Front Page and a World War II simulation game called Close
Combat. The company remains the single largest publisher of Mac
software.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, there are many Microsoft titles that are not
published for the Mac. They include the database Access, a personal
information manager Outlook and desktop publishing software
Publisher.
</P>
<P>
   Now each of these products would face serious competition from
Mac counterparts such as FileMaker, Now Up-To-Date and Print Shop.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Microsoft President Steve Ballmer recently said as much
in an online interview on Pioneer Planet Web site. ``There's no
economic return,'' Ballmer was quoted as saying. ``The cost of
rewriting the software to run on the Macintosh would be greater
than the (sales) revenue.''
</P>
<P>
   To Crabb that's a lot of hooey. He argues the Office suite is as
expensive and complex to develop as anything, and yet it has proved
hugely popular on the Mac.
</P>
<P>
   ``Less complex and expensive-to-develop education software
titles like Encarta or My Personal Tutor would take fewer resources
to produce, yet they would be category-killers on the Mac,'' wrote
Crabb.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, what Crabb fails to point out is that there are many
Mac developers who wouldn't welcome a greater Microsoft presence in
the market. After all, what Microsoft might be killing is their
software.

Online publishing has a rich tradition 
By Bill Husted  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Electronic books and magazines are trendy. There are more
publishers on the Web than in New York these days. But publishing a
book electronically isn't a new idea.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the biggest and most important electronic publishing
project began way back in 1971. In those days, the World Wide Web
didn't exist, 1-megabyte files were considered enormous, and
computers were reserved for professionals or hobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   It was within that context that Project Gutenberg began. A
fellow named Michael Hart was given an operator's account on the
Xerox Sigma V mainframe at the Materials Research Lab at the
University of Illinois. The notion was to create electronic texts
of documents in the public domain. Hart laboriously typed in the
text of the Declaration of Independence.
</P>
<P>
   Project Gutenberg is still around.
</P>
<P>
   And _ now that computer memories are enormous and high-speed
modems and data connections make it easy to transfer large files _
you can browse one of the world's largest free libraries in
electronic form from now until the end of your days and still not
read everything available. Go to http://sailor
</P>
<P>
   .gutenberg.org/by-title.html to get a notion of the range of the
titles there.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, you can download and read ``The Adventures of Tom
Sawyer'' one week and come back for ``Chemical Strategy in Peace
and War'' the next.
</P>
<P>
   A browser's paradise
</P>
<P>
   Just browsing the titles can be fun. You'll find ``Cicero's
Orations'' located not far away from President Clinton's
inauguration speech. ``The Communist Manifesto'' lives as a
friendly neighbor with ``The Compleat Angler.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the documents can be downloaded to your PC in the form
of plain ASCI text (which can be read by any word processor). Or,
if you want to speed the download, you can get the document in
compressed form as a ZIP file (a program such as PKUNZIP is needed
to decompress it ... you'll find decompression programs at a site
called Shareware.Com at http://www
</P>
<P>
   .shareware.com among other places).
</P>
<P>
   Another terrific source of online books is the University of
Virginia Electronic Text Library. Besides the selection of books in
English you'll also be able to find books and documents in Chinese,
German, French, Hebrew, Latin, Russian, Spanish and the
ever-popular Tibetan and Icelandic.
</P>
<P>
   Check in with Alex
</P>
<P>
   You'll also want to drop in at the Alex Catalogue at http://
</P>
<P>
   sunsite.berkeley.edu/alex/. Like the other sites, you'll be able
to search by author or title, and you'll also find links to other
electronic libraries.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, check out a site called Project Bartleby at http://www
</P>
<P>
   .columbia.edu/acis/bartleby/. As you can see from the address,
it's located at Columbia University's College of Education. The
selection isn't as broad here, but there are some works that seem
unique to Bartleby.
</P>
<P>
   While most of us will prefer reading the old-fashioned way,
settled comfortably in a good chair on a lazy Sunday, electronic
texts have advantages that you may overlook. For instance, if
you're a student, you'll be able to use the search features in your
word processor to find references to specific terms. And, you'll
also be able to cut and paste when you need to quote from some of
these works.
</P>
<P>
   Or, use the electronic text as a sampler. Since books can be
expensive, you can use the electronic version to take a taste of an
unfamiliar work and then decide if you want to invest in the print
edition.

Hunting game misses mark 
By Yusuf Davis  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Rocky Mountain Trophy Hunter''
</P>
<P>
   (For PCs, by Wizard Works, http://www.wizworks.com, $24.99)
</P>
<P>
   David Sponaas of Duluth says ``Rocky Mountain Trophy Hunter''
might be good for some gamers, but not for him. He said the CD-ROM
hunting program was neither educational nor a challenge to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of corny, and it wasn't that much fun,'' the
15-year-old reviewer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trophy Hunter,'' an interactive hunting game, lets players
track and shoot big-game animals in the wilds of the Rocky
Mountains. Players hunt for bighorn sheep, bear, elk and moose in a
variety of environments and may select from weapons including
shotgun, rifle, compound bow, muzzle loader and six-shot revolver.
</P>
<P>
   As in real life, hunters track animals using calls, bait and
binoculars and must deal with extreme weather conditions such as
rain, snow, and thunder and lightning.
</P>
<P>
   Tracking methods also include aerial maps, with hot-spot
markers, compass and wind indicator, path and bedding areas, and
rubbing and droppings. There are even blood trails, for when errant
shots don't bring an animal down immediately. Players must always
be mindful of wind direction and choose location accordingly,
because if the animals detect a hunter's scent, they will turn and
run.
</P>
<P>
   Successful hunters get to display their kills in a trophy room.
</P>
<P>
   David said that despite the maker's claim of an ultra-realistic
hunting environment, the graphics of ``Trophy Hunter'' were ``not
all that good, and the scenery and the animals sometimes didn't
seem to match.'' He didn't like the sounds either.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was too time-consuming trying to find the animals, and the
game got kind of repetitive,'' David said.

   New sites promote
</P>
<P>
   safer Net surfing
</P>
<P>
   Despite possible hazards, there are many great ways young people
can use the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Some simple rules for surfing the Net or participating in chat
areas can help kids preserve their innocence and possibly save
their lives.
</P>
<P>
   A number of ways to make Web surfing safe for kids are outlined
on a new Web site, called SafeKids.com, http://www.safekids.com,
which premiered last month. The site is the brainchild of Larry
Magid, child online safety advocate, technology journalist and
national Internet expert. Magid is also the author of the National
Center for Missing and Exploited Children's popular booklets,
``Child Safety on the Information Highway'' and ``Teen Safety on
the Information Highway.''
</P>
<P>
   SafeKids.com provides specific steps parents can take to teach
their children critical thinking about safety and privacy and to
improve communication with children and teens about what is or is
not good for them.
</P>
<P>
   SafeKids.com includes links to informative sites for kids,
parents and teachers, links to child-safe search engines and a
complete directory of parental control programs, or ``filters,''
which automatically determine the sites a youngster may access.
</P>
<P>
   A site for teens, SafeTeens
</P>
<P>
   .com (http://www.safeteens
</P>
<P>
   .com), was also launched in September.
</P>
<P>
   The two sites will be updated regularly and serve as a resource
for the America Links Up Campaign, which started Sept. 14.
</P>
<P>
   Magid says that while filtering software is an option,
parent-child communication is a more critical component to
protecting children in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to talk with your kids about how to behave in
cyberspace,'' Magid said. ``The purpose of SafeKids.com and
SafeTeens.com is to help users better understand the issues and
their options and take responsibility themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about critical thinking. The judgment skills kids
learn surfing the Net will serve them in all aspects of life,''
Magid said. ``Filters, like crossing guards, have their place. But
eventually kids have to learn to look both ways when the crossing
guard isn't around.''
</P>
<P>
   SafeKids.com and SafeTeens
</P>
<P>
   .com approach cyber-safety in different ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``While young children usually pay attention and obey what their
parents teach them, teens have a tendency to push up against
authority,'' Magid said. ``At SafeKids.com, we educate parents
about how to work with their children. At SafeTeens
</P>
<P>
   .com, we communicate directly with teens to empower their
Internet skills, encourage them to avoid the unsavory side of the
Internet and help them educate their parents about the online
world.''
</P>
<P>
   September was also the premiere of the SafeKids newsletter
(subscribe(at)safekids.com), a free weekly e-mail that informs
parents and teachers about new sites and Internet child-related
developments. It is compiled for SafeKids.com by the staff of
SageWay.com, a leading child advocacy site.
</P>
<P>
   The sites' initial corporate sponsors include America Online,
Disney.com, Network Solutions and SmarterKids.com. Yahoo!, Lycos,
TalkCity, Link Exchange and 1WEBCAST are providing promotional
support. Additional assistance is provided by the National Center
for Missing and Exploited Children.

Check-It 98 utility is valuable tool for PC 
By Jack Warner  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   At last, there is hope of a good night's sleep. No more fear, no
more fretting. My computer is ready for the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, I have never worried about whether my computer was
ready for what us computer geeks knowingly refer to as Y2K. The
major question is whether I am ready for the millennium, and so far
as I am aware there is no software available to prepare me for it.
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, software to prepare a PC for the coming of
2000.
</P>
<P>
   It is part of a large suite of utilities called Check-It 98,
from Touchstone. Check-It, however, is more interesting from a
standpoint of what it tells you than what it does. It provides an
enormous amount of information on your system, and runs a great
many internal tests to make certain everything is working properly.
</P>
<P>
   If it finds something wrong, then either the program or the
manuals packed with it will provide some advice on what to do. In
terms of cures, Check-It provides very little. Its system tuneup,
for instance, consists of running Windows 95's ScanDisk and Disk
Defragmenter.
</P>
<P>
   But in terms of testing and presenting detailed information on a
computer's components, I've seen nothing to equal it. It will run
separate tests on the drives, the system memory, the modem, the
motherboard, the ports and the video. It provides extremely
detailed information on all those items plus your Internet setup,
PCI bus, printer, available resources, SCSI setup if any, sound
system, PCMCIA cards. USB port, power management, networking and
other things so arcane that I'm not sure what they are.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the time, of course, this information is of no use at
all to the average user. However, let's say you're trying to
install a new video card and you can't seem to make it work. You
call the maker of the card for tech support. If a few usual
approaches don't work, one of the things the technician is going to
ask you is, ``What motherboard are you using?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The one that came with my computer'' is not the right answer.
There's every chance that the documentation that came with your
computer isn't going to tell you, either. This is part of the
information that Check-It provides; my motherboard is an Intel 686,
Model 5, Revision 1, with the Intel 440BX revision 2 chipset.
</P>
<P>
   The technician might also ask about your PCI bus, and Check-It
will provide you with enough information to melt his pocket
protector.
</P>
<P>
   There is a Tools section that allows you to maintain a benchmark
routine for your computer. It tests every portion of it, records
the results and compares them to the next set of benchmark tests
you run. This tells you whether something is gradually going south.
It will also back up a handful of files it considers most critical
to the operation, and restore them if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Check-It also comes with FastMove, a utility for the quick
transfer of files between two computers and a serial cable to
accomplish it, and with NetOptimizer, a modem utility I reviewed
and found very useful.
</P>
<P>
   Check-It is a very good utility to have, even for its rather
steep $90 price tag. Most users, unfortunately but understandably,
don't find utilities very sexy. If you wait until you've got a
problem to get something like this, it will help, but not nearly as
much as it would if you had been running it regularly before the
trouble came along.

Many users hold pocket-size computer close to the heart 
By Charles Haddad  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``There goes Dad, writing in his diary again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' I correct my wife. ``It's my personal digital
assistant.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you hear that, Matt?'' my wife calls out to my son. ``It's
his personal digital assistant.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah right,'' scoffs my son.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well it is,'' I insist and stomp off to the closet of my room.
In my dark seclusion I have to admit my wife and son are right. The
PalmPilot I coddle in my hand has become as personal to me as a
diary.
</P>
<P>
   I use this pocket-size computer to jot down ideas, keep a
running grocery list, record when I've exercised and to remind me
of key appointments. And that's in addition to the PalmPilot's
electronic calendar, address book, calculator and to-do list.
</P>
<P>
   It truly has become my confidant, if a cruel one at times. I
won't soon forget the time it died during a change of batteries,
wiping out all my data. No diary I've ever kept treated me so
harshly. Still I wouldn't turn in my PalmPilot.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not alone in my affection for the PalmPilot. Just listen to
what TidBits writer Jeff Carlson said about this hand-held
computer: ``Take away my blender and I'll switch to a spoon. Try to
take my PalmPilot and I'll reach for a knife.''
</P>
<P>
   You tell 'em, Jeff.
</P>
<P>
   The PalmPilot has become the Mac of the late 1990s, developing a
vocal cult following. And what do followers do in this age? They
publish Web sites in honor of their beloved.
</P>
<P>
   There are scores of them for the PalmPilot, but here are a few
of the better ones: PalmLife at http://www.palmlife.com/; The
Pickled PalmPilot at http://www
</P>
<P>
   .pickled.com/ and Palm Planet at http://palmtopplanet.interspeed
</P>
<P>
   .net/palm/palmplanet.shtml.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the PalmPilot so endearing? The reasons are many.
</P>
<P>
   For one, the PalmPilot is the right size. At 4.7 inches tall and
3.1 inches wide and less than an inch thick, it fits in almost any
pocket. It runs on two AA batteries that can power the thing for up
to a month.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the PalmPilot is convenient, made even more so
because it's always on (if the batteries aren't dead) and you can
write on it.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not kidding. The PalmPilot really does recognize handwriting
in two ways. You can tap out words and numbers with the PalmPilot's
stylus on a little keyboard that appears on the bottom of the
screen.
</P>
<P>
   Or you can write directly on the screen. What you write isn't
English but a shorthand language that's easy to learn and
understand. It's part of the software called Graffiti that comes
with the PalmPilot. Graffiti turns that shorthand into English.
Forget a shorthand symbol and you can call up a directory of the
language on the PalmPilot.
</P>
<P>
   The ability to easily write transforms the PalmPilot from just
an interesting electronic gadget into something truly useful. You
can whip out your PalmPilot and jot down notes, appointments and
reminders nearly anywhere at any time. Then you can save and
categorize this information later at your convenience.
</P>
<P>
   This ease of use, reminiscent of the Mac, characterizes
everything about the PalmPilot. There's four buttons along the
bottom that let you jump immediately to your address book,
calendar, notes or to-do list.
</P>
<P>
   And like the Mac, the PalmPilot display screen includes a top
menu bar. From there you can copy, paste, edit or remove items.
Instead of clicking a mouse you tap the commands with the stylus.
There's also a find command that lets you quickly search for
things.
</P>
<P>
   While Mac-like, the PalmPilot is not particularly Mac-friendly.
For starters, many Mac users have complained it's difficult and
sometimes impossible to back up their PalmPilot data on a desktop
Mac. I experienced this same problem. On PCs, the transfer of data
is a breeze.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is there much Mac software for the PalmPilot. The opposite
is true for the PC model, which supports scores of applications.
</P>
<P>
   To 3Com's credit, it is trying to correct this imbalance. Last
spring it bought the first-rate personal information manager Claris
Organizer from Apple Computer. The company plans to refashion
Organizer as the core software of the Mac version of PalmPilot.
This software is expected to be released sometime this fall.
</P>
<P>
   PalmPilot's success, the first for a hand-held computer, has not
gone unnoticed. A score of other computer makers, including Casio,
Sharp and NEC, have entered the market with new products. Many of
them are using a specially-adapted version of Microsoft's Windows
operating system.
</P>
<P>
   These new machines are adding things not included in the
PalmPilot. The Casio Cassiopeia A-10, for example, lets you dictate
notes. Other machines have color screens and let you write and
print memos.
</P>
<P>
   None of these competitors have yet knocked the PalmPilot from
first place, with its million-plus sales. Still the race has just
begun.
</P>
<P>
   THE PALMPILOT III AT A GLANCE
</P>
<P>
   Dimensions: 4.7 inches by 3.1 inches and 0.6 inches thick. It
weighs less than 6 ounces.
</P>
<P>
   Price: $399; an older, less capable version is still available
for $199
</P>
<P>
   Power: Runs on 2 AA batteries, which power the PalmPilot for up
to a month.
</P>
<P>
   Microprocessor: Motorola
</P>
<P>
   Maker: 3Com, which also owns modem brand U.S. Robotics
</P>
<P>
   Operating system: Unique to the PalmPilot, it's called Pilot
Desktop.
</P>
<P>
   Screen: 160 pixels, black and white, touch sensitive
</P>
<P>
   Capacity: 20,000 names, calendar appointments and other assorted
information.
</P>
<P>
   Availability: There's a model each for Mac and Windows
computers, to which you can back up information. It's sold in most
computer stores, including discount chains such as Home Depot and
OfficeMax.

 SMALL BUSINESS: Web Sites Cater to Women With Startups 
By Jon Swartz   
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Female entrepreneurs now have a new network of sorts to get
their businesses off the ground. Small-business Web sites for women
are big on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   There are prominent home pages that offer advice and contacts on
how to jump-start a startup and keep that venture profitable. No
surprise there, industry experts point out, since nearly half of
the Net's users are women today, compared with just 10 percent a
few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Women own more than 8 million businesses in the United States
that employ 18.5 million people and generate $2.3 trillion in
sales, according to the National Foundation for Women Business
Owners in Silver Spring, Md.
</P>
<P>
   The Web is particularly well suited for entrepreneurs because it
provides low-cost communication, information and networking.
</P>
<P>
   `A Great Connector'
</P>
<P>
   ``Because a lot of women start businesses from home, the
Internet is a great connector and equalizer,'' said Ellen Pack,
founder of San Mateo's Women.com Networks (www.women.com), a Web
portal that is home to six small-business sites.
</P>
<P>
   Women.com Network's properties include MoneyMode and Women's
Wire, which ``give women the tools and resources to start a
company, raise money and acquire office equipment,'' said Laurie
Kretchmar, editor-in-chief of Women's Wire.
</P>
<P>
   Another useful site is WomenConnect.com (www.womenconnect.com),
a McLean, Va., service for female business owners and
professionals.
</P>
<P>
   Started on Prodigy in 1994, it offers tips on handling debt and
equity capital issues (most women finance startups on credit
cards), and a free directory of female business owners for
networking purposes.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, WomenConnect.com creates Web sites for nonprofit,
membership-based professional women's business organizations,
according to Gary LaFever, senior vice president of business
development.
</P>
<P>
   Another company, iVillage.com: The Women's Network
(www.ivillage.com), takes the approach of creating Web communities.
It pulls women together through a variety of e-mail, chat rooms,
message boards and content sections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of our users want expert advice on what businesses to
start and how to finance a business,'' said iVillage producer
Shelley Pyne-Hanley. ``We point them in the right direction and
offer a nurturing online environment.''
</P>
<P>
   The high-profile New York company has received backing from
America Online, the Tribune Co. and Kleiner Perkins Caufield &AMP;
Byers, the influential Menlo Park venture-capital firm.
</P>
<P>
   Sites to Explore
</P>
<P>
   Other notable Web sites for female business owners:
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Women's Work &LR;  (wwork.com /) boasts plenty of resources for job
seekers, including employment opportunities, a software program
that allows people to electronically post resumes, and a listing of
women's business organizations from California to Maine.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Business Women's Network &LR;  (www.tpag.com/BWN/publications.html)
hawks publications for the serious female entrepreneur, ranging
from the Business Women's Network Directory 1998-1999 ($110) to the
Business Women's Update Newsletter ($18 a year), a bimonthly
calendar of events.

SCHROEDER'S STANCE HEARTENS WOULD-BE GERMAN CITIZENS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ Like all seven million foreigners living in Germany,
Nazim Gucer couldn't vote in the recent general election. But he
cheered Gerhard Schroeder on to victory.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder, who ousted Helmut Kohl as chancellor on Sept. 27,
campaigned on a promise to ease Germany's stringent citizenship
laws, which since 1913 have been based on blood, not place of birth
or allegiance.
</P>
<P>
   Under these laws, which other European nations consider
anachronistic, the descendants of Germans who settled in the United
States or elsewhere centuries ago are still of German blood and can
return to claim citizenship. But the children and grandchildren of
the Turkish ``guest workers'' who arrived here in the 1960s must
remain ``guests,'' as they are legally defined.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to become a German citizen,'' said Gucer,
standing behind the counter of his small East Berlin restaurant,
the Kastanian Grill. ``This is my home now.''
</P>
<P>
   Gucer, 27, came here from Turkey three years ago, taught himself
passable German and opened one of Germany's ubiquitous
``imbisses,'' or cafes, that offer good, cheap food.
</P>
<P>
   Aout two million Turks live in Germany _ the largest ethnic
group other than native Germans. But interaction between Turks and
native Germans is limited almost exclusively to the transactions
conducted in imbisses or other businesses run by Turks.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder has vowed to make changing the citizenship laws one of
his top priorities. He hopes it will improve the integration of
immigrants with the 75 million Germans born here. Critics of the
citizenship law charge that it smacks of the same Aryan superiority
complex that wrought so much suffering in the first half of the
century and has contributed to much of Germany's internal problems
in more recent years. They add that it also has provided a legal
underpinning to racism and xenophobia.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, there was a rash of attacks against Turkish
families. At the height of the violence, Kohl was criticized for
not attending the funerals of a Turkish family, including three
children, who were killed when neo-Nazis firebombed their home.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl refused to liberalize the citizenship laws, in part because
his coalition was under pressure from far-right parties whose calls
for the expulsion of foreigners resonate across a broad swath of
the population.
</P>
<P>
   Critics charged that Kohl's Christian Democratic Union party
refused to change the laws because they are prejudiced. But Kohl
had political reasons too. Citing recent polls showing that up to
70 percent of foreigners supported Schroeder over Kohl, Kohl's
party charged that Schroeder's haste to change the law amounts to a
power grab.
</P>
<P>
   Some studies have suggested as many as 4 million new voters
could be created by changing the citizenship laws - and as many as
85 percent of them have indicated they would vote for Schroeder's
party or the environmentalist Green Party, which will be junior
partner in a coalition government led by Schroeder's Social
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition partners differ on who should benefit from the
change. The Social Democrats favor citizenship for third-generation
immigrants - those with at least one parent born in Germany. The
Greens argue that second-generation immigrants should get it. Both
parties agree that any child born in Germany should be a citizen.
</P>
<P>
   Cem Ozdemir, 33, a Green Party member, is one of only two ethnic
Turks in the 670-seat Bundestag, Germany's parliament. Born here of
Turkish parents, Ozdemir had to renounce his Turkish nationality to
become a citizen. He says the denial of dual citizenship denies the
foreign-born opportunities for training and jobs that would improve
integration and cross-cultural understanding.
</P>
<P>
   Foreigners are excluded from teaching, the civil service and
many professions. Some of the prohibitions are protectionist, while
others are simply unfathomable. Until last April, for example,
chimney sweeps had to be German.
</P>
<P>
   But even if Schroeder changes the law, he cannot legislate the
way people feel. While the stereotypical German racist is a
neo-Nazi skinhead, many ordinary Germans also resent what they
consider the exploitation of the welfare system by immigrants or
the expropriation of jobs from Germans by working for less money.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to persuade middle-class Germans to articulate
their feelings about foreigners because they don't want to be seen
as racist. Standing outside Gucer's imbiss, Jens and Karin Scholler
had no such reservations. They candidly identified themselves as
supporters of extremist parties that spout blatantly racist slogans
against foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   Jens Scholler, 27, wore a tee shirt that said, ``Into the German
Millenium, the German Fatherland.'' Their 7-month-old son Odin,
named after a German god, sat gurgling in his stroller, dressed in
a baby's version of a U-boat crew member.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are German construction workers unemployed and there are
foreigners working at all the construction sites for 3 marks an
hour, a fraction of what the Germans should be paid,'' said Jens
Scholler, who drives a streetsweeper for the municipal government.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, 30, said foreigners routinely work for reduced wages,
taking jobs from Germans. She complained that she had recently lost
her job in a day care center. When pressed, she acknowledged her
layoff had nothing to do with foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no problem with foreigners who come here and work, but
there are many who don't,'' she said. ``I grew up in East Germany,
and there were always foreigners who came in, learned skills, then
went back to their own countries. That's how it should be here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Schollers maintain that most foreigners don't want
citizenship, but prefer to undercut German wages or milk the
welfare system.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives here have refused to countenance altering the laws
on the grounds that such a change would flood the country with more
immigrants and trigger the collapse of a social welfare system
already strained. But more liberal Germans believe that it is time
to become more like the rest of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Connie Saupe, 21, a student from East Berlin, said she favors
easing the requirements for foreigners to become citizens providing
they make an effort to learn German. Saupe, who lived in Texas for
a year, said she was struck by the cultural melange in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Germany, there is no mixing. The Turks stick to their own
people and culture. Germans just eat their food,'' she said. ``I
think if you change the law, there would be more of an incentive
for foreigners to mix with Germans, and for Germans to accept
them.''

 Keeping Your E-Mail Address From Spammers  
 By David Einstein   
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Q:  &LR; I've been getting more and more junk e-mail lately. Can you
tell me where these spammers are getting my address, and is there
anything I can do to protect my privacy?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A:  &LR; There are several ways a Web site can get your e-mail
address. It can ask you for it as part of an information form
required to receive an online service. Or it can plant a ``cookie''
in your system that transmits your address every time you visit a
certain Web page. Unless a Web site states up front that it won't
sell your address, nothing prevents it from doing so.
</P>
<P>
   A good way to prevent dissemination of personal information is
to use an anonymous Web-surfing service such as Anonymizer
(www.anonymizer.com) or Lucent Personal Web Assistant
(www.lpwa.com). They act as middlemen between your browser and the
Web, replacing your e-mail address and IP address with anonymous
ones. Lucent's service is free, but Anonymizer, which has some
extra security features, costs $15 for three months. (You can try
it for free, however.)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  I've been thinking about getting a digital camera, mostly
because it would let me send photos of my kids to my parents, who
live on the East Coast. But the wide choice of cameras is a little
daunting. They run from $200 to more than $1,000, and the
technology is bewildering. Is there a way to get advice on buying
one?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A:  &LR; A good source of information on digital cameras and
computer products is www.computershopper.com/, a Web site run by
Ziff-Davis. There's a how-to-buy guide, plus info on different
brands of cameras.
</P>
<P>
   If you want my advice (or even if you don't), the first things
to look for in a digital camera are the level of picture resolution
and the quality of the lens. Entry-level cameras have a resolution
of 640-by-480, which isn't really enough for sharp pictures on a
computer screen and is much less than you need if you plan to print
your photos. Insist on at least 1024-by-768, which is now widely
available on cameras costing more than $500.
</P>
<P>
   The lens is equally important. Less-expensive cameras often use
plastic lenses, and even the glass lenses on some high-end models
are tiny compared with the lens on a P4''ZAN)Q%w &QC; i}w;&AMP;W &UR; s. &LR;

COMPUTER ADVICE REMAINS CONSTANT: LEARN THE LANGUAGE, BUY ENOUGH 
MEMORY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   (Eds: This is the final Personal Computers column in Science
Times.  Starting on Oct. 15, the Circuits section, on Thursdays,
will introduce a column by Peter H. Lewis, who will write about new
products and other computer industry developments of interest to
consumers.) 
 By ROB FIXMER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In June 1982, the IBM personal computer, only a few months on
the market, offered a maximum of 256 kilobytes of memory, a choice
of one or two floppy disk drives and an optional color monitor.
Fully configured, it cost close to $7,000.
</P>
<P>
   Most buyers took the standard features _ a single floppy, a
green-and-white monitor and 64 kilobytes of memory _ which kept the
price under $4,000. A hard drive was not an option, but the entire
operating system, which IBM had purchased from a 32-person company
called Microsoft, fit easily on one 128-K floppy disk with room to
spare.
</P>
<P>
   That PC was not a technological marvel even by the standards of
its day, but it carried the three-letter monogram of the
International Business Machines Corp., which elevated the
perception of the personal computer to the level of a serious
business tool in board rooms around the world.
</P>
<P>
   While the corporate world focused on the IBM PC, another market
for the computer was being built around sales to a growing number
of consumers who wanted computers in their homes for work and play.
</P>
<P>
   That trend was reflected in a new column called Personal
Computing, which made its debut in Science Times on June 22, 1982.
Aimed not at business users of the new IBM but at what it described
as the ``home computer market,'' the column's first headline
offered, ``How Much Memory to Buy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The memory range available in the home computer market now
goes all the way from 8 to 128K,'' the columnist, Erik
Sandberg-Diment, wrote. The computers from which to choose in this
range, he said, were ``the Apple II+ (selling for under $2,000),
the Commodore 64 ($595), Radio Shack's TRS-80, Model II ($5,048) or
the Osborne ($1,795).''
</P>
<P>
   One measure of how much about personal computers has changed in
the last 16 years is the fact that of the computer manufacturers
represented in his list, only Apple is still an industry leader.
But as Sandberg-Diment wrote his first column, the seeds of far
more significant changes had been sown that would eventually blur
the line between business and home computers, making the PC truly
personal. Among the most important developments were these:
</P>
<P>
   _ In Texas, the concept for a computer that used the same
hardware and operating system as the IBM personal computer _ but
that would sell for about half the price _ was sketched on a paper
napkin as three Texas Instruments engineers had lunch. That sketch
was realized in the first IBM ``clone,'' a computer that looked
like a portable sewing machine and went by the name Compaq but ran
any program made for the IBM. The Compaq eventually surpassed IBM's
share of the market and became the world's largest manufacturer of
personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   _ In California, Steven Jobs, chief executive of Apple Computer,
was rushing to adopt two revolutionary concepts he had come across
in a recent visit to the Xerox Corp.'s Palo Alto Research Center _
a pointing device called a mouse and an operating system built
around a ``graphical user interface.'' Both technologies became the
foundation of a new relationship between people and machines with
the introduction of the Macintosh, in January 1984.
</P>
<P>
   _ In Washington State, William Gates and Paul Allen, owners of
the company that one year earlier had licensed a second-hand
operating system to IBM, were planning new features for MS-DOS and
new programs to run on it. Their efforts eventually gave Microsoft
_ and, significantly, not IBM _ the power to dictate the direction
of the world's fastest-growing industry.
</P>
<P>
   _ Throughout the United States, a decentralized network designed
to enable academic and military researchers to share ideas and text
was rapidly connecting more and more campuses and laboratories. It
used the technology that evolved into the Internet and transformed
the personal computer into a window on a vast new frontier,
cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, despite all that was about to change about the personal
computer, Sandberg-Diment's first column offered consumers a couple
of remarkably prescient observations that are as valid today as
they were in the summer of '82.
</P>
<P>
   ``Understanding the concepts involved,'' he wrote of the
personal computer, ``should be among the very first chores anyone
attempting to buy one masters. But it isn't easy, and it requires a
certain amount of concentration and a willingness to forgive
jargon.''
</P>
<P>
   A few paragraphs later, he noted that ``once you get started you
will always yearn for as much memory as you can possibly have, and
there will always be models with more memory than you've got
because bigger and more sophisticated programs requiring ever
larger quantities of memory are always on the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, buying a computer is still a process of trying to
understand the value of imponderables like DVD, PCI, USB and a 100
megahertz bus. Once we have sifted through all the jargon, the
bottom line is that Windows 98 will not run properly with less than
32 megabytes of memory, and any serious user will install twice
that much _ or 500 times the memory of the most powerful machines
described in that first Personal Computers column.
</P>
<P>
   And, yes, users could still use just a little more. After all,
the machines people buy today can handle up to 384 megabytes of
memory, which is 1,500 times the maximum of the original IBM
personal computer. The current standard size of the hard drive on a
new computer is about 6 gigabytes, almost 47,000 times the size of
its original floppy drive.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, in some ways, what has changed most about the personal
computer is the number of people who use one. In 1982, computers
had found their way into fewer than 2 percent of all households in
the United States. Today, more than 40 percent of all homes have at
least one computer, and by some estimates two or more computers are
at work in almost 12 percent of households.
</P>
<P>
   And those are just the machines that we think of as computers _
contraptions that have display screens and keyboards and disk
drives and modems. In truth, the computer is invisibly ubiquitous;
its processing power controls hundreds of gadgets in our lives,
from our cars to our telephones and stereos. In fact, as dozens of
new computer-powered devices are unveiled, it is becoming almost
impossible to distinguish what is a computer from what is not.

NEW DATA SHOW CARE IMPROVED FOR AGED, DYING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADAM PERTMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALEM, Ore. _ Authorities have reported 10 incidents of legally
sanctioned doctor-assisted suicide to date, far fewer than some
critics had predicted when the statute took effect.
</P>
<P>
   One principal reason appears to be a pronounced but
little-heralded consequence of the law: It has focused such sharp
attention on the needs of the dying that doctors, hospice workers,
and legislators _ including those who oppose assisted suicide _
have accelerated health-care improvements.
</P>
<P>
   As a consequence, according to a range of health professionals,
a growing number of critically ill patients are comfortable enough
that they don't need to end their lives. ``By any measure, our
state has really made substantial changes for the better on pain
and suffering issues relating to the end of life,'' said Dr.
Patrick Dunn, who headed the task force that drew up guidelines for
carrying out assisted suicides.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Susan Tolle, director of the Center for Ethics in Health
Care at Oregon Health Sciences University, said extensive
conversations with doctors and other empirical evidence also
indicate fewer physicians are helping people die in Oregon today
than before the law took effect.
</P>
<P>
   She said that there are now legal criteria they can follow,
whereas before they had to help dying patients surrepticiously and
without guidance. Tolle, who stressed that she has taken no
position on assisted suicide, added that medical authorities who
used to look the other way now have a specific statute to follow
and enforce.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to buttressing medical assistance for the aged and
the terminally ill in Oregon, there are several other barometers
that appear to bolster the assertion that the assisted-suicide law
has stimulated improvements in the treatment of patients during
their final days. Among them are:
</P>
<P>
   -- The number of Oregonians choosing to die in hospitals has
fallen each year since the statute was enacted, apparently because
home care has improved. Thirty-one percent died in hospitals in
1997, the lowest rate in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   -- The number dying in hospice care also has risen annually,
climbing to 30 percent last year. The only states that rival this
rate are Florida, Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona _ all of which
have disproportionate numbers of retirees, which Oregon does not;
the elderly utilize hospices more than any other demographic group.
</P>
<P>
   -- Since 1994, Oregon has moved from 11th to first among states
in prescription rates for morphine. Moreover, doctors across the
country say they have increased their use of the powerful narcotic,
partly because of Oregon's experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Physician-assisted suicide is not a simple issue, but ... a
symptom of a much bigger national problem of adequate care at the
end of life,'' said Ann Jackson, executive director of the Oregon
Hospice Association. ``When patients discover that their last days
aren't necessarily going to have to be painful, they're empowered
to make different decisions.''

CAUTION CAN PREVENT VIRUS WOES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DAVID HOYE   
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Has your computer felt well lately?
</P>
<P>
   Had a touch of the flu? Maybe a . . . virus?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, we can joke all we want about computers and viruses. But
it's serious business, as proven by a recent survey conducted on
behalf of several major corporations, including Intel, Microsoft,
Price Waterhouse and Symantec.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 Computer Virus Prevalence Survey, which was based on
interviews with about 300 technology professionals who oversee more
than 750,000 PCs and servers across the country, concluded that
computer virus infection rates are increasing.
</P>
<P>
   This despite the widespread availability of anti-virus software
and the fact that most new computers come loaded with anti-virus
software.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 survey found more than 86.5 ``virus encounters'' per
1,000 machines per year, which is an increase from last year's
finding of 62.5 encounters per 1,000 machines per year.
</P>
<P>
   The most prevalent viruses were of the ``macro'' variety, and
included WM/Concept, WM/CAP, WM/Wazzu, WM/Npad and XM/Laroux. Macro
viruses usually are written in Word Basic, and hide within
documents such as Microsoft Word files.
</P>
<P>
   The WM/Concept virus, alone, accounted for nearly four
infections per 1,000 computers per month, the survey found.
</P>
<P>
   Why are virus infection rates increasing? The survey blames a
number of factors, including inadequate policies in offices around
the country to guide workers in their daily use of computers and
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   What's all this mean to the average computer user? Take
precautions, but don't panic.
</P>
<P>
   Make sure you have a decent anti-virus program loaded and
running in the background on your machine. Opinions vary on which
is best. Top sellers include Norton's, Dr. Solomon's, F-Prot and
McAfee. There are others as well, including some cheap and/or free
solutions available online.
</P>
<P>
   Exercise caution. Be wary of downloading files or programs from
independent computer bulletin boards or no-name Web sites. Scan
floppies for viruses before using them. Configure your e-mail
program to put any incoming attached files where you can see them
(like on your desktop) and make sure you scan them for viruses
before opening them.
</P>
<P>
   As I said, this isn't anything to panic over. People get run
over by cars every day, but that doesn't stop anyone from crossing
the street. They've just learned to look both ways before stepping
foot off the sidewalk!
</P>
<P>
   If you want to read more about viruses, there are many Web sites
available, including ciac.llnl.gov/ or www.symantec.com/avcenter/. &QL; 
New Mac OS to debut
</P>
<P>
   Attention Macintosh users: Apple's latest operating system, Mac
OS 8.5, will debut soon.
</P>

Voyeur search update
</P>
<P>
   Last week, I wrote about a couple search sites that allow
visitors to watch what others are searching for.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, I've received many e-mails about problems people are
having trying to connect with the sites.
</P>
<P>
   Here's why:
</P>
<P>
   The first site is webcrawler &QL; 
.com/SearchTicker.html. As I said in the column, there is no
``www'' at the beginning. But people had trouble with the URL
because they did not use an upper case ``S'' and ``T'' in the term
``SearchTicker.'' That makes all the difference in the world. If
you use a lower case ``s'' and ``t,'' you will get an error message
telling you the page no longer exists.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with the second site was our fault. Somehow, we
managed to erase an all-important ``k'' in the URL. The proper Web
address is: www.mckinley.com/. Once there, look on the right side
of the screen for the search voyeur icon and link. That will take
you where you want to go. &QL;

PRESIDENT'S EFFECTIVENESS QUESTIONED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MCGRORY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For months, questions have swirled around
Washington over whether the White House could effectively address
crises of policy while trying to overcome President Clinton's
crisis of character. Officials in the Congress and the
administration said the answer may begin to become apparent this
week.
</P>
<P>
   As the House casts a likely vote tomorrow in favor of an
impeachment inquiry, Clinton faces a litany of grave international
and domestic issues, from a world economic crisis that has spread
to Wall Street to possible battle in Kosovo to the potential
shutdown of the federal government in a budget standoff with the
Republican-controlled Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Some Clinton allies and political enemies said the president
appears to be strapped beyond compare, in a situation made worse by
the imminent departure of his chief of staff, Erskine B. Bowles,
and the role of deputy chief of staff John Podesta, who appears
consumed by efforts to stave off impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that the president is crippled by the
impeachment process,'' said Leon Panetta, Clinton's former chief of
staff. ``You just can't ignore it. The very psychology of the
moment doesn't help the president confront all these other crises
out here. You're trying to put out these other fires, but all the
fire engines are focused on the impeachment fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Will Marshall, president of the progressive Democratic
Leadership Council: ``The prospect of being impeached is a
monumental distraction.''
</P>
<P>
   Within the White House, officials said Clinton has devoted his
unswaying attention to the problems of the country and the world,
rather than his own political future. Aides said Clinton penned his
own speech Tuesday on the world economy, during which he warned the
Congress to approve an $18 billion payment to the International
Monetary Fund and urged other nations to take ``urgent steps.''
</P>
<P>
   Those officials also said Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin is
carefully monitoring economic indications, including the potential
collapse of Japan's leading banks. They added that Secretary of
State Madeleine K. Albright, who is currently in the Middle East
helping to prod along the peace process, is serving as an able
point person on foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strategic decisions are being made that need to be made,''
said Ann Lewis, the White House communications director. ``When you
have secretaries of the stature of Rubin and Albright, the work of
the country is getting done.''
</P>
<P>
   But, countered Panetta, Lewis's former boss: ``The problem is
focus. All these crises individually demand almost the full-time
attention of the president to deal with them. It's reached that
stage. This is something you no longer pitch to staff and cover
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics also contend that Clinton has always created and
overseen policy from the White House rather than the Cabinet
agencies and, indeed, rarely takes time to meet with the various
secretaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has met with his Cabinet twice this year: once to tell them
they shouldn't believe the stories about Monica Lewinsky and the
second time to say he was lying,'' said Clifford May, the
communications director for the Republican National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The number of domestic and foreign problems, friends and foes
alike said, is staggering, ranging from the spreading worldwide
recession to the plunging US stock markets to the budget showdown
with Congress. By last night, it remained unclear whether Clinton
and the Republican leadership would come to agreement on any
appropriations for the federal budget, with a likely deadline
looming by week's end, when the members of the House and Senate
plan to return home to their districts for the year to campaign for
reelection.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Albright is overseeing the most significant
push toward peace between Israelis and Palestinians in the last two
years. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat are due in Washington for a pivotal working
summit next week.
</P>
<P>
   And in Europe, US envoy Richard Holbrooke appears to have made
little progress in bringing stability to Kosovo, where attacks on
ethnic Albanians have left tens of thousands of people homeless as
winter nears. State Department officials said Tuesday that it
appears increasingly likely that NATO will authorize military
strikes to stem the violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under normal circumstances, the commitment of American troops
is a full-time job for a president,'' said Marshall Wittman, the
director of congressional relations at the Heritage Foundation.
``These are extraordinary times.''
</P>
<P>
   As these crises unwind, Clinton is staring into the abyss of the
first full-fledged impeachment inquiry since Richard M. Nixon
resigned his office in 1974. The president, as well as Hillary
Rodham Clinton, are known still to be making telephone calls to key
legislators on his behalf. He has recently hired new staff to help
his cause on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Some Clinton allies dismissed any notion that sound US policy
decisions are imperiled by Clinton's predicament, and said it is
the Republican congressional leadership and the news media who have
become obsessed by the Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kosovo is a serious problem that has nothing to do with
American politics,'' said Representative Barney Frank, a
Massachusetts Democrat. ``You have an alliance locked into use of
force.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the economic situation, our ability is not being held up,''
Frank added. ``The rest of the world does not think less of the
president.''
</P>
<P>
   Others said Clinton is now doing what he has so often done in
the past: redoubling his attention to policy issues when confronted
with personal problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is characteristic of him to bear down on his work when he's
beleaguered,'' said Marshall, of the Democratic Leadership Council.
</P>
<P>
   Others assessed blame on the Congress, which has devoted much of
its attention to the Lewinsky affair. Still other analysts said
there is a void of leadership in Washington _ filled by political
gamesmanship.
</P>
<P>
   ``We seem to have lost control of the events,'' said Joe Silbey,
a presidential scholar at Cornell University. ``This week, and
these days, are tough, really tough. It calls for all kinds of
statesmanship, and no one wants to work together.''

 USERS OF THE POPULAR iMAC COPE WITH SOME GLITCHES  
 By MATT BEER   
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The computing world is finding out the hard way
that Apple Computer Inc.'s iMac may be popular but not perfect.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest problems with the aquamarine computer is its
lack of a floppy disk drive. Apple has tried to quell critics by
promoting a third-party device that was engineered specifically for
the iMac: the SuperDisk made by Imation. But there are fundamental
problems with that drive: It will not easily install programs from
floppy disks, and it will not install disk-based programs that are
copy protected. Apple and Imation blame each other for the problem.
</P>
<P>
   The disk drive is just out on the market, so users of the iMac
may not yet be aware of the problems.
</P>
<P>
   Since its debut Aug. 15, the iMac has become the
second-best-selling consumer computer in the United States. PC Data
Inc., a Reston, Va.-based market analysis firm, reports that the
futuristic machine accounted for 7.1 percent of retail computer
sales in August, lagging only behind Hewlett-Packard's 6330 desktop
line.
</P>
<P>
   Industry observers have criticized the iMac for its lack of a
traditional floppy-disk drive and standard connections for
printers, scanners and other devices.
</P>
<P>
   ``In trying to come out with cutting-edge technology, Apple has
ignored the real-world needs of their existing customers,'' said
Tom Rhinelander, an analyst with Forrester Research, a technology
research firm in Cambridge, Mass. ``It's that typical Apple way,
which has been Apple arrogance.''
</P>
<P>
   The iMac connects to other devices via a plug called a universal
serial bus, or USB. The USB is impressive. Developed by Intel, the
USB creates a high-speed connection at least 10 times faster than
the traditional printer port on older Macs. The USB device also
allows a user to chain together more than 120 devices on one port.
</P>
<P>
   So far, there are only a handful of iMac-compatible USB devices
on the market, in part because computer owners already have
traditionally configured printers and other peripherals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most iMac buyers already own older Macintoshes,'' Rhinelander
said. ``And they already have printers and scanners and such that
use the older connections.''
</P>
<P>
   The iMac does feature a CD-ROM drive. Most popular Mac software
programs are now published on CDs. But CDs are a permanent one-time
record media and can't be used to transfer data. Most common
software packages are now published on CDs. Specialized software
and older versions of popular programs are still published on
floppies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The floppy disk is still the overwhelming choice to transfer
data, especially in the consumer market,'' said Jason Thunstrom, a
spokesman for Imation, an Oakdale, Minn., manufacturer of data
storage devices. ``Last year, 4 billion disks were bought around
the world. That should tell you something.''
</P>
<P>
   The lack of a floppy has been a ``big issue with users,'' said
Ric Ford, who publishes MacInTouch (www.macintouch.com), an iMac
user Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Ford said some iMac owners had been taking radical steps to
solve the problem: Cracking open the iMac's translucent shell and
soldering in an older Macintosh floppy drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think that would void the warranty,'' Ford said. ``So I
don't recommend it.''
</P>
<P>
   Apple has said it did not include a disk drive on the iMac
because _ in the age of CDs and Internet software _ the technology
is outdated.
</P>
<P>
   Apple has publicized strategies for iMac users to get around
this problem: mainly attaching files to e-mail or connecting an
iMac to a network.
</P>
<P>
   The Cupertino, Calif., computer maker has also been touting a
new iMac-specific USB floppy drive released earlier this month by
Imation. The SuperDisk is being promoted as the solution to the
iMac floppy quandary. And, in fact, it does copy files to and from
an iMac's hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   But the SuperDisk, at $150, contains a major flaw: Imation
confirms that it won't easily install floppy disk programs into an
iMac. More disturbing to Mac software publishers, the SuperDisk
cannot install copy protected floppy disk programs. Copy protection
_ which keeps users from making bootleg reproductions of programs _
is the lifeblood of smaller software publishers.
</P>
<P>
   According to Imation, the problem stems from the Apple operating
system, which doesn't properly recognize the Imation drive or the
current copy protection codes. ``There's nothing on our end to
fix,'' Thunstrom said. ``The problem lies in the software that
Apple makes.''
</P>
<P>
   Thunstrom said the iMac won't send the command to automatically
spit out disks when installing software published on more than one
floppy. Multiple disk software is the norm in the industry.
Thunstrom said users must copy each disk onto the iMac's hard
drive, and then run the installation program from there. Disk-based
programs that contain the copy protection, Thunstrom said, simply
won't run.
</P>
<P>
   However, to get to this point, a consumer would have to first
try to install the disk-based program, figure out the problem, then
call Imation's help line, 800-888-2700. There is no documentation
included with the drive, or on Imation's Web site
(www.imation.com), which discusses the glitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been starting to get calls about it,'' said an Imation
technician. ``And we're getting more and more calls the longer the
drive's out there.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Copy protection software developers say Apple has been slow to
respond to the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very difficult to get (Apple's) attention,'' said Allen
Cronce, president of PACE Anti-Piracy, a leading floppy disk copy
protection software publisher based in San Jose. ``We eventually
had to go to Apple's headquarters ... but by that time, it was too
late,'' Cronce said. ``They were ready to roll with what they
had.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Shebanek, the USB product marketing manager at Apple, said
the problem lies in the software that Imation shipped with the
SuperDisk.
</P>
<P>
   Shebanek said Imation only worked with Apple on making a disk
drive that would copy files, not install programs from them. That
decision, he said, stemmed from Imation's desire to get the device
out as soon as possible after the iMac appeared.
</P>
<P>
   USB problems have also cropped up in the printer arena. Apple
has had to issue a software update to handle USB glitches affecting
printers, especially those advertised as being iMac-compatible from
Hewlett-Packard and Epson. Epson, in turn, has had to publish fixes
to its iMac printer software.
</P>
<P>
   The iMac's USB problems, Ford said, will eventually fade. ``The
companies that want to capture the emerging iMac market will start
publishing on CDs. It's not hard to do, and it's almost as
economical as floppies.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, added Ford, ``there is going to have to be some pain,
I guess.''

CAMPAIGN '98 ORBITS INTO CYBERSPACE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By ANDREW J. GLASS   
 c.1998 Cox News Service   
 &HT;    WASHINGTON _ As the November elections near, candidates are
planting their virtual battle flags in record numbers across
cyberspace.
 &HT;    While 1998 is the first election year in which the Internet is
widely regarded as a mass medium, it's still uncertain what impact
these powerful new digital tools will have on individual campaigns,
or more broadly, on the country's future political course.
 &HT;    ``This is really a test year for the Internet and politics and
we expect to learn a lot from this effort,'' Steve Case, chairman
and chief executive officer of America Online (AOL), said Tuesday
as he helped launch a major initiative to mesh the established
political world with the fluid World Wide Web.
 &HT;    Hosted by AOL, the new Web, White and Blue site
(http://www.webwhiteblue.org) offers one-stop political shopping to
some 45 major non-partisan political databases. The selected sites,
replete with their own clickable links, dispense voter information,
campaign schedules, issue papers and state-by-state political news.
 &HT;    Zoe Baird, president of the Markle Foundation, a co-sponsor of
the cyberproject, said 450 commercial Internet sites had so far
agreed to carry a Web, White and Blue icon on their own home pages.
 &HT;    As Case put it in a conference call with reporters: ``We're
giving people the tools and resources to do their own research _ to
learn about the candidates and issues and to connect with the
political process on their own terms and timetable.''
 &HT;    The candidates also seem to be getting the message.
 &HT;    A survey of candidates, key staff members and consultants in 270
current campaigns published last month in Campaigns &AMP; Elections
magazine last month found that nearly nine out of 10 respondents
saw the Internet as a vital medium that is changing, or soon will
change, political campaigns. Less than 12 percent voiced a
skeptical viewpoint.
 &HT;    The new explosive political demographics of the Internet became
evident last month when, within 24 hours, about 20 million
Americans accessed the impeachment report on President Clinton that
was referred to Congress by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr.
NetRatings, a cyberspace traffic measuring firm, found that each
online visitor spent an average of 30 minutes reviewing the report.
 &HT;    ``Just as television has all but eliminated observational
reporting, the Internet threatens interpretive and beat
reporting,'' said Michael Cornfield, who teaches courses on
politics and the new media here at George Washington University's
Graduate School of Political Management.
 &HT;    Cornfield, who also co-publishes an online political review,
noted that the advent of such massive document dumps puts extensive
source material for the first time directly in the public's hands.
 &HT;    As a result, he added, ``journalists are being forced to
accommodate to the Internet by devoting more of their efforts to
guiding their audiences into, and through, publicly relevant
documentation.
 &HT;    ``The public becomes an intimate part of the story itself, and
the dynamic and the role of the media changes from being mere
'reporters of fact' to 'guides to context'.''
 &HT;    
 &HT;    (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
 &HT;    
 &HT;    The sheer growth of cyberspace is another factor impacting the
political process.
 &HT;    In California, where the Internet has grown extensive roots, a
recent Field Poll shows that 41 percent of likely voters now use
e-mail and that 67 percent use a computer regularly at home, work
or school. Such high numbers offer largely unplowed soil for
political operatives.
 &HT;    A nationwide telephone survey conducted last February found that
the proportion of people who used the Internet for political
activity had doubled since a similar survey conducted before the
1996 elections.
 &HT;    But the growth path has a ways to go. According to Bruce Bimber,
a political science professor at the University of California,
Santa Barbara, who conducted the February poll, only 17 percent of
respondents used the Internet to express political views, to learn
about political issues, to browse for political information or to
get in contact with elected officials or candidates.
 &HT;    That is the kind of activity encouraged by Project Vote Smart, a
nonpartisan nonprofit group founded 40 years ago by former senators
and presidential candidates Barry Goldwater of Arizona and George
McGovern of South Dakota.
 &HT;    ``We're averaging more than a half million hits a day,'' said
Richard Kimball, the group's president. ``I fought against going on
the Internet three years ago,'' he added, ``but it's become huge
for us.''
 &HT;    No so huge, however, that the Internet stands a chance of
displacing television as the prime contact point for voters in the
near future.
 &HT;    Political consultants note that, unlike television, the Internet
is still not universally available and that online information
reaches only self-selected interested voters.
 &HT;    ``On TV, you decide you want to watch 'Seinfeld,' and you get
our ad,'' says Mark Mellman, a Washington political consultant
whose clients have included Democratic Sens. Tom Daschle of South
Dakota and Barbara Boxer of California. ``But when you go to the
Web, you have to want to go to a political site.''
 &HT;    Still, AOL's Case remains undeterred from his middleman function
of creating another viable ``portal for democracy.''
 &HT;    ``This is politics Internet-style: interactive, contextual,
informative, and, above all, optimistic,'' he concluded in touting
the new Web White &AMP; Blue site. ``While we cannot predict how the
Internet will change politics, we can say with certainty that it
will.''

<P>
   &UR;  &LR; TOKYO _ By 5 a.m., the world's biggest fish market is going
full throttle, alive with the noisy off-loading of 450 kinds of
seafood and the banter of thousands of wholesalers, middlemen and
restaurant owners.
</P>
<P>
   In the pre-dawn pallor, men in rubber galoshes creep through the
mist rising from endless rows of frozen tuna. It would be hard to
mistake these buyers, inspecting the three-foot carcasses with
metal prods and flashlights, for the high-flying bidders at an art
auction. But Japanese take their fish very seriously, and when the
beefy, tank-topped auctioneers call out bids at Tokyo Central
Wholesale Market, the stakes can be just as high as at Sotheby's.
</P>
<P>
   Or, at least, they used to be.
</P>
<P>
   As Japan muddles through its recession, even sushi, the ultimate
Japanese gastronomical obsession, is taking a bite.
</P>
<P>
   Next to rice, fish is perhaps Japan's most basic foodstuff, and
the decline in fish sales has paralleled the nation's economic
slump. Five years ago, the market sold $20.6 million of seafood
each day; this year sales dropped to $14.7 million. A single,
top-quality tuna to be served raw once commanded $20,000; on a
recent visit, the big earner was a 385-pound tuna for $8,346.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's economy has now contracted for three straight quarters,
and in this climate of anxiety, all but the wealthiest Japanese are
now saving instead of spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the worst I've seen in 40 years in this business,''
said Makoto Ishida, managing director of Tohto Suisan Co. Ltd., an
auction house at the market.
</P>
<P>
   Today, compared with the height of the bubble economy 10 years
ago, ``price and volume is about 30 to 40 percent down,'' he
estimated.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan's halcyon days of the 1980s, many people splurged on
the finest delicacies; the most conspicuous consumers sprinkled
gold leaf on their sushi before eating it. Today, while Japanese
staunchly resist cutting sushi out of their diets, many are looking
for ways to adjust their appetites.
</P>
<P>
   ``During this recession, many people are downsizing their
eating, cutting back or eating cheaper sushi,'' said Hirotoshi
Kosode, a senior auctioneer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cheaper fish is selling more, more expensive fish is selling
less, and some shops are selling cheaper fish, but charging the
same,'' he said darkly.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, cut-rate sushi bars are booming, stealing business
from moderate establishments by catering to gourmands adapting to
leaner times. Chefs at the priciest ``sushiyas,'' meanwhile, are
guarding clientele by maintaining top quality, and confide
gratefully that not everyone has run out of money.
</P>
<P>
   But for most people, lower-quality sushi at ``rotation''
restaurants, where customers serve themselves from a conveyor belt
and pay by the number of plates, has a new appeal. Many snubbed
those restaurants in the profligate 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Another approach is the all-you-can-eat philosophy, promoted by
the Edokko Zushi chain of restaurants, which offers enormous
portions of high-quality fish at low prices. In a no-frills
environment, Edokko profits from high volume by moving customers
through fast and limiting drinks.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Japanese people, sushi is very traditional and very
important compared to any other food. So even if normal people
can't get expensive stuff, we can still afford to buy cheap
sushi,'' Ishida said.
</P>
<P>
   Hirako Haruko, the owner of the medium-priced Kitahama sushi
bar, arrived early at the wholesale market so she could get the
best fish from middlemen. She said that the number of her customers
has dropped 30 percent since last year, and that each one eats less
than before.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't buy lower quality,'' she sniffed indignantly at the
suggestion that she economize, saying its more important to
preserve the reputation of her 47-year-old family-run restaurant.
``I prefer that my salary is down.''
</P>
<P>
   Reputation and quality are the mainstays of high-end
restaurants, like Sushi Kyubey, whose outlet at the Hotel Okura has
served the rich and famous for years. Here, the cheapest fare is a
12-gram piece of octopus sashimi for $2.30, while the dearest is a
tiny, mouth-melting morsel of fatty tuna belly &UR;  &LR; for $11.50. Dinner
for one costs about $150 without drinks.
</P>
<P>
   Head chef Makoto Shigihara says the price reflects not only the
highest-quality fish _ a slab of the best tuna breast costs the
restaurant $300 to $600 _ but also stringent quality control, with
two shifts of workers cutting, feeling and tasting the fish, and
sending it back if it's not the finest.
</P>
<P>
   Shigihara admits his is a ``high-society'' restaurant that has
catered to prime ministers and visiting dignitaries, including
President Clinton, who the chef recalls favored maguro tuna and
steamed abalone. But he said that instead of ``expecting customers
to just shut up and eat it ... we make sure the customer is
satisfied.''
</P>
<P>
   So Shigihara says he buys the best fish in town. He says some
regulars stayed away for a few months to try cheaper locales, but
many are back, because ``once you get used to sushi that suits your
tongue, it's very difficult to adjust your tastebuds just because
of price.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sushi is practical and there's no waste,'' Shigihara said.
``You order what you want to eat, you eat everything you order, and
you pay for what you eat. It suits the Japanese lifestyle. That's
why maybe not every sushi restaurant is doing well, but ours still
is.''

START-UP PC MAKER iDot BUILDS ON THE MADE-TO-ORDER MODEL 
By DWIGHT SILVERMAN  
c. 1998 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Start-up personal computer maker iDot.com may be small.
</P>
<P>
   It may even be impossible to find a store that sells its
products.
</P>
<P>
   But in some ways it shares many similarities with the more
established PC companies.
</P>
<P>
   Like Compaq Computer Corp., iDot was conceived by technology
industry veterans who met in a restaurant, sketching out ideas on a
napkin. Like Dell Computer Corp., iDot sells its wares directly to
customers, rather than going through a reseller. And like Gateway,
iDot goes after home and small-business customers.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike Compaq, you can't buy iDot's computers in stores.
Unlike Dell and Gateway, iDot employs no workers in call centers to
take phone orders.
</P>
<P>
   If you want an iDot system, there's only one place to get one:
the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which started doing business on April 21, bills
itself as ``the first PC company built for the Web.'' By selling
only over the Internet, iDot hopes to wring maximum efficiency out
of the process of building and marketing personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like to think of it as a beneficial conspiracy theory,''
says Jeremy Mark Marlow, one of the co-founders of iDot and its
senior vice president of marketing. ``If our customers will support
this very efficient business model, then we can give them excellent
prices.''
</P>
<P>
   In this way, iDot is more like Amazon.com, the Web-only
bookseller, and CDNow, which pioneered the sale of music compact
discs online. Crucial to its business is the company's technology,
a sophisticated piece of software that lets its customers configure
and then purchase a PC.
</P>
<P>
   An order placed on iDot's Web site and paid for with a credit
card can be instantly approved electronically. Within minutes, the
invoice for a new PC rolls out of a small Lexmark printer in iDot's
parts room _ the first time a human touches the order in the
process.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site and electronic commerce software was written by
programmers hired by iDot after the company couldn't find software
that did all this automatically. The software runs on a half-dozen
PCs built by iDot and linked by a fast connection to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have the potential to be the next Dell. Or, they could be
gone from our experience in the next month,'' said Rob Enderle,
director of desktop and mobile technology at Giga Information
Group, a market research company in Norwell, Mass. ``But, they are
redefining what a low-cost PC manufacturer can be.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, iDot owes a lot to its larger Austin neighbor. Dell's
phenomenal success selling computers on the Web _ it has online
sales of $6 million a day _ has proven that people will buy PCs
over the Net. Founder Michael Dell has said he thinks his company
may have as much as 50 percent of its sales online by 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, Dell still relies heavily on sales personnel who
both take calls and solicit business over the phone. iDot's
founders hope to build a business without that expense.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Dell was started, phone sales were the next big thing,''
Enderle said. ``Michael Dell stepped in and created the direct
business model around these call centers. But the new model is the
Web, and it has an intrinsically lower cost over call centers, just
as call centers do over a sales force in the field.''
</P>
<P>
   The company also takes advantage of its Texas location. The same
parts and service suppliers that work for Dell and Compaq also have
deals with iDot. As a result, iDot can use the same just-in-time
inventory techniques _ in which parts are shipped by suppliers as
they are needed from nearby warehouses to the assembly floor _ as
the big guys.
</P>
<P>
   The company was started by a group of computer industry veterans
like Marlow, who had been working for Austin-based Power Computing,
one of the most successful makers of Macintosh clones. When Apple
Computer took action to shut down the clone makers, Marlow was
brought in because of his experience as an executive at AST
Research, which makes Windows-based systems. Power wanted to
convert to selling similar systems.
</P>
<P>
   But Power's attempts to remake itself fell apart, and Marlow
found himself unemployed. He talked to several Austin-area
companies, including Dell. He eventually hooked up with Neil
Bremner, a former executive of the direct PC seller CompuAdd, and
C.P. Lee, a Taiwanese entrepreneur. Lee also owns a company that
sells peripherals and monitors under the familiar name Digital
Research Technologies. (At the dawn of the personal computer
revolution, a company called Digital Research offered the early
CP/Moperating system for personal computers, as well as an MS-DOS
clone called DR-DOS.)
</P>
<P>
   One evening last November, the men were having dinner at an
Applebee's restaurant in the shadow of Dell's headquarters and
sketched out the plans for a Web-based company on a dinner napkin.
</P>
<P>
   Lee used his contacts to secure $3.5 million in seed money from
Mag Technologies, makers of the Mag Innovision line of computer
monitors, and iDot formally opened its doors in offices in north
Austin in January.
</P>
<P>
   The company has targeted three specific markets _ students,
gamers and small businesses. All three are considered to be
computer-savvy, which cuts down somewhat on technical support
calls, Marlow said. To hammer home just who iDot's customers are,
the company uses the slogan ``PCs for Smarties.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's as opposed to, `for Dummies,' '' said Marlow, referring
to the popular line of books aimed at computer novices.
</P>
<P>
   The gamer segment is its best so far, and the most profitable.
Marlow said 40 percent of gamer systems are state-of-the-art, going
out the door with 450-megahertz Pentium II processors, lots of
memory and big hard drives.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the company aims most of its marketing at this
group. iDot recently completed a tour of Texas college campuses _
including Rice University and the University of Houston _ where it
set up multiplayer game tournaments. Students could compete by
playing the popular Quake II game, and the winners from each
university will meet for a match of champions at iDot's offices
later this month.
</P>
<P>
   Fredrick Marckini, iDot's very first customer, is typical of the
kind of people the company is trying to reach. The Weston, Mass.,
Internet consultant bought a $2,300, 400-megahertz system on April
23, just two days after the site first went up.
</P>
<P>
   Marckini said he ``lives on the Web,'' and was impressed enough
by iDot's site to buy a computer from an unfamiliar company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their Web site said they were clearly a well-funded company.
It was nothing even a sophisticated developer could put together on
his own. They weren't going away tomorrow,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the first iDot computer sold arrived with a flaw.
Marckini said there was a ``hard-disk issue'' and he had to send
the machine back. It was returned fixed, he said, and he's been
pleased with it. He's since bought two monitors from iDot.
</P>
<P>
   Because it's going after technology-savvy buyers, it also
attracts affluent ones. About 78 percent of people pay by credit
card, the rest by purchase order or check. The high number of
credit-card sales means iDot has a steady flow of cash. Company
executives won't say how many PCs they've sold, only that they are
doing better than expected.
</P>
<P>
   The company has borrowed another page from Amazon.com, setting
up virtual storefronts on other companies' Web sites. Amazon.com
will pay a commission to a business if it generates sales of books
via a link back to Amazon. An oil company, for example, could tout
Amazon.com books on geology or the petrochemical industry in
exchange for a cut of the sales.
</P>
<P>
   In an early marketing coup, iDot set up one of these storefronts
on the home page for Dilbert, the popular United Media cartoon
character (www.dilbert.com). iDot is now the ``official computer''
for the Dilbert Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's perfect for us,'' said Marlow. ``Engineers love Dilbert,
and they're part of our market. Also, Dilbert represents the
underdog. We're an underdog.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's executives relish and encourage this image as an
underdog. They know they are in the shadow of computer-industry
giants like Dell on the Web. Thus, they have another slogan:
``Don't buy PCs made by billionaires,'' referring to Michael Dell's
net worth.
</P>
<P>
   Even their offices smack of an irreverent attitude. Visitors who
wait in a spartan lobby must sit on day-glo beanbag chairs _ and
there are only two. The decor is decidedly early '60s kitsch.
</P>
<P>
   That look is also part of iDot's emphasis on efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look for ways to cut costs everywhere,'' said co-founder
Bremner. ``We even look for deals on office supplies. When someone
goes for pencils, they don't just buy the first thing on the
shelf.''
</P>
<P>
   That efficiency pays off in aggressive pricing. An iDot system
with a 450-megahertz Pentium II chip, a 16.8-gigabyte hard drive,
128 megabytes of memory, a 56K fax modem, an 8-MB video card and a
DVD-ROM drive costs about $2,099. A similarly equipped Gateway
system, priced at that PC maker's Web site, sells for $2,326. A
comparable Dell system is $2,252. Monitors for each of these
systems are extra.
</P>
<P>
   So far, there are 50 employees at iDot, which had only four
employees when it began. Its executives plan to keep things tight _
Bremner expects there will be only about 100 employees a year from
now.
</P>
<P>
   He said the next step in the company's growth is to raise more
private capital, $10 million to $15 million, ``to get us through
the next two years, and at that point we'll be cash-flow
positive.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's executives realize that iDot's current niche won't
be enough to sustain it. Eventually it will have to begin offering
notebook computers and servers, and begin selling products to the
more lucrative corporate market.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, iDot begins seriously competing with Dell,
Compaq, IBM and other major players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, there are some very large, behemoth vendors like
Dell and Gateway out there, and iDot operates under their radars at
this point,'' said Bruce Stephen, head of personal systems research
at International Data Corp. in Framingham, Mass. ``They are in the
fun part now, the start-up phase.'' &QL;

FRENCH TELECOM IN INTERNET PROJECT FOR TECHNOPHOBES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ France Telecom, which pioneered the quirky
Minitel online information service years before anyone ever heard
of the World Wide Web, announced plans Wednesday to bring its aging
child into the modern world.
</P>
<P>
   Working with IBM Corp., the French telephone company said it
would develop a network to let customers surf the Internet with
simple and cheap screen-based telephones, which would also be
inexpensive.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes according to plan, the new devices would give
technophobic customers access to the Internet without using a more
complex personal computer. Though the Minitel system would continue
to exist, with its homely little terminals and its proprietary
network, the company hopes many people will simply gravitate to the
newer system and its allure of worldwide access.
</P>
<P>
   IBM is supposed to deliver a prototype networking system by the
end of this year, and France Telecom officials hope to start
commercial service by the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Minitel, which was begun 15 years ago by the French government,
was one of the first online consumer information services.
Conceived as a way to bring advanced communications to ordinary
people, the Minitel came before personal computers had Windows,
before America Online and long before the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   And when the World Wide Web exploded in popularity, allowing
people to flit to computers around the world with a few mouse
clicks, the Minitel remained almost obstinately old-fashioned. It
remains slow, has no graphics and offers access to little outside
France. But it remains popular in its home country, where it has
about 15 million users and is host to about 25,000 services.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the end of Minitel, but we have to prepare for the
future,'' said Jean-Jacques Damlamlin, vice president for
development at France Telecom. ``Some people are not willing to use
PCs for electronic commerce, but they are willing to see us provide
a substitute for their Minitels.''
</P>
<P>
   Minitel may be slow and dull to watch, but it is simple, cheap
and free from hackers. It generates billions of francs worth of
fees from electronic commerce, from train reservations to flower
deliveries.
</P>
<P>
   Old-fashioned or not, political leaders and many industry
experts worry that Minitel's enduring popularity has held back the
Internet in France. In a speech in August 1997, Prime Minister
Lionel Jospin startled many people by suggesting just that.
Minitel, he said, ``could be hindering the development of new and
promising applications of information technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement announced Wednesday, IBM is to develop a new
networking platform that connects a new generation of Internet
devices. Unlike most other Internet access providers, France
Telecom would take responsibility for maintaining and upgrading the
software on individual terminals. Most of the management and
navigational information, including profiles of users and their
bookmarks of favorite Web sites, would be held within the telephone
company's network rather than in the terminals.
</P>
<P>
   But France Telecom executives, who refused to say how much money
would go into the new contract, acknowledged there were many
uncertainties. The biggest is whether the new screen-based
telephones will be cheap enough to attract customers. With computer
prices low and falling, company executives say they still do not
know for certain whether the new devices have enough price
advantage to be economically viable.
</P>
<P>
   Though IBM, which is based in Armonk, N.Y., is developing the
networking system, France Telecom wants other companies to build
the terminals. Company officials say they want to encourage a wide
array of equipment manufacturers, and that one of the reasons they
chose IBM was that the American computer giant has very little
interest in building terminals. ``We want the system to be
completely open,'' Damlamlin said.

MIT HELPS OKLAHOMA-PROOF A MEMORIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Designers of a memorial to the 168 victims of the April 1995
Oklahoma City terror bombing are turning to Massachusetts Institute
of Technology ceramics specialists for help meshing their plans
with Oklahoma's volatile weather.
</P>
<P>
   When it opens about 18 months from now, the centerpiece of a
memorial to the victims of the truck bomb attack on the Alfred P.
Murrah Federal Building will be an array of 168 glass and bronze
chairs on a grassy plain where the building stood. They will
overlook a reflecting pool, playground, and a lone ``survivor
tree'' that miraculously endured the blast.
</P>
<P>
   However, the aesthetic vision of memorial designers Torrey and
Hans Butzer, who work out of Cambridge, has run up against a vexing
physical fact: Oklahoma is prone to 115-degree summer days with
sudden, chilly thunderstorms that, MIT tests showed, could crack
the chairs.
</P>
<P>
   With help from Yet-Ming Chiang, an MIT professor of materials
science and engineering, the Butzers and colleague Sven Berg have
been testing samples of various types of glass to see whether they
could withstand the sudden temperature drops _ called ``thermal
shock'' _ likely to occur in Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was delighted to be able to work on this,'' Chiang said last
week. ``It's quite different from much of the other work we do
around here, and I think it's a stunning design. I can see why it
would appeal so much to all the victims' families.''
</P>
<P>
   The chairs will feature brass seats mounted on lit glass blocks,
conveying a sense of floating, with the name of a victim etched on
each one and smaller chairs representing the 19 toddlers and
children killed there. A groundbreaking on the $24.1 million
project is set for Oct. 25.
</P>
<P>
   Last April, the Butzers called MIT seeking suggestions for a
specialist to help advise them on choosing materials for the
memorial.
</P>
<P>
   Laboratory tests conducted this spring by Chiang and one of his
graduate students, Benjamin Hellweg, found that the artists' first
choice for glass would be subject to cracking under a 59-degree
temperature change _ not implausible on a summer Oklahoma day when
the chairs might reach 120 degrees and get sprayed by 60-degree
rain.
</P>
<P>
   Since late July, two sample chairs have been sitting on top of
MIT's Building 13, already showing the development of some cracks
from exposure to heat and rain.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the artists have gone back to two industrial glass
companies, Corning and Lancaster, to find a different glass that
could withstand dramatic temperature changes but could still be
worked in their casting furnaces. Later this autumn, samples are to
be sent to MIT for more tests.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Chiang has advised the artists to cast several extra
replacement chairs, given the statistical near-certainty that no
matter how well crafted, some of the chairs are likely to develop
cracks from exposure to weather.
</P>
<P>
   ``The work that MIT has been doing has been real, real
critical,'' said Kari Ferguson, communications director for the
Oklahoma City National Memorial Trust. ``It will help us perfect
the glass so that we don't have problems later on.''
</P>
<P>
   Each glass chair base _ a cube made of 2-inch-thick panels _
will be cast separately with its own unique swirl of bubbles and
ripples, Ferguson said, symbolizing ``the individuality of every
life'' that was lost.

VIKINGS THE TEAM TO BEAT

<TEXT>
<P>
   It is not a stretch to say this morning that the Minnesota
Vikings could be the best team in the National Football League.
</P>
<P>
   The Denver Broncos might disagree, but not even they, with their
offensive brilliance, have gone undefeated through the exhibition
games and regular season, and done the near-impossible by spanking
the Packers in Green Bay on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you consider all of the parameters,'' says Vikings
offensive coordinator Brian Billick, ``in Green Bay ... Lambeau
Field ... the Packer crowd ... Monday night football ... undefeated
... No. 1-ranked defense in the league ... you have to say this was
a great victory. A very important win for our team.''
</P>
<P>
   Fritz Shurmur has been in the NFL for more than two decades.
When he was defensive coordinator for the Los Angeles Rams in the
1980s, he had to go up against the fabulous San Francisco 49ers
offense twice a year. Joe Montana, Jerry Rice, John Taylor, Roger
Craig, and that bunch. When he moved to Arizona to run the
Cardinals defense, he caught the three-time world champion Dallas
Cowboys twice a year, with Troy Aikman, Emmitt Smith, Michael
Irvin, Jay Novacek, et al.

   But, as best he could recall, Shurmur never remembered taking a
beating like the one he got from the Vikings in their spectacular
37-24 victory in a driving rain Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do have selective memory,'' said Shurmur, trying
unsuccessfully to chuckle, ``but I never remember getting involved
with something like this. This team is dangerous. As dangerous as I
have ever seen. They can do some things that I haven't ever seen
any other team do. This team has an offense that can make you
spread out on defense more than any team I have seen. They make you
defend the whole field, and that is not easy to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Both teams were undefeated going into the game, but everyone _
except the Vikings _ thought Green Bay was going to win. Though
Minnesota plays them better than any other team in the NFC Central,
the Packers always seem to win out at the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have played them so many times,'' says Billick, ``that we
know just how good they can be on defense. Fritz Shurmur, to me, is
the best defensive coordinator in the game. Reggie White this year
has been playing better than he has in years. In this league, there
are certain guys _ our own John Randle, Bruce Smith, and Reggie _
that you have to make sure you have two men available to block
them. They are that good. We took that into account in this game.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``new'' Randall Cunningham and his incomparable corps of
wide receivers _ Cris Carter, Jake Reed, and blossoming superman
Randy Moss _ obliterated the Packer secondary for 442 passing yards
and four touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did all of that,'' says Shurmur, ``and we didn't have a
single blown coverage. They just made all of the plays, and our
guys didn't. We didn't play very well, but the guys we were playing
against had something to do with that.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they put those three wide receivers out, you have to
worry about matchups more than you want to. Whether you use a
nickel or dime, it doesn't make any difference. All of them are
tough matchups.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we used to go against San Francisco, they had two running
backs in there. Dallas was the same. It's a smaller field to defend
when the other team has two running backs on the field. These guys
use one back and three wides. To go with that, they have the best
offensive line in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been building to this for two or three years. We
couldn't get near Cunningham all night. He just sat in the pocket
and made throws. He didn't used to do that. He wanted to run
around, and you can't throw the deep balls with accuracy, like he
did in this game, running around.''
</P>
<P>
   This Cunningham is not the quarterback who couldn't throw
straight with the Eagles, or the one no one wanted when he quit to
go on television three seasons ago. But after being revitalized by
Minnesota coach Dennis Green, who needed another quarterback after
Warren Moon went to Seattle, Cunningham is playing better than
ever.
</P>
<P>
   Coming into this season as the backup for Brad Johnson,
Cunningham's personal quarterback rating for his career stood at
78.4. Anything under 80.0 is not considered good.
</P>
<P>
   This morning, he has a phenomenal 127.8 rating, best in the
league. In the last two games, he has eight touchdown passes, 717
yards, and zero interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last three games he has not run the ball once,'' says
Billick. ``Before (Monday's) game, I told him _ half-kidding but
half-serious _ to run the ball when he had the opening. He never
ran it once all game. Our offensive line did a tremendous job of
protecting him. I think he got knocked down once all night and that
was on a blitz.''
</P>
<P>
   As good as Cunningham has been, what sets this Viking team apart
are its wide receivers: Carter, Reid, Moss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moss is the guy that makes them different,'' says Patriots
head coach Pete Carroll, who got a taste of how good the Vikings
are when they whacked his team, 28-0, in Foxborough during the
exhibition season. ``We had only played five or six plays in that
game, and I said to myself, `Hey, this kid really is special.' I
don't know for sure exactly what made me think it, but I remember
telling our guys at the half that we better pay special attention
to Moss because I was so impressed. Then he still went out and
caught a bomb for a touchdown on us.''
</P>
<P>
   If you have followed pro football for any length of time and
watched Moss perform vs. Green Bay, you had to come away feeling
that this was the beginning of a likely Hall of Fame career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moss has a knack of just going right over the defender and
catching the ball that is special,'' says Carroll. ``I talked with
Foge Fazio (the Vikings defensive coordinator and a friend of
Carroll's) and he told me Moss does it all the time in practice to
their defensive backs. They have him covered. He makes the catch.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been around an athlete like Randy Moss,'' says
Billick. ``He can make plays that seem impossible. Don't forget, he
also had an 80-yarder for a touchdown called back in that game, and
another time he was open for a long touchdown and the wind gave the
ball a push and it was just out of his reach.''
</P>
<P>
   Seldom does a team go after another in the NFL the way the
Vikings invaded Green Bay Monday night. In terrible weather, which
usually leads teams to play conservatively, they went for all of it
all night long.
</P>
<P>
   ``We told our offensive guys we were going to go vertical all
night,'' says Billick. ``We wanted to spread them out and hit them
deep. You can't do that unless your offensive line gives you time.
We let our guys know that. We needed more time. We had two guys on
Reggie at times, and used tight ends and backs to chip away. But,
when they blitzed, we had to take him man to man and Korey Stringer
did a good job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Randall was patient. He held the ball and waited to make the
plays. When he put the ball out there, our guys went up and got it.
Our receivers are bigger than their defensive backs. We wanted big
plays. We felt their offense was going to score points, and we
couldn't match them by stringing together long drives of 12-14
plays. Our strategy was to hit them down the field. Eventually,
teams are going to back off, and when they do, our running game is
going to get better than it has been, and it hasn't been bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota's next game is against Washington a week from Sunday.
The Redskins are last in the league on defense, giving up 33.8
points per game.

SCANDAL TAKES A BACK SEAT ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALLENTOWN, Pa. _ William Heydt, the Republican mayor of this old
steel town, remains amazed at his city's subdued reaction to
President Clinton's relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky. ``If I as
mayor put my hand on somebody's shoulder, I'd be run out of town on
a rail,'' he said, decrying the lack of outrage.
</P>
<P>
   If any congressional district in America should be affected by
the Clinton-Lewinsky story, it is Lehigh Valley, a socially
conservative area where Democrats narrowly outnumber Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The district's retiring congressman, Representative Paul McHale,
became the first Democrat in Congress to call for Clinton's
resignation. The dominant newspaper, the Morning Call,
wholeheartedly agreed with McHale, publishing an editorial
headlined: ``Disgraced President Must Resign.''
</P>
<P>
   But the candidates to succeed McHale believe that the voters of
Pennsylvania's 15th congressional district _ like many across the
country, according to the polls _ aren't nearly as concerned about
what happened in the back corridors of the White House as they are
about what is happening in their own back yard.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the candidates hoping to succeed McHale are striving to
ignore the scandal. Neither has echoed McHale's call for Clinton's
resignation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't think there is going to be an effect at all,''
said Roy C. Afflerbach, the Democratic state senator seeking the
seat. Indeed, when a Democratic congressional candidate from a
neighboring district made headlines by refusing to go to a
Philadelphia fund-raiser with Clinton on Friday night, Afflerbach
promptly accepted an invitation and attended.
</P>
<P>
   Afflerbach's Republican opponent, Patrick Toomey, also has no
interest in making the president's conduct an issue. He said he is
``seldom'' asked about the Clinton scandal, and he would rather
talk about his plan to cut taxes.
</P>
<P>
   All of this is important far beyond the rolling landscape of the
15th district, which analysts consider a ``swing'' area that is one
of the best indicators of the national mood. With the House likely
to vote on articles of impeachment after the November election, the
makeup of the House is vitally important to the president's future.
The election or defeat of a few Democrats such as Afflerbach could
determine whether Clinton is impeached.
</P>
<P>
   To understand what is happening here, residents point to the
words of pop singer Billy Joel, who memorialized this region's long
decline in his hit song, ``Allentown'': Well, we're living here in
Allentown, and they're closing all the factories down. Now, while
some Bethlehem Steel and Mack Truck are bare shells or their former
presence, the region seems to grow industrial parks like topsy. The
district has a low unemployment rate of 4.3 percent. Clinton gets a
healthy share of the credit for this unsung sequel, similar to the
way the economic uplift has benefited the president across the
country. Still, the departure of union members and influx of
entrepeneurs is making the region more Republican.
</P>
<P>
   So when Afflerbach and Toomey go campaigning, they hear more
about the economy than Lewinsky. On Friday, for example, Toomey, an
earnest 36-year-old who owns two sports-themed restaurants called
``Rookies,'' knocked on doors in a townhouse subdivision that
stradled a highway humming with traffic.
</P>
<P>
   The first resident that Toomey met, Deborah Trucksess, an
Independent, seemed happy to meet the Republican candidate and
pledged to vote for him. Asked by a reporter if the Clinton scandal
concerned her, she said: ``Not at all.''
</P>
<P>
   But a little later, Toomey ran into Susan Bilder, an elementary
school teacher who bluntly told Toomey that she couldn't vote for
him. Toomey inquired whether she had studied the individual
candidates in the race. Bilder replied that it made no difference.
As Bilder subsequently explained, she is so angry at Republicans
for the investigation of Clinton that she plans to vote for
Democratic candidates down the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not his fault,'' Bilder said, motioning to Toomey.
Moreover, Bilder added that the Allentown economy has recovered and
``my children are all doing well.'' So Afflerbach has her vote.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the most crucial voter that Toomey met on his regular
door-knocking venture may have been another Democrat down the
street. She explained that she would back the Democrat, but she
didn't plan to vote. Toomey's private polls show that Republicans
will turn out in good numbers while many Democrats _ perhaps
depressed by the Clinton scandal _ will stay home. It is pattern
repeated in polls across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, an ABC-TV News poll released last week contained some
possibly misleading good news for Democrats. It showed that
Democratcs are pulling ahead in the national ``generic'' vote for
congressional candidates. The poll found that registered voters
favored Democratic candidates over Republicans by 49 to 44 percent.
But when pollsters put the same question to likely voters, the
results were reversed, with Republican candidates favored by 49
percent to 46 percent. While these results were close to the poll's
3.5 percent margin of error, they are in line with the predictions
of many analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the poll found that 71 percent of those surveyed
approved of the job being done by their representative in Congress,
a good sign for the Republican-held House.
</P>
<P>
   All of this has led to wildly conflicting predictions about the
outcome of the Nov. 3 election. In interviews last week, several of
the nation's most seasoned political analysts said it was most
difficult and unpredictable midterm election they have ever seen.
Predictions range from a Republican walkover, in which the GOP
would ascend to historic majorities in the House and Senate, to a
anti-Republican backlash, in which the Democratic would regain
power at least in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some of the most respected analysts agreed that Clinton
scandal hasn't hurt Democratic candidates quite as they thought
after Clinton made a poorly received speech to nation on Aug. 17 in
which he failed to apologize for his relationship with the former
White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the landscape had shifted after the Aug. 17
speech,'' said political analysts Stuart Rothenberg. ``But we never
really saw the shift working its way through the country. Now I am
starting to wonder if there really was a shift. I just don't think
there is a big shift.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Cook, another top observer of congressional races, still
thinks Democrats would be better off if Clinton resigns. But Cook
said that he has looked at every race in the nation and has found
little shift due to the Clinton scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could say if you went from Alabama to Wyoming, you would
come up with virtually no change,'' Cook said.
</P>
<P>
   But that is not necessarily good news for Democrats. Rothenberg
and Cook agreed that Republicans are almost certain to maintain
their control of the House and Senate.
</P>
<P>
   In the House, controlled 228-206 by Republicans, several
analysts have scaled back their predictions of a 25-seat pickup by
the GOP, but still expect a 10 to 15 seat gain.
</P>
<P>
   Even Democratic Party officials, aware that the party
controlling the White House sometimes loses 35 seats in an off-year
election, are not predicting that they can win back the House. But
Democratic officials are hoping to win enough seats to make it more
difficult to impeach the president. Republicans would need only a
one-vote margin of victory to approve articles of impeachment in
the Clinton case.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, controlled 55-45 by the GOP, Republicans could
pick up from three to seven seats. A seven-seat gain, for example,
would give the GOP a 62-seat majority, still five short of the
two-thirds vote needed to convict a president in an impeachment if
all 100 senators cast their ballot.

WASHINGTON MUTUAL TO CLOSE BRANCHES, CUT JOBS IN CALIFORNIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WENDY TANAKA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Washington Mutual Inc., the nation's largest
savings and loan, is planning to close 161 branch offices in
California and lay off between 3,000 and 3,500 workers throughout
the state by next spring.
</P>
<P>
   The move results from the Seattle-based thrift's $6.9 billion
acquisition of H.F. Ahmanson &AMP; Co., the parent of Home Savings of
America. Banking officials said they needed to eliminate duplicate
operations from the merger, which was completed last week.
</P>
<P>
   Tim McGarry, a spokesman for Washington Mutual, said the
heaviest job cuts would likely occur in the Los Angeles area
because the largest number of office closings, 40, are slated for
that region. The thrift plans to close 22 offices in San Diego, 21
in Orange County and seven offices in Alameda County.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that we've identified which branches are consolidating,
branch and regional managers will have to sit down and determine
branch needs,'' McGarry said after the plans were announced
Tuesday. ``Until the consolidations go through, we'll have normal
attrition, which is relevant to the number of people we'll have to
lay off.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the process is completed in next year's second quarter,
we will have a highly efficient and effective network in
California, with 541 branch locations and more than 1,400 ATMs,''
Deanna Oppenheimer, a Washington Mutual spokeswoman, said in a
prepared statement.
</P>
<P>
   Washington Mutual said the consolidations would happen where
branch offices of the two banks are within a few miles of each
other.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it is in consumers' interest,'' said Linda
Sherry, spokeswoman for Consumer Action, a San Francisco-based
watchdog group. ``It means fewer and fewer branches in
neighborhoods. People will have to go out of their way to find an
ATM machine'' where they won't have to pay a fee for withdrawing
cash.
</P>
<P>
   But Sherry noted that Washington Mutual has attempted to
position itself as a consumer-friendly bank with its humorous TV
ads that started airing in July.
</P>
<P>
   ``Washington Mutual is trying to be a buddy bank,'' said Sherry,
referring to the bank's whimsical ads that portray bank tellers as
sought-after celebrities. ``It doesn't help to close more and more
branches in neighborhoods.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the bank took a whimsical advertising approach to
start building name recognition in a geographic territory dominated
by BankAmerica Corp. and Wells Fargo Bank.

TO VOTERS, TAX ISSUE MAY NOT BE THE KEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOT LEHIGH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Forget death and taxes. In modern politics, it's
considered a near certainty that taxes mean death to political
candidates. &UR;  &LR; Raising taxes, that is.
</P>
<P>
   But that may be a simplistic view, despite attempts by
candidates in Massachusetts to make the fear of increased taxes an
election-year issue.
</P>
<P>
   Acting Governor Paul Cellucci used Democratic rival Scott
Harshbarger's refusal to sign a no-new-taxes pledge as a bludgeon
to batter his foe in Monday's gubernatorial debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you remember the last time we had a governor who wouldn't
take the no-new-taxes pledge?'' Cellucci asked. ``It was a
disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   That was a reference to 1989 and 1990, when former governor
Michael S. Dukakis won tax increases to stanch budgets hemorrhaging
in the recession.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Harshbarger, who noted that his first campaign proposal
had been a call for a large tax cut, called Cellucci's pledge ploy
``stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   Harshbarger said Cellucci's own legislative record, which
includes several votes for a higher gas tax and a Boston parking
tax, as well as votes to continue cigarette and alcohol levies,
belies his tough anti-tax rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never voted for a tax increase, unlike Paul Cellucci, who
voted for hundreds of millions of dollars in tax increases while he
was in the Legislature, then changed his position when he ran for
statewide office,'' said Harshbarger. ``So the pledges he asked you
to support are not worth the paper they are written on.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Rob Gray, Cellucci's campaign manager, said Cellucci had
proved his anti-tax bona fides over the last eight years, and
insisted the no-new-tax pledge is a legitimate issue, even in an
era of dueling tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a way of telling the difference between the two
candidates,'' Gray insisted. ``It makes clear to people that Paul
Cellucci is tough on taxes and Scott Harshbarger would be a
governor who would not be tough on taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Harshbarger considers such a pledge an abdication of
leadership, others argue that drawing a public line in the sand
actually strengthens a governor's hand in negotiating with the
Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ``It became the cornerstone of much of the fiscal and economic
success in Massachusetts over the last eight years because
everybody knew that raising taxes was off the table,'' said
Republican consultant Charles Manning.
</P>
<P>
   Reinforced by that pledge, former governor Bill Weld forced the
Legislature to cut spending to balance the budget.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as Harshbarger argues, other programs _ even programs
that Cellucci cites on the campaign trail _ would have been
impossible without some of the narrow tax hikes approved by voters
or the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are proud of having health care for kids, how do you
justify vetoing the (1996) tobacco tax,'' which funds some of that
care? Harshbarger asked. ``How in good conscience can you talk to
the business community and tell them to watch out for this risky
guy when you vetoed the convention center (legislation) simply
because it raises fees on tourists?''
</P>
<P>
   Although tax-and-spending charges occupied much of Cellucci's
time during Monday's debate, the most recent Boston Globe poll,
taken in August, suggests that the tax issue _ let alone anti-tax
pledges _ isn't as potent with Massachusetts voters as Cellucci
apparently believes.
</P>
<P>
   The Globe survey found that while taxes is the issue most often
cited by likely Republican primary voters, it ranked only third
with likely Democratic voters. And in neither group did the issue
command anything approaching a majority: 24 percent of GOP voters _
which represents less than 5 percent of the total registered voters
in the state _ said taxes mattered most, compared to 13 percent of
Democrats who thought so.
</P>
<P>
   Even during the voter rage in recessionary 1990, the year in
which Weld established a no-new-taxes pledge as the cornerstone of
GOP election strategy, taxes hardly rocketed off the charts as an
issue, despite two straight years of tax increases.
</P>
<P>
   In August of 1990, a Globe poll found that 19 percent of all
voters cited taxes as their most important issue, followed by 18
percent who said education, and 16 percent who cited the economy.
</P>
<P>
   History also tells a much more complex story on both taxes and
anti-tax promises. In 1964, John Volpe, the Republican candidate
for governor, ran as an open advocate of a 3 percent sales tax,
which, he said, would allow the state to lessen the burden of
property taxes. Once elected, Volpe led a long battle for the sales
tax. Each time one version was voted down, Volpe proposed another.
Finally, in March of 1966, after months of vehement opposition,
lawmakers passed the tax. Volpe was handily re-elected that same
year.
</P>
<P>
   Running for governor in 1974 in the face of a growing budget
deficit, Michael Dukakis offered the so-called ``lead-pipe
guarantee'' that he would not raise taxes. But by November, Dukakis
had signed a $362 million tax package, including a 7.5 percent
surtax on the income tax.
</P>
<P>
   Dukakis lost the 1978 Democratic primary to conservative Edward
J. King, who hammered him on taxes, crime, and the death penalty.
But that loss has long been attributed as much to Dukakis's
wholesale alienation of the left, which was angry over
social-program cuts, as to the tax increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``He lost in the primary because the liberals stayed home,''
said David Bartley, then the Democratic speaker of the
Massachusetts House.
</P>
<P>
   On the national level, the most famous no-new-taxes pledge was
the ``read my lips'' promise George Bush offered in 1988 _ and
broke two years later.
</P>
<P>
   Reneging on his pledge hurt Bush's credibility, and gave
conservative challenger Patrick Buchanan an issue to embarrass Bush
with in the 1992 GOP primary. Still, Bush was again talking tax
cuts by the 1992 general election, while Bill Clinton, the man who
beat him, had staked out a dual position, proposing both a
middle-class tax cut and a plan to hike taxes on the wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Republican predictions of disaster, Clinton won passage
of much of his tax-increase plan, then cruised to a relatively easy
re-election in 1996 over Kansas Senator Bob Dole, who was promising
large tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   But in New Hampshire, when Democrat Jeanne Shaheen took an
anti-tax pledge in 1996, she clearly neutralized an issue that had
plagued her party's previous gubernatorial nominees for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``By taking the pledge, Jeanne Shaheen was able to take the
topic off the table and become the first woman governor of New
Hampshire and the first Democratic governor in ages,'' said
Democratic consultant Mary Anne Marsh.
</P>
<P>
   Just how the issue plays out in 1998 remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is especially effective in Massachusetts in the
1990s because people have the tax increases of the late 1980s fresh
in their minds,'' said Gray.
</P>
<P>
   But a new public-opinion poll by Opinion Dynamics shows that
Dukakis, whom Cellucci uses as a political Darth Vader, is now
viewed favorably by 51 percent of Massachusetts voters, with only
29 percent seeing him unfavorably.
</P>
<P>
   And, looking back from the perspective of four decades observing
Massachusetts politics, Bartley scoffed at the notion that voters
will flee from a candidate simply because he refuses to take an
anti-tax pledge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is certifiable nonsense,'' said Bartley. ``No one gets beat
by that rhetoric _ or even by raising taxes if people know they are
for going to schools ... or to clean up the environment. They have
consistently supported those taxes.''

MARIJUANA PRODUCT MAY AID IN TRAUMAS

<P>
   A drug modeled after a chemical found in marijuana could offer
hope to hundreds of thousands of victims of severe head trauma,
reducing the death rate and letting more of them resume a normal
life, according to a study that was to be unveiled Wednesday at an
international conference in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The findings are arousing substantial interest in part because
head injuries are the leading cause of death among young people in
America, and there are few if any treatments. And if these early
results are substantiated, the new drug _ called dexanabinol _
would be the most medically useful treatment derived from the
controversial cannabis plant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hugely exciting,'' said Dr. Brian Andrews, who chairs the
neurotrauma program of the American Association of Neurological
Surgeons, which is meeting in Seattle and was to hear a
presentation on the new drug. Dexanabinol, he added, appears to be
just the sort of treatment ``that we have been looking for for
years and years.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. William Beaver, professor emeritus of pharmacology at
Georgetown University School of Medicine, is even more upbeat:
``This kind of treatment, if it works, would have tremendous impact
on the treatment of neural injury and it could, of course, also be
of value in something like strokes.''
</P>
<P>
   The new drug also would be, ``beyond any doubt,'' the most
medically significant use ever made of marijuana, said Beaver, who
chaired a panel of experts assembled last year by the National
Institutes of Health to review possible medical uses of marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have been searching for 40 years for medicinal uses
of the more than 400 chemicals in the intoxicating marijuana plant,
which already is used to treat nausea and severe weight loss. While
interest waned in the 1980s, it has waxed again as researchers have
learned more about the mechanisms whereby the drug interacts with
receptors in the brain.
</P>
<P>
   Dexanabinol is one in a series of compounds manufactured in the
laboratory and modeled after chemicals found in marijuana.
Dexanabinol's founder, Professor Raphael Mechoulam of Hebrew
University in Jerusalem, sought to capture the neuroactive
properties of the marijuana chemical, but not the psychoactive ones
that induce a ``high.''
</P>
<P>
   Mechoulam licensed dexanabinol to Pharmos Corp., an
Israeli-based pharmaceutical firm, which has run two stages of
clinic trials. The first showed the drug was safe. The second,
results of which are being released today, showed it could be
remarkably effective.
</P>
<P>
   The mortality rate among the 30 head trauma patients who took
the drug was 10 percent, compared to 13.5 percent with 37 patients
getting a placebo. The incidence of low blood pressure, which can
worsen a patient's condition, also was significantly reduced in the
treated group (13 percent) versus placebos (38 percent). And, even
more encouraging, the drug accelerated recovery and let 50 percent
more patients resume a normal life six months after their injury.
</P>
<P>
   How does dexanabinol work? The original trauma not only kills
brain cells that were directly impacted, but it also generates the
release of chemicals that can kill or dangerously inflame
surrounding cells. Dexanabinol, which is given within six hours of
the injury, protects the brain in three different ways, explains
Anat Biegon, Pharmos' vice president for research and development.
The drug mops up some of the dangerous chemicals, forms a
protective barrier around at-risk brain cells, and limits
intracranial inflammation.
</P>
<P>
   Pharmos, which has just 45 employees, is looking for a bigger
partner to help it launch a last phase of clinical trials involving
as many as 900 patients worldwide. Those tests, which could begin
next year, would take about two years, predicted Pharmos chairman
Haim Aviv.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are about 370,000 eligible patients with head trauma in
the US, worldwide there are 700,000 to 800,000, and currently there
is not a single drug there for them,'' Avid added. ``We estimate
there are 10,000 lives that could be saved by this drug . . . and
it could mean 37,000 more patients who could go back to a normal
life.''

<P>
   &UR;  &LR; TOKYO _ By 5 a.m., the world's biggest fish market is going
full throttle, alive with the noisy off-loading of 450 kinds of
seafood and the banter of thousands of wholesalers, middlemen and
restaurant owners.
</P>
<P>
   In the pre-dawn pallor, men in rubber galoshes creep through the
mist rising from endless rows of frozen tuna. It would be hard to
mistake these buyers, inspecting the three-foot carcasses with
metal prods and flashlights, for the high-flying bidders at an art
auction. But Japanese take their fish very seriously, and when the
beefy, tank-topped auctioneers call out bids at Tokyo Central
Wholesale Market, the stakes can be just as high as at Sotheby's.
</P>
<P>
   Or, at least, they used to be.
</P>
<P>
   As Japan muddles through its recession, even sushi, the ultimate
Japanese gastronomical obsession, is taking a bite.
</P>
<P>
   Next to rice, fish is perhaps Japan's most basic foodstuff, and
the decline in fish sales has paralleled the nation's economic
slump. Five years ago, the market sold $20.6 million of seafood
each day; this year sales dropped to $14.7 million. A single,
top-quality tuna to be served raw once commanded $20,000; on a
recent visit, the big earner was a 385-pound tuna for $8,346.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's economy has now contracted for three straight quarters,
and in this climate of anxiety, all but the wealthiest Japanese are
now saving instead of spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the worst I've seen in 40 years in this business,''
said Makoto Ishida, managing director of Tohto Suisan Co. Ltd., an
auction house at the market.
</P>
<P>
   Today, compared with the height of the bubble economy 10 years
ago, ``price and volume is about 30 to 40 percent down,'' he
estimated.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan's halcyon days of the 1980s, many people splurged on
the finest delicacies; the most conspicuous consumers sprinkled
gold leaf on their sushi before eating it. Today, while Japanese
staunchly resist cutting sushi out of their diets, many are looking
for ways to adjust their appetites.
</P>
<P>
   ``During this recession, many people are downsizing their
eating, cutting back or eating cheaper sushi,'' said Hirotoshi
Kosode, a senior auctioneer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cheaper fish is selling more, more expensive fish is selling
less, and some shops are selling cheaper fish, but charging the
same,'' he said darkly.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, cut-rate sushi bars are booming, stealing business
from moderate establishments by catering to gourmands adapting to
leaner times. Chefs at the priciest ``sushiyas,'' meanwhile, are
guarding clientele by maintaining top quality, and confide
gratefully that not everyone has run out of money.
</P>
<P>
   But for most people, lower-quality sushi at ``rotation''
restaurants, where customers serve themselves from a conveyor belt
and pay by the number of plates, has a new appeal. Many snubbed
those restaurants in the profligate 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Another approach is the all-you-can-eat philosophy, promoted by
the Edokko Zushi chain of restaurants, which offers enormous
portions of high-quality fish at low prices. In a no-frills
environment, Edokko profits from high volume by moving customers
through fast and limiting drinks.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Japanese people, sushi is very traditional and very
important compared to any other food. So even if normal people
can't get expensive stuff, we can still afford to buy cheap
sushi,'' Ishida said.
</P>
<P>
   Hirako Haruko, the owner of the medium-priced Kitahama sushi
bar, arrived early at the wholesale market so she could get the
best fish from middlemen. She said that the number of her customers
has dropped 30 percent since last year, and that each one eats less
than before.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't buy lower quality,'' she sniffed indignantly at the
suggestion that she economize, saying its more important to
preserve the reputation of her 47-year-old family-run restaurant.
``I prefer that my salary is down.''
</P>
<P>
   Reputation and quality are the mainstays of high-end
restaurants, like Sushi Kyubey, whose outlet at the Hotel Okura has
served the rich and famous for years. Here, the cheapest fare is a
12-gram piece of octopus sashimi for $2.30, while the dearest is a
tiny, mouth-melting morsel of fatty tuna belly &UR;  &LR; for $11.50. Dinner
for one costs about $150 without drinks.
</P>
<P>
   Head chef Makoto Shigihara says the price reflects not only the
highest-quality fish _ a slab of the best tuna breast costs the
restaurant $300 to $600 _ but also stringent quality control, with
two shifts of workers cutting, feeling and tasting the fish, and
sending it back if it's not the finest.
</P>
<P>
   Shigihara admits his is a ``high-society'' restaurant that has
catered to prime ministers and visiting dignitaries, including
President Clinton, who the chef recalls favored maguro tuna and
steamed abalone. But he said that instead of ``expecting customers
to just shut up and eat it ... we make sure the customer is
satisfied.''
</P>
<P>
   So Shigihara says he buys the best fish in town. He says some
regulars stayed away for a few months to try cheaper locales, but
many are back, because ``once you get used to sushi that suits your
tongue, it's very difficult to adjust your tastebuds just because
of price.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sushi is practical and there's no waste,'' Shigihara said.
``You order what you want to eat, you eat everything you order, and
you pay for what you eat. It suits the Japanese lifestyle. That's
why maybe not every sushi restaurant is doing well, but ours still
is.''

COMING DECADE DIFFICULT TO NAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK FEENEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the countdown to 2000 ticking away, debate continues to
rage over the three great millennial questions.
</P>
<P>
   Will all our computers crash at 12:01 a.m. on Jan. 1, 2000 (the
2YK crisis)?
</P>
<P>
   Does the new century start then or at 12:01 a.m. on Jan. 1,
2001?
</P>
<P>
   And does anybody really care?
</P>
<P>
   A fourth question, arguably even more vexing, has largely gone
unnoticed. Forget about centuries and millennia: what exactly do we
call the next decade?
</P>
<P>
   We were in the '80s. We are in the '90s. We're going to enter
... the Zeros? The Double Zeros? The Double Ohs? The Zeds? The
Aughts? The Naughts, perhaps?
</P>
<P>
   Word maven William Safire has proposed the ``Zippy Zeroes'' _ a
name as unlikely to be adopted as two others that have been bruited
about, ``The Zilches'' and ``The Uh-Ohs.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times editorial page, never one to miss an
opportunity to fill a vacuum in authority, has already plumped _
twice, no less _ for ``The Ohs.'' Wrote the Times in its best
high-Pollyanna mode in '83: ``The Ohs, with a connotation of
wonder, would be fittingly optimistic.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when Roy Blount Jr., the humorist and a member
of the usage panel of the American Heritage Dictionary, liked the
sound (if not the spelling) of the Times' candidate. Back in the
days of ever-deepening budget deficits, Blount proposed the next
decade should be called the ``owes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I had this all figured out a while back,'' he sighs.
But budget balancing, having closed the fiscal floodgates, has
reopened the linguistic.
</P>
<P>
   Blount reels off an impressive list of tongue-in-cheek
possibilities. ``The Woes.'' ``The Woesome O's.'' On the other
hand, ``The Awesome Aughts.'' Or ``The So-So O's.'' The
``post-Nineties.'' The ``From-Scratch,'' ``The Clean Slate,'' ``The
``Blank Check,'' the ``Tabula Rasa Decade.'' ``The Big O's.'' Or
``The ``Little O's.'' ``The Ne-O's'' _ or ``Neo-O's.'' ``The
``Two-Thou's.'' ``The ``20-O's.'' ``The Nulls.'' ``The MMO's''?
``The 2K's''? I guess that would apply to the whole next thousand
years.''
</P>
<P>
   As Blount suggests, going the numeric route doesn't really
settle anything. Calling the decade ``The 2000s'' simply creates
more confusion, since that's also the name of the century (the
millennium, too).
</P>
<P>
   Julia Child has a sentimental attachment to ``naughty-naughts.''
That's what the celebrated cookbook author's mother and her fellow
members of the Smith College class of '00 called themselves. Such
implied raciness has an obvious, fun-loving appeal as a name for
the next decade, but Child notes an interesting drawback.
``Naughty-naughts'' might bring back memories of the present White
House mess,'' Child laments.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, if ``naughty-naughts'' conjures up images of Bill
Clinton makin' Oval Office whoopee, then another contender,
``aught-naughts,'' carries overtones of Kenneth Starr chasing after
him.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Disch, a novelist and poet whose most recent book is ``A
Child's Garden of Grammar,'' offers a compromise solution: ``The
naughties.'' ``There'd be a kind of psychology in going from ``The
naughties'' to the teens,'' he points out.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, another name that's been suggested (albeit none too
seriously) is ``pre-teens.''
</P>
<P>
   Fred Mish, editor in chief at Merriam-Webster, the Springfield
dictionary publisher, argues for a progression that's numerical
rather than developmental. ``If you follow the pattern of '20s,
'30s, '40s,'' he says, ``I suppose you have to call it `the units.'
I don't know what else you would use between 0 and 10. Then, of
course, after that, we're off the hook, since everyone can agree on
the teens.
</P>
<P>
   The root of the problem is that there wasn't any established
name a century ago, either. ``People in the 1890s were intensely
decade conscious,'' says Michael Kammen, a Pulitzer Prize-winning
historian at Cornell University. ``They would refer to the '90s as
the Mauve Decade, for example. Yet once 1900 rolled around there
was no universally agreed-upon term for that new decade.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Wallraff drew the same conclusion two years ago in her
Word Court column in The Atlantic Monthly. For herself, she's
perfectly content with the lack of any universal name for the next
decade and sees no need to prescribe any.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's an opportunity to say, `it's not yet settled and you
get to vote,''' says Wallraff, who's preparing a compilation of her
columns for Harcourt Brace. ``It seems sort of unpleasant of me, in
this case, to be saying what I want it to be called. So, actually,
I have an interest in staying out of it, letting people settle it
for themselves, which is an awfully nice process.''

POLAROID FOUNDER WANTED A SNAPSHOT, NOT A PORTRAIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   During his lifetime, Polaroid Corp. founder Edwin Land actively
discouraged would-be biographers. When Mark Olshaker was finishing
up an unauthorized biography in 1978, Land sicced his lawyers on
the young writer. Ten years later, when a former colleague told
Land he too was planning to write a biography, Land replied, ``Why
would anyone want to read such a book?''
</P>
<P>
   Now Victor McElheny, a veteran science writer who worked with
Land, has published ``Insisting on the Impossible; the Life of
Edwin Land.'' This time Land has reached from beyond the grave to
thwart the efforts of a sympathetic biographer. In his first
chapter, McElheny reports that after Land's death in 1991, ``a
laboratory associate spent three years shredding his papers,
presumably on the inventor's instructions.''
</P>
<P>
   Insiders say the document purge was carried out by Land's
longtime executive assistant, Natalie Fultz, under the supervision
of Land's son-in-law, Philip DuBois. Fultz declined to speak with
me. DuBois reiterated Land's aversion to biography _ ``I made it
clear to Victor what our feelings were'' _ and wouldn't discuss the
destruction of any papers; ``That's a matter of his personal
life.'' He indicated that outside of corporate documents kept at
Polaroid, and scientific publications, there would be no Edwin Land
archive for scholars to peruse now or in the future: ``We are
respecting Dr. Land's wishes.''
</P>
<P>
   That's probably true. But in this instance, perhaps the family
should have over-ruled the secretive and imperious entrepreneur.
What has been lost is 60 years' worth of material documenting the
career of America's greatest inventor since Thomas Edison. Although
creating instant photography was no mean task, Land earned 535
patents in his lifetime, working on everything from the theory of
color vision to the U2 spy plane. A former Polaroid executive
called the loss of Land's files ``a catastrophe ... a tragedy for
future historians.''
</P>
<P>
   McElheny is the immediate victim of Land's machinations. His
467-page biography artfully recounts Land's many scientific
accomplishments, from his work on light polarization to the
grandiose, smashing failure of his instant movie system,
Polavision. But the book is virtually devoid of personal detail.
``It's a bit dry, this biography,'' comments Publishers Weekly in
an advance review.
</P>
<P>
   Land said he regarded the kind of biographical details that
writers hunger for _ stories about his family, his upbringing, his
religious formation _ as so many ``interchangeable variables.'' But
of course it is just those ``variables'' (what a cold, stupid
term!) that make us humans, and not machines.
</P>
<P>
   Land employed a small palace guard to shield his anonymity.
Multi-million dollars gifts to Harvard, and to the American Academy
of Arts and Sciences, are for the first time revealed in McElheny's
book. Fearful of kidnapping attempts _ and a trifle paranoid _ Land
paid a policeman to stand guard outside his home in Cambridge,
Mass., making it instantly recognizable to the world at large.
</P>
<P>
   Why the secrecy? Former Polaroid staffers say Land, a self-made
man who insisted on being called ``Dr. Land'' although he never
earned a PhD, feared the ridicule of academic scientists who often
spitballed his successful inventions. McElheny hints of difficult
relations between the assimilated Land and his observant, Jewish
parents: ``Anecdotal evidence suggests that some of (Land's)
relatives, perhaps including his father, resented how little they
shared in Land's ultimate wealth.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Polaroid veterans note that the workaholic Land hardly had
a life in the conventional sense. ``We'd say, `Have a nice weekend'
to each other on Sunday night at midnight and start working the
next morning at 6 a.m.,'' recalls Lucretia Weed, an executive on
the SX-70 camera project. ``His life was his science, and he wanted
it that way.''
</P>
<P>
   I interviewed Land on the subject of biography in 1987. After
re-stating his distaste for ``personal'' biography, Land jauntily
closed out the conversation with this quote from the Bible: ``By
their works, ye shall know them.'' Here is a man whose works we
know and celebrate, yet our knowledge of him is sadly incomplete.

   Ever forget to bring extra underwear on vacation? Or you're so
sweaty you need spare boxers at the gym. Or you're so busy that the
laundry just doesn't get done and you're stuck wearing Tuesday's
briefs?
</P>
<P>
   Rejoice! Next month, the underwear maker Joe Boxer Corp. plans
to unveil the unthinkable: underwear vending machines, where men
and women can buy undies with a swipe of a credit card.
</P>
<P>
   The company plans to install the machines nationally in places
like airports, fitness centers, university halls, and tourist
spots.
</P>
<P>
   The $14 to $18 products come compressed and sealed in aluminum
cans.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to briefs, customers will get entertainment. A
comedian's voice will tell a joke from the machine. And even if
you're just passing by, the machine, equipped with a motion sensor,
may speak to you. So now laundry haters, there's no excuse for
going bare.

   Okay, it's a little early to think about the holidays (even
though Macy's has had a dancing Santa Claus displayed for weeks).
But the cosmetic brand Clinique plans to make shopping easier this
year with a new registry service that will allow women to make wish
lists of the lotion, soap or lipstick they really want.
</P>
<P>
   Using a Clinique web site -- which will begin selling products
next month -- women can list their favorite products as well as the
e-mail addresses of the people they hope to receive gifts from.
Clinique will then send e-mails to those people informing them of
the list. If these potential customers are interested, Clinique
says it will sell the goods to them on-line and then ship them to
the original party in time for the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Viola! It's shopping made simple at www.clinique.com.

   &UR;  &LR; Michael Walsh made sure his letters of transit were in order
before he started the daunting task of writing an extension of
``Casablanca,'' the 1942 Warner Bros. movie classic that remains
hugely popular.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh's novel ``As Time Goes By,'' which arrives in bookstores
today, is a book as moneymaker. A marketer's dream. A Warner book
based on a Warner film. The copyright, usually owned or shared by
the author, is completely retained by Warner Books. The publisher,
with a worldwide printing of 1.1 million copies, hopes to make a
fortune.
</P>
<P>
   The publishing world is abuzz over the prospect. But it's a
risky proposition to tamper with a classic. The last time they
tinkered with ``Casablanca,'' about a decade ago, Ted Turner
colorized it. Fans were outraged, and it's nearly impossible to
find a colorized video of the film at any video store in town.
Alexandra Ripley, who wrote ``Scarlett,'' a sequel to ``Gone With
the Wind,'' America's other untouchable movie, was scorched in the
press. Readers and viewers are often outraged by tampering with
icons.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first question I'm always asked is, `How dare you?,'''
said Walsh, the novelist who was Time's classical music critic for
16 years and is now a visiting professor of journalism at Boston
University. ``It's a question like, `Well, aside from that, how did
you enjoy the play, Mrs. Lincoln?''' he said during an interview at
BU last week. ``The easy answer is that they asked me. The second,
more complicated one, is that I was intrigued. After watching the
movie three to six times, in whole or in part, and getting
permission to quote from the screenplay, I outlined my basic ideas
and sent it to Warner books. That was in the late spring or early
summer of 1996.''
</P>
<P>
   While everyone involved is reluctant to discuss figures, it's
clear millions of dollars are involved in the publishing effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a writer for hire,'' said Walsh. ``They have a valuable
franchise, and they weren't about to share it with me. If the book
does well, I will, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Buoyed by a strong ad campaign, including the center spread in
Sunday's New York Times Book Review, and by an upcoming publicity
tour that will land Walsh on everything from the network morning
shows to CNN, ``As Time Goes By'' is expected to hit the bestseller
list. But, in order to stay there, the novel will have to satisfy
both occasional readers and dedicated fans.
</P>
<P>
   Every major movie poll rates ``Casablanca'' as one of the top
three films of all time. Not a week goes by that we aren't hit from
a reference to the film. From classic lines such as ``Round up the
usual suspects'' to images of Bogie's Blaine advertising products
ranging from soft drinks to automobiles, Warner's is milking the
franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after the 1942 release, Julius and Philip Epstein,
the twin-brother screenwriters most responsible for the film's
script, were asked by studio head Jack Warner to write
``Brazzaville'' as a sequel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were tired of it. We didn't like `Casablanca' much in the
first place and thought we put all we had to offer in the
original,'' said Julius Epstein. ``Once she got on the plane, and
he walked off into the fog, we'd had it. We were on to other
things.'' ``Brazzaville never got made.''
</P>
<P>
   For decades, what drove Warner executives wild is that they had
a mine but they couldn't extract the gold. Two television series,
one in 1955 and another in 1983, starring David Soul as Rick,
bombed. Several writers attempted penning movie sequels. They
failed. Howard Koch, a screenwriter who's credited with writing
some of the original, tried to peddle a sequel in 1988. It didn't
generate interest. Several authors, whom Warner Books refuses to
name, tried writing ``As Time Goes By'' before Walsh was attached.
They failed. There was even some talk that Steven Bogart, son of
Humphrey and Lauren Bacall, might write it. Several revivals of the
play ``Everyone Comes to Rick's,'' the inspiration for the film,
have been mounted. They bombed.
</P>
<P>
   But Walsh has written something that may work, and well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't know why they selected me,'' he said. ``My
first novel, `Exchange Alley,' had a great deal of sex and violence
and seemingly nothing in common with `Casablanca.' But Maureen
Egan, an executive at Warner Books, asked me if I'd be interested
in taking a shot at a sequel to `Casablanca,' and I was intrigued.
I took the shot and here we are. I was never a huge fan of the
movie. And I think that was an advantage. I found the characters
and the situation intriguing, but I didn't worship the movie.''
</P>
<P>
   What Walsh manages to do is to respect the original without
treating it as gospel. He elucidates the mystery while keeping it
mysterious. He answers questions while retaining that foggy
ambiguity that's so integral to the movie's longevity. He
dramatizes what happened to Rick and Ilsa in Paris and expands the
character of Sam the piano player. He draws parallels between the
ideological intensity of freedom fighter Victor Laszlo and the
Nazis. And Ilsa plays a much more active role in the World War II
political intrigue.
</P>
<P>
   Many fans of the movie, a new edition of which will be released
Tuesday (Oct. 13) on video, believe that the bittersweet ending,
set in fog with Ilsa leaving with Victor and Rick beginning his
beautiful friendship with Louis, is perfect. And, in many ways it
is. But, without destroying that sense of ambiguity, Walsh creates
a postwar ending to his tale that maintains the spirit of the
film's finale.
</P>
<P>
   The book's ending was the fruit of a serendipitous moment. Early
on in the writing, Walsh, while waiting in his car outside an Ames
Department Store in upstate New York, hit an inspirational
bullseye.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh My God,'' he said of Rick Blaine, ``he's a Jewish
gangster.'' Walsh names him Yitzik Baline, appropriating Irving
Berlin's real last name.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given that three of the four writers were Jewish,'' he said,
``it makes sense. It also explains his background. Explains how
he's so good with a gun. He ran a New York nightclub for the Jewish
gangsters. It all started to come together after that.''
</P>
<P>
   From there, Walsh took off as fast as a '40s Warner Bros.
melodrama. Working most nights from 11 until 4, he zipped through
the story. Instead of just a sequel, he made the movie the
centerpiece and added two side panels _ the beginning on one side
and the ending on the other. In five weeks he completed a first
draft. And, after discussions with editors, including answering a
query from his German translator, ``What's a knish?'' Walsh
completed the novel in May.
</P>
<P>
   ``The book needed the right tempo,'' said Walsh, who lives with
his wife, Kate, and two daughters, Alexandra, 15, and Clare, 9, in
Boston and in their weekend home in Canaan, Conn. Walsh puts his
musical knowledge to good use in the literary form. ``I started
thinking of it as a Raoul Walsh film. It needed that tempo. I type
very fast, but I couldn't keep up with the ideas. Once I started,
it really took off.''
</P>
<P>
   While the story is big _ cutting between occupied France and the
New York underworld _ Walsh never forgets the two crucial elements
the Epstein brothers brought to the movie _ details and humor.
</P>
<P>
   Incorporating both the fictional characters and the personae of
the actors who portray them, he plays around with some fun touches.
In one, Ilsa plays the Kruetzer Sonata, a piece Ingrid Bergman
performed in another of her films, ``Intermezzo'' (1939). In
another, Rick declines an invitation to see ``High Sierra'' (1941),
a Bogart movie, saying he prefers musicals.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh skillfully blends the reader's preconceptions about the
characters and the stars into a form of iconography _ the movie
star as cast in a novel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think `Casablanca' has become part of a shared cultural
myth, and I used that in the book,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   No word on whether Warner Bros. plans to ruin everything by
making ``As Time Goes By'' into a movie.

BARTOLI BIOGRAPHER KNOWS THE SCORE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
CINDERELLA &AMP; COMPANY 
Backstage at the Opera with Cecilia Bartoli 
By Manuela Hoelterhoff 
Knopf, 259 pp., illustrated, $25 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Manuela Hoelterhoff has burned her bridges behind her and
written a hilarious, revealing, and sometimes malicious book about
operatic intrigue on and off the stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cinderella &AMP; Company'' apparently began as an attempt to write
a biography of Cecilia Bartoli, an attempt that was bound to fail
because the world's most popular young opera singer is too young,
too private, and too normal in every respect except her voice.
Hoelterhoff, the Pulitzer-winning music critic of The Wall Street
Journal, gave up her seats on the aisle to spend a year hanging out
backstage with Bartoli. This assignment and other factors gave her
an entree rarely granted to any journalist, and Hoelterhoff didn't
miss a thing during her travels.
</P>
<P>
   The book is centered on Bartoli, but that isn't the really
interesting part. Bartoli is at least as devoted to her family as
to her career, and her brother's illness and death became the major
issue in this period of her life. We learn that she drives her
manager and her record company crazy because she's not a workhorse
like Joan Sutherland _ she won't get on an airplane if she can
possibly help it (``I need to feel the ground under my feet,'' she
says), and she doesn't enjoy touring, especially in America, far
from home. She does like to eat, and Hoelterhoff repeatedly refers
to the discrepancy between the figure Bartoli cuts in her publicity
photos and her actual figure. To her credit, the mezzo-soprano
appears utterly indifferent to efforts to create an image for her.
``For her first albums and publicity shots, Bartoli dutifully put
on slinky clothes and a lot of lipstick, taking them off the minute
she could afford to say no, which wasn't long into her career. The
recital of Rossini arias ... shows her wearing trollop-red gloves
and rhinestone clumps dangling from her ears. That was in 1989.
This year, the cover was digitally transformed to give the mezzo
black gloves and tiny earrings.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoelterhoff establishes a context for Bartoli by tracing the
activities of Luciano Pavarotti, Placido Domingo, Carol Vaness,
June Anderson, Deborah Voigt, Renee Fleming, Jane Eaglen, Patricia
Racette, Roberto Alagna and Angela Gheorghiu, James Levine, and
other opera figures in the same time frame; there are also
portraits of managers, conductors, stage directors, administrators,
girlfriends, fans, and other elements of the operatic support
system, even a composer. There's also a lot of the racier gossip of
the period. Hoelterhoff's style is tartly amusing, but she
occasionally overplays her hand. Accompanying Bartoli at the piano,
James Levine ``scampered cheerfully over the keyboard when not
blowing her kisses between sets, or placing his hand over his heart
in a manner that could make a strong man heave into a bucket.''
</P>
<P>
   A few figures emerge with credit, particularly Voigt and
Fleming. Pavarotti is seen as an almost-tragic figure, bravely and
foolhardily soldiering on to the fast-approaching end of his
career. By comparison, his principal rival gets trashed. ``Domingo
was standing in the auditorium facing a camera and a microphone,
having managed to fit a TV interview into a short break, which
would now not be wasted. ... He was smiling, so I had to assume no
one was asking him what his wife of thirty-seven years, Marta
Domingo, thought about the twenty-one-year-old Romanian nymph he
had been squiring around Vienna, where she studied voice. Was he
giving her private tutorials?''
</P>
<P>
   Alagna and Gheorghiu, ``the love couple,'' emerge as monsters of
caprice; they are like opera singers in a cartoon. When Alagna sang
Rodolfo opposite the Mimi of another Romanian soprano, Leontina
Vaduva, ``Gheorghiu amused herself miming Mimi's music from the
wings while. ... Vaduva went through the bother of singing it.
Vaduva was hopefully getting used to these appearances. `My dear,
best be careful! Your high C is sounding a little low tonight,'
Gheorghiu was overheard telling her as the weary woman was sitting
in her dressing room during a performance of `Romeo et Juliette'
with Alagna a few months before at Covent Garden.'' The Met's
Joseph Volpe earned immortality when he threatened a balky
Gheorghiu on tour in Japan. ``That wig,'' he thundered, ``is going
on, with or without you.''
</P>
<P>
   Cumulatively ``Cinderella &AMP; Company'' presents a portrait of
world-class opera that will delight everyone who thinks of opera as
an elitist activity in the hands of greedy egomaniacs _ many of
whom are lechers, drunks, parasites, opportunists, and fools. The
book is a damning indictment, though it will please that portion of
the opera-house audience which relishes operatic intrigue for those
very reasons. After a while, most of it will enrage anyone who
thinks opera is worth taking seriously (thank God for Renee
Fleming, who does). In that respect Hoelterhoff's book is a little
like the now-notorious British television documentary series about
the administration of the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, which
became a lightning rod for criticism of arts funding and indeed the
arts themselves. Hoelterhoff's book will probably not lead to
important changes the way those television programs did. The only
change ``Cinderella &AMP; Company'' is likely to precipitate is that no
one in the operatic world will ever speak freely around Manuela
Hoelterhoff again.

MICROWAVE FEARLESSLY, CONQUER PHOBIA BY LEARNING TECHNIQUES THAT
WORK 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ANN STEINER 
and CICI WILLIAMSON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have you backed off from using your microwave because you're
afraid of it? Perhaps you've heard Halloween-style stories of
exploding eggs, squash or potatoes. Or, maybe you're like the chef
who confided to us, ``I don't cook in the microwave, ever. I just
use it to heat and warm. I will not replace my current machine when
it goes; I'd rather have the counter space.''
</P>
<P>
   He's definitely not on our wavelength. We couldn't live without
our microwaves. But many people who can track infinity on the
Internet may be totally intimidated by the microwave. If you are
using yours just to heat and warm, you're missing out on some great
cooking. Besides being fast, microwave cooking is easy, cool and
clean.
</P>
<P>
   Many foods are actually better when microwaved, we believe:
vegetables, sauces, fish fillets, some candies and snacks. You can
discard your double boiler because the microwave makes
smooth-as-silk sauces and custards without constant stirring. It
melts or softens chocolate, butter, cheese, jelly, jam, fruit
syrups, honey, peanut butter, ice cream and ice cream toppings. It
warms tostadas, tortillas and taco shells, softens hard brown sugar
and overset gelatin. You can use it to candy citrus peel and
pineapple, to soften or toast nuts and coconut, or to blanch
almonds.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
SEAFOOD &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's best to have the family or guests gathered near the table
when you begin to microwave seafood. In less than 5 minutes, you'll
be ready to serve a delicious entree. Fish doesn't reheat well _ it
tends to toughen _ so plan to cook the amount that will be eaten.
Use high power to microwave fish. Place thicker portions towards
the outside of the dish and cover with wax paper. To avoid
overcooking, remove fish from microwave when the outer edges are
opaque but the center is still slightly translucent. A few minutes
of standing time will finish the cooking.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
GROUND MEATS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you're fueling your fast-laners by grabbing a pound of frozen
ground meat at the last minute, here's one of the best ways we know
to get dinner on the table pronto. First, did you put it in the
freezer as a brick shape or make a doughnut of it? A brick shape
takes about twice as long to defrost because the center resists
thawing. When you form ground meat into a doughnut shape, the
microwave can have that ring of meat thawed and ready to cook in 3
to 4 minutes, partly because there's no frozen center.
</P>
<P>
   No need to open the package to shape a doughnut. Just push down
gently in the center of the plastic wrap and coax the meat away
from the center.
</P>
<P>
   When defrosting it, that's the time to remove all packaging and
place meat in the utensil to be used for your recipe.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   METHOD I: SPEEDY DEFROST AND SAUTE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Use this method only if the meat is to be cooked immediately
because the meat becomes warm, which encourages bacterial growth.
</P>
<P>
   Remove all packaging and place the pound of ground meat into a
dishwasher-safe plastic colander. Set colander in utensil to be
used for recipe. Microwave on high 1 minute. Use a fork to flake
defrosted portion onto wax paper; set it aside.
</P>
<P>
   Return frozen portion to microwave and repeat process two times.
Break up remaining meat and place all meat back into the colander.
If your recipe includes sauted onion, celery or bell pepper,
sprinkle the chopped raw vegetables on top of the meat. Stirring
midway through cooking, microwave on high 6 to 7 minutes. Discard
fat that drained into utensil and place meat mixture into same
utensil to complete recipe.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL; 
 &LR; METHOD II: DEFROSTING GROUND MEAT &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Remove all packaging and place the pound of ground meat in a
glass mixing bowl. Microwave on medium-low (30 percent) 4 minutes.
Use a fork to flake the defrosted portion onto a piece of wax
paper; set it aside. Return frozen portion to microwave and
microwave on 30 percent 2 minutes. Flake meat again. If any frozen
portion remains, microwave on 30 percent 1 to 2 minutes. By
removing thawed meat, the outer edges don't begin to cook, and the
defrosting is accelerated since microwaves can now reach the frozen
portion.
</P>
<P>
   Microwaving ground meat in a plastic colander is the most
efficient way to remove the maximum amount of fat from the meat
because the fat drains through the holes during cooking. Be sure to
suspend the colander over a casserole to catch that fat. Microwave
5 minutes per pound for ground chicken, turkey and beef and 6 to 7
minutes per pound for ground pork.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
RICE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The best rice cooker we know of is the microwave oven. If your
microwave can do multiple cooking with one programming, there's no
need to look back once you turn the oven on. No pot watching or
boil-overs. Here's how we like to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Combine 2 cups hot tap water and 1 cup raw regular rice in a
2-quart utensil; adding salt or butter is optional. Cover with lid
or vented plastic wrap and microwave on high 6 minutes, reduce
power to medium-low (30 percent) and microwave 12 to 14 minutes.
Fluff rice with a fork and let stand covered 5 minutes. Makes 3 to
3{ cups.
</P>
<P>
   For 7 cups cooked rice, double the above method and use a
3-quart casserole. Increase initial cooking time to 9 minutes on
high, then cook 16 to 18 minutes on 30 percent. Refrigerate or
freeze the extra rice for later use. Allow 1 minute on high to
reheat 1 cup refrigerated rice and 2 minutes on high for 1 cup
frozen rice.
</P>
<P>
   Another step-saver in microwaving casseroles that include rice
or noodles is to combine the raw rice or noodles with the other
ingredients. Of course, enough liquid needs to be included to cook
the rice or noodles.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
SOFTENING AND MELTING &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cheesecake: The San Francisco Chronicle did a taste test of our
Chocolate Turtle Cheesecake a few years ago. They baked the recipe
in the oven and the microwave. The microwave version won the
tasting. Cheesecakes that are made in the microwave come out
creamy, moist and smooth. It's faster and easier, too. You don't
have to set the pan in a water bath, and it's done in barely 15
minutes vs. more than an hour in an oven. Making the batter also is
easier.
</P>
<P>
   Cream cheese: You don't have to set the cream cheese out on the
counter to soften. Instead, microwave an unwrapped 8-ounce package
on medium (50 percent) power 1{ minutes; 2 (8-ounce) packages, 2{
to 3 minutes; or 3 (8-ounce) packages, 3 to 3{ minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Chocolate: Melting chocolate in the microwave beats using a
double-boiler on top of the range. It's much faster and reliable if
you use medium (50 percent) power. Chocolate continues to hold its
shape when microwaved. So, stir it to complete the melting process.
For 1 (1-ounce) square baking chocolate, microwave 1{ to 2 minutes
on medium. One cup chocolate morsels takes 2{ to 3 minutes on
medium. If melting chocolate with butter or cream, use medium-high
(70 percent) power.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
VEGETABLES &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Retaining the vitamins and bright color. Keeping the crunch.
Speeding the cooking. What better reasons to cook fresh veggies in
your microwave?
</P>

   Many vegetables are cooked without the addition of water or
other liquid _ there's enough within the vegetable itself.
Nutrients stay in the food instead of floating down the drain with
the liquid needed for conventional cooking.
</P>
<P>
   Three vegetables in particular microwave much faster than
cooking them conventionally: artichokes, potatoes and winter
squash. Cooking these conventionally takes 45 minutes to an hour.
An artichoke microwaves in less than 5 minutes; potatoes and winter
squash take about 6 minutes per pound.
</P>
<P>
   An ear of corn microwaves in about 3 minutes. It sure saves time
and heat in the kitchen as an alternative to boiling corn
conventionally in a large pot of water.
</P>
<P>
   To microwave corn in the husk: Remove tough outer husks, leaving
two layers of light green husk and silks intact. If microwaving
more than 2 ears at a time, arrange wagon-wheel fashion with the
tip of the ears at the hub and the base to the outside. Microwave
on high (100 percent) 2{ to 3 minutes for one ear; 4 to 6 minutes
for 2; 7 to 9 minutes for 4; and 10 to 12 minutes for 6.
</P>
<P>
   To cook a single ear in plastic wrap: Remove all husks and silk.
Wrap each ear in microwave-approved plastic wrap (such as Saran
wrap; use times listed above). Microwaving items wrapped in wax
paper is not recommended because it can impart a waxy taste.
</P>
<P>
   To cook corn in a casserole: Place in rectangular 2-quart glass
casserole and cover dish with plastic wrap. No need to add water.
Microwave for the same length of times listed above. Turn corn
upside down and re-arrange in casserole midway through cooking.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few guidelines for microwaving your vegetables to
perfection:
</P>
<P>
   Choose vegetables that are similar in shape and size so they
will cook more evenly.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce vegetables that are microwaved in their own skins with
the tip of a paring knife to prevent bursting _ potatoes, sweet
potatoes, winter squash or tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   Weigh vegetables to determine the correct amount of time to
microwave.
</P>
<P>
   Cover vegetables that aren't cooked in their own skin. This
traps the maximum amount of heat and moisture to promote quick,
even cooking.
</P>
<P>
   Arrange items such as potatoes and corn on the cob in
wagon-wheel fashion.

`CHARMED' NEEDS MORE EYE OF NEWT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
CHARMED 
Starring: Shannen Doherty, Holly Marie Combs, Alyssa Milano 
On: The WB 
Time: Wednesday at 9 p.m. 
Rated: TVPG 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The prospect of reformed TV brat Shannen Doherty playing a witch
on the new series ``Charmed'' has wry potential. Especially since
the show is the latest brainchild of executive producer Aaron
Spelling, the authority figure Doherty most offended during her
years on another one of his shows, ``Beverly Hills 90210.'' But
aside from the title of tonight's premiere episode, ``Something
Wicca This Way Comes,'' this new series is a mostly straight-faced
hour set in San Francisco that blends sisterly melodrama with the
supernatural. It's ``Party of Five'' meets ``Buffy the Vampire
Slayer,'' but with less angst and pathos than the former and more
adult pretension than the latter.
</P>
<P>
   The concept behind ``Charmed'' is that three feuding sisters are
united against evil when they discover they are witches. ``The
power of three will set us free,'' they chant against a nasty
warlock, causing him to combust into dust in their attic. Doherty
is the oldest, and the most temperamental; Alyssa Milano is the
irresponsible, boyfriend-stealing one; and Holly Marie Combs is the
innocent who wants to be a chef. As on ``Party of Five,'' parents
are out of the picture; their mother is dead and their father is
as-yet unaccounted for. Based on tonight's bland premiere, the
series could use more wit and suspense in its supernatural doings,
or at least a dose of Doherty-driven soap opera to juice up the
human dramas. As it is, ``Charmed'' is a pretty bland-tasting brew.

NAPA VALLEY AFFORDS MOMENT OF SERENITY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MICHAEL LONSFORD 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I've been visiting California's Napa Valley for more than 20
years; honeymooned there once, in fact. And despite the too-often
materialistic trappings of Disneyland, it remains _ in part and
certain parcels _ a magical place for folks like me from the muggy
flatlands.
</P>
<P>
   Tourists invade the valley to the tune of maybe 2 million a
year. Traffic along the main, and two-lane, Highway 29 can remind
you of an L.A. freeway at 5:30 on a bad Friday afternoon. Tour
buses have their own parking spaces at Robert Mondavi Winery, and
the grounds of Niebaum-Coppola Winery look like a Hollywood set
designed by _ guess who? _ film director Francis Ford Coppola. The
columns and fountains are actually tastefully done, but the fact
that they detract from the beauty of the old Inglenook winery is
enough to give any history lover a bad edifice complex.
</P>
<P>
   Napa is a contrast. Speaking of the Mondavi Winery, the tour
guides there are a friendly lot. But go across the highway to Opus
One _ jointly owned by Mondavi and the the owners of Chateau
Mouton-Rothschild of Bordeaux _ and the tour personnel are a
hoity-toity lot. Too bad.
</P>
<P>
   Another contrast: Napa, perhaps jaded by the tourist hordes, can
cop an attitude, especially at certain high-profile restaurants.
But don't include the new Bistro Jeanty in Yountville among the
snooty few. Good food, good martini, decent wine list _ and nice
folks. Turn off Highway 29 down Chambers Lane by Tra Vigne
Restaurant and go to the Napa Valley Olive Oil Co. and load up on
good, inexpensive extra-virgin olive oil, excellent Genoa salami,
positively cheap sun-dried tomatoes and friendly folks to take your
cash.
</P>
<P>
   You know how you can tell that times and trends have changed?
One of the main cut-throughs between the parallel Highway 29 on the
western side of the valley and the Silverado Trail on the eastern
side is Zinfandel Lane. Not Cabernet Lane or Chardonnay Lane, but
Zinfandel Lane. Fact is, there used to be a lot of zinfandel grown
in Napa. But much of it is gone, the $40,000-an-acre vineyard land
planted over to the more popular _ and more profitable _ cabernet
sauvignon, not to mention chardonnay, the Big Mac of California
white wines.
</P>
<P>
   I've stayed at many places in Napa, from B&AMP;B's to tony
hostelries. Alas, gone are the days when the art deco El Bonita
Motel charged $25 a night! But none could beat the ambience of the
guest house at Stags' Leap Winery on the southern Silverado Trail.
There may be more majestic views in Napa, but I've never seen any
prettier.
</P>
<P>
   Napa Valley is a 30-mile-long, 4- to 5-mile-wide valley, and
frankly I thought I had seen just about everything there was to see
there when I first visited Stag's Leap Winery a couple of years
ago. But I was awestruck by the beauty of the 107-year-old
Victorian Manor House and the beautifully landscaped grounds. How
had I missed this spot for so many years?
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, Stags' Leap is not open to the public; you have
to make an appointment. For another, it's hard to find. There is no
sign on the Silverado Trail, just a mailbox with an address on it,
and the driveway entrance is shared between Stags' Leap and Shafer
Vineyards next door.
</P>
<P>
   Stags' Leap Winery was founded in 1893. In time it would become
a resort and cattle ranch in addition to a working vineyard. In
1970, Carl Doumani, a bear of a man with a quick laugh and
catcher's-mitt hands, bought the property and eventually got the
winery back up and running. Although he sold the winery to Beringer
not long ago, winemaker Robert Brittan has stayed on.
</P>
<P>
   (There is another winery in the area with a similar name: Stag's
Leap Wine Cellars. Believe me when I say there is no similarity or
connection
</P>
<P>
   between these two wineries.)
</P>
<P>
   Historically, Stags' Leap did no tours and no tastings. So far
under the Beringer banner, it still doesn't. I hope it stays that
way. Let the thirsty tourists go visit Beringer's Rhine House a few
miles away or take the tram up to Sterling Vineyards. Great view
there. But stay away from Stags' Leap. Don't ruin a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   Let me tell you about a perfect morning in paradise:
</P>
<P>
   My friends have gone off to play golf, and I have the place to
myself, so a scenic jaunt is in order. It's about a mile jog from
the house down a walnut-tree-lined blacktop to the Silverado Trail
highway, and despite the clean, crisp and invigorating air, I'm
gasping on the return lap because it's slightly uphill. At least
that's my official excuse.
</P>
<P>
   After a quick shower, I take the Sunday paper outside and
collapse _ er, recline _ in a chaise lounge underneath two small
shade trees in front of the house, built in the 1920s. Where I'm
sitting overlooks a large, Italianate terraced garden full of
peppers and tomatoes and squash and onions and strawberries and god
knows what else two steps down in front of me. A row of 40-foot
palm trees, all with woodpecker holes in them, is about 50 feet
beyond the garden. In fact, one of those industrious (or bored?)
birds is rat-tat, rat-tat-tatting around back, doing its best to
topple an oak tree. Silly bird ...
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the palms are vineyards on a gentle slope. And beyond
that, a small, tree-covered hill.
</P>
<P>
   And there I sit: No cars, no pollution, and a velvet silence _
just the gentlest of breezes, and I am basking in peacefulness. In
the distance, a hawk sails silently upward on a thermal. This must
have been the way Napa was when wine was made by farmers, not
weekending socialites or nouveau riche refugees from San Francisco.
When wine was an affordable beverage to have with a meal, not a
$200 trophy in an etched bottle.
</P>
<P>
   This is one of those moments when, if we're lucky, we stumble
across real serenity, and we wrap it around ourselves and hold it
dear. Because its time must be short.
</P>
<P>
   Soon my friends will return, and I'll be glad to see them. Be
happy to share in their tangible tales of golf victories and
defeats.
</P>
<P>
   But I'll have little to say. How can I share my little secret _
that a morning as pure and priceless as anyone could want has just
been handed to me? And that I have quietly exulted in it. The
snapshot of that morning will go into my memory scrapbook, to be
recalled with quiet pleasure when the pace of life back home gets
too fast, too frenetic.
</P>
<P>
   Remember in ``Casablanca'' when Rick tells Ilsa, ``We'll always
have Paris''? Well, I'll always have that morning, with its tingly,
dry breeze and warm sun, the picture-perfect view _ and the gift,
however brief, of peace.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, it's a shame that Stags' Leap isn't open to the
public. Something that beautiful should be shared. But since it
isn't, my suggestion is this: If you want to visit Napa and want to
get a real feel for the place, try to find lodging in _ or beside _
a vineyard; it's not hard to do. And forget about home for a while
and sit outside, or take a walk at sunset or sunrise, and feel the
breeze and admire the beauty of the earth.
</P>
<P>
   And listen to the vines. And when you really listen, and hear
them speak to you and only you, you'll know the next time you open
a bottle of fine wine that more goes into it than grapes and a
little sweat. I think it's called romance.
</P>
<P>
   And speaking of wine: May I suggest the 1995 Stags' Leap Petite
Syrah? Somehow it seems appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   And that's the truth _ straight, no chaser.

TASTY TAPAS TREND TAKES OFF 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ANN CRISWELL 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Tapas, delectable little bites, are making it big at
parties and on restaurant menus. They suit today's lifestyles
because they're usually easy to make and don't require cooking
expertise. They're perfect for little meals or finger-food snacks
with drinks. Tapas (pronounced TOP-ahs), translated ``lids on
top,'' are appetizers _ the Spanish equivalent of French hors
d'oeuvres and Mexican bocas (short for ``bocados,'' meaning
mouthfuls or bites).
</P>
<P>
   It's the second time around for tapas. Although some Houston
restaurants have offered tapas for about 20 years, they enjoyed a
brief fad in the '80s, then faded.
</P>
<P>
   Tapas went the way of fondue and crepes until the '90s, when
restaurants introduced Houstonians to South American-style tidbits.
</P>
<P>
   Restaurants concerned with authenticity have an education job on
their hands. Some classic Spanish ingredients are an acquired
taste, particularly smelt, salt cod, baby eel (angula), squid
(calamare), snails, octopus, baby anchovies (boquerones), chorizo
sausage, blood sausage (morcilla) and salty-cured Serrano ham.
</P>
<P>
   Shrimp, mussels, a variety of olives, bowls of almonds, fresh
pimentos and Spanish Tortilla (potato omelet) receive more instant
acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   Penelope Casas has written several books on Spain. In her books,
she offers a wealth of tips on tapas, including the following:
</P>
<P>
   Choose a variety of tapas _ vegetables, meats, seafood. Prepare
one or several from each category: fried, baked or grilled; cold or
marinated; in sauces; or with bread or pastries.
</P>
<P>
   For a large group, choose finger foods or serve tapas on
toothpicks. Make 10 to 20 different tapa varieties and set them out
buffet-style.
</P>
<P>
   Tapas that need last-minute preparation and should be eaten
immediately, should be spaced over the course of the evening and
passed on trays.
</P>
<P>
   For a small gathering, start with lighter tapas, such as
rice-filled pimentos or seafood-stuffed mushrooms, and progress to
more filling tapas.
</P>
<P>
   Serve tapas with sherry (well-chilled fino sherry is
traditional), especially if tapas are spicy or salty. Serve with
the appropriate white or red wine, beer or sangria.
</P>
<P>
   Among popular tapas with drinks are croquettes (made with
potatoes or seafood), grilled vegetables with garlic sauce,
Potatoes Bravas (spicy potatoes), cheese (Mi Luna offers a platter
with goat cheese, Brie and manchego tossed in olive oil that has
been infused with peppercorns, chervil and lemon), marinated olives
and mushrooms. &QL;

   CEVICHE SOLERO
</P>
<P>
   From ``Houston Is Cooking At Home'' by Ann Criswell (Houston
Gourmet, $21.95).
</P>
<P>
   INGREDIENTS: 1 pound each: shrimp, peeled and deveined, and
boneless, skinless snapper fillets &QL; 
1 tablespoon each: olive oil, fresh orange juice and white vinegar &QL; 
2 cups fresh lime juice &QL; 
1 tablespoon each, chopped: garlic and red onion &QL; 
{ cup diced red bell pepper &QL; 
1 jalapeno with seeds, diced &QL; 
pinch of ground cumin &QL; 
1 teaspoon salt &QL; 
1 tablespoon chopped cilantro leaves &QL; 
2 tablespoons passion fruit puree (see note) &QL; 
endive, lettuce, bell pepper strips and lime slices for garnish &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cut shrimp and snapper into 1-inch pieces. Cook shrimp in
boiling water to cover 1 minute. Drain, cover and refrigerate until

SOLVING THE PUZZLE OF LONGITUTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MCCABE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Longitude lunatics.''
</P>
<P>
   That's how the 18th-century English painter William Hogarth
depicted his contemporaries who sought to solve the riddle of
longitude, or east-west position on the earth's mapping grid.
</P>
<P>
   You can see Hogarth's vivid representation of these ``lunatics''
_ and enjoy an engrossing story _ on ``Nova'' episode, ``Lost at
Sea: The Search for Longitude,'' which also launches the estimable
series's 25th season this week on PBS. It's based on the
best-selling book ``Longitude,'' by Dava Sobel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lost,'' narrated by Richard Dreyfuss, shows Britain's top
scientists, admirals, and members of Parliament as they grapple
furiously in a determined, sometimes wacky quest to rule the seas
by keeping their ships from getting lost. The government offered a
prize of 20,000 pounds (millions of dollars today) to the person
who could solve the intractable problem of navigation.
</P>
<P>
   The unlikely hero of the story is John Harrison, played by
British actor Patrick Malahide, a young, obsessive, determined,
self-taught rural English clockmaker who turned out to be, as one
observer put it, ``150 years ahead of his time.'' Derided as a
``joiner's son from Lincolnshire,'' he'd never been to sea. Yet in
spite of the efforts to ignore him and his work, he was the driving
spirit in the understanding of longitude. To our good fortune,
Harrison kept a fascinating account of his relentless 43-year
struggle to surmount the myopia of the British establishment. The
powers that be focused stubbornly and solely on astronomy as the
key to the puzzle (one proposal required 30 warships in a row
successively firing ``sky rockets''). They derided the importance
of the accurate measurement of time, which turned out to be
essential.
</P>
<P>
   The efforts continued despite failure and discouragement. In
France, Louis XIV complained that he'd lost ``more territory to
astronomers than to my enemies'' when they measured the French
coast for him. The most resonant images show Harrison's meticulous
experiments. They include his devising of a large, intricate clock
in 1722 that still functions today. We see the inspired Harrison
standing excitedly in a doorway while listening to clocks in
adjoining rooms simultaneously to help him calibrate time and
temperature.
</P>
<P>
   The climax of ``Lost'' is set on the tropical island of
Barbados, where the plot thickens. Ultimately, King George III, to
whom Harrison and his son wrote in supplication, must decide where
the prize money will go. The ending proves that, in the words of
the narrator, ``knowing where you are is knowing what time it is.''

REALITY SHIFTS IN `STONEWALL' AS PLAY EXAMINES HISTORICAL, MODERN
PERCEPTIONS OF RACE RELATIONS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By EVERETT EVANS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Stonewall Jackson's House'' takes playgoers on a tour through
the minefield of race relations, historical perceptions and
political correctness. In Jonathan Reynolds' acclaimed off-Broadway
play, making its Houston debut at Main Street Theater, it's a trip
full of unexpected detours, ingenious surprises and provocative
insights.
</P>
<P>
   The play begins in the manner of a brightly sardonic cartoon. A
perky young African-American tour guide, dressed in Civil War-era
costume, is leading a group through the historic home of the
legendary Confederate general. She recites her spiel like a
mechanical doll, pausing to answer questions from two couples: a
genial, middle-age pair from Ohio, and two outspoken Alabama
``rednecks.'' The latter, history buffs, know far more about
Jackson than the guide and are obsessively concerned with the
authenticity of the house's furnishings.
</P>
<P>
   At intervals, the group freezes while LaWanda (the guide)
reveals her true feelings: her life is a wreck, she hates her
dead-end job and she can barely tolerate the patrons' inane
questions about Civil War arcana.
</P>
<P>
   The play then shows LaWanda's fantasy of the Civil War era, with
herself as a grateful slave and the innocuous middle-age couple as
her benevolent masters. When she re-awakens to the tour and her
miserable reality, LaWanda shocks the Goshens (the older couple) by
proposing that she return with them to Ohio as their property, in
``uncruel but abject'' slavery. She looks forward to never having
to make another decision (``I'll never have to choose an HMO'') and
having her owners take all responsibility for her life.
</P>
<P>
   The play's reality shifts again. The characters are revealed as
the actors and staff of an off-Broadway company trying to decide
whether to include ``Stonewall Jackson's House'' in an upcoming
festival of one-act plays. Tracy, who has been playing LaWanda, is
the theater's literary manager, who argues that any play about a
black woman who yearns to retreat into slavery is racist and should
be dropped. The man who has been playing the redneck husband is Joe
Rock, the play's author; he argues in its defense. The genial older
couple turn out to be Oz and Gaby, husband-and-wife directors of
the company and Tracy's professional mentors.
</P>
<P>
   As the group discusses the play's point and purpose, ``Stonewall
Jackson's House'' becomes a forum on history, race, political
correctness and artistic principles. ``It's about the need for the
welfare state,'' one character insists, while another argues the
play ``can't be racist because the rednecks also want to be
slaves.''
</P>
<P>
   The situation evolves into a metaphor for another kind of
freedom vs. slavery. Can artists remain free to follow their
vision? Or must they always enslave themselves by compromising with
some funding source or power structure, just to make their art
happen?
</P>
<P>
   Particularly in its brisk first act, Reynolds' play is full of
fresh ideas and sardonic riffs on history, as well as current
attitudes. There is a witty paraphrase of the famous joke asking
Mrs. Lincoln's reaction to ``Our American Cousin''; in this case,
the line comes out as ``Aside from the racism, how did you like the
play?''
</P>
<P>
   The second act does not quite sustain the promise of the first.
The theater staff's debate, for all its clever references and
theatrical in-jokes, goes on too long and grows repetitive. One
misses the frequent shifts and surprises of the first act, though
Reynolds does have some ironic turns reserved for the play's
slightly overdue conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Director Charlene Hudgins does well maintaining the sly satiric
tone, especially in the often giddy fantasy of the first act _ even
if she cannot quite disguise the static quality of the second act's
long debate.
</P>
<P>
   Cheray D. Martin plays LaWanda, and later Tracy, with
intelligence and energy. Veering from eager-to-please ebullience to
exasperation and desperation, she gives the production a strong
center.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Menzel, formerly director and star of Houston's Comedy
Workshop troupe, is ideal as the avuncular tourist from Ohio and as
the waffling company director Oz. As his partner, Ellen Suits makes
an ever-beaming Ohio wife, then a prickly spouse and bossy
co-director.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph E. Hudson is amusingly loutish yet shrewd as Junior
Nuckolls, the redneck Confederacy expert; he later doubles as the
playwright nursing his wounded pride. Brooke Baumer is brash and
broad as the redneck wife Mag, more restrained in her second role
as the sophisticated Claire, the Brit scheming to usurp Tracy's
place as Oz and Gaby's successor to direct the company.
</P>
<P>
   Though it runs out of steam for part of its second act,
``Stonewall Jackson's House'' boasts the kind of invention and
outrageousness one would like to encounter more often. &QL;

MUTUAL FUNDS: DOWN THE DRAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; BOSTON _ How the mighty &UR;  &LR; have fallen. Shackled with the worst
quarterly losses since Wall Street's spectacular run began eight
years ago, mutual fund shareholders and portfolio managers have
gone from record market highs to nightmarish losses in the bat of
an eyelash.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks, throughout the 1990s the investment of choice, now seem
as appetizing as the Plague _ especially after the average US stock
fund lost 15 percent in the third quarter, a period that included
Wall Street's all-time high. So far in 1998, gains have pulled a
disappearing act, socking most investors with year-to-date losses
for the first time this decade.
</P>
<P>
   So why are strategists so divided over whether the market
correction is conjuring up the ghost of bear markets past? Why
haven't investors run screaming for the exits? And why do mutual
funds still appear to be a good bet, despite the fact that many
fund managers compounded the third-quarter pain by losing even more
than the broader market?
</P>
<P>
   The answers lie both in the particularities of the US stock
market's downturn, which strangely comes amid a generally strong
domestic economy, and in new evidence of how American investors
have acted during the worst market volatility in 60 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very unique bear market _ in fact, we still can't
call it a bear market,'' said Larry Horwitz, managing director of
Primark Decision Economics in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   One doesn't often find a depressed stock market in an economy
lacking reams of bad news. With low inflation and unemployment,
good growth, and strong consumer spending, the US economy has
largely escaped the global financial crisis that began in Asia.
Still, an increasing number of economists see potential signs of
strain; to keep things humming, the Fed cut interest rates last
week, a move that may boost stocks.
</P>
<P>
   A bear stock market is technically defined as broad losses of 20
percent or more relative to highs. By such criteria, last quarter's
10.3 percent drop in the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index, the widest
measure of the US market, puts a volatile Wall Street in a
correction, the bear's milder cousin. While a rollercoaster
September did much to buffer losses, the index is down 10.4 percent
through last Friday from its July 17 peak.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as many investors will see when they open their next
statements, many mutual funds lost far more than 10 percent for the
quarter ended Sept. 30; those that invest in small-company and
mid-sized stocks declined an average 19.8 percent, according to
Lipper Analytical Services, the fund tracker that computes returns.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the only investment objectives with gains last quarter
were gold funds, which rose 4.3 percent, and domestic long-term
bond funds, up 1.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Even more pointed is the difference in performance between the
popular, unmanaged funds that mirror the composition and returns of
the S&AMP;P 500, and actively-managed funds that invest in those same
blue-chip, large-company stocks but hold others as well. S&AMP;P 500
index funds lost 10 percent in the quarter. By contrast, growth
funds, which buy a wider range of stocks, had far more outsized
losses of 13.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   When one considers that the average New York Stock Exchange
issue is now 40 percent below its high earlier this year, according
to William Markos of Ipswich Capital Managment, Wall Street looks
even more in the bear cave.
</P>
<P>
   Most fund managers have lagged their benchmarks in recent years.
But the disparity became greater last quarter _ sometimes by as
much as three or so percentage points _ as an increasingly narrower
range of stocks showed gains. The further a fund manager bought
stocks outside the S&AMP;P 500 or in ratios dissimilar to the makeup of
that index, the greater the losses. Factor in fees and expenses for
actively-managed funds, and the red ink is even brighter.
</P>
<P>
   In a world flirting with a downturn, there was no refuge abroad.
Europe, whose stock markets were flying high earlier this year, is
in the doldrums; European region funds were down 17.3 percent last
quarter. Funds invested in Latin America were an investor's idea of
hell, sinking 29.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are bear market funds, which rise when markets
fall but slip when stocks swell. Such funds lost out during the
eight-year bull market but reaped gains in the last quarter. The
Prudent Bear fund rose 21.9 percent, the industry's best performer.
</P>
<P>
   But with the vast majority of actively-managed funds now showing
losses for the year, the rhetoric of performance has shifted. The
only broad diversified equity funds with gains for 1998 are S&AMP;P 500
index funds, ``passive'' funds that involve no stock picking. They
are up 5.6 percent so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   Most money managers are now concerned about return of principle,
rather than return on principle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's 10 or 20 names that are doing all the work for the
market,'' said Thomas O'Neill, Fleet Financial Group Inc.'s chief
equity strategist. ``It's hard to find good stocks. The best stock
pickers I know are having the worst time right now.'' Against this
backdrop, portfolio managers might be forgiven for feeling trapped
inside a horror house.
</P>
<P>
   As the unwinding of hedge fund losses threatens to wreak more
global economic havoc, debt markets shudder at Russia's lurch
toward the title of world's biggest defaulter, and US companies
issue profits warnings, fund managers face plenty of traumas not of
their own handiwork. After betting big on stocks, especially on the
big stocks that until recently had produced all the gains, money
managers have little leeway these days to do anything except ride
out the downturn.
</P>
<P>
   Big equity funds, and even more conservative growth and income
funds, which invest in bonds as well as stocks, aren't about to
make a major shift into bonds, even if those markets do pick up.
That is because most large mutual funds are in long-term corporate
retirement plans, whose investment strategies are basically
engraved in stone and whose owners frown on change.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, large funds can generally buy only the most liquid,
biggest stocks. That worked well in recent years, when
large-company stocks were in favor. But many of the Nifty 50 once
deemed sure-fire earners in any climate have fallen off their
pedestals, issuing profit warnings as Asia's downturn spreads.
Gillete, for example, said last week third-quarter profits would
drop 20 percent on lower sales in Russia and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Still, nine of the 10 largest stock funds lost less than their
investment objective averages last quarter _ a relatively
impressive performance that suggests their bets on the biggest
stocks helped buffer losses. For example, Fidelity Investment's
$62.3 billion Magellan, the world's biggest fund, slipped 11
percent, nearly 3.5 percent better than the average growth fund.
More impressively, the fund is up nearly 6 percent for the year,
compared to the average growth fund's 0.2 percent loss.
</P>
<P>
   Had Tolstoy been thinking about mutual funds, not the Russian
aristocracy, in his famous opening to ``Anna Karenina,'' he might
have swapped the concept `family' for `fund' and written, ``All
funds are unhappy, but each is unhappy in its own individual way.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, not all of the third-quarter carnage is alike.
</P>
<P>
   Case in point is the $41.7 billion Washington Mutual Investment
fund, the biggest stock and bond fund around. It lost 7 percent
last quarter, over five percentage points less than the average
growth and income fund, and has positive year-to-date returns of
4.8 percent. By contrast, the troubled $16.3 billion Vanguard
Windsor fund, also a growth and income fund, lost 19.5 percent last
quarter, and is down 11.2 percent so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   Amid all the gloom, what have investors done? Many have put new
money into more conservative money market and bond funds. In
August, when the market was at one point 20 percent below its July
17 high, investors yanked $11.2 billion out of stock funds, the
most ever and the first monthly outflow in eight years. Still, that
sum represents only five out of every $1,000 invested in equity
funds, and less than half a percent of the fund industry's total
assets, which now stand at $4.7 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The confidence of the investor in the mutual fund concept
remains constant,'' said Avi Nachmany, an analyst at Strategic
Insight in New York, a fund consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Nachmany thought it unlikely investors would exit stocks and
plow full scale into bonds, since the long-term gains from stocks _
about 10 to 12 percent a year, on average _ are historically
greater. Still, new money is increasingly favoring fixed-income
funds. Bond fund sales over the first nine months of this year are
up 387 percent to $51.36 billion compared to year-ago levels,
according to the Investment Company Institute, the fund industry's
trade group.
</P>
<P>
   All that points to a major shift in investor psychology _ but
not one that involves, at least at this point, a mass exodus from
the stock market. While painful, the third-quarter declines bring
five-year returns in line with historic averages.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the coming months will be crucial. Two and a half months
ago, stock investors were close to bagging a 20 percent-plus annual
gain for an unprecedented fourth straight year. Now they are
staring at a market in which, for the first time in eight years,
bonds are the best bet. And October has a historical precedent for
being volatile.
</P>
<P>
   But the last two bear markets for stocks, in 1987 and 1990, were
brief, lasting only several months.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have now is harsher than a correction,'' said John F.
Ballen, president of Massachusetts Financial Services and an
investment professional often called a stockpicker's stockpicker.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think it's going to be pretty short-lived.''

AUTHOR SAYS ILLNESS DOES NOT HAVE TO DEFINE YOUR LIFE 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BARBARA KARKABI 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   From the time she was 5, Kim Nelson suffered from painful
rheumatoid arthritis and felt she could never be a vigorous person.
</P>
<P>
   It was a belief that colored her whole life. But during a
four-day therapy workshop led by psychologists Blair and Rita
Justice in the Colorado Rockies, Nelson discovered what a powerful
effect belief has on the body.
</P>
<P>
   She had always thought she had to get rid of her disease to
enjoy life. She believed that her pain and inflamed knee meant it
was impossible to climb a mountain, as the group was assigned to do
on the workshop's last day.
</P>
<P>
   She was more than a little surprised when Justice advised her to
``let her pain sing,'' advice he borrowed from the playwright
Arthur Miller. But as Nelson slowly made her way up the mountain,
she tapped into a sense she never knew she had.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kim's identity shifted from pain and illness to an inner sense
of health and strength,'' Justice writes in his new book. ``She
discovered her health when she connected to a wholeness beyond the
body, to the flowers and mountains, to the group that sang with her
and to a new and deeper sense of being well inside herself.''
</P>
<P>
   An award-winning former science writer and professor of
psychology at the University of Texas-Houston School of Public
Health, Justice has written ``A Different Kind of Health: Finding
Well-Being Despite Illness'' (Peak Press, $22). The book challenges
the traditional notion that being healthy also means being free of
disease, chronic illness or pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was struck by adult health surveys where they ask people
about their health, that they were coming around to the view that
the most powerful question which needs to be asked is: `In general,
what type of health do you think you are in?' '' Justice said. ``Do
you think you are a healthy person, very healthy, sick, very sick?
They were really intrigued to find that even though 50 percent of
the population say that on any given day they had a medical
condition, 80 percent said `I'm a healthy person'. ''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Justice said, there is another kind of health than the
one physicians look for in their examinations. And he does not
believe sick people who say they feel well are in denial:
</P>
<P>
   ``They all acknowledge their illness; it's just a demonstration
that pain and a sense of well-being can exist side-by-side if you
are complete enough in other aspects of your life,'' Justice said.
``If you look at the self, it is made up of physical parts, mental,
emotional, relationships with people and animals. So, if you have
got your life together in these other parts, you can feel at your
core that you are whole _ which is what health is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   A person's view of his own well-being is known as ``subjective
health.'' Objective health confirms the presence or absence of
disease; it is not health as much as the absence of disease, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   For the 33 million Americans who suffer from chronic and
recurring illnesses such as cancer and AIDS, the growing belief
that you can be ``sick but well'' should prove to be a lifesaver.
The introduction by Naomi Judd, who was diagnosed with Hepatitis C
in 1990, says that though the book may not save your life, it will
``transform the quality of how you live it, right up to the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Porter Storey, medical director of The Hospice at the Texas
Medical Center believes we definitely need a wider view of what
health is. ``I see many people who are healing old wounds despite
progression of disease,'' he said. ``I am convinced that health has
much more to do with the interaction between our mind, body and
spirit than what the X-rays and lab tests show.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice's personal journey to overcome chronic depression and
deal with his daughter's drug addiction and eventual death, is the
thread that holds ``A Different Kind of Health'' together.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started my first episode of clinical depression in my 20s as
a reporter with the Fort Worth Star Telegram,'' Justice said. ``I
didn't really know what was wrong, and even though I received
treatment, I didn't really lose the gut ache that was part of it.
Then when I got into something more physical, like surgery on a
cluster of basal cell carcinomas on my chest that left a huge hole,
I began to see the strong connection between the mind and body.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice noticed that his wound would be healing fine until he
had a bout of depression about his daughter's battle with drug
addiction or concern about something else. Then the healing would
stop. After his daughter Liz almost died in the intensive care unit
of a New York hospital, Justice realized her death was only a
matter of time, since numerous programs had been unable to help.
</P>
<P>
   He began going to a series of seminars on death and dying. That
led to volunteer work with The Hospice at the Texas Medical Center.
In the '80s he began mountain climbing, which helped him deal with
his depression. His office at UT, where he is also associate dean
for academic affairs, is filled with photographs of beautiful
mountain scenes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never have started to climb without getting caught up in the
beauty,'' Justice said. ``You can just lose yourself in it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the mid '90s, Justice was asked to work on a pilot research
project with a group of women who had just completed treatment for
breast cancer, studying the effects of imagery and support on the
immune system. Many reported health in the presence of disease, he
said and were proof of what he calls Fordyce's Law. Named for
Willard Fordyce, the father of pain research in this country, the
axiom says that people suffer less when they find something to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are happiest when they are outside themselves and not
thinking about themselves,'' Justice said. ``So much of getting out
of the self and not suffering is having a real well-defined goal
that you can come back to.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice listed a number of ways to find subjective health and an
abiding feeling that life is good in spite of illness: perceiving
some value in the experience, letting go of old resentments,
volunteer work, meditation and strong religious connections, as
well as using a freeze-frame technique to deal with stress.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like having a video camera and pushing the pause
button,'' Justice said. ``What they have trained people to do is
when you start feeling angry and really uptight or stressed, just
stop yourself and reflect on something you appreciate in life. It
has a remarkable calming effect and you reduce the stress hormones
that can damage the immune system.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is a difference, Justice said, between being healed
and being cured.
</P>
<P>
   ``Curing is getting rid of something and usually requires some
external intervention,'' Justice said. ``With a chronic illness
that is not going to happen. The definition of healing is making
whole something inside yourself. Whether we live or die, we have to
use that inner health to bring ourselves peace.'' &QL;

PAGING FIRMS BANK ON THE ABILITY TO TALK BACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The wireless pager that delivers a simple phone number is
growing up, becoming a hip-hugging e-mail messenger.
</P>
<P>
   Pagers have been used widely since the 1980s by salespeople,
doctors, electricians, and others who needed to stay in touch while
on the go. But even though more than 50 million people nationwide
now use them, the devices have been overshadowed during most of the
1990s by cellular phones. The paging industry in recent years has
struggled with steep losses, corporate consolidations, and
cut-throat pricing.
</P>
<P>
   But paging companies are trying to battle back with a new
weapon: two-way paging. The technology solves traditional paging's
biggest limitation: one-way communication. With two-way paging,
instead of running to a phone to respond, users can receive and
send messages by tapping on a miniature keyboard _ no need to pick
up the phone.
</P>
<P>
   Two-way pagers, which are about the size of a deck of cards,
also can be used as address books and appointment calendars. They
can provide access to data over the Internet and to news reports
and weather updates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hold the pager in my hands and use my thumbs to tap out a
message like, `I'm in a meeting, will call you back in an hour,'''
said Kenneth Hyers, an industry analyst at Cahners In-Stat Group's
wireless PCS research group. ``This kind of paging capability will
attract certain business users who may be tied to a cellular phone
but want another option _ one where they can communicate quickly
and less intrusively.''
</P>
<P>
   David Gregson, a technical support manager at Ropes &AMP; Gray, the
large Boston law firm, says he responds to more than 20 messages a
day using an alphanumeric keyboard pager from SkyTel Communications
Inc., the leading two-way paging provider based in Jackson, Miss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can respond ... far faster with a two-way pager than I could
using a mobile telephone,'' said Gregson. ``In fact, I've reduced
my business cell phone bills from $120 a month to around $40 now.
Plus, people respond to me far faster by electronic mail than they
did by phone, so I get a &UR;  &LR; lot more done.''
</P>
<P>
   For all its promise, however, two-way paging is pricey. The new
pagers _ made by Motorola Inc., Glenayre Technologies Inc. of
Charlotte, N.C., and Research in Motion Ltd., a Canadian company _
can cost from $195 to $360. That's as much as 10 times more than
one-way numerical pagers.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the monthly service charge starts at 2 1/2 times
the cost of basic paging, with some two-way users spending more
than $35 per month, depending on the volume of messages.  &UR;  &LR; But
unlike cellular phone calls, there are no roaming or toll call
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's far from a sure bet that two-way paging can revive
the industry. Consumer prices for such service are still high, and
it's unclear how many users of one-way paging will move up. The
industry is looking to Skytel's two-way technology to gauge
customer demand. And the cost and technical complexity of a
nationwide two-way network to relay signals could hamper full
adoption.
</P>
<P>
   In the Boston area, two-way paging service has been catching on
in recent months with the introduction of more compact pagers that
allow users to directly get Internet electronic mail.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  The main providers locally are Skytel, Page Network,
BellSouth, and Arch Communications.
</P>
<P>
   ``The driving force for us and the entire paging industry is
full-text messaging _ the ability to get simple messages and more
complex ones _ like pulling down data off the Internet or the
corporate intranet, no matter where you are,'' said C. Edward
Baker, chief executive of Westborough-based Arch Communications
Group Inc., which is acquiring MobilMedia Corp. of Fort Lee, N.J.,
a deal that will make it the nation's second-largest paging
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years the paging industry has not had a technology that
could add more value for the customer ... We all used the same
one-way paging system and could only grow by cutting prices,'' said
William F. Lenahan, president and chief executive of BellSouth
Wireless Data LP, formerly RAM Mobile Data, which was acquired by
BellSouth Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly forgotten by Wall Street, the leading paging companies
are betting their futures on wireless electronic mail services for
business customers. Motorola, the leading manufacturer of pagers
and developer of two-way paging technology, estimates that 25
million mobile business professionals are away from the office more
than 25 percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   Several paging companies are offering customers new types of
customized services, including news headlines, stock quotes, travel
information, and sports scores.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, at a recent convention in Tampa on wireless
personal communications, users of two-way paging could obtain the
latest tracking information on Hurricane Georges from the National
Weather Service _ and make a quick getaway before the storm was
expected to hit. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Since not everyone can afford two-way paging, the leading
carriers have each developed lower-priced services known as ``1.5''
paging.
</P>
<P>
   Designed to replace one-way paging, it's aimed at business users
who want the assurance that their their messages were delivered
along with the ability to respond with one or two-word
pre-programmed responses. Skytel offers a service that enables its
1.5-paging customers to scroll through their messages and push a
button to activate up to 15 commands, such as ``yes,'' ``no,''
``thank you, ``on my way,'' and ``will arrive 15 minutes later.''
</P>
<P>
   Yankee Group estimates that the number of people using 1.5
paging services will zoom from nearly 375,000 nationwide this year
to nearly 1.5 million next year and more than 14.3 million by the
end of the 2003.
</P>
<P>
   In yet another fancy wrinkle, a few paging carriers are
promoting voice messaging _ the ability to hear the caller's words
through a pager instead of relying on text. In effect, voice paging
technology serves as a portable answering machine. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In September Conxus Communications Inc. of Greenville, S.C.,
introduced Pocketalk a Motorola-built pager, in metropolitan
Boston. It can deliver and store up to three minutes of voice
messages or about a dozen 15-second messages. Unlike two-way
paging, however, there is no way of responding except for running
to a phone.
</P>
<P>
   Conxus is looking to reach business and residential customers
with its $49 voice pager and its $19.95-a-month service that offers
unlimited voice messages.
</P>
<P>
   ``With 80 percent of the nation's telephone households having
answering machines, we see a large potential market for a portable
device,'' said Julie K. Greene, vice president of marketing for
Conxus. The company says it has signed up 45,000 customers, mostly
on the East Coast, since it began shipping its units earlier this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Wireless voice messaging, however, has a checkered history. Take
the failure of Voicenow, a service from Dallas-based Paging Network
Inc., the nation's largest paging company. After investing $600
million in Voicenow, &UR;  &LR; the company &UR;  &LR; last year acknowledged &UR;  &LR; that
customers found the pager too large, the service too expensive, and
the geographical range for receiving voice messages too limited.
The company no longer actively promotes Voicenow.
</P>
<P>
   But two-way paging's boldest promise may lie in data more than
voice. Some carriers are developing new two-way services for
industrial use, such as electric or gas meter reading and home
security applications.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Such services could help the industry return to profitability,
achieve high profit margins, and reach customers willing to pay for
additional services in the form of software.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will still be company consolidations, but if we as an
industry are as successful with two-way paging as we think in
getting higher revenues and more growth, Wall Street will notice,''
said N. Ross Buckenham, president of Dallas-based Pagemart Wireless
Inc.

SCHUMER ATTACKS D'AMATO'S ENVIRONMENTAL INITIATIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES M. ODATO  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The Sierra Club and Rep. Charles Schumer slammed
the environmental record of Republican Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, who is
promoting an acid rain reduction bill aimed at cutting pollution in
the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Sierra Club and Schumer, a Democrat who is challenging
D'Amato in the race for U.S. Senate, said Tuesday that D'Amato's
election-year gimmickry can't mask his career of anti-environment
votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a classic case of election-year environmentalism,''
said Kathryn Hohmann of the Sierra Club.
</P>
<P>
   John Stouffer, legislative director of the club's Atlantic
Chapter, added that the acid rain bill sponsored by D'Amato and
Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., isn't as far-reaching as
necessary to control air pollution. Further, he said the bill did
not have a chance of passage during this congressional session _
meaning D'Amato could ignore it if he is re-elected.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato testified during a Senate hearing Tuesday that he wants
cleaner emissions from smoke stacks in Midwestern states, the
``airborne terrorism that must be stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato said his bill would lead to substantial reductions in
pollutants from coal-burning plants nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Stouffer said the positive sign from D'Amato can't wipe out
nearly two decades of bad votes by the Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Other environmental groups testified at the Senate hearing
supporting the proposed legislation, including The Adirondack
Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``We praise the efforts of Senators Moynihan and D'Amato on this
issue,'' said Timothy Burke, leader of the 18,000-member council.
</P>
<P>
   A D'Amato spokesman said Schumer is trying to politicize an
issue important to upstate New York. She also defended D'Amato's
environmental record, which includes working to increase the number
of buses with cleaner emissions.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, D'Amato's campaign released another ad about Schumer,
based on votes as long ago as 1975 when Schumer was a young state
Assemblyman. The ads suggest Schumer is no friend of upstate New
York.
</P>
<P>
   The ads depict the Brooklyn Democrat as a proponent of high
taxes while working to move education dollars to downstate schools
and blocking funds for upstate commuter air service.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer's campaign released the first positive ad of the general
election and shot down D'Amato's points as misleading.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the ads say Schumer has worked to cut air fares
upstate, to improve federal education spending, and he never voted
in favor of statewide property taxes but rather a measure to allow
local communities to raise taxes to pay for education.

AS THE ECONOMIC WORLD TURNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The world's emerging economies were slammed once again
in the July through September quarter, causing their stock markets
to lose half their value during the past year. Russia has lost
nearly all of its market value.
</P>
<P>
   Investors who ventured into faraway markets have learned, too
late, that it would've been best to keep their money at home.
Russia's bear market was let loose on a vulnerable world this fall,
and the financial damage spread to Europe and then Latin America.
Brazil's economy, just months ago the robust heart of Latin
America, is unstable. In a footnote to Asia's collapse a year ago,
Indonesia and Malaysia have been virtually closed off to Western
investors.
</P>
<P>
   These once-booming markets will surely recover. Cycles are the
law of capitalism, to which many of these ravaged countries still
aspire. But even experts are hard-pressed to divine when recovery
will come. It may be too early to predict, because it is unclear
whether the worst is over.
</P>
<P>
   How long will recovery take?
</P>
<P>
   ``A long time,'' said Nancy Kimelman, chief economist for
Thomson Global Markets, a Boston research firm. ``Did I say long? I
meant long.''
</P>
<P>
   Kimelman does not predict recovery before the year 2000: ``In
Asia, the improvements in the standard of living that took 20 or 30
years to build were erased in a year. That shows the depth and
magnitude of the contraction. It will be difficult for these
economies to come back.''
</P>
<P>
   The International Monetary Fund, in its semiannual report,
sharply reduced its forecast of world growth for 1998. The IMF,
which in May said world growth would be 3.1 percent this year,
trimmed its forecast to 2 percent. That compares with world growth
rates of 4.1 percent in both 1996 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main reason for this,'' explained the IMF's chief
economist, Michael Mussa, ``is the downturn in Asia, including
Japan, which has turned out to be significantly deeper and more
widespread than was anticipated'' five months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF's report may be optimistic: some economists fear
worldwide recession is unfolding. US job growth is slowing.
</P>
<P>
   The developing world's trouble in the latest quarter was
centered in Russia, and spread to Latin America as investors grew
nervous about all developing countries' prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's stock market, which had the &UR;  &LR; biggest gain of any
emerging stock market in 1997, lost about 90 percent amid
devaluation of the ruble and a near-collapse of the country's
economic infrastructure. The two worst performing funds in the
third quarter were Lexington Troika Russia, down 64.89 percent, and
Vontobel's Eastern European fund, down 40.48 percent, according to
Lipper Analytical Services Inc.'s quarterly report on mutual fund
returns.
</P>
<P>
   Diversified emerging markets funds, which may hold Russian
stocks, fell 23.57 percent in the quarter and 46.46 percent for the
year &UR;  &LR; ended Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
   Although Russia looms large politically, its economy is not as
important to the developed world as that of Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil is the primary concern of international economists. The
country, adhering firmly to its stable-currency stance, doubled
interest rates in September to slow the outflow of capital. The
government is now grappling with how to pay debts coming due as the
economy softens. If Brazil unravels, it could take a major trading
partner, Argentina, with it.
</P>
<P>
   Latin America-invested funds, which are half a world away from
Russia yet were shaken by that country's instability, plunged 29.4
percent in the quarter ended Sept. 30, Lipper reported. The funds
are down 50.2 percent in the past year.
</P>
<P>
   In Asia, a weak Japanese economy and teetering banking system
continued to sap nearby economies that do business with Japan or
borrow from its banks. For the quarter, Lipper reported
Japan-invested funds were down 9.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Single-digit losses in Asian markets in the recent quarter came
on top of huge declines in the prior period. China-based funds
declined 8.5 percent in the recent quarter. Funds invested in
Southeast Asia, excluding Japan, declined 6.6 percent. (Fund
performance is calculated in dollar terms.)
</P>
<P>
   ``With each month, the situation seems to have gotten worse and
each country has gotten sucked in,'' said Pierre Ellis, a managing
director in the New York office of Primark Decision Economics.
``It's very precarious. A lot of the world is already in great
difficulty. The rest is tied to the part of the world that is in
great difficulty.''
</P>
<P>
   US markets took their first real hit from a downturn that had
been contained in the developing world. US stock mutual funds
tracked by Lipper fell 15 percent in the third quarter, and there
is talk that a recession could follow.
</P>
<P>
   Although European economies have held up, stock markets were hit
hard just as the continent prepares for monetary union. Countries
such as Spain, a huge participant in Brazil's economy through its
banks, and Germany, which has ties to Russia, were punished by the
global meltdown. European funds fell 17.3 percent, but did not wipe
out gains posted over the past year.
</P>
<P>
   In predicting the turnaround time for emerging markets,
economists said the problems are more intractable than the currency
crises caused by the 1994 devaluation of Mexico's peso. The peso's
decline made exports more attractive on world markets and pulled
Mexico out of its slump in about 18 months. Although other Latin
American currencies fell, the crisis did not spread to Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``1994-95 had been preceded by several years of easy Fed policy.
They had supplied a lot of liquidity to us and to the world,''
Primark's Ellis said. ``But it was not the global slowdown that
seems to be happening now.''
</P>
<P>
   Confirming the Federal Reserve Board's concerns about the
breadth of the world's problem, chairman Alan Greenspan last week
reduced interest rates by a quarter point to improve liquidity not
just in this country but worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   But Daniel Peirce, head of emerging markets research for
BankBoston Corp., which operates in Brazil, sees plenty of
underlying strength in Latin America. Mexico and Argentina are
expected to grow more than 4 percent this year, while Brazil should
grow 1 percent; only Venezuela's economy will decline.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that it is difficult to have economic growth when
short-term interest rates in Mexico and Brazil are above 30
percent, Peirce believes long-term prospects are good because of
the huge progress in structural reforms of their economies and in
curbing corruption.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though there's all this market turmoil, they're still
moving on a very steady path of sound policies, sound monetary
policies, and sound fiscal policies,'' he said. ``You've got some
real live, breathing, genuine institutions'' in the region.
</P>
<P>
   As investors tote their second-quarter losses in the southern
hemisphere, Edward Bozaan, &UR;  &LR; president of Waterford Partners, a
boutique firm in New York that invests in emerging markets only
after they decline, is scouring the world for bargains. South
Korea's market is showing some benefits from concerted attempts at
bank reform. Thailand has rallied.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mood has definitely shifted, and we're hearing a lot of
fund managers starting to aggressively buy Thailand since they
can't buy Malaysia and they think Singapore is still going to
fall,'' Bozaan said.
</P>
<P>
   But professional investors and economists are crossing their
fingers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we focus just on Asia and hold that the world economy is
not going to fall off a cliff, there's a tenable macro (economic
argument) that says Asia could get out of its own way,'' said
Thomas Haslett, chief of emerging markets investment for
Boston-based Putnam Investments.
</P>
<P>
   Haslett avoided making near-term forecasts. ``I'm not saying
they're going to turn around on a dime. Every indication is
deflationary forces are at work,'' he said. ``But if you take a
medium-term view _ two or three years _ values have been created
through this meltdown.''
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, the dire condition of the world's second-biggest economy,
Japan, is key to recovery in Southeast Asia. This region's
fortunes, in turn, are key to the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese lawmakers in recent days agreed to steps to deal with a
banking crisis in reaction to criticism the country has papered
over the problems for a decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they do manage to reform their banking system, put more
fiscal stimulus in the pipeline, and stimulate monetary policy,
there is the prospect of an upturn next year,'' said Salomon Smith
Barney emerging markets strategist Brian Gendreau.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' Gendreau added, ``that's a lot of `ifs'.''

   MILAN, Italy _ The women's wear collections that usually are
most closely aligned with U.S. styles got under way this week with
wide swings of the fashion pendulum, from ultra-feminine to
ultra-utilitarian.
</P>
<P>
   Italian fashion generally mirrors styles American women choose,
including fine tailoring for career and sportswear and feminine
styles for evening and special-occasion dressing.
</P>
<P>
   The earliest Italian ready-to-wear collections for spring 1999,
however _ mostly designer secondary lines _ ranged from milkmaid
innocence to surfer chic to the blatantly sexual.
</P>
<P>
   Trends on runways have so far left audiences underwhelmed. Other
news, however, has left them breathless.
</P>
<P>
   Will Italian designers follow through with plans to show earlier
than U.S. designers next fall? Italian spring fashions could take
to the runways sometime around Labor Day, when women are still
wearing their spring and summer clothes.
</P>
<P>
   In today's shaky worldwide economy, will young or small design
houses be able to compete with giant fashion houses such as Calvin
Klein or Ralph Lauren? Will they even be able to survive? Fashion
followers in Milan expressed shock over the announced closing of
U.S. designer Isaac Mizrahi's business.
</P>
<P>
   One young line that appears to be doing just fine, grazie, is
Miu Miu, Prada's secondary line. For spring, designs revolve around
practical pouches and vests. And why shouldn't they? Prada is,
after all, a house whose recent phenomenal success has been
bankrolled by sales of industrial-strength accessories.
</P>
<P>
   For spring, a Miu Miu sleeveless vest, belted low on the chest,
can be removed and worn folded over the belt at the back waist in
the manner women have been tying sweaters about their waists. Other
pouches resembled zippered envelopes worn on wide belts that
resemble seatbelts.
</P>
<P>
   Colors fall into khaki and earth tones with lots of mossy green
and brown, with fabrics from crisp poplin shirting to buttery-soft
suede. Fabric ``shirts,'' zipped in front and with the look of
surfer Neoprene, top even the evening wear.
</P>
<P>
   Feminine touches on Miu Miu's utilitarian styles include ruffle
and tablecloth-fringe edging, short shorts and skinny walk shorts.
</P>
<P>
   D&AMP;G, another hip secondary line, took a detour from strictly
club clothes, albeit with some stretch-satin corset dresses, silver
and gold metallics, and tight black cire numbers that are now
considered almost classics in the line.
</P>
<P>
   Designed by Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana of Dolce &AMP;
Gabbana fame, D&AMP;G also includes sporty options of acid bright
stripes, cargo pants and pouch belts. Tops still run small over
straight-legged pants but are topped with hold-everything envelope
pouches for spring. These are designed to be worn bandoleer-style
(over one shoulder and under the opposite arm), an alternative to
the safety-minded practice of wearing backpacks as chest packs.
</P>
<P>
   One imagines a milking stool as an accessory to the innocent
cotton dresses of Philosophy di Alberta Ferretti. The secondary
line plays not only to a young client but also, for spring at
least, to anyone who covets crisp, cool and comfortable cottons.
</P>
<P>
   In bright white, khaki, black, brown and blue, cottons feature
oodles of pleats, tucks and ties and often run to ankle-length.
Cover-ups are the simplest of zippered leather jackets, and there
are nontraditional color schemes _ robin's-egg blue with brown, for
example.
</P>
<P>
   For evening, Ferretti chose duo-colored pinstripes on a white
background, often beading the stripes and adding sweater cover-ups.
The summer ballgown is black with a long quilted coat to top a long
sleeveless dress.
</P>
<P>
   At the opposite end of the fashion scale are Donatella Versace's
designs for Versus. With tops slit down the front from collarbone
to navel and beyond, or breasts bared by see-through striped knits,
these were beach or club clothes for ``la dolce vita.''
</P>
<P>
   The Versus show was staged in an abandoned warehouse in the
city's seedy Porta Genova area. Models stalked a runway created by
a purple liquid that oozed underfoot like globs in a Lava Lamp.
Thank heaven for the sleek, white, matte leather jackets that serve
as cover-ups for the sheers and Venetian-blind knits.
</P>
<P>
   Romeo Gigli, in his second season with new financial backers,
staged a return to the romantic looks that he does best.
</P>
<P>
   While he did incorporate plastic and net, he brought back his
signature shapes, such as the cocoon jacket that sparked a
long-lived trend in the '80s. &QL;

   RUSSIA-PROTEST _ MOSCOW _ Long-suffering Russians took to the
streets Wednesday amid the country's economic crisis in nationwide
protests full of anguish, but not anger. Thousands called for the
resignation of President Boris Yeltsin in the restrained and
peaceful marches. But their numbers did not match the expectations
of Communist Party and labor union leaders, who had predicted that
tens of millions would rally. The reason is plain, said a TV news
director in Vladivostok: No one believes in Yeltsin, but few
Russians believe in the opposition either. ``People understand the
uselessness of these actions. The union leaders and Communists are
left over from the Soviet period. That's why they couldn't get
their people out. People don't believe in such demonstrations.''

   JOURNAL-BARBADOS _ Barbados _ Compared to the rest of the
Caribbean, where a 9 a.m. appointment rarely begins before 10,
Barbados is the model of efficiency. The literacy rate of 97
percent is the region's highest, while murders are nearly
non-existent. Barbadians say their success is rooted in two places:
church and school. Here, in a country of 260,000, there are more
churches than days of the year. Schoolchildren even begin and end
their days with a prayer. Girls can't wear short skirts, while
disobedient boys are paddled. (Emling, Cox News Service).

   VOTERS _ In 1992 Ohio voters wanted change and they went to the
polls in the greatest numbers of the last 20 years. In that year
Ohio was a key state in Bill Clinton's winning the presidency. But
since then voter participation has dwindled, especially in
non-presidential election years. With Clinton mired in scandal,
some experts fear that the number of people who choose to vote this
year will be the lowest ever. That spells trouble for the
Democratic Party and perhaps for our form of government as well.
``What we are witnessing is a progressive meltdown in civic
engagement, a major danger to American democracy,'' said Curtis
Gans, director of the Committee for the Study of the American
Electorate, a not-for-profit public policy center. (Dempsey, Dayton

SURVEY SHOWS CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT DIVERSITY IN EDUCATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By VENISE WAGNER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A new survey indicates that Californians support
the notion of diversity in higher education and multicultural
educational programs, despite voter approval for the state's
anti-affirmative action initiative two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, released Tuesday by the Association of American
Colleges and Universities, found that 81 percent of those polled
believed universities and colleges should offer courses that help
students understand bigotry and its historical and contemporary
implications on U.S. society.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, sponsored by the Ford Foundation, polled 200
registered voters between July 14 and Aug. 4.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco State University President Robert Corrigan, a
member of the Association of American Colleges and Universities,
said the survey results indicate that Californians support
affirmative action even though 54 percent of California voters
approved Proposition 209 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are comfortable with supporting a diverse student
body,'' Corrigan said. ``People did not understand all the
implications of 209. Their support cannot be construed as an
anti-affirmative action mandate.''
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 209 banned preferences based on race or sex in state
contracting, hiring and admissions to public colleges and
universities.
</P>
<P>
   Corrigan said the survey numbers also indicated overwhelming
support for ethnic studies programs.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 80 percent of those polled agreed that the country's
shifting demographics make diversity education an imperative.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have done over the last 30 years is we've changed our
understanding of the nature of the past,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Genaro Padilla, vice chancellor at the University of California
at Berkeley and an association member, said scholarship in ethnic
studies had ``widened our thinking about encounters between
different groups. It's deepened our thinking about racial
relations.''
</P>
<P>
   Of those surveyed, 31 percent had household incomes of more than
$60,000. About 46 percent identified themselves as very
conservative to more conservative than liberal. Conversely, 38
percent described themselves as very liberal to more liberal than
conservative.
</P>
<P>
   The results can be projected to voters statewide with a 7.1
percent margin of error, but a 95 percent confidence level, the
authors of the survey said.
</P>
<P>
   The survey found that people like the idea of the college
campuses having ethnically and culturally diverse student bodies.
The survey did not explore the means by which such a goal should be
reached and would be acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the numbers may illuminate Californians' internal
conflict with wanting culturally and ethnically mixed student
populations without having to give anyone ``preferences,'' which
some argue affirmative action does.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if efforts to have a diverse student body have a more
positive or negative effect on students' education, 44 percent of
those surveyed said ``somewhat positive''; 26 percent answered
``very positive''; 20 percent responded ``negative.''
</P>
<P>
   But asked if education that emphasizes differences in cultures
breeds conflict, 46 percent said yes. And while 44 percent agreed
that said diversity in education was added just to make some
students feel included, 44 percent dismissed the notion that
diversity was used as an excuse to admit and graduate students who
otherwise wouldn't make it.
</P>
<P>
   Debra Humphreys, director of programs for the association, said
the results show that people are pragmatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know society is becoming diverse and that can bring
conflict,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, she said they support diversity programs
in higher education.
</P>
<P>
   ``They recognize the economic importance of this work so it's
not all from an altruistic point of view, that we should all get
along,'' she said.

 &HT;    A MAJOR, BUT MILD, PROTEST AS ECONOMIC CRISIS PERSISTS

   MOSCOW _ Long-suffering Russians, buffeted by their nation's
economic crisis, took to the streets Wednesday in nationwide
protests full of anguish, but not anger.
</P>
<P>
   In restrained and peaceful marches across Russia's 11 time
zones, hundreds of thousands called for the resignation of
President Boris Yeltsin and for billions of dollars in overdue
wages to be paid.
</P>
<P>
   But the numbers of protesters did not match the expectations of
Communist Party and labor union leaders, who had predicted as many
as 40 million Russians would demonstrate against declining living
conditions after the ruble crashed and the banking system collapsed
in August.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, thousands of Communist Party loyalists unfurled their
red Soviet-era flags, emblazoned with the hammer and sickle, and
marched to the Kremlin to call for Yeltsin's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   It was a scene repeated in cities and towns across Russia,
maintaining the pressure on the unpopular president who has been
unable to improve the post-Soviet economy.
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, the ranks of demonstrators came from the aging
die-hards of the Communist Party, students and working-class
Russians. The newly unemployed, especially the tens of thousands of
middle-class Muscovites, did not show up as organizers had hoped.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin, 67, his authority diminished since the crisis erupted
in August, spent what his spokesman called a ``normal working day''
at his office behind the thick Kremlin walls.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the friend of the financial magnates and the bankers and
bosses. He's their friend, not ours,'' said protester Pavel
Kostayetsky, 58, a Moscow biochemist whose salary equals about $100
a month since the ruble's 60 percent decline in value over the last
two months.
</P>
<P>
   In the Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk, nationalist Alexander
Lebed, the regional governor and a presidential aspirant, also
called for Yeltsin to step down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today Yeltsin is alone,'' said Lebed. ``People are pushed to
the extreme. Western investors have become fierce and are angry
with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Some protesters carried large photos of Soviet founder Vladimir
Lenin beside Yeltsin, with Yeltsin's face stamped with a large red
X.
</P>
<P>
   Irina Norvelyka, 52, an unemployed trading company manager from
Moscow, participated in her first public demonstration since the
Soviet Union collapsed in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   She lost her job in a similar economic crash in 1994. This time,
her life savings of about $1,600 was frozen in a bank that has
closed its doors. She wonders if she'll ever see it again.
</P>
<P>
   ``There should have been economic reforms, instead there was
theft,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Across Russia, some media estimates put the turnout Wednesday at
nearly 1 million, though the Kremlin said only about 600,000
attended the demonstrations. Thousands of police and interior
ministry troops were deployed to keep order.
</P>
<P>
   A similar day of protests last year drew an estimated 2 million
people.
</P>
<P>
   A television news director in the eastern port of Vladivostok
explained the low turnout: No one believes in Yeltsin, but few
Russians believe in the opposition either after years of political
and economic upheaval, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People understand the uselessness of these actions. The union
leaders and Communists are left over from the Soviet period. That's
why they couldn't get their people out. People don't believe in
such demonstrations,'' Valery Bakshin, director of TV-Radio
Vladivostok, said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   The Communist Party has been forced to temper its antagonism
against the government since endorsing Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov's appointment last month.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov has included Communist officials in his cabinet and
given them a leading role in formulating economic policy, though a
plan to deal with the crisis has yet to be announced.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the economy has not improved.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very simple to blame someone else for our problems, but
we're all to blame,'' said Sergei Chalyeanhe, deputy chairman of
the 152,000-member municipal workers union in Moscow. ``After 70
years of Soviet rule, the country inherited a heavy load of
problems and the government has not been able to improve people's
lives.''

   BRANDED-FURNITURE (Undated) _ ``Branding'' _ attaching a name or
trademark to a product to give it an aura of value and a sales hook
_ is familiar strategy to fashion, luxury goods and entertainment.
But it is about to hit consumers where they sit. And the pitch has
got an odd new role-call, with famous names from the four corners
of the cultural map, Coca Cola to Greta Garbo and Ernest Hemingway.
By William L. Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   JERDE-ARHITECTURE (Undated) _ ``Jon Jerde,'' Steve Wynn declared
grandly, ``is the Bernini of our time.'' And, he continued, ``these
are the cathedrals of our time. This is the future of
architecture.'' The ``cathedrals'' touted by Wynn _ a pontiff of
the material world _ are Disneyland, the Mall of America and his
own casino extravaganza, Bellagio, due to open next week in Las
Vegas, Nev. All three are landmarks of the trend for fusing
architecture, commerce and fantasy, of which Jerde is a pioneer. By
Frances Anderton.

<P>
   TOY-BALLS (Undated) _ With a Super Bowl victory to his credit at
last, pro quarterback John Elway holds another record, widely
publicized by the OddzOn toy company. He has thrown the finned
Koosh Vortex Mach 110 more than 110 yards. OddzOn began as the
maker of the Koosh ball. Today, as part of toy giant Hasbro, it
belongs to the same family as its distant rival Nerf. Together,
Koosh and Nerf are building better balls - and the guns to fire
them. Both Nerf, the ball of one generation, and Koosh, that of the
next, quickly evolved into other products - hoops for backboards
and bedroom-closet doors, for instance. By Phil Patton.
</P>
<P>
   PARIS-PHONE-KIOSKS (Paris) _ Blues in the night. A purple heart
for the lovelorn. Peter Eisenman's new design for a Parisian
telephone kiosk is oddly poignant, coming from an architect noted
for such cold-blooded formal explorations as the Wexner Center for
the Arts in Columbus, Ohio, and that city's convention center, with
its metal roof that undulates like a bed of snakes. Commissioned by
J.C. Decaux, the French firm best known for deluxe sidewalk pay
toilets, the kiosk is one of several prototypes being considered
for placement throughout the city. Designs are also being submitted
by Norman Foster, Jean Nouvel, Charles Gwathmey, Robert A.M. Stern,
James Stewart Polshek, and Tod Williams and Billie Tsien. Decaux
plans to eventually distribute 5,000 of the kiosks, perhaps in a
mix of designs. By Herbert Muschamp.
</P>
<P>
   PARIS-CHEAP-FURNITURE (Paris) _ I arrived in Paris with two
suitcases and soon learned how to live among other people's things,
in a rented room decorated with Japanese white paper lanterns and
nondescript plasterboard shelves. By the time I graduated to my own
studio, I had the requisite bed, desk and couch from Ikea, but I
needed everything else. Determined to fill the apartment with
Parisian treasures, I ruled out the notoriously overpriced Left
Bank antique stores and Parisian flea markets like the Marche aux
Puces at Porte de Clignancourt. Instead, I began at the flea
market's poorer cousins, the brocantes, which are less publicized
roving antiques fairs. Like Parisians, most brocantes head south
for the summer, but they are back in full flower for the rentree in
the fall. By Kristin Hohenadel.

SPENDTHRIFT U.S. DOES BETTER THAN THRIFTY JAPAN 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BERNARD D. KAPLAN  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ In the 1970s and '80s, economists wagged an admonishing
finger at Americans for saving too little money and argued that
they should follow the example of the Japanese, who saved far more
than they spent.
</P>
<P>
   The economists claimed that Japan's thriftiness was the key to
the enormous strides that had turned it into America's major
economic challenger. Instead of wasting cash on expensive gadgets
they did not need, the prudent Japanese put their money into bank
deposits and corporate shares, thus bolstering the national economy
as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   The government, meanwhile, helped the process along by making
Japanese consumer goods, including housing, so highly priced that
few people were tempted to spend more than absolutely necessary.
The one big exception was on foreign travel. But that was because
Japanese tourists could get around with less abroad than at home.
</P>
<P>
   Now this theory appears to have been seriously flawed.
</P>
<P>
   Their penchant for not spending enough of what they earn has
driven the Japanese to the wall.
</P>
<P>
   During the past few years, as the Tokyo stock market slumped and
banks crashed, the average Japanese spent even less than
previously. So, of course, the country's domestic economy sank
further into the doldrums.
</P>
<P>
   Now a desperate government has unveiled a proposal to give each
citizen ``gift vouchers'' worth $225 _ provided they're spent
within a specified time. A similar scheme was suggested in
California during the Great Depression of the 1930s, but it failed
to win voter approval. Tokyo's plan offers some idea of how
distraught the Japanese have become.
</P>
<P>
   It also reflects the fact that some of our favorite theories of
recent times have burst at the seams under the shock of the
dramatic reversal in the worldwide economic outlook that is
currently taking place.
</P>
<P>
   Saving may be no guarantee against a slump if, as in Japan, the
practice hinders normal free-market activities. Americans, who
spend while they have the cash, may wind up better off than the
Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the long-held and comforting belief that august
institutions like the International Monetary Fund have done away
with the threat of financial panics has proved to be a chimera. The
IMF showed at its conference with the World Bank in Washington this
week that it has run out of fresh ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Seldom has economics, known as the ``dismal science,'' looked
more dismal and less scientific than it does right now.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton may sincerely think that a few billion more
dollars furnished to the IMF would cushion or even end the crisis.
Good luck to him. But he is wrong.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Your tousle-haired 10-year-old has just told you to buzz off
when you tell him _ for the third time _ to turn off the TV and set
the dinner table.
</P>
<P>
   Your first impulse is to swat him. Your second is to banish him
to his room for a week. The last thing you, as a parent, want to do
is empathize with the little brat and talk through the impasse with
him.
</P>
<P>
   Yet that is exactly what child psychologist Ross Greene suggests
you do, if you have a child who is known in the professional
lexicon as difficult or oppositional. What Greene counsels parents
to do is divert such children from even worse behavior (a violent
meltdown), by using empathy, logic, and judiciously applied
compromise. Punishing a child like this for swearing, he says, will
only make matters worse.
</P>
<P>
   Greene's approach to taming what he calls the ``explosive
child'' is a radical departure from the standard strategies for
dealing with disruptive children, and he is the first to admit that
this new approach won't make him popular among many parents or
other mental health professionals.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are parents and teachers who say I'm going to spoil kids
with my approach,'' says Greene, who spells it all out in a
detailed new book called ``The Explosive Child.'' ``After all, it's
the way most of us were raised, with punishment and rewards, and
it's hard to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Greene is quick to acknowledge that rewards and punishment, when
done properly, are effective with most disruptive children. Such
children, after all, are the majority; specialists estimate that
only between 2 and 16 percent of all children fall into the
category of explosive, and the majority of those are boys. It's
these explosive children for whom the conventional strategies don't
work, Greene argues, and a more nuanced approach is necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Many psychologists would take issue with him.
</P>
<P>
   These children do not know how to express themselves, and ``they
don't learn a lot from talking about their behavior,'' says Thomas
Phelan, a Chicago-area psychologist who has refined the ``1-2-3
Magic'' formula, which involves counting to 3 when children are
misbehaving and giving them an automatic timeout if the count
reaches 3.
</P>
<P>
   Phelan lectures to parents around the country, winning quick
converts to his formula wherever he goes. He has little patience
with mental health professionals like Greene, who attempt a more
complicated approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to dig a hole and jump in it, you can discuss
things with these kids,'' says Phelan, who is himself the father of
a hyperactive child. ``But it doesn't work; you need something
where you're drawing the line.''
</P>
<P>
   Greene, of course, has heard this all before _ from skeptical
parents and colleagues at Massachusetts General Hospital, where he
works. So when a reporter also challenges him on his technique,
asking whether it's really such a good idea to compromise on
important issues, such as whether a child should be allowed a
sleep-over on a school night, Greene doesn't even sigh. He smiles
to himself, sits farther back in his chair, and calmly explains his
philosophy one more time.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not giving in, this is parents proposing a problem and
helping a child collaborate on a solution,'' Greene says. ``Look at
this way: What's more important, blind adherence to authority or
resolving conflict?''
</P>
<P>
   Ross Greene is nothing if not persuasive. But beyond those
powers of persuasion and an endearing lack of defensiveness, it is
easy to see why Greene gets along so well with troubled children
and desperate parents: At first glance, he looks like a child
himself, with an elfish grin, a mop of curly dark hair, and warm
brown eyes.
</P>
<P>
   But at age 40, Greene has been working with troubled youths for
almost 20 years, and his experience shows, in the self-assured way
in which he fields critical queries. And it doesn't hurt that by
the time most parents arrive at his office, a tiny and rather
sterile cubicle near the summit of Mass. General's ambulatory care
tower, they are ready to try anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's walking in the door are people who've learned that
teaching the kid who's boss isn't working,'' says Greene, who grew
up in Miami, the well-behaved middle child of parents who did make
clear who was boss. ``They're already so frustrated they're open to
something different.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of these parents, keep in mind, have children who are at
the extreme end of the behavioral spectrum. These are not kids who,
after whining how unfair it is they have to go to bed, will
eventually capitulate in the face of persistent threats. (``You are
going to timeout if you don't get up the stairs this instant.'')
</P>
<P>
   These are children who go from flat resistance to a parental
request _ ``No, I won't!'' _ to an outright meltdown in a matter of
minutes, screaming, cursing, throwing things, even destroying
property and (occasionally) attacking people physically. They don't
melt down all the time, of course, and some of these children may
lose control only with their parents and not in school, but when
they do, it's a horrifying sight.
</P>
<P>
   It's also dangerous, to themselves and to others around them.
Greene says some of the children he has worked with are suicidal,
and a few have threatened to hurt other people. In the most extreme
scenario, a child who shares this profile and is not given the help
he needs could become the next Kip Kinkel, the 15-year-old Oregon
boy who shot his own parents to death and then walked into his
local high school and killed two of his classmates, wounding dozens
of others.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are easily frustrated kids who become antagonistic
toward their parents and other adults, and they can become very
alienated,'' Greene says. ``Alienation expresses itself in many
ways, and it could lead to a kid walking into school and shooting
somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   While most people would look at a teenager like Kinkel and see
an antisocial loser who became violent to get his way, Greene sees
the kind of child who, often because of inherited problems
(attention deficit disorder, learning disability, Tourette's
syndrome) is easily frustrated, has a difficult time shifting
gears, and just doesn't know how to react in a more civilized way.
</P>
<P>
   On Page 30 of his new book, Greene sums up the mindset of these
children in a cartoon showing a dog being directed to sit by his
master. And the dog is thinking, ``I may want to sit. Just give me
a chance to process this.''
</P>
<P>
   If these children are pushed too hard before they can process
the new command, they explode. ``When your child explodes, you
can't talk to him,'' says a Boston educator whose 12-year-old son
suffers from Tourette's syndrome and has been explosive all his
life. ``It's like trying to break up a bar fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Greene makes a distinction between the child who throws a
``coherent'' tantrum _ he stops when he notices his mother isn't in
the room anymore and then starts up again when he finds her _ and
children who throw ``incoherent'' tantrums _ ``they go crazy and
really lose it,'' whether or not the mother is still there.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more I worked with these disruptive kids, the more I
became convinced that their oppositional behavior is
unintentional,'' Greene says. ``Parents think the kids are just
doing it to yank their chain; but they usually aren't throwing
tantrums on purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   For the many children who are throwing tantrums on cue, the
standard system of rewards and punishment may indeed be very
effective. A parent who consistently sets limits on misbehavior
through a strategy like 1-2-3 timeout, should be successful in
eradicating tantrums in time, Greene and other psychologists agree.
</P>
<P>
   But for the children Greene sees, the standard strategies have
failed, and that has a lot to do with their brain chemistry. A
unique chemistry explains why medications are often part of the
solution, Greene says: Ritalin for attention deficit disorder,
Prozac for depression, Risperadone or clonadine for Tourette's
syndrome. But in many cases, medication is not sufficient to turn
the tide.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are children whom I couldn't work with, without
medications,'' observes Greene, as a rare cognitive therapist in a
child psychiatry department known to rely on drugs for assistance.
``But medication is frequently not the sole answer to a child's
problems, and in some cases, it isn't meeting their needs at all.''
</P>
<P>
   What Greene does, with the parents he advises and in his book,
is to provide a detailed road map for parents to follow before
their child melts down. If it's time for 9-year-old Sally to get
ready for bed, Greene suggests that instead of demanding that Sally
come inside or face punishment, a parent might stay calm in the
face of deafening resistance and say, ``Whoa, slow down. I don't
really think this is one to get all upset about. I may actually be
willing to compromise about this if you could chill a little.'' And
then the parent could discuss with Sally ways to reach a mutually
satisfactory compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Greene recommends this kind of negotiation in all but
circumstances where the child's safety is at stake. For instance,
parents would decide that some behaviors, such as riding a bike
without a helmet, are never acceptable and thus nonnegotiable. But
with an explosive child, at least initially, all other behaviors,
even ones that most parents cling to, such as getting homework done
by bedtime, should be left open to compromise, in an effort to
avert meltdowns.
</P>
<P>
   When this approach is applied consistently by parents, teachers,
and other adults in the child's world, Greene says he has seen even
the most explosive child learn to temper his behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Parents who have worked with Greene agree, with the fervor of
born-agains.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our son is as explosive as ever, but the frequency of his
explosions has diminished considerably,'' says the mother of the
boy with Tourette's. ``This strategy has worked as well as
anything, but boy, was it hard to do. We had to give up every
sacred cow of parenthood.''
</P>
<P>
   And there's the rub, some say. The approach outlined in Greene's
book may eventually be effective, for some children some of the
time, but it requires a superhuman effort by parents. After all,
when a child calls you a ``(expletive)-poor excuse for parents,''
how many parents can curb their tendency to roar back?
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Greene insists the majority of parents he has worked with are
able to achieve this paradigm shift in behavior. Even so, Greene,
who is now the father of a 2-year-old himself, considers himself
fortunate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we lucked out,'' he says. ``Our daughter has a sweet
temperament.''

SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT FINDS DIVERSE FORCE WORKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM HERRON ZAMORA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In an effort to recruit more female deputies,
Sheriff Michael Hennessey once sent letters to every member of the
San Francisco Women's Rugby League urging them to apply.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked at that (mailing) list and thought here are some
women who don't mind mixing it up,'' Hennessey said. ``We got two
employees out of that mailing who probably wouldn't have applied.
It was worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   That was one of many recruiting efforts Hennessey cited Tuesday
as responsible for making the San Francisco Sheriff's Department
perhaps the most diverse urban law enforcement agency in the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   The 713 sheriff's deputies are 65 percent non-white and 22
percent female _ higher ratios than any other big-city law
enforcement agency, according to Hennessey's office.
</P>
<P>
   The report compares the Sheriff's Department to the San
Francisco Police Department and 11 other law enforcement agencies
throughout the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The only other agency that had fewer than 50 percent white
officers was the Los Angeles Police Department, with 49 percent.
Hennessey's department was also the only agency with women making
up more than 20 percent of its staff.
</P>
<P>
   The increased diversity of the Sheriff's Department has come
with little of the controversy and bitterness that accompanied
efforts to integrate the police and fire departments in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Both those departments spent nearly 20 years being monitored by
the federal courts after the city settled discrimination suits in
the 1970s by adopting consent decrees to encourage integration.
Last Friday, a judge lifted the federal consent decree from the
Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had no lawsuits. ... We've never had a consent decree,''
Hennessey said. ``We've been able to do this without any
opposition. ... It wasn't a forced issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Al Waters, president of the San Francisco Deputy Sheriffs'
Association, agreed. ``We have never had to fight any of those
battles. That doesn't mean that everything has been perfect. But
we've never had that kind of dispute. ... We've never had issues of
that magnitude.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, unions representing officers in the San Francisco
Police Department have challenged every round of promotions in that
department for 20 years, accusing management of reverse
discrimination against white male officers. Meanwhile, many black
police officers found themselves at odds with their own union.
</P>
<P>
   Waters said that is not a problem in the Deputy Sheriffs'
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Although the rank and file in the Sheriffs' Department has not
always agreed with the promotional process, ``we've never had a
protest of the promotional exam based on race or gender,'' Waters
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at our Asians, look at our Hispanics, look at people who
are gay and lesbian, you see everyone reflected in this union,''
Waters said. ``There are a lot of different communities who are
comfortable in our ranks.''
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco, sheriff's deputies operate the city jail,
provide security at the courts and handle evictions. Most other law
enforcement duties _ such as responding to 911 calls and
investigating crimes _ are handled by the police.
</P>
<P>
   Both Hennessey and Waters agreed that it is important to have
jailers who, to some decree, are as diverse as the inmates.
</P>
<P>
   ``From my perspective of running jails, it is going to run
better if you have people who somewhat reflect the population
inside,'' Hennessey said. ``It reduces tension and it's safer for
everyone.''

   SCI-LIZARD-RAFT (Undated) _ Fifteen iguanas on a tangle of
waterlogged trees, tossed into the Caribbean Sea by a hurricane,
have apparently sailed 200 miles from Guadaloupe to Anguilla,
scientists reported today. Their report has wowed a community of
scientists that has been arguing since early in this century about
whether such journeys were even remotely possible, let alone
observable. By documenting the voyage of fifteen large, land-loving
creatures _ enough to form a new population _ the study provides
the first clear-cut evidence in support of those biologists who
argue that seemingly impossible journeys like this could be

IT'S ALL IN THE MIX
</HEADLINE>
  (af)  
 By MICHEL MARRIOTT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For years Josh Gabriel, a musician and computer programmer, had
looked for a way to make composing and recording music as simple
for the average person as desktop publishing had made producing
newsletters and brochures.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, anyone wanting to make music had to learn to play
an instrument or be lucky enough to have a pleasing singing voice.
And even becoming an entertaining rapper required talent and
practice and a DJ, someone who mixed music on increasingly
expensive and complicated equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to let people actually get their own hands on
music,'' said Gabriel.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago he helped to form Mixman Technologies in San
Francisco and began the work of building just such an enabling
technology. What he came up with and delivered to retail shelves
last Christmas was Mixman Studio. It is a software package that
creates on a personal computer a self-contained recording studio
and a real-time mixer.
</P>
<P>
   The mixer, which is the heart of the application, has undergone
two refinements. The latest version, which includes a sound-effects
studio and editing capacity, is scheduled to go on sale next month.
All of the mixers resemble a three-dimensional view of a hip-hop
DJ's dual turntables. Any wav file, the common means of digitally
storing sound in PCs, can be loaded into Mixman.
</P>
<P>
   Gabriel's company also sells enhanced music CDs that are packed
with hundreds of prerecorded samples, or clips, of music. The clips
can be taken from the CDs once they are placed in a CD-ROM drive
much the way clip art is copied from CD-ROMs.
</P>
<P>
   Gabriel, who is vice president and creative director of Mixman
Technologies, added that his company buys the rights to the musical
samples, some from well-known artists like George Clinton and
Naughty By Nature. That makes the sound clips royalty-free to
constomers.
</P>
<P>
   Once these clips _ actually short loops of musical phrases, such
as bass lines, synthesizer cords, vocal tracks, percussion, guitar
licks and sound effects _ are placed with a mouse click into Mixman
they become represented on the mixer by a letter or number. Hold
down the `I' key, for instance, and as long as it is depressed the
sound of a drum playing is heard.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the 16 keys call up musical sounds, each synchronized to
play together in key and tempo. The samples can be layered in or
out as the user wishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to sort of open the door for the average person into
the thought processes behind making music,'' said Gabriel. ``People
want more customization. This is customization of music down to the
molecular level.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mixman, which is scheduled to appear also in a Mac version
in December, has its limitations. Creating music with complex
harmonic structures is practically impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Gabriel acknowledged that Mixman is best suited for creating
highly rhythmic music that tends to depend heavily on repetitious
elements, like hip-hop, house and raggae music often do.
</P>
<P>
   While some musicians have rejected the idea of inviting
listeners to remix their finished work, others, said Gabriel, have
welcomed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They understand that there is something to having a fan
appreciate in a deeper way what the artist is doing by letting them
into the work,'' he said. A limited version of Mixman Studio can be
downloaded free at www.mixman.com. The retail version costs $49.95;
the deluxe model, Mixman Studio Pro, with sound effects and editing
additions, is scheduled to be in stores in November for around
$119, said Gabriel who plays his Mixman as if it were a musical
instrument.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea,'' he said while he mixed tracks without looking at
his computer keyboard, '' is to bring music, interactive music, to
the masses.''

TODDLERS' TOOLS WITHOUT THE RING OF TRUTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By J.C. HERZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is virtual. And then there is fake.
</P>
<P>
   The Tonka Workshop is fake.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, it is a plastic play set that straps onto a
keyboard so children 3 and older can use ``tools'' when prompted by
a CD-ROM character named Tonka Joe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Using the (italics)actual(end italics) plastic hammer,
spray-paint can or screwdriver,'' the press release explains,
``kids control virtual tools in a world full of building and
exploring on the computer screen. The unique play set lets kids
work on several projects, from robots to toy houses and spaceships.
They'll sharpen their tool skills at the Tool Olympics and use
their tools to discover the mysteries of the Junk Shop. Once
they've earned their Master Tool license, they're ready to hop in
the Tonka Workshop van and head out to virtual, on-site fix-it
missions.''
</P>
<P>
   Let's talk about tools for a second. A tool is a way of
channeling energy to shape or change an object, be it real or
virtual. A hammer is a tool. Scissors are a tool. A word processor
is a tool. Hypertext markup language is a tool. There are tools
that work in a virtual environment, but there is no such thing as a
virtual tool. A plastic drill that depresses the Caps Lock key is
not a tool. It isn't virtual. It's fake.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, we've been giving fake tools to children for years.
Plastic hammers for boys, plastic ovens for girls. But we have
never given them the idea that fake tools could accomplish real
tasks. And that is the underlying assumption of this toy.
</P>
<P>
   You select a project from the on-screen Drawing Board, where all
the projects have been conveniently drawn for you. In this
universe, construction requires no planning, and you're not allowed
to design anything yourself. Then Tonka Joe says, in a voice eerily
reminiscent of Phil Hartman's, ``Since you're so good with tools,
you do the building while I read the instructions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Cut out the pieces for the sled with your saw.'' So you jerk
the plastic saw back and forth. The Close Bracket key goes up and
down a few times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now use your socket wrench to bolt the runners to your sled.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A coat of paint from your sprayer, and your sled will be ready
for the hill!'' Three keystrokes later, voila, a purple sled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nice work!''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is, the sled isn't ready for the hill. It isn't even
ready for a digital hill. It's ready to be printed out. But that's
all. And in the process, you've learned that using tools like saws
and socket wrenches doesn't require any sort of real skill and that
elbow grease does not exist (in this world, sanding is a matter of
toggling the ``plane'' from side to side for about six seconds).
Paint dries instantly, and Undo negates everything.
</P>
<P>
   In the Storage Shed, you can create your own ``surprise
sculptures,'' but the only choice is the ``material'' you're going
to use: wood, metal or stone. Once selected, a hunk of the stuff
magically appears. ``Grab a tool,'' Tonka Joe yells, ``and start
chipping away!''
</P>
<P>
   But it doesn't matter if you use a hammer or a drill, a socket
wrench or a saw. All the tools do the same thing. They make
chipping noises while bits of the block fly off, revealing ... a
concrete gorilla! A wooden cabinet! A jungle gym, chipped from
solid stainless steel with a spray can.
</P>
<P>
   After that, you can move on to the Tool Challenge, where the
object is to pull the plastic saw back and forth as fast as you can
for 30 seconds. ``You earned a medal on the scoreboard!'' Tonka Joe
declares. ``The most skilled craftsman can win all six!''
</P>
<P>
   The child is given no choice here, no goal, no understanding of
what's going on or why. This software doesn't just fail to simulate
real-world tools; it actually makes a mockery of tools. It mocks
the notion of craftsmanship. It mocks the idea that skill is
necessary in any context or that you would even want to know how
things are made.
</P>
<P>
   Milk comes from cartons, and software comes from disks that
prompt you to click Next, Next and Finish. No need to understand.
It's magic.
</P>
<P>
   That is an infantile attitude. And it's almost forgivable when
you're dealing with a computer operating system. But it's appalling
when you're dealing with a hammer because even 3-year-olds can
understand a hammer and what it does, and how, and why. Even
3-year-olds can build things and understand tools and materials,
and what it means to struggle with and master them.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't matter whether the tools and materials are physical
or virtual, crayons or Play-Doh or Lincoln Logs or digital paint
software. The task is real, and the lessons are real. The skills
outlast the project.
</P>
<P>
   And even if the end result is taken apart or deleted or smushed,
it has given a kid the chance to be creative and self-expressive.
None of that is possible with this product. The most creative thing
a kid can do with Tonka Joe's ``projects'' is print them out (in
black and white), color them in, then run and say, ``Hey, Mom, look
at this doghouse I ... printed out.''
</P>
<P>
   When we're adults, there is time enough to be helpless and
ignorant about how our tools work. We should at least let our kids
be capable and knowledgeable as long as they possibly can, while
they're still innocent enough to know what they're doing.

LOG ON, ROCK ON DAVE STEWART SINGS, WRITES ON-LINE INVITING HIS
AUDIENCE TO COLLOBORATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MICHEL MARRIOTT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It has been more than a decade since Dave Stewart, the bearded
half of the 80s electro-pop duo the Eurythmics, made himself and
Annie Lennox into international darlings of a fledging music video
medium that gave birth to MTV.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Stewart, who at 46 appears no less the determined musician
of his younger days, is once again teasing at the creative edges of
yet another emerging mass medium: the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Stewart helped to start an Internet site he calls
the Sly-Fi Network. The site's logo is a pair of
retro-techno-styled headphones that Stewart, who has a flare for
the whimsical, sometimes wears. The wacky headphones also grace the
cover of his new album, aptly named ``Sly-Fi,'' some of which can
be heard on the network's Sly-Fi Hi-Fi section; the album is
distributed and sold only on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Stewart, not wearing the headphones, did a cybercast
on his site from an 18th-century church turned recording studio in
London. He did appear with his British working-class brogue and
swept-back blond hair, inventing a new song and, as always,
reinventing himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always sort of like got my ear to the ground and
listening for how things are progressing,'' Stewart said in a
recent telephone interview from his studio in London. One of the
things he has taken particular notice of has been the Internet, the
``first place,'' he says, ``that I've ever felt that I really
belong.''
</P>
<P>
   While some others fear that the Internet's vast computer network
will ultimately isolate people at their keyboards, Stewart said he
is convinced that quite the opposite is more likely. ``To me it's a
brilliant opening up of the world,'' he said of cyberspace in
general.
</P>
<P>
   As if to prove his point, Stewart, who long ago acquired a
reputation as an artful tinkerer with new technologies, helped to
create the Sly-Fi Network (www.slyfi.com or www.davestewart.com) to
involve people in his music and art, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Far from being just another online rock star fan club, the site
_ part of Stewart's deal with Digital Artists, a new label at N2K
Encoded Music, which is part of a major online entertainment
company, N2K Inc. _ is designed to be a gathering point for
artistic adventure.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart says the site, or network as he calls it, is aiming at
nothing less than establishing alternative means of artistic
freedom, expression and collaboration.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, major recording artists, most notably David Bowie
and the artist formerly known as Prince, have been expanding the
boundaries of what musicians can do with the Internet. In that
spirit, Stewart, a singer, song writer, producer, photographer,
filmmaker, screenwriter and lecturer who has worked on projects
with people as diverse as Bob Dylan and Kevin Spacey, said he wants
to test those boundaries even further on his network. He calls it
his ``multimedia playground.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What gets him excited, and me too, with this medium is that it
absolutely has no rules,'' said Nick Turner, vice president of
N2K's Music Boulevard Network, West Coast. ``With this medium you
make up the rules as you go along. It is so free to experiment and
try things.''
</P>
<P>
   In an instance several weeks ago, Stewart trained a video camera
on his studio for 24 hours, giving anyone linked to his site a
desktop view into his world. Pushing the technology much further,
he recently invited people to help him write a song over the
Internet. He posted only the name of the song-to-be, ``Get Over
Yourself,'' and the date and time when he would begin the
collaboration on line.
</P>
<P>
   What followed was a live cybercast from his London studio, which
he has dubbed Sly-Fi Mission Control. Reminiscent of the packed BBC
studio where the Beatles' ``All You Need Is Love'' was broadcast in
the late 1960s, Stewart's studio was similarly crammed with people
joining in on the music making.
</P>
<P>
   And you didn't have to be there. He received e-mail from as far
away as Japan as suggestions about lyrics and digital beats for the
song-in-progress streamed into the studio. And as the cybercast
went on for hours, Stewart dutifully read, edited and incorporated
lyrics that spilled out of his computer's printer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was a great, interesting experience in the world
being connected,'' Stewart said. ``It is amazing to have people in
the world joining in on something.'' After he finished the song, he
made it freely available on his network.
</P>
<P>
   He said he decided to give the song away because so many people
helped to write it that it would be impossible to credit everyone
responsible for it.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart's site also offers two software programs, Res Rocket and
Mixman Studio, that encourage online visitors to get yet more
directly involved in his music.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Res Rocket, designed more for professional musicians, permits
people in different locations to plug in their MIDI-enabled
instruments and play together on line and in real time _ a musical
teleconference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine,'' Stewart said, ``if you were a kid and you live in
some town in Alaska and you want to be in a band, but none of your
friends play the bass.'' With Res Rocket, which can be downloaded
from his site, he said the same youngster could be ``jamming with
somebody who lives in New Orleans.'' The other program, Mixman
Studio, permits a more solitary interaction with Stewart's music.
</P>
<P>
   Mixman is a real-time sound mixer that can splice and blend up
to 16 samples of music at a time, resulting in a piece of original
recorded music. Stewart supplies 16 samples of some of the music on
his new album, including bass lines, vocal tracks, keyboard cords
and percussion. By using the program, a computer keyboard becomes a
kind of mixing board, its makers say.
</P>
<P>
   But will such technological gadgetry destroy the soul of the
music?
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, whose trademark production style often blended what he
characterized as ``weird hybrids'' like a drum machine and a
symphonic orchestra, says absolutely not.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's what you do with it,'' he said. ``I remember when
synthesizers came out and people said, `Oh, it's the death of rock
and roll.' And then when CDs came out, `Oh, that's the end.' Now
the Internet and people say, `That's the end, nobody will be able
to talk anymore.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart said he is, through his music and Sly-Fi, proving wrong
the skeptics of the marriage of music and the Internet. Next he
plans to hold a kind of song-writing tutorial on line. ``I'll
answer people's questions on line about songs that I have
written,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, he is showing the music video for the album's
first single, a dark but upbeat autobiographical song called
``Happy To Be Here.'' The video can also be found on a tour of
Stewart's virtual apartment. That can be found on his music CD
itself when the disk is placed in a computer's CD-ROM drive.
</P>
<P>
   (Hint: the music video is in his television set).
</P>
<P>
   Candy Dulfer, the Dutch-born fusion jazz saxophonist, said she
was not surprised that Stewart invited the world into his creative
processes.
</P>
<P>
   After years of collaborating with him the old-fashioned way, in
brick-and-mortar studios, she said she discovered that he was
``just that kind of person,'' adding: ``Every time I'm there he
seems to have new and exciting things happening and it's all about
the music,'' said Ms. Dulfer, whose first big hit, ``Lilly Was
Here'' in 1989 was a collaboration with Stewart on a movie
soundtrack he had done for a European film with the same name.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sly-Fi to me is kind of a diary, an extract of things that I
am doing in my life,'' Stewart explains in a video interview stored
on his site. He added, ``it's something that you would come across
on the Net and say, `What the hell is that?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Already, Stewart has released a frenetic short film he made for
the Sly-Fi TV section of the network. In quick-cut style, the film
sweeps through original images that include an Eurythmics montage,
scenes of Timothy Leary's house where he was a frequent guest,
footage of Jon Bon Jovi in a London taxi, and pictures he took of
Demi Moore on a beach in Goa for a fashion magazine. There is even
a shot of Stewart in an Andy Warhol-like wig.
</P>
<P>
   ``A bit like Warhol, I've been obsessed with documenting things
and filming stuff,'' said Stewart who edits his films in his London
apartment, the same one featured in all its mod-sensibility on his
CDs virtual tour. He said he plans to produce and post the new
films to his site every couple of weeks or so and play host to a
range of events.
</P>
<P>
   Right now Stewart is holding an online contest. The winner gets
an all- expenses paid trip to London to be his guest presenter on
Sly-Fi TV's Halloween special.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as he is the hub of a wildly spinning world of bits, bytes
and beats, Stewart, says in the end that it is not as complicated
as it might seem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just a traditional singer-song writer,'' he said, ``using
contemporary methods.''

THE TOY PROJECTILE PROVING GROUNDS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By PHIL PATTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The strange red mark that kept showing up on the arms and
bellies of wide receivers was quickly named ``the Elway cross.'' As
soon as the quarterback John Elway came into the National Football
League, he became known for his rifle arm and rope-straight spiral.
Today, with a Super Bowl victory to his credit at last, Elway holds
another record, widely publicized by the Oddzon toy company. He has
thrown the finned Koosh Vortex Mach 110 more than 110 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Oddzon began as the maker of the Koosh ball. Today, as part of
Hasbro, the toy giant, it belongs to the same family as Nerf, its
distant rival. Together, Koosh and Nerf are building better balls _
and the guns to fire them. Both Nerf, the ball of one generation,
and Koosh, that of the next, quickly evolved into other products _
for instance, backboards and hoops for closet doors.
</P>
<P>
   Housed in the same Silicon Valley industrial park as high-tech
neighbors like Zilog, the semiconductor maker, Oddzon is a strange
combination of off-the-wall invention and industrial design.
Experimental balls sail through its parking lot at lunch; a few
months later, they sail across kids' rooms and yards.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Grimm, the vice president of product development, recently
put out a call on the Internet for Stanford design school graduates
for his staff. Hits in the $14 billion toy business _ two-thirds of
whose products are new each year _ are hard to come by. For this
reason, Hasbro, which just announced the closing of its last
factory in Rhode Island, where it has its headquarters, keeps
Oddzon and Larami (the water-gun people), its corporate sibling,
off on their own, uncontaminated by the slow product cycles of the
company's older units. Oddzon will soon be testing balls in a new
headquarters in Napa.
</P>
<P>
   The company began like a small electronics company, from the
simple idea of the Koosh ball _ named for the sound it ostensibly
makes. The prototype was an assemblage of rubber bands designed to
teach children to play catch. Then one day, an aerospace engineer
named John Hunter walked into the Oddzon offices with the idea for
the Vortex.
</P>
<P>
   The Vortex is more complicated than it looks. It took intensive
research to figure out the need for different gripping materials
and the most gentle of ribbings on the not-quite-symmetrical ball.
The Vortex Howler added a sort of whistle to the foam ball; the
smaller Pocket Vortex and the Mega Vortex followed.
</P>
<P>
   Not content with test tosses down the hall and across the lot,
Oddzon developed a catapult to create constant throws, hired
testers and even cemented thin white threads to test balls to study
their aerodynamics. Dr. Ilan Kroo, an aeronautical engineer at
Stanford, looked at ``the issue of boundary layer adhesion'' _
stall factor and drag, in fancy terms. Holding test balls out the
window of a speeding car provided an adequate wind-tunnel
substitute. The Wright Brothers, after all, used a bicycle for the
same purpose.
</P>
<P>
   The latest product in the Oddzon family is the Tornado, a
spring-loaded launcher for rubber rings that simultaneously sail
and hang when Grimm fires them across the office. ``That's what we
call the `wow' factor,'' he said. This contrasts with the
``aspirational factor'' of a product like the Vortex: be like Mike,
throw like John Elway.
</P>
<P>
   With the Vortex, I can throw a spiral every time. I couldn't
replicate Elway's 110 yards, but with the Tornado, I achieved the
promised 70-foot flight almost every time.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for the Tornado, which the company hopes will be a big
Christmas hit, came from 1950s design for ring-shape artillery
shells, which would travel farther and straighter, thanks to their
aerodynamic qualities. It took months, however, to ``prove the
physics,'' as Grimm put it, and determine the ``spring
efficiencies.''
</P>
<P>
   For the final product, the challenge was to find just the right
spring strength and wrap it all in a shape that wasn't too gunlike
to turn off parents _ a style Grimm calls ``swoopy doopy.'' The
resulting shapes are as exaggerated as the language on the box:
``awesome pinpoint accuracy!'' and ``incredible distance!'' The old
hard sell lives on at Toys ``R'' Us.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country in Cleveland, Nerf has also moved beyond its
original ball into a line of guns that fire sponge darts and disks.
They bear such names as Expand-a Blast, Ratchet Blast and Pulsator.
Nerf and Koosh seemed poised to compete on the fun-gun battlefield.
</P>
<P>
   Do balls lead inevitably to guns? I wondered. When I tested the
Vortex 110, I was able to throw it only 60 yards or so. Was there a
lesson there? However much you improve the ball, it's the rifle arm
behind it that makes the difference.

A `WEBLIOGRAPHY' OF HUMOR WITH ACADEMIC CREDENTIALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
(jt) 
 By GEORGE ROBINSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   How many conservative economists does it take to change a light
bulb? Heard any good anecdotes about Canadian actors lately? Know
any good songs about Socrates?
</P>
<P>
   What do these questions have in common? The answer to each may
be found at an unlikely reference source, the Webliography for
Humour. Compiled by librarians at Mount Royal College, Calgary,
Canada, it provides more than 50 links to such strenuously
nonacademic sites as the Dr. Seuss Parody Page, the Dilbert Zone
and the Doonesbury Town Hall. It also lists some Web sites that at
first glance (only) might seem to belong in a college library: the
First International Virtual Conference on Mad Science, the Journal
of Nursing Jocularity and Philosophy Songs.
</P>
<P>
   The Webliography for Humour
(www.mtroyal.ab.ca/programs/academserv/lib/Subguide/sghumour.htm)
isn't the only Web-site compilation that can be found on the
library's Web pages, but it is one of the more popular. It was
compiled by Margy MacMillan, the library's Internet coordinator.
``The subject webliographies were set up as a way of providing
quick access to good information for our students here at the
college,'' she said. ``When I was putting the original
webliographies together in the summer of 1997, I came across so
much good, funny stuff that I had to put a humor webliography
together.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the 1997-98 academic year, it received 226 hits, more than
many of our serious webliographies, including the one for
libraries. The webliography has proved very popular with faculty,
although to my knowledge none of them have yet incorporated it into
curriculum.''
</P>
<P>
   She's happy to say that she hasn't had any complaints. ``There
is after all a serious academic connection to most of the sites
listed,'' she insisted. Like the Jean-Paul Sartre Cookbook?
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, some of them are kind of academic in tone. Well, in a
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Macmillan's favorite link on the list is the Dr. Seuss
Parody Page (klinzhai.iuma.com/drseuss/seuss/seuss.parody.html),
which is also, coincidentally, one of the most popular sites listed
in the webliography. ``Hasta la Vista and the Old English Computer
Glossary are tied for second on my list,'' Ms. MacMillan added,
referring to a pair of clever sendups of computer jargon and search
engines.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, a site called Jokes About Economists and Economics
(netec.wustl.edu/jokec.html) features five different answers to the
question ``How many conservative economists does it take to change
a light bulb?'' The best: ``None. They're all waiting for the
unseen hand of the market to correct the lighting disequilibrium.''

 (Attn: N.C., Ga.)   (af)  
 By DANA CANEDY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For information on everything from black-owned businesses to
hip-hop, Internet users can choose from a growing number of Web
sites aimed at African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Derrick Brown, a graduate student at the Georgia Institute of
Technology in Atlanta, has been visiting these sites for several
years, mainly for news on topics of particular interest to
African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically they present a perspective and news you are not
going to see every week'' at other sites, Brown said. Even so, he
became frustrated four years ago while trying to keep up with the
growing number of such Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the early days of the Web, I spent a lot of aimless time
wandering and really didn't know where the stuff I wanted was,''
recalled Brown, 28, an electrical engineering student.
</P>
<P>
   So he helped create the Universal Black Pages, a directory to
keep abreast of African-American sites (www.ubp.com). ``We did just
what the guys at Yahoo did,'' he said of the directory, which he
and his partners created initially as a project of the association
for black graduate students at Georgia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   The directory has grown larger each year, reflecting a surge in
the number of sites focused on African-American interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take in, on average, about 150 submitted sites a month,''
Brown said. The directory initially listed 800 sites and now
includes thousands, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wendy Coleman, 30, a college administrator at North Carolina
State University in Raleigh, has used black Web sites to find
information on historically black colleges and even to hunt for a
black-owned bridal shop to provide a dress for her forthcoming
wedding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is a need for African-American Web sites,'' said
Ms. Coleman, who is black. ``Many of our issues, concerns and needs
are just not addressed in mainstream America. A lot of times I'm
looking for material and data targeted at education that deals with
African-Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   While she was not able to find the wedding gown she wanted on
the Web, she said she may go on line to find a black-owned bed and
breakfast where she can spend her first day as a married woman.
``I'm an information junkie,'' Ms. Coleman said, ``and that is a
place where so many different avenues of information exist.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Internet has a wide range of black-oriented sites,
like those of the National Association of Black Scuba Divers
(www.nabsdivers.org) and the Young Black Entrepreneurs
(www.ybe-inc.com). There are online editions of Ebony magazine
(www.ebonymag.com), Essence (www.essence.com) and Black Enterprise
(www.blackenterprise.com), and a site for black sports enthusiasts
at &QL; 
urbansportsnetwork.com.
</P>
<P>
   There is even a site for black golfers, sponsored by the
Minority Golf Association of America (www.mgaa.com).
</P>
<P>
   Over all, black-oriented sites have a lot of the same
information, although Net Noir, for one, has worked hard to be more
comprehensive and is designed so well that it stands apart from the
pack.
</P>
<P>
   Net Noir and similar sites seem to have less advertising than
general-interest sites, making them heavy on house ads. The big
businesses that do advertise tend to pop up on most of the sites,
And the advertisements from those companies _ including
Hewlett-Packard and Microsoft _ generally promote their fair-hiring
practices and highlight black employees.
</P>
<P>
   With so many sites out there to explore, Soul Search
(www.soulsearch. net), ``the search engine for the world's people
of color,'' puts you on autopilot as you travel the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Soul Search breaks sites down into useful categories like art,
religion and health, and includes What's New, What's Cool and Top
10 areas. The site's listings aren't extensive but appear to be
growing. Soul Search is an easy way to find out what is available
among black-oriented sites. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WWW.BLACKVOICES.COM &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A site with something for everyone is Black Voices, which
invites visitors to ``make a little noise yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   It is an ideal place to go for news of current events. The
information is timely and interesting, with color photos and
graphics. For instance, the site recently included an article on
the income gains and decline in poverty levels among
African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   And it ran a tribute to Florence Griffith Joyner, the world's
fastest woman, who died last month of what appeared to be a heart
seizure. Visitors could leave messages for her family, view
pictures of her in her Olympic glory and get a list of books about
her.
</P>
<P>
   Black Voices features comprehensive lists for anyone looking for
specific clubs and activities, including sites for black
entrepreneurs, poetry groups, a cooking club and a group for ``big
beautiful women.'' Visitors can join chat rooms and use message
boards.
</P>
<P>
   A page called Sister 2 Sister proclaims, ``There are some things
that brothers will just never get, which is why this one is for
ladies only.'' The cooking club page, called the Stove Top, greets
viewers with a note that says: ``This area is for all you gourmet
cooks, barbecue legends and folks that just plain 'ole know how to
burn. Share and exchange recipes from your favorite African,
Caribbean, American or any other cultural dishes you like.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, there are not many recipes listed. Two that were
available were for banana cake, made with mashed bananas and
buttermilk, and for polenta with artichokes.
</P>
<P>
   For visitors who are more into careers than cooking, a Career
Center lets them post resumes for review by prospective employers.
Another interactive section is an online auction where visitors can
buy or sell a wide range of items from toys to vacations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the place where buyers and sellers have the ability to
wheel and deal from the comfort of their own home,'' the site says.
A recent list of merchandise up for grabs included black dolls,
Civil War memorabilia and even a hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors were also trading Sammy Sosa and Mark McGwire baseball
cards, computers and 20 acres of land. Participants are given
starting prices, the amount bid so far for items on the block and
the length of time the auction will run.
</P>
<P>
   This site is easy to navigate, with simple, colorful icons that
lead the user through the options. So whether you want an update on
your horoscope or on the political climate in Congo, this site
truly represents a range of black voices. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   WWW.BUPPIE.COM &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This site aimed at ``buppies'' _ black urban professionals _ is
not as snooty as it sounds. There is actually a surprising amount
of useful information at Buppies on Line.
</P>
<P>
   But the site's creators, who use the slogan ``Bringing black
America together in cyberspace,'' are mindful of what the first
``p'' in buppies stands for. A banner on the home page advertises
the Buppies Online Resume Databank, a service that allows users to
submit and edit their resumes in an online database that companies
can peruse for potential employees.
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult to gauge the databank as a job-searching tool: a
feature that would show users a list of participating corporations
is not yet running.
</P>
<P>
   The emphasis on professionalism is carried through to other
sections of the site. The education page features articles on
scholastic software for children and on preparing for college
exams.
</P>
<P>
   On the sports page however, the professional tone starts to
wilt: an article on golf, predicated on the success of Tiger Woods,
concludes with an apparently irony-free discussion of how women can
pursue promising mates on the links. Acting helpless, according to
this article, is a sure tactic: ``No self-respecting black man can
resist a damsel in distress.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is plenty of good information on the site, and it
is organized in a way that is easy to navigate. There is some
lighter stuff here, too, like a list of vacation spots _
bed-and-breakfasts, spas, resorts, _ with black owners and
operators, and a calendar of this year's high-profile black college
football games that includes useful tourist information for all the
games' home cities.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, Buppies on Line tackles headier topics like the
question of whether the Social Security reserve should be invested
in stocks and bonds in addition to government securities. Clearly,
such topics affect all Americans, but finding them here may
increase the likelihood that more African-Americans will read about
them.
</P>
<P>
   The flaw here is timeliness. Buppies on Line hasn't been updated
since early August, and many of the articles have been out of date
much longer than that. The Social Security article, for example,
shares the screen with features on subjects that include Jesse
Jackson's Wall Street conference (which was held in January), Roger
Ferguson Jr.'s nomination to the Federal Reserve Board (which
happened last November) and the announcement of an urban renewal
program by Robert Reich (before he resigned as Labor secretary in
November 1996).
</P>
<P>
   Even some of the more current information seemed forced into
categories that don't quite fit. This past summer, for example,
under Issues Affecting Us, there was an article in about President
Clinton's top Secret Service agent being forced to testify before
the grand jury in the Monica S. Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, the account never clearly stated whether the agent
is black, which is relevant only because the article was included
on a black-oriented Web site. More to the point, the site never
addressed the issue of how this article would affect
African-Americans. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WWW.MOSAICBOOKS.COM &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This literary site, could, at first glance, pass for the black
Amazon.com of the Internet, and it is in fact an associate of the
Amazon site. Here you can find books _ albeit a limited number _ by
black and Hispanic authors.
</P>
<P>
   There are descriptions and prices for some of the latest fiction
by black authors, like ``Milk in My Coffee'' by Eric Jerome Dickey,
about an interracial relationship, and the ``The Store of a Million
Items: Stories'' by Michelle Cliff, about the author's
Caribbean-American heritage.
</P>
<P>
   The Book of the Month is a useful feature that suggests to
visitors some of the better books by black authors, though serious
readers will probably have already read many of the selections.
</P>
<P>
   The choice for October is ``Beloved,'' for which the author and
Nobel laureate Toni Morrison won a 1988 Pulitzer Prize. September's
selection was ``Invisible Man,'' the novel that established Ralph
Ellison as a literary talent.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, though, serious bookworms should not hope for too much
from this site. The problem is that the it could be so much more.
Mosaicbooks.com bills itself as a showcase for ``the latest in
black and Hispanic literature,'' so beyond the Book of the Month
picks, you won't find much of the classic work of authors like
James Baldwin and Langston Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the books the site lists cannot be purchased directly
from the site. ``Preview the books of your choice, then go to your
favorite independent bookstore and purchase the book,'' visitors
are told.
</P>
<P>
   Those books that are also carried by Amazon _ look for the ``our
price'' information at the end of the book description _ can be
ordered by clicking on the book's cover, which takes you to its
page at Amazon.
</P>
<P>
   The site also includes a plug for the Mosaic literary magazine,
including a limited-time offer of a free book on tape with your
subscription. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WWW.NETNOIR.COM &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of the coolest African-American-oriented sites is Net Noir,
which calls itself ``the black network.'' According to its mission
statement, the site aims to be ``the No. 1 black interactive online
community in the world.'' A lofty goal, but the creators of this
site come as close as any to pulling it off.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers can get lost in this site and never feel the need for a
road map. It has everything: a gospel-music area, news and chats, a
monthly travel feature on preferred destinations and daily national
and international news. There is an events calendar, celebrity
interviews, book reviews, professional networking opportunities and
online shopping that points visitors toward black-owned businesses.
</P>
<P>
   A daily spotlight on Net Noir club members is basically a dating
service, complete with color photos.page says.
</P>
<P>
   A recently featured bachelor from New York proclaimed in his
profile: ``I am very outspoken and believe in keeping things very
real. I only do to others as I want them to do to me.'' Visitors
who somehow found the declaration appealing could click on his
e-mail address to let fate, as it were, take matters from there.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of links to other black-oriented Web sites
here. Net Noir is user-friendly, with a lively display and catchy
headlines to guide the viewer. The site looks a little busy, but
that can be excused because of the amount of great information that
is packed into it. &QL;

 OH, TO BE ON THE BOULEVARD WITH A CALLING CARD AND YOU  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By HERBERT MUSCHAMP   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Blues in the night. A purple heart for the lovelorn. Peter
Eisenman's new design for a Parisian telephone kiosk is oddly
poignant, coming from an architect noted for such cold-blooded
formal explorations as the Wexner Center for the Arts in Columbus,
Ohio, and that city's convention center, with its metal roof that
undulates like a bed of snakes.
</P>
<P>
   Here, Eisenman seems inspired by the prospect of creating a
pavilion for two in the capital city of romance. (April in Paris.)
But the two callers that the kiosk can accommodate could be
strangers. They could be getting busy signals. (April, the cruelest
month.) Or a bad connection. (Allo? Allo?) Here's an alfresco
setting for the Poulenc-Cocteau opera ``La Voix Humaine.''
</P>
<P>
   Commissioned by J.C. Decaux, the French firm best known for
deluxe sidewalk pay toilets, the kiosk is a prototype being
considered for placement throughout the city. Designs are also
being submitted by Norman Foster, Jean Nouvel, Charles Gwathmey,
Robert Stern, James Stewart Polshek, and Tod Williams and Billie
Tsien. A decision is expected in about six weeks, and eventually
Decaux plans to distribute 5,000 kiosks, perhaps in a mix of
designs.
</P>
<P>
   Eisenman proposes to use a carbon-reinforced plastic fabric,
similar to that used for bulletproof vests. Designed on a computer,
the enclosure _ made from a single swirling, folded plane _ would
be anchored to a metal column that supports two phones and a panel
for illuminated advertising. Seating would be provided for one
caller, or two close pals. The kiosk's skin would vary in opacity
from open mesh to solid canopy, the latter acting as a rain shield.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time that Eisenman has toyed with the
conventions of coupledom. In 1972, his experimental House VI, in
Cornwall, Conn., had a slot in the floor of the master bedroom that
divided the bed in two. Philosophically, Eisenman is often drawn to
the idea of collapsing dualisms (inside and outside; site and
surroundings) into a fuzzy state of in-between. That bent is
translated here into a form in which seating blossoms into roof,
and enclosure dissolves into the perfume of the blue hour.
</P>
<P>
   What a sensual beauty-freak Eisenman is turning out to be. In
his most recent work, he has given up his reliance on the Cartesian
grid in favor of softer contours that billow, swell and undulate.
With the kiosk, this new approach has produced an object almost
floral in effect, perhaps a newly bred lavender rose that tapers on
one side to a sharp, thorny point _ a reminder that pain is one of
love's glories.
</P>
<P>
   Like many theoretically inclined architects, Eisenman has been
reluctant to acknowledge the link between formalism and beauty, but
his work is starting to do it for him. He calls himself a critical
architect, an antagonist to convention. But beauty has always
offered the most powerful critique of the difference between life
as it is and as it should be. &QL;

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Metaphorically speaking, siding is the skin of a house. It
serves two functions: it protects the house from the elements,
insects and rodents and adds style and beauty to the exterior of
the house.
</P>
<P>
   Siding can be made of wood, vinyl or metal. Many manufacturers
claim that modern siding materials, vinyl and metal, are
maintenance-free. Indeed they do require less care than wood siding
but still these materials are vulnerable to the the environment. No
matter what the material, it's important to inspect the siding
yearly because, sooner or later, it will need some maintenance and
repair. Obviously, it is best to find minor problems before they
mushroom into major headaches.
</P>
<P>
   As you walk around your house, look at all surfaces but
especially at those areas most likely to develop problems. These
include the corners near the roof, areas butting the door or window
trim and those sections that mate with the foundation.
</P>
<P>
   At one time, wood was the most common material used for
clapboard siding. It was plentiful, easy to work and provided good
insulation, but wood siding requires more maintenance than other
materials. It must be painted or stained to withstand the
onslaughts of weather and insects and it is more likely to split
than other materials.
</P>
<P>
   The durability of wooden clapboard siding depends largely on the
type of wood used. Most siding is made of softwood, like pine or
fir. Older houses have boards cut from massive first-growth trees.
This wood has a dense cellular structure that makes it remarkably
rot-resistant. Newer wood, cut from second- and third-growth trees,
is less durable.
</P>
<P>
   When inspecting wooden siding, first look for structural defects
like warps, cracks or splits in the boards. These should be
repaired before repainting. Boards that are warped away from the
house should be straightened because they offer a gap that insects
find desirable as nesting sites. Flatten these boards by driving
long, galvanized deck screws through them into the sheathing or
studs behind.
</P>
<P>
   Cracks or splits in the boards are not difficult to repair. Pry
open the crack with a screwdriver _ be careful not to overdo this
or you will split the entire board apart _ then coat both sides
with epoxy wood glue and squeeze the board back together.
</P>
<P>
   It may be necessary to wedge a piece of scrap lumber against the
bottom edge of the board to keep the crack from opening up before
the glue sets. Setting up a wedge is easy enough if the cracked
board is close to the ground. For a crack that is higher up, you
will have to hold the parts together by driving galvanized deck
screws into the board on either side of the crack.
</P>
<P>
   A board that is badly split or has a piece missing should be
replaced. It is not necessary, however, to pull out the entire
length of siding. Instead the damaged section can be cut loose and
replaced with a new piece. Drive wedges under the board to raise it
away from the wall, then use a backsaw to make cuts on either side
of the damage.
</P>
<P>
   Before sawing, set a block of scrap wood on the siding below to
protect it from the blade. The backsaw cannot cut completely
through the damaged siding because the top will be covered by an
overlapping board. Switch to a keyhole saw and push the narrow
blade under the overlap to finish the cut.
</P>
<P>
   After making the cuts, you should be able to pull the section
out. If it proves stubborn, there may be a few hidden nails
anchoring it to the wall. Pry the board up with a wrecking bar to
expose these nails, then cut them with a mini-hacksaw. If you
cannot find the nails, use a wood chisel to break up the section
and remove it in pieces. Be careful with the chisel so you don't
damage the adjacent boards or the building felt.
</P>
<P>
   Cut a new piece of clapboard to length and coat the ends with
primer. Before pushing this new board into place, examine the
building felt on the wall for rips or tears. Patch any defects with
new pieces of felt.
</P>
<P>
   Tap the new board in place and secure it with finishing nails.
If you have to nail close to the ends of the board, drill pilot
holes first to keep the board from splitting. Countersink the nail
heads and fill the holes with wood filler. Caulk the seams on
either side of the new board and paint it to match the surrounding
boards.

   HISPANIC-HISTORY (Washington) _ For Hispanics, the long march to
political power began shortly after World War II. We trace the
effort, looking at such leaders as Cesar Chavez, who won national

The development comes at a time when more Hispanics are running for
national and statewide posts generally. By MARK HELM and STEWART M.
POWELL.
</P>
<P>
   With HISP-LOGO graphic.

IMPEACHMENT MOTIVATIONS: TELL THE TRUTH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives want to
impeach the president of the United States, they certainly have the
authority to do it. Constituents command no veto power over the
actions of their elected representatives in Congress _ except at
the ballot box, of course, where voters exercise the ultimate veto.
</P>
<P>
   Public-opinion polls indicate that somewhere between 60 and 70
percent of Americans are happy with the job that President Clinton
is doing. Significant majorities in most polls oppose the idea of
removing Clinton from office through the process of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   As the House forges ahead with impeachment proceedings, it will
be interesting to see how the voters use their veto when the
opportunity presents itself Nov. 3.
</P>
<P>
   The pro-impeachment crowd has been saying that congressional
decisions on impeachment should not be dictated, or even
influenced, by public opinion. When it comes to the serious
business of impeaching a president, they say, Congress must
exercise its constitutional responsibilities without regard for
polls or elections.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds good. Sounds like the very definition of political
integrity.
</P>
<P>
   But that is not what's happening here _ not by a long shot.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, the pro-impeachment forces in Congress are doing
exactly the opposite of what they'd like us to think they are
doing. They are pandering to public opinion, but they are pandering
to a small percentage of the public rather than the majority.
</P>
<P>
   There are people in this country who just plain hate Bill
Clinton. They were outraged when he was elected president, more
outraged when he was re-elected, and more outraged yet when they
learned of his White House philandering with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The 21 Republican members of the House Judiciary Committee who
voted Monday to initiate an impeachment inquiry _ and members of
both parties who will endorse the committee's decision in a full
House vote _ are representing the nation's Clinton-haters.
</P>
<P>
   Those representatives have the authority to do so, unless the
voters remove them from office in next month's elections. But if
they really care about integrity in government, why don't they tell
the truth about what they're doing?
</P>
<P>
   They all sat in front of the TV cameras Monday, gushing
sanctimonious platitudes about protecting the American judicial
system from the felonious prevarications of William Jefferson
Clinton. They embraced much of Ken Starr's laundry list of
allegedly impeachable offenses and added several of their own _
alleged violations that had eluded even the fertile imaginations of
Starr and his minions at the independent counsel's office.
</P>
<P>
   Starr was grasping at straws when he accused Clinton of
obstructing justice in the Paula Jones civil suit. The committee
majority's counsel, David Schippers, now has conjured up a
widespread conspiracy of obstruction involving Clinton, Lewinsky,
presidential pal Vernon Jordan and Clinton's secretary, Betty
Currie.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have set out to impeach Clinton because they are
offended by his sexual proclivities _ and because he is despised by
a small percentage of Americans whose influence over the
congressional majority far exceeds their actual numbers.
</P>
<P>
   These Republicans have the authority to do what they are doing,
even at the risk of angering the anti-impeachment majority of
Americans. But they really ought to tell the truth about it instead
of hiding behind high-sounding but dishonest rhetoric about their
reverence for the rule of law.

`VENGEANCE' WON'T BE THINE FOR LONG ON THURSDAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Juicy premise, shaky execution. ``Vengeance Unlimited'' wants to
be a ``Stingray,'' the drama series that aired in the 1980s and
chronicled the adventures of a mysterious do-gooder who helped
people turn the tables on their tormentors.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Vengeance Unlimited,'' which premiered last Tuesday but
slides into its regular slot at 7 p.m. Thursday on ABC, Michael
Madsen is Mr. Chapel, who devotes himself to meting out punishment
to those who dance around the legal system. He figures the usually
white-collar sleazebags use high-priced lawyers to work the system
to their advantage; Mr. Chapel merely bends it on behalf of the
victims.
</P>
<P>
   Pay? ``One million,'' he tells would-be clients, who often look
at him as though he's insane. But he doesn't actually want money,
only the right to request a favor in return, at a later time,
depending on what you do and what service you can provide him. He
then applies that service to aid someone else. The cycle continues;
Mr. Chapel's Rolodex grows.
</P>
<P>
   Madsen, who has done more than 35 films, is well-cast here as a
somewhat brooding character with the kind of sinister nature that
makes you feel good only if he's on your side. He refers to himself
only as ``Mr. Chapel'' and gets away with it because people are
deathly afraid to ask whether a first name goes with that.
</P>
<P>
   Why is he doing this? ``We live in a world where people can kill
someone and get a book deal out of it because they have the right
lawyer,'' he says at one point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vengeance Unlimited'' is up against the NBC Thursday-night
machine, which cranked up its debut last week, simply hammering the
competition. ABC insists that this will be an alternative.
</P>
<P>
   With the low-brow drama presented in the pilot, I don't think
so. Plus, ``Nothing Sacred'' and ``Cracker,'' last season's
sacrificial lambs, were infinitely superior shows. Is a network
president in Mr. Chapel's Rolodex?

have apparently sailed 200 miles from Guadaloupe to Anguilla,
scientists reported today. Their report has wowed a community of
scientists that has been arguing since early in this century about
whether such journeys were even remotely possible, let alone
observable. By documenting the voyage of fifteen large, land-loving
creatures _ enough to form a new population _ the study provides
the first clear-cut evidence in support of those biologists who
argue that seemingly impossible journeys like this could be
important avenue for the disperal of species around the words. By

Koosh and Nerf are building better balls - and the guns to fire
them. Both Nerf, the ball of one generation, and Koosh, that of the

the Arts in Columbus, Ohio, and that city's convention center, with
its metal roof that undulates like a bed of snakes. Commissioned by
J.C. Decaux, the French firm best known for deluxe sidewalk pay
toilets, the kiosk is one of several prototypes being considered
for placement throughout the city. Designs are also being submitted
by Norman Foster, Jean Nouvel, Charles Gwathmey, Robert A.M. Stern,
James Stewart Polshek, and Tod Williams and Billie Tsien. Decaux
plans to eventually distribute 5,000 of the kiosks, perhaps in a

studio, I had the requisite bed, desk and couch from Ikea, but I
needed everything else. Determined to fill the apartment with
Parisian treasures, I ruled out the notoriously overpriced Left
Bank antique stores and Parisian flea markets like the Marche aux
Puces at Porte de Clignancourt. Instead, I began at the flea
market's poorer cousins, the brocantes, which are less publicized
roving antiques fairs. Like Parisians, most brocantes head south

 DeBARTOLO'S FUTURE WITH NINERS REMAINS UNCERTAIN  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC BRAZIL and CHUCK FINNIE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BATON ROUGE, La. _ Edward J. DeBartolo Jr.'s guilty plea in a
Louisiana extortion case will keep him out of prison, but may not
put him back in control of his prized 49ers football franchise.
</P>
<P>
   DeBartolo pleaded guilty Tuesday to a felony and won leniency
from prosecutors in exchange for becoming the federal government's
star witness in its case targeting Edwin Edwards, the former
Louisiana governor.
</P>
<P>
   While prosecutors and DeBartolo's lawyer portrayed him as a
victim of an extortion plot by Edwards, documents filed in court
also show the 49ers co-owner used the former governor to get
Louisiana's 15th and last riverboat casino license.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, DeBartolo asked Edwards to obtain, and received, a
confidential report detailing the background of his competitors for
the casino license; he later paid Edwards $400,000 to make sure
there were no problems.
</P>
<P>
   Outside U.S. District Court in Baton Rouge Tuesday, a somber
DeBartolo acknowledged that standing before the judge, listening to
the facts of his crime and pleading guilty ``was like visiting a
little piece of hell.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a very, very long ordeal for me and my family,''
DeBartolo said.
</P>
<P>
   Though he is now a felon, DeBartolo said, ``I am going to seek
to retain the (49ers) franchise.''
</P>
<P>
   DeBartolo and his sister, Denise DeBartolo York, co-own the
49ers through their joint ownership of the Edward J. DeBartolo
Corp., the Youngstown, Ohio-based shopping center development
company established by their late father.
</P>
<P>
   DeBartolo stepped down last December as director and an officer
of the corporation and relinquished management control of the
football franchise after he was told he investigated in the Edwards
case.
</P>
<P>
   NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue, who plans a review of the case
and DeBartolo's other business dealings, issued a written statement
that could scarcely give DeBartolo much hope of a quick return to
heading the football team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. DeBartolo's decision to enter a plea in Louisiana is not
based on any understandings with or commitments from this office
regarding his future status with the 49ers or the NFL,'' Tagliabue
said.
</P>
<P>
   He said York and the team's new interim president, Larry
Thrailkill, would run the franchise through the end of the season _
including the decision about whether to proceed with a new stadium
to replace Candlestick Park.
</P>
<P>
   DeBartolo, 51, who has co-owned the 49ers since 1977, pleaded
guilty to a single count of the rare federal crime of misprision of
felony _ a failure to report what authorities called an extortion
scheme perpetuated against him by Edwards. He was sentenced to two
years on probation and fined $1 million by U.S. District Judge John
V. Parker.
</P>
<P>
   DeBartolo's attorney, Aubrey Harwell, said his client has
suffered anguish because of his failure to report the extortion
attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Harwell said the charge DeBartolo pleaded to is ``so minor and
insignificant we hope that Mr. Tagliabue will not take a harsh
position'' on his return to the 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This man deserves no more punishment,'' Harwell said.
``(DeBartolo) is more of a victim than culpable.''
</P>

</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But a seven-page outline of the evidence supporting DeBartolo's
guilty plea shows he engaged in a perilous scheme to snare insider
information on the award of valuable Louisiana riverboat casino
license.
</P>
<P>
   DeBartolo Entertainment had joined with Hollywood Casino Corp.
to win a casino license for a riverboat in Bossier City, La.
</P>
<P>
   DeBartolo talked with Edwards as early as October 1996 about
whether Edwards had the votes on the Louisiana gambling commission
to swing the license in favor or DeBartolo.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 24, 1997, with the commission's decision less than a
month away, DeBartolo asked Edwards to get a copy of a confidential
state police report on the backgrounds of all those vying for the
casino license.
</P>
<P>
   On the same day, Edwards talked to a state senator about
obtaining the document. ``If ... I were able to get a copy of that,
it would certainly solidify my position with some people,'' Edwards
said, according to the court documents.
</P>
<P>
   A day later, Edwards told DeBartolo, ``Hey, I'll have that
summary in my hands about 5 this evening, you want me to Fed Ex it
to you?'' Edwards added, ``I still have ... assurances from the
right people that if and when they ever have the vote, we're, we've
got it.''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks later, before the vote, Edwards is depicted as
pressing DeBartolo in a Baton Rouge hotel for a $400,000 payoff to
secure the casino license. DeBartolo, who wondered how he would get
the cash to Louisiana, then met with the former governor on March
12, 1997, and paid the money.
</P>
<P>
   On March 13, 1997, DeBartolo's group was awarded the casino
license.
</P>
<P>
   York, DeBartolo's sister who is chairwoman of the DeBartolo
Corp., issued a statement Tuesday making sure everyone understood
her brother's legal troubles were his own and unrelated to the
49ers.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a personal level, I know that this has been, and continues
to be, a very difficult time for my brother. My thoughts and
prayers are with him, his wife and children,'' York said. ``On a
business level, I have never been involved in the California-based
DeBartolo Entertainment Corporation and I cannot comment on issues
relating to that organization.''
</P>
<P>
   At team headquarters in Santa Clara, General Manager Dwight
Clark said, ``We're all hoping the best for Mr. D. We're hoping
this is one more step to getting this behind him.''

USING HUMANS TO SEARCH THE WEB 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MICHEL MARRIOTT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Retrieving information from an increasingly tangled World Wide
Web is one of the most common online activities. Retrieving
information that's actually useful is far more rare.
</P>
<P>
   While search engines mostly use roving software robots to scour
the Web, the Mining Co. (www.miningco.com), a relatively new
vehicle on the information superhighway, is trying to prove that it
has found a higher technology: the human brain.
</P>
<P>
   Since February 1997, the Mining Co. has built its Internet
information gathering power on the shoulders of scores of people,
called guides, scattered over the planet.
</P>
<P>
   Each guide, a specialist in a topic of Web interest, like
politics, humor or jazz, is responsible for searching the Internet
and listing and building the best Web sites in their subjects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our guides use search engines that pull up all that stuff and
then they pick the gems out, polish them and present them,'' said
Scott Kurnit, the president, chief executive and founder of The
Mining Co.
</P>
<P>
   The guides, which must complete an intensive 15-week training
course, are also expected to regularly moderate online chats,
maintain bulletin boards, write original material and promptly
answer e-mail from users.
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring The Mining Co.'s uniquely human quality, head shots
with accompanying names (and biographies on demand) of the guides
are a common part of the sites.
</P>
<P>
   They tend to keep search results from overwhelming users by
eliminating irrelevant and repetitious Web sites, as well as dead
links. For instance, a broad search done this week on the single
word ``Clinton'' using Alta Vista found 1.8 million Web pages, the
first one being ``Presbyterian College, Clinton, S.C;'' the same
search on The Mining Co. found 1,568 documents, the first one being
``Starr's End Game - U.S. Politics'' a grouping of information and
resources complied by a guide, Rowena Wall, who has worked on
various political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until software becomes much more intelligent and can filter
out the garbage, humans can do this better,'' said Michael Griffis,
a stocks guide (http://stocks.miningco.com) for The Mining Co. in
Aurora, Ohio. His wife, Susan Griffis, is also a guide for
cookbooks (http://cookbooks.miningco.com).
</P>
<P>
   The dependence on guides differs, said officials for The Mining
Co., from the Internet search giant Yahoo that uses some people to
build and maintain its directory of sites, but still heavily
depends on machines to do much of the work. This is esepcially
evident, some critics of Yahoo say, when a search can't be
satisfied by Yahoo's directory the search is then automatically
routed to a traditional search engine.
</P>
<P>
   But a spokeswoman for Yahoo suggested that the company's use of
people, while not disclosing how many, to assemble and manage its
directory of sites makes The Mining Co. less distinctive than
purports to be.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, an open search of the word ``Clinton'' on Yahoo found
541 sites organzied into 50 categories, the first one being
``government: U.S. government: Politics: Political Issues: Clinton
administration.''
</P>
<P>
   But The Mining Co. maintains that its especially personal touch
and depth of guide expertise and passion in their areas makes it
unique on the Internet. ``Where we are similar to Yahoo we think we
do a better job,'' said Jake Levich, The Mining Co. senior editor.
</P>
<P>
   Today the service has 639 guides in more than 20 countries all
wired together by the same Internet technology that they serve. The
Mining Co., says Kurnit, covers 12,000 topics for three million
regular users. The guides have 350,000 links to Web sites, 75,000
pages of its own content and 360 electronic newsletters.
</P>
<P>
   And while the privately held company is not yet turning a
profit, people are discovering the service. Media Metrix, which
measures the traffic of the Internet, listed The Mining Co. as 85
in November 1997 among sites accessed from home and work.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the most recent information available, the service
was placed at 43 in that category. The company gets revenue through
advertising. Guides are paid a percentage of those revenues based
largely on the popularity of their sites, Kurnit said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the service's most visited site, one about video
game strategies, earned its guide $5,000 last month. Other guides
could make as little as $100 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Kurnit said an added benefit of having people so involved in
creating and maintaining the service, which he describes as a
hybrid of an online community and navigation tool, is that it
brings together people as well as information.
</P>
<P>
   ``First and foremost people are looking for directory assistance
on the Internet,'' said Kurnit. ``They are generally not happy with
what they've found.''

   Q. My cherry tomatoes are threatening to take over the garden. I
set six-foot stakes beside them when I planted. When that proved
inadequate I set three more stakes around each vine as a sort of
cage. It didn't work. They're all over the place. I love the
tomatoes, but I don't want the vines to smother my late crops that
are just coming on. Is there a way to prune them?
</P>
<P>
   A. The original wild tomatoes were small fruits growing on
rampant vines, and most of their cherry-size descendants are
similarly exuberant. Many of them are also, like their wild
relatives, comparatively blight resistant. While full-size tomatoes
are usually slowed down by disease well before they die from frost,
cherries keep on going well into fall.
</P>
<P>
   Some varieties are bred to stay dwarf, but yours are clearly the
indeterminate, endlessly growing kind. Their numerous secondary
stems, which could have been restricted to two or three in early
summer, are probably so hunky by now that they're almost the size
of main stems themselves, and the even more numerous tertiary stems
are no doubt quite substantial as well.
</P>
<P>
   At this late date, pruning would be more work that it is worth,
but you could build a makeshift arbor and get them going sideways
so they stop crowding the neighbors. If there's a tree handy, you
can run twine from the lower branches and tie the vines onto it.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, consider growing your cherry tomatoes on a fence or
other support system that permits early horizontal training. Remove
most of the suckers (extra stems that grow out of the leaf nodes).
And don't be surprised when hugeness threatens at the end of the
season anyway. Since none of the dwarf sorts are anywhere near as
tasty as the best long ones, you can think of it as the price you
have to pay for flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How can I dissuade roaming cats from using my flower garden
as their personal litter box and sunning area?
</P>
<P>
   A. Keeping cats from sunning themselves is about as likely as
keeping the sun itself from rising. All you can do is concentrate
on how lovely they are.
</P>
<P>
   To solve the litter box problem, start by removing all the
droppings _ cats go where their noses tell them cats have gone
before. Follow up with a commercial cat repellent, to cover any
smells left behind. (Don't expect the repellent to perform like
Hercules; you really do have to start by cleaning up).
</P>
<P>
   Once the odor problem is solved, make it hard for cats to dig in
the garden by covering any open soil with landscape cloth or
plastic mulch. This leaves newly planted soil as the only
vulnerable area. Cover it with chicken wire until the new plants
have achieved fair size and can be protected with mulch, and you
should have the little dears thoroughly thwarted.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have been reading a book on pruning. Several times the
author mentions removing dead, diseased or damaged branches and
burning them. He gives no explanation why burning is necessary. In
these days of recycling and compost making, is there a particular
reason he says this?
</P>
<P>
   A. Even a well-made compost pile may not heat up enough to kill
the disease spores on sick plants, so anything of this sort you
remove should leave the garden permanently. And wood takes much
longer than other compost ingredients to decompose, even when
shredded.
</P>
<P>
   Where the law still permits, the easiest way to get rid of this
stuff is to burn it. Fire is a great purifier _ no disease can
survive the heat _ and it quickly reduces huge piles of prunings to
small piles of ash.
</P>
<P>
   If open burning is out of the question, bury any sick material
at least a foot deep, burn it in the fireplace or send it to the
landfill. Anything that isn't sick can go through a chipper
(rentable if you don't have one) and then be used as mulch. Or your
town may have a ``wood dump'' where it can be taken.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Please tell me how to save the tubers of Blackie sweet
potato. I don't want to lose this gorgeous plant to frost.
</P>
<P>
   A. The tubers are difficult to save. They must be cured for two
or three weeks at 75 to 80 degrees in high humidity before they can
be stored. Storage temperatures should stay between 55 and 60
degrees. But they are so short-lived that they are likely to rot
before spring, no matter what you do.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, sweet potatoes are easy to grow from rooted
cuttings. Just clip a few healthy stems and remove the lower
leaves. Put the stems in water or in a small pot of planting mix
(not potting soil), being sure that at least one leaf node is
covered.
</P>
<P>
   The stems will root in a week or so. Pot each in a three-inch
pot, and keep in a sunny window where temperatures do not fall
below 60 degrees. Fertilize very sparingly, and be sure the soil
stays moist but not wet. The plants won't look great _ sweet
potatoes need lots of light, more than they ever get indoors _ but
they will grow, though slowly.
</P>
<P>
   By March or April, the new plants should be well branched. If
you have as many as you want, just transfer them to larger pots and
wait until all danger of frost is past to plant them out. If you
want more, take cuttings, as you did in the fall. By May you will
have plenty of healthy young plants to set out in the garden.

LINUS PIONEERS FIND THE DIFFERENCES ARE SUBTLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By PETER WAYNER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The laptop in front of me looked as if it was running
Wordperfect, the mouse felt as if it was interacting with a copy of
Wordperfect, and for all intents and purposes, it (italics)was(end
italics) Wordperfect.
</P>
<P>
   The difference was hidden: there was no Microsoft foundation
supporting the product. This laptop _ an IBM 486 Thinkpad provided
by the Corel Corp., the makers of Wordperfect _ ran the Linux
operating system. And Wordperfect worked fine.
</P>
<P>
   Wordperfect, one of the popular word-processing programs
developed at the beginning of the desktop PC explosion, is one of
the last rivals left to challenge Microsoft in the world of office
automation.
</P>
<P>
   So no one is surprised that Corel is looking for ways to thwart
Microsoft's domination. One strategy is to make sure that people
can use Wordperfect with any one of the non-Microsoft options left.
</P>
<P>
   A writer tapping away won't notice the difference between using
the word processor on a Linux machine or using it on one with a
Microsoft operating system. The letters keep popping up after the
keys are hit. The paragraphs are still aligned, formatted,
tabulated and indexed in the same way. The process of producing the
document is remarkably similar.
</P>
<P>
   Still, differences emerge from time to time. Using a Linux-run
machine with Wordperfect is much like spending time in Europe,
where the plugs, switches and everything else is slightly
different.
</P>
<P>
   Linux, for instance, stores paths to files with forward slashes,
not the back slashes used in Microsoft products. Most of these
minor details shouldn't be too hard for experienced users to
relearn. Novices and people who live in mortal fear of pushing the
wrong button, however, could be driven nuts by such things.
</P>
<P>
   There are more substantial differences as well. Macintosh and
Windows machines, for example, keep fonts in a central repository
where all programs can use them. But Linux lacks a central bank for
fonts, and they may not be available for all software on the
system.
</P>
<P>
   (Wordperfect comes with its own batch of fonts that aren't
installed for other programs, in part because of licensing
restrictions.) Differences like these require a bit more learning
to work around, but none are crippling.
</P>
<P>
   There are also surprising similarities. Wordperfect runs under a
version of X Windows, a non-Microsoft program, known as Kde that
handles much of the same thing as Microsoft Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Some features are strikingly similar to those of Windows, which
makes life easier for novices moving to the platform. There is a
task bar and a button that works much like the Windows Start
button. They're close enough that Microsoft might wonder why it
worked so hard to defeat Apple's claim that the look and feel of a
product could be copyrighted.
</P>
<P>
   One hidden benefit of Linux may be in the lower demands it makes
on computers. Many users run Linux and Wordperfect on older
486-based computers.
</P>
<P>
   Still, people who choose to use Linux and Wordperfect need to
adopt a bit of a frontier settler's mentality. The products are not
dressed up with the musical notes or splashy graphics that
accompany Microsoft and Apple products.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the machines start up with thousands of tiny messages
filled with words like ``SNMP'' and ``daemon'' _ which can be
safely ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Michael C.J. Cowpland, chief executive of Corel, said the
company was working to make it as easy as possible to switch to
Linux. It is developing a product line known as Netwinder that will
bundle Wordperfect and other products, like spreadsheets and
browsers, into one computer running Linux. That will be available
in late fall or early winter. Wordperfect 8 will be released this
fall.

   &QL;  MAINE GROUP OFFERS SOLUTION TO YEAR 2000 COMPUTER CRISIS
</P>
<P>
   By Mary Ellen Butler
</P>
<P>
   States News Service
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Oct. 7 -- A representative from a small Maine
manufacturers' group told Congress Wednesday he had proof that the
year 2000 computer problem could be solved, but not on his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't be making a dent unless it's a national cure. Many
Maine manufacturers have to rely on other states,'' said Rod
Rodrigue, director of Maine's Manufacturers Extension Program.
</P>
<P>
   Without a cure, Maine's businesses could be facing $250 million
in additional computer and electronics repair costs, which Rodrigue
estimated would force employers to cut costs by laying off more
than 9,000 workers early next century.
</P>
<P>
   Rodrigue told a special Senate committee about a computer-based
assessment tool that identifies the areas of a computer system that
are vulnerable to year 2000 glitches.
</P>
<P>
   The tool, called Conversion 2000, takes an inventory of a
computer system, assesses potential threats, develops a contingency
plan, and attempts to fix the problems. It also provides links to
information about small business loans to assist with year 2000
costs.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, the year 2000 problem could cost as much as $200
billion, Rodrigue said.
</P>
<P>
   Many computers, both for government and in the private sector,
will not be able to recognize ``00'' as the year 2000 -- or the
computer will read it as 1900. That problem could wreak havoc on
small businesses across the globe, and the glitch might not be
corrected until 2003.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our nation's 23 million small businesses create two out of
three new jobs, represent over 99 percent of all employers, and are
responsible for more than half of the nation's technological
innovation. In my home state of Maine they are truly the backbone
of our economy,'' said Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, a member of the
Senate special committee.
</P>
<P>
   Conversion 2000 was developed several months ago by the
Department of Commerce's National Institute of Standards and
Technology and 2,500 of the programs were distributed to
Manufacturers Extension Programs, a network that represents small
companies in each state.
</P>
<P>
   However, only the Maine MEP is making use of the tool, Rodrigue
said.
</P>
<P>
   In the past months, Rodrigue and his group have gone around to
all the manufacturers in Maine offering and explaining the program.
So far, more than 100 businesses have used the diagnostic tool.
</P>
<P>
   Rodrigue urged the Senators to get the rest of the nation
involved and to help the groups find additional funding. To bring
the program to the more than 600 manufacturers in Maine, the cost
would be $800,000 to $1 million, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Education, healthcare, government agencies, agriculture and food
processing were the U.S. industries least prepared to deal with
year 2000 computer malfunctions, said Lou Marcoccio of the Gartner
Group, a research consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   About 66 percent of companies in those industries will
experience major system failures in the year 2000 or in the three
to four years following.
</P>
<P>
   About 15 percent of companies in the most prepared industries,
such as insurance, banking and investment services, will experience
major system failures, he said.
</P>
<P>
   There will also be severe implications around the world. Less
developed countries could have significant periods of power
outages, loss of telephone service, interruptions to government
services and unrest.
</P>
<P>
   And businesses need to act sooner, rather than later. It will
take an average of 30 months for a mid-size company to secure all
of their critical operating equipment for the year 2000 bug,
Marcoccio said.
</P>
<P>
   Rodrigue stressed the need for his program to reach companies by
June of 1999 so they have a chance to implement it in time for the
new year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come here on bended knee asking (Congress) not only to help
the 80,000 to 90,000 men and women who work in manufacturing in
Maine, but the 12 million across the nation,'' Rodrigue said.

IN PARIS, EVEN JUNK HAS A CLASS SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By KRISTIN HOHENADEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   I arrived in Paris with two suitcases and soon learned how to
live among other people's things, in a rented room decorated with
Japanese white paper lanterns and nondescript plasterboard shelves.
By the time I graduated to my own studio, I had the requisite bed,
desk and couch from Ikea, but I needed everything else.
</P>
<P>
   Determined to fill the apartment with Parisian treasures, I
ruled out the notoriously overpriced Left Bank antique stores and
Parisian flea markets like the Marche aux Puces at Porte de
Clignancourt _ where it's possible to pick up an armchair for
$200,000.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, I began at the flea market's poorer cousins, the
brocantes, which are less publicized roving antiques fairs. Like
Parisians, most brocantes head south for the summer, but they are
back in full flower for the rentree in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   From vintage leather club chairs to champagne coolers, the
brocantes offer regional antiques at prices below those of Paris.
Admission to most brocantes is free; the few exceptions include the
twice-a-year Grande Brocante at the Place de la Bastille, in early
spring and just before Christmas. It costs 35 francs (about $6.40),
which is reflected in the higher cost of items.
</P>
<P>
   I am fond of the neighborhood brocantes, where decorative
objects are more plentiful than serious antiques. At Place
St.-Sulpice I came upon the gilded mirror ($200) that now hangs on
my wall. On the Pont Louis Philippe at the edge of the Marais I
found the old French flag ($18) that fills the blank space above my
dining room table. On a rainy late fall day on the Place Daumesnil,
I coaxed my entryway rug ($38) from beneath a giant table. On the
Rue St. Charles I got a former milk-bottle carrier ($20) that
serves as a wine rack.
</P>
<P>
   Shopping the brocantes can be intimidating for the uninitiated.
Brocante literally means ``second-hand goods,'' so customers will
have to wade through a lot of junk to find the prizes. Brocanteurs
often display their wares on the ground, leaving them to rain and
dust, not to mention the unsteady feet of those who have had too
much wine at lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Here are the decidedly French items that Pottery Barn isn't
likely to mass produce: ceramic cheese trays in the shape of
France; Napoleon and Josephine cups and saucers; statuettes of
Jeanne d'Arc and Voltaire, and kitchen items for just about every
purpose, from chocolate molds to asparagus servers. And there are
the carafes, ashtrays, sugar tins, coffee mills and garden tools
that are resold at a premium in New York boutiques.
</P>
<P>
   The brocante is an all-day affair, which means that it
inconveniently falls across the sacred lunch hour. Brocanteurs cope
with this schedule either by abandoning their stalls _ for as long
as an hour and a half, the time deemed reasonable for lunch _ or by
feasting at their antique dining tables, with silverware and with
wine. Often, to help pass the afternoon, they drink Champagne.
</P>
<P>
   Browsing the brocante under the chestnut trees one spring
afternoon on the Square des Batignolles with my cousin, I spotted a
green painted tin cafetiere, once used for making coffee, now
merely a decorative item. I picked it up, discussed its merits and
then looked around for the brocanteur. At a nearby table, rowdy
diners clinked glasses and smoked cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   ``S'il vous plait?'' I asked in their general direction. (In
French, ``excusez-moi'' is not a question, but an apology. To be
avoided.)
</P>
<P>
   One man ambled over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oui?'' he asked bemusedly. It was, after all, a Sunday, in the
middle of his lunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bonjour, monsieur,'' I said, holding up the cafetiere, which
in characteristic brocante fashion was missing a price tag. ``Quel
est le prix?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Le prix?'' he said, as if asking himself that question for the
first time. I knew from experience that the price should be around
$20, but in the capricious world of brocante pricing, I also knew
that it could go for as much as $100. He sighed and began a
complicated examination of the cafetiere.
</P>
<P>
   By then it was clear that I was a foreigner. By deploying a few
key phrases, however, it is possible to convey that, stranger or
not, you ``know the brocante,'' and will aid in the war against
paying too much. I knew there was no such thing as a bargain in
France. He told me the cafetiere would be $40, in cash, the
required method of payment at brocantes.
</P>
<P>
   It was best to frown slightly at this point, a gesture
ubiquitous to the French, and to hope he would offer a small
reduction. Some brocanteurs might try convincing you that something
is ``ancien'' or ``rare,'' that it is ``grand'' where it is
normally ``petit.'' They might also mumble something about it being
``style Napoleon III'' or ``style Louis XV,'' and hope you don't
notice the word ``style,'' meaning, of course, that it is a copy.
</P>
<P>
   If the brocanteur doesn't offer you a reduction, you are obliged
to ask the magic question: ``Vous pouvez faire un petit prix?''
(Roughly, ``Can you give me a good deal?'')
</P>
<P>
   This will either disarm them or inspire them to speak English:
``Mais, it's cheap!''
</P>
<P>
   At this point it sometimes works to point out legitimate flaws,
like chips or a bad finish. (If your vocabulary runs out, remember
the art of frowning and pointing.)
</P>
<P>
   If all else fails, try ``Quel est votre dernier prix?'' (``What
is your final price?'') Dropping an overinflated price by at least
10 percent is a gesture, or ``un geste'' and nearly obligatory.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you can say, ``Je vais reflechir'' (``I'll think
about it'') and walk away.
</P>
<P>
   Don't be offended if he sighs loudly or mutters in your general
direction. He is letting you know that, thanks to you, he is doing
an awful lot of work.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that he might say, grumpily, ``Allez,'' and
name a better price. In the case of the cafetiere, it was $18.
Which was followed by a tsk tsk and his comment, ``Mais c'est un
cadeau'' (``It's a gift.) I handed over his hard-won francs, and
said ``merci'' for the favor.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Teresa Johnson never wanted to be a nanny. After graduating from
Oral Roberts University, she spent four years teaching band at a
Christian school in Madison, Wis. When she wanted a new teaching
job, possibly one that would take her overseas, she began her job
hunt on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somehow through my searching, nannies just came up,'' said Ms.
Johnson, 30. The site she discovered, I Love My Nanny, advertised
nanny jobs in Europe (www.ilovemynanny. com). Ms. Johnson began to
rechart her future and eventually applied for work through another
agency on line, Apple Pie, U.S.A (www.nanny.com).
</P>
<P>
   There are other nanny-related sites, like www.nannynetwork.com,
which bills itself as a listing of every agency nationwide and lets
families and nannies find phone numbers, addresses and, where
available, Web sites for agencies in their area. To help families
with tax and payroll work, there is www.nannytaxes.com.
</P>
<P>
   Today Ms. Johnson works as a nanny in East Hills, N.Y., on the
North Shore of Long Island, caring for two school-age children. She
has her own room, her own phone line and her own computer. Her
French horn, which she has played for 18 years, is tucked away for
now. She is a new breed of live-in nanny, the kind coveted by many
families and, because of the Internet, increasingly available:
college educated, at least 25 years old and accustomed to being
away from home. She was lured to the profession by the prospect of
a job in a glamorous location.
</P>
<P>
   ``It turned out that the overseas positions were filled already,
but I thought even if I didn't go overseas, maybe I could be on the
East Coast,'' said Ms. Johnson, who is thrilled to be in affluent
East Hills, a place almost as foreign to her as Europe would be.
</P>
<P>
   In the olden days of the nanny business _ that's about two years
ago _ nanny employment agencies placed classified advertisements in
local and college newspapers in the Midwest, trolling for
prospective workers. That needle-in-a-haystack approach was
expensive and inefficient. Many applicants were too young or too
inexperienced or had sketchy, uncheckable backgrounds. But the Web
is effecting some fundamental changes in nannydom.
</P>
<P>
   About 5 percent of all preschool-age children are cared for by
live-in nannies, governesses and au pairs. That's about one million
child-care workers, 125,000 of whom are placed by approximately 500
nanny employment agencies, said Mary O'Connor, president of the
International Nanny Association (www.nanny.org). Though that
represents a slim slice of the child-care pie, there are still
fewer qualified candidates than jobs. For would-be nannies and the
families who hire them, the Web may help put more employable
candidates into the mix.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Clurman, who runs Apple Pie, U.S.A., a 14-year-old agency,
put her business completely on the Web two years ago. Ms. Clurman,
who places nannies directly with families and recruits them for
other agencies, said she had more qualified nannies today than she
could place. Leigh Billingsley, a mother of two in Tustin, Calif.,
who just hired her second nanny from the Net (her first returned
home), said: ``I've had so much luck with Internet nannies. There's
an abundance of young women who are highly qualified and highly
educated.''
</P>
<P>
   Web-based agencies are increasingly functioning as
clearinghouses for many of the smaller nanny employment agencies
nationwide who rely on them for candidates. These smaller agencies
may have e-mail or simple billboard-type Web sites but many can't
receive applications from candidates and families on line.
</P>
<P>
   The Web-based agencies say they are standardizing the industry
by codifying job descriptions and raising salaries, which average
$350 a week nationwide, according to a survey of 300 readers in
Nanny News, published by Apple Pie for nannies and their employers.
Salaries in the New York metropolitan area and in other major
cities can reach $800 to $1,000 weekly.
</P>
<P>
   Salaries and job standards are well advertised on the more
sophisticated sites, which attract college graduates who, like Ms.
Johnson, may never have considered the career before. Many
candidates view a nanny position as a stop on the way to ``real
life,'' allowing them to pay off student loans and figure out
what's next.
</P>
<P>
   Recruiting on line does have a downside: it's a little too easy.
``Right around college graduation, we get tons of applications from
women who don't have jobs yet, and after hours of going through the
process with us, decide they don't want to be a nanny after all,''
said Jackie Williams, owner of I Love My Nanny. Once her agency
decides that a candidate is serious, the matching process begins.
The nannies, and the families seeking them, are screened.
</P>
<P>
   The Web makes it easier for agencies to do background checks,
too. Digging deeply _ tracing a phone number or address of a
reference or verifying a college degree or the length of previous
employment _ is simplified. The International Nanny Association
warns, however, that background checks of criminal records are
limited by state and Federal laws and may not show the whole
picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finding nannies on the Internet is the very beginning,'' said
Carol Solomon, owner of the New York Nanny Center
(www.nynanny.com). Rigorous screening still involves
person-to-person contact, Ms. Solomon said.
</P>
<P>
   For qualified candidates, the process doesn't take long.
Jennifer Staszewski, a 25-year-old graduate of the University of
Wisconsin at Lacrosse, applied with Midwest Nannies
(www.mwnanny.com). Her job search lasted one month. Now she works
for a family in Short Hills, N.J.; she plans to be with them for a
year, then go to graduate school.
</P>
<P>
   While many agency owners say most of their clients learn of them
by word of mouth, families in need of nannies are also using the
Web. Some families are from remote areas where nannies and nanny
agencies are nonexistent.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Stansfield, the manager of the Merrill Lynch office in
Hanover, N.H., and his wife, Amy, administrative director of
Dartmouth's Hitchcock Medical Center, started searching for a nanny
to care for their 6-year-old son through I Love My Nanny.
Stansfield likes to use the Internet, so using it to find a nanny
was natural for him. He was directed to the site by his
sister-in-law, Ms. Billingsley in California. The Stansfields live
on a mountaintop on 60 acres; their driveway is a mile long. They
wanted their nanny to be athletic and not afraid of isolation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I give a lot of credit to the technology edge for making the
quicker match,'' said Stansfield, whose college-educated nanny,
Tara Olcott, applied through the Internet. She grew up in Vermont,
where her nearest neighbor lived a half-mile away. Isolation isn't
a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Web is attracting people who are better able to
communicate with their employers, and families are looking for
people who are more economically and educationally like
themselves,'' said Kathleen Webb of Home/Work Solutions in
Sterling, Va. Home/Work Solutions runs three Web nanny sites; one
site carries classified listings for families and nannies who want
to avoid agency fees, which range from $800 to $3,000 per placement
(www.4nannies.com).
</P>
<P>
   But the heads of Web-based agencies concede that their focus on
the Internet might make them miss out on some qualified candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can be an outstanding caregiver and not have any of the
attributes needed to get on the Internet,'' Ms. Webb said. ``Think
of `The Brady Bunch.' Do you think Alice was on the Net?''
</P>
<P>
   And Ms. Williams said, ``You don't need a Ph.D. to give a hug.''

 (Attn: Calif., Ga., N.C., Utah)   (af)  
 By KATIE HAFNER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since it was first developed in 1991 by Linus Torvalds, a
student at the University of Helsinki, the operating system called
Linux has engendered strong _ some might say fanatical _ loyalty
among a growing community of users.
</P>
<P>
   To be a Linux devotee today is a bit like being one of the early
users of the Internet, when using it required a solid technical
grounding.
</P>
<P>
   As it inches its way into the computing mainstream, Linux is
beginning to enjoy more widespread acceptance. Last month, Intel
and Netscape, along with venture capital firms, invested in Red Hat
Software, a company that sells a packaged version of Linux together
with applications.
</P>
<P>
   And rumors abound that Intel is planning investments in other
Linux companies as well. Other well-established computer companies
_ Oracle, Informix, Computer Associates, Corel Computer and IBM _
have announced plans to make products available for Linux.
</P>
<P>
   But the question remains: Is Linux for you?
</P>
<P>
   Not if you're a beginner or technically faint of heart. If the
words ``device driver'' make you nervous, you should probably stick
to Windows or Macintosh.
</P>
<P>
   But if you like to tinker, if the canned computer with bells and
whistles that everyone has seems too mundane and you want to be
impossibly hip in your choice of computing platforms, you might be
ready for a small adventure.
</P>
<P>
   Linux (rhymes with ``cynics'') is a simpler clone of the Unix
operating system, which started out in the engineering and
scientific communities in the 1970s, then migrated to large
corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, Linux found its primary users among Internet
service providers, software developers, Web sites and universities.
But in the past year or so, Linux has been showing up in some large
corporations, and it's beginning to spread, ever so slowly, to home
computers, especially for running home-based Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Part of Linux's appeal is emotional. ``If you don't want
Microsoft running your life, then you should try Linux,'' said
James Love, director of the Consumer Project on Technology in
Washington, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group, founded by Ralph
Nader, that focuses on high-technology issues.
</P>
<P>
   The dominance that Nader's group would like to combat began with
the first IBM PC in 1981, a machine that used MS-DOS, the Microsoft
Disk Operating System. Now 97 percent of all PCs run under some
flavor of operating system created by Microsoft, said Rob Enderle,
an analyst with Giga Information Group in Santa Clara, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Unix was developed by computer scientists at AT&AMP;T's Bell
Laboratories in 1969, the year Torvalds, now 28, was born. Linux,
of course, came much later, when Torvalds set out to develop a
simpler version of Unix that could run on a PC.
</P>
<P>
   The sheer fun and challenge also attracted Torvalds. ``He did it
for the hack value,'' said Eric Raymond, a programmer who is a
well-known Linux evangelist.
</P>
<P>
   The grass-roots spread of Linux emerged through Internet-based
newsgroups and mailing lists around the world. Linux adherents say
their operating system is simply better than Windows. It is, they
point out, powerful, fast, stable and _ best of all _ free.
Although most new computers come bundled with Windows, upgrading to
Windows 98 from Windows 95 costs around $100.
</P>
<P>
   Even better, all the information surrounding it is completely
open, even its source code, the technical blueprint for an
operating system. That means that anyone can tinker with it to
customize or improve the system and can disseminate their
variations.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the reasons people like Linux is a lot like why they
find the Internet so cool,'' Love said. ``There's no owner, no Bill
Gates and no AT&AMP;T. It's owned by the community of people who use
it.''
</P>
<P>
   And it is getting easier to use. ``When it first came into
existence, the only person who knew how to use it was Linus,'' said
Larry Augustin, president of VA Research, a computer supplier in
Mountain View, Calif., that sells machines with Linux installed.
``He posted it, and there were five other people in the world who
could figure it out. And two months later, there were 25 people in
the world who could figure it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, according to industry estimates, some seven million
people worldwide use Linux, and that number is doubling every year.
</P>
<P>
   The spread of Linux is often likened to the evolution of the
Internet. Throughout the 1970s and 80s, the Internet was navigable
only through arcane commands, all text, filled with exclamation
marks and abbreviations. Then came the World Wide Web and its
visual point-and-click browsers, its graphical user interfaces.
Much the same is happening with Linux. Graphical user interfaces
for Linux are springing up everywhere, with each new one easier to
use than the last.
</P>
<P>
   One obstacle to any wider acceptance of Linux is the relative
scarcity of commercial applications like word processors, checkbook
programs and so on. By contrast, there are more than 100,000
applications available for Windows.
</P>
<P>
   And, perhaps not surprisingly, Microsoft has no plans to develop
applications for Linux, said Jon DeVaan, vice president for
Microsoft's desktop applications division.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the only software available for Linux was freeware,
programs and applications written by Linux enthusiasts and
distributed for little or no charge. The commercial sector has only
recently begun developing Linux software, and the number of
commercial programs is beginning to grow.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're beginning to see an explosion of innovation in the Linux
platform,'' Love said.
</P>
<P>
   Linux-based word-processing programs and spreadsheets, and even
a photo manipulation program, are available. Netscape makes a Linux
version of its Web browser. Corel plans to begin selling
Wordperfect 8.0 for Linux soon; it says the price will be somewhere
between $59 and $99.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're doing word processing, writing letters, sending
e-mail or cruising the Internet, you can do it perfectly easily in
a Linux environment,'' said Geof Myers, a software engineer and
Linux fan in Woodstock, Ga. ``Not only that, you can do it on a
cheaper machine.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The reason for that, Myers said, is that the operating system
requires less powerful hardware than Windows 98. Linux can be
installed on older computers, including those with a 486 processor,
for example.
</P>
<P>
   Myers recently installed Linux on a machine he bought for his
mother-in-law to use for e-mail and word processing. He built the
computer for $75. Myers said she used the computer without
difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   The dearth of games for Linux is perhaps more of a problem. With
a handful of notable exceptions _ Doom, Quake, several versions of
Solitaire and a few others _ the number of commercial games for
Linux remains small.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond pointed out that Linux had hundreds of free games of its
own, ranging from arcade-style shoot-'em-ups to complex multiplayer
strategy games. ``They're not as slick as the commercial ones, but
they're often more interesting,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Linux's speed is attracting teen-age gamers who play Doom on
the Net. ``Fourteen-year-olds playing multiplayer Doom are
upgrading to Linux to compete better,'' said Bob Young, president
of Red Hat, in Durham, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   An increasing number of specialized computer suppliers offer
machines with Linux installed. VA Research's machines range in
price from $1,200 to $40,000. Augustin said that 10 percent of the
orders were from home users. The rest are corporate and academic
customers.
</P>
<P>
   By and large, however, you have to go out of your way to buy a
computer running Linux. It would not be possible, for instance, to
walk into CompUSA, slap down a credit card and buy a Dell Computer
loaded with Linux.
</P>
<P>
   To test computer manufacturers' willingness to sell a PC
installed with Linux, Love and Nader sent a letter in September to
Dell, asking if they might buy two computers configured with Linux.
The computer manufacturer replied that they would need to purchase
a minimum of 50 such machines.
</P>
<P>
   Young believes that companies like Dell will soon begin offering
Linux as an option. ``I'm reasonably comfortable assuring you that
you'll be able to get one within the next three months,'' Young
said.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Apple says it has no plans to sell computers
preconfigured with Linux.
</P>
<P>
   But you can walk into many computer and consumer electronics
stores now and walk out with a $49 CD-ROM for installing Linux on a
PC.
</P>
<P>
   Although the operating system itself is free, the CD-ROM, sold
by Red Hat, also contains a collection of applications, Netscape's
browser for Linux, a graphical user interface and several games.
Red Hat throws in a 300-page printed manual and 90 days' of
technical support as well.
</P>
<P>
   Caldera Systems, a software company in Orem, Utah, sells a Linux
CD-ROM similar to Red Hat's, also for $49. It is also possible to
download a panoply of Linux software, including the operating
system itself, directly off the Net.
</P>
<P>
   Linux can be made to run on a PC in lieu of Windows. It can also
be installed so the computer runs in ``dual boot'' mode, which
means that when the computer starts up, the user is given the
option of running Windows or Linux. Macintosh users can also
install Linux.
</P>
<P>
   But installation can be a challenge, requiring some knowledge of
the workings of a computer. ``I wouldn't recommend that my mom
install Linux,'' said Ben Drasin, a programmer in Cary, N.C., who
uses Linux. ``While you're installing, it will ask you things like
what kind of video card you have, and what resolution your video
card is displaying. If that's troubling to you, then installing
Linux is not something you'll be very happy with.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the system is up and running, it is likely to suffer far
fewer crashes than Windows, its users say. Linux fans send reports
to one another of machines that run continuously for months, even
years, without crashing.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Hysom, a graduate student at Emory University in Atlanta
who is gradually converting to Linux, said he would recommend that
people use a dual boot machine until they felt comfortable enough
with Linux as their sole platform. ``With pretty much any OS, the
more you use it, the more you get used to it, and the easier it
becomes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As Linux becomes easier to use, it continues to seed the user
community in important ways. College students, for example, are
taking to Linux in increasing numbers. ``Linux is everywhere on
campuses these days,'' said Raymond. ``You can't go anywhere with a
significant computer science department and not trip over a lot of
Linux users.'' When they graduate, those young users will take
Linux out into the world with them.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Linux fans at Emory University held a Linux
install-a-thon, with installations for anyone who wanted them. The
purpose, Hysom said, was to generate interest on the campus for
students who wanted to use Linux but didn't feel comfortable
installing it themselves.
</P>
<P>
   All things considered, it's probably best for most home computer
users to wait a bit, perhaps nine months to a year, before taking
the Linux plunge. By then, computers with Linux installed will be
easier to find, the system will be easier to install and use, and
software to run on it will be more plentiful.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting better faster than Windows is,'' Love said. ``The
graphical user interfaces are getting better faster, and some of us
are thinking that a year from now, they will be way better.''

MAC PROGRAM THAT BRINGS OUT THE BARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
(jt) 
 By J.D. BIERSDORFER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Writing is easy,'' Gene Fowler once observed. ``All you do is
stare at a blank piece of paper until drops of blood form on your
forehead.'' These days, a freshly created word-processing file on a
computer screen takes the place of the blank page as an object of
terror for most writers, but The Fear remains. Now, if only there
was a computer program that would actually do the writing for you
...
</P>
<P>
   Enter McPoet.
</P>
<P>
   While it probably won't actually generate your novel (or
newspaper story; believe me, it's been tried), this nifty little
Macintosh application is billed as a ``prose generation, morphing
and deconstruction tool,'' and is capable of cranking out its own
computerized compositions or transforming text you've given it into
a variety of literary styles.
</P>
<P>
   While this is not what Jack Kerouac had in mind when he
rhapsodized about spontaneous prose, armed with intensive word
lists and algorithms, McPoet does the typing and thinking for you.
It allows its user to sit back and contemplate the meaning of it
all _ and maybe ignite a few creative sparks to burn away that
writer's block as you go along.
</P>
<P>
   McPoet, which can be downloaded from the Web at the Info-Mac
Digest (digester.et.tudelft.nl/IM100-16.html(NU)item33), was also
included on the CD-ROM accompanying the October issue of MacAddict
magazine. The program is free.
</P>
<P>
   Created with Hypertalk, a Macintosh scripting language, McPoet
takes up little hard drive space, about 4 megabytes. It's easy to
operate, with a colorful interface and playful sound effects. With
one menu command, you can have the program write a poem. It even
politely asks how many lines you'd like. Or, you can type in your
own efforts, and McPoet gives you a selection of literary styles to
choose from, including Shakespeare, Kant, the Bible or Dadaist.
</P>
<P>
   The program, in fact, classifies itself as ``dadaware'' and
keeping with the spirit of the Dadaist movement, offers a quote
from the poet Tristan Tzara on its opening screen after McPoet is
installed: ``And here you are a writer, infinitely original and
endowed with a sensibility that is charming though beyond the
understanding of the vulgar.''
</P>
<P>
   Dadaism, a somewhat cynical artistic movement begun in the early
20th century, rejected the accepted notions of beauty and society
in favor of anarchy and art and literature created by chance or
accident. In fact, legend has it that the movement's very name,
which is French, from dada, a child's word for a horse, was
randomly selected from a dictionary.
</P>
<P>
   The rigid tone of software copyrights is a prime target for this
program. ``In homage to its Dadaist roots, I explicitly renounce
any copyright to McPoet,'' states the program's author, Chris
Westbury, in the documentation. ``This means that McPoet can be
distributed in any way by anybody for any reason. Everything in it
can be stolen, altered, bought, sold, re-used, re-distributed, and
published in any form. You may use McPoet and its output for
anything whatsoever.''
</P>
<P>
   Could it be a mere coincidence with the nonconformist Dadaist
outlook that McPoet is a Macintosh-only program?
</P>
<P>
   Westbury, a 35-year-old neuropsychologist working as a
post-doctoral research fellow at the University of Alberta, holds
several college degrees, including a B.A. in philosophy with a
minor in computer science. He became interested in randomly
generated computer texts while in high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``A friend of mine came to see me holding a sheet of paper that
was covered with computer-printed words, a few of which he had
circled,'' Westbury said by e-mail. ``He had written a program in
Basic on the school's Radio Shack TRS-80 (16K of RAM!) which simply
printed out words randomly, then had read through the output and
circled any pairs or triplets of words which happened to be
interesting. I was 16 or 17 at the time and was already fascinated
by how thoroughly random the world is, a fascination which has not
subsided to this day, so I found the program very intriguing.''
</P>
<P>
   Random-word association is a familiar recurring idea in pop
culture, judging from the works of the Dadaist poets in the 1920s
to the ``cut-up'' creations of William Burroughs decades later, to
the scores of refrigerators today across the country sporting free
verse gems from Magnetic Poetry kits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was always obvious to me that computers could do this
better than people,'' said Westbury. ``So as soon as I bought my
first computer I started working on McPoet. I've been working on it
_ rather more sporadically than I would like _ ever since.''
</P>
<P>
   Although McPoet is a passion for his spare time, Westbury's work
at the university shares some common ground. ``My research involves
trying to understand how language is instantiated in the brain, by
studying brain-damaged patients, running experiments on normals,
and using functional brain-imaging techniques,'' he said. ``My
research is not entirely unrelated to the interests that lead me to
write McPoet. I am particularly interested in lexical semantics; or
how people access meaning through words.''
</P>
<P>
   Westbury readily invites McPoet users to send in samples of the
program's output. ``The best line I have ever been sent is probably
this definition from Tim Rossiter, an artist in England: debt: the
money of error,'' he said. ``My own favorite short line is perhaps
this one, which sounds like something right out of Simone Weil's
notebooks:
</P>
<P>
   God is
</P>
<P>
   optimized
</P>
<P>
   where
</P>
<P>
   the
</P>
<P>
   natural laws
</P>
<P>
   compel
</P>
<P>
   events
</P>
<P>
   When you get into it, McPoet somehow defies categorization.
Whether art object, diffuser of brain gridlock or computerized
performance art, its creator takes it all in stride.
</P>
<P>
   ``McPoet has constructed many lines which made me laugh and
wonder,' Westbury wrote in the McPoet manual. ``Perhaps ultimately
the program is good for nothing other than this. I do not believe
that one could ask much more of anything in life.''

L.A.   DESIGNER   WINS FASHION AWARD

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Love it or hate it, L.A.'s got style.
</P>
<P>
   Here, in the city of angels, movie stars and ``Baywatch'' babes,
fashion designers are known for clothing with edge and attitude.
</P>
<P>
   One of the front-runners this year is Trina Turk, the
37-year-old L.A. sportswear designer who was named CaliforniaMart's
Designer of the Year at a black-tie gala Sunday night at the
Beverly Hilton Hotel in Beverly Hills.
</P>
<P>
   A young designer who puts a '90s twist on Grace Kelly-esque
classics for clients such as Sharon Stone, Drew Barrymore and Lisa
Kudrow, Turk didn't forget her hometown when she received her
crystal trophy. ``Thanks to the city of Los Angeles. It's a great
place, and I find inspiration here every day,'' she told the
audience. And she means it.
</P>
<P>
   Away from the podium she said, ``The L.A. fashion industry is on
the upswing. It's a place where you can dress to express yourself,
and the city accepts it.''
</P>
<P>
   Since she started her own business three years ago, Turk's line
of sporty womenswear that bears her name has a reputation for fine
fit and workmanship. She admires Calvin Klein's simplicity of line
and Jean Paul Gaultier's original take on classics.
</P>
<P>
   Turk competed against four other high-profile local designers
nominated by members of the fashion press. They were Judy Rabineau
for Mica, William B., Rozae Nichols, and Gregg and Holly Fiene of
XOXO.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate category, Cynthia Vincent of St. Vincent was
honored with the Rising Star Award for growth potential in the
fashion industry. She hugged everyone in sight, waved her trophy
and thanked Ron Herman for giving her a start at his store and
Mayor Richard Riordan for finally recognizing the local fashion
industry by attending the event.
</P>
<P>
   Vincent, who's known for glamorous Valley girl ensembles,
competed against nominees Dana Dartez of 26 Red Sugar, William Sung
and Betty Kim of Bette Paige, Monah Li, and Shawn Janet and Craig

   The New York Times's computer football ranking is based on an
analysis of each team's scores with emphasis on three factors: who
won, by what margin and against what quality of opposition. The
quality of an opponent is determined by examining its record
against other teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Times's computer model collapses runaway scores and takes
note of a home-field advantage. Recent games count more than
earlier games.
</P>
<P>
   The top team is assigned a rating of 1.000; the ratings of all
other teams are percentages reflecting their strength relative to
the top team. This week, for example, there is a fairly small
difference between Denver (no. 1) and Minnesota (2), and a somewhat
larger difference between Jacksonville (3) and New England (4).

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Casual Italian restaurants continue to crop up
around the Southland, enticing diners to indulge in authentic as
well as Americanized versions of Italian cuisine. Romano's Macaroni
Grill in Thousand Oaks in the Promenade shopping center joined the
Italian restaurant ranks almost two years ago, and business is
booming. Waits at prime dinner hours range from 45 minutes to an
hour.
</P>
<P>
   Although the restaurant is fairly new to this area, the Macaroni
Grill concept is a decade old. The first restaurant was established
in 1988 in Leon Springs, Texas (near San Antonio), by founder Phil
Romano. A year later, the restaurant was acquired by Brinker
International, a company that owns and operates 800 restaurants
under nine different names, including Chili's Grill &AMP; Bar,
Cozumel's Coastal Mexican Grill, On the Border Mexican Cafe,
Maggiano's Little Italy and the Corner Bakery.
</P>
<P>
   Since it started, Macaroni Grill has grown to include 116
restaurants in 33 states and Canada. Other Southern California
locations include Santa Clarita, Monrovia, Irvine, Torrance, Aliso
Viejo and Palm Desert.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Hargrove, public relations manager of Dallas-based Brinker
International, attributes the restaurant's popularity to the
generous portions, affordable prices and delicious dishes that
appeal to guests.
</P>
<P>
   Open for lunch and dinner, Macaroni Grill diners can choose from
more than 35 menu selections along with five daily specials ranging
from appetizers, pizzas and salads to meat, chicken, fish and pasta
dishes. To take advantage of the freshest vegetables, seasonings
and produce available, menus change seasonally.
</P>
<P>
   Hargrove said the restaurant's most popular dishes include
Scaloppine di Pollo (chicken breast, mushroom, artichoke, capers
and pancetta in lemon butter with pasta); Penne Rustica (shrimp,
grilled chicken and pancetta in a creamy cheese sauce with
Parmesan); Bella Napoli (Italian pasta chips, sausage, olives,
peppers, tomato, onion, mozzarella and Parmesan in Asiago cream
sauce); Pizza Margherita (tomato sauce, mozzarella, fresh tomato,
oregano and basil); Insalata Italiana (mixed greens, garbanzo
beans, salami, mushroom, tomato, onion, mozzarella and fontina
cheese); and Gamberetti e Pinoli (shrimp, mushrooms, pine nuts,
spinach and lemon butter with pasta).
</P>
<P>
   They are prepared in display kitchens (where diners can watch
the food being made) in the Thousand Oaks location with Antonio
Iocchi, executive chef, at the helm. Iocchi, a native of Rome who
has worked as a chef in Italy and around Europe, has been in this
country five years _ and with Macaroni Grill for the past two
years.
</P>
<P>
   He describes Macaroni Grill as a family-oriented classic Italian
trattoria serving American-influenced Italian cuisine _ some with
authentic flavors, others with more liberties taken. Iocchi sums it
up: ``Good Italian food at moderate prices.'' At dinner, pastas
range from $7.29 (spaghetti Bolognese) to $12.49 (linguine alla
pescatora); antipasti from $4.29 (mozzarella alla marinara) to
$8.99 (a dozen New Zealand green lip mussels); fish dishes from
$9.99 (linguine all vongole) to $12.29 (scaloppine di salmone);
chicken dishes from $9.79 (petti di pollo pepe) to $11.29
(scaloppine di pollo); and pizzas from $7.29 to $7.49 each.
</P>
<P>
   A house salad with your entree is an additional 99 cents, but
other salads run the gamut from $2.99 (spinach) to $8.29 (grilled
chicken Caesar). Grilled lamb chops and a rib-eye steak are the
most expensive menu items at $16.99 each.
</P>
<P>
   ``On Fridays and Saturdays, we do 1,000 meals per day,'' said
Iocchi, whose favorite dishes on the menu are the thin-crusted
Neapolitan-style pizzas baked in a wood-burning oven.
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant takes no reservations. However, if you call
before leaving home, you can request that your name be added to the
priority seating list, and when you arrive your wait should be
considerably less _ hopefully only 10 or 15 minutes, said Hargrove.
</P>
<P>
   Several colleagues and friends tipped us off about the tasty
dishes we'd find at Macaroni Grill _ and they were right on the
mark. Today we are offering copycat versions of three dishes
sampled during a recent lunch so you can re-create them at home.
Included are an appetizer, sandwich and pasta.
</P>
<P>
   The baked seafood appetizer _ which is called Crema di Mare on
the menu _ is rich, creamy and loaded with seafood _ definitely not
diet fare. Although not a dish served in Italy _ ``We don't use
much cheese or cream with seafood there,'' noted chef Iocchi _ it
is a winner. Our version requires making a white sauce on top of
the stove and then tossing in some Asiago cheese along with quickly
cooked scallops, cooked shrimp and chopped clams. For ease and
convenience, we used canned clams. Look for the Asiago cheese _ a
semifirm Italian cheese with a rich, nutty flavor _ at Trader Joe's
or other markets that sell specialty cheeses.
</P>
<P>
   Turn the mixture into a pie plate and pop into the oven for a
quick bake. The restaurant serves the dip with pasta chips _ made
from fried won ton skins _ but we found it delicious with crackers,
tortilla or pita chips. We've included directions for making the
pasta chips, but they're a hassle and require extra time in the
kitchen. If time is at a premium, go the store-bought chip or
cracker route.
</P>
<P>
   The Bowtie Noodles With Sun-Dried Tomatoes, Olives and Feta was
a special the day we dined at the restaurant. The dish is easy to
duplicate at home _ and great for busy cooks in a hurry. Simply
cook the noodles and then toss with julienned strips of sun-dried
tomatoes (to save on cutting time, purchase the tomatoes already in
strips), Kalamata olives pieces, olive oil, pine nuts (toast them
fast in the microwave oven 30 to 60 seconds), feta cheese and
seasonings. If time is short, you can save a little by using sliced
ripe olives instead of the Kalamatas. Granted, the flavor will
suffer a bit _ but only the cook will know. Serve over tossed
greens, and dinner is ready to serve!
</P>
<P>
   The Portobello Mushroom Panini is a wonderful sandwich. Although
not difficult to make, it's the most time-consuming of today's
trio. Marinate portobello mushrooms in a balsamic vinaigrette and
then broil and slice. Meanwhile, whip up a Sun-Dried Tomato
Mayonnaise to add wonderful flavor. We've used sourdough bread
slices for the sandwiches, as we found they worked better than the
focaccia we were able to buy, but suit yourself.
</P>
<P>
   The sandwiches are stacked with red onion slices, roasted red
pepper strips (from a jar to speed preparation), mushroom slices,
arugula and smoked mozzarella cheese (we found at Gelson's) and the
special mayo in between. Grill the sandwiches on both sides in a
little butter _ or toast under the broiler _ and you're in for a
fabulous, flavorful treat.
</P>
<P>
   Jazz up your menus with these creations. If you can't get in the
mood to make them at home, head for Macaroni Grill. Either way,
you're in for some tasty dining. &QL;

   Use as chips for dipping into baked seafood appetizer. Makes
enough dip and won ton chips for 6 to 8 servings.
</P>
<P>
   NOTE: If you don't feel inclined to fry the won ton skins to
make chips, the seafood appetizer is also delicious served with
tortilla or pita chips or crackers of your choice.

DIGITAL MAGIC: FROM TEEN-AGE WITCH TO BARBIE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
(jt) 
 By MICHELLE SLATALLA    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   I was far too young to appreciate the stir that the Beatles
caused when they landed in America, so I missed out on the early
training that might have better prepared me for celebrity worship.
By the time I glimpsed someone famous nearby _ Warren Beatty in a
restaurant _ I was already an adult and felt no urge to (1) scream
hysterically, (2) run up to him and sob, ``I love you,'' or (3) rip
out my own hair.
</P>
<P>
   But one day last spring, I took my daughters to see a Broadway
show and got a firsthand view of how the famous can enthrall even
the very young. As we settled into our seats, Zoe, 9, and Ella, 7,
were sneaking frantic looks over their shoulders. The object of
their attention appeared to be a young blond woman chatting with a
friend in the row behind us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her,'' Ella gasped.
</P>
<P>
   Zoe whispered through clenched teeth: ``Autograph. Now.''
</P>
<P>
   With a stalker's glint in her eye, Ella turned and blurted:
``Are you 
Melissa-Joan-Hart-from-the-TV-show-and-if-so-can-I-have-your--autogr
aph? Please.''
</P>
<P>
   That was my introduction to ``Sabrina the Teen-age Witch,'' the
popular weekly television show, and its star, Melissa Joan Hart,
whose on-screen attempts to control the forces of magic and
adolescence have earned her the loyalty and adoration of millions
of little girls. Ms. Hart obligingly scrawled ``All My Love,
Melissa Joan Hart'' on the back of an old grocery receipt for my
daughters. For the rest of the evening, Zoe and Ella peeked at the
crumpled paper, which in the months since has been solemnly passed
back and forth between them.
</P>
<P>
   Sabrina clearly had magic powers over my children, which is why
I decided to investigate the character's leap from one
entertainment medium to another. The television witch has become
the star of a $35 computer game for either Macintosh or Windows
machines. While plenty of animated television characters have made
the transition to the desktop, Sabrina leads the charge among
flesh-and-blood sitcom characters. Would she lose something in the
translation?
</P>
<P>
   I hoped not, because I confess that I have become attached to
Sabrina myself in the past few months. I felt some comfort watching
the show with Zoe and Ella, remembering how I had spent my own
childhood in thrall to novels about similarly plucky,
one-dimensional heroines like Trixie Belden, girl detective, and
Cherry Ames, World War II nurse. I loved them because they always
attempted the impossible _ and even when they failed, they were
better off for trying.
</P>
<P>
   So the three of us were excited when we installed the Sabrina
the Teen-age Witch game on my Micron Millenia. We huddled in front
of the screen, listening to the voice of Penn Jillette (the
magician who plays Drell, head of the Witches' Council, on the
show) tell us how to win. The goal is to earn a witch's license by
helping the animated Sabrina cast seven spells, based on clues and
secret ingredients hidden throughout the rooms of Sabrina's house
and school.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, we need to figure out how to turn that pulsating orange
gourd back into Sabrina,'' I said. ``Looks like fun.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Zoe, you're hogging the mouse,'' Ella said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my turn, Ella.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mom, Zoe is hogging the mouse.''
</P>
<P>
   Figuring they would work it out by following an on-screen
example _ after all, Sabrina's attempts to learn magic are little
more than a thinly veiled metaphor for learning how to get along in
life _ I left them alone for 10 minutes while I picked up my
husband at the train station.
</P>
<P>
   When I returned, I found them on the couch, watching ``Rugrats''
on television.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened to the game?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ugghh,'' Ella said.
</P>
<P>
   Zoe translated: ``Sabrina in the game doesn't look like Melissa
Joan Hart. She looks kind of like Barbie. So we don't want to help
her that much.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe you should have had them test the new Rugrats game
instead,'' my husband said helpfully.
</P>
<P>
   I would probably have abandoned the animated Sabrina at that
point if not for the fact that I had been charmed by the amusing
dialogue supplied by the voices of Ms. Hart and Nick Bakay as Salem
the campy Talking Cat, by the faithfulness of the plot line to the
television show and by the hunch I had about where to find the
magic vacuum to free Sabrina from a loveless existence as a gourd.
</P>
<P>
   So the next day, I phoned Ms. Hart to enlist her help in luring
my daughters back to the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you remember who your own role model was when you were
little?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Madonna.''
</P>
<P>
   I decided to try a different tack. ``What advice would you have
for two little girls who love the character of Sabrina but think
the game is too hard and the animated image of Sabrina looks like
Barbie?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I haven't actually played the game myself,'' Ms. Hart
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``All right then, what advice would Sabrina give?'' I was
getting desperate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, she would say that if she just tried it a couple more
times, she would start to pick it up,'' Ms. Hart said. ``Sometimes
things seem hard and frustrating, but if you keep at them, you
figure out how they work.''
</P>
<P>
   That night at dinner, my daughters wanted to know if I really
got to talk to Melissa Joan Hart and if so, did I ask all the
questions they had written down for me before they went to school
that morning: Was it true she had recently cut her hair? Did she
remember meeting them at ``The Lion King''? Did she want them to
come out and help her with the show?
</P>
<P>
   I said I had talked to her and the answers were yes, yes (not
true, but the truth would have crushed them) and no.
</P>
<P>
   After a couple of minutes, Zoe said, ``Ella, I was thinking that
if you cast a spell on the broom in the kitchen closet, it might
turn into a vacuum.''
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, but don't hog the mouse.''
</P>
<P>
   Trixie Belden would have been proud.

 By PETER H. LEWIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For computer users, some of the more startling revelations in
the Starr report have nothing to do with sex.
</P>
<P>
   Footnotes in the report from the Office of the Independent
Counsel include such phrases as ``document recovered from Ms.
Lewinsky's home computer,'' ``e-mail retrieved from Catherine
Davis' computer'' and ``deleted file from Ms. Lewinsky's home
computer.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the ways Kenneth Starr's investigators peered into the
private lives of their subjects was to peer into their computers.
What they were able to find, and the ease with which they found it,
may prompt computer users to re-evaluate their computer practices.
</P>
<P>
   Word processing software, Web browsing software and electronic
mail have become integral to all sorts of communications, both
professional and personal. As a result, many people have files on
their hard disks that they wish to keep private, like love letters,
confidential business documents or financial data.
</P>
<P>
   And many people have sensitive, confidential and potentially
embarrassing files in their computers that they do not know are
there, either because they think that the files have been erased or
because they are unaware that certain common programs on the
computer automatically keep a log of what the user does.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recovering files that were deleted from a computer directory
is a trivial process,'' said Joel R. Reidenberg, a professor at the
Fordham University School of Law in New York who specializes in
privacy issues. He said a related issue was the computer's creation
of sensitive files that the user often did not know were there in
the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``The user's Web browser will create files, unbeknownst to the
user, that record all their interactions,'' Reidenberg said. ``Many
people today know about cookie files, but the browser creates a
history file as well that keeps a record of the Web sites the user
visits. And then there's a cache file that sometimes even keeps
copies of the pictures that have been downloaded.''
</P>
<P>
   More obscure are the temporary files created by word processors,
for example, and the so-called swap files that an operating system
creates as a way to manage computer memory. These files often
remain readable even if the original files are erased.
</P>
<P>
   In computers, being safe can sometimes lead to being sorry, as
Oliver L. North discovered in the Iran-contra investigation in the
Reagan administration, when incriminating files he thought had been
deleted were later resurrected from network backup tapes.
</P>
<P>
   In the current Justice Department investigation of the Microsoft
Corp., e-mail messages and memorandums from long ago are being
resurrected from computer disks and cited as crucial evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The great majority of computer users have little reason to
believe that their computer files will be scrutinized by
law-enforcement agents, corporate and government spies, or even
special investigators. But what about unscrupulous co-workers or
curious children or computer thieves? What confidential information
resides on the hard disk of the computer that was donated to
charity, sold at a yard sale or accidentally left on the commuter
train?
</P>
<P>
   Examples abound of sensitive information going out the door when
government agencies, pharmacies, doctors' offices and other
businesses donate or sell used computers without erasing the
computers' memories.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, for example, a woman in Nevada bought a used computer
from an Internet auction company and was surprised to find that it
contained names, addresses, Social Security numbers and
prescription information for 2,000 people, including people being
treated for AIDS, alcoholism and mental illnesses. A pharmacy had
failed to erase the information when it sold the computer.
</P>
<P>
   The rise in the number of computer thefts and the increased
sharing of computers in the home are confronting consumers with
security issues that in the past were issues only for big
corporations, banks, the military and government agencies, said
Steve Solomon, chief executive of Citadel Technology Inc., a
security software company in Dallas whose products include
Winshield and Folderbolt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's moving down into the small office and home office
markets, to schools and to home computer users,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   How does one keep confidential information private? And when the
information is no longer needed, how does one make sure that it is
completely erased? Both questions involve a combination of good
computer security policies and good security software.
</P>
<P>
   The software is the easy part. Creating and sticking with good
security habits is the hard part.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technology exists today to protect individual privacy for as
long as the individual chooses to keep the information private,''
said Scott Schnell, senior vice president of marketing at RSA Data
Security of San Mateo, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Computer users today have access to inexpensive software tools
that can encrypt the contents of a file (including images), an
e-mail message or even the entire contents of a computer so
thoroughly that it can never be read by someone else in our
lifetimes.
</P>
<P>
   Other programs can shred unwanted files so completely that no
one can recover them. But very few people use such security tools.
</P>
<P>
   Computers are good at keeping secrets. Too good, in fact. The
secrets can reside on a computer, and on a computer network, long
after the user deletes them. The files are forgotten, but not gone.
</P>
<P>
   Deleting a file does not really delete the file. It merely hides
it from view so it no longer shows up in a directory of files. It's
like getting an unlisted telephone number. The listing may not
appear in the phone directory, but the phone can still ring if
someone knows the right number.
</P>
<P>
   When a user deletes a file, the computer stops listing it in the
file directory and marks the disk space as available for reuse.
Another file may eventually be written atop the same space,
obliterating any traces of the original. But as hard disk
capacities swell into the gigabytes, the space may not be
overwritten for a long, long time.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In that limbo period when the deleted file is undead, any
moderately skilled computer user can locate, restore and read the
deleted file by using such commands as ``undelete'' or ``unerase,''
which are common features of many software utilities.
</P>
<P>
   The computer's ability to remember deleted files is most often a
good thing, especially when important files have been deleted by
accident. Every day, computer technicians get frantic calls from
people who have inadvertently erased the boss' speech or the big
presentation due the next morning, or who have children who have
erased those boring Quicken folders to make room on the disk for
games. At those moments, being able to resurrect the files from the
dead seems like a miracle.
</P>
<P>
   There are a number of utility programs available that have an
``unerase'' capability, to be used both in emergencies and as a
precaution against accidents. Examples include Norton Utilities
from the Symantec Corp.
</P>
<P>
   But as with most tools, ``unerase'' programs can be dangerous in
the wrong hands.
</P>
<P>
   To truly erase a file and prevent it from being recovered, one
must write over it, or wipe it. There are several utility programs
available that enable the user to overwrite a single file or the
entire disk, or anything in between.
</P>
<P>
   Such programs typically have apocalyptic names, such as
Shredder, Flame File and Burn. Similar disk-wiping tools are often
included in PC utility programs and encryption programs, but others
are available for downloading without charge from the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   These programs typically hash over the designated disk space
with meaningless patterns of ones and zeroes, instead of the
meaningful patterns of ones and zeroes that represent the original
information. That process renders the deleted file unreadable in
most cases.
</P>
<P>
   The key phrase is ``in most cases.'' Just as with encryption,
there are people working just as hard to recover wiped files as
there are people working to wipe them. Law-enforcement agencies and
spies have developed ways to reverse a simple, one-pass wipe with
ones and zeroes and retrieve the original file.
</P>
<P>
   So the federal government requires that sensitive files be wiped
many times with random characters, which, in theory, obliterates
the original file and makes it unrecoverable.
</P>
<P>
   Unless, of course, the file has already been copied onto backup
tapes. In the digital world, the original file may be shredded,
while one or more perfect copies can exist elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   An even more bulletproof way to render files unreadable is to
encrypt them.
</P>
<P>
   Encryption scrambles a disk or file, including pictures (or a
telephone conversation, or a credit card sent over the Internet) so
it can be opened and read only by the person holding the proper
key, or password. The strength of the encryption is often measured
by the length of the key, which is in turn measured in bits. In
general, each additional bit of key length doubles the amount of
effort needed for unauthorized users to break the key.
</P>
<P>
   Even weak encryption (with a 40-bit key length, for example) is
sufficient to deter most casual snoops. Breaking a 56-bit key
requires computing resources that are beyond the reach of all but
the most determined code breakers, and even then it can require
days of sustained attacks by a supercomputer just to crack one
e-mail message.
</P>
<P>
   (The government's National Security Agency, by far the most
formidable group of code breakers on the planet, is thought to be
able to break 56-bit keys in a much shorter time, said Enrique
Salem, a chief technology officer at Symantec, whose products
include Disk Lock, Norton Your Eyes Only, and Norton Secret Stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Some encryption programs available today use 1,024- or 2,048-bit
keys, which are ``infinitely unbreakable, at least in our
lifetimes, even taking into consideration the predictable advances
in computing power,'' said Schnell of RSA. In other words, it is
more secure than the strongest physical vault ever built. Not even
the National Security Agency is believed to have the ability to
break a 1,024-bit key.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is e-mail. People type all sorts of embarrassing,
confidential or intemperate words in e-mail in the mistaken belief
that such messages are private. In reality, messages sent by e-mail
are less secure than messages scribbled on a postcard.
</P>
<P>
   The way the Internet mail system works, an e-mail message passes
through several exchange points, or nodes, on its way to the
recipient's computer. The system administrator at each handoff
point can in theory read the message, copy it, reroute it or tamper
with it.
</P>
<P>
   If the message originates or terminates in a corporate computer
system, chances are high that a copy will persist in the company's
backup tapes or disk for days, at least.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, there are only two ways to keep information
confidential in the digital age. One is to use strong encryption.
The other is never to write it down or speak it in the first place.

 &HT;    GEEWAX-COLUMN HAS BEEN KILLED. PLEASE USE RESEND-GEEWAX-COLUMN.
 &HT;    By Marilyn Geewax
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The woman was livid. She called the newspaper repeatedly to talk
to anyone who would listen to her rant about interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   The vehemence of her outburst seemed peculiar, considering how
tame interest rates are today. In recent weeks, the rates on
business loans, home mortgages and consumer loans have been
drifting lower, leaving millions of Americans in better financial
condition.
</P>
<P>
   So why was this woman so cranky?
</P>
<P>
   Because she is retired and lives on the interest from bank
certificates of deposit and U.S. Treasury securities. When interest
rates decline on loans, they also fall on her savings. Recently,
the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond fell below 5 percent for the
first time in the issue's 21-year history. For retirees who
remember getting double-digit yields in 1981, these may seem like
hard times.
</P>
<P>
   Though it may not be easy to think coolly when your income is
falling, people living on fixed incomes are mistaken if they
believe they'd be better off having interest rates rise.
</P>
<P>
   Rates go up in response to growing inflation. They shot up in
the late 1970s and early 1980s because lenders were trying to keep
pace with stunning leaps in wages and prices. Clearly, the economy
is in much better shape today than in 1981, when the prime lending
rate was 21.5 percent and the unemployment rate was nearly 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Today, with the prime down to 8.25 percent, the rate of
joblessness has fallen to 4.6 percent. Home mortgages are at the
lowest levels since the 1960s. And the good news for retirees is
that they are no longer getting hit with sticker shock every time
they go shopping. In fact, they are seeing many prices fall.
</P>
<P>
   The phone caller refuses to believe that. She is convinced
prices are still shooting up. For medical care and some services,
such as haircuts and dry cleaning, she may be right. But the
evidence is overwhelming that most prices are stable or falling.
For example, retail beef prices are at the lowest levels in years.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture reports that for Choice, Select
and ungraded cuts of beef, store prices averaged $2.54 per pound
during the first six months of this year, compared with $2.71 per
pound five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   That price drop is not unusual. This past summer, a gallon of
gasoline fell nearly 18 percent from the summer of 1997, coffee
dropped 11 percent and telephone bills declined 1.1 percent. Many
cars and trucks are being priced at 5 percent below last year's
models. This fall, Georgia Power Co. is seeking permission from the
Public Service Commission to lower rates for electricity; the only
argument is over how much to cut.
</P>
<P>
   But the woman on the phone was not interested in such data
because she is fixated on only one fact: Her income is declining.
She would rather see the great majority of Americans suffer with
higher mortgage payments, more expensive credit cards and longer
unemployment lines _ so she could feel more secure when she counts
her savings at the bank.
</P>
<P>
   Her point of view is selfish, but not uncommon. In coming
months, she and others who depend on bank CDs are likely to see
further cuts as the Federal Reserve Board tries to fight global
recession and price deflation. Some savers will be angry, but the
Fed must ignore their complaints. It's time to cut and cut again to
keep our country from joining Asia and Russia in an economic
crisis.

 &HT;    
 By FLORA LEWIS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    PARIS _ The United States isn't definitely deciding much of
anything these days.
 &HT;    That is partly because the Federal Reserve's Alan Greenspan and
the U.S. Treasury's Robert Rubin focus on their duty to attend to
the American economy, rather than taking the world view.
 &HT;    And it is partly because the U.S. president is forced to lower
his horizon.
 &HT;    This presidency _ and thus the United States as such _ has been
weakened in three vital ways by the continuing obsession with a
tawdry scandal of sex and lies.
 &HT;    First, it is a preoccupation, distracting time and energy from
urgent problems. Second, a caution is imposed stalling any bold
projects which might be wise and useful but not immediately popular
for fear of losing support. Third is the need to hoard clout. The
influence a president can exert and the obligations he can call in
must be focussed on what he most wants done. If he needs them to
save himself, not much is left for other projects.
 &HT;    It doesn't matter whether you believe President Clinton should
or should not be punished for his attempt to cover up his
misbehavior. The country, and as the affair drags on the world, is
being punished by the American failure to get on with vital
decisions.
 &HT;    France's Le Monde sees ``something profoundly unhealthy in this
obsession with demanding purity and transparency in a private
matter.'' Others see outrageously self-serving partisan politics or
ideological manipulation.
 &HT;    Where is the voice that can rise above all the yammer and
snickers and speak to the national interest, the world's need?
There doesn't seem to be an individual with the compelling stature,
the assured respect, to articulate with resonance the common
concern. It is not a matter of passing judgment but of renewing a
sense of national commitment and dignity, so that Washington can do
its proper job.
 &HT;    It would be salutary and refreshing if the three living and
lucid ex-presidents _ unfortunately Ronald Reagan can no longer
speak responsibly _ could jointly recall the country to its duties,
senses and needs. Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter and George Bush
disagree about a lot but they all have a serious idea of what the
presidency is for, and what the United States means to the world.
 &HT;    Eventually, historians will wonder what on earth this nasty
farce was all about and why Americans persisted so stubbornly in
disgusting themselves with titillation.
 &HT;    But it's dangerous to wait. Let the commanding voices ring out
and remind us there's a real world.
 &HT;    Clearly, among the pressing problems are those on the economic
front. At least there seems to be a general recognition that the
world financial system has drastically, and messily, outgrown the
context of its normal function. That awareness provides a little
reassurance that we aren't just headed helplessly down the drain
because nobody is making the effort to stop it, as in the 1930s.
 &HT;    But it's a source of serious discouragement to see the World
Bank and G-7 meetings come and go with no more than vague calls for
a new ``financial architecture'' and no clear proposals. Certainly
it is past time for a new Bretton Woods conference to map the
guidelines for international monetary cooperation, as was so
brilliantly done in 1944.
 &HT;    The sheer quantity of money involved and the volume of
transactions have grown overwhelming, beyond anybody's control or
capacity for defense. It is not a matter of ideology-free markets
vs. regulation.
 &HT;    No serious national economy operates without rules for banking
reliability, honest accounting and so forth. But there are no such
international rules. When a single hedge fund can owe $100 billion
gambling with some $3 billion and drag down other institutions,
nothing is reliable. It's not good enough to argue whether the
International Monetary Fund was too tough on Indonesia or too lax
with Russia.
 &HT;    There needs to be a whole new, coherent set of rules to match
the new global market. The way to develop it is to start
immediately on calling an international conference to discuss and
determine what can be agreed.
 &HT;    There are differences of approach, but a convergence of
understanding that panic can be contagious and support needs to be
organized. It was John Maynard Keynes who mapped out the principles
adopted in Bretton Woods, in response to a U.S. invitation to
create institutions to underwrite post-war recovery.
 &HT;    There isn't a Keynes on the horizon at this point. But the
essential ideas of properly maintained banking systems, financial
transparency and adequacy of assets are clear enough. The specifics
need to be debated in an international setting. What is lacking,
however, is a sponsor.
 &HT;    Other leaders have favored the idea but it will take a definite
decision by the United States to get it launched. The world is
waiting.

 By FLORA LEWIS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    PARIS _ The United States isn't definitely deciding much of
anything these days.
 &HT;    That is partly because the Federal Reserve's Alan Greenspan and
the U.S. Treasury's Robert Rubin focus on their duty to attend to
the American economy, rather than taking the world view.
 &HT;    And it is partly because the U.S. president is forced to lower
his horizon.
 &HT;    This presidency _ and thus the United States as such _ has been
weakened in three vital ways by the continuing obsession with a
tawdry scandal of sex and lies.
 &HT;    First, it is a preoccupation, distracting time and energy from
urgent problems. Second, a caution is imposed stalling any bold
projects which might be wise and useful but not immediately popular
for fear of losing support. Third is the need to hoard clout. The
influence a president can exert and the obligations he can call in
must be focussed on what he most wants done. If he needs them to
save himself, not much is left for other projects.
 &HT;    It doesn't matter whether you believe President Clinton should
or should not be punished for his attempt to cover up his
misbehavior. The country, and as the affair drags on the world, is
being punished by the American failure to get on with vital
decisions.
 &HT;    France's Le Monde sees ``something profoundly unhealthy in this
obsession with demanding purity and transparency in a private
matter.'' Others see outrageously self-serving partisan politics or
ideological manipulation.
 &HT;    Where is the voice that can rise above all the yammer and
snickers and speak to the national interest, the world's need?
There doesn't seem to be an individual with the compelling stature,
the assured respect, to articulate with resonance the common
concern. It is not a matter of passing judgment but of renewing a
sense of national commitment and dignity, so that Washington can do
its proper job.
 &HT;    It would be salutary and refreshing if the three living and
lucid ex-presidents _ unfortunately Ronald Reagan can no longer
speak responsibly _ could jointly recall the country to its duties,
senses and needs. Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter and George Bush
disagree about a lot but they all have a serious idea of what the
presidency is for, and what the United States means to the world.
 &HT;    Eventually, historians will wonder what on earth this nasty
farce was all about and why Americans persisted so stubbornly in
disgusting themselves with titillation.
 &HT;    But it's dangerous to wait. Let the commanding voices ring out
and remind us there's a real world.
 &HT;    Clearly, among the pressing problems are those on the economic
front. At least there seems to be a general recognition that the
world financial system has drastically, and messily, outgrown the
context of its normal function. That awareness provides a little
reassurance that we aren't just headed helplessly down the drain
because nobody is making the effort to stop it, as in the 1930s.
 &HT;    But it's a source of serious discouragement to see the World
Bank and G-7 meetings come and go with no more than vague calls for
a new ``financial architecture'' and no clear proposals. Certainly
it is past time for a new Bretton Woods conference to map the
guidelines for international monetary cooperation, as was so
brilliantly done in 1944.
 &HT;    The sheer quantity of money involved and the volume of
transactions have grown overwhelming, beyond anybody's control or
capacity for defense. It is not a matter of ideology-free markets
vs. regulation.
 &HT;    No serious national economy operates without rules for banking
reliability, honest accounting and so forth. But there are no such
international rules. When a single hedge fund can owe $100 billion
gambling with some $3 billion and drag down other institutions,
nothing is reliable. It's not good enough to argue whether the
International Monetary Fund was too tough on Indonesia or too lax
with Russia.
 &HT;    There needs to be a whole new, coherent set of rules to match
the new global market. The way to develop it is to start
immediately on calling an international conference to discuss and
determine what can be agreed.
 &HT;    There are differences of approach, but a convergence of
understanding that panic can be contagious and support needs to be
organized. It was John Maynard Keynes who mapped out the principles
adopted in Bretton Woods, in response to a U.S. invitation to
create institutions to underwrite post-war recovery.
 &HT;    There isn't a Keynes on the horizon at this point. But the
essential ideas of properly maintained banking systems, financial
transparency and adequacy of assets are clear enough. The specifics
need to be debated in an international setting. What is lacking,
however, is a sponsor.
 &HT;    Other leaders have favored the idea but it will take a definite
decision by the United States to get it launched. The world is
waiting.

 &HT;    COLLEGE COSTS RISING TWICE AS FAST AS INFLATION
 &HT;    Eds: Recasts final phrase in 6th graf.
 &HT;    BY NICHOLE MONROE
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ College costs are rising twice as fast as
inflation, the College Board reported Wednesday, with tuition and
fees up about 4 percent nationwide this fall, and 5 percent at
private schools.
</P>
<P>
   To meet these costs, more students are turning to unsubsidized
student loans, the board said in a report, ``Trends in College
Pricing.''
</P>
<P>
   The report said average tuition for the 1998-99 school year is
$3,243 for four-year public schools and $14,508 for four-year
private schools. That represents an average increase of $132 at the
public schools and $723 at the private schools.
</P>
<P>
   Room and board charges are rising a similar 3 to 5 percent, it
said.
</P>
<P>
   The increases continue a long trend of college costs
outstripping prices in general.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1980, tuition rises have more than doubled the inflation
rate, and the costs announced this fall are twice the 2 percent
inflation rate so far in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   College and university officials attributed soaring tuition to
the increased demand for technology in classrooms and dormitories,
decreases in state funding and colleges' slowness to reduce costs.
</P>
<P>
   The College Board also reported that financial aid reached
record levels in 1997-98. More than $60 billion was available from
federal, state and institutional sources, an increase of 6 percent
over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   However, most of the increase was in the form of unsubsidized
loans rather than grants, placing the heaviest burdens on
low-income students and those who don't complete their degrees,
said Lawrence Gladieux, executive director of policy analysis for
the College Board.
</P>
<P>
   ``The growing reliance on loans puts a disproportionate burden
on our neediest students, who were targeted for grants, not loans,
and never expected to have to borrow when these programs were
created,'' Gladieux said.
</P>
<P>
   Loans have increased in part because grants and their purchasing
power has declined. The maximum federal Pell Grant, which at its
peak in the late 1970s covered three-quarters of the cost of
attending a public four-year college, now only covers one-third.
</P>
<P>
   For families, the rising costs only highlight the importance of
saving early, said John Joyce of the College Scholarship Service,
the financial aid arm of the College Board.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many families do not realize that there are resources to help
them finance a college education,'' Joyce said. ``With careful
planning and a little homework, most families can gather a wealth
of available information and translate that into a package that
will open the doors of college for their children.''
</P>
<P>
   Joyce added that families should take advantage of newly enacted
tax benefits and other programs aimed at easing the college burden.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, President Clinton signed legislation that reduces
the interest rate on federally backed student loans to 7.46
percent, down more than half a point from last year. The bill would
also allow the maximum amount of Pell Grants for low-income
students to rise from the current $3,000 a year to $5,800 in 2003,
if Congress provides the money.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when more than half of students require financial aid
to pay for college, College Board officials acknowledged that
parents may go into ``sticker shock'' when they look at soaring
prices. However, they said that for most college graduates,
lifetime earnings repay the cost of college many times over.
</P>
<P>
   College Board President Donald Stewart noted that a majority of
students at four-year colleges pay less than $4,000 a year for
tuition and fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is that the majority of Americans often overestimate
the price of attending college and may be discouraged by those
miscalculations,'' Stewart said.

 By CLAIRE POOLE, with BRENDAN M. CASE in Mexico City, MERY
GALANTERNICK in Rio de Janeiro and ANDREA MANDEL-CAMPBELL in Buenos
Aires 
 c.1998 Latin Trade 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    The TV commercial is alluring. Shot in cult-film fashion and in
evocative black and white, the spot shows charming, sexy, casually
dressed 20-something Brazilians going about their carefree days,
reading books and taking leisurely strolls. Then comes the pitch:
``We can be different in many ways, but we all have one thing in
common: Free.''
 &HT;    No, ``Free'' isn't a line of clothing, a detergent or a
political party. It's a brand of light cigarettes made by Brazilian
cigarette giant Souza Cruz, which is controlled by British American
Tobacco, a unit of U.K.-based BAT Industries.
 &HT;    Young Latin Americans like these are the next generation for
many of the world's tobacco giants. While smoking rates in some
industrialized countries are decreasing at about 1 percent a year,
those in developing countries are increasing at around 3 percent
per year, according to a recent article in The Lancet, a U.K.-based
medical journal.
 &HT;    As a result, the big tobacco makers are targeting regions like
Latin America for their next crop of consumers. ``Latin America is
not as important as Asia or Eastern Europe,'' says Marc Cohen, a
tobacco analyst at Goldman Sachs in New York. ``But it is
growing.''
 &HT;    British American Tobacco has been the most aggressive, acquiring
stakes in companies from Mexico to Chile. It now sells more than
186 billion cigarettes a year in the region and controls half of
the market. In Nicaragua, Honduras, Trinidad and Barbados, it
controls almost the entire market. Latin America now makes up more
than 25 percent of its overall sales and almost 20 percent of its
operating profits.
 &HT;    This recent push by the big multinational tobacco companies is
alarming to such groups as the Washington, D.C.-based Pan American
Health Organization (PAHO), which is working to improve the health
and living standards of the people of the Americas.
 &HT;    In a study released in April, PAHO found that 135,000 people die
in Latin America each year from tobacco usage. The study also cited
statistics from the World Health Organization, which estimates that
one third of Latin American and Caribbean adults are smokers. That
puts the region at the same level as Canada but slightly higher
than the United States. Venezuela, the Dominican Republic and
Bolivia rank at the top of the list, while Honduras, Costa Rica and
Paraguay remain at the bottom.
 &HT;    Room to grow. While more Latin Americans smoke than their
counterparts in the United States, they smoke fewer cigarettes per
day _ 12 versus 20, according to PAHO. That gives cigarette makers
a big incentive to boost consumption among current smokers as their
real incomes rise. And with the proportion of female smokers in
Latin America (19 percent) well below that of women in Canada and
the United States (26 percent), PAHO thinks women in the region are
likely to be a prime new target for the big tobacco companies.
 &HT;    ``Women are entering the workplace and finally feel free,'' says
Jeannette Noltenius, executive director of the Latino Council on
Alcohol and Tobacco in Washington, D.C. ``And with it has come this
notion that part of that freedom is the ability to smoke.''
 &HT;    To discourage more people from taking up cigarettes, many
countries in the region have bolstered their regulatory efforts.
Almost all the countries in Latin America require fixed warnings on
the hazards of smoking on their cigarette packs, with the exception
of Brazil and Chile, which post different warnings from time to
time. But only two countries _ Chile and Mexico _ require
information on the levels of tar and nicotine to be placed on the
package.
 &HT;    Regulations on advertising, meanwhile, have been lax. Only three
Latin American countries _ Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela _ have
banned cigarette advertising on radio and television, as is the
practice in the United States and Canada. However, most countries
have put restrictions on when the ads may be broadcast, and some
even restrict their content and prospective audience.
 &HT;    It's been difficult to reign in an industry that's also a big
money maker for some Latin American countries. Three in the region
rank among the world's leading producers of raw tobacco: Brazil
(fourth), Argentina (15th) and Mexico (16th). Three more are among
the world's leading exporters of cigarettes, including Brazil
(sixth), Venezuela (16th) and Colombia (20th). Brazil alone earns
almost US$1 billion a year from tobacco exports. And a large
portion of the Dominican Republic's farmland is taken up with
tobacco.
 &HT;    Argentine diehards. But even in a diehard smoking country like
Argentina, where black, Gitane-style tobacco is still popular and
cigarette smoke wafts through the air even at the Ministry of
Public Health, the anti-smoking movement has gradually picked up
steam.
 &HT;    Earlier this year, all Aerolineas Argentinas flights were
declared smoke free.
 &HT;    Legislation has also been recently enacted forbidding the sale
of cigarettes to minors under 18 in the province of Buenos Aires.
The City of Buenos Aires has dedicated $120,000 to an anti-smoking
commission targeted at getting youths to stop smoking and also
passed a by-law forbidding lotteries and games of chance that
promote smoking.
 &HT;    ``The movement is gaining momentum,'' says Leonardo Daino,
director of the anti-tobacco campaign for the Argentine League for
the Fight Against Cancer.
 &HT;    Much of that change has come as a result of the changing legal
environment in the United States. Over the past year, several
lawsuits have been filed in Argentina by citizens _ inspired by
similar U.S. cases _ seeking damages as a result of health problems
related to cigarette smoking. Many offices, particularly those with
U.S. headquarters, are moving toward a no-smoking policy, according
to Daino, who is asked to give motivational talks at many U.S.
multinational companies in Argentina.
 &HT;    Key legislation, however, has been stalled in the Argentine
Congress for months. A proposed law that would make it obligatory
to include the contents of cigarettes on the outside of each pack
has been heavily opposed by cigarette manufacturers, Daino says.
 &HT;    While legislation limiting cigarette advertising to the hours
between 10 p.m. and 8 a.m. already exists, more-far-reaching
regulations are being resisted, particularly by the advertising
industry. The proposed legislation would ban advertising in
publications or at activities targeted at minors. Cigarette
advertisers would also be prohibited from using artistic or sports
personalities popular with minors and would not be permitted to
associate smoking with sports.
 &HT;    In the meantime, cigarette advertising in Argentina remains
high-profile and is largely targeted at young smokers, who
represent one quarter of Argentina's 11 million smokers, or 33
percent of the population. The controversial Joe Camel cartoon ads
that were banned in the United States have been a frequent outdoor
advertisement.
 &HT;    In April, ad agency Verdino Bates launched a new campaign in
which consumers collect four different collector cigarette packs
and then send them in for the chance to win a Harley-Davidson
motorcycle or a Mustang automobile. The winners are announced every
Thursday at midnight during a mini-program featuring a well-known
guest musician.
 &HT;    Camel is manufactured by Nobleza-Piccardo, a subsidiary of
British American Tobacco, which boasts 38 percent of the Argentina
market. The tobacco company's only rival is Massalin Particulares,
a subsidiary of Philip Morris, which claims 62 percent of the 3.2
billion cigarettes sold in Argentina each year. It's Philip
Morris's highest market share in the world, thanks largely to its
Marlboro brand, which alone holds a 37 percent stake in the market.
 &HT;    In 1997, Philip Morris chose Argentina as the first country in
the American hemisphere in which to launch its Chesterfield Brown
cigarette brand, also aimed at younger smokers. Chesterfield Brown
sponsors an alternative radio program, the Chesterfield Music Box,
as well as hitting the Buenos Aires nightclubs with samplings and
giveaways.
 &HT;    But while Philip Morris is clearly targeting the younger end of
the market, it draws the line at cartoons like the Camel Joe
campaign, according to Andres Gomez, senior brands manager for
Massalin Particulares. All models used in Philip Morris ads must be
older than 21. The company avoids promoting cigarettes near high
schools and prohibits the selling of promotional merchandise to
teenagers under 18.
 &HT;    ``No Philip Morris brand would ever be advertised with
cartoons,'' he says. ``We have a strict internal code and we are
fighting so that the industry has a code of self-censorship so that
these things don't happen.''
 &HT;    Brazil smokin'. The anti-smoking brigade has come to Brazil, but
in a much smaller way _ maybe because the industry has such a
dominant effect on its economy.
 &HT;    And it is impressive: Brazil is the leading exporter of raw
tobacco, the fourth-largest producer of raw tobacco and the
sixth-largest producer of cigarettes in the world.
 &HT;    Two companies dominate the tobacco market in Brazil. Souza Cruz
S.A., the subsidiary of British American Tobacco, controls 84
percent of the Brazilian cigarette market with seven of the top 10
brands, including Derby, a discount brand that has cornered 42
percent of the market, followed by Free, Hollywood, Carlton, Plaza,
Belmont and Charm. The three remaining brands _ Dallas, Marlboro
and LM _ are made by Philip Morris, which holds a 14 percent share
of the market.
 &HT;    In 1997, Brazil produced 182.8 billion cigarettes, of which 72
billion were exported, more than seven times the level of 1990.
``Today, our tobacco quality is as good as the Americans and we
sell them at cheaper prices than they do,'' brags Nestor Jost,
president of the Brazilian Tobacco Industry Association, Associacao
Brasileira das Industrias de Fumo (ABIFUMO).
 &HT;    Souza Cruz has three plants in Brazil: Minas Gerais, Sao Paulo
and the Rio Grande do Sul facility, which was completed in December
1996 at a cost of $81 million. It covers 250 acres and is capable
of processing 100,000 tons of tobacco a year, making it the largest
and most modern in the world. Philip Morris, meanwhile, operates
two plants in Brazil, one in Parana and the other in Rio Grande do
Sul.
 &HT;    Despite the export drive, Brazilian consumption is steadily
declining.
 &HT;    After 20 years of steady growth, domestic consumption has
plummeted from 164.1 billion cigarettes in 1990 to 110.8 billion in
1997.
 &HT;    For Jost, the decline is not as dramatic as the figures show.
Although he agrees there are fewer smokers, the figures are
representative of the increase in contraband, which makes up 20
percent to 25 percent of the Brazilian market.
 &HT;    Nevertheless, the consumption decline may also be attributed to
a federal law enacted in 1996 that regulated cigarette
advertisements and banned smoking in public places, except when
separate, well-ventilated smoking sections are provided.
 &HT;    Tobacco manufacturers reacted by running newspaper ads arguing
that both smokers and non smokers have rights and appealed to both
groups to learn to coexist.
 &HT;    But the frontier between smoking and no-smoking areas in Rio de
Janeiro's bars and restaurants is as blurred as the haze of smoke
in the air. ``There seems to be a smoking section and a smoky
section,'' Jaime Cagy, a 53-year-old businessman and non-smoker,
said as he was having a drink at a beach side restaurant in Rio de
Janeiro.
 &HT;    The law also forbids smoking on airline flights of less than one
hour and restricts television advertising of cigarettes between 9
p.m. and 6 a.m.
 &HT;    But legislation against the tobacco industry may become even
more rigorous. A government bill has been sent to Congress
forbidding cigarette advertisements on television before 11 p.m.,
aiming to prevent young people from falling for the industry's
appealing ads. It's expected to be voted on after the October
presidential elections.
 &HT;    The Mexican invasion. Anti-smoking campaigns have hit Mexico,
too. But that hasn't prevented international tobacco giants from
gobbling up Mexican tobacco companies.
 &HT;    Last year, British American Tobacco bought Cigarrera La Moderna
from Monterrey-based conglomerate Pulsar Internacional for $1.7
billion, the largest purchase ever of a Mexican company by a
foreign one. Just before that, Philip Morris upped its stake in
Cigarros La Tabacalera Mexicana (Cigatam) from 29 percent to 49
percent for $400 million. Along with Grupo Carso, Cigatam's
majority owner, Philip Morris also opened a Mexico City office to
handle the marketing for Marlboro and its other brands.
 &HT;    The acquisitions marked the end of an era. For years, La Moderna
and Cigatam were cash cows for their respective owners, helping to
make Pulsar's Alfonso Romo Garza a major corporate player and
powering the rise of Carso Chairman Carlos Slim. Both made Forbes
magazine's list of billionaires this year.
 &HT;    But stagnant demand and the recent economic crisis brought flat
sales and thinning margins, taking the fire out of the $1.4 billion
tobacco market.
 &HT;    The foreign invaders hope to change that with better marketing
and industry know-how. They believe the Mexican market has room to
grow. Mexicans still smoke substantially less than consumers in
rich countries.
 &HT;    ``Penetration in Mexico has not reached the levels it has in the
U.S.,'' says Urban Larson, who tracks Grupo Carso at Santander
Investment in Mexico City. ``Cigarettes are a luxury.''
 &HT;    Rather than snaring first-time smokers with Joe Camel, the
multinational tobacco companies appear to be going after Mexican
females, only 14 percent of whom smoke. Indeed, some of the most
recent ads from several brands show suave, stylish women enjoying a
good cigarette _ much as Virginia Slims did in the United States in
the 1970s.
 &HT;    Cigarette makers are also targeting Mexico's young, upwardly
mobile middle class. Cigatam's Broadway, for example, shows
commercials of hip Mexicans in their 20s and 30s going out to
nightclubs, kissing each other and playing with puppies.
 &HT;    But the cigarette makers also want to retain their 38 percent
hold on Mexican males. Cigatam's macho Marlboro Man is a visible
and popular figure south of the border. Moderna's Boots also uses a
cowboy theme.
 &HT;    So far, their efforts are being felt. Altogether, cigarette
consumption in Mexico has grown during the first five months of the
year.
 &HT;    It helps that Mexico has a looser regulatory structure. Smoking
is currently banned on all airline flights of less than two hours.
But compared with the fierce anti-smoking sentiment in the United
States, Mexicans are relatively tolerant of the burning weed.
 &HT;    Philip Morris's efforts appear to be paying off, at least in
terms of volume. Cigatam sold 9.5 million cigarettes over the first
five months of the year, up 13 percent over the same period last
year. That pushed Cigatam into a virtual tie with La Moderna, whose
sales of 9.6 million cigarettes actually fell 0.3 percent over last
year.
 &HT;    Cigatam's 1997 price cuts and the ongoing economic recovery are
driving the revival. Lower prices have coaxed consumers back to
Marlboro country from cheaper brands and nearly eliminated
counterfeit Marlboros. A pack of Marlboros now goes for an average
of nine pesos, or about $1 _ substantially less than the 12 pesos
it used to cost and not much higher than down-market Cigatam brands
such as Broadway, Faros and Delicados, and La Moderna brands such
as Boots and Montana.
 &HT;    ``Marlboro sales are very responsive to prices, so Cigatam has
made up ground in market share this year,'' says Leonardo Zinser,
an analyst at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell in Mexico City.
 &HT;    If the economic recovery continues, sales volume could continue
to grow and margins in the high teens _ compared with traditional
levels in the high 20s before the crisis _ might get a small boost
as well.
 &HT;    Colombian contraband. Colombia could be the next frontier for
some of the multinational cigarette giants.
 &HT;    The country's tobacco industry is controlled by two companies:
Coltabaco, which trades on the Colombian stock market, and Pro
Tobacco, which is privately held. Both companies have been hammered
by contraband, which makes up between 50 percent and 60 percent of
the market.
 &HT;    ``It's a longstanding problem,'' says Rue Swabey, an analyst at
Santander Investment in Bogota. ``Contraband has kept a roof on
prices, and over the years, it's worn down the tobacco companies.
The industry is really depressed.''
 &HT;    Enter the foreign tobacco companies. Philip Morris considered
acquiring Contabalco in 1995, but never consummated the deal. It's
now said to be in discussions with Pro Tobacco. British American
Tobacco has also expressed interest in entering the Colombian
market.
 &HT;    In the meantime, Coltabaco has combated the problem by
diversifying, buying up chunks of banks, insurance companies and
construction firms. For example, it has a joint venture with
U.S.-based Kimberly Clark, which makes tisue, cigarettes and
writing paper. Its investment portfolio was recently worth around
$300 million.
 &HT;    If the contraband problem and the anti-smoking movement
continues, perhaps other tobacco companies in the region should
consider doing the same.

 Por CLAIRE POOLE, con BRENDAN M. CASE en Mexico D.F., MERY

Aires 
 c.1998 Latin Trade 
 (Distribuido por New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    El anuncio publicitario en la television es seductor. Filmado en
blanco y negro, al estilo de los clasicos, muestra a gente joven
brasilena, mujeres y hombres atractivos con atuendo informal,
disfrutando del ocio, leyendo libros, dando paseos. Entonces viene
el mensaje: ``Es posible que tengamos muchas diferencias, pero
todos tenemos algo en comun: Free.''
 &HT;    ``Free'' no es una linea de ropa, un detergente ni un partido
politico. Es una marca de cigarrillos suaves que fabrica el coloso
brasileno Santa Cruz, controlado por British American Tobacco,
filial de la britanica BAT Industries.
 &HT;    Esos jovenes son la proxima generacion para muchos gigantes
tabacaleros. Mientras el indice de fumadores en ciertos paises
industrializados baja a un ritmo del 1 por ciento anual, la tasa en
los paises en desarrollo aumenta alrededor del 3 por ciento al ano,
segun un articulo publicado en marzo en la revista medica britanica
The Lancet.
 &HT;    En consecuencia, los grandes productores de tabaco buscan en
regiones como America Latina su proxima cantera de consumidores.
``Latinoamerica no es tan importante como Asia o Europa Oriental,''
dice Marc Cohen, analista del sector tabacalero de Goldman Sachs,
en Nueva York. ``Pero esta creciendo.''
 &HT;    British American Tobacco ha sido el mas emprendedor y ha
adquirido participaciones en empresas desde Mexico hasta Chile.
Ahora vende mas de 186.000 millones de cigarrillos al ano en la
region y controla el 50 por ciento del mercado. En Nicaragua,
Honduras, Trinidad y Barbados, controla casi el 100 por ciento del
mercado. America Latina ya representa mas del 25 por ciento de su
total de ventas y casi el 20 por ciento de sus ganancias
operativas.
 &HT;    Esta reciente cruzada de las grandes multinacionales del tabaco
es alarmante para grupos como la Organizacion Panamericana de la
Salud (OPS), con sede en Washington, que trata de mejorar la salud
y el nivel de vida de los habitantes de America.
 &HT;    En un estudio divulgado en abril, la OPS determino que 135.000
personas fallecen todos los anos en Latinoamerica debido al tabaco.
El estudio tambien menciona estadisticas de la Organizacion Mundial
de la Salud, que calcula que la tercera parte de los adultos de
America Latina y el Caribe son fumadores. Eso coloca a la region al
mismo nivel que Canada pero ligeramente por encima de Estados
Unidos. Venezuela, la Republica Dominicana y Bolivia estan a la
cabeza de la lista, mientras Honduras, Costa Rica y Paraguay estan
al final (ver tabla).
 &HT;    Aunque hay mas fumadores latinoamericanos que estadounidenses,
los latinoamericanos fuman menos cigarrillos al dia: 12 frente a
20, segun la OPS. Esa cifra da a los fabricantes de cigarrillos un
gran incentivo para estimular el consumo entre los fumadores
actuales a medida que sus ingresos reales aumentan. Y con la
proporcion de mujeres que fuman en America Latina (el 19 por
ciento) muy por debajo de las fumadoras en Canada y Estados Unidos
(el 26 por ciento), la OPS piensa que las mujeres de la region
probablemente se conviertan en un importante objetivo de las
grandes tabacaleras.
 &HT;    ``Las mujeres se incorporan a la fuerza laboral y por fin se
sienten libres,'' dice Jeannette Noltenius, directora ejecutiva del
Consejo Latino sobre Alcohol y Tabaco en Washington. ``Y con esa
realidad llega la nocion de que fumar forma parte de esa
libertad.''
 &HT;    Para impedir que mas personas adquieran el habito de fumar,
muchos paises de la region han hecho mas estrictas sus
regulaciones. Casi todos los gobiernos latinoamericanos exigen que
en los paquetes de cigarrillos se indiquen los peligros del habito,
con la excepcion de Brasil y Chile, que colocan distintas
advertencias de cuando en cuando. Pero solo dos paises (Chile y
Mexico) exigen que los paquetes ofrezcan informacion sobre los
niveles de alquitran y nicotina.
 &HT;    Entretanto, las regulaciones sobre la publicidad han sido
debiles. Solo tres paises latinoamericanos (Cuba, Nicaragua y
Venezuela) han prohibido la publicidad de los cigarrillos en la
radio y la television, como ocurre en Estados Unidos y Canada. No
obstante, muchos paises han restringido el horario en que se pueden
transmitir anuncios publicitarios, y algunos incluso restringen su
contenido y la audiencia a la que se dirigen.
 &HT;    Ha sido dificil controlar a una industria que es a la vez una
gran fuente de fondos para varios paises latinoamericanos. En la
region hay tres paises que se encuentran entre los principales
productores de tabaco en hoja del mundo: Brasil (cuarto), Argentina
(15to.) y Mexico (16to.). Tres mas estan entre los mayores
exportadores de cigarrillos del mundo: Brasil (sexto), Venezuela
(16to.) y Colombia (20mo.). Brasil recibe casi US$1.000 millones al
ano por las exportaciones de tabaco. Y gran parte de las tierras de
labor de la Republica Dominicana esta dedicada al cultivo del
tabaco.
 &HT;    Argentinos empedernidos. Pero incluso en un pais donde se fuma
mucho, como Argentina, donde el tabaco negro es aun popular y el
humo de los cigarrillos invade los pasillos del Ministerio de Salud
Publica, el movimiento contra el tabaco ha cobrado fuerza poco a
poco.
 &HT;    A principios de este ano se prohibio fumar en todos los vuelos
de Aerolineas Argentinas.
 &HT;    Tambien se promulgo recientemente una ley que prohibe la venta
de cigarrillos a menores de 18 anos en la provincia de Buenos
Aires. La ciudad de Buenos Aires ha destinado US$120.000 a una
comision dedicada a contener el habito de fumar entre la juventud y
tambien aprobo un estatuto que prohibe a las loterias y otros
juegos de azar la promocion del cigarrillo.
 &HT;    ``El movimiento cobra impulso,'' afirma Leonardo Daino, director
de la campana contra el tabaco de la Liga Argentina de Lucha Contra
el Cancer.
 &HT;    Gran parte de esos cambios se deben a Estados Unidos. El ano
pasado, varios ciudadanos presentaron demandas contra empresas
tabacaleras debido a problemas de salud relacionados con el habito
de fumar. Muchas oficinas, sobre todo las de empresas
estadounidenses, prohiben fumar en su interior, segun Daino, que
imparte conferencias contra el tabaco en muchas multinacionales
norteamericanas en Argentina.
 &HT;    Pero la ley decisiva lleva meses estancada en el Congreso
argentino. Daino explica que los fabricantes de cigarrillos se
oponen energicamente a una ley que haria obligatorio exponer el
contenido de los cigarrillos en el exterior de cada paquete.
 &HT;    Aunque ya hay leyes que limitan la publicidad del tabaco a un
horario entre las 10 de la noche y las 8 de la manana, tambien hay
una fuerte oposicion a regulaciones mas estrictas, sobre todo de
parte del sector de la publicidad. La ley propuesta prohibiria los
anuncios o las actividades dirigidas a menores de edad. Tambien se
prohibiria que en la publicidad de cigarrillos se presenten
personalidades del arte y del deporte en compania de menores, y no
se permitiria asociar los deportes con el habito de fumar.
 &HT;    Entretanto, la publicidad de los cigarrillos en Argentina es muy
llamativa y apunta principalmente a los fumadores jovenes, que
representan la cuarta parte de los 11 millones de argentinos que
fuman, el 33 por ciento de la poblacion. Los polemicos anuncios de
Joe Camel, que se prohibieron en Estados Unidos, han aparecido
frecuentemente en exteriores en Argentina.
 &HT;    En abril, la empresa publicitaria Verdino Bates lanzo una nueva
campana en la que los consumidores coleccionan cuatro paquetes de
cigarrillos y los envian al sorteo de una motocicleta Harley
Davidson o un auto Ford Mustang. Los ganadores se anuncian cada
jueves a medianoche en un miniprograma que presenta a un musico muy
popular.
 &HT;    Camel lo fabrica Nobleza-Piccardo, filial de British American
Tobacco, que controla el 38 por ciento del mercado argentino. El
unico rival de la tabacalera es Massalin Particulares, filial de
Philip Morris, que domina el 62 por ciento de los 3.200 millones de
cigarrillos que se venden anualmente en Argentina. Es la mayor
participacion de mercado que tiene Philip Morris en cualquier pais,
debido en especial a su marca Marlboro, que controla el 37 por
ciento del mercado.
 &HT;    En 1997, Philip Morris eligio a Argentina como el primer pais
del hemisferio americano para lanzar su marca de cigarrillos
Chesterfield Brown, dirigida tambien a los fumadores jovenes.
Chesterfield Brown patrocina un programa de radio alternativa,
Chesterfield Music Box, y tambien invade los clubes nocturnos de
Buenos Aires con muestras y regalos.
 &HT;    Pero aunque Philip Morris apunta visiblemente al sector mas
joven del mercado, no utiliza historietas graficas como en la
campana de Joe Camel, afirma Andres Gomez, gerente de marcas de
Massalin Particulares. Todos los modelos utilizados en los anuncios
de Philip Morris tienen que ser mayores de 21 anos. La compania
evita la promocion de cigarros cerca de las escuelas secundarias y
prohibe la venta de articulos promocionales a menores de 18 anos.
 &HT;    ``Ninguna marca de Philip Morris se anunciara jamas con
historietas graficas,'' dice. ``Tenemos un codigo interno estricto
y nos esforzamos por que la industria tenga un codigo propio de
censura para que cosas asi no pasen.''
 &HT;    Humo en Brasil. La brigada antitabaco ha llegado a Brasil, pero
a un paso mucho mas lento, quiza porque el sector tiene una
influencia vigorosa en la economia.
 &HT;    Y esa influencia es impresionante: Brasil es el principal
exportador de tabaco en hoja, el cuarto productor de tabaco en hoja
y el sexto productor de cigarrillos del mundo.
 &HT;    Dos empresas dominan el mercado tabacalero en Brasil: Souza Cruz
S.A., filial de British American Tobacco, controla el 84 por ciento
del mercado brasileno con siete de las 10 marcas principales:
Derby, una marca de precios de descuento que domina el 42 por
ciento del mercado; Free, Hollywood, Carlton, Plaza, Belmont y
Charm. Las tres marcas restantes (Dallas, Marlboro y LM) las
fabrica Philip Morris, que tiene una participacion de mercado del
14 por ciento.
 &HT;    En 1997, Brasil produjo 182.800 millones de cigarrillos, de los
cuales se exportaron 72.000 millones, mas de siete veces el nivel
de 1990. ``Hoy la calidad de nuestro tabaco es tan buena como la de
los norteamericanos y lo vendemos a precios mas bajos,'' se jacta
Nestor Jost, presidente de la Asociacion Brasilena de la Industria
del Tabaco, ABIFUMO.
 &HT;    Souza Cruz tiene tres fabricas en Brasil: Minas Gerais, Sao
Paulo y Rio Grande do Sul, que se termino en diciembre de 1996 a un
costo de US$81 millones. Tiene una extension de 101 hectareas y una
capacidad de procesamiento de 100.000 toneladas de tabaco al ano,
lo que la convierte en la planta mayor y mas moderna del mundo.
Entretanto, Philip Morris tiene dos plantas en Brasil, una en
Parana y la otra en Rio Grande do Sul.
 &HT;    A pesar del impulso exportador, el consumo en Brasil disminuye
cada vez mas.
 &HT;    Despues de 20 anos de crecimiento constante, el consumo nacional
ha bajado de 164.100 millones de cigarrillos en 1990 a 110.800
millones en 1997.
 &HT;    Jost opina que la declinacion no es tan marcada como indican las
cifras. Aunque reconoce que hay menos fumadores, los numeros
reflejan mas bien un incremento del contrabando, que constituye
entre el 20 por ciento y el 25 por ciento del mercado brasileno.
 &HT;    Pero la reduccion del consumo tambien puede atribuirse a una ley
federal promulgada en 1996 que regulo la publicidad del cigarro y
prohibio fumar en lugares publicos, excepto en secciones aisladas y
bien ventiladas dispuestas al efecto.
 &HT;    Los tabacaleros reaccionaron publicando anuncios en la prensa en
los que alegaban que tanto los que fuman como los que no fuman
tienen derechos y pedian a ambos grupos que aprendieran a
coexistir.
 &HT;    Pero la frontera entre las areas donde se puede fumar y donde no
se puede fumar en los bares y restaurantes de Rio de Janeiro es tan
difusa como el humo de los cigarrillos en el aire. ``Parece haber
una seccion para fumar y una seccion de humo,'' dice Jaime Cagy,
empresario de 53 anos, que no fuma, mientras bebia un trago en un
restaurante carioca de la playa.
 &HT;    La ley tambien prohibe fumar en vuelos de menos de una hora, y
restringe la publicidad de los cigarrillos en television al horario
de 9 p.m. a 6 a.m.
 &HT;    Pero las medidas contra la industria tabacalera podrian ser mas
rigurosas. El gobierno ha enviado un proyecto de ley al Congreso
que prohibiria los anuncios de cigarrillos en la television antes
de las 11 p.m. Se espera que el Congreso decida despues de las
elecciones presidenciales de octubre.
 &HT;    La invasion mexicana. Las campanas contra el tabaco tambien han
llegado a Mexico. Pero eso no ha impedido a los gigantes
internacionales absorber a las tabacaleras mexicanas.
 &HT;    El ano pasado, British American Tobacco compro Cigarrera La
Moderna al conglomerado Pulsar Internacional, con sede en
Monterrey, por US$1.700 millones, la mayor compra en la historia de
una empresa mexicana por una empresa extranjera. Poco antes de esa
adquisicion, Philip Morris elevo su participacion en Cigarros La
Tabacalera Mexicana (Cigatam) del 29 por ciento al 49 por ciento
por US$400 millones. Junto con el Grupo Carso, el dueno mayoritario
de Cigatam, Philip Morris tambien abrio una oficina en la capital
mexicana a cargo del mercadeo de Marlboro y sus demas marcas.
 &HT;    Durante muchos anos, La Moderna y Cigatam fueron minas de oro,
catapultaron a Carlos Slim, el presidente del Grupo Carso, y
contribuyeron a convertir a Alfonso Romo Garza, de Pulsar, en un
peso pesado del mundo empresarial. Ambos entraron en la lista de
multimillonarios de la revista Forbes este ano.
 &HT;    Pero el debilitamiento de la demanda y la reciente crisis
economica causaron un estancamiento de las ventas y una reduccion
de los margenes de ganancia que apagaron el mercado tabacalero, que
mueve US$1.400 millones.
 &HT;    Los invasores extranjeros esperan cambiar esa situacion con un
mejor mercadeo y un fuerte conocimiento del sector. Opinan que el
mercado mexicano tiene espacio para crecer. En Mexico se fuma
muchisimo menos que en los paises ricos.
 &HT;    ``La penetracion en Mexico no ha llegado al nivel de Estados
Unidos,'' dice Urban Larson, analista de Santander Investment en
Mexico DF que estudia al Grupo Carso. ``Los cigarrillos son un
lujo.''
 &HT;    En vez de tentar a los que fuman por primera vez con Joe Camel,
las multinacionales al parecer tienen en la mira a las mexicanas,
de las que solo el 14 por ciento fuma. De hecho, varios anuncios
recientes de diversas marcas presentan a mujeres elegantes
disfrutando de un buen cigarrillo, como hizo Virginia Slims en
Estados Unidos en los anos 70. Los fabricantes tambien apuntan a la
joven clase media mexicana, cada vez mas prospera. Broadway, de
Cigatam, presenta anuncios de mexicanos de entre 20 y 35 anos que
van a clubes nocturnos, se besan y juegan con cachorros.
 &HT;    Pero los fabricantes de cigarros tambien quieren mantener su
control sobre el 38 por ciento de los hombres mexicanos. La imagen
masculina del Hombre de Marlboro, de Cigatam, es una figura visible
y popular. Boots, de Moderna, tambien emplea el tema de los
vaqueros.
 &HT;    Y los esfuerzos se hacen sentir. En total, el consumo de
cigarrillos aumento el 6,1 por ciento en Mexico en los primeros
cinco meses del ano. Un factor que contribuye a ese aumento es la
debil estructura normativa de Mexico. Esta prohibido fumar en todos
los vuelos de aerolineas de menos de dos horas. Pero en comparacion
con el feroz rechazo al tabaco en Estados Unidos, los mexicanos son
relativamente tolerantes hacia el humo.
 &HT;    El empeno de Philip Morris parece dar dividendos, por lo menos
en cuanto al volumen. Cigatam vendio 9,5 millones de cigarrillos en
los primeros cinco meses del ano, 13 por ciento mas que en el mismo
periodo del ano pasado. Ese aumento empato practicamente a Cigatam
con La Moderna, cuyas ventas de 9,6 millones de cigarrillos
representaron un descenso del 0,3 por ciento con respecto al ano
pasado.
 &HT;    Las reducciones de Cigatam en los precios en 1997 y la
recuperacion economica impulsan la revitalizacion. Los precios mas
bajos han atraido a los consumidores de vuelta a Marlboro,
abandonando marcas mas baratas, y casi eliminaron los Marlboro
falsos. Una cajetilla de Marlboro ahora cuesta un promedio de nueve
pesos, alrededor de US$1, menos de los 12 pesos que costaba y no
mucho mas cara que marcas de Cigatam dirigidas al segmento inferior
del mercado, como Broadway, Faros y Delicados, y marcas de La
Moderna como Boots y Montana.
 &HT;    ``Las ventas de Marlboro dependen mucho de los precios, de modo
que Cigatam recupero terreno en participacion de mercado este
ano,'' comenta Leonardo Zinser, analista de Deutsche Morgan
Grenfell en Mexico.
 &HT;    Si la recuperacion economica continua, el volumen de ventas
seguira creciendo y los margenes de casi el 20 por ciento (frente a
los niveles tradicionales de casi el 30 por ciento antes de la
crisis) tambien podrian aumentar.
 &HT;    Contrabando colombiano. Colombia podria ser la proxima frontera
de algunas multinacionales del cigarrillo. El sector tabacalero del
pais esta controlado por dos empresas: Coltabaco y Pro Tobacco.
Ambas companias han sufrido el embate del contrabando, que tiene
entre el 50 por ciento y el 60 por ciento del mercado.
 &HT;    ``Es un viejo problema,'' dice Rue Swabey, analista de Santander
Investment en Bogota. ``El contrabando le ha puesto un techo a los
precios y ha devastado a las tabacaleras.''
 &HT;    Pero llegan las tabacaleras foraneas. Philip Morris considero la
adquisicion de Coltabaco en 1995 pero nunca cerro el trato. Se dice
que ahora negocia con Pro Tobacco. British American Tobacco tambien
ha mostrado interes en el mercado colombiano.
 &HT;    Entretanto, Coltabaco ha combatido el problema diversificandose,
comprando participaciones en bancos, companias de seguros y
empresas de construccion. Por ejemplo, tiene una empresa conjunta
con Kimberly Clark, de EU, que produce papel tisu, para cigarrillos
y de escribir. Su cartera de inversiones se calculo recientemente
en unos US$300 millones.
 &HT;    Si el problema del contrabando y el movimiento antitabaco
continua, quiza otras tabacaleras de la region consideren pasos
similares.

   RUSSIA-PROTEST _ MOSCOW _ Long-suffering Russians took to the
streets Wednesday amid the country's economic crisis in nationwide
protests full of anguish, but not anger. Thousands called for the
resignation of President Boris Yeltsin in the restrained and
peaceful marches. But their numbers did not match the expectations
of Communist Party and labor union leaders, who had predicted that
tens of millions would rally. The reason is plain, said a TV news
director in Vladivostok: No one believes in Yeltsin, but few
Russians believe in the opposition either. ``People understand the
uselessness of these actions. The union leaders and Communists are
left over from the Soviet period. That's why they couldn't get
their people out. People don't believe in such demonstrations.''

church and school. Here, in a country of 260,000, there are more

   VOTERS _ In 1992 Ohio voters wanted change and they went to the
polls in the greatest numbers of the last 20 years. In that year
Ohio was a key state in Bill Clinton's winning the presidency. But
since then voter participation has dwindled, especially in
non-presidential election years. With Clinton mired in scandal,
some experts fear that the number of people who choose to vote this
year will be the lowest ever. That spells trouble for the
Democratic Party and perhaps for our form of government as well.
``What we are witnessing is a progressive meltdown in civic
engagement, a major danger to American democracy,'' said Curtis

Y2K GURU IS UPBEAT ON BEATING THE BUG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The latest word from Y2K guru Ed Yardeni is as optimistic as he
has ever been when discussing Uncle Sam's progress in dealing with
the computer age's looming year 2000 bug. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yardeni, chief economist at Deutsche Bank Research, probably
spends more time exploring the Y2K phenomenon than anyone around
Wall Street. As a leading expert on the subject, Yardeni says the
likelihood of recession in 2000 is relatively high because of
coming computer glitches. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The problem is the double zero, which computer systems may read
as 1900 rather than 2000 because only two digits have been used for
years in most systems to conserve memory. If these programs aren't
fixed to ensure the proper reading of the date when 2000 arrives,
huge systemic breakdowns are feared. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yardeni's Y2K Reporter of Sept. 21, however, is upbeat on the
subject nearest and dearest to recipients of federal transfer
payments. The question they've been increasingly concerned about is
whether the Y2K problem will disrupt delivery of the money they
receive from Washington. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yardeni's advisory, titled ``Will Uncle Sam Compute in 2000?''
says the most recent assessment of the federal Financial Management
Service reflects increasing optimism. A recent edition of Federal
Computer Week reports that the Financial Management Service, the
Treasury Department's main check-writing agency, has brought on
line two Y2K-compliant systems for processing Social Security
retirement and disability checks. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   These account for about 70 percent of the 850 million payments
the agency makes annually. The agency also pays veterans' benefits,
does tax refunds, and processes some federal salary and vendor
payments. With just under 15 months to go until 2000, this move
seems to give the payment agency reasonable time to smooth out its
computer operation. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of the first known federal Y2K glitches occurred at the
Social Security Administration in 1989 when a field office tried to
rejigger a repayment schedule out to the year 2000. The system
wouldn't handle dates after 2000, though, which brought the
realization that the year 2000 would pose a daunting
data-processing challenge. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While those receiving federal benefits can take heart from the
progress at Social Security and the Financial Management Service,
Yardeni's evaluation of other government operations is a mixed bag.
Other well-prepared agencies include the Small Business
Administration, Commerce Department, General Services
Administration and Environmental Protection Agency. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The worst laggards, according to a House subcommittee monitoring
the situation, include the departments of State, Energy, Justice,
Education, and Health and Human Services. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Despite the poor marks received by some important departments,
Yardeni says the U.S. government is nevertheless in reasonably good
shape. He goes so far as to reassure clients that the ``worst
case'' scenario when 2000 arrives is much less likely than last
year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of Yardeni's more interesting views, which came as a
somewhat downbeat aside near the end of the report, concerned the
air transportation situation. He says that while the Federal
Aviation Administration will ``keep the jets flying in January
2000,'' he doubts that full schedules will be possible initially.
Domestic traffic, he estimates, will be 75 percent of normal for a
few weeks while international flights might suffer a temporary 30
percent reduction. &QL;

AIDS CONSORTIUM TO RECRUIT VOLUNTEERS FOR TESTING OF AIDS VACCINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALAN BAVLEY  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Kansas City AIDS Research Consortium was bracing for phone
calls Wednesday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At 8 a.m., the consortium was to begin accepting applications
from area residents for the first large-scale test of a vaccine
against AIDS. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City is among the first 10 cities to participate in a
nationwide study of AIDSVAX, the only AIDS vaccine to reach the
final stage of testing, the consortium announced Tuesday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   About 150 volunteers will be recruited locally for the three- to
four-year study. About 5,000 people in several dozen cities in the
United States and 2,500 people in Thailand will participate. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If the test shows AIDSVAX prevents AIDS infection, its
manufacturer, VaxGen of Brisbane, Calif., will ask the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration to approve its general use. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We're expecting numerous, numerous phone calls over the next
few weeks,'' said Jan Meier, the consortium's clinical director and
supervisor of the vaccine study. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The consortium seeks men and women for the study who are at high
risk of contracting AIDS but currently free from HIV, the AIDS
virus, Meier said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, that includes men who have sex with men and women
who have had a sexually transmitted disease and more than one male
sex partner in the last year. Intravenous drug users are
ineligible. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Subjects will receive seven injections _ three shots of the
vaccine and four booster shots _ in a 30-month period. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To make a valid comparison between vaccinated and unvaccinated
people, two-thirds of the subjects will get the actual vaccine,
while one-third will receive a placebo, an inactive substance that
looks the same as the vaccine. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All subjects will undergo periodic blood tests and receive
frequent counseling on safe-sex AIDS prevention. Studies have
shown, however, that people at high risk of AIDS generally do not
follow safe-sex advice. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Researchers will not know whether the vaccine works unless some
of the participants engage in sex with HIV-infected partners, but
test subjects will be urged not to assume that the vaccine will
protect them. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Although we suspect AIDSVAX will work, we don't know for a
certainty,'' said David McKinsey, the principal physician involved
in the Kansas City study. ``Even in the best-case scenario, the
vaccine is not going to be 100 percent effective.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If after three years results show the vaccine is highly
effective, the study will be stopped and all participants on
placebos will get the vaccine. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The consortium will begin distributing fliers announcing the
trial to coffeehouses, bars and stores. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We're basically going to blanket as much of the community as
we can,'' said Patti Abshier, the consortium's outreach
coordinator. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AIDSVAX testing began June 23 in Philadelphia. Since then, test
sites have opened in Los Angeles, St. Louis, Chicago, Washington
and several other cities. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To bring the vaccine trial to Kansas City, the consortium and
community leaders. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt like because we're not one of the largest populations
in the country we really had to show our interest,'' said Gary
Johnson, executive director of the consortium. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AIDS vaccine research has suffered recent setbacks. Scientists
who tested a vaccine made from weakened but live HIV on monkeys
found it eventually caused illness and offered limited protection
from infection. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The AIDSVAX vaccine does not use HIV itself. Instead, it
contains a protein the virus uses as a biological ``key'' to enter
and destroy human cells. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By priming the body's immune system to recognize this protein,
scientists hope that people exposed to HIV will be able to mount a
successful fight against the virus. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The scientific community has met AIDSVAX with skepticism because
the National Institutes of Health decided in 1994 that a vaccine
based on the protein was too weak to study. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VaxGen says it has improved the vaccine so that it is effective
against the two HIV strains most common in the United States. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a test on chimpanzees, AIDSVAX was effective in preventing
infection. And in small trials on people in the United States and
Thailand, more than 90 percent of subjects who received the vaccine
developed antibodies, an indication the vaccine may protect against
HIV. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like being on the leading edge,'' said Nzeera
Virani-Ketter, senior director of medical affairs at VaxGen. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There are groups of people who think it will never work. There
are groups of people who are sure it will work. And there are
people who think a good study is needed. I'm in that middle
group.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Roger Gooden, a Kansas City resident and chairman of the
National Association of People With AIDS, said he was thrilled the
vaccine would be available locally. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He cautioned, however, that even if the vaccine worked, more
research must be done. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't take away our commitment to end the epidemic,''
Gooden said. ``We won't rest quietly until we have a cure.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Persons interested in participating in the AIDSVAX study may
call the AIDS Research Consortium at 931-5477. &QL;

LONG BELIEVED A FAKE, MUMMIFIED KITTEN IS PROVEN TO BE REAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNN FRANEY  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, Mo. _ For decades, scientists thought a 2,000-year-old
mummified kitten from Egypt was a fake. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But on a computer screen Tuesday at the University of
Missouri-Columbia, the truth was clear: There really was a cat
inside the wrappings. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh! It's real! Cool!'' exclaimed Patricia Podzorski, an
Egyptology scholar at MU. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A CT-scanner's computer image, just a few millimeters thick,
showed the inside of the mummified kitten. The black space
representing the inside of a skull and the bright white images of
bones showed that this was a real kitten that had been wrapped in
linen and probably offered to an Egyptian god. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought there might have been a mistake,'' said Jane Biers,
curator of ancient art at the MU Museum of Art and Archaeology,
where the kitten and two other animal mummies _ a baby crocodile
and a hawk _ are on display. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``That's great!'' exclaimed Luann Andrews, the museum's curator
of education, as she witnessed the scientific discovery in an
imaging room in the Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It had been her idea to follow the lead of other schools and put
the animals through the CT-scanner so they could be explored
without disturbing their ancient wrappings. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The three mummified animals are on loan to MU from the Field
Museum of Chicago. Andrews has planned three programs for children
on Halloween to explore the animal mummies and the computer
images. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an effort to help kids understand that science and
technology can help us,'' Andrews said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   How science can help was evident Tuesday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Podzorski and Biers were shocked to learn the truth about an
object they had always accepted as a fake, and that researchers
thought had been sold to an unsuspecting Egyptian who wanted to
please the gods thousands of years ago. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Field Museum and MU have displayed the kitten in earlier
exhibits, but with the understanding that there wasn't a kitten
inside. With the scanning images recorded Tuesday, researchers can
try to determine the cat's age, its physical condition, how it died
and whether anything was wrapped with it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The same evaluations will be done on the baby crocodile, which
is less than a foot and a half long, and the baby hawk, whose beak
and one talon partly peek out of the wrapping. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Lattimer, associate professor of veterinary medicine and
surgery, expected to spend several weeks analyzing hundreds of
computer images of the three animals. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Already, he said, the project has proven its value: The
discovery of the real kitten ``makes the whole project
worthwhile.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Researchers analyze mummies to find out more about ancient
Egyptian culture and religion. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Egyptians mummified animals for different reasons for more than
1,000 years before the birth of Christ, Podzorski said. Pets often
were mummified and buried with their owners. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Other animals that represented certain gods were mummified and
offered as votive gifts to the gods at temples. For example, cats
were associated with the goddess Bastet, a good protectress, or the
lioness-goddess Sekhmet, a ferocious goddess of war, plague and
pestilence. Cat cemeteries have been found throughout Egypt. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The kitten studied Tuesday probably was wrapped in linen between
664 and 30 B.C. The baby crocodile probably dates to between 323
B.C. and 200 A.D. and was dedicated to the god Sobek, who took the
form of a crocodile. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Major crocodile cults existed along the Nile River. The
crocodile's linen wrappings are in several shades of brown and tan,
woven in a geometric pattern that resembles a shortbread cookie. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The mummified hawk probably was dedicated to one of several gods
associated with falcons, such as the sky god Horus, the war god
Montu and the sun god Re. In Memphis, Egypt, nearly a half-million
falcon mummies, identified with Horus, were found in huge burial
galleries. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now, the MU researchers hope to try to determine the three
animals' ages and sexes. They also will try to determine whether
the animals died naturally or were killed before being wrapped, and
whether their internal organs were removed or left inside. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope when we start slicing and dicing in different
directions, (these characteristics) will become more obvious,''
Lattimer said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Bobbie Dreis-Ayers needed a high-end piece of computer equipment
to start her business. The company that built the equipment would
deal only with established businesses. It was a classic Catch-22. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Dreis-Ayers found a solution that was part ``Saturday Night
Live,'' part Rube Goldberg. She went to her brother's business and
recorded office sounds _ a phone ringing here, a person typing at a
computer keyboard there. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Then she went back to her home and called the computer company,
playing the recorded office noise in the background. She got the
equipment. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That was $5 million and eight years ago. The glorified closet
that once was the headquarters of Visual Applications Inc. is now
just one of a suite of offices that houses the growing software
company in North Kansas City. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A couple of recent developments could make that growth spurt
look almost puny. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Visual Applications recently cut a deal with a major partner
that could expand the company's software sales exponentially. The
agreement with Macmillan Digital Publishing USA could more than
quadruple the number of retailers who carry the company's Imagine
home improvement software. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That would be big news for any small software company, but the
agreement with Macmillan almost takes a back seat to something else
the company is doing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Visual Applications is taking on the Internet, and company
officials think they have software that's a step ahead of anything
else on the ever-developing on-line network _ something they think
might even change the way people use the Net. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The software, called cMyVision, will be available free on the
Internet early next year. It uses new technology and allows
computer users to easily move images from Internet Web sites into
any digital photograph or drawing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Furniture can be moved into a photograph of a living room.
Consumers using a photograph of themselves could try on clothing
without going to the mall. Homebuyers could see if their
landscaping vision for that new home would really work. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Users of the Web-based software will be able to experimentally
make changes without altering anything. The new technology allows
the Internet to become a virtual database of design ideas,
Dreis-Ayers said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the only way to move images from the Internet into a
photograph is save the image onto a computer's hard drive and then
use relatively complex software to merge the two images. For
routine work, it isn't practical. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Visual Applications software allows users to click on an
image at an Internet site and drag that image into the company's
software. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Kansas City is the last place someone would expect for
somebody to come out with technology that will lead the industry,
but we did it,'' Dreis-Ayers said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An elevator ride sold Barry Friedman on Visual Applications. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Friedman, a top software agent who says he's on a first-name
basis with Bill Gates and whose company represents other businesses
that sell $100 million worth of software a year, met Dreis-Ayers at
a software publishing convention in California. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard them talking about what they had on the elevator, and
I started talking to them,'' Friedman said. ``I doubted that they
had what they said, but as soon as I saw it, I immediately asked to
represent them. I usually turn down 99 of the 100 software
publishers who come to me.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Friedman brought in others to look at the cMyVision software,
setting up an advisory board for Visual Applications that includes
top software and business executives from across the country. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an obvious technological advancement they've made
that's applicable to other fields of business,'' said Friedman,
president of the International Computer Group. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Visual Applications Web site, where the software will be
tested, initially will feature only home remodeling and decorating
products. The company is planning to expand quickly with apparel
and other products. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Visual Applications officials are unveiling the software in
private showings this week at Internet World, one of the industry's
top trade shows. The show starts today in New York. Next month, the
company will have a booth in Las Vegas at Comdex, the world's
leading computer trade show. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the cMyVision product is likely to be little more
than a fun software toy on the Internet. Users will be able to
alter pictures of their homes and friends, save the photos, print
them out and even send them by e-mail. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That alone could make cMyVision a valuable product to retailers
and manufacturers because it will keep people on Web sites longer
as they look for images to use in their photographs, Dreis-Ayers
said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Visual Applications officials think cMyVision has other,
more significant potential. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``What this does is take a seller's product into a potential
customer's home and allows them to view them and try them,'' said
Charles Macan, executive vice president of Visual Applications.
``It increases the likelihood of a sale. They can buy it on line,
or print the picture off and say, `I want this.' '' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Macan said the process could revolutionize commerce on the
Internet. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Home centers, paint and wallpaper manufacturers, clothing makers
and other businesses could open up a whole new kind of Web-based
advertising, Dreis-Ayers said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although Visual Applications will be allowing consumers to
download the software free, there are plenty of opportunities for
the company to make money, Dreis-Ayers said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The company charges retailers or manufacturers a small fee to
``enable'' their products to be easily incorporated into the
cMyVision software. The potential for electronic commerce could
bring in more revenue. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although cMyVision is essentially a free, on-line version of the
company's basic in-the-box software product, Visual Applications
officials think sales of their core product won't be affected. In
fact, they think the opposite will happen. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The company's deal with Macmillan will put the software in
large, traditional retailers, not just computer stores and software
sellers. Sales, which grew by 75 percent this year, are projected
to grow by 250 percent next year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've sold in retail in four years, they're going to sell
in two months,'' Dreis-Ayers said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Friedman said the Macmillan agreement was important because
Visual Applications' two largest competitors _ Sierra On-line and
Broderbund Software _ are billion-dollar companies. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very hard to have Visual Applications compete against a
billion-dollar company,'' Friedman said. ``So the answer was to
partner with a billion-dollar company.'' &QL;

   ON THE SWEET SIDE: A reader writes looking for a recipe for
chocolate gravy. Our most recent Virginia import, reporter Larry
Bingham, says he grew up eating his granny's chocolate gravy _
actually, it was canned Hershey's syrup. (Sometime I'll tell you
about my friend who didn't realize until she went to college that
spaghetti sauce is not ketchup.) At any rate, this is a staple of
some regions of the South, and here's the recipe from ``Smokehouse
Ham, Spoon Bread and Scuppernong Wine: The Folklore and Art of
Southern Appalachian Cooking'' by Joseph E. Dabney (Cumberland
House, $27.95).
</P>
<P>
   KENTUCKY CHOCOLATE GRAVY

   Ah, the joys of youth. What baby boomer can't remember the drive
with a date to the local Big Boy, A &AMP; W or Dairy Queen, where a
young woman cheerfully took orders from people in parked cars, then
delivered shakes and cheeseburgers she might have even helped to
prepare?
</P>
<P>
   Forget it. In the fast-food industry today, there's no room for
individual expression, carefree service or pitching in to help when
the going gets tough. The next time you chow down on one of the
1,024 permutations of a Burger King Whopper (the customer can make
up to 10 choices per burger, like whether to have cheese or
pickles), you might like to reflect on the fact that burger
production has become an exact science in which everything is
regimented, every distance calculated and every dollop of ketchup
monitored and tracked.
</P>
<P>
   Each of our company-owned restaurants is a sophisticated
network, said Patrick Forney, who oversees the sales-tracking
systems at the Burger King Corp.'s headquarters in Miami. Special
software is used to monitor every aspect of the ordering and
serving process in real time.
</P>
<P>
   That information is garnered from every counter sales terminal
and then sent via a local network to a Windows NT server in the
restaurant manager's office.
</P>
<P>
   Every major fast-food chain, including McDonald's, Hardee's,
Kentucky Fried Chicken, Taco Bell and Wendy's, uses a version of
the same software package in at least some of their stores,
according to the company that makes the software, Compris
Technologies. (Citing competitive pressure, McDonald's officials
declined to be interviewed for this article.)
</P>
<P>
   Burger King's process begins the moment you're ready to buy. The
counter person takes your order and types it into the terminal,
including such special requests as extra pickles, no mustard or
three slices of tomato. Each item that makes up that order is then
automatically deleted from inventory.
</P>
<P>
   A list of the items ordered is sent to the appropriate
preparation station. Burger orders appear on a video screen near
the grill, while the expedite person gets a printout showing the
number of fries, desserts and shakes.
</P>
<P>
   The order taker does not need to know the price of an item
because it automatically appears when the button for that item is
touched.
</P>
<P>
   If the chain is running a special, like half-price children's
meals, then Burger King headquarters sends a command directly to
the computers at every one of its company-owned stores to alter the
menu for the period the special is being offered. Each terminal
automatically reverts to the old price when the special offer
expires.
</P>
<P>
   To accomplish all that, the manager of each Burger King uses an
off-the-shelf Windows NT server to transmit and receive data to and
from the terminals at the sales counter and to store data. It runs
a modified version of the restaurant software, called Composer, to
track food consumption, the time needed to fill an order, the time
needed to give change, how long it takes for an order to be entered
and standard bookkeeping data on employees, like payroll and
overtime information.
</P>
<P>
   With Composer, you can figure out how much of an item is going
to be ordered during every upcoming 15-minute period, even
distinguishing between days of the week, by averaging sales over
the past nine weeks, said Paul Eurek, president of Compris, in
Kennesaw, Ga. The company supplies inventory, sales and labor
tracking software to more than half of the restaurants in the
nation's top 100 chains.
</P>
<P>
   The software monitors the use of condiments like ketchup down to
units of 0.12 ounces and calculates when it's time to order more
food. For example, the number of tomatoes used in a day is
calculated by dividing the number of slices served by the typical
number of slices per tomato; the total number of tomato slices
served is automatically kept up to date each time an item is
entered into a computer at the counter.
</P>
<P>
   By matching the amount of food ordered with the amount of money
taken in, and accounting for spoilage, managers can quickly
determine if any food or money is missing.
</P>
<P>
   Combinations, condiments can be ordered in many different ways _
extra mustard, extra mayo, no pickles _ and the system tracks each
one.
</P>
<P>
   With Composer, usage patterns can be tracked for as long as the
software has been in place. If a store manager notices that sales
of fries jump up 20 percent on every Super Bowl Sunday, the manager
can stock extra potatoes before the next game.
</P>
<P>
   If sales always increase during a national promotion, the
manager can instruct the program to increase the predicted food
usage by a certain percentage for each day during the promotion.
Sales, usage and inventory data can be viewed as graphs or pie
charts, and the information can be exported to standard
spreadsheets like Microsoft's Excel for further massaging.
</P>
<P>
   Each evening, that day's sales data are uploaded from the
store's server to the company's headquarters. The main office can
also tap into a local company-owned store's computer at any time to
see what's going on. Headquarters can even take over a counter
terminal if something's going wrong.
</P>
<P>
   All that helps fiercely competitive fast-food franchises make
sure that food costs, as well as the food itself, are cut to the
bone.

HOW TO BUY THE FRESHEST SEAFOOD, COURTESY OF COOKBOOK AUTHOR JAMES
PETERSON
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanied by SEAFOOD-RECIPES) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BEVERLY BUNDY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ James Peterson came to town recently to
market his new cookbook, ``Vegetables'' (William Morrow, $35). But
this is Texas, and we know our vegetables _ well, the white one
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   So we decided to avail ourselves of some of Peterson's other
knowledge. In 1996, Peterson won an International Association of
Culinary Professionals cookbook award for his ``Fish &AMP; Shellfish''
(William Morrow, $40). So, to get his tips on buying fish, we took
him to a local fish counter.
</P>
<P>
   For a New York boy, he was pretty impressed. In this day and
age, it's not necessary to live by an ocean or river to get good
seafood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Salmon is very cheap now because so much of it is farmed,''
Peterson says. ``In a lot of ways, the farm-raised salmon is better
than wild salmon. It's fattier, for one thing, and so has more
flavor. And because it's farmed, it's fresh, because there is a
system in place of getting it from the water to the consumer. It's
packed in ice immediately and moved out.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he lives near the Fulton Fish Market, the Valhalla of
fish wholesalers, he finds the fish there not always as
well-handled as it could be, and so is hardly disapproving of the
farm-to-market approach.
</P>
<P>
   The Paris-trained chef and teacher says the French are blessed
with their bounty from the sea. Because they have the Mediterranean
Sea and the English Channel, they can reap both cold-water and
warm-water offerings. But we have offerings that Peterson says we
ignore.
</P>
<P>
   What we've done, Peterson says, is turn what was naturally a
cheap food source into an expensive luxury. By concentrating on
tuna, swordfish, salmon, red snapper and halibut, Americans have
bypassed fish like mullet, which can be just as satisfying. As a
New Yorker, he must go to ethnic markets to find even catfish.
</P>
<P>
   The Italians, the Spanish, the English, the French all have
histories as big fish eaters. But after a few generations of being
in America, their diets are assimilated into the national table of
beef, pork and chicken. That's why Peterson recommends shopping in
ethnic markets for seafood.
</P>
<P>
   But not all change is bad. Peterson is glad to see one fish fad
fade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Orange roughy; thank God that's gone,'' he says. ``Someone did
a great sales job on that fish. It's caught and frozen, then
brought in and thawed and filleted and then frozen again to send to
stores, where it gets thawed out again.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are James Peterson's tips for buying seafood:
</P>
<P>
   1. Buy whole fish if you can. It's easier to judge quality.
</P>
<P>
   2. The old rule of checking for clarity of the eyes doesn't
always wash. Some fish simply have cloudy eyes. Instead, look for
eyes that protrude, as if the fish is animated.
</P>
<P>
   3. Look under the gills. They should be bright cherry red.
</P>
<P>
   4. Smell the gills. They should smell like the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   5. The tail should not be dried out.
</P>
<P>
   6. When buying lobster, ask how long they've been in the tank.
Once they're in a tank at the supermarket, they're not fed, so it's
as if they're on a diet, and the meat begins to melt away.
</P>
<P>
   7. Whole fish should have a sheen. If the skin is leathery or
has wrinkles, the fish has lost enough moisture to be past its
prime.
</P>
<P>
   8. Some whole fish have color striations when they are extremely
fresh. Mahi-mahi, for instance, has yellow and blue in its skin
when it is right out of the water. Not having the color doesn't
mean the fish is too old; it's just not right out of the water.
Mackerel, too, can be quite beautiful, with blue and green
markings.
</P>
<P>
   9. Fillets are harder to judge, but one place to look is along
the bone line. The color there should be red, not brown.
</P>
<P>
   10. When buying tuna, the flesh should look almost beefy and
full. When tuna is marked as ``sashimi quality'' _ meaning it can
be eaten raw _ it's an indication of freshness.
</P>
<P>
   11. When buying shrimp, ask to smell them. They should smell
like nothing _ and particularly not ammonia.
</P>
<P>
   12. Peterson prefers to buy shrimp uncooked because it is so
easily overcooked. Also, he prefers to buy shrimp in the shell,
because it has more flavor.

<P>
   1 tablespoon whole-grain mustard (moutarde de Meaux)
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup heavy cream, whipped
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground white pepper
</P>
<P>
   Tomatoes:
</P>
<P>
   2 ripe tomatoes
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper
</P>
<P>
   Cut each fillet into two 3-inch squares. If fillets are more
than 1/2-inch thick, butterfly them by cutting sideways almost all
the way through with a sharp knife and folding them open so they
end up between 1/4 and 1/2 inch thick.
</P>
<P>
   Whisk together mustard and whipped cream. Season to taste with
pepper; refrigerate until needed.
</P>
<P>
   Cut tomatoes in half crosswise, squeeze each half to eliminate
seeds, and chop coarsely. Cook tomatoes over medium heat in small
saucepan, stirring every few minutes to prevent sticking. When
tomatoes have cooked down to a thick paste, after about 15 minutes,
work through strainer with the back of a small ladle. Season tomato
sauce with salt and pepper to taste.
</P>
<P>
   Light broiler and heat large dinner plates in 200 degree oven.
(If you have only one oven, leave the door open so plates don't get
too hot.) Arrange fish fillets _ most attractive side up _ on a
baking sheet brushed with olive oil, and spread about 1/2
tablespoon of mustard sauce on top of each fillet. Heat tomato
sauce on low heat or in bowl in microwave.
</P>
<P>
   Slide baking sheet under broiler so tops of fillets are within 2
inches of heat source. You may have to move baking sheet around so
each fillet cooks evenly. Broil until sauce on each fillet sizzles
and browns lightly, 1 1/2 to 3 minutes. (The fish cooks most of the
way through under the broiler; the underside cooks on the plates.)
</P>
<P>
   Spread the tomato sauce in a circle in center of each of the hot
plates. Place a hot fillet in center of sauce and serve
immediately.

<P>
   FOR ``FRESH'' FISH, TRY ASIAN MARKETS
</P>
<P>
   Although mainstream supermarkets offer a solid selection of
seafood, area Asian markets are swimming with the stuff _ often,
quite literally.
</P>
<P>
   Most Asian markets get their big shipments of fish on Fridays,
making it fresh for the weekend. Often, crates are piled on the
floor, filled with live blue crabs, periwinkles, iced-down king
fish, milk fish and black pomfret. There are whole squid bodies,
cleaned of their pins and tentacles, and there are plastic bags
full of octopuses.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the usual supermarket offerings are also available _ but
with a difference. The shrimp are often sold with their head on,
perfect for stock or bisque. The catfish are often alive in a tank.
Ask the fish man, and he'll plop the catfish on the floor so you
can see how lively it is. If it's lively enough for you, he'll
dispatch it in front of your eyes. Now that's fresh.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   The seafood diet
</P>
<P>
   The average American ate just over 12 pounds of seafood in 1997.
Here's how it breaks down by species:
</P>
<P>
   Tuna, 3.1 pounds
</P>
<P>
   Shrimp, 2.7 pounds
</P>
<P>
   Pollock from Alaska, 1.6 pounds
</P>
<P>
   Salmon, 1.3 pounds
</P>
<P>
   Cod, 1.0 pound
</P>
<P>
   Catfish, 1.0 pound
</P>
<P>
   Clams, 0.5 pound
</P>
<P>
   Crab, 0.4 pound
</P>
<P>
   Flounder/Sole, 0.3 pound
</P>
<P>
   Halibut, 0.3 pound

   Now that you've picked it out, here's how to cook it.
</P>
<P>
   WHOLE BAKED RED SNAPPER
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4
</P>
<P>
   One (3- to 4-pound) or two (1 1/2- to 2-pound) red snappers,
gutted, gills removed and scales left on
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper
</P>
<P>
   Extra-virgin olive oil and lemon wedges, for serving
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Rub fish with olive oil and place
in an oiled oval pan, gratin dish or sheet pan. Bake for about 15
minutes per inch of thickness at thickest part. Check for doneness
by carefully sliding a paring knife into the back at the thickest
part, gently lifting top fillet and peeking inside to make sure
fish pulls away from the bone and the flesh is opaque (but still
moist), rather than translucent and raw.
</P>
<P>
   Serve on hot plates in dining room. Let guests season their own
fish with salt, pepper, olive oil and lemon.
</P>
<P>
   Other fish: This technique also works with such whole fish as
blackfish, black sea bass, freshwater bass, drums, porgy, rockfish,
sea robin, sea trout, tilapia and weakfish.

</P>
<P>
   SALMON FILLETS WITH WHITE WINE, BUTTER AND PARSLEY
</P>
<P>
   Serves 2
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 tablespoons unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   Two 6-ounce center-cut salmon fillets, about 1 1/2 inches thick
at the thickest part, skin and pin bones removed
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons dry white wine
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon finely chopped parsley
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper
</P>
<P>
   With a third of the butter, butter a square microwave-safe
casserole dish with lid. Place salmon in the casserole, folding
stomach flaps under salmon fillets so the fillets are of even
thickness, and sprinkle with wine. Dot salmon with remaining
butter. Sprinkle on parsley, salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Set 2 wide soup plates in microwave. Cover casserole and place
it in microwave on top of soup plates. Heat on high for 5 minutes
(less if the fillets are thinner than 11/2 inches). If your
microwave does not have a turntable, give the casserole 3 quarter
turns, one every minute, so the salmon cooks evenly. Remove
casserole and let sit for 2 minutes _ don't open it _ before
serving.
</P>
<P>
   Use spatula to transfer fish to hot plates. If you wish, peel
skin off salmon steaks. Spoon on the liquid left in the casserole,
and serve immediately.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For Hispanics, the long march to political power
began shortly after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Like many Americans, tens of thousands of Hispanics who joined
the military found that the war had forever changed their outlook.
Sent to bases across the country and overseas, they saw a world
outside their barrios in the Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time, they were able to see how people lived and
were treated outside of California and Texas,'' says John Garcia,
an expert on Hispanic politics at the University of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   In those days Mexican Americans in Texas could not serve on
grand juries or draft boards, and most attended de facto segregated
schools. Many were refused service in restaurants, and few voted
because of a poll tax. In California, they found segregation _
except in housing _ less widespread, but discrimination was
rampant. ``Pachuco'' was a common epithet that they heard. It was
the equivalent of ``nigger'' or ``wop.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, thousands of Hispanic veterans took advantage of the G.I.
Bill and went to college, forming the nucleus of a small
professional class. Self-help groups sprang up. One was the
Community Service Organization (CSO), founded in 1947 in Los
Angeles to fight discrimination in the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   CSO quickly became involved in local politics. For example, it
conducted a strong voter registration drive that was key to the
election of Edward R. Roybal to the Los Angeles City Council in
1949. He was the first Mexican American elected to the council in
the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in Texas a physician named Hector Garcia and other
veterans in Corpus Christi had started the American GI Forum to
protect the rights of Mexican-American veterans.
</P>
<P>
   An incident in the town of Three Rivers, 65 miles northwest of
Corpus Christi, outraged Garcia and led him to launch a national
campaign against discrimination. Through his efforts, media from
around the country focused on Three Rivers, where a funeral home
director had refused to let the family of a deceased Army private,
Felix Longoria, hold a wake because he was Hispanic. As a result of
the publicity, Longoria was buried with honor in Arlington National
Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican Americans, although shunned by Democratic and Republican
party bosses, continued to run for office during the 1950s. But
with little money, most of their campaigns failed.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the decade, some Hispanic leaders recognized that
their candidates needed more help from their own communities if
they were to succeed. So in 1959, 150 activists gathered in Los
Angeles and founded the Mexican American Political Association.
MAPA, which later established branches throughout the Southwest,
sought to get Mexican-American candidates from either party
elected.
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1960 the Viva Kennedy campaign began.
</P>
<P>
   Realizing that the election between Democrat John Kennedy and
Republican Richard Nixon was going to be close, Kennedy aides
fanned out in the Southwest setting up Viva Kennedy clubs to bring
out the Hispanic vote.
</P>
<P>
   On election day, these voters proved crucial to Kennedy's
victory in Texas. Some precincts in El Paso, for instance, went 100
percent for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the Anglo vote split fairly evenly in Texas, the Latino
vote carried the day for Kennedy,'' says Louis DeSipio of the
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, an expert on Hispanic
political movements.
</P>
<P>
   The next year Henry B. Gonzalez of San Antonio won a special
election to become the first Hispanic congressman in modern times.
In 1962 Roybal won a U.S. House seat from Los Angeles. The Senate
already had Dennis Chavez of New Mexico, who served from from 1935
to 1964, when he stepped down and was replaced by Joseph Montoya.
</P>
<P>
   While some Mexican Americans celebrated these victories, others,
particularly young people, charged that both the Democratic and
Republican parties were still refusing to back Hispanics
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The young activists tried a more confrontational approach. Some
pointed to the federal funds given to African Americans following
riots in black neighborhoods during the 1960s and argued that
Hispanics needed to use similar methods to attract national
attention and government aid.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most important groups formed in that period was La
Crusada Para La Justicia. Started in Denver in 1965 by Rodolfo
``Corky'' Gonzales, a poet and former boxing champion, the group
supported high school strikes, organized demonstrations against
police brutality and protested against the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   Many non-Hispanic whites saw Gonzales' organization as a
dangerous threat to society, but some militant Hispanics felt it
didn't go far enough.
</P>
<P>
   In 1967, Reies Tijerina and about 40 armed supporters took
control of the Rio Arriba County courthouse in the northern New
Mexico town of Tierra Amarilla. Tijerina released 11 prisoners who
had been arrested in connection with his plan to take over lands in
the Kit Carson National Forest.
</P>
<P>
   After a shootout with police, Tijerina and his supporters fled
into nearby mountains. Eventually, the National Guard captured him
and 17 of his supporters. He was later acquitted of the charges
resulting from the raid.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic militancy also was showing up in the political arena. In
1970, Jose Angel Gutierrez and other activists at St. Mary's
University in San Antonio founded a third party called La Raza
Unida. It sought to gain political control of Texas communities
with significant Mexican-American majorities.
</P>
<P>
   The LRU, which called for instruction in Spanish in all American
schools and increased government aid for the poor, found its
greatest success in Crystal City, about 100 miles southwest of San
Antonio. There, the party's candidates won control of the city
council and board of education in 1970. The LRU also managed to get
candidates elected in 22 Texas counties that year. Two years later,
an LRU candidate, Ramsey Muniz, ran for governor but won only about
6 percent of the vote.

SUPREME COURT WEIGHS ENVIRONMENT AGAINST PROPERTY RIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court on Wednesday took up the question
of how far a city can go in infringing on property rights to
protect an endangered butterfly and the area it needs to live in.
</P>
<P>
   At issue was the use of regulations by the city of Monterey,
Calif., to block the development of privately-owned land in order
to save habitat for the Smith Blue Butterfly.
</P>
<P>
   The court's decision could provide new guidelines on the
government's obligation to compensate landowners when it limits the
use of their property.
</P>
<P>
   Michael M. Berger, representing the former owner of the land,
Del Monte Dunes at Monterey, Ltd., said the firm had tried to work
with the city to develop the land in a way that wouldn't hurt the
habitat but that the city had refused to cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   Berger said his client had been ``simply strung along and abused
at the city's whim. ... What you have here is a pattern of abuse''
to ``protect a butterfly that nobody's ever seen there.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger told the justices that although the city had said that
the land could be developed, it rejected five plans offered by Del
Monte Dunes to build residential housing on the tract. He added
that each of the plans, which were submitted between 1983 and 1986,
had provisions to protect the area's buckwheat plants, which are
needed by the butterfly.
</P>
<P>
   But Monterey's lawyer, George A. Yuhas, contended the Del Monte
Dunes development plans never adequately addressed how the company
would protect the environmentally-sensitive area. That failure, he
said, left the city with no choice but to reject the plans.
</P>
<P>
   He said the company was unwilling to accept the city's zoning
regulations, which would have allowed the firm to build on 5.1
acres of the 37.6-acre tract.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Smith Blue Butterfly, Yuhas said the city relied on a
study by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, which said that
although the development did not threaten the existence of the
butterfly, it would destroy the important buckwheat habitat, which
could be used by later generations of the butterfly.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, after being turned down for the fifth time, Del Monte
Dunes sued the city, claiming Monterey had violated the so-called
``takings clause'' in the Constitution's Fifth Amendment, which
says that ``private property shall not be taken for public use
without just compensation.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the company argued before a U.S. District Court jury
that although Monterey had not physically taken the land away from
Del Monte Dunes, the city's regulations had made it impossible for
the firm to do anything with it. The company finally sold the
property in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The federal jury awarded the firm $1.45 million dollars in
damages. Monterey appealed the decision to the U.S. 9th Circuit
Court of Appeals and lost the appeal in 1996. Now the Supreme Court
must decide whether the jury's award can stand.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Antonin Scalia appeared to agree with Berger when he
questioned why the city had refused five separate plans to develop
the land.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though there's a reasonable explanation for the fifth
denial, or the third denial, or the second denial, after a while,
you begin to smell a rat,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yuhas argued that when environmental issues arise in connection
with land development, the decisions should be made by the
government, not private industry.
</P>
<P>
   Every government decision on environmentally-sensitive areas
would be jeopardized if ``all a developer needs to say is that `we
have an expert that says the regulation is excessive,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of Del Monte Dunes in friend-of-the-court briefs
included the American Farm Bureau Federation, National Association
of Home Builders, National Association of Realtors and National
Cattlemen's Beef Association.
</P>
<P>
   Backing the city of Monterey were the National League of Cities,
National Conference of State Legislatures, National Association of
Counties, U.S. Conference of Mayors and 29 states.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For Hispanics, the long march to political power
began shortly after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Like many Americans, tens of thousands of Hispanics who joined
the military found that the war had forever changed their outlook.
Sent to bases across the country and overseas, they saw a world
outside their barrios in the Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time, they were able to see how people lived and
were treated outside of California and Texas,'' says John Garcia,
an expert on Hispanic politics at the University of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   In those days Mexican Americans in Texas could not serve on
grand juries or draft boards, and most attended de facto segregated
schools. Many were refused service in restaurants, and few voted
because of a poll tax. In California, they found segregation _
except in housing _ less widespread, but discrimination was
rampant. ``Pachuco'' was a common epithet that they heard. It was
the equivalent of ``nigger'' or ``wop.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, thousands of Hispanic veterans took advantage of the G.I.
Bill and went to college, forming the nucleus of a small
professional class. Self-help groups sprang up. One was the
Community Service Organization (CSO), founded in 1947 in Los
Angeles to fight discrimination in the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   CSO quickly became involved in local politics. For example, it
conducted a strong voter registration drive that was key to the
election of Edward R. Roybal to the Los Angeles City Council in
1949. He was the first Mexican American elected to the council in
the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in Texas a physician named Hector Garcia and other
veterans in Corpus Christi had started the American GI Forum to
protect the rights of Mexican-American veterans.
</P>
<P>
   An incident in the town of Three Rivers, 65 miles northwest of
Corpus Christi, outraged Garcia and led him to launch a national
campaign against discrimination. Through his efforts, media from
around the country focused on Three Rivers, where a funeral home
director had refused to let the family of a deceased Army private,
Felix Longoria, hold a wake because he was Hispanic. As a result of
the publicity, Longoria was buried with honor in Arlington National
Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican Americans, although shunned by Democratic and Republican
party bosses, continued to run for office during the 1950s. But
with little money, most of their campaigns failed.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the decade, some Hispanic leaders recognized that
their candidates needed more help from their own communities if
they were to succeed. So in 1959, 150 activists gathered in Los
Angeles and founded the Mexican American Political Association.
MAPA, which later established branches throughout the Southwest,
sought to get Mexican-American candidates from either party
elected.
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1960 the Viva Kennedy campaign began.
</P>
<P>
   Realizing that the election between Democrat John Kennedy and
Republican Richard Nixon was going to be close, Kennedy aides
fanned out in the Southwest setting up Viva Kennedy clubs to bring
out the Hispanic vote.
</P>
<P>
   On election day, these voters proved crucial to Kennedy's
victory in Texas. Some precincts in El Paso, for instance, went 100
percent for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the Anglo vote split fairly evenly in Texas, the Latino
vote carried the day for Kennedy,'' says Louis DeSipio of the
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, an expert on Hispanic
political movements.
</P>
<P>
   The next year Henry B. Gonzalez of San Antonio won a special
election to become the first Hispanic congressman in modern times.
In 1962 Roybal won a U.S. House seat from Los Angeles. The Senate
already had Dennis Chavez of New Mexico, who served from from 1935
to 1964, when he stepped down and was replaced by Joseph Montoya.
</P>
<P>
   While some Mexican Americans celebrated these victories, others,
particularly young people, charged that both the Democratic and
Republican parties were still refusing to back Hispanics
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The young activists tried a more confrontational approach. Some
pointed to the federal funds given to African Americans following
riots in black neighborhoods during the 1960s and argued that
Hispanics needed to use similar methods to attract national
attention and government aid.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most important groups formed in that period was La
Crusada Para La Justicia. Started in Denver in 1965 by Rodolfo
``Corky'' Gonzales, a poet and former boxing champion, the group
supported high school strikes, organized demonstrations against
police brutality and protested against the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   Many non-Hispanic whites saw Gonzales' organization as a
dangerous threat to society, but some militant Hispanics felt it
didn't go far enough.
</P>
<P>
   In 1967, Reies Tijerina and about 40 armed supporters took
control of the Rio Arriba County courthouse in the northern New
Mexico town of Tierra Amarilla. Tijerina released 11 prisoners who
had been arrested in connection with his plan to take over lands in
the Kit Carson National Forest.
</P>
<P>
   After a shootout with police, Tijerina and his supporters fled
into nearby mountains. Eventually, the National Guard captured him
and 17 of his supporters. He was later acquitted of the charges
resulting from the raid.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic militancy also was showing up in the political arena. In
1970, Jose Angel Gutierrez and other activists at St. Mary's
University in San Antonio founded a third party called La Raza
Unida. It sought to gain political control of Texas communities
with significant Mexican-American majorities.
</P>
<P>
   The LRU, which called for instruction in Spanish in all American
schools and increased government aid for the poor, found its
greatest success in Crystal City, about 100 miles southwest of San
Antonio. There, the party's candidates won control of the city
council and board of education in 1970. The LRU also managed to get
candidates elected in 22 Texas counties that year. Two years later,
an LRU candidate, Ramsey Muniz, ran for governor but won only about
6 percent of the vote.

   MIDEAST-TALKS (Erez Crossing, West Bank) _ In an impromptu
conclusion to Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's two-day
Mideast trip, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian
Chairman Yasser Arafat broke bread together for the first time,
dining and even bantering in a unexpected three-way luncheon with
Albright in a Palestinian guest house at the entrance to the Gaza
Strip. By Deborah Sontag.

   IMF-WORLDBANK (Washington) _ The world's finance ministers and

with a torrent of reports about building a ``new international
architecture.'' By David E. Sanger.

   CLINTON-IMPEACH (Washington) _ President Clinton said Wednesday
that members of the House should cast a vote of ``principle and
conscience'' on Thursday, as Democratic leaders polished an
alternative proposal designed to draw as many party members as
possible away from the Republican plan to authorize a broad
impeachment inquiry. By Alison Mitchell.

<P>
   SCI-LIZARD-RAFT (Undated) _ Fifteen iguanas on a tangle of
waterlogged trees, tossed into the Caribbean Sea by a hurricane,
have apparently sailed 200 miles from Guadaloupe to Anguilla,
scientists reported. Their report has wowed a community of
scientists that has been arguing since early in this century about
whether such journeys were even remotely possible, let alone
observable. By documenting the voyage of 15 large, land-loving
creatures _ enough to form a new population _ the study provides
the first clear-cut evidence in support of those biologists who
argue that seemingly impossible journeys like this could be
important avenue for the dispersal of species around the words. By
Carol Kaesuk Yoon.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Holding On'' is a determined exercise in nonjudgmental
documentary making. In what he calls ``A Love Story From the
Street,'' producer and director John Baynard delivers scenes from
five years of the hazy driftings of Donna Mercier and Luis
Santiago, from a tent on a Boston street to briefly occupied
apartments to campgrounds; the two hold on to each other except
when Santiago is doing time for shoplifting.
</P>
<P>
   He is a recovering crack addict who complains of hypertension,
diabetes, epilepsy, too much cholesterol, a failing lung, you name
it. She is being treated for chronic depression. They live on
disability checks, occasional help from her family and his
panhandling. When they come into some money, they binge; there they
go, all suited up, zooming off on their new motorcycle.
</P>
<P>
   They smoke a lot, weigh too much, don't manage their household
accounts very tidily and seem to be in an endless and failing fight
to get their lives together. They are as unprepossessing a pair as
has ever appeared in a television romance.
</P>
<P>
   Baynard's achievement is to offer viewers a close-up of lives
that do not usually invite inspection; at their most sympathetic,
they can be off-putting. Santiago in particular, though he shows
symptoms of self-regard, has little charm to spare. ``We're there
for each other,'' he says, but mainly he seems to be there when Ms.
Mercier can do something for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm all out of whack,'' he says in a plausible diagnosis. He's
a whiner, whose main redeeming quality, as evidenced here, is his
appeal to the infatuated Ms. Mercier. She just can't get enough of
him. Her father says, ``We're very sorry she's involved with such
an idiot,'' but she remains chronically or clinically loyal.
</P>
<P>
   The viewer, like her father, may see Santiago's jail term as an
opportunity for her to be rid of him, but no such luck. ``I miss
him a lot,'' she says. He may not be much, but what really scares
her is the prospect of losing her man.
</P>
<P>
   In their moments of cuddling, she looks more like his mother
than his squeeze. ``The worst that could happen to anybody,'' she
says, ``is to be alone.''
</P>
<P>
   The kindly disposed viewer may find a saving grace in their
relationship. Without Santiago, Ms. Mercier, aging fast, would be
on her own with the demons of depression; without her, it seems
doubtful that he could survive his impulse to self-destruction.
</P>
<P>
   The more hard-boiled or judgmental viewer may see dysfunction
running rampant. If Ms. Mercier could find the strength to shake
off Santiago, maybe her existence would take on some order. But
loneliness is probably too high a price to pay for that.

 &HT;    Jay-Z knocks the money myth
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   At first, this doesn't seem like such rough living: Posing with
a black Bentley on the cover of the follow-up to your
million-selling album, screaming out ``Money Ain't a Thing'' as you
switch lanes in your Range Rover, and dedicating a song to all the
money and women you supposedly have.
</P>
<P>
   But what distinguishes Jay-Z from the plethora of other material
rappers is that his material goes much deeper, dealing smartly and
melodically with the untrustworthy people and trouble such
pleasures attract.
</P>
<P>
   As catchy as the bubbly ``Can I Get a ...'' is, stop moving a
minute and listen to it and what you'll hear is a paranoid rant:
``Can I hit it in the morning without giving you half of my dough?
And even worse if I was broke would you want me?'' he begins. ``A
Week Ago,'' with Atlanta's Too Short, details how longtime friends
can turn on you. This ends up really being a ``Hard Knock Life.''
But the inclusion of a lithe beat usually means that no song weighs
as heavy as some of the themes, nor are ``Paper Chase''-like tunes
as transparent as the diamonds they go on about. Like the work of
the late Notorious B.I.G., Jay-Z proves that one tune can be both
something you can dance to and something to think about.

   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   The eponymous title of journeyman rocker John Mellencamp's 17th
album, and his first for Columbia Records, is clearly meant to
signal a fresh start. But while 1996's ``Mr. Happy Go Lucky''
showed flashes of adventurousness, including a stab at heartland
hip-hop with the tune ``Emotional Love,'' the new album mostly
covers familiar ground. That said, it's a solid collection of
songs, with the standouts being the reggae-flavored ``I'm Not
Running Anymore'' and the somber ``Eden Is Burning,'' which offers
a not-so-happy ending to that little ditty about ``Jack and
Diane.''

<P>
   In the opening skit, Kirk Franklin is charged with being a
secular artist posing as a Christian. Surely a man unafraid to
incorporate rap (``Revolution''), rock guitars (``Riverside'') and
bump-and-grind man R. Kelly (``Lean on Me'') on one album and call
it gospel is guilty of such an accusation? Well, no. The force
behind the best-selling album in this genre (1997's ``God's
Property'') can only be found capable _ not culpable _ of crafting
an incredibly inspiring effort bigger than its seemingly
conflicting parts.

<P>
   Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   Christian pop acts have for so long been blandly derivative of
slightly moldy trends that the time is finally ripe for crossover
successes. Not because the bands are becoming more original, but
rather because modern rock formats, especially, have encouraged so
many cookie-cutter grunge and Hootie-type bands to flourish that
they suddenly fit right in. Just add Jesus, and some poor
articulation for ambiguity's sake, and you've got a platinum-seller
like Creed. The trio dcTalk is perhaps the slickest in the genre.
Its new album, a commercial breakthrough, doesn't miss a move. Most
accomplished when seamlessly generic (the Seal-sleek ``Wanna Be
Loved''), the music only occasionally is awkward or obvious (the
accusatory ``My Friend (So Long)''). Yet you wonder when such
overtly earnest performers will ever speak in their own words.

 &HT;    Chic, twisty `Murder' is guilty fun
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``A Perfect Murder'' (R)
</P>
<P>
   This B-movie remake of ``Dial M for Murder,'' shot in the deep
mahoganies of a Rembrandt painting and decked out in Fifth Avenue
fashions, isn't exactly perfect. But it's guilty fun. Its thrills
come equally from the twisty plot (no-good Michael Douglas schemes
to off his trust-fund wife, Gwyneth Paltrow) and our vicarious
pleasure in prowling around the troubled couple's oh-so-chic
penthouse.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas plays his signature role: scum-sucking sicko with caviar
tastes, flawlessly attired by Barney's. Viggo Mortensen portrays
the classic starving artist, whom Douglas approaches to murder his
wife. The twist? Mortensen happens to be Paltrow's lover. Let's
just say things don't work out quite as planned.
</P>
<P>
   The film's second half involves the murder scheme's aftermath,
when the stakes are raised considerably by the arrival of David
Suchet as the police detective assigned to the case. (The movie
could have benefitted from more of his piercing, intelligent
presence.) Basically a plot machine, ``Murder'' puts its attractive
cast through a plot line that's twisty enough to keep us guessing.
It's a little too pat and airless to be a total kick. But you might
pick up some decorating ideas. Grade: B

11 GAMES TO GLORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It used to be so easy in Ye Olden Days. Finish the
season Sunday. Start the World Series Wednesday. Blow 'em out and
you could have your celebration Monday.
</P>
<P>
   No longer. Baseball has gradually morphed into basketball or
hockey. It is time to start referring to the Second Season in our
oldest organized team sport.
</P>
<P>
   No old-timer can possibly appreciate what it takes to win a
championship nowadays. People scoff when they are told that Duke
getting to the Final Four seven times in nine years in a six-game,
64-team tournament is just as impressive as UCLA winning 10 times
in 12 years in a four-game, 25- to 32-team tournament, but it is.
People similarly scoff when they are informed that the Bulls
winning six times in eight years in a four-tier NBA postseason is
an equal achievement to or better than the Bill Russell Celtics
winning 11 times in 13 years in a mostly two-round postseason, but
it is.
</P>
<P>
   And no old-time baseball guy wants to hear that it is
exponentially harder to win a World Series nowadays than it was
before the American and National Leagues split into divisions and
instituted a playoff system in 1969. But it most definitely is.
This is without even discussing the problems inherent in keeping a
team together in the era of free agency and arbitratration.
</P>
<P>
   John Schuerholz knows. He is the executive vice president and
general manager of the most successful major league baseball team
of the '90s _ the Atlanta Braves. Once again, he finds himself in
an apologetic mode as he attempts to explain how it is that a team
as continually successful as Atlanta has been since 1991 has only
one championship to show for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the general public has an appreciation of how
hard it is to win it all in this climate,'' he maintained, ``and I
know some people in the media don't, and they affect people's
attitudes. It is more and more difficult every year, and it is even
more difficult now just to get yourself into a position to win. The
whole thing is just more difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   During the Braves' reign as the National League's premier team,
they have faced six teams in the NL Championship Series. The
roster: Pittsburgh in '91 and '92, Philadelphia in '93, Cincinnati
in '95, St. Louis in '96, Florida in '97, and now San Diego in '98.
</P>
<P>
   It is an intriguing list. The Pirates fight a continuing battle
for survival. The '93 team was Philadelphia's only plus-.500 team
in the past decade. Cincinnati is a crumbling professional
also-ran. The Cardinals, Mr. Swat notwithstanding, aren't close.
And Florida? Oy!
</P>
<P>
   But Atlanta rolls on.
</P>
<P>
   All Schuerholz can do is put the Braves in a position to win.
Once you get to the postseason, what happens happens. There are
always memorable what ifs? It is part of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that Schuerholz has done one of the great general
managing jobs in history. Operating in a world that the Branch
Rickeys and George Weisses could never even comprehend, Schuerholz
has kept stirring the pot. The extent of the Atlanta turnover is
staggering.
</P>
<P>
   From the 1991 team that lost one of the handful of greatest
World Series ever played, two (2) players remain: Tom Glavine and
John Smoltz. From the 1993 club that lost to those star-crossed
Phillies in six games, add Greg Maddux. There was, of course, no
1994. Move to 1995 and add Chipper Jones, Javy Lopez, and Ryan
Klesko. From the 1996 team that came from 3-1 down to defeat St.
Louis in the NLCS, we have Andruw Jones, Eddie Perez, and Denny
Neagle.
</P>
<P>
   That means there are only nine players remaining from the team
that competed for the world championship just two years ago. That
represents some heavy-duty wheeling and dealing.
</P>
<P>
   There is no secret that the foundation of the team's success is
the magnificent starting pitching nucleus of Glavine, Smoltz, and
Maddux. It all begins with them, no question. During the '90s,
these three have combined to go 355-182 in the regular season. Not
bad. Led by Smoltz's 11-3 record, they are 30-19 in the postseason.
They clearly rank with any trio of starters you can name at any
point in baseball history.
</P>
<P>
   With the starting pitching anchored, Schuerholz juggles. The
Braves are a big-money team, and Schuerholz has never been hampered
by a skimpy checkbook. But money alone cannot guarantee success.
You need judgment, and Schuerholz has that.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the primary additions to the 1998 team, first baseman
Andres Galarraga and shortstop Walt Weiss. ``They have given us a
balance we needed,'' Schuerholz said. ``We were too lefthanded.''
</P>
<P>
   Replacing the aging Fred McGriff at first base with the
explosive Galarraga, a k a the Big Cat, was a coup in more ways
than one. The 37-year-old Venezuelan slugger is one of those
imposing clubhouse presences. The Braves have taken on a distinct
Latin American flavor (eight players from five countries), and the
Leader of the Pack is Senor Galarraga.
</P>
<P>
   Weiss, a switch hitter, is one of those ballplayers who will
undoubtedly fall through the cracks of history but will be
remembered by his teammates and employers as a reliable
professional who never cracked under pressure. He is battling leg
injuries, but when healthy, he has given the Braves a significant
leadoff presence while making all the requisite plays at short.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta bullpen is an Encyclopedia Brittanica entry unto
itself, but suffice it to say the problem has been addressed to the
apparent satisfaction of manager Bobby Cox. The Braves are ready to
go.
</P>
<P>
   Are they readier, or better, than in either '97 or '96? Who
knows? ``I feel good about this team,'' said Schuerholz, ``but I
don't know that I feel better than I did in other years. We have a
lot of experienced, levelheaded people. We are very capable of
winning.''
</P>
<P>
   So are New York and San Diego. But this is 1998, not 1968.
Somebody has to win 11 games, not four. It's not easy.

 &HT;    Balm from a musical touchstone
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now that she's won a Grammy Award and been reunited with her
long-lost daughter, Joni Mitchell has become more of a public
figure than she has been since the late 1970s, when her albums
began tilting toward the increasingly esoteric _ or were merely
overlooked. Her vast influence holds sway over a nation of Lilith
Fair devotees, but reaches so far beyond category that the
songwriter is a virtual touchstone, a link between artists as
diverse as funkateer Prince and jazz trumpeter Dave Douglas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taming the Tiger'' doesn't stretch toward any classic stature,
but the casual warmth of its songs, the breezy, if sometimes a
little busy, arrangements and Mitchell's mature, funny observations
on human nature mark it as thoughtful, conversational balm. Tunes
such as ``Love Puts on a New Face'' and ``Stay in Touch'' are
direct, emotional, but realistic sketches of psyche and eros in
action, buoyed by one of the singer's typically masterful studio
bands (saxophonist Wayne Shorter, drummer Brian Blade).
</P>
<P>
   As she sings on the title track, the album is also her response
to a music business that scarcely has a place for artists like her
anymore. ``Every song just a one-night stand,'' she laments,
flipping along the radio dial. ``Formula music, girlie guile!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Taming the Tiger''
</P>
<P>
   Joni Mitchell. Reprise. 11 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: The much-lionized songwriter talks about the
passion.

TAX-EXEMPT STATUS OF KACZYNSKI REWARD DELAYED UNTIL NEXT YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ David Kaczynski wrestled with his conscience, but
in the end told authorities that he believed his brother, Theodore,
was the Unabomber.
</P>
<P>
   Now he is wrestling the IRS.
</P>
<P>
   An aide to Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, said Wednesday that the
House would not take up a measure that would exempt from taxes the
$1 million reward paid to David Kaczynski, who has said he will
give the money to his brother's victims. Archer is chairman of the
House Ways and Means Committee, which oversees tax policy.
</P>
<P>
   Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for Archer, said the proposal came
too late as the House is scheduled to adjourn this week until
January.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, it's just too late in the year for any new
provision like this to move forward,'' Fleischer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a timing problem,'' he added. ``At this time of year, we
are literally flooded with billions of dollars worth of meritorious
tax proposals. When you open the gates to say yes to one, you open
the gates to say yes to all.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleischer declined to say whether Archer supported the measure
in principle. ``The chairman has not addressed the merits of it,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Archer's decision throws a wrench into the works for Sen. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., who sponsored the tax-exemption measure
in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were hopeful that this would happen in the fall,'' said
Mike Waterman, a spokesman for Moynihan. ``It's disappointing, but
we're going to doggedly pursue this.''
</P>
<P>
   Waterman said Moynihan may add the exemption to other pending
tax measures in the Senate before the current session ends. But
without the House's concurrence, the tax measure would die.
</P>
<P>
   Kaczynski and his wife Linda Patrik, of Schenectady, N.Y.,
received the reward from the FBI in August for providing
information that led to Theodore Kaczynski's April 1996 arrest in a
remote Montana cabin.
</P>
<P>
   In a wrenching decision, Kaczynski turned in his brother, a
former mathematics professor who had become a recluse. He contacted
the FBI after recognizing the Unabomber's published manifesto as
similar to Theodore Kaczynski's anti-technology musings.
</P>
<P>
   The Unabomber was responsible for an 18-year string of bombings,
beginning in 1978, that killed three people and wounded 23 others.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities dubbed the serial criminal the Unabomber because his
initial targets were university officials and airline offices.
</P>
<P>
   David Kaczynski has pledged that after paying taxes and lawyer
fees used to defend his brother from the death penalty, the
remaining sum would go to his brother's victims and their families.
</P>
<P>
   Because taxes alone could top $300,000, Moynihan introduced a
bill in the Senate on Sept. 25 seeking to make the reward
tax-exempt so that more of the money would go the victims and
families.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be ironic and I believe unjust if the federal
government were to diminish this selfless act by taxing the
Kaczynskis or those to whom they have agreed to pay the reward
monies,'' Moynihan said.

 &HT;    Cooking 101
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA_Pastry chef Kirk Parks demonstrates how to core a
pineapple with a melon baller, then darts over to advise exactly
when to add the sugar to the egg whites.
</P>
<P>
   He turns just in time to offer a tip for fishing a chip of
eggshell out of a batter. ``Use a larger piece of eggshell. It will
cling to it,'' he explains over the cacophony of whirring mixers
and cackling compatriots.
</P>
<P>
   He's the master of a three-ring circus, but it's not in his
usual kitchen at Nava, the popular Southwestern-chic restaurant in
Buckhead. Rather it's in a small model kitchen at the Wollaston
Smith Kitchen Design Center on DeKalb Technology Parkway.
</P>
<P>
   And the performers are students in a cooking class, one of
several offered at Wollaston Smith each month. Within two hours,
the nine students will be savoring toasted almond poundcake with
plum chardonnay sauce and coconut macaroons, a milk chocolate tart
with caramelized banana sauce and grilled red chile pineapples with
tequila poached peaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing like three desserts for dinner,'' quips Sherie
Watkins, 41, a graphics designer who loves to cook. She left her
husband and son to fend for themselves this Tuesday evening so she
could learn from Parks.
</P>
<P>
   Around the metro area, Watkins is among thousands _ from kitchen
klutzes to accomplished gourmet chefs _ who are flocking to cooking
classes to work side by side with a kitchen pro or sit back, watch
and sample the end results. Classes cover everything from
appetizers to desserts, pastas to pastries, American standards to
international exotica.
</P>
<P>
   And the quest for culinary prowess continues to rise. With an
average of about 20 students a class four nights a week, Wollaston
Smith's sessions are selling out with increasing frequency,
especially for popular cuisines like sushi, said culinary center
director Deborah Evans.
</P>
<P>
   At the Kroger School of Cooking in Alpharetta, which opened
three years ago, more than 3,000 students took a class last year,
up 7 percent from the previous year. When Ursula Knaeusel started
offering classes here in 1971, she averaged five students a class;
now she has to limit them to 40.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people are a little tired of fast food all the time,
and it can be so expensive to eat out in nicer restaurants, so they
are learning how to cook that beef tenderloin at home,'' said
Knaeusel, who offers single-session demonstration classes at her
Cheshire Bridge school on practical good cooking that doesn't
``require driving all over town to find the ingredients.''
</P>
<P>
   While she does all the cooking in her classes, opportunities
also abound for prospective students eager to get their hands
floury.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Consuegra, 43, of Roswell has been participating in a
four-week ``basics'' series at the Alpharetta Kroger. In the first
class, he and his classmates chopped, sliced and diced onions and
carrots to hone their knife skills. They also watched chef Matthew
Sheeter prepare several different stocks, to be used in subsequent
classes when students would made pasta, cook a variety of meats and
plan a dinner party.
</P>
<P>
   Consuegra is considering a kitchen redesign in his home, so he
said he was attracted to a ``basics'' course because ``I wanted a
good foundation in cooking to help us make those decisions.''
Throughout the series, he was exposed to all aspects of a kitchen,
from top-of-the-line ovens and countertops to cutting boards and
pasta machines. But his favorite activity was ``definitely sampling
all the class projects.''
</P>
<P>
   One of his classmates, Melanie Flanders, 44, is driving more
than two hours each way from North Augusta, S.C., for the series,
even though she's already an experienced cook. But ``I can always
use new ideas,'' she said. ``I used to live here and always wanted
to take the classes but never had the time. Now I do, so I decided
to make the drive and visit with friends afterward.''
</P>
<P>
   The social aspect is not lost on Philippa Kingsley, who teaches
Thai cooking classes in a kitchen designed for instruction attached
to her home. Kingsley offers some demonstration, but then gets
students involved in chopping lemon grass, dicing hot chile peppers
and patting out fish cakes. The five-hour class culminates with a
sit-down feast of such Thai classics as chicken and cashew nuts,
red curry roast duck and pad Thai noodles. The dinners usually turn
into jovial gabfests.
</P>
<P>
   Kingsley trained in Thailand and taught in the Netherlands
before moving to Atlanta to teach nearly three years ago. ``Most of
my students have eaten Thai food in restaurants or have been to
Thailand and want to re-create the experience,'' said Kingsley.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than rely on one instructor, Wollaston Smith and Cook's
Warehouse in Midtown draw largely on chefs from area restaurants.
The chefs who make the best teachers, says Wollaston Smith's Evans,
are those who are personable as well as knowledgeable. Their
success also depends on their ability to translate large-scale
restaurant recipes into home dishes that can be prepared with
supermarket ingredients and everyday kitchen equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Shaun Doty, chef at Mumbo Jumbo, relishes that challenge. He
recently told a class at Cook's Warehouse that he likes to try out
new recipes with cooking classes to see how well they might work
with customers. For instance, a turnip piccata with braised greens,
country ham and red lentils that he demonstrated at a cooking class
in August just showed up on his new fall menu.
</P>
<P>
   Knaeusel likes to experiment as well; she's never taught the
same recipe twice in the past 25 years of teaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``The variety keeps people coming back,'' she said. ``Just like
some people go to the movies or a sporting event, people come here
to be entertained, to meet people and to learn a little something
in the process.''

 &HT;    Forget evil spells _ use garlic for good taste, health
 &HT;    By Betty Parham
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``It is not an exaggeration to say that peace and happiness
begin geographically where garlic is used in cooking.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Marcel Boulastin, French chef
</P>
<P>
   ``One must be very suspicious of anyone who does not eat
garlic.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Romanian proverb
</P>
<P>
   Like fire and salt, garlic is elemental to cooking. We know it
was mentioned as far back as 3000 B.C., in the earliest Sanskrit
writings. We know it was there when the Pyramids were being built.
We know it was not there when the Israelites were wandering the
Sinai desert, because they complained bitterly about its absence.
We know the Vikings, the Phoenicians and the Crusaders all ate it.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike fire and salt, which people tend to take for granted,
perhaps there is no other food component that, through the eons,
has inspired as much passion as garlic.
</P>
<P>
   It has been revered as a protection against known and unknown
evils, and no less personages than Homer, Aristophanes, Virgil,
Pliny, Celsius, Hippocrates, Confucius and Mohammed have praised it
and hailed its reputed wondrous curative powers. Besides protection
against evil spells, garlic has been said to cure everything from
toothache to baldness. Some of these health claims have held up to
modern science, which in recent years has conducted numerous
studies showing that garlic is indeed curative in many areas.
</P>
<P>
   But, even apart from any association with good health, people
are as passionate about garlic today as ever, simply because of the
wondrous alchemy it evinces when used in cooking. The Internet has
some wonderful sites dripping with mouthwatering garlic recipes, as
well as health information, growing tips, gifts, festivals, history
and lore.

 &HT;    Light on milk, poundcake big on taste
 &HT;    By Marcia Langhenry
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A request for a Crisco Poundcake using evaporated milk brought
in several variations ... all heavy on the eggs and shortening and
light on the milk.
</P>
<P>
   The most common was this one, sent by William Moeser of
Tallapoosa, Georgia, which called for only 1/4 cup evaporated milk.
Our tester was skeptical but approved the end result.
</P>
<P>
   For a little more flavor, you could add a teaspoon each of
vanilla and almond extract, in the style of Martha Hunter of
Greensborol, Ga..
</P>
<P>
   ``This may not be the recipe Ann Parker is looking for, but it
is out-of-this-world good,'' Hunter wrote.

 &HT;    COLUMN: Pre-release fuss often a tempest in a teapot
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sometimes a movie's bark is worse than its bite.
</P>
<P>
   Meaning, something arrives in theaters amidst a storm of
controversy _ it's too sexy, too violent, sacrilegious. Then, after
all the noise has died down and the movie has long since gone to
video, you realize you remember the fuss more than you do the film.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for instance, the remake of ``Lolita,'' which opens
Friday. For over a year, the news focused on its initial failure to
find an American distributor, forcing its premiere _ oh, the shame
of it _ on cable TV (Showtime, last August). But lightning didn't
strike Showtime, and now ``Lolita'' is getting theatrical
play-dates around the country.
</P>
<P>
   As for the movie itself? Not great. Not terrible. Certainly
worth a look if you're interested; easily ignored if you're not.
</P>
<P>
   Another cloud of controversy has gathered around ``Happiness''
(set to open in Atlanta on Nov. 6), which explores pedophilia.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, you can check out these titles that caused more
of a stir off-screen than on:
</P>
<P>
   -- ``STROMBOLI''
</P>
<P>
   Sore point: Adultery.
</P>
<P>
   Ingrid Bergman, a near-saint in the public's eyes thanks to
roles in ``Casablanca,'' ``The Bells of Saint Mary's'' and ``Joan
of Arc,'' left her husband and child to live in sin with Italian
director Roberto Rossellini. And to have his children (one of whom
is Isabella Rossellini). And to make movies with him, the first of
which was ``Stromboli.`` Bergman plays a World War II refugee who
marries a fisherman to escape the brutality of an internment camp.
The film and its star were denounced by clergymen, congressmen and
Georgia state Sen. Frank Lunsford, who managed to pass a resolution
banning all movies either made by Rossellini or starring Bergman
from public airing in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``BASIC INSTINCT''
</P>
<P>
   Sore point: Homophobia.
</P>
<P>
   Gay and lesbian demonstrators disrupted both the filming and the
opening of this suspense thriller, starring Michael Douglas as a
police detective with personal problems who becomes involved with
the prime suspect in a murder case: a glamorous and potentially
lethal bisexual played by Sharon Stone. The protesters' point _
remember, this was long before ``Ellen'' _ was that so few movies
even bothered to portray non-straight characters that to assign a
big star and a big budget to one that trafficked in largely
negative images was, well, insensitive at best. Writer Joe
Eszterhas, who had already pocketed his $3 million fee, said he
supported the protests and that the director, Paul Verhoeven, had
ignored his suggested changes. These days, about all anyone
remembers about the picture is the scene where Stone crosses _ and
uncrosses _ her legs.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``THE LAST TEMPTATION
</P>
<P>
   OF CHRIST''
</P>
<P>
   Sore point: Religion
</P>
<P>
   All hell broke loose, so to speak, when Martin Scorsese decided
to film Nikos Kazantzakis' novel about Christ, which includes a
fantasy scene in which Jesus forsakes his mission and embraces a
``normal'' (i.e., sexual) life with Mary Magdalene. Not
surprisingly, this didn't go over well with traditional-minded
Christians. What was surprising _ and a bit sad _ was that some
demonstrators added an ugly anti-Semitic tone to their protests.
Lew Wasserman, chairman of MCA, the parent company of Universal,
found protesters outside his home while a plane circled overhead
with the banner, ``Wasserman fans Jewish hatred with Last
Temptation.'' Upon its release, the movie, starring Willem Dafoe as
Christ, caused a flurry of critical interest _ most of it related
to the nasty tone of the protests _ then disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``HUSBANDS AND WIVES''
</P>
<P>
   Sore point: Art imitates life.
</P>
<P>
   See, Mia Farrow, Woody Allen's longtime significant other, had
just discovered that he was having an affair with her 21-year-old
adopted daughter, Soon-Yi Previn (whom he has since married). Media
feeding frenzy ensued. Then came the release of his new film, about
the breakup of a marriage and a middle-aged guy's (Allen)
relationship with one of his students, a much younger woman
(Juliette Lewis). Farrow plays the part of the spurned spouse,
though in the movie the Allen character nobly doesn't act on Lewis'
infatuation (i.e., no sex). Allen insisted that the script had
nothing to do with his real life and that he had originally
considered playing the role filled by Sydney Pollack. Regardless of
which came first, the affair or the screenplay, this one is the
exception to the rule: a first-rate movie that should outlive its
``scandalous'' overtones.

 &HT;    MINI VIEWS: Reviews of the latest on video
 &HT;    By Steve Murray and Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   -- ``Lost in Space'' (PG-13) _ A movie that has all the flash
and depth of the latest Nintendo game. Based on the campy 1960s TV
show, ``Lost in Space'' throws in vicious space spiders, genetic
monsters, confusing time-travel elements and heavy doses of family
values. The film stars William Hurt, Mimi Rogers and Heather
Graham. There's also Gary Oldman as the evil Dr. Smith and
``Friends'' hunk Matt LeBlanc as the arrogant pilot Major West.
Predictably, the movie has an open ending, suitable for sequels.
Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Character'' (unrated) _ The 1997 Oscar winner for best
foreign language film, this dour but compelling Dutch import is
laden with Dickensian incident and a Kafkaesque sense of fate. Set
in Rotterdam in the 1920s, it's the tale of a relentless war waged
between a formidable father (Jan Decleir) and his illegitimate son
(Fedja van Huet). Not exactly a lighthearted romp, but so much
happens that you barely notice. Grade: B+

BC HOPING TO STEAL THURSDAY NIGHT SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Forget ``Seinfeld'' and ``Cheers'' and ``Wings.'' They
have signed off from their coveted Thursday night slots and gone to
syndicated TV heaven. For college football fans, ESPN Thursday
night games have emerged as part of their must-see TV lineup.
</P>
<P>
   You can count Boston College coach Tom O'Brien and his Eagles
among those who have made watching ESPN Thursday night games a
weekly ritual.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yeah, I always watch Thursday night football,'' O'Brien
said. ``There's always something that I might see that I might
like. Something that someone is doing on offense or defense.
College coaches steal from each other. I mean, we're the biggest
thieves in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, when the numbers of Heisman Trophy winner Doug
Flutie and Outland Trophy winner Mike Ruth will be retired, O'Brien
hopes his Eagles (3-1 overall, 2-0 Big East) can steal the
spotlight from No. 17 Virginia Tech (4-0, 2-0) when they take
center stage in this ESPN matchup of conference unbeatens at Alumni
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   After absorbing a 52-28 beating at Louisville Sept. 26, the
Eagles are pointing toward this as a statement game. An impact
game. An absolute must-win conference game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've prepared ourselves pretty well the past few
days,'' said senior running back Mike Cloud, the conference's
leading rusher (169.0 yards per game), who will run head-on into
Virginia Tech's No. 1 defense, which has allowed 216 yards per
game, including 58 rushing. ``Everyone loves to play at night,
under the lights, and to be the only team on TV. We're the only
(college) game on that night. The fact that we're playing a ranked
team, a very good team, basically, we just want to prove to America
that we're a legit team.''
</P>
<P>
   While BC's first loss of the season gave rise to many questions,
there have been few, if any, about the legitimacy of Virginia
Tech's defense, which has not allowed a rushing touchdown all year.
From the start of the season, the Hokies' defense has set the tone,
recording a 37-0 shutout at Clemson, limiting Miami to 37 yards
rushing in a 27-20 overtime victory at the Orange Bowl Sept. 19,
and holding Pittsburgh to 28 yards in a 27-7 victory Sept. 26 in
Blacksburg, Va.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most frightening thing about Virginia Tech is their
special teams,'' said O'Brien. ``You never know what's going to
happen. Two weeks ago at Pitt, they fumbled near their own goal
line and gave Pitt the ball at their own 1. Then they backed up
Pitt to the 8 and forced them to kick a field goal and wound up
blocking it.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Hokies had a blocked punt against Pitt, marking
the 10th time in the 12-year tenure of coach Frank Beamer that they
have had two blocked kicks in a game. They now have 65 blocked
kicks in 130 games under Beamer.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Tech's injury-riddled offense, however, has been
another matter.
</P>
<P>
   The Hokies had three starters injured against Miami: quarterback
Al Clark (sprained foot), fullback Cullen Hawkins (broken foot),
and offensive guard Josh Redding (knee). Against Pittsburgh,
Clark's backup, sophomore Dave Meyer, suffered a separated
shoulder, forcing Beamer to deploy Nick Sorenson as an emergency
replacement.
</P>
<P>
   Sorenson, a 6-foot-3-inch, 206-pound redshirt sophomore who
served as Clark's backup last season before switching to free
safety this year, has been tabbed by Beamer as the probable starter
Thursday night. Beamer, however, indicated Clark will be available.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al's been back and he's practiced,'' said Beamer, whose team
scored a 17-7 victory over BC last year on Clark's dazzling 42-yard
TD run with 12:29 left. ``I do think Al will be available to play
in this game, but we'll plan to start Nick because I'd just like
things to be settled and leave no question marks out there.''
</P>
<P>
   The only other lingering question: How will BC respond after its
drubbing at Louisville, the Eagles' worst loss since a 52-20
thumping at Notre Dame last year? It was a shocking setback in
which the Eagles were pistol-whipped by quarterback Chris Redman,
who passed for 362 yards and a school-record five TDs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Louisville game is something that happens,'' said junior
free safety Pedro Cirino. ``They out-game-planned us and they
outplayed us. But now we go into this Virginia Tech game, a Big
East game, with a big chance for us to make a statement.''
</P>
<P>
   What might that be?
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see,'' Cirino said, pausing. ``We'll see if we're ready
for the big time or not.''

 &HT;    Lillian Smith Awards honor Lewis, Cox
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.), whose memoir ``Walking With the
Wind'' recounts his role in the civil rights movement, and North
Carolina novelist Elizabeth Cox, author of ``Night Talk,'' are the
1998 winners of the Lillian Smith Book Awards.
</P>
<P>
   John Edgerton, chairman of the awards jury, praised ``Walking
With the Wind'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $26) as ``a story of quiet
courage of this self-effacing hero of the civil rights movement;
the narrative resonates with his voice, and the familiar story has
never been told so compellingly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Night Talk'' (Graywolf Press, $23) is the story of a black
girl, Janey Louise, and a white girl, Evie, who grow up in the same
house in the small-town South of the 1950s. Cox, a Tennessee native
who divides her time between Massachusetts and North Carolina,
explains that she wrote the book ``trembling in my boots.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I started out to write a book about a girl whose father had
left home, but when Janie Louise and her mother moved into the
house, they took over the book,'' says Cox, 56, whose previous
novels are ``Familiar Ground'' and ``The Ragged Way People Fall Out
of Love.''
</P>
<P>
   Several times while she was writing the novel she stopped
because she didn't feel qualified to write about race.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way I could continue was to tell myself I was writing
about human intolerance.''
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in the South, Cox witnessed intolerance. She entered
the University of Mississippi in the same semester that James
Meredith integrated the all-white school. ``I was always tolerant
about race,'' she says, ``but I was silent until I got to college.
That's when I began to speak my mind. In this book I was trying to
expose intolerance in a human way without trying to blame anybody
for being racist.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lillian Smith Awards, which celebrate their 30th anniversary
this year, honor books that contribute to a better understanding of
human rights and other social issues _ matters that were of concern
to Georgia author Lillian Smith a half-century ago. The 1944
publication of Smith's ``Strange Fruit'' _ about an interracial
love affair _ thrust the author into the spotlight as a champion of
human rights.
</P>
<P>
   The awards, sponsored by the Southern Regional Council, will be
presented at a Nov. 6 luncheon at the Sheraton Colony Squarein
Atlanta. Information: 404-522-8764.
</P>
<P>
   ABOUT FACE: Sometimes it pays to watch television. Atlanta
writer Iris Johansen was watching the Discovery Channel a couple of
years ago when it aired a program about forensic sculptors who
reconstructed skulls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it would be really interesting to do a book about
the subject,'' Johansen says.
</P>
<P>
   Months of research later, Johansen began ``The Face of
Deception'' (Bantam, $23.95), the story of forensic sculptor Eve
Duncan. Eve creates faces from skulls to help law enforcement
officials and grieving families crack unsolved crimes and missing
person cases.
</P>
<P>
   The face that the Georgia scientist is constructing, however,
makes her a target for a killer. As she searches for the identity
of the victim, she learns that the face she created belongs to a
very important man who happens to be alive.
</P>
<P>
   A former romance novelist with 9 million copies in print,
Johansen switched to suspense with ``The Ugly Duckling,'' which
became a million-copy best seller. She followed that with two other
thrillers, ``Long After Midnight'' and ``And Then You Die.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I like doing suspense novels,'' says Johansen, whose first
novel, ``Stormy Vows,'' was plucked out of a publisher's slush
pile. ``I like being able to put in all of these surprises.''
</P>
<P>
   There will be a sequel to ``The Face of Deception,'' Johansen
says, but no more after that. ``I don't want to limit myself. There
are too many stories I want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Johansen will sign books at 2 p.m. Saturday at Waldenbooks, 400
Barrett Parkway at Town Center Mall, Kennesaw. 770-427-7810.
</P>
<P>
   REVIVED BOOKS: Hill Street Press, the new publishing house in
Athens, is looking for a few good ideas from readers about what to
publish. The press is offering the Palimpsest Prize to anyone who
comes up with the name of a favorite out-of-print book to be
reissued. Readers can nominate fiction or nonfiction titles
published at any time, from a hundred years ago to last year, as
long as they are out of print. The only other stipulation is that
the nominated books be connected to the South, through the author
or the subject matter. The person who nominates the selected title
will receive a $100 prize and the opportunity to participate in
Hill Street's promotion. Nomination forms are available at
bookstores. The deadline is Nov. 1.

 &HT;    COLUMN: Stop driving? I'll steer clear of that notion
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL OCTOBER 11: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Celestine Sibley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Somebody wrote me a note in the Vent the other day. It said,
``Celestine, I think it's time you stopped driving.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to being flattered to get mentioned in that column,
I suffered mightily from the possible inference that I may not be a
good driver. I am, oh, I am.
</P>
<P>
   Ask my children and grandchildren. I taught every last one of
them to drive, and considering that I drive many miles in the
course of a week, I have had a pretty fair driving record.
</P>
<P>
   There was that truck on I-75 a few years ago. (He drove me into
the wall. I didn't nick him, but, of course, I did have to have an
operation on my shoulder and the truck driver didn't.)
</P>
<P>
   I recall that one of our sportswriters mentioned that it was the
kind of operation baseball players often have. He added, ``But
you'll never pitch for the Braves again.'' That restriction pains
me almost as much as the prospect of not driving at all. It's true
the Braves haven't called on me, but if they did, I'd hate to say a
little old accident impaired my pitching.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the time a woman in a formidable van whammed into
the rear of my car at a four-way stop sign. Could happen to
anybody, couldn't it? The truck driver she drove me into ramming
said somebody was always hitting him that way. The impulse to
attack a big truck at a stop sign probably rages in many an
otherwise humble heart.
</P>
<P>
   I am, if I do say so, a peaceable driver. I don't make menacing
gestures at other drivers, and I gave up name-calling when a fat
lady in another car rolled down her window and finished what was
apparently a spicy tirade by saying, ``And you're ugly besides.''
</P>
<P>
   I just drive _ and drive _ and drive. About 60 miles to and from
work, with some side trips on various errands to pick up children
or deliver children to schools. I drive to the mountains when I'm
asked, and to the beach when I have the time. That comes to
hundreds of miles.
</P>
<P>
   I started driving at age 14. (Mobile County put no restrictions
on you at that time.) My father thought a Model T was abundantly
safe and that I demonstrated wisdom beyond my years by making my
schoolmate passengers get out and walk when we came to the narrow
bridge across Seymore Creek.
</P>
<P>
   I think he was pleased that when we played hooky from high
school that time and went downtown, I parked beside St. Joseph's
Catholic Church instead of next door to the bawdyhouse, which the
aunt of one of my co-hooky-players ran. I confess that I didn't
have in mind the character of respectability at the time. There was
just more traffic near the bawdyhouse, and I was a brand-new
driver.
</P>
<P>
   I'm still respectful of heavy traffic, which seems to
proliferate every day. But a couple of weeks ago, when I came back
from having an accident _ rare, I vow _ near Columbus, I felt
warmed and welcomed by Atlanta's traffic.
</P>
<P>
   I knew the exits and the street names and the landmarks. There
was the gold-domed Capitol and old Grady Memorial Hospital and the
turn for Crawford Long Hospital, where some of our births and
deaths occurred. There was the 14th Street bridge, which we saw
a-building, and our very own home street for 17 years. The spire of
our church was just beyond Patterson's, where we had so many
funerals. It was good to be home.

 &HT;    Take these lessons home to enjoy
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   One look at a list of cooking classes and you'll get the idea.
Are you a beginning cook? There's a class (or a series) for you.
Want to go vegetarian? Check out the options. From ethnic to
down-home, confections to haute cuisine, there'll be a class
sometime in the coming months that will satisfy your whim. Here are
some recipes we culled from classes, ranging from a 10-minute party
dip to a three-part dessert. Your assignment: Try them, and eat.

<P>
   With Wild Mushrooms, Arugula
</P>
<P>
   and Extra-Virgin Olive-Oil
</P>
<P>
   Makes 4 servings
</P>
<P>
   Preparation time: 35-40 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Rising time: 30 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Cooking time: 7-9 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Mumbo Jumbo chef Shaun Doty demonstrated this dish for a class
recently at the Cook's Warehouse on Amsterdam Avenue in Midtown.
Making pasta proved to be easier than many thought, and this dish
was both simple and fabulous.
</P>
<P>
   3cups all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   4yolks and 1 whole egg, beaten together
</P>
<P>
   1/4cup plus 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1tablespoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1cup wild mushrooms, chopped
</P>
<P>
   1teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste
</P>
<P>
   1tablespoon garlic, chopped
</P>
<P>
   1/4cup chicken stock
</P>
<P>
   1cup arugula, washed and stemmed
</P>
<P>
   1/4cup Parmagiana Reggiano
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   2tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   3tablespoons diced tomato
</P>
<P>
   1tablespoon parsley, chopped
</P>
<P>
   Sift flour into a large metal bowl. Make a well in the center of
the flour by pushing it to the sides in a ring. Add the eggs, 1
tablespoon oil and salt. With a fork, slowly stir liquid
ingredients in a circular motion, incorporating some of the wall of
flour without breaking through it. When the mixture begins to come
together, incorporate just enough flour to form a loose ball. Be
careful not to add too much flour; you will not use it all. Remove
dough from the bowl and knead thoroughly to a smooth consistency.
The dough should not stick to the surface or your hands. Cover with
plastic wrap and let rest 30 minutes at room temperature. You can
make this in the morning and put in the refrigerator; pull out an
hour before putting through a pasta machine. Roll and cut into
fettuccine according to manufacturer's instructions that come with
your pasta machine.
</P>
<P>
   Bring large pot of salted water to a boil. In large skillet over
medium heat, heat 1/4 cup oil and add mushrooms, red pepper flakes
and garlic. Cook, stirring constantly, until mushrooms have
released some liquid. Add chicken stock and cook until reduced by
half. Add arugula, reduce heat to a simmer and cook until arugula
is wilted. Add fresh pasta to boiling water and cook 1 to 2 minutes
until al dente. Drain and add to sauce. Add cheese, salt and pepper
to taste and combine thoroughly. Finish with butter, tomato and
chopped parsley and serve immediately.

</P>
<P>
   This really is three recipes served up as one outstanding
dessert, compliments of Kirk Parks, pastry chef at Nava restaurant.
The great thing is, each of the three parts can stand on its own,
so don't be afraid to steal one part or another for your own
inventions.
</P>
<P>
   Toasted Almond Pound Cake
</P>
<P>
   Preparation time: 20 minutes Cooking time: 45-55 minutes

   1/2teaspoon vanilla extract
</P>
<P>
   1cup flaked coconut
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Line a cookie sheet with parchment
paper. In a clean mixer bowl add the egg whites and salt. With the
whip attachment, whip the whites on medium speed until foamy. Turn
the speed to high and add the sugar a little at a time until all
the sugar is in the mixture, and continue to whip until stiff,
shiny peaks are achieved, about 2-3 minutes. Sift the flour and
baking powder together; set aside. When the peaks are shiny, fold
the vanilla extract, flour mixture and coconut into the egg whites.
Spoon portions onto sheet and bake for about 12 minutes. They
should be golden.
</P>
<P>
   To assemble: Place about 1/3 cup of the Plum Chardonnay Sauce on
a dessert plate. Add a slice of Toasted Almond Pound Cake and
garnish with the Coconut Macaroons. Serve.

 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL OCTOBER 11: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Alma E. Hill

<TEXT>
<P>
   It's one thing to have legs that go on for days or feet the size
of an NBA player if you're Elle Macpherson or Shaquille O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   But when you're 12 years old and still growing, it's enough to
make the fashion police give up their beats.
</P>
<P>
   Finding youthful apparel for kids who have adult-size bodies can
be a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Many parents rely on department stores such as Sears and
JCPenney that carry plus lines for girls and husky styles for boys.
Both stores sell sizes up to 20 and offer styles and colors that
make a kid look like a kid. Some parents, however, have resorted to
sewing their children's clothing, while others order from specialty
stores and catalogs such as J. Crew, Lands' End and L.L. Bean.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, options are limited.
</P>
<P>
   Parents and kidswear experts say the key to finding the
trendiest looks in clothes or shoes is to shop around. They
recommend going before your child needs a special occasion outfit,
to cut down on the stress of last-minute shopping. Another
suggestion is to find knowledgeable sales assistants and inform
them of your child's clothing needs. Developing a relationship with
store personnel can go a long way to make shopping easier and
keeping up with incoming styles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find that that's often more helpful than a personal shopper
because you're working with someone right in the department who
knows the merchandise better,'' said Cindy DiCaprio, children's
wear buyer for Nordstrom. Shopping for kids _ no matter their size
_ can be a parental test of skill often mixed with trial and error.
</P>
<P>
   But Latonya Winfrey has become a pro at finding clothes for her
10-year-old daughter, Denesie, who wears a misses size 14. Winfrey
keeps it simple: jeans and loose-fitting T-shirts. When Denesie
needs an outfit for church or a special occasion, Winfrey usually
picks something from her own closet.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we can find dresses that fit her, we buy them,'' Winfrey
said. ``That's not an easy process.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Johnson has such a hard time finding jeans with a 36-inch
inseam to fit her 6-foot-2-inch daughter, Rachel Holm, 12, that she
orders direct from Levis.
</P>
<P>
   And Debra Hickson puts a lot of miles on her car looking for
size 18 shoes for her 12-year-old, 240-pound son, D'Angelo. Cathy
Fleming used to go on shopping expeditions until she discovered
that Nordstrom has a good selection of shoes to fit her 12-year-old
daughter Laura's size 11 1/2 feet.
</P>
<P>
   But children's shoe and apparel manufacturers don't make
shopping easy.
</P>
<P>
   Girls have the hardest time finding youthful, sporty looking
clothing because junior departments typically target young women in
the size 2 to 12 range. Larger sizes in the women's or misses
styles often look matronly and are not as colorful as some of the
smaller sizes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a hole in the market for teens that is just not being
met,'' said Cara Kagan, editor of Girl, the younger version of Mode
magazine for plus-size women. Girl debuted on newsstands last month
and is scheduled for quarterly publication in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our research found that about 50 percent of teen girls wear
size 11or above. We're hoping that more and more manufacturers of
children's clothing produce sizes above 9. Everybody should have
beautiful, fashionable clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   Tips for shopping for an adult-size child:
</P>
<P>
   -- Tunic-length tops that cover the bottom are safe bets for
kids who are tall.
</P>
<P>
   -- For stocky children, look for pants with an elastic waist or
half-elastic waist. Tops should be loose fitting.
</P>
<P>
   -- Browse the children's and junior department to check out
trends. Then mimic those styles in misses/men's departments to give
children a youthful look.
</P>
<P>
   -- Check out big and tall shops.
</P>
<P>
   -- Elongate an outfit for a short, stocky child by sticking with
one color.
</P>
<P>
   -- Loafers or lace-up oxfords look best on long feet. Girls with
large feet should also look for something with a little heel.
Athletic shoes with a dash of color look better in larger sizes
than all white.
</P>
<P>
   -- Purchase brands that tend to be cut longer or wider, such as
Lane Bryant's Venezia line _ trendy garments aimed at women between
17 and 25 who wear sizes 14 to 28.
</P>
<P>
   -- Get to know the salesclerks at your favorite apparel or
clothing store. A good clerk will inform you when merchandise ideal
for your child comes in.
</P>
<P>
   -- Call manufacturers to find out if sizes can be special
ordered.
</P>
<P>
   where to go
</P>
<P>
   Here are some stores to check out when shopping for larger
</P>
<P>
   sizes:
</P>
<P>
   -- Nordstrom: Children's shoes ranging from size 4 to 14, widths
double A through double E. Boys/men's shoes from size 5 through 20,
double A through
</P>
<P>
   5E.
</P>
<P>
   -- JCPenney and Sears: Plus sizes for girls, husky sizes for
boys through size 20.

 &HT;    N.C. clan cleaves to embattled crop that has long meant a good
living
 &HT;    By John Harmon
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEACHTREE, N.C._In the fertile valleys of western North
Carolina, it's a scene as old as the Cherokee Indian.
</P>
<P>
   Under a pale blue sky, the tobacco leaves have turned gold under
the warm late summer sun, and the Barnett family harvests the crop
as they have for decades. Sweat soaking their shirts, the men spear
tobacco leaves with a stick. When full, each stick weighs about 30
pounds and is ready for hanging in the barn to cure.
</P>
<P>
   This is burley tobacco country. The cooler Appalachian Mountains
remain a refuge, a last stand of the small tobacco farms that once
were common throughout much of the South. Burley tobacco is
thin-leaved and milder than the strains that thrive in the hot
flatlands of the Carolinas and Georgia. It's still cured the
slower, old-fashioned way, by the cool, dry autumn air that passes
through weather-beaten barns. Flatland tobacco is flue-cured, by
propane gas heaters, and has a harsher taste. Cigarettes rely on a
blend of the two.
</P>
<P>
   In these mountains it's not unusual to see green tobacco patches
as small as a quarter acre, just a few steps from the kitchen door.
The crop is a throwback to a simpler era, with most of the work
still done by hand, from the planting to the bailing of cured leaf.
Thousands of families in the burley belt _ principally the hills of
Kentucky, Tennessee and North Carolina _ have relied on tobacco
when other crops have failed.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even this vestige of the traditional family farm is
endangered, threatened by cheap imports, proposals to do away with
government price supports and the moral dilemma of producing a
product that is linked to so much sickness and death.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, unlike their ancestors who long toiled these soils
for the profitable leaf, not a member of the Barnett clan smokes,
dips or chews tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   The moral issue is especially apparent for Randy Barnett.
</P>
<P>
   At 45, Barnett is the family's senior member. He has long grown
tobacco and tomatoes to keep the farm going, all the while pursuing
a career as a public school teacher. He is now principal at an
elementary school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifteen years ago, people were real proud of their tobacco,''
he says. ``People would take pride in showing off how pretty their
tobacco was.
</P>
<P>
   ``And now,'' he shakes his head. ``People think you are like a
drug dealer. The kids at school think its a bad thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Barnetts know firsthand of tobacco's pain. His father, Bill
Barnett, was a long-time smoker of Lucky Strikes. He died at age 72
of lung cancer. His grandfather, however, chewed and smoked cigars
until he died from old age at 94. Both men grew burley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do have mixed emotions about it,'' Randy admits, pausing to
wipe his brow and drink deeply from a chilled bottle of water.
``But tobacco has always been a good crop for us. It's really what
has kept us farming.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in the same water break, wife Clara, 44, who drives the
tractor pulling the trailer loaded with leaf, says: ``I would never
encourage someone to smoke.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Barnett's, a spacious ranch-style home overlooking the
red-painted barn, tobacco money has sent a child to college, helped
buy new cars and bought loads of Christmas presents.
</P>
<P>
   This year, for instance, the Barnetts hope to earn as much as
$5,000 from their patch of 1 1/2 acres.
</P>
<P>
   More than an income supplement, tobacco keeps the family morally
grounded on the land and with each other, they say.
</P>
<P>
   Since the burley crops are typically small, families usually
provide most of their own labor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gave us a lot of work ethic and morals as we were growing
up,'' says Amber Barnett Ledford, 24, who began working in the
patch when she was 4. ``Of course I hated it when I was a kid. I
appreciate it now.''
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco sent Amber to Western Carolina University. She now
teaches 7th-grade science. With her husband Jeremy, 29, a state
trooper, she continues to work alongside her mother and father and
her 15-year-old brother Aaron.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Congress created the tobacco stabilization program in
the 1930s, farmers have been able to bank on tobacco profits.
</P>
<P>
   The program established a system of quotas or allotments that
limits the amount of tobacco individual farmers can grow. It also
set up a loan program that provides money for farmer cooperatives
to purchase tobacco when prices are low and then sell it later as
prices rebound.
</P>
<P>
   While flue-cured tobacco has steadily become concentrated on
larger and larger farms _ some total hundreds of acres _ burley
farms have remained mostly small, less than five acres.
</P>
<P>
   Two things have kept the small farmer in the burley business,
says Blake Brown, a tobacco policy expert at North Carolina State
University.
</P>
<P>
   First, burley must be cut and gathered by hand _ unlike
flue-cured, typically harvested by machine. But more importantly,
he says, the allotment system has kept prices high enough for even
the tiniest patch of burley to be profitable. And since allotments
(for the most part) cannot be sold or otherwise transferred across
county lines, the system locks in place a network of small farms.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it wasn't for the quotas, there probably wouldn't be a
burley crop in the Appalachians,'' says Brown, who grew up on a
small tobacco farm in the highlands of North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without the quotas, some farmers would plant
fence-row-to-fence-row, so to speak, and flood the market with
tobacco. Then prices would fall and only large farmers who can take
advantage of the economy of scale would survive.''
</P>
<P>
   The fate of the quotas hinges on what Congress does about the
proposed $368 billion tobacco settlement. The issue appears dead at
least for this session, though a number of key members have vowed
to keep pursuing a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Thrown into the mix is a proposal to end all federal involvement
in tobacco production and compensating farmers with a government
buyout of their quotas. For the Barnetts, that could mean about
$30,000.
</P>
<P>
   And an end to four generations of farming. They quit raising
tomatoes a few years back, a crop that was once more profitable
than tobacco, when the local tomato packing house closed. It was
pushed out of business by the mega-farms of California, Florida and
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   In the late afternoon heat, the sharp odor of curing tobacco
hangs thick in the air. With cousin Phillip Pickett and friend Jeff
Beaver lending a hand, the men load a trailer with tobacco. Later,
Aaron arrives from football practice and joins in the work, as does
his sister Amber.
</P>
<P>
   Each load is hung from a framing of 2-by-4s which fills the
inside of the barn like scaffolding. One man crawls high up the
25-foot barn, while the others pass loads up to him in a process
that looks back-breaking.
</P>
<P>
   It's dangerous work that can literally make them sick. If the
crop is harvested while wet from rain or dew, the water-soluble
nicotine is readily absorbed through the skin, resulting in
nicotine poisoning or green tobacco sickness.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes you deathly ill,'' Barnett says. ``Nauseous, dizzy,
throwing up. It usually lasts 12 to 24 hours.''
</P>
<P>
   The family rarely harvests the crop when wet, except in rainy
autumns, when it's nearly impossible to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   That's another reason they feel blessed again this year. The dry
weather has made for ideal harvest conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know tobacco has its drawbacks,'' says Ledford, as everyone
chats outside the barn in the cool of the twilight. ``But so does
alcohol. Why just pick on tobacco? Why not pick on alcohol?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like this: I'm 29 years old and choose not to drink. But
I'm not trying to outlaw alcohol.''

 By WILLIAM L. HAMILTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Papa's got a brand new bag.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 15, Ernest Hemingway will become a home-furnishings
brand. The Ernest Hemingway Collection _ 96 pieces of living room,
dining room and bedroom furniture and accessories _ will be
introduced at the International Home Furnishings Market in High
Point, N.C., the wholesale furniture exposition.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Bruccoli, a Hemingway scholar, isn't surprised.
``Hemingway was the most astute self-publicist that America has
ever known,'' he said. ``His brand name has outlived him by 37
years. People who have never read a book recognize him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Branding'' _ attaching a name or trademark to a product to
give it an aura of value and a sales hook _ is a familiar strategy
in fashion, luxury goods and entertainment. But it is about to hit
consumers where they sit. And the pitch has an odd new roll call,
with famous names from the four corners of the pop-cultural map,
Coca-Cola to Greta Garbo.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Mackie, the Hollywood costume designer, will be at High
Point, too, with his own spin, as will the Central Park Conservancy
and the Professional Golfers' Association.
</P>
<P>
   Mackie will bring to seating the glamour he brought to Barbie.
Central Park hopes to hit pay dirt, initially with rugs from a
``casual age of innocence.'' For the PGA Tour, ``styling which we
hope will be popular with 26.5 million golfers'' could be straight
fairway or pure sand pit.
</P>
<P>
   The Cole Porter Memories collection _ including $1,900 copies of
zebra-cloth chairs from Porter's Paris apartment and a $142,000
replica of the Steinway piano he played at the Waldorf-Astoria _ is
being introduced Thursday by J. Peterman Co. at the opening of its
Grand Central Terminal store in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Source Perrier furnishings arrived at Pierre Deux stores in
August. The company has restocked twice.
</P>
<P>
   With a strong economy producing a record $59 billion in sales in
the year ended in July for the furniture industry, a gold rush of
unlikely licensing agreements is now under way.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Lauren, the Moses of cross-merchandising, was just the
beginning. He moved into furnishings 15 years ago. Retail sales are
now $700 million annually. Next year could be the year when the way
furniture is marketed changes forever.
</P>
<P>
   For spring, expect the Faith Popcorn Cocooning collection. Ms.
Popcorn, the trend forecaster, is negotiating with Barcalounger on
the initial product: a recliner for women that will include
features for nursing mothers and aromatherapy.
</P>
<P>
   For fall 1999, meet the Beatles. The Yellow Submarine, a
franchise being launched next year by the three surviving band
members, will include inflatable children's furniture. (``We all
live ....'') ``The Beatles said fine,'' said Del Furano, the
president of Sony Signature, the Beatles' merchandising
representative. ``I wouldn't rule out lamps and sofas. We
encouraged them in home furnishings _ it's an exploding category.
Everyone's nesting, and they want images from their past.''
</P>
<P>
   Home furnishings, humble stay-at-homes, are one of the last,
wide frontiers for the hard celebrity sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big, uncharted territory for branding,'' said Juliet
Schor, a Harvard economist and the author of ``The Overspent
American: Upscaling, Downshifting and the New Consumer'' (Basic
Books, 1998). ``Home furnishings don't yet have the level of brand
identification that so many industries do, like cars and soft
drinks.''
</P>
<P>
   Licensed branded products, including apparel, cosmetics and
toys, account for $80 billion annually in retail sales in the
United States, according to the Licensing Industry Manufacturers
Association. Home furnishings now represent $1 billion of that.
``It's one of the hottest segments of licensing,'' said Charles
Riotto, the executive director.
</P>
<P>
   Working with living celebrities, the estates of deceased
celebrities (or ``living legends,'' as licensing agents prefer to
call them) and big trademarks like Coca-Cola, which introduced its
bedding at a trade show this month, the furnishings industry is
banking on the hope that branding will help sales to its core
customers.
</P>
<P>
   Baby boomers, notorious for refusing to grow old, will be
encouraged to buy middle-aged merchandise like furniture by
identifying it with the eternal youth of popular culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have many heroes today, as the millennium
approaches,'' said Marla Metzner, president of Fashion Licensing of
America. She created the Ernest Hemingway brand with Hemingway's
three sons, Jack, Gregory and Patrick. ``We're going back to the
great icons of the century, as heroic brands.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Metzner also represents F. Scott Fitzgerald's grandchildren,
who have asked for a Fitzgerald brand. ``I see a line that would be
a mix _ from art deco to Ivy League,'' she said. ```The Great
Gatsby' is America's favorite novel _ and there's going to be a
made-for-television movie next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Monroe, Amelia Earhart and Greta Garbo _ an early
cocooner _ are under serious review, too. ``Symbols like brands
have become a part of reality, a halo,'' said Dr. Richard Shweder,
a cultural anthropologist at the University of Chicago. ``In India,
where I work, people believe water from the Ganges has a potent
positive power.''
</P>
<P>
   Does star power really give furniture sales a boost? The Arnold
Palmer furniture collection, introduced in 1996, is doing well. So
is Eddie Bauer's. Alexander Julian, the fashion designer, is a hit,
with $70 million to $90 million in wholesale business.
</P>
<P>
   But Bill Blass' stripped-down interpretations of his own
antiques have been labeled lemons by the industry. And Norman
Rockwell painted himself out of the picture with licensed designs
that didn't sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``The failure rate's pretty high,'' said Warren Shoulberg,
editor of Home Textiles Today, an industry publication. ``For every
successful Ralph Lauren program, there are two or three who fall
flat on their faces.'' The losers' circle is more crowded than the
winners' circle.

 &HT;    From `ER' to `Donny': Some random notes
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Television is the land without context, a place where randomness
rules. In the age of the clicker, this is more true than ever, as
restless viewers construct their own mosaic of mini-blips of shows.
</P>
<P>
   If it's good enough for television, it's good enough for the
Channel Surfer. Today's TV mosaic of random observations:
</P>
<P>
   -- In its first two weeks back, ``ER'' has been ``The Lucy
Show,'' as the series has focused on newcomer Lucy Knight (Kellie
Martin). She's cute as a button, but let's get back to the old
characters. Starting, say, tonight.
</P>
<P>
   -- Anybody worried that UPN's ``The Secret Diary of Desmond
Pfeiffer'' would topple the republic can rest easy. The debut
episode Monday night drew only 2 million viewers, a measly 1.6
percent of the TV audience, according to Nielsen. That's with big
articles in Time and Newsweek about the show.
</P>
<P>
   -- That new CNN set is so cool it makes you realize how cheesy
the old set was.
</P>
<P>
   -- NBC's new sitcom ``Will &AMP; Grace'' (9:30 p.m. ET Mondays) is a
moderate hit. It would be even better, though, if they got rid of
Will and Grace and made the show about the two wacko supporting
characters, Jack (Sean Hayes) and Karen (Megan Mullally).
</P>
<P>
   -- The second episode of ``Felicity'' (9 p.m. ET Tuesdays on WB)
was as wonderful as the pilot, cementing its rep as the best of the
new season's shows.
</P>
<P>
   -- A literary wag once said of Henry James' novels that he
chewed more than he bit off. For TV's equivalent, see CNN's
``Burden of Proof.''
</P>
<P>
   -- The new syndicated Osmond talk show ``Donny &AMP; Marie'' (check
local, listings) makes ``The Rosie O'Donnell Show'' seem relatively
nihilistic.
</P>
<P>
   -- Hail to Comedy Central's ``The Daily Show'' (11 o'clock ET
weeknights), which has started calling its coverage of the
Clinton-Starr-Lewinsky-Congress story ``Make It Stop.''
</P>
<P>
   SEEN AND HEARD
</P>
<P>
   Amanpour awaits visa
</P>
<P>
   CNN's star correspondent, Christiane Amanpour, has been frozen
out of Kosovo, Yugoslavia, the one place she and CNN most want her
to be right now. While Amanpour waits in London, the Yugoslavian
government is refusing to grant her an entry visa, says Eason
Jordan, president of CNN International. The government is upset
over a report Amanpour did about an alleged Serbian war criminal,
Jordan says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governments play games with visas sometimes,'' Jordan says,
``but there's still some hope.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, CNN's Brent Sadler is in Yugoslavia providing
Kosovo coverage for CNN.

ago with ``Sanctuary,'' a direct-mail catalog that included
Gothic-style home furnishings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was ahead of my time,'' she said of the self-financed
effort, which was brought down, she said, by mismanagement and
order-fulfillment problems. The collection will be reintroduced on
the Internet in November at www.cher.com.
</P>
<P>
   But Cher has no illusions about the allure of a name in the
furniture business. ``I don't think that has much to do with
furniture,'' she said. ``People look at something that's going to
come into their home and it either touches them or it doesn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Her friend and colleague Bob Mackie agreed. ``I'm not going to
pretend I'm this closet furniture designer,'' he said. Sketches of
the Louis XV-style furniture for his collection were presented by
the manufacturer, American Drew, a division of Ladd Furniture Co. A
five-piece bedroom suite will sell for a suggested $5,000 to $6,000
when it arrives in stores next spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope people will be buying the collection for the
furniture,'' Mackie said. ``Buying it because somebody's name is
attached _ that's a bad idea.''
</P>
<P>
   With the success of ``lifestyle'' home-furnishing retailers like
Pottery Barn and Crate and Barrel, celebrity lifestyle retailing
may not be an awkward reach; it is familiar ground to an adult
population used to cultural souvenirs like T-shirts and baseball
caps.
</P>
<P>
   Maureen Horn, director of home furnishings for Walt Disney
Consumer Products, will be at High Point this month, shopping for
licensees for a Disney home collection. ``Guests staying at the
theme hotels want to be able to buy the sofas and tables, so they
can couple their memories with the furniture around them at home,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   How dear are your memories? And at what price fame, for
furnishings manufacturers?
</P>
<P>
   The typical royalty rate is 1 percent to 5 percent, depending on
the power of your pull. ``Living legends'' like Marilyn Monroe can
go as high as 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Does the consumer get something original? More or less. Most
celebrity collections are much like the rest of the companies'
furniture, often at the higher end. The actual cost of developing a
medium-size celebrity collection like Mackie's is largely the same
as it would be for a group of unbranded furniture, which is
generally $200,000 to $400,000.
</P>
<P>
   The ``brand name'' _ living, dead or incorporated _ has a veto
on designs presented by the company, and a voice to suggest or
change. It is rarely exercised.
</P>
<P>
   ``PGA Tour had a consultant who looked at our ideas,'' said
Shelby Pulino-Pigot, the vice president of merchandising at
Vanguard Furniture and a designer of the PGA Tour collection.
``They never changed a thing.''
</P>
<P>
   What is one getting, then, at the end of the day, as one settles
into one's identity?
</P>
<P>
   ``Confidence and passion, and a romance mixed with life and
death,'' Ms. Metzner, the licensing agent for Hemingway Ltd., said
of the new brand that will have its premiere at High Point.
Thomasville Furniture Industries, the manufacturer, is introducing
four theme collections: Kenya, Key West, Ketchum and Havana. There
is no farewell to armoires: two are being offered. Sturdy but not
unstable.
</P>
<P>
   Thomasville conducted a focus group to gauge the market for the
brand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Negativity came up from about 5 percent,'' said James Adams,
senior vice president for sales and marketing. ``He married four
times _ this is Hemingway. He was a handsome guy. But there's an
edge to this, that kind of blows the bad stuff away.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one ever asked about what the furniture looked like. That's
a great collection.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Carroll, an editor at Furniture Today, said: ``The
industry has been chastened. No matter whose name you have, you're
going to have to pay careful attention to the product. If the
product's not exquisite, it's going to fail.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the sun also sets.

<P>
   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A slow-moving cold front will lift an ample supply of moist air
covering the East on Thursday, resulting in widespread rainfall. To
the north, the axis of heaviest rain with embedded thunderstorms
will shift from the central and northern Appalachians early
Thursday to the coastal plain by midday, and finally offshore late
Thursday night as the front gradually moves off the Middle Atlantic
and Northeast coasts.
</P>
<P>
   Given the slow movement of the front, rainfall amounts of
between { and 1 inch of rain are expected, with isolated higher
values.
</P>
<P>
   Farther south, clusters of showers and thunderstorms will
accompany the front through the Southeast. As the tail end of the
front stalls over the Gulf of Mexico, tropical moisture will be
drawn onshore, resulting in storms with locally heavy rains.
</P>
<P>
   Breezes from the north will send cooler and drier air through
the Ohio Valley to the western slopes of the Appalachians in the
wake of the front. Patches of residual moisture, however, may
trigger a few light showers near the eastern Great Lakes. Drier air
will spread across the Appalachians toward the coast late Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Sprawling high pressure will provide ample sunshine from the
upper Midwest to the western Gulf states, then westward to the
central Rockies and Southwestern states. Parts of the western
Plains will be 10 to 20 degrees warmer than on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Moist winds from the Pacific Ocean will follow a cold front in
the Northwest. Patchy coastal showers are expected across
Washington and Oregon, with snow possible above 6,000 feet in the
northern Cascades.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Ozone Hole
</P>
<P>
   Ozone, mainly a stratospheric gas that shields earth from
ultraviolet rays, has undergone its annual springtime depletion
over Antarctica. The ``ozone hole'' has been born again. During
Southern Hemisphere winter, air currents steer ozone to the South
Pole. There it sinks into the lower stratosphere, where chlorine _
a building block of man-made chemicals called chlorofluorocarbons _
lurks. As the sun appears, it photochemically frees chlorine to
devour ozone. Destruction tapers off and ozone rebounds after
October as the stratosphere warms and chlorine becomes dormant.

DOCTORS SCREENING FOR DEPRESSION SYMPTOMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you visit your doctor Thursday, you could be handed a simple
pencil-and-paper test in the waiting area to check for unsuspected
clinical depression, as National Depression Screening Day enlists
thousands of primary-care physicians in an effort to detect the
often-missed disorder.
</P>
<P>
   With less fuss than filling out an insurance form, the
10-question test asks about feelings and symptoms that could
indicate significant depression. Three additional questions probe
for signs of manic-depression.
</P>
<P>
   By the time you see the doctor, he or she or an assistant will
have scored the test, developed by Harvard Medical School
psychiatrists. If the results suggest depression, the physician can
ask more questions and get a better picture of the problems. With
today's generally safe and effective antidepressants, many
primary-care doctors will prescribe them as a first-line treatment,
while others will refer the patient to a mental-health
professional.
</P>
<P>
   Over 4,000 clinicians across the country will be screening an
estimated 100,000 people, said Barbara Kopans, associate director
of National Depression Screening Day, now in its ninth year. The
annual effort to bring more depressed people into treatment was
launched at Quincy (Mass.) Hospital in 1991 by Dr. Douglas G.
Jacobs, a Harvard psychiatrist who heads the National Depression
Screening Project.
</P>
<P>
   Another 100,000 people are expected to take a similar, but
longer, test and be interviewed at 3,000 public screening sites.
(Call 1-800-573-4433 to find the nearest site.)
</P>
<P>
   While some patients are aware that they may be depressed, others
come in with headaches, stomach pain, appetite and weight changes,
and other symptoms that can't be traced to a physical problem and
suggest the possibility of depression, said Dr. Meyer Bornstein, an
obstetrician-gynecologist. The test has been validated in
large-scale trials so that a positive or negative score can help
make the diagnosis or rule it out.
</P>
<P>
   Bornstein said that in most cases he refers patients who suffer
from depression to psychologists or psychiatrists. ``I really feel
I don't just want to put them on medication,'' he said. ``It
doesn't solve the whole problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Many primary-care doctors, however, are comfortable prescribing
an antidepressant and monitoring the patient's response over time.
If the patient doesn't get better, referral to a mental-health
professional is a second option.
</P>
<P>
   The screening day and the participation by primary-care doctors
are being sponsored by the American Medical Association, the
American Psychiatric Association, McLean Hospital, and several
other medical and mental-health organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Herbert S. Waxman, a vice president at the American College
of Physicians, one of the sponsors, said the organization has been
well aware that ``you find that a lot of people who are
significantly depressed in primary care practice, and the
proportion of that group that's been recognized is distressingly
small.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The college represents 100,000 doctors. Waxman said they have
been urged to look for signs of depression when patients visit, and
they have tried a number of different assessment tests. ``But they
need something that's simple and reliable that's suitable'' for the
brief time doctors have with patients in an outpatient setting. For
that reason, he said, the college was glad to join in with the
screening program.
</P>
<P>
   It's estimated that 17 million Americans suffer from depression
annually, but only half of them receive treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the signs of depression that the test targets are a loss
of pleasure, hope and interest, changes in sleeping and eating
patterns, trouble concentrating or making decisions, and thoughts
of suicide.

A `LEGACY' OF PROGRAMMING HISTORICAL FARE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEITH MARDER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Maybe it was a strategic move on the part of the
United Paramount Network.
</P>
<P>
   Four days after the debut of ``The Secret Diaries of Desmond
Pfeiffer,'' the farce of a comedy that has come under fire for its
depiction of the Civil War era, the network premieres its other
period piece, ``Legacy,'' set in post-Civil War Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   And this one _ so far _ doesn't go anywhere near controversial
issues such as slavery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Legacy,'' a beautiful video postcard with a melodic
Irish-music soundtrack, focuses on the Logan family, an earnest and
honest brood that traces its lineage back to County Cork, Ireland.
The first Logans stepped foot on U.S. soil in the late 1700s and
began a legacy of helping those less fortunate than themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Jeremy Bradford (Ron Melendez), a scheming, larcenous,
city-slicker orphan from New York City.
</P>
<P>
   This soap opera drama, which is an odd hybrid of ``Bonanza'' and
``Dallas,'' has enough conflict to keep it going awhile.
</P>
<P>
   But as is often the problem with large ensemble dramas, it's
sometimes hard to keep people straight. Sean (Grayson McCouch) and
Clay (Jeremy Garrett) Logan look so much alike, it's hard to
distinguish between the brothers.
</P>
<P>
   This good-looking show with a great-looking _ and sometimes
look-alike _ cast may be at times sappy and predictable, but it
could find an audience. However, it still seems an odd choice for
UPN, and an even odder choice to pair with ``The Love Boat: The
Next Wave,'' the network's only other Friday show.
</P>
<P>
   THE SHOW: ``Legacy.''
</P>
<P>
   WHAT: A family drama about a close-knit Irish brood in
post-Civil War Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   THE STARS: Brett Cullen, Grayson McCouch, Jeremy Garrett, Lea
Moreno, Sarah Rayne, Ron Melendez, Lisa Sheridan.
</P>
<P>
   WHERE: UPN (KCOP, Channel 13).
</P>
<P>
   WHEN: 8 p.m. Fridays.
</P>
<P>
   OUR RATING: 3 Stars.

   It's a bird. It's a plane. No, it's a television development
deal for a caped Internet heroine who flies to the rescue of broken
hearts and fractured relationships.
</P>
<P>
   Breakup Girl, the clever creation of Lynn Harris, 29, a
freelance writer and stand-up comedian, and Chris Kalb, 31, her
roommate-artist-friend, blazed onto the World Wide Web 10 months
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking through online dating advice columns, essays and a cute
and quirky comic strip, Breakup Girl (www.breakupgirl.com) has
become a star on the Net, drawing 45,000 visitors a month.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Morton, a former producer for David Letterman, said he
wanted to swell Breakup Girl's following to millions by making her
a star on a television network, starting with ABC. Morton's
company, Panamort Television, has a first-look arrangement with the
network.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years, movies and novels and other different media
influenced television,'' Morton said. ``As time has gone on, now
it's the Web.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Harris, who does a monthly live comedy club performance
based on her character, said plans were to create a 30-minute
situation comedy around the young woman who creates the Web site
and her cyberspace alter ego, Breakup Girl.
</P>
<P>
   ``What would be ultra cool is to show the internal tension by
toggling between the real character and the superhero,'' Ms. Harris
said.
</P>
<P>
   Hopes are to have a pilot ready by spring for network
consideration, said Morton, who noted that the show might combine
live action and animation.

   A New Electronic Paperback To Read on Planes and Trains
</P>
<P>
   The maker of a new electronic book is hoping it will become the
dog-eared paperback of the digital age. Weighing in at less than a
pound and costing under $200, the grandly named Millenium Reader,
scheduled for release this fall by Librius Inc. of Bellevue, Wash.,
will be lighter and less expensive than its current competitors.
Users will be able to go to the Librius storefront on the Internet,
browse the virtual shelves and download encrypted texts to the
Reader. The company estimates that each title will cost about 30
percent less than bound copies of the same text. The Reader can
hold up to 4,000 pages, and other purchases can be stored by the
user on the Librius server.
</P>
<P>
   Librius texts can also be downloaded to Windows CE and 3Com Palm
devices, but Librius still believes that an argument can be made
for the Reader. ``A Windows CE device can cost over $300,'' said
Don Bottoms, president of Librius. ``The Rocketbook (a competing
electronic book) costs $400. We think that for electronic books to
be accepted, they have to be less expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   There had been published reports that the company was focusing
on the romance novel market to jump-start sales, but Bottoms said
there was more to Librius than midnight trysts, heaving bosoms and
cleft-chinned heroes named Dag.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure we're in serious discussions with romance publishers,''
Bottoms said. ``We're in serious discussions with all kinds of
publishers.''
</P>
<P>
   The Librius database has 4,000 titles, Bottoms said, most of
them books in the public domain, but there are some serious
contemporary works, like Frank McCourt's ``Angela's Ashes.'' By the
launching date, the company hopes to have increased the databank to
10,000 titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you walk through an airplane, you see that people have
their office reading and their leisure reading, usually a
paperback,'' Bottoms said. ``That's the market we're after.''

   A Library Card for Techies From Macmillan's Web Site
</P>
<P>
   More than 200,000 people are taking advantage of full-text
computer books offered on line by the Macmillan Personal Bookshelf
(www.mcp.com/personal) to coach themselves through glitches or
explore new digital worlds, the company announced last week.
</P>
<P>
   Each subscriber is allowed access to up to five books at a time
from the 175 books available. But because subscribers can move
books on and off their list at will, that's not much of a
restriction.
</P>
<P>
   The books from Macmillan and other publishers range from a
Windows 98 tutorial to teach-yourself-programming guides and
advanced manuals. And at least one of the books teaches
self-defense: ``Maximum Security: A Hacker's Guide to Protecting
Your Internet Site and Network.'' That one's by Anonymous.

   A Computer Anti-Theft Alarm That Squeals Like a Stuck Pig
</P>
<P>
   Car alarms have become an annoying, if necessary, part of the
American soundscape, and a company wants computer alarms to join
the racket.
</P>
<P>
   The Bluvenom Anti-Theft Device, a computer security alarm made
of polycarbonate plastic, is locked to a desktop computer through
the floppy disk drive (the $70 model) or to a laptop through the
parallel port ($75). If the computer is moved after the device is
locked and set, Bluvenom will, in the words of the company's
co-founder, Gary Moser, ``squeal like a stuck pig.'' In fact,
Bluvenom will squeal a like stuck pig at 120 decibels, enough to
damage eardrums at close range, for seven hours or until the unit
is deactivated by a coded key.
</P>
<P>
   BluVenom has some advantages over car alarms. Users can adjust
the sensitivity to account for accidental bumps, and if the device
is jostled, it will emit a warning hiss.
</P>
<P>
   Moser hopes another feature will attract corporate clients. When
one alarm goes off, others within electronic earshot will go off in
sympathy, creating an entire roomful of 120-decibel stuck pigs.
Let's hope the car alarm industry doesn't hear about this.

   With New Disk Drive, Inventor Of Floppy Competes With Itself
</P>
<P>
   The inventor of the 3.5-inch floppy disk is joining the already
crowded battle to dislodge it as the removal computer storage
device of choice. This week, Sony and Fujifilm officially unveiled
HiFD, a floppy disk on steroids that holds about 140 times more
information than a conventional disk, and the HiFD disk drive.
</P>
<P>
   HiFD's capacity is double that of the popular Zip disk but well
below the 1 gigabyte offered by the Syquest Sparq drive which uses
a more costly, hard drive technology for its disks. ``We believe
that the HiFD has the capacity to be the next standard,'' said
Scott McNulty, Fuji's group product manager for computer products.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean that the two companies are turning their backs
on conventional floppies. Sony's new drive also works with the
old-style disks it introduced 12 years ago. Of its competitors,
only the 120-megabyte Imation Superdisk offers such dual service.
And, in a lapse of corporate synergy, there were two announced
prices for the disks: $14.99 for disks with the Sony label, $13.99
for Fuji. The drive, made by Sony, costs $199.
</P>
<P>
   Fuji is heavily promoting HiFD's theoretical ability to transfer
data about 2.5 times faster than a Zip drive. But the drive that
will be in stores by the end of next month will be an external
model that plugs only into computer printer ports, greatly limiting
its top speed. Users hoping to store time-sensitive materials such
as full motion videos on HiFD drives will have to wait for the
arrival of internal models.

   General Consumers Are Similar To Those Plugged Into Web
</P>
<P>
   It sometimes seems there are two parallel universes, one with
tech-savvy Netizens on the front lines of the digital revolution,
and one with plain old folks who think calculators, in-person
conversation and paper-based organizers work just fine. One new
study finds those universes are not as far apart as they appear.
</P>
<P>
   Interactive Solutions Group, a division of Market Facts Inc.,
finds that the general consumer population and Internet users
``mirror one another in most buying habits.''
</P>
<P>
   The study of 3,000 households found that when the group of
Internet users are controlled to reflect the demographics of the
general population, they report similar responses to questions
about lifestyle, travel, health issues and media habits.
Interactive Solutions Group, which researches buyer habits on the
Web, hopes the survey will demonstrate to major corporations that
they can rely on the validity of marketing surveys taken via the
Net.

BASEBALL, DOMINICAN RELIEF, MIX AT PRESS CONFERENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It didn't take long for the first baseball question to
come, even though Dan Duquette said the focus of Wednesday's Fenway
Park press conference was not about signing Mo Vaughn, acquiring
another big-name pitcher, or adding someone to hit behind Nomar
Garciaparra.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not here to talk about Mo, we're here to talk about
Joe,'' the Red Sox general manager said, referring to
Representative Joseph Kennedy. The congressman, Catholic Charities,
Pedro Martinez, and Red Sox chief executive officer John Harrington
have collaborated to help send supplies to the Dominican Republic
for victims of Hurricane Georges. The storm killed more than 200
people in the Dominican, left nearly a half-million homeless, and,
according to Catholic Relief Services, led to economic losses that
could exceed $3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, a Dominican from Manoguayabo, donated $100,000 through
his own foundation and pledged an additional $10,000 when he heard
of the Sox' involvement. Citizens Energy Corporation gave $10,000
to help local organizers ship 10 40-foot containers filled with
supplies from Lawrence, Hyde Park, and Worcester to the Dominican.
The Sox also donated $10,000. Kennedy's office estimates that it
will cost about $2,200 to send each container to the Dominican.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, known throughout the island for his philanthropy,
could not attend Wednesday's conference.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Sox are less than a week removed from their playoff
exit at the hands of the Indians, there were some inevitable
baseball comments and questions. Kennedy got a few laughs when he
said, ``I called up my Uncle Teddy and asked him if he wanted to
place a call to Sammy Sooser ... and I think he reached out to Mac
McGwire as well.'' Last month, Ted Kennedy badly mispronounced the
names of home run leaders Sammy Sosa and Mark McGwire at a
fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   Duquette, of course, also was asked about baseball. He said he
spends ``every waking moment'' thinking that the Sox could have
been in the American League Championship Series against the
Yankees. ``We were looking forward to Game 5: Pedro Martinez vs.
Jaret Wright. The Indians weren't looking forward to Game 5,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, he was asked about Mo rather than Joe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to make an effort to re-sign him, and hopefully,
he'll re-up with the Sox,'' he said of free agent Vaughn. Asked
when negotiations would begin, Duquette answered, ``Soon.''
</P>
<P>
   There were questions about third base coach Wendell Kim's
decision to send John Valentin home during a key Game 4 play.
Valentin was thrown out at the plate by outfielder David Justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed to score runs to win that ballgame, and it was a
reasonable gamble _ the bottom part of our order hadn't produced
the whole series, and that's what was coming up,'' Duquette said.
``So Wendell Kim made his best judgment to send Valentin and
Valentin made his best effort to score.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For Hispanics, the long march to political power
began shortly after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Like many Americans, tens of thousands of Hispanics who joined
the military found that the war had forever changed their outlook.
Sent to bases across the country and overseas, they saw a world
outside their barrios in the Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time, they were able to see how people lived and
were treated outside of California and Texas,'' says John Garcia,
an expert on Hispanic politics at the University of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   In those days Mexican Americans in Texas could not serve on
grand juries or draft boards, and most attended de facto segregated
schools. Many were refused service in restaurants, and few voted
because of a poll tax. In California, they found segregation _
except in housing _ less widespread, but discrimination was
rampant. ``Pachuco'' was a common epithet that they heard. It was
the equivalent of ``nigger'' or ``wop.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, thousands of Hispanic veterans took advantage of the G.I.
Bill and went to college, forming the nucleus of a small
professional class. Self-help groups sprang up. One was the
Community Service Organization (CSO), founded in 1947 in Los
Angeles to fight discrimination in the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   CSO quickly became involved in local politics. For example, it
conducted a strong voter registration drive that was key to the
election of Edward R. Roybal to the Los Angeles City Council in
1949. He was the first Mexican American elected to the council in
the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in Texas a physician named Hector Garcia and other
veterans in Corpus Christi had started the American GI Forum to
protect the rights of Mexican-American veterans.
</P>
<P>
   An incident in the town of Three Rivers, 65 miles northwest of
Corpus Christi, outraged Garcia and led him to launch a national
campaign against discrimination. Through his efforts, media from
around the country focused on Three Rivers, where a funeral home
director had refused to let the family of a deceased Army private,
Felix Longoria, hold a wake because he was Hispanic. As a result of
the publicity, Longoria was buried with honor in Arlington National
Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican Americans, although shunned by Democratic and Republican
party bosses, continued to run for office during the 1950s. But
with little money, most of their campaigns failed.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the decade, some Hispanic leaders recognized that
their candidates needed more help from their own communities if
they were to succeed. So in 1959, 150 activists gathered in Los
Angeles and founded the Mexican American Political Association.
MAPA, which later established branches throughout the Southwest,
sought to get Mexican-American candidates from either party
elected.
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1960 the Viva Kennedy campaign began.
</P>
<P>
   Realizing that the election between Democrat John Kennedy and
Republican Richard Nixon was going to be close, Kennedy aides
fanned out in the Southwest setting up Viva Kennedy clubs to bring
out the Hispanic vote.
</P>
<P>
   On election day, these voters proved crucial to Kennedy's
victory in Texas. Some precincts in El Paso, for instance, went 100
percent for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the Anglo vote split fairly evenly in Texas, the Latino
vote carried the day for Kennedy,'' says Louis DeSipio of the
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, an expert on Hispanic
political movements.
</P>
<P>
   The next year Henry B. Gonzalez of San Antonio won a special
election to become the first Hispanic congressman in modern times.
In 1962 Roybal won a U.S. House seat from Los Angeles. The Senate
already had Dennis Chavez of New Mexico, who served from from 1935
to 1964, when he stepped down and was replaced by Joseph Montoya.
</P>
<P>
   While some Mexican Americans celebrated these victories, others,
particularly young people, charged that both the Democratic and
Republican parties were still refusing to back Hispanics
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The young activists tried a more confrontational approach. Some
pointed to the federal funds given to African Americans following
riots in black neighborhoods during the 1960s and argued that
Hispanics needed to use similar methods to attract national
attention and government aid.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most important groups formed in that period was La
Crusada Para La Justicia. Started in Denver in 1965 by Rodolfo
``Corky'' Gonzales, a poet and former boxing champion, the group
supported high school strikes, organized demonstrations against
police brutality and protested against the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   Many non-Hispanic whites saw Gonzales' organization as a
dangerous threat to society, but some militant Hispanics felt it
didn't go far enough.
</P>
<P>
   In 1967, Reies Tijerina and about 40 armed supporters took
control of the Rio Arriba County courthouse in the northern New
Mexico town of Tierra Amarilla. Tijerina released 11 prisoners who
had been arrested in connection with his plan to take over lands in
the Kit Carson National Forest.
</P>
<P>
   After a shootout with police, Tijerina and his supporters fled
into nearby mountains. Eventually, the National Guard captured him
and 17 of his supporters. He was later acquitted of the charges
resulting from the raid.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic militancy also was showing up in the political arena. In
1970, Jose Angel Gutierrez and other activists at St. Mary's
University in San Antonio founded a third party called La Raza
Unida. It sought to gain political control of Texas communities
with significant Mexican-American majorities.
</P>
<P>
   The LRU, which called for instruction in Spanish in all American
schools and increased government aid for the poor, found its
greatest success in Crystal City, about 100 miles southwest of San
Antonio. There, the party's candidates won control of the city
council and board of education in 1970. The LRU also managed to get
candidates elected in 22 Texas counties that year. Two years later,
an LRU candidate, Ramsey Muniz, ran for governor but won only about
6 percent of the vote.

   The curtain rises Thursday at the Mark Taper Forum in Los
Angeles on previews of a version of Stephen Sondheim's revue
``Putting It Together,'' with Carol Burnett, Bronson Pinchot, Susan
Egan, John McCook and John Barrowman. Sondheim has revised the
show, which attracted a mixed reception in 1993 at the Manhattan
Theater Club. New songs drawn from the Sondheim canon have been put
in and others have been taken out in altering this show about
relationships for audiences in Los Angeles. The piece is also being
tailored to Ms. Burnett's dramatic abilities as well as her musical
and comedic talents. The official opening will be on Oct. 25, and
the run has been extended for a week through Dec. 6. Ticket sales
are the best in the Taper's 31-year history.

   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Celebrating its 50th anniversary, the
Frankfurt Book Fair opened Wednesday amid undertones of political
controversy and expectations of attracting 300,000 visitors to see
the wares of 6,500 exhibitors from 105 countries. Ayse Nur
Zarakolu, a Turkish author, was expected Thursday after Turkish
officials lifted a ban preventing her from traveling to Germany to
accept the $6,000 prize accompanying the new International Freedom
to Publish Award. She served nearly 16 months in prison for
publishing books on the conflict with Kurdish rebels and human
rights violations in Turkey. The British author Salman Rushdie put
in an appearance. Other authors participating include Ken Follett
and Patricia Cornwell.

   NEW YORK _ Armor worn by Renaissance kings and captains, who
hoped to project an aura of power and virtue by arraying themselves
like the heroes of Roman history and mythology, goes on display
Thursday at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The exhibition is
billed as the first comprehensive survey of the classically
inspired parade armor created by Filippo Negroli, the most
celebrated Italian armorer of the 16th century, and his
contemporaries in Milan, Mantua and Brescia. The show, ``Heroic
Armor of the Italian Renaissance: Filippo Negroli and His
Contemporaries,'' features more than 60 works, including the
personal harnesses of the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, Henry VII
of France and the dukes of Urbino. The exhibition continues through
Jan. 17.

   PARIS _ Vandals have stolen the head of a statue at Notre Dame
Cathedral in Paris and damaged five others. According to the French
Culture Ministry, the damage was not immediately discovered because
the western face of the Gothic cathedral, where the statues stand,
has been shrouded in scaffolding during a restoration. The head was
taken from a 13th-century statue, and the damaged statues date from
the 12th, 13th and 19th centuries. The case is being investigated
by police units that deal with gang activity and the theft of
cultural treasures.  &QL;

SERIAL SLEUTHS, SPREADING GLEE 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk)

<P>
   Few things bring a merry heart to a fiction publisher quicker
than the coming of a character who will endure in novel after novel
and, if truly lucky, in movie after movie. Most such characters are
in murder inventions or other thrillers, usually noir. But
sometimes they perpetuate and flourish in adventure make-believes.
</P>
<P>
   Often their creators turn out a novel every 15 months or so. For
the lucky publisher and the addicted reader, when the new book
comes out in hardcover, the previous one hits in paperback.
Publishing bliss.
</P>
<P>
   The meticulously logical and thoroughly implausible Sherlock
Holmes was the first internationally famous serial private eye, and
the idea of following one detective from tale to tale spread all
over the English landscape, often with tweedy older ladies as
detectives. The genre exploded more robustly in the United States
with Raymond Chandler's Philip Marlowe, moralist, avenger, tough
guy. The stories went from appealing to the puzzle-solvers to
becoming morality tales. They didn't need much logic. When
Chandler's great ``Big Sleep'' was made into the Bogart-Bacall
movie, the director, Howard Hawks, couldn't figure out who had
murdered a character. He asked Chandler and the novelist told him
he didn't know either. The genre is about character, not plot. You
care about Marlowe, not the story.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, American novelists have created a yeasty muster of
private investigators and other enduring apprehenders of evildoers.
Fans now are not only fascinated by the murder cases these
characters have solved but also enjoy chewing over the psyches and
the familial details of such as Spenser, Dr. Kay Scarpetta, Sgt.
Lloyd Hopkins, the National Park Service Ranger Anna Pigeon and
that great Moscow chief investigator, ``Gorky Park's'' Arkady
Renko, to name but a few.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, continuity and familiar characters account in part for
the popularity of the ``Star Wars'' and ``Star Trek'' series and of
Patrick O'Brian's cracking good Aubrey-Maturin sea stories. Irywn
Applebaum, president and publisher of Bantam Books, said of these
series books that the reader pleasure was so great ``because it's
like going to a family reunion without having to bring your own
stories.''
</P>
<P>
   ``With the good writers,'' he said, ``the character's
psychological growth doesn't get in the way of the story; in fact,
you're more interested in what's going on in Spenser's life or Kay
Scarpetta's life than anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   The author's kinship is often quite different. Robert B. Parker,
author of the Spenser novels (Putnam), said that Spenser ``is less
real to me than to readers,'' adding: ``I know more than anyone
that he's created, made up. I don't throw him into the open page
and let him lead me along. Some writers say that because they have
nothing else to say.'' Spenser is in his early 60s and ``has my
memories.'' The private investigator has a long life ahead, Parker
said, but the writer has developed a younger serial character,
Jesse Stone, 35, subject of two novels, and is writing a novel
about a woman who is a private investigator, Sunny Randall, who
will be played by Helen Hunt in the done-deal movie.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Cruz Smith, on the other hand, has real affection for
Arkady Renko, his Moscow detective, who is now en route to Havana
for his fourth appearance in a (Random House) novel. Smith
alternates between Renko and other stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``Renko's a strong enough character to withstand my
personality,'' Smith said. ``He's bright and a great guy to work
with because you sense he's not finished yet. He's done a lot of
maturing and is still maturing, but you can't entirely control
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Gritty women are popular sleuths, not surprisingly since women
buy most books. Besides Patricia Cornwell's Scarpetta, Putnam has a
series by Nevada Barr starring Anna Pigeon, a forest ranger
detective. Ms. Barr, a former ranger, said that she channels her
own feelings through Pigeon, whom she allows to ``get older and
learn because if she doesn't, then pretty soon you're just moving
paper dolls.''
</P>
<P>
   A master of the genre and one of the most interesting and
probably ego-driven novelists around is James Ellroy. His ``L.A.
Confidential'' (Mysterious Press, 1990) became an acclaimed movie.
</P>
<P>
   Ellroy ended his serial policeman, the unlikable Sgt. Lloyd
Hopkins, after three books that were republished recently in one
volume titled ``L.A. Noir'' (Mysterious Press). ``I didn't care
whether my readers liked Lloyd Hopkins as long as they liked the
books he was in,'' Ellroy has said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I just want to write bigger, richer, larger, deeper books,
20th-century historical novels,'' is the way Ellroy explains the
disappearance of Hopkins. Still, characters from ``American
Tabloid,'' a historical novel depicting the underbelly of the
Kennedy era, will reappear in two sequels.
</P>
<P>
   As Ellroy more or less jumps out, novelist Dean Koontz is
leaping in with a night-prowling serial character named Christopher
Snow, who will make his second appearance for Bantam late in
December. There's no mystery why. But publishing does have its
inscrutables, particularly in this esoteric genre.
</P>
<P>
   What is the masters' master up to? Ellroy has called Thomas
Harris' ``Red Dragon'' (Putnam) the ``greatest suspense novel ever
written.'' In it, he introduced a brilliant FBI tracker of serial
killers, Will Graham. Harris was able to do what great writers do:
psychologically inhabit Graham in the same way that the fictional
Graham was able to inhabit the serial killer he was hunting.
</P>
<P>
   A character who made a slight, almost cameo, appearance in ``The
Red Dragon'' was the brilliant psychopath Dr. Hannibal Lecter.
</P>
<P>
   Graham, a very appealing character indeed, did not make it into
Harris' next novel, ``The Silence of the Lambs'' (St. Martin's
Press). But Hannibal Lecter certainly did. Somewhere the reclusive
Harris is busy writing another novel, this one for Delacorte. It is
said he is once again inhabiting Hannibal Lecter.

`SEEING AND BELIEVING': THE HEAVENS CAME TUMBLING TO EARTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Publication notes at end of review.)  
(lb) 
 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Among the many pleasures of Richard Panek's elegant new book,
``Seeing and Believing: How the Telescope Opened Our Eyes and Minds
to the Heavens,'' is its epigraph by John Cheever: ``The children
have built something out of an orange crate, something preposterous
and ascendant. ...''
</P>
<P>
   This poetically captures the technical side of Panek's story,
the children being mankind, the orange crate being the telescope,
and the ``something preposterous and ascendant'' being audacious
new theories about the universe that time and again defied what
passed for common sense.
</P>
<P>
   Panek's story begins, of course, with Galileo in November 1609,
improving a rumored novelty involving the correct alignment of two
lenses in a leaden tube and his use of it to discover other planets
in our solar system. From here the author traces the technical
progress of the telescope through lengthening, the addition of a
magnifying eye piece and the placement of measuring devices within.
</P>
<P>
   A crucial discovery along the way was that observing the heavens
had less to do with magnification than with the gathering of light,
and this led to the use of telescopes with mirrors, photography and
spectroscopy or the passing of telescoped light through a prism to
analyze its sources.
</P>
<P>
   Only with the development of the radio telescope was it
discovered that ``visible light covered only 2 percent of the
electromagnetic spectrum,'' Panek writes. But with the coming of
the computer and the space satellite, astronomers could drill a
``hole ... through the heavens,'' as Panek puts it.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1995, the Hubble Space Telescope revealed that the
universe comprised not 10 billion galaxies, as had been previously
thought, but some 50 billion.
</P>
<P>
   All this amazing technical evolution is described here with
clarity and ease. Panek is a freelance reporter, an award-winning
short-story writer and the author of ``Waterloo Diamonds,'' a
social history of an Iowa community told through its baseball
fortunes. He writes about science with practiced fluency. If you
haven't yet gotten matter like quasars, pulsars and gamma rays
entirely straight in your mind, this book will prove invaluable.
</P>
<P>
   But what makes ``Seeing and Believing'' most unusual is the way
Panek treats the implications of his history, the way he shows how
the telescope's development moved in advance of mankind's
understanding. To convey this as vividly as he does requires a
skill just as demanding as the ability to explain new developments,
namely a capacity to imagine and make clear how people saw things
in the past.
</P>
<P>
   The metaphor he uses to describe how the telescope affected
human consciousness begins with the discovery of perspective in
Italian Renaissance art, which served to eliminate what he calls
``the sacred backdrop of old, the golden or black curtain against
which saints and Savior had enacted their symbol-drenched dramas.''
</P>
<P>
   He continues: ``The uniform backdrop of old was a presence that
didn't fully reveal itself until it was absent. Only then did it
yield its secrets: how it had represented an unwavering, unthinking
assumption; how its uniform surface of gold or black provided a
sensibility unto itself; how that sensibility reflected a singular
point of view, saints of a certain size, Virgin of another, Jesus
of a third, all arrayed according to a hierarchy that could belong
only to the mind of God. But now it was gone, and what replaced it
was a point of view that could belong only to the human eye _ and
only to an eye seeing the world as if for the first time.''
</P>
<P>
   Two centuries later, with Galileo's use of the telescope in
1609, ``man had completed the intellectual journey he had begun''
with ``the introduction of perspective into art,'' Panek continues.
The sacred backdrop had become a curtain to be opened, and ``man
had gone from being the apple of God's eye to being God's eye.''
</P>
<P>
   With similar verve, ``Seeing and Believing'' describes the shock
of all the revolutions created by the telescope. As Panek sums up:
``The flatness of Earth, the immobility of the globe, the perfectly
circular paths of the planets, the earth's position at the center
of the Kosmos, the sun's position at the center of a new cosmos,
the fixed positions of the stars, the stars themselves as the
extent of the universe, the universe as all that we could ever hope
to see, and all we could ever hope to see as all there is _ all the
assumptions safely based on observation were gone.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the tool that swept these assumptions away: ``Now, in the
aftermath of the New Astronomy of invisible light, to say nothing
of the dark matter revolution, it turned out that the instrument in
any incarnation came with its own inherent set of limitations, not
on what to expect or where to look, but on how to look, not on the
available information, but on the nature of the information
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the children have built something out of an orange crate,
something preposterous and ascendant. And Panek has shown how those
who built ascendant things kept falling down, only to discover that
the place they had fallen down to was wonderfully different and
very strange.
</P>
<P>
   As he himself sums up the case he has so persuasively made in
``Seeing and Believing,'' ``The relationship between the telescope
and our understanding of the dimensions of the universe is in many
ways the story of modernity.''

THE BYWAYS NOT TAKEN ON OLD BEETHOVEN ROAD  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 11) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By PAUL GRIFFITHS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Playing Beethoven is one of the two most important things a
symphony orchestra has to do, along with performing new works. We
need to keep going back to Beethoven. And we need to keep thinking
about why we need to keep going back.
</P>
<P>
   Opportunities to go back, but not so much to think about why,
were recently offered by the New York Philharmonic and its music
director, Kurt Masur. Their season-opening Beethoven cycle was,
remarkably, the Philharmonic's first compact presentation of the
Beethoven symphonies since Toscanini conducted the works in the
orchestra's centenary year, 1942.
</P>
<P>
   A lot has happened since 1942. Increased knowledge of
Beethoven's contemporaries has enhanced our awareness both of how
far he stood apart and of how close he was to other composers of
his age in his Romantic urgings and his revolutionary hopes.
</P>
<P>
   As Masur remarked in an interview printed in the program book
for these concerts, Beethoven ``knew the works of the French
composers of that time very well'' and ``even quotes a march by the
French revolutionary composer Gossec'' in the finale of the Seventh
Symphony. Other relationships could have been cited, along with
ways in which Beethoven was alone: alone, for example, in how
decisively he brought motivic development, harmonic movement,
rhythmic force and dynamic emphasis together to execute an ideal of
progress that made the French composer's music sound just well
intentioned.
</P>
<P>
   Another change in the musical world since 1942 has been the
enormous growth in understanding how Beethoven's music was played
when it was new. Yet another, reflected especially in critical
writing of the last decade or so, has been the revelation that
Beethoven's pinnacle position in classical music was a product not
just of solitary genius but also of a process going on in his
society.
</P>
<P>
   With new forms of communication _ printed music, open concerts,
the parlor piano, music criticism _ the new and broader musical
public needed to have not only the classics but a great composer it
could acclaim as its own. Beethoven was at hand. By 1842, when the
Philharmonic played his Fifth Symphony at the start of its first
concert, he was firmly established at the center of another
innovation of the time: the orchestral repertory.
</P>
<P>
   Justly so, we might say. But we might not want simply to accept
an estimation of Beethoven created in the early 19th century. Hence
the urge to get back to the source material, whether by imitating,
more or less, the performance practices of Beethoven's time or by
trying to comprehend his music in the context of other music of his
age, by Gossec and the rest.
</P>
<P>
   We need not suppose that by such means we could ever hear
Beethoven truly afresh. Nor is it likely that his music will come
to seem any less extraordinary and important. But at least we might
start, in some small way, making our own decisions.
</P>
<P>
   The Philharmonic declined these avenues to a rehearing of
Beethoven. Instead of programming the symphonies alongside other
works that could have made us consider their musical progenitors
and environments, the orchestra left them as independent, mighty
mountains. And little had been learned from all the research into
the scale of Beethoven's orchestras or the way instruments of his
period spoke.
</P>
<P>
   Masur used the new Peters editions, and his tempos for scherzos
and finales were often fast, in the spirit of Beethoven's metronome
markings (at least at the performances I heard, of the First,
Fourth and Fifth Symphonies). But the players showed no evidence of
trying to adapt to early-19th-century requirements, and the
orchestra was big and overbalanced in favor of the string section.
</P>
<P>
   In the last movement of the Fifth, for instance, the piccolo
sounded like a caged bird, battering its wings against the bars of
the 60 strings.
</P>
<P>
   Another item in the program book disclosed that Masur, during
his 26 years as Kapellmeister of the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra,
included Beethoven in 63 percent of his subscription evenings and
gave, astonishingly, 111 performances of the Seventh Symphony: one
every three months, every ninth concert.
</P>
<P>
   Experience tells. Masur knows how this music works and how to
convey its vigorous gestures. The stirring motions he makes with
his left arm, and the sways, shakes and shudders in his body all
confirm his close involvement in the moment-to-moment noise and
urgency of the music, even if the shape of the whole movement, the
whole symphony, is not being so strongly communicated.
</P>
<P>
   Part of his problem at these concerts was that the orchestra did
not seem very interested in what was going on. Where Masur was
projecting compulsion and excitement, from the musicians came bald,
unfeeling playing, coarse tone and loose entries.
</P>
<P>
   But part of the problem, too, is the loss of faith we may feel
in a traditional approach, with a scale and style of playing that
have come down by tradition, offered in programs that just
reinforce a traditional sense of Beethoven's greatness.
</P>
<P>
   Under such circumstances it might have been hard even for Masur,
even with an orchestra fully engaged, to make us hear the music
again and not merely be reminded of it.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the hall was full and the crowd enthusiastic. After all, to
be reminded of Beethoven is not such a bad thing. But the
Philharmonic's next Beethoven cycle _ which, let us hope, will come
before 56 years have passed _ will have some work to do.

 NATIONAL BALLET OF CANADA: CLASSICAL YET LOOSER, A TROUPE RENEWED 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ANNA KISSELGOFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Choreography, genuine and unusual, is on view this
week at City Center, where the National Ballet of Canada opened on
Tuesday night for its first visit to New York in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   The company, now directed by the the choreographer James
Kudelka, looks totally transformed. With this splendid program
(there are two other bills), the troupe from Toronto comes to the
fore on the international dance scene as a first-class creative
organization. It may not have rejected the standard repertory of
its past, but that repertory is apparently no longer its focus.
</P>
<P>
   The four works on view, two by Kudelka, one by John Alleyne and
one by Dominique Dumais, who is both a female soloist in the
company and its rising choreographic talent, were all New York
premieres. All are plotless but not devoid of emotion, and in one
the dancers jump around in overcoats. All gave the dancers a
high-octane technical workout and provided the audience with some
surprises.
</P>
<P>
   There is a new look. If there was any hallmark of the National
Ballet style, it was the academic correctness of its training. But
Kudelka has loosened the company up: the dancers, both old and new,
are more daring, fluent and energetic and articulate. The high leg
extensions and arrow-sharp leaps are exhilarating to watch, and yet
the attention to classical ballet's body placement and line is
still present.
</P>
<P>
   And since much of Kudelka's own concerns as a choreographer have
to do with new ways of partnering, his two ballets, ``Musings'' and
``The Four Seasons,'' are largely explorations of the ways two or
even three and four dancers remain connected as they perform.
</P>
<P>
   Kudelka is no stranger to New York, where his works have also
been seen with the Joffrey Ballet, the San Francisco Ballet, Margie
Gillis' dance troupe and American Ballet Theater. At his best, as
with Ballet Theater's ``Cruel World,'' he can tantalize with the
mysteries of his images and also excite an audience with the
passionate outpouring of his choreography.
</P>
<P>
   Part of ``Musings,'' created in 1991 for the former National
Ballet star Karen Kain, is one of Kudelka's quieter (and longer)
works and is set to Mozart's Quintet for Clarinet and Strings,
which was played onstage by Max Christie, clarinet, and, on
strings, by Fujiko Imajishi, Dominique Laplante, Angela Ruddetn and
Maurizio Baccante.
</P>
<P>
   Like the music, the choreography has its intricacies beneath its
lyrical surface. The piece starts well. Three men in 18th-century
dress (Aleksandar Antonijevic, Johan Persson and Jeremy Ransom)
enter consecutively and move in swift airborne turns around Jaimie
Tapper, who is wearing a blue velvet bodice and a long skirt. The
other women in the cast wear the same costume by Astrid Janson but
in different hues, and the men look gallant and gentlemanly. When
Jennifer Fournier, in red, appears as the pensive figure of the
piece, she is followed by the three men, who mysteriously bend an
arm to shield their faces. She is their guide and weeps.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tapper, Rebekah Rimsay and Stacey Shiori Minagawa gambol
through the lively minuet section before a series of solos (Ms.
Rimsay has some startling and violent torso rotations) and duets
give the spectacular dancing the showcase it deserves.
</P>
<P>
   In Vivaldi's ``Four Seasons,'' conducted by Ormsby Wilkins,
Kudelka turns the usual allegory about the seasons into an
everyman's self-analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Rex Harrington, as strongly concentrated a performer as ever, is
his moody self looking past the long-legged leaping brides, led by
Chan Hon Goh, in the spring section. Carmen Alie and Denis Lavoie
have designed nicely fantastical costumes. Greta Hodgkinson and
Martine Lamy lead, respectively, the summer and autumn sections.
Each segment experiments with Kudelka's interest in loose torsos
and quick footwork. The punch line is the appearance of older
character dancers in the winter section after Harrington is
importuned by a jumping pest, Ransom.
</P>
<P>
   There is a Shakespearean tinge to this modern-dress older group,
led by Victoria Bertram, the mother who cradles Harrington at the
end.
</P>
<P>
   Alleyne, whose ballets have also been seen here at the New York
City Ballet and in his company, Ballet British Columbia, has
perfected his view of neo-classicism in ``Split House Geometric.''
</P>
<P>
   Aggressive attack and wiry entanglements defined a duet for
Stephanie Hutchison and Christopher Body, and was contrasted with a
longer, yanking duet for the riveting Ms. Tapper and Anthony
Randazzo.
</P>
<P>
   The music, on tape, was by Arvo Part.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Tides of Mind,'' Ms. Dumais used a tape of Dawn Upshaw, who
sang the second movement of Gorecki's Third Symphony.
</P>
<P>
   The choreography for Ms. Lamy and Persson, looking back perhaps
to a paradise lost, was impressive in its intensity and clarity.
One looks forward to her next premiere on the second program.

CLINTON'S WISE MEN HAVE ARRIVED 
</HEADLINE>
  By DAVID PLOTZ 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   They have arrived. Not from the Orient, but from the Palm. Drawn
not by a star, but by a Starr. Bearing not holy gifts, but
unsolicited advice.
</P>
<P>
   The Wise Men are everywhere, again. Former White House Counsel
Lloyd Cutler, ``counselor to presidents,'' is trying to broker a
censure compromise to prevent impeachment. He, in turn, is aided by
two eminences-in-training: former Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell and former White House Chief of Staff Leon Panetta. Former
Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach and former White House Counsel
Abner Mikva have joined them in opposition to impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Former President Gerald Ford proposed his remedy _ a
congressional rebuke _ in Sunday's New York Times. Former
presidential candidate Bob Dole and former Sen. Howard Baker have
suggested they would serve as intermediaries to the GOP if the
country demanded it.
</P>
<P>
   (Ford and Dole! Maybe they could join forces with Ross Perot,
who is flacking a resignation petition. The three could tour
together: ``America's Worst Presidential Candidates Advise the
President.'')
</P>
<P>
   Washington is supposed to be honored that all these Formers
would take time off from their day jobs (influence-peddling and
long lunches) to weigh in on Flytrap. The Wise Men, after all, are
our political elders. They have gravitas and worthy principles such
as ``nonpartisanship'' and ``preserving the dignity of the
presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   But Washington, I am saddened to report, does not care. The
Republican impeachment steamroller has flattened the Wise Men.
Cutler's effort to gather congressional support for censure is
``dead on arrival,'' says one Democratic House Judiciary Committee
staffer. So is Ford's proposed rebuke. Dole has retreated, saying
that there can be no agreement before the election. Democrats cling
to the Wise Men, but congressional Republicans aren't bothering
with the pleas of a few old-timers. (What, after all, do
Republicans owe Dole, who drowned them in 1996?)
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Wise Men's acolytes believe their time may still
come. After the election, when Republicans realize the folly of
impeachment, they may well turn to the Wise Men to forge a
sufficiently punitive compromise.
</P>
<P>
   The indifference that has greeted the Wise Men so far has
prompted a great outpouring of nostalgic hoo-ha. Former
Something-or-Other Robert Strauss (``Mr. Democrat'') commented
mournfully in the Wall Street Journal about the degradation of the
polis.
</P>
<P>
   In the good old days, Strauss averred, the public never would
have heard about Flytrap. It would have been hushed up by Strauss
and his cronies, and a good thing too! The New York Times, too,
mourned the decline of Sage Culture in a recent ``Week in Review''
piece.
</P>
<P>
   The underlying sentiment of the hoo-ha seems to be: Wouldn't
everything be better if Cutler, Newt Gingrich, Trent Lott, and
Erskine Bowles sat down at the Metropolitan Club, shared a few
drinks, settled everything like gentlemen, and got back to work?
</P>
<P>
   Well, not necessarily. I'm all for a Flytrap compromise _ even
one brokered by Washington elders _ and I suppose Cutler was a
</P>
<P>
   (slightly) better presidential adviser than Harry Thomason. But
the decline of the Wise Men was both inevitable and desirable.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the rise of cable news television and aggressive
investigative journalism, there is no behind-the-scenes anymore:
The backroom deals the Wise Men depended on are nearly impossible
today. Journalists don't cooperate in suppressing unsightly news.
The decay of party discipline crippled the Wise Men: They needed
strong political parties to enforce the deals they struck with
congressional leaders. Today's Congress is too chaotic.
</P>
<P>
   And the Wise Men don't fully deserve their romantic reputation.
As Evan Thomas, co-author of The Wise Men, notes, the Wise Men of
the '50s and '60s didn't compile a perfect record. They let
McCarthyism flourish, tolerated J. Edgar Hoover, and pushed a
disastrous Vietnam policy. They kept the press quiescent and
cooperative, allowing corruption and insider-dealing that would
never be tolerated today. Wise Man politics is elitism of the worst
sort: It distrusts democracy, so it circumvents it.

SUDDENLY MODERATION LOOKS GOOD 
</HEADLINE>
  By WILLIAM SALETAN 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week, ``a source'' told the Washington Post that Paula
Jones' lawyers were blowing their chance at a settlement of their
case. According to the source, President Clinton ``was enraged'' at
the Jones team for spinning the settlement as an admission of
guilt. ``You cannot underestimate the personal feelings about
this,'' the source said. ``They've just really overplayed their
hand.''
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, ``Democratic sources'' told the Post that Senate
Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., had ``discouraged'' an effort,
brought to his attention by Clinton, to head off an impeachment
inquiry altogether. Despite the ``intensive behind-the-scenes
lobbying Clinton is doing,'' the Post reported, the ``skepticism of
Daschle and other Democrats'' shows that they ``are placing clear
limits on what they will do to short-circuit the constitutional
process.'' ``White House and House Democratic sources made clear''
to the Post ``that what the administration wants has little effect
on how the Democrats shape their strategy.'' A source said House
Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., ``has made it clear that
nobody falls on his sword for Bill Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Methinks the Democrats doth protest too much. In the impeachment
proceedings, as in the Jones case, Clinton is staking out an
extreme position in order to facilitate a deal in the middle. The
more he ``lobbies'' for acquittal while letting it be known that
Democrats are rejecting his entreaties, the more moderate and
reasonable the Democrats look, even as they obstruct and trash the
Republican-led inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, when Republicans took over Congress, Clinton and
his new adviser, Dick Morris, embarked on a strategy called
``triangulation.'' According to this strategy, Clinton would stake
out a position between congressional Democrats and Republicans. By
rejecting the Democrats' views as too liberal, Clinton would help
himself look moderate, even as he obstructed and trashed the
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   But now that Clinton has become a paragon of the moral laxity
many Americans (rightly or wrongly) associate with liberalism, he's
triangulating in reverse. He's helping the Democrats earn the
credibility necessary to keep their jobs in the upcoming election,
without taking away his job.
</P>
<P>
   The reverse triangulation is working brilliantly. On ABC's
``This Week,'' Cokie Roberts asked Gephardt about Clinton adviser
James Carville's recent declaration of war on House Speaker Newt
Gingrich. ``It's a free country,'' Gephardt answered, but ``we've
got to all take a deep breath (and) stop personal attacks back and
forth.'' George Will brought up the proposal ``by supporters of the
president'' to head off the impeachment inquiry altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that is the way to do this,'' said Gephardt.
Roberts said that ``White House lobbying ... seems to be ticking
off the members of Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Sam Donaldson said that ``a lot of Democrats on the Hill ... are
very upset the president and Mrs. Clinton (are) trying to make this
a party-line vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in a buried newspaper quote, an anonymous Clinton
adviser hinted at the real strategy: ``Our focus is still on the
(impeachment) resolution and the Democratic alternative and how we
can build on it.''
</P>
<P>
   In schools where corporal punishment is still administered, kids
who misbehave are sometimes offered a choice of punishments: They
can be spanked, or they can spend several afternoons in
after-school detention. Detention is painless but prolonged.
Spanking is humiliating but over in a few seconds. Kids who are
both tough and smart choose spanking. You can bet Bill Clinton was
that kind of kid.

THE AFFIRMATIVE ACTION WARS, PART 37 
</HEADLINE>
  By JUDITH SHULEVITZ 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The backlash against William G. Bowen and Derek Bok's ``The
Shape of the River,'' a liberal defense of affirmative action, has
kicked into gear, and much of it won't surprise you.
</P>
<P>
   There's the attacker: Abigail Thernstrom, co-author (with her
husband Stephan) of ``America in Black and White: One Nation,
Indivisible'' and one of the loudest opponents of affirmative
action around.
</P>
<P>
   There's the old juggle-with-numbers. Is a 75 percent graduation
rate for blacks at top colleges proof of the success of
race-sensitive admissions or of its failure?
</P>
<P>
   Proof of success, according to Bowen and Bok; proof of failure,
according to Thernstrom. The white graduation rate is 86 percent,
so she reconfigures the stats to show that blacks have a dropout
rate that's 78 percent higher for blacks than for whites.
</P>
<P>
   But Thernstom's main argument is original. She says an education
at an elite college doesn't matter as much as everyone says it
does, so elite colleges shouldn't work so hard to admit more
blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Bowen and Bok claim we need affirmative action from top schools
because that's what created the black middle class in the first
place? Not so fast! says Thernstrom: ``Where are their control
groups, demonstrating in some rigorous fashion that the equally
academically strong, ambitious and discipline black student who
attends the University of South Carolina instead of Oberlin does
less well in life?''
</P>
<P>
   Lacking hard data, Thernstrom supplies anecdotal evidence: a
list of blacks who did well in life even though they didn't go to
Princeton or Penn. It includes Cynthia Tucker, editorial writer at
the Atlanta Constitution, who went to Auburn University; Clarence
Page, a columnist for the Chicago Tribune, who went to Ohio; Brent
Staples of the New York Times, who went to Widener, Vernon Jordan,
who went to Depauw; and so on.
</P>
<P>
   We are charmed by a certain self-inverting quality to
Thernstrom's argument. If like her we believe in strict formal
equality in all things (rather than remedies to past
discrimination), and black people don't need fancy schools to do
well in life, why should we think white people need them either?
</P>
<P>
   Think of the current master of the universe, Disney chief
Michael Eisner, who graduated from Denison, a university in
Granville, Ohio. Or Steven Spielberg, who never graduated at all.
</P>
<P>
   But if white people don't need degrees from tony colleges to
succeed, why do Thernstrom and her cohorts care so much about these
schools' efforts to level the playing field? The better strategy
would be to cede it altogether, leaving blacks to enjoy their
Pyrric victory. More fools they, that they believe in the power of
a Harvard education!
</P>
<P>
   Thernstrom sent her daughter, Melanie Thernstrom, to Harvard, so
we know she doesn't accept the unintended consequences of her own
argument. But that doesn't undermine her case entirely. Thernstrom
is translating for broad consumption a debate raging among
economists. It is widely known that there is a huge economic return
on higher education in general.
</P>
<P>
   The question is: Is there a bigger one on an education at an
elite school? In other words, does it matter where you went to
college or that you went to college?
</P>
<P>
   In purely economic terms, it turns out, it matters only that you
went to college. But pure economics doesn't explain why people like
Thernstrom care so much about getting their kids into Harvard. The
answer is that a Harvard education does more than get your child
into the middle-class, or even the upper-middle class. It plugs
your child directly into a network of people who make up what used
to be called the Establishment--which is exactly where Thernstrom
would want her daughter to be.

 (ATTN: Minn., Mass.)   (For release Sunday, Oct. 11)

<P>
   Historically, getting a musical composition published was more
than a practical way of putting a new score into circulation. It
was a tangible sign that a composer had arrived on the scene and
was to be taken seriously.
</P>
<P>
   That situation has changed. The music publishing business was
already in crisis some 15 years ago, when personal computer
programs enabled composers to create manuscripts as attractive and
legible as engraved published scores. Now that such programs have
become less complicated and more flexible, the computer-generated
score is the standard.
</P>
<P>
   Many composers still write music by hand. But most create scores
through the musical equivalent of desktop publishing, and this
practice has profoundly changed the way music is distributed and
the very meaning of publishing. Copyright lawyers, royalty
collection agencies and musicians everywhere are racing to keep
pace with the technology.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, the changes affect many other areas of art and
commerce, including the cataloging of music, as a striking recent
example makes clear. In May, Hinshaw, a music publishing house,
released ``The Literature of Chamber Music,'' by Arthur Cohn: a
four-volume, 3,075-page encyclopedia of chamber works, ranging from
Baroque trio sonatas to contemporary compositions. Decades in
preparation, it was the final work of Cohn, a tireless scholar and
musician who died in February at 87, before this labor of love was
published.
</P>
<P>
   If you are a musician looking for an unusual work to perform _ a
string trio by the Mexican composer Manuel Ponce, perhaps _ or a
program annotator wondering why a Haydn string quartet (Op. 50, No.
6) is nicknamed the ``Frog,'' this compilation will be invaluable.
But ``The Literature of Chamber Music'' is less comprehensive when
it comes to music by living or recently deceased composers, because
Cohn focuses for the most part on published works.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Mendelssohn, most of whose chamber works were
published, that selection procedure is adequate. But it is less so
with a turn-of-the-century composer like Milhaud, and quite
inadequate with a living master like Donald Martino, whose works
have mostly been self-published.
</P>
<P>
   Martino's catalog of chamber pieces is extensive, but Cohn lists
only five. Just one work by John Harbison is included, even though
this Pulitzer Prize-winning composer has written many chamber
pieces that have been performed widely. Even the ``Kroslish''
Sonata, by the flinty genius Ralph Shapey, which was composed in
1985 for two high-profile musicians, the cellist Joel Krosnick and
the pianist Gilbert Kalish, is not included, presumably because it
has yet to be published by a major house.
</P>
<P>
   Cohn made a valiant effort to include published works no longer
available, reasoning correctly that they were obtainable from
libraries. Of course, even an encyclopedia has to stop somewhere,
and if Cohn had tried to include every discoverable piece, ``The
Literature of Chamber Music'' would probably have been 24 volumes.
Still, the sketchy listings of more recent works signal, however
inadvertently, the tremendous change the personal computer has
wrought on music publishing.
</P>
<P>
   Most composers started giving up on the major publishing houses
long ago. The engraving of classical-music scores is an expensive
process, and the market for them has never been large. To keep
1,000 copies of even so important a work as Elliott Carter's Cello
Sonata in stock represents an enormous investment.
</P>
<P>
   And as in other fields, smaller, principled publishing houses
have increasingly been sold to conglomerates. Even family-run
companies with important catalogs, like Carl Fischer, enter
publication limbo when ownership changes hands, as Cohn knew from
his experience as director of ``serious music'' at Fischer.
</P>
<P>
   So it was natural for composers to step into the breech, as
Gunther Schuller did in the late 1970s, founding two publishing
companies, Margun and Gunmar, to disseminate a wide range of
contemporary works. If the big firms were not going to take care of
composers, he reasoned, composers had better take care of
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   But most composers know little about the business side of music,
says Fran Richards, the director of concert music for the American
Association of Composers, Authors and Publishers. As the oldest and
largest performing rights organization in the country, ASCAP
licenses compositions and collects royalty fees for its members.
</P>
<P>
   ``Composers think that if they put themselves in the hands of a
big publishing house, then the gates of heaven will open,'' Ms.
Richards said. ``They are getting wiser, but they must engage
themselves in the business, and I work continually with composers
to help.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Richards offers a simple illustration of the complexity of
the problem: a new piece is played before 5,000 listeners at a
national flute convention, and many flutists want to order it. But
from whom?
</P>
<P>
   There used to be two choices: if it is published, order it from
the publisher; if not, get a copy directly from the composer. But
computer technology has created new options, the most intriguing
being the growth of small companies that work with scores prepared
by composers on computers.
</P>
<P>
   One such company is Davidge Publishing, founded six years ago by
Gail Davidge, a 46-year-old single mother with a background in
marketing, who runs it part-time from her home near St. Paul. Ms.
Davidge tends to a roster of 14 composers, but there are aspects of
the publishing business, as it has been done by the major houses,
that Ms. Davidge does not do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't do engraving of manuscripts but work from
computer-prepared scores,'' she said. ``I don't proofread scores. I
don't keep large quantities of music in stock.'' It is more
cost-effective to keep a hard copy on file and photocopy quantities
of scores as ordered.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, unlike major publishers, Ms. Davidge does not
pick and choose among a composer's works. She accepts everything
into her catalog.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``I take a holistic approach to the business,'' she said. ``I
work with composers closely and get to know them as people. I even
help with grant proposals and contract writing. It's a very
symbiotic relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Relieved of the cost of engraving scores and maintaining large
stocks, Ms. Davidge can concentrate on proselytizing for her
composers, marketing their works, mailing requested scores and
seeing that royalty fees are collected.
</P>
<P>
   Significantly, she offers her clients a co-copyright
arrangement, which is unusual. In book publishing, it has been
traditional for the author to retain the copyright to a book. In
music publishing, for reasons that have never been adequately
explained, the composer has traditionally ceded the copyright to
the publisher. So Ms. Davidge's policy is attractive and may be a
model for the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no mechanism within the big corporate structure of
major publishing houses to devote time and energy to introducing a
new work of music,'' she said. ``I don't get paid for my time. It
can take 18 months for a publisher's royalty fee to be returned
after a piece has been performed, a long lag time for a restless
corporate entity. My share of a first year's royalty for a new work
might be $12. But I believe in my people and believe that in time
they will have works with a good return.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the composers Ms. Davidge is literally banking on are
up-and-coming names, including Scott Lindorth, Tina Davidson, Paul
Schoenfield, Randall Woolf and Scott Wheeler.
</P>
<P>
   There is a downside to the new technology, says composer Charles
Fussell, who is a holdout. Fussell still prepares his scores by
hand, though when the Newton Symphony in Massachusetts commissioned
a work from him, the orchestra paid for the preparation of a
handsome engraved score. That work, ``Wilde: A Symphony in Three
Movements for Baritone and Orchestra,'' was a finalist for the 1991
Pulitzer Prize in music.
</P>
<P>
   ``I miss music stores,'' Fussell said recently, places where you
can go and browse through scores. There are not many left, and it's
a tremendous loss.'' The work of the American Music Center in New
York, which serves as a clearing house for works by living American
composers, is therefore critical, Fussell added.
</P>
<P>
   But here, too, the computer is coming to the rescue, in this
case with the Web site. Increasingly, musicians browse through new
compositions via Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Cohn's survey of chamber music will also help spread
the word. When Cohn started preparing this work decades ago, the
personal computer did not exist, so it is understandable that his
volumes take no account of the implications of the computer for
publishing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arthur was the kind of scholar who reverently pored over
scores by great composers,'' Ms. Richards said. ``So everyone
should remember how precious, how revitalizing it is to be involved
with bringing a new work, a new score, to the public for the first
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, those scores will be prepared on computers.
Composers and publishers will communicate via e-mail. Musicians
will browse through Web sites in search of new works. And if
everyone involved adapts, the future could be bright indeed.

<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ At the Orleans Hotel and Casino, a blocky behemoth a
mile or so off the famous Strip and a notch or two down the luxury
ladder, the first Las Vegas Film Festival concluded on a recent
weekend with a fitting bit of self-celebration. The honoree at the
closing-night banquet was the director George Sidney, a local
resident whose signature film was ``Viva Las Vegas,'' a 1964
vehicle for Elvis Presley and Ann-Margret.
</P>
<P>
   A day or two earlier, Gov. Bob Miller appeared at the Rio Suites
Hotel and Casino to announce the arrival in November, in the Rio's
own gallery, of an exhibition of Romanov dynasty art objects from
the czars' summer palace at Peterhof, outside St. Petersburg. ``In
our lifetime,'' said Miller at a poolside news conference, ``we
will never have another exhibit like this.''
</P>
<P>
   And of course the entire city, if not the world, is aware by now
that the Bellagio Hotel, Stephen Wynn's $1.8 billion luxury palace,
is set to open on Oct. 15, complete with a gallery for his own
collection of modern masterworks by the likes of Miro, Pollock and
de Kooning, and a Picasso-themed restaurant decorated with real
Picassos.
</P>
<P>
   This mishmash of high art and low, the classy and the crass, is
perhaps the newest wrinkle in a place known for making new wrinkles
out of ideas born elsewhere. As the city's gaming industry faces
increasing competition from other places with legalized gambling,
the casino owners have begun to emphasize other attractions.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a clash between the casino culture and the small
but increasingly active arts community, itself struggling for a
toehold in a rapidly growing city. As Miller said at the Rio, ``If
you don't have the arts, you don't have any soul whatsoever.''
</P>
<P>
   So, yes, the arts do exist here, and it should not be surprising
that they are growing. It is an inevitable consequence of the
remarkable expansion of this city, which has ballooned to 1.2
million people from 795,000 in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   There are a dozen or so fledgling theater companies in town. And
for a variety of reasons, from the climate to cheap housing, the
city has attracted visual artists who find a dizzying array of
stimuli in the lovely desert surroundings, the cartoonish casino
architecture that mimics and hyperbolizes famous landmarks from
around the world, and the constant flow of visitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Las Vegas is a simulacrum of simulacra,'' said Robert
Beckmann, a painter who has lived in the city since 1977 and whose
work has used imagery as diverse as nuclear test sites, the
neon-saturated Strip and nearby mountainscapes. ``There is no place
like it,'' he added. ``It's constantly cannibalizing not only the
art of the world, but itself.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is, alas, no escaping Vegas in Vegas, and because the
arts, along with everything else, remain in the thrall of the
casino culture, they have less of an independent presence here than
perhaps in any other big city in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   As retirees have flocked here, as well as families in search of
employment at the ever-multiplying casinos, this corner of the
desert has bloomed with housing, and with it, the needs of
residents for home-grown culture.
</P>
<P>
   The city programs dozens of free concerts and ethnic festivals
in the parks; it also supports a children's theater and four
cultural centers, which attract thousands of people every month to
classes and performances. But this is still a place where the
Liberace Museum gets more visitors than the natural history and
children's museums combined.
</P>
<P>
   The gaming industry is a noisy one, said Constance DeVereaux,
executive director of the Allied Arts Council of Southern Nevada, a
nonprofit organization with 65 arts groups under its regional
umbrella, ``and art tends to be very quiet. The arts do tend to be
hidden from the local population.''
</P>
<P>
   Casinos Upstaged Arts Community
</P>
<P>
   The council, whose mission is to promote arts awareness, was
founded in 1961 and at one time published a lively newsletter, Arts
Alive, 16 times a year. But as the casino industry boomed, the arts
flagged, and by 1991 the council had grown moribund. Ms. DeVereaux
was hired two years ago to resuscitate it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may have a thriving arts community, but we're very young
and don't have the infrastructure that exists in other places,''
Ms. DeVereaux said. ``It's taken an influx of people to get us
started, but the city has grown so fast it makes it hard to let
people know what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the prevailing wisdom in Las Vegas is that a hungry
audience exists for the arts, but no one knows where it is or how
to tap into it. The Nevada Dance Theater, a 20-year-old ballet
company, is thriving, but the symphony and the opera, once active,
are now moribund.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Nevada at Las Vegas has a fine arts college
with 1,600 students in art, architecture, dance, film, music and
theater. It also has an 1,800-seat concert hall, where since 1977
it has been holding performances by artists including Yo Yo Ma,
Isaac Stern and Jean-Pierre Rampal. But the theater is rarely
filled.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of Culture and Empty Seats
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard since I've been here that this is a cultural
wasteland,'' said Jeffrey Koep, the dean of the arts college, who
came to Las Vegas in 1989. ``But that's not true. Culture is coming
here; it's just that our house is not full. American Ballet
Theater, Alvin Ailey, they did not sell out. For the Boston Pops
there was a miserable turnout. If I have a mission, it's to get
people in to see them. We've reached critical mass in our
population, as opposed to 1989, but obviously we're still in our
adolescence in making the arts bloom.''
</P>
<P>
   The city's principal art collector is Wynn, the resort tycoon,
whose gallery is advertised on the Bellagio marquee on the Strip,
in a sign treating the artists with same reverence accorded
Siegfried and Roy _ ``Now appearing: Van Gogh, Monet, Cezanne,
Picasso.'' Wynn's collection has been valued at more than $300
million.
</P>
<P>
   The Las Vegas Art Museum, which moved into its own space for the
first time a year and a half ago, shares quarters with a library in
a new building in the far western reaches of the city and has a
budget of only about $300,000 a year. The museum couldn't afford to
buy a detail from one of Wynn's paintings.
</P>
<P>
   In a city that bills itself as ``the entertainment capital of
the world,'' membership in the musicians union has declined from
2,200 in 1979 to 850 today, largely because the hotels and casinos
on the Strip now use taped or synthesized music instead of
orchestras.
</P>
<P>
   The 12-year-old Actors Repertory Theater, the city's largest
theater company, drew more people last year to ``Jeffrey,'' Paul
Rudnick's comedy about the dating life of a gay man in the age of
AIDS, than it did to ``Annie.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Neu, the company's artistic director, is one of several
people who lamented the lack of support for local arts groups by
the government and the casinos. The city of Las Vegas supports its
own programs but makes no grants; the state arts council, with the
backing of the governor, has almost tripled its budget in the last
five years, but it only recently opened a branch office in Las
Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pathetic here, pathetic,'' Ms. Neu said, noting that
``there are dozens and dozens of casinos giving nothing back to the
community.''
</P>
<P>
   Some casinos do, actually, support the arts in a modest way
(Joseph Palermo, president of the Las Vegas Arts Museum, named the
Santa Fe and the now-under-construction Venetian as donors). But in
any case, the role of the casinos in the arts is changing as they
are beginning to participate in arts presentation, motivated by the
changing profile of the Las Vegas visitor.
</P>
<P>
   The city remains, of course, a glittering Oz for tourists; an
astounding 30.5 million people visited last year.
</P>
<P>
   But surveys last year by the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors
Bureau showed that for the first time, more people say they come
here for the entertainment than for the casinos. For the
hotel-casino owners, this means expanding what they offer to
attract customers and to keep them within the walls of their hotels
once they get there.
</P>
<P>
   In his office at the Mirage Hotel, surrounded by the work of
Pollock, de Kooning and Jasper Johns, Wynn agreed that the casinos
were leading the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do I think of fine art as being properly presented in a
resort hotel in Las Vegas?'' Wynn asked. He answered himself. ``The
image of our city is so established that it's quite difficult to
amend it.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he continued, the Bellagio was conceived ``as a hotel of
distinction in absolute terms, one of the loveliest places to
visit, in any century, on any continent. If we can achieve that
high-sounding goal, we would be making the pie here bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   Wynn is not alone. In addition to the Russian exhibit, the Rio
Suite Hotel and Casino has commissioned and displayed the work of
20 Nevada artists, and Harrah's and the Hilton followed suit. Sam's
Town, a hotel and casino in the southeast part of the city, has
been inviting local artists into its courtyard to paint and sell
their work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is redefining where art can be viewed,'' said
Robert Tracy, the assistant dean of the fine arts college. ``And it
will help redefine the city as a place of connoisseurs.''
</P>
<P>
   But others wonder whether the casino exhibits will steal
audiences from the starving galleries and museum. ``If a casino can
bring art inside, that's one less reason for tourists to go out,''
said Ms. DeVereaux of the arts council. ``What do you get from art
in a casino? I'm not sure. If you get buyers, that's great. But I'm
not sure I want to celebrate art in casinos.''
</P>
<P>
   An Artsy Scene With a Vegas Twist
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. DeVereaux and others, the alternative was provided at
the annual auction for the Nevada Institute for Contemporary Art,
which drew some 200 people downtown on a recent Friday evening.
Gallery owners, artists, arts agency administrators, university
faculty members and a handful of government officials gathered at
the Arts Factory, a warehouselike building that holds several
commercial galleries.
</P>
<P>
   The event, featuring the donated work of 61 local painters and
sculptors, raised $40,000 for the institute, known locally as NICA,
a 12-year-old nonprofit gallery that is generally acknowledged to
be the most serious in town. This was its sixth auction, but the
first not held at a casino, mainly because the institute, which is
now located in a roadside mall a few miles away, is to move to the
Arts Factory next spring.
</P>
<P>
   The hope is that by consolidating the city's arts community
downtown, an arts district that is geographically and spiritually
distinct from the Strip will take root.
</P>
<P>
   So instead of tuxes and sequined gowns, the attendees were
dressed more casually. The atmosphere was more SoHo than the Strip,
more arty than kitschy _ at least until the sale began. Then, as
the auctioneer called lot No. 1, the first painting was carried out
and displayed by a woman who was naked except for body paint and a
tiny G-string. Lot No. 2 was presented by a similarly unattired
man.
</P>
<P>
   Watching the proceedings, Jerry Schefcik, an art professor and
the director of the university art gallery, grinned. He was a
little pleased, a little embarrassed. ``Welcome to Las Vegas,'' he
said.

   NEW YORK _ We might think we know her; after all, she kept
telling us Tuesday night at the Continental Airlines Arena in East
Rutherford, N.J., that she loved us. But mostly all we know of
Janet Jackson is the family photos, the love for children and
animals.
</P>
<P>
   And the numbers: No. 2 in most Top 10 hits of all female
artists; No. 7 in most Top 10 hits of all artists; most gold
singles by a female artist. The statistics go on and on.
</P>
<P>
   There's too much index, not enough text. We don't really know
her, we can't feel her anxieties. So she has adopted a theme of
revelation to prove to everybody _ but most of all to herself _
that she has secrets worth telling.
</P>
<P>
   Usually a nobody balloons into a pop icon and then hits a period
of maturation and withdrawal, constructing a more delicate and
guarded personality. Ms. Jackson, conversely, has upon turning 30
taken to making interview pronouncements like, ``You have to let go
in order to truly be in control.'' She has a wrist tattoo of a
South African symbol that represents the wisdom in learning from
the past, whereas most pop stars would prefer to focus on the
future.
</P>
<P>
   As she struggles to get over her fame, there's a diffuse
grandiosity about her, and a result is that the deluxe,
multipartite dimensions of the ``Velvet Rope'' tour look a little
awkward. Her personality is small, coy and secretive; would
anyone's be great enough to sustain the three-ring circus of
self-analysis that this tour presents?
</P>
<P>
   The tour, which began in March and is to run through January,
includes spectacular costumes and dance sequences, from zoot-suited
chorus lines to Alice-in-Wonderland playgrounds of inflatable moons
and clocks. (It continues Sunday and Monday at Madison Square
Garden in Manhattan, and will be shown live on HBO on Sunday night
at 9.) But in its act-by-act progression it feels a little bit like
a short story writer's disjointed attempt at a novel. It would be
unrealistic to expect thematic cohesion in a massive pop show; one
just watched the flashpots explode and let the connecting theme be
Janet Jackson. But who was she?
</P>
<P>
   As ever, she was her songs: the furious, betrayed lover in
``What About,'' the drama-queen seductress toying with a trussed-up
audience member in ``Rope Burn,'' a dance-floor sensualist in
``Throb,'' a soft-focus nostalgist screening her baby pictures in
``Special,'' a pillar of empathy in ``Together Again.''
</P>
<P>
   She physically inhabited each song, glared stonily in the angry
ones, smiled beatifically in the ballads. And she blended into her
touring company. Ms. Jackson's Tinkerbell voice wove in and out of
her backup singers' strong projection; judging when and whether she
was lip-synching became the evening's fascinating game. Surrounded
by 10 dancers _ whom she took longer to introduce than her band _
Ms. Jackson integrated her own dancing and singing into a larger
phalanx of action. Her identity was subsumed by the production.
There was quite a bit of Ms. Jackson _ her stamina and
professionalism in a long, intensely physical concert were
remarkable _ but an awful lot of show.
</P>
<P>
   As opposed to the range of intents on Ms. Jackson's palette,
Usher, who opened the concert, is monochrome: a one-man erotic
arrow aimed at teen-age girls. Bejeweled from collar to sneakers,
he sang bubble-gum R-and-B; in each song, to the crowd's huge
delight, he promised relief and satisfaction. There was a weird
disjunction between the cooing kid-stuff sheen of his songs and his
undiluted sexual posturing onstage, which included, most memorably,
pouring a bottle of water down his midriff and pumping his hips so
that the water splashed forth toward the audience.

   NEW YORK _ Much has been made of Bill T. Jones' recent turn
toward abstraction after a series of full-evening dramatic dances,
parables for our time that explored a variety of social themes. But
those who have seen his shorter pieces could not have been
surprised by Jones' latest work, ``We Set Out Early . . .
Visibility Was Poor,'' performed by the Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane
Dance Company on Tuesday night at the Brooklyn Academy of Music as
part of the Next Wave Festival.
</P>
<P>
   Jones' theme dances have had the messy, bold vitality of
still-wet clots of color patched from a palette knife onto a
painting. Both the shorter works and this new suite of three dances
are elegant fashion photography with undercurrents of mostly
uncategorizable emotions. The emotions are heightened and deepened
in ``We Set Out Early,'' however, signaling the possibility of a
provocative merging of genres in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Jones himself opened the evening with ``Prelude,'' a solo that
captured his unsettling mix of wariness and sensuality with simple
stretching, oozing motion and an increasingly extemporized, mocking
version of the folk song ``Billy Boy.''
</P>
<P>
   The new dance began with ``On the TSII,'' set to Stravinsky's
``Histoire du Soldat,'' one of the most difficult but apparently
unignorable dance scores of the 20th century. Superficial posing
for its first three-quarters, ``On the TSII'' had the dancers
interacting suavely with a ballet barre and puzzlingly cawing and
cheeping like birds with a lead bird, Germaul Barnes, wearing a
bunched tail of extra fabric. A late sudden explosion of electric
energy set a contrasting tone for the piece that followed, ``Cape
Bardo,'' set to John Cage's ``Empty Words, Sonata and Music for
Marcel Duchamp.''
</P>
<P>
   The title ``We Set Out Early'' suggests a slow trajectory
through time. This second section, ``Cape Bardo,'' might symbolize
the cool respite of post-modernism after the hectic, edgy energies
of a young century, represented by the Stravinsky score. In the
dance, a measured processional with overtones of Jerome Robbins'
``Watermill'' and Paul Taylor's ``Rune,'' the luminous Eric Bradley
warms up at the front of the stage as a slow-moving couple walk by
in the shadows at the back, followed by dancers who emerge from and
disappear into the darkness.
</P>
<P>
   Cage posited that sounds and silence were music. Jones turns the
gradual dismantling of a large, sleek overhanging steel sculpture
from the first act into understated theater and dance, most
magically when the lines of the poles and the dancers' limbs merge
inseparably into a shimmering thicket of horizontal parallels.
Above, a huge, glowing, white paper lozenge moves slowly and
inexorably across the stage and disappears, followed by the rise of
the dismantled sculpture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Voiceland,'' the new work's third section, uses an
emotion-drenched score by a Latvian composer, Peteris Vasks, as a
charged aural landscape for a cluster of silently jabbering,
scrabbling men and women. They might be doomed survivors of some
cataclysm, their lives at first circumscribed by the rectangles
made by the overhanging sculpture and by light. Their moves are
tinged with late-20th-century disco and street dancing.
</P>
<P>
   There are moments of uncomplicated joy and affection, in early
bounding runs and gentle and thwacking embraces. Bradley and the
quietly eloquent Rosalynde LeBlanc draw near as hushed young
lovers. But panic overtakes them all in dance that paradoxically
builds with the music as gesture and situation become increasingly
distilled.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, his set designer, Bjorn Amelan, and the lighting
designer, Robert Wierzel, have a grand vision, and they achieve it,
in a time when many artists seem embarrassed by the idea of
grandeur.
</P>
<P>
   The strong cast also included Miguel Anaya, Alexandra Beller,
Christian Canciani, Daniel Russell Kubert, Toshiko Oiwa, Odile
Reine-Adelaide and Maya Saffrin. Liz Prince designed the stylish
costumes. Gregory Bain was the production director.

FOR A MASTERLY NOVICE, A TRIUMPH OVER TIME  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 11) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)

<P>
   PARIS _ Had Erick Zonca's first feature film been
autobiographical, as so many French first movies seem to be, it
might well have been set in New York: a young illegal immigrant,
who washes dishes in a Little Italy restaurant and sleeps in
Washington Square, falls in love with a dancer and discovers a
different America.
</P>
<P>
   Or it could have been set on the Paris Left Bank where the same
Frenchman, now in his late 20s, wangles his way into the Sorbonne
only to find he understands nothing of the course he has chosen.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, young movie directors often tap their own lives for
material because they have known no other. But Zonca is now 42 and,
in the precocious world of aspiring moviemakers, that means he is
old. It also means that he has done a fair amount of living, enough
at least to discover more interesting movie subjects than his own
version of down-and-out in New York and Paris.
</P>
<P>
   So perhaps this explains why his acclaimed first film, ``The
Dreamlife of Angels,'' which closes the New York Film Festival on
Sunday night, does not feel like a first film. It is, so to speak,
post-autobiographical.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, it (italics)is(end italics) a first film in that it
came out of nowhere: even in the French movie business, few people
had heard of Erick Zonca. Until, that is, ``The Dreamlife of
Angels'' was given a 12-minute ovation at this year's Cannes
International Film Festival and Elodie Bouchez and Natacha Regnier,
who play the lead roles, went on to share the festival's best
actress award.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, which cost $2 million, has now paid for itself
through sales to some 40 countries; it has just opened to
near-unanimous rave reviews in France; and it is scheduled to be
released in the United States in early March.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went to Cannes as an adventure, determined to have a good
time, to amuse ourselves,'' Zonca recalled in a recent interview in
a Paris production office, where he was editing his next movie.
``Then it all happened. It was the most beautiful possible way of
going to Cannes. Something like that can only happen once.''
</P>
<P>
   The film's plot is deceptively simple. Isa (Ms. Bouchez) arrives
with her backpack in an industrial town in northern France looking
for a friend. She finds work in a dress-making factory where she
meets Marie (Ms. Regnier), who is house-sitting an apartment and
offers Isa a place to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   At first the two young women get on well, even double-dating a
pair of motorcyclists-cum-bouncers, but their different
personalities soon surface. Isa, generous and gentle, discovers she
is camping in the bedroom of a girl who is in a hospital in a coma
and immediately starts visiting the girl.
</P>
<P>
   Marie, insecure and quick-tempered, falls for Chriss (Gregoire
Colin), a wealthy young philanderer whom she knows to be bad news.
When Chriss humiliates her, she turns her anger against Isa, who
finally decides it is time to move on.
</P>
<P>
   Where the movie scores, in the view of many critics, is in the
development of the main characters, not only the two young women
and Chriss, but also the two soft-hearted bouncers, Charly (Patrick
Mercado) and Fredo (Jo Prestia). The screenplay, co-written by
Zonca and Roger Bohbot, was not improvised, yet the movie exudes a
real-life mood reminiscent of the work of, say, Mike Leigh or John
Cassavetes.
</P>
<P>
   And in this tight-focused world, where emotions constantly
determine behavior, it is the pretty blonde Marie who rages against
life, while the boyish Isa, with her mop-top haircut, is at peace
with her lot.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there may be echoes of autobiography in the director's
creation of two lead characters. Isa, the footloose wanderer, is a
social outsider; Marie, disturbed and distrustful, is an emotional
outsider, and Zonca, for most of his life, has felt like an
outsider.
</P>
<P>
   Born into an affluent family of Italian descent in Orleans in
the north central region of France, Zonca dropped out of school at
16 and moved to Paris at 17, fantasizing about a career as a
screenwriter but in practice soon reduced to doing odd jobs.
Eventually he signed up for a Method-inspired drama course run by
two Americans, Blanche Salant and Paul Weaver, but that still did
not bring him into the mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did courses where we were never ready to look for work,''
he said. ``We were in a sort of isolated retreat of introspection
and psychoanalysis, an imaginary American world filled with actors
like Robert De Niro and Al Pacino. When I tried to write
screenplays, I even saw Americans playing the roles. That's why I
went to the United States. I had heard there were courses where
foreigners could lose their accents. I had this naive dream of
becoming an American actor.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not to be. In fact, in New York _ at the Bleecker Street
Cinema, to be exact _ Zonca belatedly discovered European movies.
And after a richly-varied three-year stay, during which he
graduated from the kitchen of Umberto's Clam House to the acting
courses of the Herbert Bergoff Studio, he decided that he could
only make movies in France.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But he also recognized that he still needed an education, so he
signed up at the Sorbonne to study philosophy. Then, when he saw he
was ill-prepared for the course, he dropped out and instead
attended classes that he enjoyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``At 30, I concluded that I was a total `has been,' '' he noted,
``because I wanted to do cinema and I had absolutely no experience
in the medium.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he found work in television, first as an unpaid intern,
then as an assistant director helping to make sitcoms and
documentaries for an independent production company. Realizing he
could not hope to make a feature film without any experience in
cinema, he began sending off scripts for short movies to different
producers until one, Francois Marquis, responded.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Zonca made his first film, ``Rives,'' which did well on
the festival circuit, as did his second 30-minute short,
``Eternelles.'' The prize money for these two then helped finance
yet another well received short, ``Seule,'' and by then Marquis was
ready to produce Zonca's first feature film.
</P>
<P>
   The script for ``The Dreamlife of Angels'' took time to come
together. The first draft suggested a four-hour movie and pursued
the story of Isa after she left Marie. Zonca then cut the
screenplay in half, leaving Isa's post-Marie experiences to form
the basis of his next film, ``Les Petits Voleurs,'' which was
commissioned by the French-German cultural television station,
Arte.
</P>
<P>
   From the story's inception, though, he wanted Isa to be played
by Ms. Bouchez, 25, whose 15 screen roles since 1991 include an
award-winning part in Andre Techine's ``Wild Reeds.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was flattered, but I did not like the first screenplay,''
she said in a telephone interview. ``I felt it was too full of
cliches, and the role of Isa was too passive, too soft. With time,
the script improved, but I still couldn't find the link between
Erick's shorts, which were so good, and his screenplay. Finally, I
decided to trust him and to trust myself. And on the first day of
shooting, I found my voice; I found out how to create Isa, how to
make her work. After that, it was pure pleasure from start to
finish.''
</P>
<P>
   Zonca said that once he had persuaded her to cut her hair short
enough for the part, Ms. Bouchez was a model of professionalism. In
contrast, he noted, Ms. Regnier, also in her early 20s, had
previously acted in just one film and was ``more a young actress
finding her way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We got on very well, and we also argued all the time,'' Ms.
Regnier conceded. ``Erick is someone who never lets go, who pushes
all the way, and that creates tension, but it is very positive
tension. I prefer to work with someone like that than with someone
who doesn't seem to care.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, casting Ms. Bouchez and Ms. Regnier as Isa and Marie
proved to be one of the triumphs of the film: both actresses even
admit a resemblance to the roles they play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm close to Isa in her openness to the world and to other
people and in her generosity, which is a trait that I value a
lot,'' Ms. Bouchez said softly. And Ms. Regnier offered more
sternly: ``It's true that, like Marie, I make no concessions to
life, I never give way. I have always done what I want. There is
also a bit of the wild in me.''
</P>
<P>
   France being France, of course, some critics here have looked
for a social message in the film as a story of working-class women
rejected by a world of materialism. But such talk prompts Zonca
only to roll his eyes with impatience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to put in any social message,'' he said. ``I
just want to make films that tell stories. But there's a problem in
France. You always have to have a message _ a `discours' _ a point
of view, or you're in trouble. In the United States, you don't have
that problem. I had no intention of telling people what I think
about the working classes. This is simply a film about being an
outsider.''

COMPANY SHUTDOWN SUGGESTS CHINA MAY FINALLY BE GETTING TOUGH 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By SETH FAISON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI _ The government shutdown of a prominent state-run
investment company, the Guangdong International Trust &AMP; Investment
Corp., shows that China may finally be getting tough with insolvent
financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Although debt problems plagued Guangdong International, the
nation's second-largest trust and investment company behind the
China International Trust and Investment Corp., what surprised
economists and bankers is that the government decided to take
decisive action against such a well-known institution.
</P>
<P>
   China's official media reported that its central bank revoked
the operating license of Guangdong International, also known as
Gitic, on Tuesday because it could not repay its debts. The Bank of
China, one of China's four policy-making banks, was ordered to take
charge of repaying those liabilities.
</P>
<P>
   The size of the debt was not made public. Like many Chinese
companies, Guangdong International operated such a web of
subsidiaries and shell companies that it is difficult for outsiders
to calculate the true size of either its debts or assets.
</P>
<P>
   In financial terms, the collapse was seen as relatively
insignificant. Analysts at Salomon Smith Barney in Hong Kong
estimated that Guangdong International had assets of just $2.8
billion at the end of 1997, with nearly $1 billion in foreign debt.
Domestic debt may have been far larger.
</P>
<P>
   What is significant is that until now, it had been virtually
inconceivable for Beijing to close a prestigious investment company
like Guangdong International. In the past, state-run companies with
good connections to the central government have generally been able
to rely on bailouts, often based on endless debt restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   But Beijing's leaders have been alarmed at the crisis facing
several Asian neighbors, which have been swamped by the same kind
of financial overexposure that plagues many Chinese financial
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Although China has so far been spared the worst of Asia's
crisis, officials in Beijing have said they intend to make China's
notoriously debt-ridden banks and investment companies more
accountable. Economists estimate that Chinese banks have more than
$200 billion in outstanding debt to failing state industries that
are unlikely ever to repay it.
</P>
<P>
   Yet without shareholder or market pressure to have a full
accounting, many of China's banks indefinitely postpone any genuine
inventory of their creditworthiness. That sort of endless rolling
over of debt may now finally be changing.
</P>
<P>
   A critical but partly hidden factor in the fate of Guangdong
International has been a political revamping in Guangdong Province,
beginning early this year. After enjoying breakneck development
with skimpy regulation in the 1980s and early 1990s, Guangdong has
recently come under greater scrutiny from Prime Minister Zhu
Rongji.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu traveled to Guangdong repeatedly this year to confront local
officials about financial irregularities and helped Wang Qishan, a
rising star in Beijing who headed the China Construction Bank,
become deputy governor in charge of financial restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   Guangdong International was set up in 1980 to manage investments
on behalf of Guangdong Province, the fast-developing region that
borders Hong Kong. Its investments included the Guangzhou-Shantou
railway, power plants in Dongguan and the Shenzhen Science and
Technology Park. It sold more than $400 million of international
bonds.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, its heavy exposure to real estate in southern
China went sour. Like other state-run investment and trust
companies, it often relied less on creative or strategic planning
than on local connections.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Guangdong International's debt repayment has been suspended
until January 1999 as Bank of China officials determine how to
prioritize the debts.

NASA CHIEF TELLS LAWMAKERS THAT SPACE STATION SHOULD BE SCRAPPED IF
IT CAN'T BE FUNDED PROPERLY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Under fire for his plan to bail out Russia for its
participation in the international space station, NASA
administrator Dan Goldin told lawmakers Wednesday that the
ambitious project should be scrapped if it cannot be properly
funded.
</P>
<P>
   Goldin's comments came during a testy meeting of the House
Science Committee, where lawmakers sharply criticized NASA
officials for their latest effort to deal with the delays in
receiving Russian parts, a problem precipitated by the economic
crisis there.
</P>
<P>
   NASA has proposed paying the Russian space agency $660 million
to complete its work on the station, including $60 million
immediately to ensure it does not fall further behind on its part
of the project. In return the Russians have agreed to give to the
Americans some of their research time on the space station.
</P>
<P>
   But the committee's chairman, Rep. James Sensenbrenner, said he
could not endorse a plan to bail out the Russians, arguing that
Americans should never have become so reliant on their
participation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plain truth is the White House is addicted to the
Russians,'' he said.``The administration needs to take the Russian
government out of the critical path _ now. Congress expected that
four years ago, and the administration promised we wouldn't become
dependent on Russia. It lied.''
</P>
<P>
   NASA also is expected to request an additional $560 million to
construct a propulsion module and other units to reduce long-term
U.S. reliance on the Russians.
</P>
<P>
   While lawmakers blasted Goldin for giving the Russians such a
critical role in building the station, the NASA chief retorted that
budget restraints placed on the agency had made it harder to reduce
the reliance.
</P>
<P>
   Goldin said that as a result of the balanced budget agreement
between the White House and Congress, NASA has been forced to cut
$40 billion from its annual budgets. He warned if those budget
restraints continue, the space station could be doomed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we cannot fund this properly because of this budget deal,
then maybe we should cancel the space station,'' Goldin said. ``We
can't create money out of magical places.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., said that Congress had agreed to fund
NASA at the full level requested by the Clinton administration next
year.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has insisted that NASA take any additional money
it needs for the station out of other space agency programs.
</P>
<P>
   Sensenbrenner warned that if the administration does not work
with Congress to come up with a solution to the Russian problem, he
will begin drafting his own legislation next year.
</P>
<P>
   However, Sensenbrenner did not explicitly threaten to block the
$60 million that NASA is requesting to send over this month to
Russia. Those funds, which would be transferred from a space
station reserve fund, must be approved by House and Senate
appropriators.
</P>
<P>
   While one expert questioned Russian capability to build the
station, Goldin said that the problem is solely financial. The
Russian government, strapped for funds, has not been paying its
space agency for months.
</P>
<P>
   He added that it would be wrong to further penalize Russians who
have already been working under difficult conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come from the school that says if someone is in trouble you
don't extract blood from them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Goldin's assessment was backed by Jay Chabrow, who chaired a
task force that recently estimated that space station costs are
escalating.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a big mistake to throw them aside. They are there.
All they need is cash flow,'' said Chabrow.
</P>
<P>
   But another expert, Judith Twigg, an assistant professor at
Virginia Commonwealth University, argued that even with more money
the Russians may not have the technical capability to continue
their work on the space station. She said that Russia had suffered
a brain drain, particularly among younger people, and had not
invested in its aerospace industry. &QL;

COMMENTARY: HALF A NATION, CONDEMNED 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BOB HERBERT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even as we overdose on the coverage of the frenzied, sex-based
madness in Washington, the tragic subjugation of nearly the entire
female population of Afghanistan goes scarcely noticed.
</P>
<P>
   Consider this fatal catch-22. By order of the Taliban, the
extremist Islamic movement that controls most of the country,
Afghan women are not allowed to work or go to school. That means
female doctors, with very few exceptions, cannot practice, and
women who want to be doctors cannot be trained. But male doctors
are not allowed to see or touch the bodies of female patients.
Thus, health care for most women has effectively vanished. Women
and girls, including babies, are dying needlessly from illnesses
that are left untreated.
</P>
<P>
   Physicians for Human Rights, which shared the 1997 Nobel Peace
Prize for its role in the International Campaign to Ban Landmines,
recently concluded a study of the conditions confronting the women
of Afghanistan under the rule of the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
   The executive director, Leonard Rubenstein, said in an interview
Wednesday, ``We are not aware of any place in the world in recent
history where women have so systematically been deprived of every
opportunity to survive in the society _ from working to getting an
education to walking on the street to getting health care.''
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, in their report, described Kabul, the Afghan
capital, as a city of beggars, with ``women who had once been
teachers and nurses now moving in the streets like ghosts under
their enveloping burqas, selling every possession and begging so as
to feed their children.''
</P>
<P>
   They said the restrictions on the examination and treatment of
sick and injured women had reached ``extreme dimensions.'' They
wrote:
</P>
<P>
   ``(Physicians for Human Rights) interviewed a male physician and
asked how he would treat an ailing woman patient. He indicated that
in some cases a male relative could point on his own body to places
where the patient felt pain, and he would prescribe medication for
the male relative to procure for her.''
</P>
<P>
   A woman who ran a clinic with her husband was ordered by the
Taliban to shut it down. She told a Physicians for Human Rights
researcher: ``When I tried to reason with them, they beat me and
told me that they would hang me if I showed up again at the
clinic.''
</P>
<P>
   The clinic was closed ``within 24 hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Zohra Rasekh, a senior health researcher and one of the authors
of the report, was chased by a young man wielding a metal cable
because her wrists had been exposed in public. She said she
narrowly escaped a beating.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, large numbers of women and girls are finding
themselves in desperately poor health. A woman was reported to have
died of appendicitis after she was turned away from two hospitals.
Researchers were told in separate interviews of two women who had
diabetes and were denied insulin at a clinic. Both were reported to
have died.
</P>
<P>
   A nurse told researchers that many women were dying at home
during labor. A pharmacist said, ``It is very difficult for
pregnant women since male doctors are prohibited from seeing
pregnant women and performing delivery. A lot of pregnant women die
at home and in hospitals and clinics.''
</P>
<P>
   Major depression and other psychiatric disorders are widespread.
A sense of hopelessness prevails, and suicide is a growing problem.
</P>
<P>
   Said one young woman: ``Two years ago I graduated from Kabul
University, but now the university door is closed to all female
students. Afghan women have no rights today. They are all walking
deads.''
</P>
<P>
   Women's rights groups in the United States, led by the Feminist
Majority Foundation, are trying to mount a campaign on behalf of
the women in Afghanistan. They are modeling the campaign on the
worldwide effort that helped bring down the system of racial
apartheid in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so horrific,'' said Eleanor Smeal, president of the
foundation. ``We thought that as a group if we could not arouse the
public on this, then what are we talking about when we say that
women are going forward?
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to care about this. I mean, to what level can women be
reduced? What's OK? If this is OK, it means we become this class of
people that you can do anything to.''

CHICAGO THEATER AND OPERA TO COLLABORATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By BRUCE WEBER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ In an unusual arrangement meant to encourage the
blurring of the distinction between genres, the Goodman Theater and
the Lyric Opera will collaborate on the development and production
of two new musical theater works, the two institutions announced
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Both William Mason, general director of Lyric, and Roche
Schulfer, executive director of the Goodman, said they believed
that such a partnership between an opera company and a theater
company was unprecedented.
</P>
<P>
   The new pieces are being written under the auspices of the
Lyric's composer-in-residence program, by two young
composer-lyricists, Michael John LaChiusa and Adam Guettel. Neither
has written an opera (though LaChiusa has written librettos), but
both are known for adventurous, challenging musicals with ties to
contemporary classical music as well as contemporary show music.
</P>
<P>
   Each project will be developed in workshops at the Lyric,
probably with singers from the Lyric's training program, and then
presented at the Goodman as part of its regular subscription
series. No budget has been set, but Mason said he expected each
project to cost ``in the mid-six figures.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Lyric, the appeal of the collaboration is
cross-pollination, for the art forms and for the audiences, he
said. ``We need to expand the list of 20 or so box-office favorites
that any opera company needs to have on its schedule in order to
survive,'' he said, adding that for that to happen, the new works
have to appeal to a wide audience.
</P>
<P>
   From the standpoint of the Goodman, which has produced 14
musicals, both revivals and new works, since 1986, the
collaboration provides a luxury that nonprofit theaters do not
often have. ``Time,'' Schulfer said. ``Developing new work these
days is a matter of finding time. Workshop time. Rehearsal time.
Revision time.''
</P>
<P>
   LaChiusa, 36, has written for both Broadway and off-Broadway;
his musicals include ``Hello Again.'' The new piece, for which he
has a preliminary libretto, is about a poet coming to terms with
the influences of his friends and family on his work.
</P>
<P>
   Guettel, 33, is best known for his musical ``Floyd Collins,''
which has had productions in Philadelphia and New York; the Goodman
will stage it next spring. He said he could not discuss the details
of his new project, because the rights to the story on which it is
based are not yet secure.
</P>
<P>
   There is no timetable for either project, though Schulfer said
he hoped to be able to present both early in the new millennium _
not too long after the Goodman opens its new downtown theater,
currently scheduled for 2000. Asked if they were producing operas
or musicals, Mason and Schulfer said they did not know yet. ``Maybe
we'll create pieces that go to Broadway or maybe they'll go to the
Houston opera house,'' Schulfer said.
</P>
<P>
   Mason added: ``We're starting out with no preconceived notion.
We're being so noble about this it's almost sickening.''

GLENN, DISCOVERY ASTRONAUTS TRAIN FOR EMERGENCY ESCAPES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., _ Mercury astronaut John Glenn may be 77,
but he braved the sweltering heat of the mosquito-infested Florida
swamps like a youngster Wednesday, as part of his campaign to
return to space.
</P>
<P>
   He is among seven astronauts preparing to blast off Oct. 29 from
the Kennedy Space Center aboard the shuttle Discovery. For Glenn,
twice a grandfather, the nine-day mission is a long- awaited encore
to the five-hour Mercury flight in 1962 that distinguished him as
the first American in orbit.
</P>
<P>
   So what do swamps and space have in common?
</P>
<P>
   Early Wednesday, shuttle commander Curt Brown, Glenn and the
rest of the Discovery crew took turns careening over the gravel
trails that wind around their coastal launching pad in a mustard
yellow armored personnel carrier.
</P>
<P>
   Their driving skills could be life saving if something went awry
during the final minutes of Discovery's countdown. Unlike Glenn's
tiny Mercury capsule, the shuttle is not equipped with an escape
rocket that could lift the astronauts quickly away from the
launching pad in the event of a fuel leak, fire or explosion.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, endangered shuttle crews must climb from the cockpit
unassisted, sprint across the launch tower while 200 feet above the
ground, then jump into a metal steel cage for a harrowing, 21
second slide down a 1,200 foot stretch of steel cable to the
ground. Then the astronauts either dive into a concrete reinforced
underground bunker or leap into a waiting Army M113 armored
personnel carrier, crash a security fence and speed toward the
safety of a nearby helicopter pad. The escape should take five
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Although every shuttle crew goes through the training, none has
been required to actually execute it during the 91 missions dating
back to 1981.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did real well,'' declared George Hoggard, the 61-year-old
fire captain at Kennedy who has supervised launch pad escape
training for three decades.
</P>
<P>
   With all his experience, Hoggard has the instruction down cold.
</P>
<P>
   Hoggard straps himself to the outside of the M113 and shouts 30
seconds of instruction to his astronaut driver, who pokes his head
through an opening in the top of the personnel carrier. Suddenly,
the diesel-powered vehicle growls to life and disappears in a cloud
of dust as it rolls over a 1 { mile course, reaching speeds of 45
mph.
</P>
<P>
   The controls include an accelerator pedal and two brake levers,
one for the continuous tracks on the right and the other on the
left. The personnel carrier is steered with the application of
brake pressure on either side.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him, he did a great job,'' Hoggard said of Glenn, who
steered the course in a respectable three minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm real proud to see him do this,'' said Hoggard, who feels a
kinship with Glenn because of their age. ``I admire him a heckava
lot for his efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   None of Brown's crew discussed their adventure with the 50
reporters who gathered to observe the exercise. But they seemed to
enjoy the outing in spite of the mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery's flight engineer, Scott Parazynski, proved the
speediest of the M113's drivers, navigating the course in two
minutes, 40 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The start and finish line for Wednesday's S-shaped course
provided at least small testament to the importance of the
training. The astronauts have dubbed it Lake Ochoa, in honor of
astronaut Ellen Ochoa who accidently steered the M113 through a
stand of scrub trees and into the swamp during an instruction drive
a couple of years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Luckily, all the people are really bright,'' Hoggard said of
his student drivers. ``The next time they may have to drive could
be in an emergency situation. They won't have time to think about
things. They need to jump in and drive.'' &QL;

MICHAELS, LONGTIME FORBES EDITOR, TO STEP DOWN 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk)

   For years, Forbes magazine staff members have murmured that
James W. Michaels _ the magazine's legendary, cantankerous and
perfectionist editor since 1961 _ would like to expire at his desk.
</P>
<P>
   But Michaels, 77, will step aside on Jan. 1, 1999, to become a
vice president of Forbes Inc., overseeing the editorial content
that makes up the Web sites, books and television projects of the
company. The managing editor, William Baldwin, 47, who joined the
magazine as a reporter in 1980, will succeed Michaels as editor.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Forbes, chief operating officer of Forbes, said the move was
made to accommodate Michaels' wishes to surrender the pressures of
an intense biweekly deadline. Asked why he was leaving, Michaels
would only say, ``My assignment now is to take what we've done with
Forbes magazine and try to translate this into related fields.''
</P>
<P>
   Michaels made a reputation as a big spender, with a fondness for
tearing up pages at the 11th hour and reconceiving stories to
accommodate breaking news at sometimes great cost. But Forbes said
this was never an issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim is indeed a perfectionist and we credit him with a great
deal of the success Forbes has enjoyed,'' Forbes said. ``In such a
context, it is not about expenses. His expenses in producing the
magazine are utterly, utterly irrelevant.''
</P>
<P>
   When Michaels joined the staff as a reporter in 1954,
circulation was around 325,000, according to a Forbes spokeswoman.
In June 1998, the biweekly Forbes had an average paid circulation
of 784,220, according to the most recent figures from the Audit
Bureau of Circulation. In the last year, ad pages were down
slightly, 3,016 pages in the first nine months of 1997 to 3,002 in
the same period in 1998, but annual ad revenue rose 5.2 percent, to
$165 million, from $157 million, according to estimates by the
Publishers Information Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin, who has pushed for more reporting on technology and
telecommunications, became managing editor last year. Before that,
he served as executive editor for five years.
</P>
<P>
   In quintessential Michaels style, Michaels spent much of
Wednesday afternoon editing and rewriting the news release
announcing his move.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to make sure it sounded like Forbes,'' he said,
``and not like your typical press release.''

   POLL-CLINTON (Undated) Despite revelations in the Monica
Lewinsky affair, only a third of Washington voters feel that
Congress should impeach President Clinton while a solid if reduced
majority continue to approve of Clinton's performance in office. A
statewide poll of 810 Washington citizens, all of them regular
voters, found that a combined total of 64 percent felt that
Congress should either censure Clinton or drop the investigation
entirely. ``The bottom line is we are not seeing an increase in the
number of people who would remove Clinton from office . . . These
are almost the same numbers I am getting in New York, Maryland and
Arkansas,'' said Del Ali, president of Mason-Dixon Political/Media
Research, which conducted the poll.

Justice Department officials would not elaborate on what type of
punishment they expect to seek, but outside observers said the
possibilities could include anything from requiring government
pre-approval of Microsoft contracts and products to requiring a
breakup of the company.

CLINTON-PASTOR (Washington) - Ed Pastor, Arizona's sole Democrat in
Congress and considered a safe seat, announced Wednesday that he
will vote for a limited inquiry to impeach President Clinton.
Pastor's position reflects that of the Democratic leadership's new
strategy. Because they know they cannot stop the Republican drive
for an open-ended inquiry, they are fighting for an alternative
that would confine the impeachment inquiry to the Starr report on
the Lewinsky matter. The same leaders are prodding the White House
to drop its opposition, too. So it now appears that the vote today
(Thursday) will probably authorize a long, detailed examination of
everything Clinton has ever been accused of, with no time limits.

REPS. PELOSI, CARDIN CRITICIZE CLINTON INQUIRY AS UNFAIR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On the eve of Thursday's House vote on whether to
begin a probe that could lead to President Clinton's impeachment,
two Democratic lawmakers called the process unfair compared with
the ethics inquiry they helped conduct on charges against House
Speaker Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   Reps. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Benjamin L. Cardin, D-Md., who
sat on the eight-member panel that in 1997 fined Gingrich $300,000
for ethics violations, said in a news conference Wednesday that the
investigation of the speaker was much fairer than the one of
Clinton by Independent Counsel Kenneth W. Starr and the House
Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi said the difference was that the House ethics panel
``worked on a presumption of innocence and tried to look at both
sides'' and the current probe of Clinton is not doing that.
</P>
<P>
   The ethics subcommittee investigating Gingrich also was charged
with examining ``a very slim charge against the speaker'' _ whether
he violated tax laws on nonprofit organizations that funded a
college course he taught and a TV workshop he held _ compared with
``the fishing expedition that has been out there against Clinton,''
Pelosi said.
</P>
<P>
   She said the panel investigating Gingrich also shared its
evidence with the speaker and his lawyers before releasing it to
the public in order to give him a chance to respond, whereas the
president was simply told when a load of boxes with evidence had
arrived on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi also said that during the panel's investigation of
Gingrich the evidence against him was sealed and there were no
leaks during the investigation. In the Clinton case, she said, a
huge volume of information on Clinton has been widely leaked and
released in ``a helter-skelter form.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardin said the Gingrich investigation was bipartisan while in
the Clinton investigation ``there has been no effort, none at all
to bring out a bipartisan process.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the Gingrich inquiry was seen as impartial and
bipartisan, the fine and reprimand against him were widely accepted
as fair, Cardin said, adding tht he is ``fearful the Judiciary
Committee has missed an opportunity to do it right.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been no effort by Republicans to engage the
Democrats in a proper process,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi and Cardin said they intend to vote Thursday against the
Republican proposal to conduct an open-ended investigation of
Clinton. Two dozen or more Democrats are expected to vote for the
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not think these charges rise to the level of an
impeachable offense,'' Pelosi said. ``This isn't about protecting
the president. This is about protecting the Constitution.''

SOME `BLUE DOG DEMOCRATS' ARE LIKELY TO SUPPORT GOP INQUIRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Republicans are counting on some ``Blue Dog
Democrats'' to support the GOP impeachment resolution Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Dogs are conservatives from swing districts in the
South, the Midwest and the West. Some face tough re-election
battles Nov. 3 while others, though unopposed or up against token
opposition, worry that any impeachment-related vote favoring
President Clinton might come back to haunt them.
</P>
<P>
   With a 228-206 GOP majority, it's a foregone conclusion that the
House will approve the Republican-sponsored inquiry into Clinton's
conduct in the White House sex scandal and its aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   But the more Democratic votes the GOP gains, the easier it is
for Republicans to cast the impeachment inquiry in a bipartisan
light. The fewer the Democratic votes, the easier it is for Clinton
and party loyalists on Capitol Hill to cast it as a partisan witch
hunt.
</P>
<P>
   Among Democrats either committed or likely to vote for the
Republican resolution are Rep. Charles Stenholm of Texas, Rep. Jim
Turner of Texas, Rep. Gene Taylor of Mississippi, Rep. Chris John
of Louisiana, Rep. Tim Roemer of Indiana, Rep. Jim Moran of
Virginia, Rep. Paul McHale of Pennsylvania, Rep. Virgil Goode of
Virginia, Rep. William Lipinski of Illinois and Rep. Owen Pickett
of Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Of those, Stenholm, Turner, Taylor, John, Goode, Lipinski and
Pickett are members of the Blue Dog Coalition, formed in 1995 as a
vehicle for conservative Democrats who favored a balanced budget.
With 24 members, the coalition's name is a variation on the
traditional Southern ``yellow dog'' Democrat, a party loyalist who
would even vote for a yellow dog if it were running as a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   The group cast itself as Blue Dogs because they claimed that
liberals in the party had ``choked off'' their conservative
viewpoint.
</P>
<P>
   Stenholm and Turner both face staunch Republican opposition in
the Nov. 3 election.
</P>
<P>
   Another Blue Dog, Rep. Gary Condit, D-Calif., said he too was
``leaning toward support'' of the Republican measure, but wanted to
see what, if any, conditions the Republicans attached to it. ``I
think several members in our group are going to support it.''
</P>
<P>
   For Democrats in tight races, said Democratic consultant Celinda
Lake, ``the question is how to get back to the business of the
country. Some Democrats will say the best way to do that is vote
for the inquiry.''
</P>
<P>
   Estimates of Democratic defections varied Wednesday as members
pondered an alternate Democratic resolution that would set a
deadline for the inquiry and limit the inquiry to Clinton's affair
with Monica Lewinsky. A similar Democratic alternative went down to
defeat Monday on a party-line vote in the Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Several wavering Democrats said they would vote for the
Democratic alternative, but did not foreclose voting for the GOP
resolution when, as expected, the Democratic version is defeated.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ellen Tauscher, D-Calif., a member of the Blue Dogs, said
that while she intended to vote for the Democratic measure, she
would keep her options open when it fails. ``I'm not going to be
painted into a corner'' by Republicans who she felt would
characterize her vote as being against an impeachment inquiry, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Tauscher said Republicans have been ``enormously unfair in their
inability to come to any kind of consensus'' with Democrats. But
ultimately, she added, ``we have to do the right thing by the
Constitution to make sure we are being thoughtful and sober about
deliberations.''
</P>
<P>
   A second possible source of Democratic support for the
Republican resolution is the New Democratic Coalition, formed in
1996 to rally moderate Democrats mostly in suburban swing
districts.
</P>
<P>
   Less conservative than the Blue Dogs, the New Democrat Coalition
is built around support for many of the policies championed by
Clinton: Welfare reform, free trade and encouraging high
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Roemer and Moran are leaders of the 40-member coalition. ``We
know we're going to go forward with an inquiry,'' Moran said
Wednesday, adding that for the 20-to-30 Democrats in tight
re-election bids, the best strategy is to neutralize the issue by
voting for the Republican version.
</P>
<P>
   New Democrats are ``trying to balance the policies with the
politics,'' said Rep. Calvin Dooley, D-Calif., a member of the
coalition, who said he too intended to vote for the Democratic
measure, but would not rule out voting for the Republican version.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither myself nor any member of Congress wants to stand in
the way of a responsible process that can bring this sad chapter in
our country to closure.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   MILAN, Italy _ No one seems to be in the business of subsidizing
creative genius anymore, a situation brought home by the demise
last week of Isaac Mizrahi's business, a tale that is being mourned
and dissected here by designers, editors and retailers alike.
</P>
<P>
   What is evident in the wake of Mizrahi's closing of his business
is that designers in their own houses are ships at sea, unable to
surf the choppy fashion waters unless tethered to a bigger boat _
like Tom Ford at Gucci, Narciso Rodriguez at LVMH, John Bartlett at
Byblos and the newcomers Veronique Branquinho and Raf Simons, who
showed their first collection here for Ruffo, a large Italian
leather company.
</P>
<P>
   It is these designers who seem the strongest and are wielding
the greatest influence in fashion, as a group outweighing designers
whose sole profile is as the head of their own house.
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, the chill that was cast by the Mizrahi episode
may well translate into future collections that are sober and
safely wearable, which would be unfortunate. But this season's
collections, created weeks and months ago, slide from galloping
optimism to tortured soulfulness and are an interesting contrast to
the unsettled undercurrents swirling about.
</P>
<P>
   Back when those lines were conceived, Mizrahi was not out of
business, the stock market had not taken a dive, the Asian crisis
had not become a global contagion, the Italian government was not
in danger of collapse and Cher's daughter had not published a book
saying that her mother had at first disapproved of her lesbianism.
</P>
<P>
   Cher is probably the last mother one would expect to disapprove
of Chastity's unconventional behavior. And Cher is the last icon
one would expect Ford to evoke for Gucci, though that is just what
he did.
</P>
<P>
   Ford has brilliantly made over the image of Cher into a sleek,
ersatz hippie _ the message being that there is no need to abandon
materialism to join his hippie club. In fact, a strong regard for
capitalism is virtually a requirement. (By the time we really got
to know her, Cher was too rich to qualify as a hippie, anyway.)
</P>
<P>
   With this collection, for spring 1999, and his spring men's wear
shown earlier this year, Ford has made a sharp turn in the road he
started down when he began reinventing Gucci in 1994. The women's
show broached many of the same themes as his men's wear. A Gucci
woman with cool to spare revels in a man-style gray locker-room
T-shirt, paired with charcoal wool trousers with rhinestones and
sequins.
</P>
<P>
   Ford made tongue-in-chic use of hibiscus prints in loose,
hipster trousers and flirty, ruffled dresses. It is not by accident
that they appear to have been washed on the river rocks of a
Hawaiian spring.
</P>
<P>
   If the influence is Cher _ the models wore bone-straight,
center-part hair _ then one need not be a member of Mensa to figure
out the show's finale. That's right, along came rows of dangling
and draped beaded fringe dresses a la Bob Mackie.
</P>
<P>
   Ford produced an authoritative rendering of the cultural mix
pervading fashion right now. He presented what might be called
multicultural jeans _ pants that combine the Yankee Americana of
faded blue denim, Native American-style brown feathers, South
African Ndebele beading and Indian decorative mirrors.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ford's collection is superbly exuberant, it is too
quirky to offer direction for an entire industry, as he has done
with Gucci in the past. It is hard to imagine pink hibiscus prints
sweeping the nation.
</P>
<P>
   But this is not a moment to find heroes in fashion. Designers
are still grappling with what comes next after minimalism.
Backward-looking references, like some on Ford's runway, may not be
the answer.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, in his own signature collection (he also designs
LVMH's Loewe line), approaches the problem by wrestling with the
here and now. Melding ideas from his two previous collections, he
played with the proportions of the waistline, elongating the torso
with tube tops and cummerbunds slipped over dresses and jackets.
Here a woman's waist defines her femininity.
</P>
<P>
   He showed tube tops of soft knits, slipping them over
form-hugging dresses that brushed the knee. Structured versions of
the tube tops, extending to the hips, elongated the torso and added
interest.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez's collars are hardly collars at all, more like soft
wings of fabric, which frame the deep decolletages on simple tunic
tops and effortless dresses. The designer has a pleasingly light
hand, applying just a whisper of the rustic in textured linens and
colorless nubby knit tops and dresses. He cares not one whit about
separating clothes into night and day attire, offering in the same
outfit ideas that apply to both _ dresses with gold metallic
textures and white knits, or white sheer knit tanks and glistening,
oil-black cigarette trousers.
</P>
<P>
   At Byblos, Bartlett has yet to hit the stride he's attained in
his own signature collections, but that has not prevented him from
making a good impression with loose, nubile shapes that free the
body for movement and relaxation.
</P>
<P>
   Skimming tunics patterned after djellabas were paired with
loose, cropped pajama pants. He added the crispness of a suit to
khaki shirts by imbuing the shirts with the military air of
epaulettes backed with a flash of orange. Bandeaux, in tie-dyed
knits or in leather, reflected desert vegetation in brown and mossy
green.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There is an approachability that Bartlett is mastering for
Byblos, in contrast to his own collection, which has more in common
with the menace of the work of Ms. Branquinho and Simons, two of
the more celebrated young talents in fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Branquinho designed the women's wear and Simons the men's
collection for Ruffo Research. Invoking their Goth oeuvre, which
has drawn attention to their own individual collections, these
designers, who are also a couple, showed a concise and masterful
collection of leather bomber jackets, with exquisite plisse detail
at the waist and cuffs. There were also luxurious full black
leather skirts that swept the floor and were decorated with panels
of latticework.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to Ms. Branquinho's and Simon's individualist work
is the industrialism of Max Mara. One nice idea here was the
underslip of brilliantly colored jersey that winked through side
slits on khaki skirts and dresses. But longtime fashion editors and
retailers have a saying: there's something good to be found in
every collection, no matter how disappointing. Far too many shows,
including those of Alessandro Dell'Acqua, Ferragamo, Anna Molinari,
Moschino, Bottega Veneta and Jan &AMP; Carlos, earned this faint
praise.
</P>
<P>
   From the parade of Mao worker jackets with frog closures and
cheongsam dresses at Ferragamo to the indiscriminate layering of
tulle and other sheer fabrics over trousers and skirts at Anna
Molinari, many designers in Milan had a story's worth of ideas, but
they had lost the plot.
</P>
<P>
   When Laura Moltedo, Manuela Morin and Edward Buchanan, an
American, came out to take their bow at the end of the Bottega
Veneta show, it was perplexing to imagine that it took three
designers to come up with this banal mix of cotton skirts and
dresses tied at the bosom like bath towels. It was disappointing
because the house has recently made great leaps in updating its
accessories and developing its ready-to-wear.
</P>
<P>
   Dell'Acqua, invoking the theme of a ``white widow,'' the
colloquial Italian term for a woman left behind when her husband
goes to war, tried hard and succeeded with beautiful full skirts
decorated with flat seams, and a sheer black skirt with ruffles
that formed chevrons down the front and back. He suggested the
doleful sexiness of a young bride torn between a husband who may
never return and her all-too-human needs. But however appealing
this idea, it often dissolved into design melodrama, like drapes of
pleated chiffon that hung from the backs of blouses, and a short
ecru pleated tabard over a black chiffon shirt.
</P>
<P>
   The earnestness of designers in Milan is palpable. Everyone
seems to be looking around, trying to figure out what's next as the
millennium approaches and economic uncertainty looms. The easiest
path would be to shackle every collection to a tried-and-true
blazer. Would that have saved Mizrahi? Several designers are at
least taking the higher road into the next century, trying
inventive cuts, abstraction in color and shape, a melding of the
artisinal and the industrial, the modern and the folkway. It makes
for a fluid moment in fashion with a surfeit of collections that
few women would die for, but in each one is some point of interest
to commend it.

CLINTON BOWS TO DEMOCRATS VOTING FOR IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton abruptly abandoned efforts
Wednesday to recruit House Democrats for the showdown over a House
impeachment inquiry, publicly freeing his allies to support an
open-ended investigation a month before the midterm congressional
elections.
</P>
<P>
   White House aides said the president hoped his recommendation
for the 206 Democrats in the 435-seat House to ``cast a vote of
principle and conscience'' would bolster Democrats' chances with
voters on Nov. 3, helping them return to Capitol Hill in strength
for the next phase of the impeachment struggle.
</P>
<P>
   The president _ along with First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton,
White House Press Secretary Joe Lockhart and Rep. Vic Fazio,
D-Calif., the third ranking Democrat in the House _ underscored the
administration's decision to release House Democrats to vote for
the wider impeachment inquiry favored by the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican-led House is scheduled to vote Thursday on a
recommendation by the House Judiciary Committee to open a
wide-ranging impeachment inquiry into Clinton's conduct during his
presidency. The Judiciary Committee voted 21-16 along party lines
Monday to launch a broad investigation into the president's actions
in the Monica Lewinsky affair and other activities during his
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said the coordinated White House message is that the
president and his aides will continue to work with any House
Democrats ``who for whatever reason decide to vote to move forward
under the proposal put forward by the Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Democratic insiders estimate that between 40 and 60 House
Democrats may support the GOP-backed proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had been quietly trying to coax Democrats to vote as a
bloc against the open-ended impeachment inquiry, enabling the White
House to portray the investigation as a partisan venture.
</P>
<P>
   But the White House abandoned the approach on Wednesday in the
face of complaints from some House Democrats that they need to vote
for the inquiry in order to survive the November election.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody should cast a vote of principle and
conscience,'' Clinton told a photo session in the Oval Office with
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton told 25 first-term House Democrats at a separate
gathering inside the White House that ``we know that you have to be
able to defend your position.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart, relaying Mrs. Clinton's remarks, said the first lady
``made the explicit point that this White House stands ready to
work with Democrats and support Democrats, help them get elected,
work into the future, no matter how they vote,'' Lockhart added.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is not trying to speak to House
Democrats ``in code,'' Lockhart said, adding: ``I think members
understand what we're saying. And if others don't, I don't think I
can explain it any further.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton signaled that he has shifted his gaze beyond the House
vote to bolstering his fortunes in the fall election.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens to me, I think, ultimately will be for the
American people to decide,'' Clinton said during the Oval Office
photo session. `` I owe them my best efforts to work for them, and
that's what I am going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Fazio, the chief vote counter for House Democrats, consulted
with Clinton at the White House. Fazio tried to dim the spotlight
on the House's expected approval of an impeachment inquiry _ only
the third time in American history that the House will have
launched an impeachment investigation of a sitting president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think tomorrow's vote is a question that members are having
to respond to in the context of an election,'' Fazio said. ``The
vote that comes next is far more important than simply teeing up
this investigation, which is really what we're talking about
tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic strategists are banking that their candidates, by
focusing on issues that affect the daily lives of Americans, can
stem the traditional losses suffered in the sixth year of the
presidency by the party that holds the White House.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spotlighted the approach again on Wednesday by signing a
higher education package that cuts the interest rates of college
student loans to the lowest level in 17 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the way America should work; this is the way Congress
should work,'' Clinton told a bipartisan of lawmakers in the East
Room of the White House. ``We put the progress of the country and
the people of the country ahead of our partisan differences and
reached a principled resolution of the matters in dispute.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are hoping to broaden the bipartisan complexion of
the 363 to 63 vote on Sept. 11 to release material from special
prosecutor Kenneth Starr's report of potentially impeachable
offenses by Clinton. The House has 228 Republicans, 206 Democrats
and one independent who usually votes with the Democrats.

 &HT;    National campaign ad targets Clinton
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Washington _ A liberal tax-exempt group here has launched the
first national ad campaign of the 1998 elections aimed at tapping
into potential voter backlash over impeachment proceedings against
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   People for the American Way, a left wing counter-point to the
Christian Coalition, began airing the ad in California, Illinois,
New Mexico, Nevada and Florida on Wednesday after a national debut
on CNN's ``Larry King Live'' Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The ad features mug shots of Independent Counsel Ken Starr,
House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) and Christian Coalition founder
Pat Robertson and the voice of Carole Shields, president of People
for the American Way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's move on,'' Shields says in the ad. ``That's what the
American people are saying loud and clear. But some in Washington
are listening to the religious right -- not the people...It's time
to get back to what really counts. First-rate schools, Medicare and
social security, not just for our parents for them too. We have a
voice and a vote. November 3 is election day. Let's tell them it's
time to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   The $1 million ad campaign comes as the House of Representatives
is scheduled to vote today on opening a formal impeachment inquiry
into Clinton's affair with one-time White House intern Monica
Lewinsky and his efforts to conceal the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Shields said in an interview that impeachment was ``sucking the
oxygen out of issues that people care about,'' such as the patients
bill of rights and funding for education.
</P>
<P>
   The main goal of the ad is to increase turnout among voters
opposed to the religious right, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they are the only people voting, they are going to set the
agenda,'' she said. ``The good guys have to show up.''
</P>
<P>
   Genevieve Wood, a spokeswoman for the Republican National
Committee (RNC), said the ads were ``offensive to people of
faith.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, they are trying to stir up their base,'' Wood said.
</P>
<P>
   The organization's campaign initially ignited some criticism
from some Democrats, who accused the White House of attempting to
orchestrate the effort to help the president at the expense of
House and Senate candidates who needed the support.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats worried that a coordinated get-out-the-vote
campaign centered around Clinton's problems could siphon money away
from congressional races.
</P>
<P>
   Shields said the White House was never involved in her
organization's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   While publicly critical, no Democrats called the group to
complain directly about the ad campaign, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1980 by television producer Norman Lear, People for
the American Way boasts some 300,000 members.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the top financial contributors are from Hollywood and
active in Democratic politics. Actors Alec Baldwin, Kim Basinger
and Kathleen Turner are all top contributors.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Podesta, a member of the board of directors, is the
brother of John Podesta, Clinton's deputy chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   The group has been one of the most vocal critics of the
Christian Coalition, publishing an on-line newsletter called
``Right Wing Watch Online.''
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago, the organization delivered a report to the
Internal Revenue Service charging the Christian Coalition with
violating its IRS tax-exemption.
</P>
<P>
   People for the American Way is itself a tax-exempt, operating a
501(c)(3) foundation that collects tax-deductible contributions and
a 501(c)(4) social welfare organization engaged in lobbying.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the group also started a political action committee
(PAC) that endorsed 45 congressional candidates _ all but three
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Though the group's new ad does not tell listeners to vote for
any candidate in particular, the media markets chosen for them
cover many of the districts of candidates whom the group has
endorsed.
</P>
<P>
   Ads running in Moline, Ill., for example, will reach voters in
incumbent Rep. Lane Evans' western Illinois district, where Evans
is locked in a tough re-election fight.
</P>
<P>
   The ads are running in two California markets, where the group
has endorsed 7 Democrats for House and Sen. Barbara Boxer
(D-Calif.), who is fending off a stiff challenge from California
Treasurer Matt Fong.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Lux, director of the organization's PAC, said the ads were
not running in Washington state or Wisconsin because the group is
providing direct support to Democratic candidates there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are doing our best to play by the rules,'' Lux said. ``We
take a very conservative interpretation of election law.''

PROTEST RALLY MORE A CALL FOR PEACE, ORDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ It took over six hours, and a lot of beer, before the
thing that Russians feared would happen during a nationwide protest
finally happened.
</P>
<P>
   But by the time police and demonstrators clashed Wednesday
evening in the Russian capital, it looked less like a revolutionary
uprising than an unruly crowd of several hundred young people being
cleared off the street in typically brusque fashion by Moscow's
finest.
</P>
<P>
   Thus ended a day of protest that drew hundreds of thousands
across the country. It was bound to have disappointed Communist and
labor union leaders, who had promised that as many as 40 million
Russians would turn out to demand better living standards and the
resignation of President Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the people whose 20th Century was defined by revolution
chose to stay home in a resonant plea for peace and stability. That
seemed to echo the message of some of the tens of thousands of
Muscovites _ police put the number at around 50,000, while
organizers estimated turnout at 150,000 _ who gathered at the walls
of the Kremlin Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is a normal life. We see how people live in the West,
and we want to live like that,'' said protester Vyacheslav Makarov
as he marched under a sign that made a vulgar pun on Yeltsin's
name.
</P>
<P>
   Others were less prone to conversation with American reporters.
One group of about 30 tough-looking men in camouflage uniforms
sullenly marched by, refusing to identify themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the union of killers!'' one of the men snarled.
``Shouldn't you think about leaving?''
</P>
<P>
   But the mood was surprisingly peaceful in Moscow and throughout
the country, despite a deep economic crisis that has brought a new
bout of inflation and a rapid drop in living standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one wants to die,'' commented a police lieutenant colonel
watching the Moscow protest with a group of officers. ``Everyone is
tired of protesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Although there were plenty of red flags, portraits of Lenin and
Stalin, and angry, sometimes anti-Semitic slogans _ typical of all
anti-government protests since the 1991 breakup of the Soviet Union
_ Wednesday's rally behind St. Basil's Cathedral featured no
speeches by opposition leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Russian Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov, spent the day
as a rank-and-file protestor, except that he was surrounded by
several stern bodyguards, and did not attempt to address the crowd.
Viktor Anpilov, the head of a radical Communist splinter group
whose fiery oratory has been a fixture at protests, Wednesday
arrived late and was not allowed on the platform.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, a tape recording droned out slogans like ``Salaries!
Employment! Legality!'' and a series of labor union leaders and
Moscow city officials called for Yeltsin to step down. Some heaped
praise on the city's populist mayor, Yury Luzhkov, who has
indicated he will run for president in the next elections,
scheduled in two years.
</P>
<P>
   Luzhkov himself stayed away from the protests, but one of his
likely opponents, retired Gen. Alexander Lebed, led a protest march
in Krasnoyarsk, the capital of the massive Siberian territory where
he is governor. Another governor once viewed by Yeltsin as a
possible successor, Dmitry Ayatskov of the Volga region of Saratov,
told a crowd it was ``time to send Yeltsin into retirement.''
</P>
<P>
   A Yeltsin spokesman said the Russian leader, who spent the day
in Kremlin office but did not make any statements, had ``a
disappointed reaction'' to the calls for him to step down. A top
aide, Oleg Sysuyev, said Yeltsin, who he said was able to watch the
rally thanks to special surveillance cameras set up on the square
by the authorities, had no plans to go anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   As the rally outside St. Basil's began to break up after sunset,
about 1,000 protesters, mainly young people, said they were not
going to budge either. A young man in a Nike swoosh hat threatened
a young police officer with a red flag. A group of young men in
leather jackets drank beer and yelled ``Yeltsin is a killer!''
Police told the crowd to get off the square. A cordon pushed, the
crowd pushed back. Someone waved a Confederate flag. The police
pushed some more, prompting more cries of ``Yeltsin is a killer.''
In the ensuing scuffle some 40 people were arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Several minutes later it was over, the crowd went home and water
trucks came to wash away the last signs of protest from the square.

IDEALS MAY DECIDE THE PRESIDENT'S FATE  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADAM PERTMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the end, President Clinton's fate may rest on this question:
Should the occupant of the Oval Office be judged by tougher rules
than the rest of us?
</P>
<P>
   David P. Schippers, the Republican majority's chief counsel on
the House Judiciary Committee, framed the panel's hearings this
week by answering with an unqualified yes. The president, Schippers
asserted, is, ``by virtue of his office, held to a higher standard
than any other American.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a statement that rang true to many Clinton defenders and
detractors alike, according to legal scholars and political
historians, largely because most people tend to _ or at least want
to _ idealize the presidency, and to view the holder of the office
as a role model.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the specialists, however, sharply disagreed with the
substance of Schippers' assertion. They said it seemed to stem more
from a partisan political climate and personal moral outrage than
from a historical or legal precedent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's ridiculous; it's certainly not grounded in
constitutional doctrine,'' said Judy Olans-Brown, a Northeastern
University Law School professor. ``It sounds to me like he was more
motivated by disgust about the obviously self-indulgent, adolescent
behavior of our president.''
</P>
<P>
   Irwin Hargrove, a presidential historian at Vanderbilt
University and a harsh critic of Clinton, said the Republicans in
Congress _ through Schippers' comments Monday _ were ``trying to
make the best argument they can'' in the face of ``evidence that
doesn't necessarily rise to the level'' of the two previous efforts
to impeach a president, against Richard M. Nixon in 1974 and Andrew
Johnson in 1868.
</P>
<P>
   ``Impeachment has to be concrete,'' said Hargrove, who added
that many who would jettison Clinton are driven by disapproval of
his personal behavior. ``There can't be a sliding legal or moral
scale. ... The Constitution wasn't created for a moral witch
hunt.''
</P>
<P>
   While most of those interviewed suggested that Schippers had
overreached, they also agreed that the majority counsel's
rhetorical formula would have little bearing on the ultimate issue,
whether the president did or did not commit impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   In Clinton's various legal controversies, federal judges
straight up to the Supreme Court have ruled, in effect, that the
president does not enjoy special legal status. Most notably, the
courts have held that he is not immune from civil suits while in
office, that he could not invoke executive privilege to keep the
special prosecutor's office from questioning his closest advisers,
and that he could not keep Secret Service agents from testifying
because their job was to protect the president.
</P>
<P>
   Some scholars went further and echoed Schippers' view that the
president should indeed be held to a higher standard.
</P>
<P>
   That is because politicians serve as highly visible models by
which public standards are set, and when they stray, they should be
held to account more strictly, said Todd Gaziano, a senior fellow
in legal studies at the Washington-based Heritage Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Gaziano also said that the president should be judged
differently because he is the only American who takes an oath of
office in which he vows to make sure the nation's laws are
``faithfully executed'' under the Constitution. ``So when he
violates the law ... he also violates his constitutional duty,''
Gaziano said.
</P>
<P>
   The framers of the Constitution specified a different standard
for removing officials of the judiciary. In addition to ``high
crimes and misdemeanors,'' judges can be impeached if they are
deemed to have violated ``good behavior'' while in office, a phrase
that is similarly vague.
</P>
<P>
   Scholars say America's founders deliberately did not specify
which crimes or misdeeds should constitute sufficient cause for
impeachment. They recognized that standards would evolve, and
evidently accepted that political judgments would always play an
important role in the process, for better or worse.
</P>
<P>
   That was the case in both previous impeachment-related
processes, although experts asserted that the Watergate episode _
while including partisan posturing aplenty _ represented the
clearest example of a president's breaking laws while in office.
Andrew Johnson, on the other hand, came within a vote of losing his
job because of overtly political disagreements with the Republicans
who then controlled the House.
</P>
<P>
   The current debate contains aspects of both precedents. And,
despite public cynicism about politics, it reflects the underlying
desire among many Americans that the occupant of the White House be
a role model, as well as a leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people look at the office as very much set by the
greats of the past, so they do have an elevated feeling about the
presidency,'' said James McGregor Burns, a presidential historian
who is working on a book about Clinton. ``But how you convert that
into any legal aspect, whether he should be held to a higher or
different standard, is very much influenced by what's going on at
the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the risk that partisanship can drive an impeachment
effort, even if it means manipulating the standards by which a
president is judged, none of the historians or political scientists
suggested that Congress should draft definitive circumstances under
which impeachment can take place.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats on the Judiciary Committee tried and failed to
establish such guidelines for Clinton, just as Republicans sought
and failed to do so for Nixon a quarter-century ago.
</P>
<P>
   To establish specifics, experts said, could create long-term
institutional problems that would outlive any single dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Gilbert, author of ``The Mortal Presidency,'' said it
would take Congress ``until the end of time if it tried to
enumerate what high standards a president was supposed to live up
to.'' If they did accomplish the task, he added, it would upset the
constitutional balance of powers by giving Congress a winning card
that it could play against the executive branch at its discretion.

REPORTS QUESTION VALUE OF CHIROPRACTIC CARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY TYE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chiropractors are no more effective than physical therapists in
treating lower back pain, and both are only marginally successful
at easing their patients' symptoms, according to a controversial
new study published Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A second report out Thursday on chiropractic care is even more
discouraging, although it affects far fewer patients: spinal
manipulation, researchers concluded, provides ``no benefit'' for
children with mild or moderate asthma.
</P>
<P>
   The two studies are fueling an already fiery debate about the
value of complementary medical treatments like chiropractics, and
about whether it is fair for traditional medical doctors to judge
alternative practitioners. The reports are also drawing charges
from the chiropractic community that the findings were skewed by
the design of the studies, especially the one on lower back pain,
and that they should never have been published in the prestigious
New England Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look overall at why people go to chiropractors,
slightly over half are for back pain. This is at the heart of what
chiropractors do, and these data suggest there probably is some
benefit _ but on average it's relatively small and comparable to
physical therapy,'' said Dr. Richard A. Deyo, a professor of
medicine at the University of Washington and an author of the study
on lower back pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think chiropractors will be disappointed we didn't
demonstrate bigger effects, or saving money in the long run, or
bigger benefits in getting people back to work faster.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerome F. McAndrews, spokesman for the American Chiropractic
Association, not only was disappointed, he also was angry. He said
the journal study failed to recognize that chiropractors generally
combine stretching and other therapies with their spinal
manipulation, rather than doing manipulation alone. The study also
excluded patients that McAndrews said are commonly and effectively
treated by chiropractors, including pregnant women and people who
had back surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am surprised really that this rose to the level of
warranting publication in the New England Journal,'' McAndrews
concluded. ``It's highly limited. It's like a lot of research, it
just has failings and the utility of the outcomes is highly
questionable.''
</P>
<P>
   The two reports come at a time when many within conventional and
complementary medicine are looking for common ground and ways to
make their divergent approaches less confusing to patients. But
some traditional doctors think the bridging of gaps has gone too
far by holding alternative medicine to less rigorous scientific
standards than conventional care. And the articles come less than a
month after editors of the New England Journal leveled a broadside
against alternative remedies, charging that they sometimes reflect
``a reversion to irrational approaches to medical practice.''
</P>
<P>
   The study on lower back pain involved 321 adults whose pain
persisted for seven days after visiting a primary care doctor, and
who had never before had physical therapy or chiropractic care.
Forty percent were randomly assigned to a month of physical therapy
with the common McKenzie method that uses stretching and other
exercises to steer pain from the feet, legs or buttocks to the
lower back. Another 40 percent got a month of chiropractic
manipulations of the spine. The remainder simply received a booklet
discussing causes of back pain and ways to treat it.
</P>
<P>
   All patients were followed for two years, at which point
researchers compared short and long-term results of the three
treatment approaches. Those getting chiropractic care reported
remarkably similar results to those getting physical therapy on
everything from symptoms to function to recurrence of pain. In both
cases patients had ``only marginally better outcomes than those
receiving the minimal intervention of an educational booklet,'' the
authors reported. And in both cases the financial cost of care was
almost three times higher than with the booklet group.
</P>
<P>
   There was one measure on which chiropractic and physical therapy
patients scored much higher than the booklet group: patient
satisfaction. About 75 percent of those who got the extra
treatments rated their care ``very good'' or ``excellent,''
compared to just 30 percent of those who got just a booklet.
</P>
<P>
   In the asthma study, 91 children who were getting medical
treatment but had continuing symptoms were randomly assigned to two
groups, one of which got actual spinal manipulation while the other
visited a chiropractor but just went through the motions of
treatment without having their spine adjusted. The results: both
groups showed a substantial reduction in symptoms and the need for
medication, as well as an improvement in quality of life.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that both groups improved is encouraging, but it also
makes clear that spinal manipulation could not have been the
reason, said Dr. Jeffrey Balon, the lead author of the study who is
trained both as a medical doctor and chiropractor and who did his
research at the Canadian Memorial Chiropractic College in Toronto.
The two groups may have done better, he added, simply because they
were reassured by taking part in the study and getting extra
professional attention.
</P>
<P>
   Because the use of chiropractics to treat asthma is far more
common in other countries than in America, it is the back pain
study that is drawing the loudest reaction here, especially among
America's 55,000 chiropractors.
</P>
<P>
   McAndrews, whose group is the largest representing US
chiropractors, said even though his members focus on the
musculoskeletal system they are trained to medically evaluate the
whole patient. And he said his fellow chiropractors welcome more
rigorous studies of their work, although he worried that the study
on back pain was flawed in design while the one on asthma
contradicts decades of clinical observations that spinal
manipulation does help asthmatic children.
</P>
<P>
   McAndrews also worried about what he said was a ``chilling''
backlash against chiropractors and other complementary
practitioners by managed care plans and conventional medical
doctors.
</P>
<P>
   An editorial in the New England Journal, by Dr. Paul G. Shekelle
of the West Los Angeles Veterans Affairs Medical Center, sought to
carve out a middle ground between chiropractors and their critics.
``It is currently inappropriate to consider chiropractic as a
broad-based alternative to traditional medical care,'' he wrote.
``However, for some musculoskeletal conditions, chiropractic care
does provide some benefit to some patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge for chiropractors is to demonstrate that they
can achieve this benefit at a cost that patients or health insurers
are willing to bear.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   In the summer of 1995, a whiff of revolution was in the air in
Silicon Valley. The Internet offered a new deal in computing, a
fresh opportunity for entrepreneurs to try to break Microsoft
Corp.'s firm grip on the personal computer software business.
Leading the challenge was Netscape Communications Corp., whose
software for browsing the World Wide Web had ignited the Internet
boom.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape chairman James Clark spoke boldly of attacking
Microsoft head-on. He borrowed imagery from the movie ``Star
Wars,'' referring to Microsoft as the Death Star and Netscape as
the leader of a rebel alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft answered with a vengeance. It dispatched hundreds of
programmers to work on a competing browser and poured many millions
of dollars into marketing it. It prodded computer makers and others
to distribute its browser, folded the browser into its
industry-dominant Windows operating system and gave the browser
away free _ a campaign intended to ``cut off their air supply,'' as
a senior Microsoft executive described it.
</P>
<P>
   But not only competitors like Netscape have encountered
Microsoft's force. Microsoft's partners, its corporate customers
and professional investors who finance new ventures have all
collided with it.
</P>
<P>
   A close look at Microsoft's no-holds-barred push into the
Internet software business offers a window into the ways the
company uses its market muscle to influence the behavior of
virtually every player in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the cases recounted here figure prominently in the suit
brought by the Justice Department and 20 states, scheduled to go to
trial this month, charging that Microsoft at times went too far _
and violated antitrust laws. Regardless of the legal outcome,
previously unreported details about incidents in the suit and the
other examples provide a more complete picture of Microsoft in
action.
</P>
<P>
   _ When Compaq Computer Corp. considered loading Netscape's
browser instead of Microsoft's on its personal computers, Microsoft
threatened to stop selling its Windows operating system to Compaq.
The company quickly changed its mind.
</P>
<P>
   _ After Spyglass Inc. began supplying Microsoft with its early
browser technology, Microsoft announced that it would give away its
browser free. The timing came as a rude surprise to its partner
Spyglass. The company lost most of its revenues almost overnight,
as the technology, which it had also been licensing to companies
besides Microsoft, suddenly became available free.
</P>
<P>
   _ When America Online Inc., which competes fiercely with
Microsoft's online service and electronic commerce divisions, went
shopping for browser technology, Microsoft made an offer that was
too good to pass up: If America Online used Microsoft's browser as
the main one for its millions of subscribers, Microsoft would give
America Online prime placement on the desktop screen of all
personal computers using Windows.
</P>
<P>
   _ When Intel Corp. began developing its own Internet software,
Microsoft complained. Intel, the leading maker of the
microprocessors that serve as the electronic brains on most
personal computers running Windows, pulled back. The chip maker
decided that its lucrative hand-in-glove partnership with Microsoft
took priority.
</P>
<P>
   _ Microsoft's reach in computing has become so pervasive that
nearly every year now, Silicon Valley's top venture capitalists
meet privately with a team of top Microsoft executives to learn
about the company's plans. The goal, one venture investor observed,
was to ``stay out of the way of the steamroller.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft adamantly denies that it has broken any laws in these
or similar situations. The company plays the game of business hard,
and its executives acknowledge that without apology. Yes, Microsoft
says, rivals may suffer and partners may be irritated occasionally.
But the company insists its actions are guided by its main
corporate goal of bringing new technology inexpensively and
conveniently to the millions of people who use its software.
</P>
<P>
   Most people in the computer industry say that living in
Microsoft's world means routinely making accommodations to it.
Microsoft's power emanates from its near-monopoly on the market for
personal computer operating systems, the master control programs
that run computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because it owns the operating system, Microsoft is the
essential utility of the information age,'' said James Moore,
president of Geopartners Research Inc., a technology consulting
firm. ``It acts as a kind of gatekeeper to the pipeline of
computing innovation, sitting there and deciding whether to help
some innovation or slow it down.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   THE MEETING: Offer Declined, And War Begins  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For months, Microsoft and Netscape had talked on and off,
circling each other warily. But the event that would define them as
unflinching rivals was a meeting on June 21, 1995, in a
second-floor conference room at Netscape's headquarters in Mountain
View, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   That meeting, according to the Justice Department and 20 states
suing Microsoft, was the high-tech equivalent of the storied
gatherings in smoke-filled railroad cars that inspired passage of
the nation's antitrust laws a century ago. On that day, they say,
Microsoft made Netscape an illegal offer to divvy up the market for
Internet browsing software, a collusion pact that Netscape
rejected. Microsoft replies that the prosecutors are
misinterpreting a routine meeting in the software business and that
the company has never tried to divide the browser market.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Gates, Microsoft's chairman and principal strategist, did
not attend the Mountain View gathering, but he consulted by
telephone with the Microsoft team. Two people who did attend that
June meeting have been named as witnesses in the trial scheduled to
begin next week: Netscape president James Barksdale and Daniel
Rosen, Microsoft's general manager of new technology.
</P>
<P>
   In the trial, the government will contend that Microsoft
presented Netscape with an all-or-nothing offer, according to
people who have been questioned in the federal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Relying heavily on notes taken in the meeting by Netscape
executive vice president Marc Andreessen and on the testimony of
Barksdale, prosecutors are expected to assert that the Microsoft
proposal had several elements, both incentives and requirements.
Microsoft, according to the people questioned by the government,
would invest in Netscape, taking a 15 to 20 percent stake, give
Netscape technical information and fine-tune Microsoft's operating
systems so that Netscape's software would run better on Windows.
</P>
<P>
   In return, the people say, Netscape would give Microsoft a seat
on its board, license its technology to Microsoft, give Microsoft
advance knowledge of its product-development efforts and not make a
browser for the next generation of the Microsoft operating system,
Windows 95, which was shipped two months after the June 1995
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   And Microsoft, the people added, did what it has always denied
it does _ used access to its technology as a powerful lever in
business negotiations, by offering Netscape preferential access to
the Windows ``application program interfaces,'' or APIs, the links
that enable other companies' programs to run smoothly on the
Windows operating system. By turning down the deal, Netscape, they
say, would not have that preferred access to Microsoft technology _
a threat that Microsoft fiercely denies making.
</P>
<P>
   Barksdale, Netscape's 55-year-old chief executive, told a
colleague that the encounter with Microsoft in June 1995 was ``the
damnedest meeting I've ever attended in 35 years in business.''
</P>
<P>
   Had Netscape accepted Microsoft's offer, it would have had
Microsoft's money and its endorsement. Netscape would have also
been free to sell its browser for use in earlier versions of
Windows and for use on other operating systems like Apple's
Macintosh and Unix, a powerful system used mainly in corporations
and research labs.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if we had licensed our technology to Microsoft and stepped
aside, the best we could have hoped for was becoming a company with
sales of $100 million or so and hoping to be bought out by
Microsoft,'' said Clark, a former computer scientist at Stanford
University who founded Silicon Graphics Inc., a computer graphics
pioneer, before starting Netscape. ``We didn't start Netscape for
that.''
</P>
<P>
   For any company, a meeting with Microsoft is often a charged
affair. Every computing device from keyboards to disk drives, and
every software program from games to browsers, must mesh smoothly
with Microsoft's Windows operating system. This is necessary to
make computers reliable and easier to use, but it also gives
Microsoft its role as the industry's gatekeeper.
</P>
<P>
   And since Microsoft itself makes all manner of software products
beyond the operating system, other companies are put in the uneasy
position of requiring Microsoft's cooperation to be able to compete
against it.
</P>
<P>
   And in the software industry, where every program is rendered in
the digital code of 1's and 0's, the lines that divide competition
and cooperation are often blurred. The talk about that line at the
Microsoft-Netscape meeting focused on the division between the
operating system _ the ``platform,'' in computer terms _ and the
application programs, sometimes called ``solutions,'' that run on
top of the operating system.
</P>
<P>
   The government suit states that in sworn testimony, Chris Jones,
a Microsoft manager who attended the meeting, ``admitted that
Microsoft `absolutely' intended to persuade Netscape not to
compete.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft reads Jones' testimony very differently, as evidence
mainly of the company's clarifying its position. If Netscape stayed
on the applications or solutions side of the operating system, the
two companies could be partners, Microsoft said. But if Netscape
tried to become a player in the platform space, they would compete.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft released portions of the Jones deposition in September
as evidence that the government had quoted the Microsoft manager
out of context.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do you recall any discussion about a desire of anybody on the
part of Microsoft who was participating to be able to persuade or
influence Netscape not to compete?
</P>
<P>
   A. Absolutely. But again, persuade in the sense of force or
persuade in the sense of, hey, we think we can have a great
business relationship together.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the deposition, a Justice Department lawyer asked Jones
whether any of the Microsoft executives intended to suggest that
``there would be any consequences to Netscape or its business if
Netscape chose to go in the platform direction you've described
earlier as opposed to the solutions direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones replied: ``The conversation was something like the
following: `We're in the platform business. We're going to invest
heavily in this part of the platform because we feel it's critical
to our technologies. That's a done deal.' And we're asking them:
`What is your business? Is your business platforms or solutions? If
it's platforms, we're in the platforms business. We're
competing.'''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft portrays such comments as innocuous statements of
fact. But to Netscape, the same remarks could be taken as a
warning, if not a threat. This is because Internet browsing
software had the potential to become an alternative platform to the
Windows operating system. The browser, sitting on top of the
operating system, could supplant Windows as the main desktop screen
on users' machines and the main layer of programming for starting
other software applications.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Netscape's browser could serve as a powerful
platform for distributing and running Java, an Internet programming
language developed by Sun Microsystems Inc., a Microsoft rival.
</P>
<P>
   In technical terms, Netscape's upstart platform could replace
Microsoft's APIs as the essential utility of computing. Indeed,
Andreessen had boasted in public of Netscape's ambition to relegate
Microsoft's Windows to so much software plumbing underneath the
browser.
</P>
<P>
   By the June meeting, Microsoft certainly viewed Netscape as a
serious potential challenger to Windows, the corporate crown jewel.
</P>
<P>
   On May 26, 1995, in an internal memo, ``The Internet Tidal
Wave,'' Gates wrote: ``A new competitor `born' on the Internet is
Netscape. Their browser is dominant with 70 percent usage share,
allowing them to determine which network extensions will catch
on.'' Netscape's strategy, Gates wrote, was to ``move the key API''
into the browser ``to commoditize the underlying operating
system.''

   THE BROADER INQUIRY: GOVERNMENT SEES ARM-TWISTING
</P>
<P>
   The federal government and the states have recently broadened
their allegations against Microsoft by adding evidence that it
tried to bully Intel, Apple Computer Inc. and other companies to
squelch competition.
</P>
<P>
   They say that like the Netscape meeting the new evidence fits a
pattern of behavior by Microsoft, which has repeatedly tried to
limit competition by strong-arming competitors and partners.
</P>
<P>
   One episode that fits the pattern, the prosecutors contend, was
an effort by Microsoft to pressure Intel to shelve the development
of multimedia and Internet software and to limit its cooperation
with Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   Intel's main business is making the microprocessor chips that
act as the electronic brains of most of the computers that run the
Windows operating system. Indeed, the fortunes of Intel and
Microsoft are so closely aligned that the two companies are
sometimes referred to as a single, powerful entity, ``Wintel.''
</P>
<P>
   But Intel also employs hundreds of software engineers, mainly at
its Intel Architecture Labs in Hillsboro, Ore. And while Intel and
Microsoft are partners, they have also had their conflicts,
typically over the direction and pace at which certain innovations
should be introduced into the personal computer industry, which
they dominate together.
</P>
<P>
   Federal and state investigators have focused on Microsoft's
strong reaction to work being done by Intel's software engineers _
a sentiment expressed in no uncertain terms during a meeting at
Intel's Santa Clara, Calif., headquarters on Aug. 2, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The contentious session was attended by several executives from
Intel and Microsoft, including Gates and Intel chairman Andrew
Grove. An internal Intel memo stated that Gates made ``vague
threats'' about supporting Intel's competitors and that he was
``livid'' about Intel's ``investments in the Internet and wanted
them stopped.'' Later, Intel did pull back from its multimedia and
Internet software development. Steven McGeady, an Intel vice
president who attended the August 1995 meeting, is scheduled to
appear as a witness for the government.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft replies that the government's accounts of meetings
like those with Netscape and Intel are fanciful distortions,
created by using a biased selection of documents and witnesses. The
government's case, Microsoft asserts, betrays an utter failure to
accept the computer-industry reality that Microsoft routinely meets
with companies to make sure their software and equipment will work
well with Windows. Sometimes the talks, Microsoft says, go on to
include further levels of cooperation like licensing technology or
a Microsoft investment, as the company discussed with Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   In the trial, Microsoft is expected to argue its advance in the
browser market was the result of its own business acumen and
Netscape's missteps. To document Netscape's errors, Microsoft
issued a subpoena last month and obtained the unpublished
manuscript of a new book, ``Competing on Internet Time: Lessons
From Netscape and Its Battle With Microsoft,'' which is based on
hundreds of interviews with current and former Netscape executives.
</P>
<P>
   The book does chronicle the mistakes made by Netscape. But its
authors, Michael Cusumano of the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology's Sloan School of Management and David Yoffie of the
Harvard Business School, think Microsoft is hardly blameless.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft's take-no-prisoners strategy backfired, all but
inviting retaliation from competitors, the government and even
customers,'' Yoffie said.
</P>
<P>
   Emphasizing that he was offering no legal judgment, Yoffie
added, ``I think Microsoft could have achieved 90 percent of what
it did without crossing the line as much as it did.''
</P>
<P>
   THE SPYGLASS LINK: REWARDS AND PERILS OF A PARTNERSHIP  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On April 6, 1994, Gates and 20 Microsoft executives gathered for
a daylong retreat not far from the company's headquarters in
Redmond, Wash. The subject was the Internet and how it might
revolutionize the computer software business. Few concrete plans
were made that day, but Microsoft executives insist that a
direction was set. ``Our vision from the outset was to unite the
two worlds of the Windows desktop and the Internet,'' said Steven
Sinofsky, a Microsoft executive who attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Microsoft badly trailed Netscape in the browser field. To
hasten its entry, Microsoft licensed its early browsing software
from Spyglass Inc. of Naperville, Ill. The first meeting between
the two companies was initiated by Spyglass in April 1994. At the
time, it was a tiny company and eager to do a deal with Microsoft.
Spyglass was selected as the commercial licensee for browser
technology developed by the National Center for Supercomputing at
the University of Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1994, Douglas Colbeth, president of Spyglass,
met with Clark of Netscape at O'Hare International Airport in
Chicago. The two men talked in the United Airlines Red Carpet Room,
reserved for business-class passengers, and Colbeth recalled Clark
telling him, ``We're going to take Microsoft head-on.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Colbeth recalled thinking to himself, ``Great, now
Microsoft will really want to license from me.'' Today, he noted:
``Remember, we were a company with a couple dozen people and almost
no money in the bank. Netscape had Jim Clark, with his money and
reputation, and big-time venture capital backing from Silicon
Valley. Netscape had a very different agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   By July 1994, Microsoft had become quite interested in the
Spyglass technology, Colbeth says, and the two companies signed
their first licensing agreement the following December. Microsoft,
Colbeth recalls, always told him that it would eventually fold
browser technology into its operating system, but its timing was
accelerated by Netscape's rapid rise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft was initially hoping to charge for the browser,''
Colbeth said.
</P>
<P>
   But on Dec. 7, 1995, Gates declared that Microsoft would not
only deeply integrate its browser into Windows but would give it
away. The announcement caught the industry, even Colbeth, by
surprise. At the time, Spyglass had licensed its technology to 82
other companies, including IBM and Digital Equipment, for use in
their software products _ a licensing revenue stream of about $20
million a year.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of Microsoft's move, Spyglass saw those revenues
vanish within a year, as smaller Internet software companies went
out of business and big customers shifted to Microsoft's free
browser. Spyglass slashed its payroll and scrambled into new niches
of the software industry to replace its lost sales, which it
succeeded in doing eventually.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever you license technology to Microsoft, you have to
understand it can someday build it itself, drop it into the
operating system and put you out of that business,'' Colbeth said.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY _ Uneasy shifts in presidential selection process
 &HT;    Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   We turn for a moment from the great drama in Washington (they
won't miss us) to ponder a development which could easily have a
more defining political impact. The ground has literally moved
under the presidential selection process.
</P>
<P>
   There's been a good deal of speculation since Gov. Pete Wilson
signed legislation last week that moves California's presidential
primary from early June to March 7: which candidates will be helped
or hurt, what's the impact on Iowa and New Hampshire, and so forth.
</P>
<P>
   But for Georgia, which also votes on March 7, the impact is
relatively clear. The state's early March primary date, which
allowed it to wield a fair amount of influence in the 1992
primaries, has become the political equivalent of Abernathy Road at
rush hour.
</P>
<P>
   New York, Maryland, Colorado and five New England states already
have their primaries set for March 7. Washington and Oregon appear
likely to approve a West Coast sweep, moving their dates in line
with California. The governors of New Jersey and Pennsylvania, both
of whom are Y2K GOP possibilities, have indicated they're looking
at the date, also.
</P>
<P>
   It makes little sense to bemoan the loss of the fleeting clout
Georgia enjoyed when it was the largest state voting this early.
California's decision to move up in the line, debated in that
state's Legislature for several years before it was enacted,
changes the equilibrium so dramatically that the old rules for
gaining advantage in each party's selection no longer mean much,
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Like the forced evolution of the college bowl system into a
national football playoff, the drift toward a national primary is a
work in progress. California has simply moved the timetable
forward.
</P>
<P>
   The March 7, 2000, primaries won't be the final stage, but they
will change the strategic priorities of the campaigns in such a way
that a national primary would be a logical next step.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Lewis Massey said he plans to attend a
special meeting of the National Association of Secretaries of State
to hear from other Southern and Eastern states about how they view
the impact of the California move. If there is to be any turning
back from the drift toward One Big Primary, it will probably have
to begin in discussions like these over the next several months.
</P>
<P>
   An interesting wrinkle is California's new open primary law,
which allows voters to choose candidates of either party - in their
primaries earlier this year, for instance, a voter could have
selected Democrat Gray Davis in the governor's race and Republican
Matt Fong for U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Because this runs afoul of Republican and Democratic Party
rules, California voters are being asked to approve a proposition
that would exempt the presidential primary from the open rules.
</P>
<P>
   But the whiff of a new idea could have some impact in an
atmosphere in which the old rules for choosing each party's
candidates no longer apply. The two parties are losing their
influence over this process faster than any state. If the idea of a
national, non-partisan primary to select both party's nominees
seems a little la-la right now, give California a little time to
work its influence.

<P>
   THE NONOPTION COMPAQ: SUDDENLY SEES THE LIGHT  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Well into 1996, Netscape's share of the browser market continued
to rise, while Microsoft made little headway, even though its
browser was free. Industry analysts and trade magazines agreed that
Netscape's browser was the clear technical leader. In April 1996,
Netscape's Navigator was used by 87 percent of people browsing the
Web, compared with 4 percent using Microsoft's Internet Explorer,
according to Zona Research.
</P>
<P>
   So the biggest personal computer maker, Compaq, thought it made
sense to give customers Netscape's browser instead of Microsoft's.
But Microsoft would not stand for that _ and Compaq had no choice
but to give in.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1996, Compaq wanted not only to load the more popular
Netscape browser on its machines but also to remove the icon for
Microsoft's Internet Explorer, which was delivered to the computer
maker with Windows 95. Microsoft informed Compaq that if it removed
Internet Explorer, the computer maker would lose its license for
Windows, said Stephen Decker, Compaq's director of software
procurement, in testimony to federal investigators.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimatum from Microsoft was delivered bluntly in a letter
headed, ``Notice of Intent to Terminate License Agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Faced with being denied the essential operating system, Compaq
quickly reversed course and kept the Internet Explorer icon.
Microsoft asserts that Windows and Internet Explorer are a single
product and that Microsoft alone defines what is in the product.
Nothing in its contracts, Microsoft adds, prohibits computer makers
from including competing technologies.
</P>
<P>
   While the cutoff letter Microsoft sent to Compaq seems an
unnecessarily hardball tactic when dealing with its largest
corporate customer, Microsoft chief operating officer Bob Herbold
insists that ``to take one letter here or one snippet of e-mail
there to try to portray Microsoft as an arrogant company is
unfair.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting that a Compaq executive is a witness for Microsoft,
Herbold said, ``We are totally dependent on tremendous
relationships with key companies like Compaq.''
</P>
<P>
   At Netscape, however, the Compaq episode was a watershed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the singular act that got me going to the Justice
Department,'' Barksdale recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Barksdale said he regarded Microsoft's tactic of forcing Compaq
to buy its browser as a condition of obtaining an essential
product, the Windows operating system, as ``an illegal act and
absolute proof that Microsoft was a monopolist.'' After
investigating the incident, the Justice Department and the states
agreed with Barksdale that Microsoft was illegally tying the sale
of one product to another.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft replies that it has a long history of adding new
features to its operating system. And from the outset, Microsoft
says, it intended that Windows and its Internet Explorer browser
would be seamlessly integrated, as they are now in Windows 98.
Thus, Microsoft insists, there is no product-tying violation of
antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate case, a federal appeals court sided with
Microsoft, upholding the principle that the company could put
whatever it wanted to in its operating system and declare it a
single product.
</P>
<P>
   But in June 1996, when Compaq wanted to offer the Netscape
product instead of Microsoft's browser, most industry experts
viewed the browser and operating system as two different software
programs. ``It took a long time for the integration strategy to
play out,'' said a former senior Microsoft researcher. ``Back then,
integration was basically bolting a browser onto Windows.''
</P>
<P>
   THE `BALANCING ACT': AMERICA ONLINE TOSSES IN TOWEL
</P>
<P>
   America Online chairman Stephen Case refers to dealing with
Microsoft as ``a delicate balancing act.'' That balance swung
sharply from the fall of 1995 to the spring of 1996, when Microsoft
used the lure of giving America Online a featured place on the
Windows desktop as the ultimate bargaining chip. To gain access to
computing's most coveted real estate, America Online agreed to make
Microsoft's Internet Explorer the main browser for its online
subscribers, who now number more than 13 million.
</P>
<P>
   Yet throughout 1995, as Microsoft prepared to introduce Windows
95, the most significant improvement ever in its operating system,
Case was knocking on the door of the Justice Department. His
complaint was that Microsoft was going to place its new online
service, Microsoft Network, a direct competitor to America Online,
prominently on the desktop screen of Windows 95, which was
introduced in August. This bundling tactic of using the
industry-dominant operating system to market Microsoft Network, or
MSN, Case argued, gave Microsoft an unfair advantage in the young
but fast-growing online business.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department listened and investigated. But
ultimately, the government decided against taking any action.
</P>
<P>
   At America Online's headquarters in Vienna, Va., Microsoft was
both feared and loathed at the time. America Online had a
designated ``Microsoft watcher,'' a young M.B.A. who tracked its
adversary's every move. Above the desk in his small, windowless
office was a picture of Gates. Beneath the picture, in large block
letters, were the words ``THE ENEMY.''
</P>
<P>
   Though America Online was the clear leader in the online
services business, it had ample reason to worry about an all-out
assault by a rival as rich and aggressive as Microsoft. When he had
visited the Microsoft headquarters a couple of years earlier, Case
recalled, Gates had bluntly assessed Microsoft's options by saying
he could buy 20 percent of America Online, all of it or enter the
online business on his own and ``bury you.''
</P>
<P>
   A threat or merely a statement of the facts? ``A bit of both,''
Case said recently. ``But he was mainly articulating what everybody
at that meeting kind of intuitively understood.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet by 1996, Microsoft and America Online found they had reason
to cooperate. With the exploding popularity of the Internet's World
Wide Web, the conventional online companies, like America Online
and Compuserve, had to provide their customers Internet access as
well as their own services. America Online had its own browser, but
to keep pace with the rapidly advancing technology it made sense to
do a deal with Netscape or Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   For both software companies, a deal with America Online, which
had 5 million subscribers at the time, could mean a big surge in
browser use and market share.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape seemed the natural partner for America Online, since
both companies were Microsoft rivals. On March 11, America Online
did announce that it would buy Netscape technology, but it was a
standard licensing deal based on a payment-for-use formula. The
next day, America Online announced a more significant deal with
Microsoft making its browser the default technology _ the browser
America Online subscribers would use unless they specifically asked
for Netscape's Navigator.
</P>
<P>
   To win the deal, Microsoft offered to give America Online a
start-up icon on the Windows desktop _ precisely the kind of equal
treatment on the main Windows screen that Case had asked the
Justice Department to require of Microsoft. ``After we agreed to
its Internet Explorer browser, Microsoft allowed us to be bundled
on the Windows desktop,'' Case said. ``It was an example of
Microsoft's pragmatic side.''
</P>
<P>
   The pragmatic decision was that the paramount corporate goal was
to increase browser market share to protect the mainstay software
business. As a result, its new online service, MSN, would have to
sacrifice an important marketing advantage over its main rival,
America Online.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was Bill's decision,'' said former MSN general manager
Russell Siegelman, referring to Gates. ``He sent me e-mail on it.
He said he didn't think it would hurt MSN that much. I disagreed
with him.''
</P>
<P>
   To other Microsoft executives, Gates expressed a different view
of the likely impact on MSN. He told senior vice president Brad
Silverberg that putting America Online on the Windows desktop would
amount to ``putting a bullet through MSN's head,'' according to a
deposition taken by the Justice Department.

 UNDATED: Justice Department.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the antitrust suit, the government asserts that the America
Online deal shows how Microsoft used the power of its Windows
monopoly to give it an edge in the browser war against Netscape.
David Colburn, a senior vice president of America Online who took
part in the browser negotiations with Microsoft, is a witness for
the government.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Microsoft has overhauled its Internet strategy to focus
mainly on building popular special-interest Web sites in fields
like travel, personal finance, automobile retailing and news. And
it is putting these sites, along with e-mail and search features,
in an all-in-one site that uses the name MSN.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still regard Microsoft as a primary threat,'' Case observed.
``Microsoft has a history of getting it right in the long run, and
there's no reason to think it won't in this business as well. We
will always be in Microsoft's cross hairs.''
</P>
<P>
   THE LESSON: DON'T CONFRONT A STEAMROLLER
</P>
<P>
   At Netscape's headquarters in Silicon Valley, the strategy today
is one of avoiding head-to-head competition with Microsoft whenever
possible. ``Don't do something that is in Microsoft's path _ that's
the lesson learned,'' observed Clark, the Netscape chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Silicon Valley's venture capitalists, the investors who finance
so many of the nation's high-tech startups, generally follow the
Netscape formula these days. Yet that still leaves ample room to
prosper. For while competing directly with Microsoft is dangerous,
the software industry as a whole is an engine of wealth creation,
job generation and technical innovation.
</P>
<P>
   And there is an ambivalent side to the venture community's
relationship with Microsoft. For if a start-up cannot steer clear
of Microsoft entirely, the favored option is to be bought out by
Microsoft, which has scooped up many fledgling companies as a way
of acquiring promising technology and people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft understands start-up innovation and how to co-opt
start-up innovation better than any other high-tech company,'' said
James Breyer, managing partner of Accel Partners, a venture capital
firm.
</P>
<P>
   As Microsoft has grown, it has come to be seen not merely as a
competitor but as a force of nature that shapes the business
environment, like a weather front.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft is incredibly pervasive,'' said Stewart Alsop, a
partner with New Enterprise Associates, a venture capital firm in
Menlo Park, Calif. At the board meetings of the companies in which
his firm has invested, two issues always come up, he said: ``One is
the price of the company's stock, and the other is what Microsoft
is going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years, Microsoft has offered its guidance during
almost yearly meetings between senior Microsoft executives and
leading venture capitalists. The meetings are part of Microsoft's
effort to improve its sometimes prickly relations with Silicon
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``We work hard to provide clarity about where we're going and
where we're not going,'' said Greg Maffei, Microsoft's chief
financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's conference took place in October at the Quadrus
office building on Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park, the Wall Street of
high-tech venture investing. Maffei led a team of five Microsoft
executives who appeared before a group of 40 venture capitalists,
one of whom stood and asked the question that seemed to be on the
minds of many of his peers: ``How do I invest in a company that
stays out of the way of the steamroller?''
</P>
<P>
   Maffei, recalled one person who attended the meeting, stood up
and delivered a brief lecture on businesses that Microsoft was
likely to avoid. His list included specialized software for
manufacturing, human resources management, computer-aided design
and others. But, this person noted, broad swaths of the industry
appeared to be designated as off limits _ including new software
platforms that might compete with Microsoft's personal computer
operating system.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Ruthann Quindlen, a partner with Institutional
Venture Partners, leaned over to Vinod Khosla, a co-founder of Sun
Microsystems and a partner at the venture capital firm Kleiner
Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers, and said quietly, ``I guess that leaves
us washing machines and toasters.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY _ Uneasy shifts in presidential selection process
 &HT;    Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   We turn for a moment from the great drama in Washington (they
won't miss us) to ponder a development which could easily have a
more defining political impact. The ground has literally moved
under the presidential selection process.
</P>
<P>
   There's been a good deal of speculation since Gov. Pete Wilson
signed legislation last week that moves California's presidential
primary from early June to March 7: which candidates will be helped
or hurt, what's the impact on Iowa and New Hampshire, and so forth.
</P>
<P>
   But for Georgia, which also votes on March 7, the impact is
relatively clear. The state's early March primary date, which
allowed it to wield a fair amount of influence in the 1992
primaries, has become the political equivalent of Abernathy Road at
rush hour.
</P>
<P>
   New York, Maryland, Colorado and five New England states already
have their primaries set for March 7. Washington and Oregon appear
likely to approve a West Coast sweep, moving their dates in line
with California. The governors of New Jersey and Pennsylvania, both
of whom are Y2K GOP possibilities, have indicated they're looking
at the date, also.
</P>
<P>
   It makes little sense to bemoan the loss of the fleeting clout
Georgia enjoyed when it was the largest state voting this early.
California's decision to move up in the line, debated in that
state's Legislature for several years before it was enacted,
changes the equilibrium so dramatically that the old rules for
gaining advantage in each party's selection no longer mean much,
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Like the forced evolution of the college bowl system into a
national football playoff, the drift toward a national primary is a
work in progress. California has simply moved the timetable
forward.
</P>
<P>
   The March 7, 2000, primaries won't be the final stage, but they
will change the strategic priorities of the campaigns in such a way
that a national primary would be a logical next step.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Lewis Massey said he plans to attend a
special meeting of the National Association of Secretaries of State
to hear from other Southern and Eastern states about how they view
the impact of the California move. If there is to be any turning
back from the drift toward One Big Primary, it will probably have
to begin in discussions like these over the next several months.
</P>
<P>
   An interesting wrinkle is California's new open primary law,
which allows voters to choose candidates of either party - in their
primaries earlier this year, for instance, a voter could have
selected Democrat Gray Davis in the governor's race and Republican
Matt Fong for U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Because this runs afoul of Republican and Democratic Party
rules, California voters are being asked to approve a proposition
that would exempt the presidential primary from the open rules.
</P>
<P>
   But the whiff of a new idea could have some impact in an
atmosphere in which the old rules for choosing each party's
candidates no longer apply. The two parties are losing their
influence over this process faster than any state. If the idea of a
national, non-partisan primary to select both party's nominees
seems a little la-la right now, give California a little time to
work its influence.

PROFESSORS SUE TO PROTECT WORK FROM MICROSOFT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOANN MULLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a First Amendment case that could have profound effects on
the academic and business worlds, two Boston-area professors will
go to federal court Thursday to try to prevent Microsoft Corp. from
gaining access to their private research.
</P>
<P>
   David Yoffie from Harvard Business School, and Michael Cusumano
from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology _ are co-authors of
an upcoming book about the travails of Netscape Communications
Corp., Microsoft's chief rival in the market for Web browsing
software. The book, called ``Competing on Internet Time: Lessons
from Netscape and its Battle with Microsoft,'' is due to be
published Oct. 20.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft wants to get its hands on the professors' background
material, including some 200 hours of taped interviews with current
and former Netscape executives, to bolster its defense in a broad
antitrust suit brought by the US Department of Justice.
</P>
<P>
   The government has accused Microsoft of using its near-monopoly
in computer operating systems to gain an unfair advantange in the
market for Web browsers, where Netscape once was dominant. The
trial begins Oct. 15 in US District Court in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But Microsoft was heartened by passages in an early
Yoffie-Cusumano manuscript in which Netscape officials admit they
made mistakes in their war with the Redmond, Wash.,-based software
giant. Now Microsoft wants to see more.
</P>
<P>
   The company's attorneys have subpoenaed all of the authors'
research for the book, including 2,000 pages of interview
transcripts and notes.
</P>
<P>
   But Yoffie and Cusumano have refused to cooperate, calling
Microsoft's subpoena ``a fishing expedition.'' They have filed a
motion to quash Microsoft's subpoena, and it will be up to US
District Court Judge Richard Stearns to decide whether they should
be compelled to turn over the material.
</P>
<P>
   Employing the same defense that allows journalists to protect
their sources, the authors contend Microsoft's demand violates
their right to free speech and would compromise their ability to
conduct scholarly research in the future.
</P>
<P>
   As part of their research for books as well as for academic case
studies, professors routinely are given in-depth access to
corporate executives and files _ as long as they agree to allow the
company being profiled to review the manuscript before it is
published. Such non-disclosure agreements are intended to ensure
that proprietary information is not shared with the public.
</P>
<P>
   This type of research, which is the bread-and-butter activity of
many business school professors, depends on building trust with the
companies they are profiling, Yoffie said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real fear I have, and Harvard Business School in general
has, is that if companies are fearful that this information will be
exposed in court, they will simply not want to engage in case
research or book research in the future, which would have a very
chilling effect on management education.'' Case studies, he noted,
are the heart of Harvard Business School's curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   But Microsoft says statements in the book attributed to Netscape
executives are central to the issues in the antitrust case and
Microsoft should be entitled, as a defendant, to present that
evidence in court.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is very important evidence of Netscape executives in
their own words saying it was their own business mistakes and
failure to execute that have caused their problems, not
Microsoft,'' said Microsoft spokesman Greg Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   The published book itself is not sufficient evidence, Microsoft
believes, because Netscape executives could claim they were
misquoted. The reason Microsoft wants the tapes and the other
background material is to ensure that the quotes are accurate,
complete and not taken out of context.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to actually be able to hear Netscape executives
in their own words supporting Microsoft's position,'' Shaw said.
</P>
<P>
   The case before Judge Stearns, therefore, pits Microsoft's right
to obtain evidence through the discovery process against the
authors' First Amendment rights.
</P>
<P>
   It's a difficult balancing act, said Joseph D. Steinfield, an
attorney at Hill &AMP; Barlow in Boston who specializes in First
Amendment issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft apparently wants to obtain information that they
think will be helpful to their case. You can't blame a litigant for
trying to do that. And the law in general encourages everybody to
give whatever evidence they may have that is relevant,'' Steinfield
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem,'' he said, ``is that there's a strong competing
value, which is the First Amendment value.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinfield believes Microsoft will have a difficult burden in
court.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say `We want to know everything you know' ordinarily would
not be permitted, other than in an extreme and urgent situation, or
if the party can satisfy the court that the information is crucial
and not otherwise easily obtainable.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the authors were able to go out and get the information,
then one would think Microsoft could go out and get the
information,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute has an odd familiarity to MIT's Cusumano, whose 1995
book, ``Microsoft Secrets,'' had a central role in a previous
government antitrust case against Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; That book, while mostly positive, disclosed some Microsoft
business practices that could be viewed by some as anticompetitive,
Cusumano said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Department of Justice tried to subpoena
his &UR;  &LR; taped interviews with Microsoft officials for the same purpose
that Microsoft now seeks the Netscape tapes.
</P>
<P>
   But Cusumano refused to cooperate, and the government dropped
its demand.
</P>
<P>
   Not so Microsoft.

UNCERTAINTY DOGS BRAZILIAN ECONOMY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO _ Latin America's largest country marked two
milestones this week: It re-elected a president for the first time
in its history, and its constitution turned 10 years old.
</P>
<P>
   But there is little joy in the streets of Brazil. Instead, there
is deep concern and uncertainty about what will happen next to its
sputtering $800 billion economy.
</P>
<P>
   As more ballots were counted Wednesday from Sunday's national
elections, it was clear that President Fernando Henrique Cardoso
has been given another four years in office. What remains unclear
is when Cardoso will move to repair the economy and how he will
address the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The 67-year-old sociologist has avoided a runoff election
against his left-wing challenger, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. But
the victory was not a resounding one. With 91 percent of the votes
counted, Cardoso received about 53 percent. But da Silva did better
than most exit polls predicted by winning about 32 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, members of da Silva's five-party coalition said
Monday that they won't go along with the president's plan to reduce
Brazil's $60 billion deficit _ about 7 percent of the country's
gross domestic product _ for fear that it would hurt the poor and
lead to higher unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   And worse still for Cardoso was news that many of his own allies
for gubernatorial and congressional seats _ support he'll need to
get controversial fiscal and constitutional reforms passed _ are
stuck in close races that won't be decided until final elections
are held in three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Now, observers say, Cardoso faces a key decision: whether to
please investors by seizing on this week's victory and agreeing
quickly to a loan package with the International Monetary Fund, or
to satisfy his political partners by postponing a plan until after
the final elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``His credibility would suffer seriously if he tried to wait
three weeks before stating his plans,'' said Scott Mainwaring, a
Brazil expert and director of the Kellogg Institute of
International Studies at the University of Notre Dame. ``I think he
has to start talking about the reforms now because he cannot afford
to deceive the public.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Brazilians, global investors and international
monetary lenders are also waiting to see what Cardoso will do next.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's won his election, so now it's time to get the economy
ticking again,'' said one New York City investment analyst. ``I
don't think the markets are willing to wait much longer for a
plan.''
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks leading up to the election, Cardoso, a social
democrat, both promised and warned that severe measures would be
taken to fix Brazil's economy, but he hasn't offered specific
proposals yet. Those announcements helped slow the amount of
foreign capital fleeing Brazil's markets, but haven't stopped it.
About $30 billion has left Brazil since early August.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the day after the elections, the Brazilian stock
market, which has lost about 40 percent of its value since the
beginning of the year, fell again. The market fell 179.76 points
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Top Cardoso administration officials, including finance minister
Pedro Malan, have been negotiating with IMF officials over a loan
package of about $30 billion, but nothing formal has been
announced. In return, IMF officials have said they want assurances
that the government deficit will be cut.
</P>
<P>
   Another possibility is that the country's currrency, the real,
could be devaulued soon, a move that might jeopardize a successful
currency- and inflation-stabilizing plan that Cardoso implemented
back in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Cardoso's critics blame him for making Brazil too dependent on
money from investors and too vulnerable to volatile swings in
capital markets. Last week, in a sign the administration may soon
adopt tighter rules, the director of monetary policy for the
central bank told the Financial Times of London that it may limit
the amount of short-term money that comes into the country during
periods of market turbulence.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Cardoso's allies worry that an agreement with the IMF,
an unpopular organization remembered for the strict measures it
imposed here during the battle against hyper-inflation in the
1980s, might prompt a backlash that would jeopardize their
campaigns. But now, even ordinary citizens are ready to hear what
Cardoso's plans are.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there will be pain, but it would be better to know now
so that we can prepare for it,'' said Mateos Goncalves, a
44-year-old banker in Rio de Janeiro who voted for the incumbent.
``Sometimes it's more painful to sit and wait.''

NIKKEI SOARS AFTER JAPAN EDGES CLOSER TO A BANK BAILOUT
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By SHERYL WuDUNN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The governing party edged closer Wednesday to injecting
massive amounts of money into the Japanese banking system, and that
prospect sent investors rushing into markets with greatly improved
hopes of an economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberal Democratic Party introduced legislation to enhance
the capital base of banks that are sound, but weakly capitalized.
The legislation, which would add to a bank-rescue package approved
last week, provides 10 trillion yen, or nearly $80 billion, in
taxpayers' money to recapitalize the Japanese banks, with an option
to provide more.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realized we should hurry, though it doesn't mean that we
can pass any bill no matter what its content,'' said Chikara
Sakaguchi, deputy head of the New Peace Party, a newly pivotal
player in the opposition group. That party and another small one
now seem close to pooling their votes with those of the Liberal
Democrats to support the measure, ensuring passage.
</P>
<P>
   Encouraged by the prospects of the Liberal Democrats' greater
influence, the benchmark Nikkei average of 225 shares soared 803.97
points, or 6.2 percent, to 13,825.61, with the index logging its
second-largest single-day gain of the year in a rally that helped
push markets higher throughout Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, the stock market tumbled to its lowest level in
nearly 13 years. Over the weekend, Japan's financial leaders
painted a picture of gloom for American and foreign officials in
Washington. In one of his most outspoken remarks, Masaru Hayami,
the governor of the Bank of Japan, told Treasury Secretary Robert
Rubin that Japan's top banks are short of capital and that
taxpayers' money would be necessary to strengthen them.
</P>
<P>
   Hayami was criticized by Japanese bankers, including Satoru
Kiishi, head of the nation's banking association, who said that he
was ``deeply worried'' that the remarks could ``further erode
confidence'' in Japan's banking system. But many analysts say that
boosting the capital of the banking system is crucial to financial
stability and ultimately, economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``First and foremost, the policy priority is to recapitalize the
banking system,'' James Fiorillo, a banking analyst at ING Barings
in Tokyo, said. ``They can worry about the pure market principle
later.''
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts, politicians and bankers say that Hayami's
remarks, along with those by Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa,
appear to have been cleverly staged to inspire worry among the
opposition parties and force them to buckle to the demands of the
Liberal Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts also say that even if Hayami's remarks were scripted,
they may reflect a new sense of urgency among government and
central bank officials. Though the government has warned about the
severity of Japan's recession _ it now forecasts the economy will
shrink by 1.8 percent in the fiscal year ending March 1999 _
politicians bickered for months over what to do about it.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But last week, when the Nikkei average plunged below 13,000,
banking officials appear to have gotten nervous because of the
impact that lower stock prices have on the capital bases of
Japanese banks. As of the end of March, the most recent statistics
offered by the Bank of Japan, all Japanese banks technically met
the capital adequacy requirements set forth by the Bank for
International Settlements.
</P>
<P>
   Under Bank for International Settlements guidelines, the falling
stock prices did not have an impact on the Japanese banks, which
are still suitably capitalized. But that is reassuring only for
those who focus on accounting rules that permit the banks to value
stock portfolios at cost, and in reality the declining stock market
clearly meant that banks had less padding. That seems to be the
concern that Hayami tried to raise in Washington, and it is also of
concern to investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The markets were worried about bank failures, about a massive
banking crisis that would envelop all the banks and sink the
market,'' said Craig O. Chudler, a strategist at Salomon Smith
Barney in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the rebound was encouraging, but that government
officials might not do enough to make it last. ``They may be
preventing a meltdown, but they're not promoting growth,'' he said.

FOR SOME PROTESTERS, A QUIET SHOW OF DISSATISFACTION IS ENOUGH 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ With his long hair and dark blue beret, Vladimir
Tyuterev, 31, didn't look like most of the other demonstrators at
Wednesday's mass protest in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   He was not waving a red flag like the Communists. He was not
dressed in black like the members of nationalist youth groups. He
did not carry a placard calling for President Boris Yeltsin's
resignation.
</P>
<P>
   And although he is a union representative at his
government-financed forensic laboratory, he was not obligated to
join the stream of marchers heading across the Moscow River to the
slope beneath St. Basil's Cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   But on a bright cold autumn afternoon, he was there nonetheless,
if for no other reason than to register his own private
dissatisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``There comes a time when you have to show that you don't accept
what is going on,'' he said. ``The situation now is such that that
time has come.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time Tyuterev took to the streets was in August 1991,
when as a student he rallied to the defense of Yeltsin's besieged
headquarters during the coup that set off the collapse of Communism
in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Tyuterev is not one who begrudges the changes of the last years.
He and his wife, now on maternity leave with their 3-month-old
baby, saved up enough one year to spend a month in India, the kind
of private excursion that would have been impossible in Communist
times.
</P>
<P>
   And so he has no sympathy for the Communists, who together with
the labor unions organized Wednesday's demonstrations. ``I do not
want a Communist comeback,'' he said. ``We didn't come here with
red flags or anything like that.''
</P>
<P>
   He is even ambivalent about calls for Yeltsin's resignation.
``Times change,'' he said. ``People change. In 1991 it was a time
of euphoria. Our president has changed too.''
</P>
<P>
   What he does want is a government that will take charge and get
the Russian economy working again. ``For the past five years no one
put any money in the real economy,'' he said, after complaining
about his laboratory's woefully outdated and worn-out equipment.
</P>
<P>
   But mainly, like many other Russians with a university degree
and miserably paid jobs, Tyuterev is tired of being ignored.
</P>
<P>
   His colleague Mark Sonis, a union official and senior expert at
the Federal Forensic Center, was marching beneath a modest
black-and-white cardboard sign that simply announced their
presence. ``People are fed up with all this business,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Like other government workers, the forensic experts live on a
fixed income _ although there is nothing fixed about a monthly
salary of 1,200 rubles that did not materialize at all in
September, which typically gets paid in dribs and drabs and which
in dollar terms dropped from $200 to $80 after the ruble began its
nosedive in August.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he could support his family on such a sum at a time of
surging inflation, Tyuterev shrugged and talked about the savings
he figured would tide them through another month or two.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Tyuterev's family lives with his wife's parents, and even before
the current crisis, neither he nor his wife could think of buying a
car, let alone their own apartment, so the postponement of such
dreams for them is no tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Russia, people who work for the government are not
middle-class, not by a long shot,'' said another colleague, Andrei
Bobrov, 32, a ballistics expert and bachelor who lives with his
mother, sister, brother-in-law and young nephew.
</P>
<P>
   There were times in the last few years that Bobrov was tempted
to join friends in Moscow's booming private sector, but now, as
those friends find themselves suddenly unemployed, he is just as
glad he did not.
</P>
<P>
   ``One just called me this week to say he was going out to the
countryside to dig for potatoes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bobrov has no time left for Yeltsin _ ``he is a clown'' _ and in
the 1996 elections he voted first for Grigory Yavlinsky, leader of
a liberal opposition party, and then in the second round
``against'' the Communist leader Gennadi Zyuganov, Yeltsin's chief
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   But he still puzzles over the passivity of most Russians, who
continue to put up with a miserly existence.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people at the lab today were saying, `Why go?' ''
said Bobrov. ``They all have their troubles, and they might come
out and protest for themselves. But they won't do it for the sake
of groups that they think will use them for their own temporary
political motives.''

U.N. AND IRAQ CONTINUE QUEST FOR AGREEMENT ON WEAPONS SEARCHES 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ After 10 days of talks, Iraq and the United
Nations said Wednesday that they had failed to break a two-month
impasse that prevented spot searches for weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
   But both sides said they intended to pursue a search for a
peaceful way out that might allow Iraq to have some idea when
economic sanctions might be eased and satisfy the Security Council
that Baghdad has disbanded its nuclear, biological and chemical
weapons systems as well as missiles to deliver them.
</P>
<P>
   Senior diplomats here emphasized that Iraq and the United
States, as well as other key members of the Security Council, were
eager to avoid another confrontation like the one that nearly led
the United States to bomb Iraq in February.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody wants a fight,'' said a senior Arab diplomat who is
familiar with the views of Iraq and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Iraqis want a way to climb down from their ban on
inspections in return for a little gain, as they have done in every
confrontation over the past few months,'' the diplomat said. ``And
the Americans are in no position to wage an attack on Iraq right
now, given the domestic situation in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz of Iraq said, ``We are going to
weigh the situation in its entirety in Baghdad.'' He led an
unusually large delegation to New York that included the foreign
minister, several senior diplomats and top scientists in the
attempt to lobby for a new approach to the weapons inspection
system and ease economic sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded
Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   A statement issued by Secretary-General Kofi Annan's office
simply said ``both sides agreed that the process of dialogue would
continue.''
</P>
<P>
   Both sides now seem to put their hopes on a so-called
``comprehensive review,'' a compromise proposed by Annan. It would
examine Iraq's compliance so far with all aspects of the
elimination of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons of mass
destruction and propose a timetable for easing the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   A senior U.N. official who insisted on anonymity said the
``beauty of a `comprehensive review' is that everybody can put
everything they want in it. It's workable.''
</P>
<P>
   A benefit of the review, from Iraq's standpoint, is that if it
can prove that it has complied sufficiently, it can expect a
schedule for lifting some of the economic sanctions. Those
sanctions are crippling the country's economy and impoverishing its
20 million people.
</P>
<P>
   In return, the Security Council would obtain the immediate
return of the U.N. Special Commission inspectors who were banned by
Iraq from spot checks since Aug. 5, when Iraq mounted its latest
challenge to the inspections. But the U.N. official also said
Iraq's adversaries can ``throw into the pot'' other kinds of issues
like Iraq's compliance with demands for compensation for the Iraqi
occupation of Kuwait and the fate of missing Kuwaiti prisoners of
war.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has said that it would agree to a
comprehensive review only six to eight weeks after Baghdad allows
the resumption of weapon inspections. Aziz said it was
``premature'' to talk of resumption of inspections.
</P>
<P>
   In the attempt to gain more time, the United Nations is sending
Annan's special envoy, Prakash Shah of India, a country on friendly
terms with Iraq, to smooth the way toward an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   In his talk with reporters Wednesday after meeting Annan, Aziz
denied a report in The New York Times on Wednesday that French
tests appear to have found traces of chemicals linked to the nerve
gas VX on Iraqi warheads, but are refraining from making the
announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Aziz said the report was politically motivated and ``timed to
sow confusion and suspicion'' as Iraq pursued its quest to lift
sanctions.

IN THE OLD DAYS, POLS SETTLED DIFFERENCES WITH A GOOD BOURBON 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Oct. 11)   (For Use By New York Times News Service Clients)  
 By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ ``Hugo,'' said Harry Truman, ``I don't much care
for your law, but, by golly, this bourbon is good.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus did the 33rd president express his appreciation of the
mellow whiskey served by Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black, who had
just written the court's majority opinion decreeing that Truman's
seizure of the nation's strike-bound steel mills was
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Truman, in one of the most controversial decisions of his very
controversial presidency, had sought to have the government run the
mills rather than see them shut down because of a nationwide strike
while Americans were fighting and dying in the Korean War. The year
was 1952 and his action precipitated a constitutional crisis.
</P>
<P>
   To his staff, the plain-spoken Missourian said: ``The president
has the power to keep the country from going to hell.''
</P>
<P>
   But Black, writing for the court's majority, declared: ``We
cannot with faithfulness to our constitutional system hold that the
commander-in-chief of the armed forces has the ultimate power as
such to take possession of private property in order to keep labor
disputes from stopping production. This is a job for the nation's
lawmakers, not for its military authorities.''
</P>
<P>
   Truman was especially irate because five of the six justices who
joined in the majority opinion were Democrats appointed by himself
or his predecessor, Franklin D. Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   Black understood this and, in order to establish better
relations between the president and the court, he invited Truman
and the other justices to his elegant Virginia home across the
Potomac River from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   It was then that the president savored Black's bourbon and began
to mellow toward the justices.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the constitution was upheld, but at an enormous
price. The shutdown, which lasted for seven weeks after the Supreme
Court ruling, was the costliest steel strike in the history of the
republic.
</P>
<P>
   According to Truman biographer David McCullough, ``Losses in
production, losses in wages were unprecedented _ 21 million tons of
steel and $400 million in wages, as 600,000 steel workers and 1.4
million others in related industries were idle. The military output
scheduled for 1952 was cut by a third.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary Robert Lovett lamented: ``No enemy could have
so crippled our production as has this work stoppage. The weird and
tragic thing is that we have done this to ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   As we move ever more deeply into a new constitutional crisis,
this one precipitated by Bill Clinton's personal conduct and the
demand of the Republican hierarchy on Capitol Hill for his
impeachment, it is worth noting how people of good intentions can
differ sharply over the meaning of the timeless document written
211 years ago in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   In the steel case, the president and the court majority were at
odds over the constitutional powers of the president. Partisan
politics did not play a role in the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   But in the impeachment drama centering around Clinton's
misbehavior, politics is a major player, despite the claims of
leaders in both parties that they are not indulging in
partisanship.
</P>
<P>
   Many, but not all, Democrats would rather censure the president
than impeach him. Most Republicans claim impeachment is the only
remedy for presidential misconduct provided by the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats would limit the subject matter of the House Judiciary
Committee inquiry to the Monica Lewinsky affair and set a time
limit on the probe. The Republicans have decreed that they will not
be limited in either the focus or the time of their investigation.
They will adhere to the plan adopted by the Democratic majority in
the Watergate probe of Richard Nixon 24 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But because the Constitution is ambiguous in defining ``high
crimes and misdemeanors,'' the issue has been debated throughout
the history of the republic. We possess no definitive explanation
of what activities fall under that umbrella.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott startled some of his
Republican colleagues and angered a number of Democrats when he
declared last month that a president could be impeached for ``bad
conduct'' that brings ``disrepute'' to his office.
</P>
<P>
   But Iowa Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin responded by recalling that
during the impeachment inquiry into the activities of Richard Nixon
in 1974, Lott, then a member of the House Judiciary Committee,
signed a minority report stating that ``general misbehavior'' was
not grounds for impeachment of a president.
</P>
<P>
   Almost anyone who ever served in the presidency could be accused
by his critics of indulging in bad conduct. The founding fathers
did not list that or any specific act of misbehavior _ except
treason and bribery _ as grounds for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   It is ironic that part the genius of the Constitution is that it
is vague and ambiguous on several key matters that were left to
interpretation by future generations. For example, the Constitution
does not specify that the Supreme Court has the right of judicial
review by which it can declare laws enacted by Congress and signed
by the president unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   But John Marshall, the greatest of the chief justices, assumed
that authority in 1803 in a historic case, Marbury vs. Madison.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall said the Constitution was ``intended to endure for ages
to come and, consequently, to be adapted to the various crises of
human affairs.'' That it has done.
</P>
<P>
   The House has two good men at the helm of the impeachment
investigation _ Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde of Michigan
and ranking minority member John Conyers Jr., also of Michigan.
Both have vowed to protect the Constitution, but being politicians
they will sometimes be guided by partisanship.
</P>
<P>
   It might help if occasionally they would settle their
differences over some good bourbon just as Truman and Black once
did.

CONGRESS, ADMINISTRATION SEEK DEAL ON IMF FUNDING 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Alarmed that their foot-dragging could drive
international financial markets into still deeper turmoil, the
Clinton administration and congressional Republicans said they were
working frantically Wednesday to agree on legislation to provide
$18 billion in new funding to the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   While both sides insisted that a deal was still not a sure
thing, White House officials and congressional leaders agreed on
the urgency of additional funds for the IMF as it attempts to avert
a global financial meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   The most important remaining question, they said, is what sort
of restrictions _ if any _ should be put on future lending by the
IMF, which has been harshly criticized by both Republicans and
Democrats for mismanaging the global economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of IMF funds is central to negotiations intended to
avert a shutdown of the federal government this weekend, when
funding for most of the government is scheduled to run out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have some distance to go, but I think we're making
some progress,'' said White House spokesman Joe Lockhart when asked
about the negotiations over the IMF funds. ``I think there remain
some stumbling blocks.''
</P>
<P>
   After meeting Wednesday with White House budget officials, Rep.
Bob Livingston, R-La., the chairman of the House Appropriations
Committee, said that ``the tough drafting is over'' on compromise
legislation to provide the additional money to the IMF.
</P>
<P>
   But the top congressional Democrat in the negotiations, Rep.
David Obey of Wisconsin, warned that the negotiations with the
White House could still break down and that ``we're a long way from
signing anything.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Earlier this week, President Clinton criticized Congress for
delaying approval of the new funds to the IMF, saying that failure
to provide the money is like ``refusing to supply the fire
department with water while the fire is burning,'' given the
precarious state of the world economy.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has already approved the full $18 billion line of
credit for the IMF that was requested by the Clinton administration
to replenish reserve accounts that were emptied as the IMF
attempted to bail out the economies of Russia and Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The House, though, has approved only $3.4 billion of the
requested funding. House Republican leaders, facing pressure from
conservative members of their party who wonder whether the
international economic crisis is proof that the IMF does more harm
than good, say they will approve the rest of the money only if
strict new conditions are imposed on future loans by the IMF.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans have demanded less secrecy in IMF lending
decisions, an end to below-market loans to foreign governments and
shorter-repayment terms, with perhaps a one-year maximum.
</P>
<P>
   ``The IMF has the Midas touch in reverse _ virtually every
country it tried to help has become worse off from the
experience,'' said House Majority Leader Dick Armey, who led
efforts earlier this year to block the full $18 billion in funding.
``Full funding of an unreformed IMF would be recklessly
irresponsible.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House has resisted the so-called reform measures,
saying it is improper for the United States to attempt to dictate
policy to a multinational agency like the IMF.
</P>
<P>
   White House and congressional officials said that under a likely
compromise, the IMF would face some restrictions on its lending,
with the Treasury required to certify progress by the IMF in
implementing a variety of loan reforms. But they said the
conditions would not be nearly as onerous as those initially
demanded by House Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional officials say the House leadership has shown a new
willingness to resolve the IMF issue _ and to end a variety of
other funding disputes with the White House _ in hopes of
preventing a government shutdown this weekend that might distract
from the impeachment investigation of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Other nations that lend money to the IMF have warned that if the
United States failed to provide the full $18 billion, they might
well reduce their own contributions, which could leave the IMF
short of the $90 billion that it says it needs to deal with
economic crises sweeping across the developing world.

IGUANAS SAIL FROM GUADALOUPE TO ANGUILLA AND INTO HISTORY

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fifteen iguanas on a tangle of waterlogged trees, tossed into
the Caribbean Sea by a hurricane, have apparently sailed 200 miles
from Guadeloupe to Anguilla and into biological history, scientists
say. Their report, being published Thursday in the journal Nature,
has amazed scientists, who have been arguing since early this
century about whether such journeys were even remotely possible,
let alone observable.
</P>
<P>
   By documenting the 1995 voyage of the 15 large, land-loving
creatures _ enough to form a new population _ the report provides
the first clear-cut evidence in support of biologists who argue
that seemingly impossible journeys like this could have been an be
important avenue for the dispersal of species around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a major invasion,'' said Dr. Ellen Censky, a reptile
expert who has worked on Anguilla and was the lead author of the
paper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a phone call saying iguanas had come onto the island,''
said Dr. Censky, now director of the Connecticut State Museum of
Natural History at the University of Connecticut. ``My first
thought was that that couldn't have happened. Then somebody sent a
snapshot. I thought, `My God, `that's it, that's it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James Brown, ecologist and biogeographer at the University
of New Mexico, said: ``It's a spectacular observation. Some of the
things nature can do are pretty incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   The journey of the iguanas began in September 1995 when two
powerful hurricanes moved through the eastern Caribbean. A month
later the iguanas, fearsome-looking creatures up to 4 feet long
that resemble dinosaurs, washed up on Anguilla's shores on an
immense raft of trees, the Nature paper reported.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Censky said the lizards, which rest in trees, were probably
blown down with them into the sea. She and her colleagues studied
the tracks of the two hurricanes, Luis and Marilyn, and ocean
currents and decided that the lizards probably came from
Guadeloupe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was completely surprised to see iguanas coming,'' Cleve
Webster, a fisherman on Anguilla, said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Webster, who witnessed the invasion with his brother while they
were checking lobster traps, said, ``One iguana, he was on a log
and the length of his tail was hanging over into the water.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Censky, along with Dr. Judy Dudley, a U.N. volunteer in
Anguilla, and Karim Hodge, an employee with the Anguilla National
Trust, interviewed eyewitnesses to the iguana landing and then
tracked and monitored the iguanas as they dispersed. Dr. Censky
said they were able to verify 15 animals, but suspected there were
more. Identifying the lizards, known as green iguanas, as outsiders
was simple, researchers said. They have a blue-green coloration and
dark rings around their tails, making them easily distinguishable
from the other iguana species on the island, which is brown and has
a plain tail.
</P>
<P>
   Though the arriving iguanas appear to have been weak, dehydrated
and, in some cases, injured, a number survived. In March,
researchers said they found what appeared to be a pregnant female
iguana, the last element of a successful colonization of a new
species, which made the observation of the rafting significant.
Because the animals appear to be reproducing, the researchers said
they believed the new arrivals had established themselves, though
other scientists said it was still too soon to tell.
</P>
<P>
   While some Anguillans are concerned about the possible
ecological impact of the new lizards on the island, Dr. Censky said
she was not because their arrival and any changes brought by them
would be entirely natural.
</P>
<P>
   The new study bolsters the claims of those, like Dr. Blair
Hedges, an evolutionary biologist at Pennsylvania State University,
who have been advocating this type of rafting as a major
explanation for the distribution of animals on islands in the
Caribbean and elsewhere. Isolated ocean islands like the Hawaiian
islands would be devoid of terrestrial animals were it not for
rafting, or the transportation of species by people.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my mind, it's not unexpected,'' Hedges said. ``If we can
see green iguanas land on Anguilla in 1998, just think of all the
storms in all the millions of years and there is a real probability
of getting anywhere in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Other researchers, like Ross MacPhee, curator of mammalogy at
the American Museum of Natural History, while acknowledging that
rafting clearly can occur, were not sold on its wholesale
importance. MacPhee said he still thought ancient land bridges,
stretches of land long since disappeared that are hypothesized to
have connected islands in the Caribbean to South America, were
likely to be a much more important mechanism for getting animals to
islands.
</P>
<P>
   MacPhee said land bridges were particularly important for
mammals that did not tolerate starvation or dehydration as well as
reptiles.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't have to infer little drowned rats hanging desperately
on to tree trunks,'' he said, ``to explain why the faunas look the
way they do.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In fact, rafting is just one of a number of seemingly outlandish
mechanisms, which researchers have had to infer to explain how
different creatures have arrived where they are today. Among the
harder-to-believe explanations have been geologically implausible
land bridges or the suggestion that fish might have been swept up
in tornadoes and moved across land to establish themselves in other
bodies of water.
</P>
<P>
   Rafting, for some, was equally hard to believe until now. While
there have been many records of single, usually small, animals
drifting about the ocean, it takes two to set up a new population
(unless one is a pregnant female).
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Censky said, however, that the only previous evidence that
multiple animals might have rafted together was a 30-year-old paper
documenting three toads found floating on a log in the middle of a
lake. ``It wasn't even over-the-sea rafting,'' Dr. Censky said.
</P>
<P>
   But in biogeography, a field that by its very nature seems to
invite wild speculation, the seemingly wild explanations are often
confirmed, as in the report Thursday. Years ago, the suggestion
that some species are where they are because the continents
themselves moved was met with the most intense ridicule. Today it
is dogma, leaving the theory's early proponents with the last
laugh. Researchers advice? Expected the unexpected.
</P>
<P>
   ''Over the long term,'' said Brown of the University of New
Mexico, ``improbable events become highly likely. Not everything is
going to get everywhere, but things will definitely end up in
surprising places.''

COMMENTARY: JANET RENO'S HUANG  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM SAFIRE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Remember John Huang?
</P>
<P>
   He's the banker who was placed by Indonesia's Riady family in
the corrupted Clinton Commerce Department. For 18 months he read
top-secret cable traffic, was briefed 37 times by the CIA, viewed
500 pieces of raw intelligence _ and made 261 calls to the Lippo
banks. He frequently slipped across the street to a Riady banker's
``drop'' to send and receive faxes and packages that did not appear
on Commerce records.
</P>
<P>
   Huang also paid 67 recorded visits to the White House complex.
After deceptively signing in as a visitor to the president's
secretary, he met in the Oval Office with his new and old bosses,
Bill Clinton and James Riady. Clinton had Bruce Lindsey arrange
with Harold Ickes to reassign Huang to the DNC, where he raised $2
million from illegal Asian sources.
</P>
<P>
   That fund-raising scandal was first noted in this space two
years ago. The Clinton Department of Justice botched the
investigation. When FBI director Louis Freeh complained in a
27-page legal memo about the need for independent counsel to
replace the fumbling ``Public Integrity'' time-server, Lee Radek,
Attorney General Janet Reno refused and instead brought in Charles
La Bella, a San Diego prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   La Bella determined in a 100-page report that the law called for
an independent counsel. When Reno refused to honor a lawful
congressional subpoena to examine policy recommendations in the
Freeh and La Bella reports, the government Oversight Committee
voted her in contempt. To palliate Senate and House leaders, she
read selections from the reports taking issue with her judgment,
but would not hand them over.
</P>
<P>
   Then this: According to ``a senior Justice official,'' reported
Roberto Suro of The Washington Post, ``some investigators have
concluded that Huang does not have information that would support
the prosecution of the Democratic officials who received and spent
the funds he raised or the White House officials who promoted his
career in Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   Huang home free? But nobody at Justice has interrogated him in
these two years. Although he has taken the Fifth Amendment to duck
Congress, he has never had to exercise his rights against
self-incrimination to Reno's parade of hamstrung prosecutors.
``Regarding the Department of Justice,'' his attorney, Ty Cobb,
tells me, ``John Huang has not had the occasion to take the
Fifth.''
</P>
<P>
   Imagine that: With no questions asked of the untouchable Huang,
a ``senior Justice official'' reports investigators ``concluded''
this essential witness has nothing to say about Clinton-Riady
dealings. Justice is reportedly considering giving Huang immunity
to go after small fry, thereby protecting the president.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in a burst of sweet reason, chairman Dan Burton of
House Oversight this week offered to find Reno in ``belated
compliance'' if she answers specific questions about the suppressed
reports.
</P>
<P>
   When Burton asks for ``all statements related to whether any
investigation is being delayed because of who the subject of the
investigation is,'' he means La Bella's conclusion about Reno's
perverse interpretation requiring more evidence than normal before
investigating a high White House official: ``If these allegations
involved anyone other than (name redacted, maybe Ickes), an
investigation would have commenced months ago without hesitation.''
</P>
<P>
   And when Burton asks for any statements that Justice ``has taken
steps to refrain from investigating any individual,'' he must want
to see La Bella's charge about ``the contortions the department has
gone through'' to avoid pursuing allegations against Clinton and
his top aides.
</P>
<P>
   Congress seeks neither grand jury material nor a prosecutorial
road map, but Reno will probably stiff oversighters again; she sees
the protest of the professionals as too damning for public
consumption. And Lee Radek must be chortling at Reno's narrow
construal of Congress' subpoena: because members did not
specifically ask for the report's addendum, they are not getting
even an oral description of Radek's point-by-point rebuttal,
followed by a sharp reply to that cover-up from La Bella.
</P>
<P>
   Small wonder the House refuses to limit the impeachment inquiry
to lying under oath about sex. There's more to Clinton's
fund-raising lawbreaking than meets the FBI.

 &HT;    Gun boy brought to school fires in front of kindergarteners
 &HT;    By Delbert Ellerton
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JONESBORO, Ga. _ The James H. Brown Elementary fifth-grader
eagerly awaited the times he could help the kindergarteners in his
school. It was his reward _ a privilege he earned by keeping quiet
in class and following the rules.
</P>
<P>
   But on Wednesday, as the 11-year-old student stood before his
smaller classmates to read a storybook, he broke one of the most
serious rules a school imposes. Tucked into the back of his pants'
waist was a loaded .357 magnum handgun. As he backed against the
ladder to a loft used by the youngsters as a quiet place to read,
the gun fired downward. The bullet tore through the fifth-grader's
Boy Scout shirt-tail and grazed his buttocks and calf before
peeling away a hole of blue carpet and shattering on the cement
floor underneath.
</P>
<P>
   No one was seriously injured. The boy, whose identity has not
been released because he is a minor, was treated for injuries at
Southern Regional Medical Center and later taken to the Clayton
County Juvenile Detention Center. He has been charged with carrying
a concealed weapon and firearm on school property as well as
possession of a firearm by a minor, possession of a weapon on a
school bus and reckless conduct, said Clayton County police Capt.
Doug Jewett.
</P>
<P>
   The student, who is in his second year at Brown, also received
an immediate 10-day suspension and will likely face a minimum
one-year expulsion, pending the findings of a disciplinary
tribunal, said Walter Pierce, Clayton schools director of student
services. The Georgia Department of Education has a zero-tolerance
policy requiring a one-year explusion for any student found with a
gun.
</P>
<P>
   Just how the fifth-grader got hold of the gun is still a
mystery, one police are continuing to investigate. The boy told
police he found it in the woods near a playhouse behind his home.
The boy's foster parents said they do not own a gun, said Brown
principal Nancy McCorkle.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's older brother, a sixth-grader at Mundy's Mill Middle
School, said the boy had bragged the night before that he had a
gun, said Mundy's Mill Principal Nancy Wells. The brother said he
didn't take the boy seriously because the boy often talks about
guns, Wells said.
</P>
<P>
   But there was a gun. In fact, there were two, though only one
was brought to school. Jewett said the boy told police he also
found a Mossburg 12-gauge shotgun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Officers found the shotgun _ which was loaded with two shells
_ where he said he put it, `` Jewett said. Both guns were taken as
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The incident at Brown Elementary School, a school of 900
students in Clayton County, preceded a news conference scheduled
for today by the Georgia PTA to focus attention on the National Day
of Concern about Young People and Gun Violence. The event is a
National PTA initiative to reduce school violence. Included is a
pledge by students to not bring weapons to school, said Leisa
Martin, director of the Georgia PTA's District 16, which includes
Clayton County. In some counties, participation is systemwide. In
Clayton County, participation is left up to individual schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a problem with kids bringing guns in,'' said Martin.
``We're not trying to put our heads in the sand. We know there is a
problem. Parents need to know that there's the potential for a
weapon to be brought to school.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin said she fears the incident and others like it could lead
to metal detectors in the schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to spark parent concerns,'' Martin said. ``This
is an elementary school.''
</P>
<P>
   Although this is the first time Brown Elementary has discovered
a weapon on its premises, it is not the first time in Georgia that
elementary students have brought weapons to school. Incidents
reported in the metro area and other parts of the state have
involved students as young as those in first and second grades.
</P>
<P>
   School officials say they believe the Brown Elementary student
brought the gun to school to show off but not to harm anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a bright child. He's a smart child,'' said Wendy Zelatel,
the boy's fifth-grade teacher and the one who had signed an
agreement with him, letting him work with kindergartners as a
reward for good behavior. ``It's very surprising to me that he did
this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He likes to come down to help the kindergarten boys and
girls,'' said Pam Carey, the kindergarten teacher the boy was
assisting.
</P>
<P>
   When the gun fired, Carey did not know what it was, and she
first suspected that an electrical transformer had just blown.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden I heard this really loud noise,'' Carey said.
``He said, 'What was that noise? I'm going to have a heart
attack.''
</P>
<P>
   Carey thought the lights might be going out any minute, but then
noticed the spot on the floor. That's when she checked his back and
found the gun.
</P>
<P>
   ``He moved his foot and there was this spot,'' said Carey.
</P>
<P>
   School officials reacted quickly to the situation, dispatching a
team of administrators and four additional counselors to the
school. Students were told that something had happened that caused
a loud bang, however, they were not told that a gun had fired in
the school. The kindergartners had thought it was firecrackers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want to excite them,'' McCorkle said.
</P>
<P>
   Parents were notified and some came by to get their children.
McCorkle sent letters home to each of the parents informing them of
what had happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just think, 'God, it could have been worse,''' said Lynda
Daniel, who oversees Brown and a number of other schools for the
Clayton school system.
</P>
<P>
   At least one parent was on a routine visit to the school to see
his son when he saw news media and wondered what was going on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just found out about it,'' said parent Larry Smith. ``Ah
man, I'm sorry, that's a trip . . . not at Brown, it's a good
school. That's amazing. It's a real shock. You never expect that to
happen here at Brown. Brown's so mild and meek and easy-going.''

COLLEGE TUITION UP 4 PERCENT, OUTPACING INFLATION

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The cost of a college education rose by about 4 percent this
year, two and a half times the current rate of inflation, 1.6
percent, maintaining a pattern of the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cost of attending college presents a steadily rising
challenge to many Americans, particularly the most financially
disadvantaged,'' said Donald Stewart, president of the College
Board, a national nonprofit association, which released its annual
survey of college fees.
</P>
<P>
   But Stewart said disproportionate attention to the small number
of elite colleges in the $30,000-a-year range obscured the fact
that most students at four-year colleges and universities paid less
than $4,000 a year for tuition and fees.
</P>
<P>
   The new data show that this year at four-year private
institutions, students are paying an average of $14,508, up 5
percent, while those at four-year public institutions are paying an
average of $3,243, a 4 percent increase. At two-year private
institutions, prices rose 4 percent, to $7,333 and 4 percent at
two-year public institutions, to $1,633 on average.
</P>
<P>
   College administrators made much of the fact that after
double-digit increases for tuition in the 1980s and early 1990s,
this was the fourth year in a row with an increase of 4 percent to
5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution,
said he was amazed that the price of college continued to outstrip
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm surprised by this, especially among the more modest
institutions, given the evidence that people in their 20s find it
so much easier to find jobs,'' Burtless said. ``You'd have thought
that with some people deciding not to go to college that would
increase pressure on colleges to reduce costs.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Gladieux, executive director for policy analysis at the
College Board, said he was ``pretty sure a couple years ago that
consumer pressure would pull the cost of private colleges down.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But it hasn't,'' Gladieux said. ``The market for higher
education is so robust. People know that the best life chances and
jobs come through college education.''
</P>
<P>
   He and others pointed out that children of the baby boom
generation were coming of college age and that college applications
were up.
</P>
<P>
   George Rupp, president of Columbia University, said one of the
biggest costs for him and other administrators was updating
dormitories and dining halls to keep up with the demands of
students and their parents for standards that increasingly seek to
match those of hotels and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   The College Board data show costs for room and board to have
increased 3 percent to 5 percent this year. Slightly more than
one-quarter of full-time four-year undergraduate students live on
campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was nice to go for 100 years at a stretch without having to
change the infrastructure,'' L. Jay Oliva, president of New York
University, said of the conditions offered for generations by many
universities.
</P>
<P>
   David Warren, president of the National Association of
Independent Colleges and Universities, said colleges and
universities were looking at ways to reduce fees further but were
worried about affecting quality by increasing student-faculty
ratios and reducing laboratory use.
</P>
<P>
   Among the steps these institutions are using or considering,
Warren said, is hiring contractors for dining services, grounds
maintenance and bookstores. While this approach can be
cost-effective, the resulting job loss disrupts the sense of
community that many colleges consider vital.
</P>
<P>
   Peter McPherson, president of Michigan State University in East
Lansing, Mich., said fees there were up 2.3 percent, the fifth year
that his institution has kept its increases at or near the rate of
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   This achievement has been possible partly through state aid that
has surpassed the inflation rate but also, McPherson said, because
of changes like selling the bookstore to an outside company _ the
store used to lose $500,000 a year but now earns that amount _ and
improving its campus hotel and convention center to attract more
business.
</P>
<P>
   The College Board survey shows significant regional differences
in private college costs, with the highest average, $19,211, in New
England and the lowest, at $10,701, in the Southwest. These
differences were largely matters of the cost of heating and the age
of the institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Financial aid to students is now at a record $60 billion, a 6
percent increase over the previous year after adjusting for
inflation, but most of the increase is in the form of loans rather
than grants and most of the increased borrowing is unsubsidized.
Loans now represent 60 percent of aid, compared with just over 40
percent in 1980-81.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton Wednesday signed into law a rate cut for
student loans, bringing it to 7.46 percent, down from more than 8
percent last year and its lowest level in 17 years. Under the new
law, a typical student borrower at a four-year college, graduating
with $13,000 in debt, would save about $700 over a 10-year
repayment period.

ITALIAN PREMIER BATTLES COMMUNIST-BACKED THREAT TO POWER 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Arguing that Italy cannot afford a return to political
instability, Prime Minister Romano Prodi pleaded with Parliament
Wednesday to keep his splintering center-left majority intact.
</P>
<P>
   ``Italy cannot enter the monetary union weakened or uncertain,''
Prodi said, referring to the single European monetary unit, the
euro, which is to be introduced on Jan. 1. ``We do not want Italy
to be the weak link.''
</P>
<P>
   The threat to Prodi's government, a center-left coalition that
relies on the support of Communists for its majority in Parliament,
became real last weekend when Fausto Bertinotti, the secretary
general of the Communist Refounding Party, withdrew his support for
the 1999 budget _ and for the government.
</P>
<P>
   But that rejection was undercut by dissension within the
Communist leadership. Armando Cossutta, the more moderate president
of the party, resigned, saying he did not want to be responsible
for opening the door for a center-right government to replace the
current one.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Cossutta urged his followers to stick with Prodi,
saying: ``I believe the party should heed Prodi's appeal to support
the government. Abandoning the government is not a courageous act.
It would mean surrendering our responsibility to defend the
interests of the weakest sections of society.''
</P>
<P>
   Bertinotti, however, made clear he has no intention of wavering,
describing Prodi's request that he reconsider ``insulting.'' And he
threatened to expel any members who followed Cossutta's example.
</P>
<P>
   There are 21 Communist deputies who share Cossutta's view and
who together could bring Prodi within just a few votes of a
majority.
</P>
<P>
   After two and a half years, Prodi's government is the second
longest lasting in the postwar period. By making entrance into the
European currency system his primary goal, Prodi managed to raise
taxes and cut the deficit and state borrowing, and still keep his
fragile coalition intact. But once Italy made the grade last
spring, dissension and power struggles sprang back to life.
</P>
<P>
   The embattled prime minister, who is to return to Parliament on
Thursday, is planning to demand a vote of confidence on Friday.
Should he fail to rally enough votes from dissident Communists, he
would have to resign.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro could either ask
him to try to form a new majority, or could ask another political
leader _ or even a nonpolitician _ to try to patch together a new
coalition. If all that fails, Italy could be plunged into early
elections before November.
</P>
<P>
   Prodi Wednesday used the last-ditch argument with which he hopes
to rally support.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot accept this, or believe that you really want this
government to fail,'' Prodi said, speaking directly to Bertinotti.
``I cannot believe you want to hand over the country to the forces
that were defeated in 1996,'' a reference to Silvio Berlusconi, the
conservative former prime minister, and his allies.
</P>
<P>
   Bertinotti, who said he rejected the 1999 budget because it did
not include a 35-hour workweek or sufficient measures to combat
unemployment in the south, apparently was not swayed.
</P>
<P>
   It is not the first time that the Communist Refounding Party, a
group of hard-line leftists who broke with mainstream Communists
after the collapse of the Soviet Union, have pushed Prodi to the
brink. The party forced Prodi to offer his resignation last year
over the budget, but had to backpedal after their own rank-and-file
protested.

SURVIVOR OF ALLEGED MASSACRE IS MOVED OUT OF YUGOSLAVIA  
(JT)

<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ In what could be an important move for
the prosecution of suspected war crimes in Kosovo, the man who says
he is the sole survivor of a mass execution in his village was
moved from Yugoslavia Wednesday by international monitors.
</P>
<P>
   The man, Selman Morina, who has a serious bullet wound in the
left thigh, was accompanied by his wife and eight children on a
drive to Skopje, capital of Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   Morina was moved after Richard Holbrooke, the American envoy,
had asked President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia for permission
for Morina to be taken out of Yugoslavia. Milosevic, who has failed
to yield to pressure from Washington to pull back his troops in
Kosovo, quickly acceded to the request for Morina's release,
American officials said.
</P>
<P>
   There were concerns that Morina, an ethnic Albanian whose wound
was infected, might die without proper medical help. Morina was
afraid to go to a local hospital, because the Serbian authorities
run medical centers in Kosovo and often discriminate against and
threaten ethnic Albanian patients.
</P>
<P>
   The mass execution in Morina's village occurred as Yugoslav
soldiers and the Serbian police continued their efforts to crush a
rebellion in Kosovo by ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent of
the Serbian province's population.
</P>
<P>
   Morina's safety was also in jeopardy because he could become a
pivotal witness in proceedings against the Serbian police, who are
posted in the hills around his village in the central Drenica
region.
</P>
<P>
   Morina told Western diplomats and reporters last week the
details of how he and 13 other men had been told to lie face down
with their heads pointing to a garden fence and were shot by a
Serbian police officer. He survived, after having been shot in the
left thigh and arm, he said, by playing dead.
</P>
<P>
   Two diplomats and a human rights researcher said they found his
story convincing, in part because of its consistency, coherence and
detail.
</P>
<P>
   The execution was on Sept. 26 at Golubovac, the day of the
massacre of 18 women, children and elderly members of the Deliaj
family at the nearby village of Gornje Obrinje. The two mass
killings occurred three days after the United Nations Security
Council had passed a resolution that called on both sides in the
conflict to cease hostilities and on the Serbian government to
investigate massacres.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department took a special interest in Morina's case
and seized Holbrooke's meeting with Milosevic on possible NATO
strikes as an opportunity to press for his removal. The American
ambassador at large for war crimes, David Scheffer, said having
Morina out of Yugoslavia was ``very helpful.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We were determined to get him out,'' Scheffer said. ``He
needed to receive excellent medical care and is needed for witness
testimony at the international court.''
</P>
<P>
   The chief prosecutor for the tribunal in The Hague, Louise
Arbour, decided in June that the events in Kosovo constituted an
armed conflict in which the laws of war applied. The fighting, Ms.
Arbour said, was not just an action against terrorism, as the Serbs
contended.
</P>
<P>
   Scheffer said cases before the court concerning Kosovo would
most likely concentrate on the chain of command in the police and
military. Morina's testimony could help on such questions.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has insisted that the tribunal has no jurisdiction in
Kosovo and has thwarted its attempts to send forensic experts to
the province.
</P>
<P>
   A Russian, a European and an American monitor accompanied
Morina, who could walk, only painfully and with support, as the
party drove out of Kosovo. He had been resting on a mattress on the
floor of his house since the shooting and received only rudimentary
medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was nervous but happy that some kind of conclusion had been
arrived at,'' one monitor said. ``I'm sure he's aware that his
value as a witness is significant.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1995, a whiff of revolution was in the air in Silicon Valley.
The Internet offered a new deal in computing, a fresh opportunity
for entrepreneurs to try to break Microsoft Corp.'s firm grip on
the personal computer software business. Leading the challenge was
Netscape Communications Corp., whose software for browsing the
World Wide Web had ignited the Internet boom.
</P>
<P>
   James Clark, Netscape's chairman, spoke boldly of attacking
Microsoft head-on. He borrowed imagery from the movie ``Star
Wars,'' referring to Microsoft as the Death Star and Netscape as
the leader of a rebel alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft answered with a vengeance. It dispatched hundreds of
programmers to work on a competing browser and poured millions of
dollars into marketing it. It prodded computer makers and others to
distribute its browser, folded the browser into its
industry-dominant Windows operating system and gave the browser
away free _ a campaign intended to ``cut off their air supply,'' as
a senior Microsoft executive described it.
</P>
<P>
   Not only competitors like Netscape have encountered Microsoft's
force. Microsoft's partners, its corporate customers and
professional investors who finance new ventures have all collided
with it. In its no-holds-barred push into the Internet software
business, Microsoft has used its market muscle to influence the
behavior of virtually every player in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   A suit by the Justice Department and 20 states, scheduled to go
to trial this month, charges that Microsoft at times went too far _
and violated antitrust laws. Previously unreported details about
incidents in the suit and the other examples provide a more
complete picture of Microsoft in action.
</P>
<P>
   _ When Compaq Computer Corp. considered loading Netscape's
browser instead of Microsoft's on its personal computers, Microsoft
threatened to stop selling its Windows operating system to Compaq.
The company quickly changed its mind.
</P>
<P>
   _ After Spyglass Inc. began supplying Microsoft with its early
browser technology, Microsoft announced that it would give away its
browser free. The timing came as a rude surprise to its partner
Spyglass. The company lost most of its revenue almost overnight, as
the technology, which it had also been licensing to companies
besides Microsoft, suddenly became available free.
</P>
<P>
   _ When America Online Inc., which competes fiercely with
Microsoft's online service and electronic commerce divisions, went
shopping for browser technology, Microsoft made an offer that was
too good to pass up: If America Online used Microsoft's browser as
the main one for its millions of subscribers, Microsoft would give

   _ When Intel Corp. began developing its own Internet software,
Microsoft complained. Intel, the leading maker of the
microprocessors that serve as the electronic brains on most
personal computers running Windows, pulled back. The chip maker
decided that its lucrative hand-in-glove partnership with Microsoft
took priority.
</P>
<P>
   _ Microsoft's reach in computing has become so pervasive that
nearly every year now, Silicon Valley's top venture capitalists
meet privately with a team of top Microsoft executives to learn
about the company's plans. The goal, one venture investor observed,
was to ``stay out of the way of the steamroller.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft adamantly denies that it has broken any laws in these
or similar situations, and insists its actions are guided by its
main corporate goal of bringing new technology inexpensively and
conveniently to the millions of people who use its software.
</P>
<P>
   Most people in the computer industry say that living in
Microsoft's world means routinely making accommodations to it.
Microsoft's power emanates from its near-monopoly on the market for
personal computer operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because it owns the operating system, Microsoft is the
essential utility of the information age,'' said James Moore,
president of Geopartners Research Inc., a technology consulting
firm. ``It acts as a kind of gatekeeper to the pipeline of
computing innovation, sitting there and deciding whether to help
some innovation or slow it down.''
</P>
<P>
   In the trial, the government will contend that Microsoft
presented Netscape with an all-or-nothing offer, according to
people who have been questioned in the federal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors are expected to assert that the Microsoft proposal
had several elements, both incentives and requirements. Microsoft,
according to the people questioned by the government, would invest
in Netscape, taking a 15 to 20 percent stake, give Netscape
technical information and fine-tune Microsoft's operating systems
so that Netscape's software would run better on Windows.
</P>
<P>
   In return, these people say, Netscape would give Microsoft a
seat on its board, license its technology to Microsoft, give
Microsoft advance knowledge of its product-development efforts and
not make a browser for the next generation of the Microsoft
operating system, Windows 95, which was shipped two months after
the June 1995 meeting.
</P>
<P>
   And Microsoft, these people added, did what it has always denied
it does _ used access to its technology as a powerful lever in
business negotiations, by offering Netscape preferential access to
the Windows ``application program interfaces,'' or APIs, the links
that enable other companies' programs to run smoothly on the
Windows operating system. By
</P>
<P>
   turning down the deal, Netscape, they say, would not have that
preferred access to Microsoft technology _ a threat that Microsoft
fiercely denies making.
</P>
<P>
   Had Netscape accepted Microsoft's offer, it would have had
Microsoft's money and its endorsement. Netscape would have also
been free to sell its browser for use in earlier versions of
Windows and for use on other operating systems like Apple's
Macintosh and Unix, a powerful system used mainly in corporations
and research labs.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if we had licensed our technology to Microsoft and stepped
aside, the best we could have hoped for was becoming a company with
sales of $100 million or so and hoping to be bought out by
Microsoft,'' said Clark, who founded Silicon Graphics Inc., a
computer graphics pioneer, before starting Netscape. ``We didn't
start Netscape for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Netscape's strategy is to avoid head-to-head competition
with Microsoft whenever possible. ``Don't do something that is in
Microsoft's path _ that's the lesson learned,'' observed Clark.
</P>
<P>
   Silicon Valley's venture capitalists, the investors who finance
many high-tech startups, generally follow the same approach these
days. Yet that still leaves ample room to prosper. For while
competing directly with Microsoft is dangerous, the software
industry as a whole is an engine of wealth creation, job generation
and technical innovation.
</P>
<P>
   And there is an ambivalent side to the venture community's
relationship with Microsoft. For if a start-up cannot steer clear
of Microsoft entirely, the favored option is to be bought out by
Microsoft, which has scooped up many fledgling companies as a way
of acquiring promising technology and people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft understands start-up innovation and how to co-opt
start-up innovation better than any other high-tech company,'' said
James Breyer, managing partner of Accel Partners, a venture capital
firm.
</P>
<P>
   As Microsoft has grown, it has come to be seen not merely as a
competitor but as a force of nature that shapes the business
environment, like a weather front.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft is incredibly pervasive,'' said Stewart Alsop, a
partner with New Enterprise Associates, a venture capital firm in
Menlo Park, Calif. At the board meetings of the companies in which
his firm has invested, two issues always come up, he said: ``One is
the price of the company's stock, and the other is what Microsoft
is going to do.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Ridge Theater is an avant-garde company with the
unbuttoned charm of ex-hippies who have made a name in experimental
theater for staging multimedia spectacles with tidy, Swiss-watch
precision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking at us, you'd think we're aging slackers,'' says Bob
McGrath, 43, the group's artistic director. ``But I take great
pains to get things perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Finding order in ``Chaos,'' a new opera the Ridge is staging at
the Kitchen, through Oct. 24, seems a suitable task for the
company, which for 11 years has favored stories that accent the
sinister side of popular culture. The strange realm of chaos theory
is the subject of this new science fiction opera, ``with a pop
feel,'' said its composer Michael Gordon, the co-artistic director
of the eclectic Bang on a Can Festival every year at Lincoln
Center. The librettist is Matthew Maguire, co-artistic director of
the experimental Creation Production Company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chaos,'' produced by the Ridge, the Creation Production
Company and the Kitchen, tells a tale in 25 scenes over 80 minutes
of two young physicists who do battle with the nasty Dr. Aguabone
(modeled on J. Robert Oppenheimer). When the scientists Marie and
Pierre Curie come to their rescue in the ``realm of chaos,'' the
younger couple are able to conquer their foe by trapping his image
on a video monitor.
</P>
<P>
   Aguabone shouts, ``It's the devil's pinball!'' _ an apt
description of a Ridge theatrical event. Troupe members may look
like do-nothing denizens of a pinball arcade, but their intricate
shows can evoke the feeling of being inside an enormous pinball
machine.
</P>
<P>
   While the company maintains a roster of artistic associates who
perform in many of their productions, the Ridge is primarily a
design team consisting of Fred Tietz (sets), Laurie Olinder
(slides), Bill Morrison (film) and Howard Thies (lights).
</P>
<P>
   ``No one does what we do,'' said McGrath, who directs the
disparate elements. ``We've found this esthetic where all the parts
cohere to form this hallucinogenic world.''
</P>
<P>
   With no fixed operating budget and no permanent theater space,
Ridge members are in effect stagers for hire who subsist on
occasional teaching jobs and dwindling grant money (they have
received support in the past from the National Endowment for the
Arts and the New York State Council on the Arts). Yet despite
limited funds they have employed dazzling effects rarely seen in
low-budget downtown theater.
</P>
<P>
   A frequent strategy is the use of scrims: screens through which
live action can be viewed or, with a change in lighting, on which
films and slides can be projected. McGrath also tends to double or
triple cast look-alike actors, allowing a character who exits at
stage left to magically reappear at stage right.
</P>
<P>
   In the typical Ridge production, there is the sense that an
observer's gaze is being steered from one center of the action to
another, bringing to mind a circus, if it could be rewound and
played at different speeds.
</P>
<P>
   A recent divorce, however, between the Ridge and a longtime
collaborator, John Moran, has raised questions about who has been
responsible for developing the distinctive look of the troupe's
productions.
</P>
<P>
   A protege of Philip Glass, Moran composes what he calls
techno-operas that Glass describes as ``pure visions.'' Moran has
worked with Ridge on five of his operas over the last 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Glass first met Moran while giving a concert in Lincoln, Neb.
``This kid from the sticks comes up to me with a book of drawings
and a tape,'' the composer recalled. ``I knew right away that Moran
was a gifted composer, a dreamer of the theater. His vision is
specific, but figuring out who directed these McGrath-Moran
collaborations is difficult, if not impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   Paige Snell, who appeared in two early Moran-McGrath projects,
put it bluntly: ``Moran is a solo original artist who needed a
vehicle to manifest his work and Ridge is an effective theatrical
organization. However, Moran is responsible for the esthetic now
associated with Ridge.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of that esthetic seems to have been established in 1988
when Ridge first collaborated with Moran on ``Jack Benny!,'' an
opera made up entirely of fragments from the comedian's television
show and played at different speeds.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, Moran said, ``I was developing a peculiar
style that I still use, a style where the visuals need to match
every sound, down to the footsteps.'' In his operas, performers
frequently lip-synch to pre-recorded, sampled scores.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ridge,'' Moran said, ``fought me every step of the way.
But they did `Jack Benny!' the way I demanded. They said, `Look, we
went to theater school, we know this lip-synching stuff won't
work.' Every idea that is associated with the Ridge, I brought to
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Moran went on to present four more operas under McGrath's
direction, including ``The Manson Family'' at the Serious Fun
Festival at Lincoln Center in 1990, ``Everyday Newt Berman'' at La
Mama in 1993 and ``The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari'' at the American
Repertory Theater in Cambridge, Mass., last year.
</P>
<P>
   Glass said he agreed with Moran that ``Ridge was doing something
else entirely before John.'' But: ``Ridge is terrifically talented.
They took the opportunity to make a mark with Moran. They knew how
to deliver it. John has a point, though, because McGrath blossomed
with his work. I admire them both. Credit is due on all sides.''
</P>
<P>
   Ridge members said they regretted the split with Moran,
describing it in a matter-of-fact manner. ``John wanted more
overall control of the visual aspects and to direct,'' said Thies,
the lighting designer, who has worked with Moran on non-Ridge
projects.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   McGrath, acknowledging that much of Ridge's esthetic over the
years has been associated with Moran's imprint, added: ``We had a
great long run with John. It wasn't so great at the end between us,
but I don't want to deal in negatives. John has genius in him. But
I directed those shows. Directing is about being in rehearsal every
day, about making plays come to life. John had staging ideas, but
the whole idea of scrims and slides and films is ours.''
</P>
<P>
   Moran remembers the long collaboration differently: ``I was 23
and naive when I met them. I had no idea how arts funding was
obtained. They tried to create road signs for producers that said,
`Hey, you want Moran's operas? This is the way: hire Ridge
Theater.' They wouldn't let me talk to producers. I was kept like a
sideshow attraction.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ridge Theater (named for Ridge Street on the Lower East
Side, where McGrath has lived since the theater's inception) began
performing in the mid-1980s as a collective called Pink at downtown
rock clubs between acts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before `Jack Benny!,' we did our share of punk Moliere, but we
did some very serious visual theater,'' said McGrath, who met
Tietz, the set designer, when they were students at Carnegie-Mellon
University.
</P>
<P>
   McGrath noted that he had always been interested in the Russian
director Vsevolod Meyerhold's actor training theory Biomechanics,
and the nonrealistic, gestural movement that defines its style.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, even before Moran appeared on its horizon, Ridge had
shown an interest in the macabre: it had staged a play entitled
``Pound in the Cage,'' which McGrath called ``a dialogue between
Ezra Pound and John Hinckley Jr., the guy who shot Reagan,'' as
well as ``Czolgosz,'' about the assassin of President McKinley, at
P.S. 122.
</P>
<P>
   Given the group's preoccupation with popular culture and
assassins, McGrath said, the 1988 pairing of Ridge and Moran seemed
fortunate. Based on ``Czolgosz,'' their first play with slides and
films, Mark Russell, the executive director of P.S. 122, ``thought
Moran would be a great match for us,'' McGrath said.
</P>
<P>
   Russell remembered that he introduced Moran to McGrath because
``Ridge was a very sharp, up-and-coming company and they had a
fluid style; I thought they would be intrigued by the lip-synching.
In my view, Moran and Ridge put each other on the map.''
</P>
<P>
   Moran said the final straw in a collaboration that had denied
him directing credit was the production of ``The Cabinet of Dr.
Caligari'' in Cambridge with actors from ART. ``Suddenly,'' he
said, ``I really had no involvement. I'd always done the music,
dialogue and about 90 percent of the staging with detailed overhead
maps. `Caligari' ended up two separate pieces _ what McGrath and
Robert Brustein'' _ the artistic director of ART _ ``put together,
and mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Ridge's production of Moran's opera ``Mathew in the School of
Life'' (also at the Kitchen) had captured Brustein's attention in
1994. He invited McGrath and his designers to stage the American
premiere of Susan Sontag's ``Alice in Bed'' in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Brustein described seeing ``Mathew,'' a science-fiction
techno-opera about an android's education: ``I was blown away by
the remarkable stagecraft. I immediately made rash claims about
Moran and the Ridge together being `the future of the theater.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Writing in The New Republic, where he is the theater critic,
Brustein said that the Moran-McGrath collaboration might be
``potentially as important for American performing arts as that of
Philip Glass and Robert Wilson.'' Subsequently, though, he has said
that the Ridge Theater's artistry is apparent when applied to
material not created by Moran.
</P>
<P>
   In April, McGrath and his company will return to ART to stage an
adaptation of Robert Coover's ``Charlie in the House of Rue,'' a
scenario about Charlie Chaplin that marks their third production at
the theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``McGrath has the capacity to be very faithful to a text and
still embroider a whole imaginative life around it,'' Brustein
said. ``He can mold technology and live performance to change a
theater space into a film studio. Through projections and the
doubling of actors, he is able to jump cut, fade and dissolve.''
</P>
<P>
   About the Moran-McGrath split, Brustein said, ``Maybe like
Philip Glass and Robert Wilson, they will go their separate ways
and then work together again.''
</P>
<P>
   Glass agreed. ``Bob Wilson and I worked together, then split for
eight years. McGrath and Moran did beautiful work together, and
they'll do beautiful work apart. I hope it's not the end of this
association.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, McGrath and Ridge are busy. After staging two plays by
Mac Wellman last March, they will do a new Wellman play next year,
based on the paintings of the outsider artist Henry Darger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sought out McGrath,'' said Wellman, ``because he's intensely
visual, but his style is still amenable to language. The company is
fearless in the right way. They don't care if they fit into the
cliches of downtown theater, so they don't. They debunk the
received notion that the avant-garde is dead.''

ECONOMIC SCENE: KEEPING TABS ON LEVELS OF RISK AT BANKS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga.)  (lb) 
 By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Robert Merton and Myron Scholes are smarter than smart. They
know better than anyone else how to think about financial risk. The
proof lies in their Nobel award, which they shared for figuring out
the fiendishly complex math by which to assign precise price tags
to options and other risky investments.
</P>
<P>
   So if Merton and Scholes are so smart, why did the investment
pool that they helped create, Long-Term Capital Management LP,
collapse last month? Apparently the professors are better at
thinking about risk than at managing it.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a scary thought.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of the savings and loans bankruptcies in the
1980s, banks have been told to hold a large cushion of capital. If
losses mount and bring a bank's capital below preset levels,
regulators are required to pounce, forcing management to retrench
or even go out of business.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators might like to monitor the overall risk of a bank's
investment portfolio, but the simple truth is that two nanoseconds
after they exit the examination, the bank could pile on risk with
the use of derivatives _ securities that track stock prices,
interest rates or some other market factor and can quickly rack up
huge gains or losses.
</P>
<P>
   So regulators have turned over the task of monitoring risk to
the bank's managers, checking that they adopt sophisticated models
that can assess risk and set off timely alarms.
</P>
<P>
   That raises the question: Can lowly bank managers do what two
Nobel laureates could not? And if not, should banks with federally
insured deposits be allowed to do business with risky investment
pools, known as hedge funds, like that run by Merton and Scholes?
Put another way, are self-monitoring banks safe?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is almost certainly ``yes.'' The weasel word _ almost
_ cannot be stricken. But neither should it dominate conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Take the case of a bank lending money to a hedge fund. ``So
what?'' asks George Benston, professor of finance at Emory
University. Many of the loans appear to be backed by collateral.
But if not, Benston says, the loans are ``no different from dozens
of other loans that banks make.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The hedge fund may default on the loan.'' he added. ``So may
real-estate developers and morticians. Banks are in the business of
making risky loans.''
</P>
<P>
   Christine Cumming of the New York Federal Reserve Bank points
out that bank ``examiners review a bank's appraisal of its entire
loan portfolio.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Loans are classified according to risk, and the bank's capital
cushion judged accordingly,'' she said. In that sense, loans to
hedge funds are nothing special. The answer to risk, Benston points
out, is diversification. Ms. Cumming adds that among the questions
bank examiners ask is whether the bank has overly committed its
loans to one industry, one client or one region. A diversified
portfolio is a reasonably safe portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   But banks also do derivatives trading with hedge funds _ writing
contracts like options, swaps and currency futures. The banks are
supposed to hold an overall portfolio of derivatives with largely
offsetting risks _ some contracts make money if interest rates
rise, and others lose money if interest rates fall.
</P>
<P>
   Building on the work of Scholes and Merton, banks submit their
overall portfolio to stress tests _ models that ask how the bank's
assets would change if, for example, interest rates were to rise or
fall by two percentage points. If the stress tests reveal that the
financial health of a bank is threatened by possible market moves,
then the managers and the regulators know that the bank must
retrench.
</P>
<P>
   Are stress tests up to any challenge? No one knows for sure,
because they have yet to be tested by any challenge. But Benston
points out, ``There has never been a failure of a bank on account
of derivatives.''
</P>
<P>
   The sophistication of stress tests will have to grow along with
the investment strategies of banks. Stress tests will need to
account for the danger that markets can freeze, preventing banks
from shedding and acquiring derivatives as needed to balance its
risks.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, the combination of large capital cushions,
diversified loans, stress tests and prompt regulatory action has
been enough to keep banks healthy. The system works well to protect
banks against isolated failures _ hedge-fund collapses or Russian
bank defaults.
</P>
<P>
   The system is not well equipped to handle what one government
official calls ``financial Armageddon,'' the simultaneous collapse
of banks in Brazil, Korea, China and everywhere in between, or a
national depression. But the fallout from Armageddon is exactly
what the Federal Reserve System is designed to solve.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, was careful last week to state
that the collapse of Long-Term Capital did not pose a ``systemic
risk'' _ Fedspeak for bank collapse _ but did threaten to ``disrupt
markets'' _ Fedspeak for falling prices of assets, which create
problems for institutions that lack adequate capital, and a
slowdown in bank lending. The upshot is that hedge funds threaten
the nation's banking system only if the regulators fall asleep.

HIGH PRICE OF COLLEGE STRESSING ALL BUT RICHEST IN US 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE ZERNIKE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Paying for college has become increasingly difficult for all but
those families in the highest income levels, according to the
College Board's annual survey of college costs, released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Tuition at four-year public and private colleges and
universities rose 4 percent for the 1998-99 school year, double the
rate of inflation, and made the price of college about 50 percent
higher than a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   While financial aid in both loans and grants rose to $60
billion, students are increasingly relying on loans instead of
grants to cover the cost, meaning debt loads are higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``The share of family income required to pay college expenses
has increased for all families...but it has gone up mostly for
those on the lower rungs,'' said Lawrence Gladieux, an analyst with
the College Board, which also administers college and graduate
school admissions exams. ``Rising costs have a disproportionate
impact on those at the low end of the scale. And most of these
rising costs have to be financed by borrowing. That's what I worry
about as we drift more toward a loan-based student aid system.''
</P>
<P>
   Attending a public, four-year college or university cost 62
percent of a low-income family's earnings and 17 percent of a
middle-income family's earnings last year, the most recent year for
which numbers were available. Sending a child to a private
institution would have consumed 162 percent of a low-income
family's earnings, compared with 44 percent of the earnings of a
middle-income family and 4 percent of the earnings of a high-income
family.
</P>
<P>
   The 4 percent average increase this year means tuition and fees
rose $132 at public four year-institutions, reaching an average of
$3,243. For private, four-year colleges, average tuition and fees
rose $723, up 5 percent to $14,508. Those costs averaged $1,633 at
public two-year colleges, up 4 percent, or $66. A 4 percent
increase also occurred at private two-year colleges, where average
tuition and fees rose $254 to $7,333.
</P>
<P>
   The increase this year is far below the steeper increases of the
1980s, but still means the price of college is much higher than it
was over the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past 17 years, the sticker price has risen 107 percent
at public 4-year colleges, and 104 percent at private 4-year
schools, while median family income has risen 12 percent. Financial
aid has risen 65 percent, but that has not kept pace with the cost
of going to college.
</P>
<P>
   And indebtedness continues to grow. Eighteen years ago, about 55
percent of student financial aid came as grants, which don't have
to be paid back. Now, 60 percent comes in the form of loans.
</P>
<P>
   Pell Grants, the federal financial aid grants for low- and
middle-income students, covered about 35 percent of the cost of a
private 4-year college when they began 25 years ago, and 75 percent
of the cost of a public four year college. Now, those grants
provide only about 15 percent of what it costs to go to private
college, and 30 percent of what it costs to go to public colleges.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the cost of college _ public or private, 4 year or 2
year _ remain highest in New England, with tuition and fees adding
up to an average of $19,211 for a private four year college, and
$12,237 for a private two year college.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, tuition and fees at the 55 schools that make
up the Association of Independent Colleges and Universities of
Massachusetts rose 4 percent from last academic year to the one
that began last month, lower than the national average for private
colleges for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   While they acknowledged the price of college was, in the words
of College Scholarship Service head John Joyce, ``A chunk of change
by any measure,'' college board officials went somewhat on the
defensive, pointing out that most students pay less than $8,000 per
year to go to college, and that the average is skewed by the higher
cost schools like Harvard and Brown Universities. They also said it
costs more to run a college or university than it does most
industries, so comparisons to the rate of inflation, they said, are

MARKET PLACE: CHIP MAKERS MAY BE TURNING THINGS AROUND 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 BY LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Analysts who cover the semiconductor industry have for months
been casting about for some sign that the beleaguered sector had
reached a bottom. So with three or four bits of positive data in
hand, many have seized on the opportunity to declare a turnaround
this week.
</P>
<P>
   Some had already done so last month when Intel Corp. projected
that its third-quarter sales would be 8 percent to 10 percent more
than the $5.9 billion reported in the second quarter, rather than
flat as it had suggested earlier. Intel will report final results
on Oct. 13.
</P>
<P>
   But this week, with Advanced Micro Devices Inc. reporting a
surprise return to profitability, Motorola Inc. projecting new
growth and the Semiconductor Industry Association reporting the
first sequential monthly sales growth since November, the
turnaround chorus gained voices. The association said Wednesday
that worldwide chip sales increased by 1.5 percent in August, to
$9.81 billion, despite continued declines in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, substantial caveats remain. The growth these
companies are reporting is significant, but it is relative to the
severely depressed numbers of recent quarters. Most analysts expect
more positive surprises in the December quarter, particularly for
those companies supplying manufacturers of personal computers, but
no one knows whether a recession will strike next year, and if it
does, whether companies will continue buying PCs to boost
productivity, or shut down all capital spending for the duration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you do have enough pieces of evidence to suggest that
something did change in the June-July time frame,'' said Mark
Edelstone, an analyst with Morgan Stanley. ``PC demand worldwide is
still pretty decent,'' and the glut of inventory that had slowed
microprocessor sales has largely been flushed through the
distribution system, he said. ``I think any semiconductor company
that sells into the PC market will have something upbeat to say,
just as AMD did,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Advanced Micro Devices on Tuesday reported earnings of $1
million, or 1 cent a share, instead of the 11-cent loss analysts
had been expecting. The company attributed its sales growth to its
K6-2 line of microprocessors, which have been gaining market share
from Intel's Pentium and Celeron chips, particularly in PCs priced
less than $1,000. W.J. Sanders III, Advanced Micro's chairman and
chief executive, said that PC sales were healthy almost everywhere,
and that ``the worst is behind us.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Advanced Micro shares slipped 18.75 cents, to
$16.75, anyway, possibly because of investors selling on the news,
possibly because of the perennial worry that the company will not
be able to keep up with Intel in the next product cycle. That is a
serious worry: Intel's manufacturing processes are second to none
and the company outspends Advanced Micro on research and
development by five or six to one.
</P>
<P>
   Intel said Wednesday that its next generation processor,
code-named Merced, is on track for production in mid-2000, and that
its successor, now known as McKinley, will be twice as fast and
available in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Intel's prowess is the reason why Michael Murphy, editor of the
California Technology Stock Letter, is not recommending purchase of
Advanced Micro shares, but he is recommending Intel at current
prices as well as a host of smaller chip companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a unit volume increase going on, and everybody is
saying that prices have stopped declining so rapidly,'' he said.
``That's all it takes to make a turn on a seasonal basis,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The question then becomes ``what happens next year,'' Murphy
said. ``Do we slide into recession and does capital spending just
stop, or does deflation compel people to upgrade PCs, get on the
Internet, and cut costs, before their competitors take them out?''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough to find any other part of the economy showing
double-digit unit growth,'' he added, ``so I think money should
come out of the Coca-Colas and Gillettes and into the Motorolas and
Intels.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Joseph, an analyst with NationsBanc Montgomery
Securities, said the improvement in the industry's health is
subtle, noting that on a year-to-year basis, worldwide
semiconductor shipments were down 16 percent in August, compared
with 17 percent in July.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said, ``it appears as if the semiconductor sector,
aided by stronger demand for microprocessors and memory, has turned
a corner and is now in the initial stages or reaccelerating.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph is also recommending Intel, as well as small networking
chip suppliers like PMC-Sierra Inc., whose prices are down by 50
percent from previous highs. ``The table is really set for a party,
but does anybody care?'' he asked, noting investors' reticence in
buying these stocks. ``Ultimately, investors are going to gravitate
toward value, and to the extent possible, sustainable growth.''

US FILES ANTITRUST SUIT AGAINST CREDIT CARD NETWORKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER G. GOSSELIN   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK -- The Justice Department sued Visa and MasterCard
Wednesday, charging that the nation's two largest credit card
networks are violating federal antitrust laws by blocking banks
from issuing competing cards and by slowing the spread of new,
high-tech ``smart cards.''
</P>
<P>
   Department officials asserted that the lawsuit will give
consumers more choice by, among other things, lifting rules that
bar banks which issue the two cards from offering alternatives like
American Express and Discover. But industry spokesmen shot back
that consumers are already deluged with card offers.
</P>
<P>
   The suit is the product of a two-year investigation of the card
industry, and is the latest step by the department's recently
reinvigorated antitrust division, which, separately, is suing
computer software giant Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Credit cards are not just luxuries. They are an important
financial tool for many Americans,'' Attorney General Janet Reno
told a Washington press conference. ``For millions of people,
competition in the credit card industry is vital.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers have unlimited choices when it comes to credit
cards,'' countered Paul Allen, executive vice president and general
counsel for Visa U.S.A. ``There's no avoiding the mail and phone
calls we get almost daily from a multitude of issuers offering new
incentives, rates and special offers.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice department suit seeks to end joint control of Visa
and MasterCard -- which together account for 75 percent of all
credit card purchases -- by a handful of banking giants that
includes Citicorp and Chase Manhattan Bank USA. But analysts said
that the legal action stops well short of trying to break up the
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The department is trying to change behavior, not smash
institutions,'' said Robert E. Litan, a former member of the
antitrust division now at the Brookings Institution, a Washington
think tank.
</P>
<P>
   The filing of the suit comes at an awkward time for the
financial industry, which is already troubled by rising credit card
delinquencies, declining profits and a fall from Wall Street favor.
The stocks of several card issuers fell sharply Wednesday, among
them Citicorp, down 5 3/16 to 79 13/16, and Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter &AMP; Co., 3 1/4 to 38 7/16.
</P>
<P>
   Banking analysts said that the government has investigated Visa
and Mastercard repeatedly in the past, but has not been able to
make an antitrust case because of the peculiar structure of the
business. Although the two organizations operate the largest credit
card networks, the cards themselves are issued by individual banks
or financial service companies, which set their own terms and
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   However, the analysts said, recent changes in the industry,
including a dramatic consolidation among card-issuers and the
emergence of so-called smart cards, are reviving the issue of
whether the dominant card networks are choking competition. Smart
cards use a computer chip to expand the ways consumers can make
purchases.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Justice department has felt there was something wrong here
for 25 or 30 years, but haven't been able to figure it out,'' said
Edward E. Furash, chairman the Washington bank consulting firm of
Furash &AMP; Co. ``The new environment makes it easier for them to make
the case (Visa and MasterCard) are exercising duopoly power,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In their press conference, Justice officials traced the lack of
competition between Visa and MasterCard to the fact that both are
run by the same group of big banks. They quoted a top Visa
executive who testified during the Justice Department's
investigation that ``It is very difficult for us to take a step, an
aggressive step that hurts MasterCard because the same banks who
... are in Visa are also in MasterCard.''
</P>
<P>
   The officials charged that the two card networks do not target
advertising against each other or develop competitive products. And
they push banks to offer both cards, an arrangement that is known
in the industry as ``duality'' and one that officials said gives
banks a financial interest in seeing both succeed and therefore in
minimizing competition between them. The officials quoted a top
MasterCard executive saying ``It is clear that because of duality
you don't see MasterCard and Visa in the marketplace attacking each
other.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno charged during her press conference that the advent of
smart cards ``have been delayed for about a decade'' because the
lack of competition between Visa and MasterCard. But analysts said
that officials' ultimate concern is likely that smart cards'
widespread use in the future could allow the two card networks to
secure even greater control of the industry than they now have.
</P>
<P>
   By combining the functions of an ATM card, credit card and
ready-cash cash, the smart cards are expected to cause a
substantial consolidation that could hurt smaller players like
American Express.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice lawsuit grew out of complaint filed by American
Express, which said Wednesday that the legal action is ``a major
step toward breaking the illegal strangehold that Visa and
Mastercard have had on the card industry for years. This lawsuit
will help bring freedom of choice to consumers.''

HOUSE REPUBLICAN LEADERS CAVE IN TO CLINTON ON SPENDING ISSUES 

</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Republican leaders caved in Wednesday to
White House demands that Congress include $18 billion in the
foreign aid bill to help bolster the International Monetary Fund
and strip out provisions that would have prohibited U.S. funds from
being used by overseas groups that promote or perform abortions.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides were close to agreement on the IMF funding
although GOP negotiators still were insisting on tougher IMF
borrowing guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   But the concessions, which angered some conservative GOP members
who were prepared to force a government shutdown rather than
give-in to President Clinton on spending issues, marked a turning
point in the battle between the administration and the Republican
leadership over 1999 appropriations bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``The process of selling out has begun,'' remarked one GOP
leadership aide after House Speaker Newt Gingrich told Republican
lawmakers that he intends to compromise rather than seek
confrontation with the administration.
</P>
<P>
   Another Republican aide said that about 40 GOP conservatives are
upset that a ``disgraced'' president facing impeachment proceedings
still wields enough power to dictate many of the spending
priorities of the Republican-controlled Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got some angry members,'' this aide continued, ``but
we're trying to get out of here so people can get home to
campaign'' before the Nov. 3 elections.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to wrap up the remaining spending bills for the
new fiscal year that began on Oct. 1, Republican and White House
negotiators began meeting Wednesday to work out differences over a
number of controversial issues that if left unresolved could lead
to a government shutdown when a temporary funding measure expires
at midnight Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Although Congress has passed six of the 13 major appropriations
bills needed to run the government, it still has work to do on the
seven remaining bills. Republican leaders said earlier this week
that at least five of the unfinished measures will have to be
rolled into one large catchall bill in order for Congress to wrap
up its legislative business before its scheduled adjournment
deadline of Friday.
</P>
<P>
   However, House Appropriations Chairman Bob Livingston, R-La.,
said that despite the best efforts of Republicans and the White
House to settle their differences, it's likely Congress will remain
in session through at least the weekend and possibly into next
week.
</P>
<P>
   If it fails to meet its Friday deadline, Congress would have to
pass another short-term stopgap measure to keep all government
departments and agencies running until an agreement is reached on
the remaining spending bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know there's a lot of work to get done,'' said White House
budget director Jack Lew after meeting with Livingston and other
Republicans. He added, however, that there was ``a good spirit of
cooperation'' in the meetings that would hopefully avert the kind
of budget stalemate that led to two partial government shutdowns
three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans got most of the blame for those two closings, and
they seem determined to avoid a repeat of it just a month before
the congressional elections on Nov. 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chances of us having a government shutdown are zero,''
said Senate Majority Whip Don Nickles, R-Okla.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to look for how we can find solutions,'' said Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston said that negotiators were ``getting closer to a
final agreement'' on IMF funding. Republicans have given in to
Clinton's demands that at least $18 billion be earmarked to help
replenish IMF loan coffers, which have been drained by the economic
crisis in Asia. But GOP members led by House Majority Leader Dick
Armey, R-Irving, still are insisting that the administration agree
to a number of reform policies that would require the IMF to
implement tougher borrowing guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   By law, Congress is required to have its work on the budget done
by Oct. 1. But this year, the House and Senate had passed only four
of the 13 major spending bills and President Clinton had signed
only one into law by the time the deadline had come and gone.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats used that statistic to charge that the Republican-led
105th Congress had turned in the worst legislative performance in
24 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican Congress has been one of investigation rather
than legislation,'' Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D.,
said.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to put the best face on a bad situation, Republican
leaders also touted what they consider to be their biggest
accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   For example, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill
Archer, R-Texas, called the 105th ``a remarkably successful
Congress'' for passing a balanced budget last year that has
resulted in an estimated $71 billion surplus. He also cited last
year's tax cut, the first in 16 years, as another example of a
Congress focused on trying ``to help the American people help
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   But in praising the Republican performance, Archer also noted
that Clinton ``deserves credit for joining us'' in working out a
budget agreement and tax relief measures that ``enabled the economy
to move ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Although there were plenty of signs that compromise would avert
another government shutdown, White House Chief of Staff Erskine
Bowles planned to insist in a late evening meeting with Gingrich
and Lott that Republicans capitulate to Clinton's demand that more
be found for his education priorities of hiring more teachers,
improving after-school programs and building more schools.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have been willing to give a little in some of those
areas, but have drawn the line so far at giving Clinton all the
money he wants to hire 100,000 new teachers. &QL;

UNDECIDED IN HOUSE FACE DIFFICULT MOMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It's not every day that first-term Representative
James Maloney gets a call from the White House inviting him to have
coffee with the first lady. It's even rarer that he would turn down
the invitation.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday the Democrat from Connecticut said no thanks to
the White House and its wooing to vote against a wide-ranging House
inquiry over whether to impeach the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just told them I'd have to pass on that,'' said Maloney,
adding that he couldn't easily fit the White House session into a
busy morning schedule. ``This is a decision I have to make on my
own, untainted by politics, partisanship, or party.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting on the fence may draw unusual attention, but it isn't a
comfortable spot for a freshman Democrat who wants to be a team
player. But at the same time, he also wants to curry favor with
constituents back home in a New England district that is nominally
Democratic but just as happy to elect Republicans. Maloney has an
aggressive, well-funded challenger and is considered one of the 10
most vulnerable House incumbents on Nov. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday Maloney said he was still undecided about his vote. He
said he was uneasy with the open-ended sweep and scope of the
resolution passed Monday by the House Judiciary Committee's
Republican majority but is unable to see how the far narrower
alternative favored by committee Democrats could produce an
adequate and necessary investigation into the allegations against
the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to have to choose between the lesser of two evils,''
Maloney said, acknowledging he was ``leaning toward'' a vote for
the resolution unless House Democrats could, as the hours ticked
away, craft a new version that looked less like a whitewash and was
more to his liking. By day's end, Maloney had not seen such a
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Like Maloney, Representative Anne Northup was trying to avoid
the limelight. Northup said she will vote for the resolution, but
as a freshman Republican trying to hold onto her
Democratic-majority district in Louisville, she's proceeding
quietly and putting the emphasis on the inquiry, not impeachment,
for the voters back home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the only way to move it forward, fast, and get it over
with,'' Northup said, pointing to Judiciary Committee Chairman
Henry Hyde's prediction that the impeachment investigation could be
done by New Year's. ``So I'm going to vote for it, but I'm not
particularly eager to see this administration fall apart, and I
don't believe a sexual relationship is grounds for impeaching the
president.''
</P>
<P>
   While Congress's focus Wednesday was on the upcoming vote, the
hearts and minds of members like Maloney and Northup were on how it
would play Election Day. There were meetings upon meetings
Wednesday as Democratic leaders tried not so much to find ways to
save face for the president but to figure out how to give cover to
rank-and-file members who face tough reelection fights.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Maloney, a former state senator, upset three-term
Republican Representative Gary Franks in a replay of the 1994
contest that Franks won. The district, which includes the urban
centers of Waterbury, Danbury, and Meriden, is largely middle and
upper class, predominantly white, and a bit more fiscally and
socially conservative than the Democratic Party nationally.
President Clinton won the district in 1996; George Bush carried it
in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Maloney, who graduated from Harvard and got his law degree at
Boston University, is being challenged by Mark Nielsen, a GOP state
senator who got his undergraduate and law degrees from Harvard.
Right now, the race is a dead heat, and Nielsen is pressing hard on
issues such as character and trust.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very competitive district, and Democrats in these
competitive, uncertain situations are nervous,'' said Stuart
Rothenberg, a campaign analyst. ``So they go for safety, which is
covering their behinds from Republican attacks and assaults that
they are somehow affirming the president's behavior if they don't
vote for a full-blown hearing.''
</P>
<P>
   Polls around the country, including recent ones in Connecticut
and Kentucky, show that voters highly approve of the way Clinton is
doing his job and by about a two-to-one margin do not believe he
should be impeached.
</P>
<P>
   A Quinnipiac College poll conducted at the end of September said
35 percent of Connecticut voters would be less likely to vote for a
candidate who wanted to impeach the president (14 percent would be
more likely). A Louisville Courier-Journal poll published Tuesday
gave Clinton his highest job approval ever among Kentucky voters:
63 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many Democrats, particularly those in swing districts,
are worried that the scandal will energize Republican voters and
depress Democratic turnout, giving an edge to GOP challengers.
Nielsen charged that Maloney, his opponent, will pander to
Republicans with a ``politically expedient'' vote for the
impeachment inquiry, no matter what it costs in good will from the
Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim Maloney represents a Republican district, and he is
scrambling in every possible way to masquerade as a Republican on
the eve of the election,'' said Nielsen, who said he would ``not
hesitate'' to vote for the resolution himself.
</P>
<P>
   In Louisville, former state attorney general Chris Gorman is
running a spirited race against Northup, who was the only
Republican in 1996 to win a House seat in a district that Clinton
carried. Though Northup is well-funded and a rising GOP star,
Gorman said he believes she will be punished by voters at home who
are sick of the partisan witch hunt in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``How she votes on launching an inquiry will obviously be an
issue in the campaign,'' said Gorman, who calls the president's
behavior ``wrong'' but not an impeachable offense. ``I do think
there will be a backlash because Americans believe in fair play and
what they see is Republicans overplaying their hands and going over
the top.''
</P>
<P>
   Northup, a mother of six and former state legislator who
political analyst Charles Cook calls ``one savvy politician,'' said
she doesn't expect ``huge consequences'' from her vote today. She
suggested, however, that ``we will change our strategy really
fast'' and run a negative campaign against Gorman if he exploits
her inquiry vote.
</P>
<P>
   Maloney, who is critical of the Clinton sex scandal, said he has
``no idea'' how important the issue will be in his campaign. He
said most candidates ``run to their partisan barricks and proceed
to throw bricks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The voters want me to do the right things for the right
reasons,'' Maloney said. ``In the end, it's going to be up to them
to evaluate how well I've done.''

CONGRESSIONAL REPUBLICANS AGREE ON BANKRUPTCY REFORM 
</HEADLINE>
   (nk)  
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House and Senate Republicans agreed Wednesday on a
massive overhaul of the bankruptcy system, making it more difficult
for consumers to walk away from their debts and handing the banking
and credit-card industries a major victory.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement was reached without the consent of congressional
Democrats or the White House, and administration officials said
they would recommend that President Clinton veto the bill because
of its treatment of low-income consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Republican agreement, consumers would have to meet an
income test before they could declare bankruptcy. But the agreement
would also give bankruptcy judges some discretion in determining
whether debtors could file under Chapter 7, which wipes out many
debts, or under Chapter 13, which requires the repayment of most
debts.
</P>
<P>
   Debtors who earn more than the median income _ $17,900 for
single people and $51,000 for a family of four _ would be moved
into Chapter 13. Also sent into Chapter 13 would be debtors who
could repay 25 percent of their unsecured debts, such as credit
cards, or $5,000 over five years.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiated bill waters down a Senate-passed requirement that
credit card companies disclose on each monthly bill how much
consumers will owe and for how long if they make only the minimum
payment.
</P>
<P>
   It also drops the Senate-passed homestead limit of $100,000.
This means that people could still move to certain states, like
Florida and Texas, buy expensive homes, declare bankruptcy and keep
the entire worth of their homes. However, the compromise bill
requires these people to live in the adopted state for at least two
years before they can claim the homestead exemption.
</P>
<P>
   With the perception that low-income Americans _ primarily women
and minorities, who are among Clinton's most reliable political
allies _ would be hurt most by the bill, Hillary Rodham Clinton has
argued against the House version, toward which the compromise
tilts.
</P>
<P>
   Both the House and Senate had earlier approved vastly different
bills, and negotiators have been scrambling to iron out the
differences before Congress recesses this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said Wednesday that they were happy with the
compromise and that it was fair, but Democrats were furious, none
more so than Sen. Richard Durbin of Illinois. He had joined
Republicans in seeking an overhaul of the bankruptcy system, and
his name gave the process bipartisan credibility. But he said he
was shut out of the final negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill, which had passed by a vote of 97-1, ``has been
devastated in a closed-door Republican conference,'' Durbin said.
``Republican conferees stripped out every significant consumer
protection in the Senate bill,'' he added. ``The president will not
sign this bill in its present form.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's agreement represents a huge success for banks,
credit-card companies and retailers. The lending industry spent
more than $40 million to lobby for the changes, which could help it
recoup an estimated $4 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   Bankruptcy filings reached a record 1.42 million over the 12
months ending on June 30, continuing a troubling three-year trend
that has persisted despite the robust economy. More than 1 million
of these bankruptcies were filed under Chapter 7, which erases all
debt except taxes, mortgages, student loans, child support, alimony
and, in some cases, loans on a car needed to get to work.
</P>
<P>
   The industry supported the House-passed bill, which was guided
by a concern that filing for bankruptcy had become too easy and
that thousands of Americans were abusing the system. The Senate
bill started from the premise that easily available credit is also
responsible for the rise in bankruptcies and that the credit-card
industry needed to be held accountable along with consumers.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, who led the negotiations for the
Senate, said that the compromise protected honest consumers from
those who abused the bankruptcy rules. ``Consumers across the
country who work hard and pay their own way should not be forced to
subsidize the abusive spending practices of those who exploit the
federal bankruptcy code for personal gain or convenience,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   William Binzel, a lobbyist for MasterCard International, said
that complaints of a bill that let the industry off the hook were
unfounded. ``If a lender makes credit available to someone who
can't afford to repay it, the lender loses the principle and
interest,'' he said. ``The bill addresses the fundamental flaw in
the law that allows a debtor who can repay a portion of his debts
to use the system to walk away from those debts.''

OATHS WITH MORE BITE MIGHT BRING OUT MORE TRUTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE WILSON  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - When people testify under oath, they swear to tell the
truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. Then they lie.
</P>
<P>
   Judges will tell you the oath doesn't prevent most criminal
defendants from lying in their testimony. According to Ken Starr,
it didn't stop Bill Clinton, either.
</P>
<P>
   His possible impeachment hinges on the question of whether he
testified honestly. More than half of the 15 potential grounds for
impeachment involve charges that he didn't tell the truth. Speaking
to the House Judiciary Committee Monday, majority counsel David
Schippers said the ``sanctity of the oath'' was of paramount
importance. He asserted:
</P>
<P>
   ``If lying under oath is tolerated, and when exposed is not
visited with immediate and substantial adverse consequences, the
integrity of this country's entire judicial process is fatally
compromised.''
</P>
<P>
   Why are so many people willing to risk perjury and swear falsely
to God?
</P>
<P>
   Ethical laxity, rationalizing, little fear of divine or legal
retribution, and immediate self-interest all figure in. Defendants
would rather risk a future penalty from God than spend the next
several years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   One other reason may be the oath itself.
</P>
<P>
   In many courts, it's a less than solemn matter, hastily
administered by clerks who seem bored by the task. The words come
across with a wooden formality and fail to stir the conscience.
</P>
<P>
   Some believe oaths would make a larger impression if judges gave
them or if wording was added to remind defendants that dishonest
testimony can lead to prosecution for perjury. Others would have
the oath signed in court as well as verbally sworn to give it more
impact.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, oaths packed a bigger punch. The potential for
divine punishment was declared emphatically. A 17th-century English
judge sought to encourage truthfulness this way:
</P>
<P>
   ``Now mark what I say to you, friend. Thou has a precious,
immortal soul, and there is nothing in the world equal to it in
value. Consider that the great God of Heaven and Earth, before
whose wise tribunal thou and we are to stand at the last day, will
call thee to account for the rescinding of truth and take vengeance
of thee for every falsehood thou tellest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I charge thee, therefore, that thou do not dare to waver one
tittle from the truth . . . for that the God of Heaven may justly
strike thee into eternal flames and make thee drop into the
bottomless lake of fire and brimstone.''
</P>
<P>
   Another approach to oath-taking was to have defendants swear to
suffer specific consequences if they lied. In an Irish court early
in this century, when lawyers were allowed to present oaths to
defendants, a man was on trial for not paying a debt. The
plaintiff's lawyer asked the accused to repeat after him:
</P>
<P>
   ``If I do not tell the truth in this case . . .''
</P>
<P>
   The defendant repeated the words.
</P>
<P>
   ``May a murrain (an infectious disease) seize my cattle.''
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital) ``What's that, counselor? Sure that's not the oath
. . . Oh, glory be to God, may a murrain seize my cattle.'' (end
ital)
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer continued: ``May all my sheep be cliffted (fall over
a cliff).''
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital) ``What oath is that you're trying to get me to
take? I never heard an oath like that.'' (end ital)
</P>
<P>
   ``Go on, sir.''
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital) ``Oh, God help us all! May all my sheep _ arrah,
counselor, are you sure that's in the oath?'' (end ital)
</P>
<P>
   ``Go on, sir.''
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital) ``Oh! God! May all my sheep be cliffted.'' (end
ital)
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer pressed on: ``May all my children get the falling
sickness.''
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital) ``Arrah, counselor, tell His Honor that I admit the
debt, and I only want a little time to pay.'' (end ital)
</P>
<P>
   Now that was an oath with teeth in it. Perhaps Clinton would
have been less equivocating if he had sworn to one that threatened
unbearable consequences, one that went something like this:
</P>
<P>
   If I do not tell the whole truth in this case, may I spend
eternity as the most junior lackey to Newt Gingrich and the most
devoted husband of Linda Tripp.
</P>
<P>
   You can bet the president would have been a veritable fountain
of veracity. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Sen. Alfonse D'Amato and Rep. Charles Schumer are locked in an
extraordinarily tight race for the U.S. Senate. The outcome
apparently rests with a small group of undecided voters, many of
whom are not yet paying attention to the contest, a statewide New
York Times/CBS News Poll has found.
</P>
<P>
   With a month to go until the election, the poll found a large
number of respondents _ 60 percent _ either had no opinion about
Schumer, or did not know enough about him to offer an opinion. At
the same time, a sizable number of voters continue to voice
reservations about D'Amato's ethics and ideology, including many
undecided voters and some respondents who identified themselves as
the senator's supporters.
</P>
<P>
   The findings suggest two dynamics that will shape the New York
contest in its final weeks: a struggle by both camps to define
Schumer's public personality among voters who do not know him, and
an attempt by Schumer to exploit the obvious and strong liabilities
D'Amato carries as a three-term Republican senator in New York.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, this closely watched contest is shaping up as a
replay of the 1992 Senate race, when D'Amato ran against Robert
Abrams, the former state attorney general. A Times poll in the
third week of October 1992 found D'Amato in an effective tie with
his Democratic challenger. D'Amato ultimately defeated Abrams by a
single percentage point after a searing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But this latest Times/CBS News poll points to a number of ways
in which this contest is different from 1992, and that is not
necessarily good news for D'Amato. An equal number of voters now
view D'Amato and Schumer as being serious when it comes to dealing
with crime, evidence that the nine-term Brooklyn congressman has
achieved some success in neutralizing a traditionally Republican
issue.
</P>
<P>
   While D'Amato continues to be widely viewed as ``the kind of
person who gets things done for the voters'' _ clearly one of his
biggest political advantages going into the last couple of months _
a substantial number of respondents said he was lacking in honesty
and integrity, and that he did not care ``about the needs and
problems of people like you.'' Schumer scored strongly on both
measures.
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps most strikingly, D'Amato's intense effort to derail
Schumer's campaign with a series of attacks these past three weeks
_ from portraying him as a liberal to spotlighting votes he has
missed in Washington as he campaigned in New York this year _ has
yet to show obvious effect on the public's view of the congressman.
Only 18 percent of respondents had an unfavorable rating of
Schumer, compared to 22 percent who had a favorable rating. By
contrast, in a poll conducted in the third week of October of 1992,
Abrams was viewed unfavorably by one in three voters.
</P>
<P>
   In the current poll, D'Amato is viewed favorably by 27 percent
and unfavorably by 36 percent, virtually the same marks he received
six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   By almost every measure that pollsters use to try to analyze an
election _ registered voters, likely voters, and taking into
account how undecided New Yorkers might be leaning toward _ this
contest is a dead heat.
</P>
<P>
   Among registered voters, Schumer is supported by 44 percent,
compared to 41 percent for D'Amato. There were 12 percent
undecided. Among those respondents considered most likely to vote,
based on their past behavior and current level of interest in the
contest, the margin is 47 percent for Schumer to 43 percent for
D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   The Times/CBS News statewide telephone poll was conducted from
last Thursday through Tuesday with 1,461 adults, of whom 1,066 said
they were registered to vote. It has a margin of sampling error of
plus or minus three points. Therefore, among registered voters,
Schumer could be ahead by as much as nine points _ or D'Amato could
be ahead by three points.

GREENSPAN SAYS OUTLOOK FOR U.S. ECONOMY HAS `WEAKENED MEASUREABLY,'
BUT IN REASONABLE SHAPE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DAVID IVANOVICH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The U.S. economy remains in ``reasonable shape''
despite financial turmoil overseas, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan said Wednesday, but he warned the global crisis could
dampen domestic demand ``to an unknown extent.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan told a group of economists gathered here for a meeting
of the National Association of Business Economics the outlook for
the U.S. economy in 1999 has ``weakened measurably'' since Russia
devalued its currency and defaulted on some of its foreign debt
less than eight weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is occurring is a broad area of uncertainty or fear,''
Greenspan said. ``And when human beings are confronted with
uncertainty ... they disengage.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors' heightened fear of risk may have prompted many
Wednesday to dump stocks on the technology-laden and
growth-oriented Nasdaq composite in favor of the better-known names
on the Dow Jones industrial average, economists said.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq lost 3.2 percent of its value, falling 48.28 points
to hit 1462.61, its lowest level in more than 15 months, while the
Dow dipped a mere 1.29 points to close at 7741.69.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a flight to some big names here,'' said Paul Kasriel,
chief U.S. economist for Northern Trust in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Just how dramatic an effect this change in investor attitudes
toward risk will have on the U.S. economy remains an open question.
The nation's economy is still ``quite an impressive sight,''
Greenspan said, enjoying ``good growth and low if not declining
inflation. But the situation ``has become very fluid.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not know how far it will go or how much it will affect
consumer and business spending here at home,'' Greenspan said.
``This is a time for monetary policy to be especially alert.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Fed-watchers interpreted that comment to suggest Greenspan,
as the nation's central banker, may act unilaterally to lower
interest rates in an effort to protect the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Open Market Committee voted last week to reduce the
federal funds rate _ the benchmark rate commercial banks charge one
another for overnight loans _ by a quarter of a percentage point.
</P>
<P>
   The committee is slated to meet again Nov. 17, but Greenspan has
the authority to lower rates on his own, said Sung Won Sohn, chief
economist for Minneapolis-based Norwest Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to set a more upbeat tone, David Wilcox, assistant U.S.
Treasury secretary for economic policy, reminded the economists the
United States is still in the eighth year of an economic expansion
and that ``the fundamentals of the U.S. economy remain strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment has remained below 5 percent for 15 months, the
longest stretch in 28 years, Wilcox said. Real wages have risen 2.8
percent over the last year _ the biggest increase since the early
1970s _ while inflation has remained almost non-existent.
</P>
<P>
   While the turmoil overseas is believed to be slowing economic
activity here in the United States, ``such a tempering in growth
does not, on its face, pose a major threat to the longevity of the
current expansion and has, in fact, been expected for some time
now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although the precise impact of the global financial crisis on
the U.S. economy is at this point uncertain, the latest evidence
available to us makes a strong case that the current expansion will
continue,'' Wilcox said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the International Monetary Fund, the Washington-based
financial rescue fund, estimated economic growth in the United
States would reach 3.5 percent this year but drop to about 2
percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, the world's second-largest economy, IMF economists are
expecting economic activity to fall 2.5 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Japan's economic woes, the yen _ for months _ has
languished against the U.S. dollar. Suddenly, the dollar dropped
against the yen Wednesday, falling a dizzying 9.50 yen.
</P>
<P>
   Part of that movement, economists said, may have been caused by
encouraging news out of Japan that suggested the government there
may finally be ready to reform its troubled banking system.
</P>
<P>
   But some economists suggested the move may have had more to do
with rumors that two U.S. ``hedge funds'' _ investment funds which
service rich investors and use a wide range of high-risk techniques
in an effort to attract stellar returns _ were altering their
investment strategy.
</P>
<P>
   These funds, many believe, had borrowed heavily from Japanese
lenders at very low interest rates and then used this cash to
purchase U.S. securities. To pay off their Japanese lenders, these
hedge funds then, many believe, had been using U.S. dollars to buy
Japanese yen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, I think the hedge funds unwinding their positions had
a lot more to do with the market (Wednesday) than what the Japanese
may or may not do,'' Sohn said. ``Who knows with the Japanese.
They'll probably let us down again. Frankly, I don't have high
hopes.'' &QL;

   PHOENIX - Phoenix had a chance to act like the big city it's
supposed to be and botched it. (begin ital) You (end ital) botched
it. You proved, once again, that this wildly expanding desert
megalopolis is a ``city'' in name only.
</P>
<P>
   I'm talking about the disappearance and sudden reappearance of
21-year-old Mary Jo Ruiz.
</P>
<P>
   For more than two weeks you couldn't turn on the TV or open the
newspaper or listen the radio without bumping into a story of the
young woman from south Phoenix who'd mysteriously vanished.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz had been dancing with friends at Moon Doggie's dance club
in the Arizona Center in downtown Phoenix on the night of Sept. 3.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, she borrowed the keys to her best friend's 1997
Dodge Neon, parked in a nearby garage.
</P>
<P>
   She went to the car alone, and didn't return.
</P>
<P>
   Before you know it, television crews were camped out outside the
family's home near Southern and 19th avenues.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz's mother, sisters and other relatives were featured on
newscast after newscast tearfully asking for your help, your
prayers, your money.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the sophisticated city dwellers you're supposed to be,
you gave it.
</P>
<P>
   This probably wouldn't have happened in New York, Los Angeles,
Chicago, Houston or Philadelphia, the five American cities with
more people than us.
</P>
<P>
   In those places, a stranger is a stranger, period.
</P>
<P>
   Here, a woman you don't know disappears and you act as if she's
your daughter or your sister.
</P>
<P>
   Prayer vigils were held. Fliers were circulated.
</P>
<P>
   Car washes were organized to collect reward money for anyone who
could provide information concerning Mary Jo's whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
   Then, 16 days after disappearing, Ruiz was stopped by Los
Angeles police on Riverside Drive. She was alone in her friend's
car. She said she'd been abducted by three men and raped. She told
officers she'd been released in California _ with the car _ and
wandered around L.A. for days because she was ashamed about what
happened to her.
</P>
<P>
   Her story confused investigators. When they asked to
re-interview Ruiz, however, she refused to cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   Police say she hasn't even provided them with enough information
for a composite sketch of suspects.
</P>
<P>
   A few days ago, one of her sisters said she wishes ``everybody
would just mind their own business. . .She's safe at home, that's
all that matters.''
</P>
<P>
   But, it isn't. The ``reward`` money matters.
</P>
<P>
   After Mary Jo was found, one relative said, ``We're going to use
it (the cash) for her counseling.''
</P>
<P>
   That isn't why it was collected. It was supposed to be a reward,
not a cash-back bonus.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of charities that could put the money to good
use, including those that search for missing persons.
</P>
<P>
   As for ``minding their own business,'' that's exactly what the
Ruiz family asked you (begin ital) not (end ital) to do.
</P>
<P>
   And you went along.
</P>
<P>
   A real big city would never do that. A real big city wouldn't
give a damn.
</P>
<P>
   But, here you are. This place has the skyscrapers of a city. The
restaurants and ball teams of a city. The concert halls, museums
and hospitals of a city.
</P>
<P>
   It just doesn't have the attitude.
</P>
<P>
   The next stranger who turns up missing will get the same
treatment. It's already happened. A mother disappeared recently and
you rushed to support her family, and continue to do so even after
the woman's children were accused of killing her.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of behavior isn't what makes Phoenix the sixth largest
city in America. It's what makes Phoenix the biggest small town in
America.
</P>
<P>
   You have this tendency to want to help people, to give them the
benefit of the doubt. Maybe you're a little too friendly and a
little too naive.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, if we're lucky, you'll stay that way. &QL;

SOME `BLUE DOG DEMOCRATS' ARE LIKELY TO SUPPORT GOP INQUIRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Republicans are counting on some ``Blue Dog
Democrats'' to support the GOP impeachment resolution Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Dogs are conservatives from swing districts in the
South, the Midwest and the West. Some face tough re-election
battles Nov. 3 while others, though unopposed or up against token
opposition, worry that any impeachment-related vote favoring
President Clinton might come back to haunt them.
</P>
<P>
   With a 228-206 GOP majority, it's a foregone conclusion that the
House will approve the Republican-sponsored inquiry into Clinton's
conduct in the White House sex scandal and its aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   But the more Democratic votes the GOP gains, the easier it is
for Republicans to cast the impeachment inquiry in a bipartisan
light. The fewer the Democratic votes, the easier it is for Clinton
and party loyalists on Capitol Hill to cast it as a partisan witch
hunt.
</P>
<P>
   Among Democrats either committed or likely to vote for the
Republican resolution are Rep. Charles Stenholm of Texas, Rep. Jim
Turner of Texas, Rep. Gene Taylor of Mississippi, Rep. Chris John
of Louisiana, Rep. Tim Roemer of Indiana, Rep. Jim Moran of
Virginia, Rep. Paul McHale of Pennsylvania, Rep. Virgil Goode of
Virginia, Rep. William Lipinski of Illinois and Rep. Owen Pickett
of Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Of those, Stenholm, Turner, Taylor, John, Goode, Lipinski and
Pickett are members of the Blue Dog Coalition, formed in 1995 as a
vehicle for conservative Democrats who favored a balanced budget.
With 24 members, the coalition's name is a variation on the
traditional Southern ``yellow dog'' Democrat, a party loyalist who
would even vote for a yellow dog if it were running as a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   The group cast itself as Blue Dogs because they claimed that
liberals in the party had ``choked off'' their conservative
viewpoint.
</P>
<P>
   Stenholm and Turner both face staunch Republican opposition in
the Nov. 3 election.
</P>
<P>
   Another Blue Dog, Rep. Gary Condit, D-Calif., said he too was
``leaning toward support'' of the Republican measure, but wanted to
see what, if any, conditions the Republicans attached to it. ``I
think several members in our group are going to support it.''
</P>
<P>
   For Democrats in tight races, said Democratic consultant Celinda
Lake, ``the question is how to get back to the business of the
country. Some Democrats will say the best way to do that is vote
for the inquiry.''
</P>
<P>
   Estimates of Democratic defections varied Wednesday as members
pondered an alternate Democratic resolution that would set a
deadline for the inquiry and limit the inquiry to Clinton's affair
with Monica Lewinsky. A similar Democratic alternative went down to
defeat Monday on a party-line vote in the Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Several wavering Democrats said they would vote for the
Democratic alternative, but did not foreclose voting for the GOP
resolution when, as expected, the Democratic version is defeated.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ellen Tauscher, D-Calif., a member of the Blue Dogs, said
that while she intended to vote for the Democratic measure, she
would keep her options open when it fails. ``I'm not going to be
painted into a corner'' by Republicans who she felt would
characterize her vote as being against an impeachment inquiry, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Tauscher said Republicans have been ``enormously unfair in their
inability to come to any kind of consensus'' with Democrats. But
ultimately, she added, ``we have to do the right thing by the
Constitution to make sure we are being thoughtful and sober about
deliberations.''
</P>
<P>
   A second possible source of Democratic support for the
Republican resolution is the New Democratic Coalition, formed in
1996 to rally moderate Democrats mostly in suburban swing
districts.
</P>
<P>
   Less conservative than the Blue Dogs, the New Democrat Coalition
is built around support for many of the policies championed by
Clinton: Welfare reform, free trade and encouraging high
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Roemer and Moran are leaders of the 40-member coalition. ``We
know we're going to go forward with an inquiry,'' Moran said
Wednesday, adding that for the 20-to-30 Democrats in tight
re-election bids, the best strategy is to neutralize the issue by
voting for the Republican version.
</P>
<P>
   New Democrats are ``trying to balance the policies with the
politics,'' said Rep. Calvin Dooley, D-Calif., a member of the
coalition, who said he too intended to vote for the Democratic
measure, but would not rule out voting for the Republican version.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither myself nor any member of Congress wants to stand in
the way of a responsible process that can bring this sad chapter in
our country to closure.''

ISRAELIS AND PALESTINIANS MOVE CLOSER TO NEW ACCORD 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   EREZ, Gaza _ Signaling an unexpected thaw in a long frosty
relationship, Benjamin Netanyahu and Yasser Arafat broke bread
together for the first time on Wednesday, after Netanyahu became
the first Israeli prime minister to cross over to the Palestinian
side of the Erez checkpoint for a meeting.
</P>
<P>
   It was an impromptu conclusion to Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright's two-day Middle East trip, a last-minute lunch that
included unprecedented banter and gift-giving between the Likud
Party leader in his business suit and the Palestinian chairman in
his headdress and fatigues.
</P>
<P>
   Albright, with evident relief, said it indicated a breakthrough
in a mistrustful relationship between Netanyahu and Arafat, which
would make it far easier to finalize an interim peace accord at a
Washington summit meeting to be presided over by President Clinton.
She announced that the meeting would start on Oct. 15, and the
White House said it would take place at the Wye Plantation, a
conference center in rural Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as my goals for this trip are concerned, I am more than
satisfied, in fact I am very pleasantly surprised,'' Albright said.
``I don't want to do psychobabble, but there really was a sense
that these two men felt there was a stake in moving forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright and aides described a progressive easing of the
standoff between the Israeli and Palestinian leaders over the last
two weeks in meetings in New York, Washington and here. During
these meetings, their first face-to-face sessions in over a year,
it became clear that, at the least, a minimally cordial
relationship was a necessary prelude to breaking an 18-month
stalemate.
</P>
<P>
   In a minor breakthrough on Wednesday, the Israelis and
Palestinians came to an understanding on three specific parts of
the interim peace agreement, in which Israel is to withdraw from
another 13 percent of the West Bank in exchange for a Palestinian
crackdown on terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   After three years of stalling, they agreed to open a Gaza
industrial park near Erez in December. They agreed to a set up and
abide by an ``anti-incitement committee,'' which would hear each
side's complaints that the other was fomenting hostility. And they
agreed to establish ``people-to-people'' programs to foster
relationships between Israelis and Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said they also ``made significant and substantial
progress'' on the key issues _ the Israeli redeployment of forces
and an institutionalized, cooperative mechanism for maintaining
security in the region. George Tenant, the director of central
intelligence, had flown in from Washington to help hammer out the
security agreement, which was not completed.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Netanyahu gave a more modest appraisal of the two days'
accomplishments, saying that they had ``climbed the foothills'' but
that there remained a ``mountain to scale in Washington.'' Still,
he made it clear that he considered an agreement to be on the
horizon by saying that if an accord were reached in Washington, he
might open talks on the final status of Palestinian-Israeli peace
``on the spot.''
</P>
<P>
   The first step toward a new, improved relationship between the
Israeli and Palestinian leaders began last Sunday in a suite at the
Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York. When the men entered that
meeting, they held themselves stiffly, looked ill at ease and
talked indirectly, through negotiators and Albright.
</P>
<P>
   After a series of subsequent sessions, their ``body language''
softened, Albright said. They began talking directly to each other,
smiling and chatting. On Wednesday, Arafat even gave Netanyahu, a
cigar aficionado, a present: a box of Cuban cigars.
</P>
<P>
   After Netanyahu and Albright traveled south from Jerusalem by
helicopter, the three-way meeting began Wednesday morning on the
Israeli side of the Erez checkpoint. It was a meeting place rife
with the tensions on the negotiating table, since Palestinians in
Gaza have been locked inside the strip by Israeli border closures
for three weeks. Some 25,000 workers have been unable to report to
their jobs in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   After more than two hours of discussions, Netanyahu suggested
ordering sandwiches, and Arafat responded by inviting him to lunch
at his guest house just over the border in Palestinian-controlled
Gaza. Sitting around a T-shaped banquet table loaded with platters,
Arafat, Netanyahu, Albright and a dozen aides dined on shrimp,
lamb, hummus and a local fish, denise, which they kiddingly called
Dennis in reference to Dennis Ross, the U.S. peace envoy to the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Albright led a toast to diplomacy, and the three leaders joined
hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can confirm to you that the food and the cigars were all
kosher,'' Netanyahu later told Israeli reporters, who had not
asked.
</P>
<P>
   After the lunch Albright couched her optimism with some cautious
words. ``I wasn't born yesterday and there still are very many hard
problems out there.'' She described the bottom line of the
negotiations as: ``Nothing is agreed to until everything is agreed
to.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Among the things agreed to on Wednesday was the opening of the
Gaza industrial park, which now has 17 investors and could provide
40,000 jobs once developed, according to negotiators. The Israelis
have agreed to set up a sophisticated scanner that could perform
quick security checks on commercial containers so that products can
move quickly over the border.
</P>
<P>
   A senior State Department official said an agreement is expected
within days, too, on an opening date for the Gaza airport, which
has sat idle since it was completed.
</P>
<P>
   Before flying to Egypt on Wednesday evening to brief President
Hosni Mubarak, Arafat said Albright had ``done a lot to push the
peace process forward.'' But one of his Cabinet ministers and a top
negotiator, Dr. Nabil Sha'ath, said Tuesday night that the progress
was not great enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have nothing but to give Netanyahu one more chance, but it
might be the last chance,'' he said, referring to the Oct. 15
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   In an act offensive to the Palestinians, Netanyahu traveled on
Tuesday night to the Jewish settlement of Ariel in the West Bank to
celebrate its new status as a city, proclaiming it ``a fact, a part
of Israel in any final status.'' A senior State Department official
called this the kind of provocation that could sour a deal.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, though, Netanyahu was not only defending his
intention to hand over more of the West Bank, which right-wing
members of his political coalition have called grounds to bring
down his government, but insisting that he should stay in office to
finish the final status talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing we've proven,'' Netanyahu said. ``We can stand up to
every criticism, every pressure. If they think someone else could
lead the negotiations to final-status agreements, if they think the
left should do it, well ...''
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving Israel for Brussels, Belgium, Albright said that
she felt President Clinton could help push the leaders toward a
comprehensive agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a very special ability to work with people who have
different problems and also to put himself in their shoes,'' she
said.

SOME `BLUE DOG DEMOCRATS' ARE LIKELY TO SUPPORT GOP INQUIRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Republicans are counting on the ``Blue Dog
Democrats'' for support for the GOP impeachment resolution
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Dogs are conservatives from swing districts in the
South, the Midwest and the West. Some face tough re-election
battles Nov. 3 while others, though unopposed or up against token
opposition, worry that any impeachment-related vote favoring
President Clinton might come back to haunt them.
</P>
<P>
   With a 228-206 GOP majority, it's a foregone conclusion that the
House will approve the Republican-sponsored inquiry into Clinton's
conduct in the White House sex scandal and its aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   But the more Democratic votes the GOP gains, the easier it is
for Republicans to cast the impeachment inquiry in a bipartisan
light. The fewer the Democratic votes, the easier it is for Clinton
and party loyalists on Capitol Hill to cast it as a partisan witch
hunt.
</P>
<P>
   Among Democrats either committed to voting for the Republican
resolution or most likely to are Rep. Charles Stenholm of Texas,
Rep. Jim Turner, of Texas, Rep. Gene Taylor, of Mississippi, Rep.
Chris John, of Louisiana, Rep. Tim Roemer, of Indiana, Rep. Jim
Moran, of Virginia, Rep. Paul McHale, of Pennsylvania, Rep. Virgil
Goode, D-Va., Rep. William Lipinski, D-Ill., and Rep. Owen Pickett,
D-Va.
</P>
<P>
   IS THE FOLLOWING TRANSITION STILL CORRECT: `OF THOSE,....' ?
</P>
<P>
   Of those, Stenholm, Turner, Taylor and John are members of the
Blue Dog Coalition, formed in 1995 as a vehicle for conservative
Democrats who favored a balanced budget. With 24 members, the
coalition's name is a variation on the traditional Southern
``yellow dog'' Democrat, a party loyalist who would even vote for a
yellow dog if it were running as a Democrat.

 U.S. BRINGS SUIT AGAINST VISA AND MASTERCARD 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The U.S. government filed an antitrust lawsuit
against Visa USA and Mastercard International on Wednesday,
claiming that the nation's two biggest credit-card networks
restrain competition and limit consumers' choices.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, filed by the Justice Department in Manhattan
federal court, challenges the control of both credit-card
associations by the same set of banks, as well as the rules adopted
by Visa and Mastercard that ban member banks from offering credit
cards of competitors like American Express and Discover.
</P>
<P>
   ``These exclusionary rules deny consumers the ability to choose
among a maximum variety of card products, Attorney General Janet
Reno said in a statement. ``America's consumers have lost out.''
</P>
<P>
   Executives from both Visa and Mastercard were quick to respond,
saying they would fight the suit and insisting that their industry
is among the most competitive in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fundamentally, this is a solution in search of a problem,''
said Paul Allen, executive vice president and general counsel for
Visa USA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers know that if they want a payment card, they can get
it very easily and have unlimited choice,'' he added. ``Competition
in the marketplace is the litmus test of antitrust laws. And it
doesn't seem to me that consumer choice has been diminished.''
</P>
<P>
   Competitors were elated at the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am thrilled,'' said Philip Purcell, chairman and chief
executive of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, the financial-services
company that owns the Discover card. ``The Justice Department has
studied competition in the industry very intensely, and it took a
lot of tenacity and courage to come out with the lawsuit.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit followed a two-year investigation of the credit-card
industry following complaints by American Express Co. In a
statement on Wednesday, American Express called the lawsuit ``a
major step toward breaking the illegal stranglehold that Visa and
Mastercard have had on the card industry for years.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit also got a positive response on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mastercard and Visa's practices are blatantly
anti-competitive,'' Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., said in a
statement. ``I strongly support the Department of Justice in this
action.''
</P>
<P>
   As of midyear, Visa and Mastercard accounted for 75 percent of
credit-card sales, according to the Nilson Report, a credit-card
industry newsletter published in Oxnard, Calif. American Express
accounted for 18 percent of sales and Discover 6 percent. Diners
Club purchases were 1 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
   But David Robertson, president of the Nilson Report, said those
figures are misleading. And he said he saw little benefit to
consumers if the Justice Department wins the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The competition is not between Visa and Mastercard,'' he said.
``The competition is between the banks that issue the cards.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``This lawsuit is supposed to be pro-consumer,'' he added. ``For
the life of me I can't figure out how it is pro-consumer, because
this is a fabulous time for cardholders right now. Competition has
gotten so intense that there are no fees for Visa and Mastercards.
In addition, consumers are being offered cards with very high lines
of credit.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some argued that if the Justice Department prevailed,
the net effect on consumers might be negative, particularly if
banks are successful in issuing high numbers of American Express
cards. Since it charges higher discount rates than either
Mastercard or Visa, the number of merchants who accept American
Express cards has declined in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the extent that more volume is done at the higher discount
rates charged by American Express, I would say this has the
potential to become anti-consumer,'' said Moshe Orenbuch, an
analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &AMP; Co. ``Ultimately, merchants will
charge more to consumers for goods and services.''
</P>
<P>
   Anita Boomstein, a partner specializing in financial services at
the law firm of Hughes, Hubbard &AMP; Reed, said the government might
have a difficult time proving its case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't necessarily agree with Justice's conclusions,'' she
said. ``I am not sure Justice will be able to conclusively prove
that the current structure has stifled competition.''

TIMES POLL SHOWS SCHUMER, D'AMATO IN TIGHT RACE FOR SENATE

(JT) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY with MARJORIE CONNELLY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sen. Alfonse D'Amato and Rep. Charles Schumer are locked in an
extraordinarily tight race for the U.S. Senate. The outcome
apparently rests with a small group of undecided voters, many of
whom are not yet paying attention to the contest, a statewide New
York Times/CBS News Poll has found.
</P>
<P>
   With a month to go until the election, the poll found a large
number of respondents _ 60 percent _ either had no opinion about
Schumer, or did not know enough about him to offer an opinion. At
the same time, a sizable number of voters continue to voice
reservations about D'Amato's ethics and ideology, including many
undecided voters and some respondents who identified themselves as
the senator's supporters.
</P>
<P>
   The findings suggest two dynamics that will shape the New York
contest in its final weeks: a struggle by both camps to define
Schumer's public personality among voters who do not know him, and
an attempt by Schumer to exploit the obvious and strong liabilities
D'Amato carries as a three-term Republican senator in New York.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, this closely watched contest is shaping up as a
replay of the 1992 Senate race, when D'Amato ran against Robert
Abrams, the former state attorney general. A Times poll in the
third week of October 1992 found D'Amato in an effective tie with
his Democratic challenger. D'Amato ultimately defeated Abrams by a
single percentage point after a searing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But this latest Times/CBS News poll points to a number of ways
in which this contest is different from 1992, and that is not
necessarily good news for D'Amato. An equal number of voters now
view D'Amato and Schumer as being serious when it comes to dealing
with crime, evidence that the nine-term Brooklyn congressman has
achieved some success in neutralizing a traditionally Republican
issue.
</P>
<P>
   While D'Amato continues to be widely viewed as ``the kind of
person who gets things done for the voters'' _ clearly one of his
biggest political advantages going into the last couple of months _
a substantial number of respondents said he was lacking in honesty
and integrity, and that he did not care ``about the needs and
problems of people like you.'' Schumer scored strongly on both
measures.
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps most strikingly, D'Amato's intense effort to derail
Schumer's campaign with a series of attacks these past three weeks
_ from portraying him as a liberal to spotlighting votes he has
missed in Washington as he campaigned in New York this year _ has
yet to show obvious effect on the public's view of the congressman.
Only 18 percent of respondents had an unfavorable rating of
Schumer, compared to 22 percent who had a favorable rating. By
contrast, in a poll conducted in the third week of October of 1992,
Abrams was viewed unfavorably by one in three voters.
</P>
<P>
   In the current poll, D'Amato is viewed favorably by 27 percent
and unfavorably by 36 percent, virtually the same marks he received
six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   By almost every measure that pollsters use to try to analyze an
election _ registered voters, likely voters, and taking into
account how undecided New Yorkers might be leaning toward _ this
contest is a dead heat.
</P>
<P>
   Among registered voters, Schumer is supported by 44 percent,
compared to 41 percent for D'Amato. There were 12 percent
undecided. Among those respondents considered most likely to vote,
based on their past behavior and current level of interest in the
contest, the margin is 47 percent for Schumer to 43 percent for
D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   The Times/CBS News statewide telephone poll was conducted from
last Thursday through Tuesday with 1,461 adults, of whom 1,066 said
they were registered to vote. It has a margin of sampling error of
plus or minus three points. Therefore, among registered voters,
Schumer could be ahead by as much as nine points _ or D'Amato could
be ahead by three points.

<P>
   CHICAGO _ She says he is ``duplicitous,'' a ``wolf in sheep's
clothing'' who has resorted to ``scuzzball'' campaign tactics in
the past. He has described her as ``shrill,'' claims she ``has
nothing positive to say about her own record'' and that her career
has been ``obscured by numerous scandals and controversies.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Senate race between the incumbent Democrat, Carol
Moseley-Braun, and state Sen. Peter Fitzgerald, a conservative
Republican, has become one of the most tensely watched campaigns in
the country. And with less than a month to go, the candidates have
dropped all pretense of keeping the gloves on.
</P>
<P>
   The latest poll, published last week in The Chicago Tribune,
suggests that Ms. Moseley-Braun, elected in 1992 as a radiantly
rising star, is in serious election trouble. She lagged behind
Fitzgerald by 10 percentage points, with more voters saying they
believed Fitzgerald was the more honest and trustworthy candidate.
The poll, which had a margin of error of 3 percentage points, also
suggested that she has lost considerable support among suburban
women, one of the main groups that swept her into office six years
ago in what became known as the ``Year of the Woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Dogged by a series of missteps and poor judgments in her
personal and political life, Ms. Moseley-Braun, 51, who was
catapulted from an obscure Cook County office to become the
nation's first black female senator, has had trouble getting voters
to focus on her legislative accomplishments. And she has been
soundly outspent by Fitzgerald, a 37-year-old multimillionaire from
the Chicago suburbs who inherited his family banking fortune and
spent $7 million of his own money on the Republican primary alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have I not handled my own publicity and image making as well
as I could have?'' Ms. Moseley-Braun said in an interview.
``There's no question about that. Have I not handled the politics
as well as I could have? No question. But I certainly have worked
as hard as I can. I've got a great legislative record. And with all
the things that have been thrown at me, none of them has stuck.''
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald, considered so conservative that most Republican
leaders supported his moderate opponent in the bitterly contested
primary, has wasted no opportunity to try to make Ms.
Moseley-Braun's mistakes stick and to deflect her characterization
of him as an extremist by painting her as an ineffectual liberal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although her career has been somewhat obscured by numerous
scandals and controversies, those who have noticed her voting
record have noticed it is very extreme,'' Fitzgerald said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Across the board, these are tough times for Illinois Democrats.
In the hotly contested race to replace Gov. Jim Edgar, a Republican
who is retiring, Glenn Poshard, a Democratic congressman from
downstate Illinois, trailed George Ryan, the Republican Secretary
of State, by 22 percentage points in The Tribune's poll.
</P>
<P>
   Poshard has alienated liberal Democrats with his opposition to
abortion rights and some gay rights issues, as well as his past
votes against gun control and environmental measures. And he has
tried without much success to tar Ryan with a scandal in which
employees of the secretary of state's office are accused of taking
bribes in return for granting truck licenses, and using some of the
bribe money to support Ryan and other candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats running for other offices, even those in heavily
Democratic Cook County, are running into trouble, too. This year,
the state legislature eliminated straight-party voting in Illinois,
long considered a boon to Democrats. And although Democrats are
hoping that the efforts of congressional Republicans to impeach
President Clinton may spur Democrats to the polls in a kind of
backlash, so far the president's problems have not helped matters
and could lower turnout among Democratic voters. ( Poshard even
stayed away from a Chicago fund-raiser on his behalf which Clinton
attended).
</P>
<P>
   All of that is making things harder for Ms. Moseley-Braun in a
race that has her looking more like a challenger than an incumbent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always thought she was going to be in a tough race, even
against Fitzgerald, but I didn't think it was going to be this
tough,'' said Dawn Clark Netsch, a Democrat who ran for governor in
1994.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   The senator had to press hard to get Fitzgerald to agree to a
debate, which was held on Sunday. After it was over, she said she
had not expected him to try to ``paint himself as a centrist'' and
said, ``I could have made him show his true colors better.''
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald, for his part, said the senator sounded ``shrill'' in
the debate and that she ``wasn't even able to understand what I was
talking about when I was talking about Social Security.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats had hoped Fitzgerald would win the primary because
they believed his conservative views would make him easier to
defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald, who started running for the state legislature soon
after he finished law school, believes his wealth has allowed him
to be more independent in his political views. He opposes abortion,
even in cases of rape or incest, sponsored a bill signed into law
by Edgar that bans same-sex marriages and would screen gay people
out of the military. He would use the federal budget surplus to
provide tax cuts, while Ms. Moseley-Braun would use it to shore up
Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Moseley-Braun, who sits on the Senate Finance Committee, has
concentrated on cleaning up polluted industrial sites in cities,
fixing decrepit school buildings, improving pension laws for women
and fighting for tax breaks on airline tickets and ethanol, issues
important in Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   But from the start, she has also had to fend off accusations
that she misused an inheritance instead of reimbursing Medicaid for
her mother's care, ignored accusations of sexual harassment against
her 1992 campaign manager and former fiance, Kgosie Matthews, and
that she and Matthews spent tens of thousands of campaign dollars
on personal travel, clothes, jewelry and stereo equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Although no investigation found any criminal wrongdoing and Ms.
Moseley-Braun has acknowledged making mistakes in judgment, she has
not been able to shake what she calls her ``negatives.'' A few
weeks ago, when George Will raised these issues in his column, the
senator lost her temper, used a racial slur to portray herself as a
victim of racism and compared Will to a member of the Ku Klux Klan,
forcing her to apologize.
</P>
<P>
   ``She knows that she's in a dogfight. Most incumbents don't want
to debate,'' said Paul Green, a professor of political science at
Governors State University in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   In the remaining weeks of the campaign, Ms. Moseley-Braun, a
charismatic campaigner, said she will work hard to reach
disaffected supporters. Her campaign has raised about $6 million
(compared to the $10 million Fitzgerald has already spent) and has
scheduled fund-raisers with Mayor Richard Daley of Chicago, Clinton
and Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've worked myself already into bad health,'' said Ms.
Moseley-Braun, who was treated last week for bronchial pneumonia at
a Texas hospital after she fell ill on a flight to Dallas. ``I'm
doing everything I know how.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ She says he is ``duplicitous,'' a ``wolf in sheep's
clothing'' who has resorted to ``scuzzball'' campaign tactics in
the past. He has described her as ``shrill,'' claims she ``has
nothing positive to say about her own record'' and that her career
has been ``obscured by numerous scandals and controversies.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Senate race between the incumbent Democrat, Carol
Moseley-Braun, and state Sen. Peter Fitzgerald, a conservative
Republican, has become one of the most tensely watched campaigns in
the country. And with less than a month to go, the candidates have
dropped all pretense of keeping the gloves on.
</P>
<P>
   The latest poll, published last week in The Chicago Tribune,
suggests that Ms. Moseley-Braun, elected in 1992 as a radiantly
rising star, is in serious election trouble. She lagged behind
Fitzgerald by 10 percentage points, with more voters saying they
believed Fitzgerald was the more honest and trustworthy candidate.
The poll, which had a margin of error of 3 percentage points, also
suggested that she has lost considerable support among suburban
women, one of the main groups that swept her into office six years
ago in what became known as the ``Year of the Woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Dogged by a series of missteps and poor judgments in her
personal and political life, Ms. Moseley-Braun, 51, who was
catapulted from an obscure Cook County office to become the
nation's first black female senator, has had trouble getting voters
to focus on her legislative accomplishments. And she has been
soundly outspent by Fitzgerald, a 37-year-old multimillionaire from
the Chicago suburbs who inherited his family banking fortune and
spent $7 million of his own money on the Republican primary alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have I not handled my own publicity and image making as well
as I could have?'' Ms. Moseley-Braun said in an interview.
``There's no question about that. Have I not handled the politics
as well as I could have? No question. But I certainly have worked
as hard as I can. I've got a great legislative record. And with all
the things that have been thrown at me, none of them has stuck.''
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald, considered so conservative that most Republican
leaders supported his moderate opponent in the bitterly contested
primary, has wasted no opportunity to try to make Ms.
Moseley-Braun's mistakes stick and to deflect her characterization
of him as an extremist by painting her as an ineffectual liberal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although her career has been somewhat obscured by numerous
scandals and controversies, those who have noticed her voting
record have noticed it is very extreme,'' Fitzgerald said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Across the board, these are tough times for Illinois Democrats.
In the hotly contested race to replace Gov. Jim Edgar, a Republican
who is retiring, Glenn Poshard, a Democratic congressman from
downstate Illinois, trailed George Ryan, the Republican Secretary
of State, by 22 percentage points in The Tribune's poll.
</P>
<P>
   Poshard has alienated liberal Democrats with his opposition to
abortion rights and some gay rights issues, as well as his past
votes against gun control and environmental measures. And he has
tried without much success to tar Ryan with a scandal in which
employees of the secretary of state's office are accused of taking
bribes in return for granting truck licenses, and using some of the
bribe money to support Ryan and other candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats running for other offices, even those in heavily
Democratic Cook County, are running into trouble, too. This year,
the state legislature eliminated straight-party voting in Illinois,
long considered a boon to Democrats. And although Democrats are
hoping that the efforts of congressional Republicans to impeach
President Clinton may spur Democrats to the polls in a kind of
backlash, so far the president's problems have not helped matters
and could lower turnout among Democratic voters. ( Poshard even
stayed away from a Chicago fund-raiser on his behalf which Clinton
attended).
</P>
<P>
   All of that is making things harder for Ms. Moseley-Braun in a
race that has her looking more like a challenger than an incumbent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always thought she was going to be in a tough race, even
against Fitzgerald, but I didn't think it was going to be this
tough,'' said Dawn Clark Netsch, a Democrat who ran for governor in
1994.
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The senator had to press hard to get Fitzgerald to agree to a
debate, which was held on Sunday. After it was over, she said she
had not expected him to try to ``paint himself as a centrist'' and
said, ``I could have made him show his true colors better.''
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald, for his part, said the senator sounded ``shrill'' in
the debate and that she ``wasn't even able to understand what I was
talking about when I was talking about Social Security.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats had hoped Fitzgerald would win the primary because
they believed his conservative views would make him easier to
defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald, who started running for the state legislature soon
after he finished law school, believes his wealth has allowed him
to be more independent in his political views. He opposes abortion,
even in cases of rape or incest, sponsored a bill signed into law
by Edgar that bans same-sex marriages and would screen gay people
out of the military. He would use the federal budget surplus to
provide tax cuts, while Ms. Moseley-Braun would use it to shore up
Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Moseley-Braun, who sits on the Senate Finance Committee, has
concentrated on cleaning up polluted industrial sites in cities,
fixing decrepit school buildings, improving pension laws for women
and fighting for tax breaks on airline tickets and ethanol, issues
important in Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   But from the start, she has also had to fend off accusations
that she misused an inheritance instead of reimbursing Medicaid for
her mother's care, ignored accusations of sexual harassment against
her 1992 campaign manager and former fiance, Kgosie Matthews, and
that she and Matthews spent tens of thousands of campaign dollars
on personal travel, clothes, jewelry and stereo equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Although no investigation found any criminal wrongdoing and Ms.
Moseley-Braun has acknowledged making mistakes in judgment, she has
not been able to shake what she calls her ``negatives.'' A few
weeks ago, when George Will raised these issues in his column, the
senator lost her temper, used a racial slur to portray herself as a
victim of racism and compared Will to a member of the Ku Klux Klan,
forcing her to apologize.
</P>
<P>
   ``She knows that she's in a dogfight. Most incumbents don't want
to debate,'' said Paul Green, a professor of political science at
Governors State University in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   In the remaining weeks of the campaign, Ms. Moseley-Braun, a
charismatic campaigner, said she will work hard to reach
disaffected supporters. Her campaign has raised about $6 million
(compared to the $10 million Fitzgerald has already spent) and has
scheduled fund-raisers with Mayor Richard Daley of Chicago, Clinton
and Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've worked myself already into bad health,'' said Ms.
Moseley-Braun, who was treated last week for bronchial pneumonia at
a Texas hospital after she fell ill on a flight to Dallas. ``I'm
doing everything I know how.''

 &HT;    Legendary harness driver dreams his way to success
 &HT;    By Tom Archdeacon
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEBANON, Ohio _ The dream came to life _ quite literally _ on a
family farm outside of a small western Ontario, Canada, town in the
mid-1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan Campbell was a farmer, who for four decades had had
modest success with a low dollar string of harness horses on the
country fair circuit and small pari-mutuel ovals. As a Mother's Day
present, Duncan once gave a mare to his wife, Bernice. As fate
would have it, that horse produced a foal on April 8,1966.
</P>
<P>
   That day also happened to be the 11th birthday of grandson John,
who immediately fell in love with the colt, which was named Argyle
Chester. Eventually, Bernice decide to give the boy half ownership
in the colt.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a real big deal,'' John Campbell said. ``I was the
only kid in school who owned a race horse. I just loved that
animal. He was chestnut with two white stockings and a blaze on his
face. He was so flashy. I went to all the races I could and took
him to the paddock. He got me dreaming so much. All I thought about
doing was driving horses when I got older. That's all I wanted to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   John Campbell was recalling that story Monday night in a Lebanon
Raceway stop that was proof once in a while dreams do more than
just come true _ they turn into your wildest fantasy. The Canadian
kid who once dreamed of driving grandma's horse at the local track
has become the best harness driver in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's already got the records and he's just going to keep on
adding to them,'' said Ray Burdette of Old North Dayton, who was
among hundreds of fans lined up to get an autograph or share
chitchat with Campbell before the evening's racing began. ``The
thing about John Campbell, he could take a mule and outrun a
thoroughbred.''
</P>
<P>
   Although just 43, Campbell has won every major race, every
driving title _ and most of them numerous times. He's won the
Little Brown Jug and the Cane Pace each three times, the Messenger
Stakes and the Hambletonian five times. Should he drive Muscles
Yankee to victory in the Kentucky Futurity Friday at the Red Mile
in Lexington, he will become the first Trotting Triple Crown winner
in 26 years.
</P>
<P>
   Already this year, he has won more than $8.6 million in purses,
finishing in the money in 752 of 1,514 races. He's the sports'
all-time money winner with more than $164 million in purses. His
next closest rival is $59 million behind. ``If you don't bet on him
when you're at the track, you should have your head examined,''
said Jim Allen, a Lebanon Raceway patron from Wayne Avenue. ``He's
simply the best of the best.''
</P>
<P>
   In this sport, whenever big money's on the line, the trainers
involved want John Campbell in the bike behind their horse. It's
also why Lebanon Raceway wanted him to make a promotional visit
Monday. Years ago, he raced here twice, but these days _ based in
New Jersey near the Meadowlands and racing the top dollar events
around the globe _ he's beyond the local track circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he hasn't forgotten his roots. And the smaller tracks like
Lebanon _ where the live gate is off nearly 60 percent because of
bumbled state legislation, other gambling and sports draws_ need
the help. Thanks in part to the efforts of the United States
Trotting Association _ of which Corwin Nixon, guiding light of
Lebanon Raceway, is president _ Campbell spent part of the day at
the Warren County track.
</P>
<P>
   Along with a challenge race _ edging local star Mike Wilder _
Campbell also donated $500 of his travel costs to the Warren County
Educational Service School. Nixon then matched the sum.
</P>
<P>
   ``You won't find a better guy in racing,'' Nixon said. ``Look
how he's dealt with the public here. He cares about the people.''
</P>
<P>
   That was never more evident than three years ago when Campbell
got a request from a Mt. Gilead man who wanted the racing legend to
drive a race for a terminally ill friend at the Morrow County Fair.
</P>
<P>
   Don Sipe, the dying man, had a few horses and had dreamed of one
day having an animal good enough to lure Campbell into the sulky.
Campbell showed up and as the stunned and tearful Sipe watched,
drove the colt to a second-place finish. Three weeks later, just
hours after Campbell won the Little Brown Jug with Nick's Fantasy,
Sipe died.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like having Babe Ruth come in to fulfil the last
request of someone,'' Jerry Knappenberger of the Ohio Harness
Horseman's Association said.
</P>
<P>
   What made Campbell so good? He shrugged: ``I really think good
drivers are born, not made. I think it was in my family. My dad
trained and my brother does too.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he's been harness racing's top money winner 12 of the
past 19 seasons, he's also had his share of hard knocks. Thanks to
spills early in his career, he's had four operations on one knee, a
back operation and recovered from a broken wrist and a badly
damaged other knee.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more unusual injuries came in a Meadowlands race when
the driver he was battling wheel-to-wheel accidently whipped him
all the way down the stretch. ``He thought he was hitting his
horse, but he was whaling away on me,'' Campbell said. ``You can't
believe the pain. I was screaming the whole way, but he never knew.
Afterward the welts were up a couple inches all across my back. I
yelled at him, but he had had no idea it was me.''
</P>
<P>
   That's kind of the anonymity he receives in the general public.
Harness racing stars don't often make the jump to the rest of the
world. Still with his dominance, Campbell has made various
high-profile appearances, including throwing out the first pitch of
a New York Yankees game at Yankee Stadium this season.
</P>
<P>
   How did he do? ``When I went to the mound, I made sure it wasn't
a rainbow. Nope, it was nothing but high heat,'' he said with a
laugh. ``Hey, I had to make the most of the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Just like he did as a 11-year-old dreamer with Grandma as a
partner.

 &HT;    'Rocket Boys' author talks of dreams, stars
 &HT;    By Jim DeBrosse
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ When Homer Hickam Jr. tells a room full of
schoolchildren that ``if you want anything badly enough, and you'll
work for it, you can do it,'' the words ring with hard-won truth.
</P>
<P>
   Hickam, 55, who spoke Monday at the Challenger Learning Center
in Dayton, was only 14 when he and his friends in a small West
Virginia coal town spotted Sputnik winking across the sky one night
and were inspired to build a rocket of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Their unlikely success in joining the 1950s space race has been
chronicled in Hickam's memoirs, Rocket Boys (Delacorte, $23.95),
which has soared to No. 20 on the New York Times' best seller list
after only three weeks in bookstores. Next spring Universal
pictures plans to release a motion picture based on the book,
starring Laura Dern and Chris Cooper and produced by the makers of
Field of Dreams .
</P>
<P>
   With the help of their parents, teachers, clergy and a town of
coal miners torn by union strife, Hickam and his five young pals
eventually lobbed a rocket six miles into space, earning first
prize in the West Virginia Science Fair and the gold and silver
medals at the National Science Fair in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   All six boys _ sons of coal miners in a dead-end company town _
went on to earn college degrees (''That was unheard of in Coalwood
at the time,'' Hickam said), and Hickam himself became a NASA
engineer and now author.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never, never, never, never think you can't do something,'' he
told the 50 students visiting the learning center from Dayton's
Kiser Middle School and Fairborn's Black Lane Elementary. ``The
only person and the only thing that can stop you is yourself.'' As
part of a 23-city promotional tour for his book, Hickam spent an
hour talking to and fielding questions from the sixth-, seventh-
and eighth-graders. Queries included the possibility of life
elsewhere in the universe, the prospects for visiting Mars and how
best to stop a killer asteroid headed for Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Samuels, an eighth-grader at Kiser, wanted to know if a
spaceship would continue to accelerate forever across the universe.
``I didn't know like debris and stuff out there would slow it
down,'' he said later.
</P>
<P>
   Khalila Johnson, also an eighth-grader at Kiser, said Hickam's
talk reaffirmed for her the importance of going to college. ``I'm
not really into space travel, but I'm thinking about being an
engineer,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Hickam admits it's unlikely any group of teen-agers will ever
repeat the famed exploits of the Rocket Boys. ``No way,'' he said.
``It was a singular time and place that we six boys were able to do
that _ mainly because we were ignorant of the laws,'' including FAA
rules against launching objects into the path of planes.
</P>
<P>
   Hickam, who retired this year from NASA after working on the
International Space Station and training astronaut crews, is
convinced the time has come to revisit the moon. The recent
discovery of millions of gallons of ice there _ which can easily be
converted to life-sustaining water _ means ``there's some plan out
there,'' he said. ``It means we're going back to the moon.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hickam's brand of can-do optimism doesn't stop at the moon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe we will go to the outer limits of the solar system
and live there. Your children will live there,'' Hickam told the
students. ``Ultimately, I think we will go to the stars.''

PRICES ON NASDAQ AT THEIR LOWEST LEVEL IN 15 MONTHS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo., Md.)  (js) 
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Prices on the Nasdaq stock market declined to their
lowest level in 15 months Wednesday and have fallen 17.25 percent
in just the last eight days of trading. Other market gauges also
continued to slump.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts continued to cite nervousness over financial and
economic turmoil in many parts of the world and unmistakable
evidence that the U.S. economy is being affected. Alan Greenspan,
the chairman of the Federal Reserve, testified Wednesday that he is
trying to avert a slowdown that many economists now fear could
easily turn into a recession.
</P>
<P>
   Nasdaq stocks fell 3.2 percent, or 48.28 points Wednesday, to
1,462.61, a level not seen since July of last year. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500-stock index lost 1.41 percent, or 13.91 points, to
970.68, and avoided a new low with a modest late-session rebound.
The Dow Jones industrial average moved up in the morning but then
faded to close with a loss of 1.29 points at 7,741.69.
</P>
<P>
   European markets were also mostly lower. Stocks fell 2.90
percent on the main German index, 1.24 percent in France and
52/100ths of 1 percent in Britain. Brazil's market closed 2.84
percent lower and the Nikkei index of 225 issues jumped 6.17
percent, the biggest gain of the year, while the Hong Kong market
rose 2.38 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the general drubbing, however, analysts found some grounds
for encouragement. One was that the march to lower interest rates,
normally the stock investor's friend, stopped.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was one of the few days when stocks went down and the
bond market didn't go up,'' said Christine Callies, chief
investment strategist at Credit Suisse First Boston. ``Possibly the
capital flight into the U.S. dollar may be winding down.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors around the world have been piling into Treasury
securities as a safe haven so Wednesday's contrary action may
suggest diminished worry about what has been described as the worst
financial crisis since World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts also pointed to some further signs that corporate
profits in the third quarter may be a bit better than the market
has been led to expect.
</P>
<P>
   Some multinational companies with sizable overseas earnings
posted hefty market gains Wednesday, benefiting from the decline in
the dollar on currency markets _ 2.3 percent on a trade-weighted
basis. McDonald's, for example, rose 2 13/16, to 61 1/16, while
Procter &AMP; Gamble rose 3[, to 77].
</P>
<P>
   Banks and brokers, on the other hand, were pummeled again.
Citicorp dropped 5 3/16, to 79 13/16, more than $100 a share less
than the peak of $182 set April 6. Merrill Lynch fell 4 3/16, to
37}, barely one-third the stock's value of 109[ set four days
before the Dow hit its record high of 9,337.97 on July 17.
</P>
<P>
   Bankers Trust, which traded as high as 136 7/16 in April, lost
another 4[ Wednesday to close at 49 3/16.
</P>
<P>
   The financial sector is exposed to meltdowns overseas and to
hedge fund and other borrowers here whose ability to repay is in
doubt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a tug of war going on between those who think
international efforts to stem the financial crisis are working and
those who think they're not doing enough,'' said Andy Brooks, head
of stock trading at T. Rowe Price Associates in Baltimore. He said
it seemed of late that ``all the forces at work in the market seem
to be causing investors to be scared about staying in.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Knight, portfolio manager at Columbine Asset Management
in Colorado Springs, expressed frustration that several of the
factors that have traditionally proved good predictors of stock
valuations are no longer working.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said stocks with high price-earnings ratios have
``dramatically'' outperformed stocks with low p-e's in recent
months, reflecting investors' focus on big-name companies with
growth stories at the expense of lesser companies with greater
intrinsic value.
</P>
<P>
   Knight said this ``overreaction'' reflected shaken confidence on
the part of investors, who in addition to favoring ``feel-good''
stocks are also paying more attention than in the past to companies
with solid dividends.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq's drop was marked by sizable losses in technology,
its dominant category. Dell Computer fell 4}, to 50 9/16, Microsoft
was down 3{, to 94[, Yahoo plunged 10 7/16, to 114] and eBay fell
5|, to 30~ after trading as high as 54\ when it first reached the
market two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange, new lows swamped new highs by
535 to 66 while declines outpaced advances by 2,136 to 1,012.
Volume was heavy at 977.05 million shares.

<P>
   That's how more Americans than ever think _ if they think at all
_ when they pay with plastic. It's one of the big reasons we set
records for personal bankruptcies three years in a row, and why
Congress is determined to stop the streak.
</P>
<P>
   The debate has been filled with talk about a nation of deadbeats
that seems to contradict widespread elation over a booming economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears to be an anomaly, but it isn't,'' said Samuel
Gerdano, executive director of the American Bankruptcy Institute, a
research organization. ``The same consumer spending that helps
drive and sustain the economy is putting families into debt.''
</P>
<P>
   And not just poor families. A new survey by the American Bankers
Association found that 45 percent of credit-card holders with
incomes between $50,000 and $100,000 never pay off their balances.
</P>
<P>
   Many others don't even make the minimum payments and fall behind
on the interest. Debt counseling services across the country are
seeing more middle-to-upper-income clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to see people who were in debt for a small amount of
money: $20,000 or $30,000,'' said Jean Brannan of Consumer Credit
Counseling Service of Palm Beach County, and Florida's Treasure
Coast. ``Now, we have people with over $100,000 in credit-card
debts.''
</P>
<P>
   Even people who are already in debt are being bombarded with
credit-card offers, and most have been conditioned to think of
spending as something akin to a patriotic duty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem really is that a lot of people are just getting
by,'' said Gerri Detweiler, author of The Ultimate Credit Handbook
and several other books on personal finances. ``Even if they're
making good money, they're not prepared for anything happening
financially.''
</P>
<P>
   Anything includes divorce, corporate cutbacks, business
setbacks, major medical expenses _ common hazards of modern life.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have five or six cards with a balance on each, and
they're not really paying attention to anything except the minimum
monthly payment,'' Detweiler said. ``Then, all of a sudden, they
don't have the same income, and it throws them into a financial
tailspin.''
</P>
<P>
   If that has you punching up your mental calculator, factor in
this:
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a combination of lots of debt and not much
savings, you are a candidate right now for bankruptcy,'' Detweiler
said.
</P>
<P>
   The tumble from prosperity is often hard, fast and startling.
Many people make the mistake of confusing available credit with
ability to pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Credit-card companies are in the business of selling money,''
Brannan said. ``They always want you to buy more.''
</P>
<P>
   Seductive credit offers have played a major part in the debate
over proposals to make it harder to file for bankruptcy. While
conceding that personal debt is an increasing problem, many
Democrats say lenders bear considerable responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Republican majorities passed personal bankruptcy bills in both
houses, although the Senate version passed last month isn't quite
as tough, and both versions backed away from early proposals to
give credit card debts the same priority as child support, Gerdano
said.
</P>
<P>
   Both versions would force consumers to seek counseling and
negotiate settlements before asking for court protection, and
that's likely to be part of any compromise bill. It's a step many
people are already taking on their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing more people who still have good credit and aren't
behind on their bills,'' said Arne Nielsen, community outreach
specialist for Consumer Credit Counseling. ``That's why they're
alarmed: They're making payments every month, but their credit-card
balance isn't going down.''
</P>
<P>
   Minimum payments required by lenders barely chip at the
principal. A $1,000 credit card charge at 18 percent interest _
less than some department store accounts _ will take nine years to
pay off at $20 a month. Meanwhile, you'll pay about as much as you
borrowed in interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``And all the time, people keep charging,'' Nielsen said.
</P>
<P>
   The rising monthly tide has encouraged many to pay off their
high-interest card debts by taking out home equity loans, which are
often tax deductible. One survey showed $26 billion of credit-card
debts have been paid off that way in the past two years, but 70
percent of those card holders immediately started charging again.
</P>
<P>
   It can be a dangerous strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can't pay your credit-card bill, the worst that will
happen is they'll call and send you a letter,'' said author
Detweiler, who is also education adviser to the Internet-based Debt
Counselors of America. ``They're not going to throw you in jail. If
you can't pay a home equity loan, you can lose the roof over your
head.''
</P>
<P>
   There is some encouraging news about debt: It isn't rising as
fast as it was a few years ago. Household debt is up about 6
percent this year, which is down from last year's 8 percent,
according to federal figures.
</P>
<P>
   And Americans are generally trying harder to be responsible. The
percentage of cardholders who pay their balances in full each month
is up from 29 percent in 1992 to 42 percent, while the percentage
who fail to make even minimum payments is down to 3.28 from 3.69 at
this time last year.
</P>
<P>
   Still, only 41 percent of households say they spend less than
their income, according the American Bankers Association, and 15
percent spend more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too many people still look on credit cards as supplementary
income,'' Brannan said.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say there is no profile of the modern debtor. Men are
considered less likely to worry about money and security and more
likely to show off, but the spending impulse is nearly gender
equal.
</P>
<P>
   Women are more likely, however, to be caught short by divorce,
experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're often shocked to find out they're still responsible
for debts no matter what the divorce decree says,'' Brannan said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the least vulnerable are older people who grew up with a
pay-as-you-go ethic and never fell into the plastic habit. Among
the most vulnerable are young people, who are now deluged with
credit-card offers in college but who haven't been taught how to
use credit wisely.
</P>
<P>
   Almost everyone could benefit from a moment's hesitation before
making a charge, Brannan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to learn how to make plastic feel like money,''
Brannan said. ``We need to feel the same pain of separation when we
take it out of our wallets.''

 &HT;    Young children, teens not imune from clinical depression
 &HT;    By Jim DeBrosse
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ When their mild-mannered 16-year-old daughter
suddenly became the teen-ager from hell _ defiant, belligerent,
into drugs and premarital sex _ Bob and Doris Riley (not their
actual names) blamed the bad crowd she had started running with.
</P>
<P>
   But a family counselor soon found an underlying cause the Dayton
parents had never suspected _ their daughter was suffering from
clinical depression.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew she had been abused by her stepfather when she was
about 8 or 9, but we didn't realize we were seeing the delayed
effects of that,'' said Bob Riley, who eventually got custody of
his daughter. ``She had been pushing it down all those years.''
</P>
<P>
   After seven months of intensive, daylong therapy through South
Community Behavorial Health Care's youth services program, the
Rileys got their old daughter back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Afterward, she was making much better decisions and doing
better in school,'' her father said. ``And she got rid of her old
friends who were causing a lot of the problems.''
</P>
<P>
   For many years, childhood depression was thought to be a
contradiction in terms. Mental-health professionals had assumed
kids were not emotionally mature enough to suffer from depression.
There wasn't even an official diagnosis for it until 1980.
</P>
<P>
   With more research and better diagnostics, professionals know
now that it does exist, even in very young children, and far more
often than many parents realize. The National Institute of Mental
Health estimates that nearly three in every 100 American children
younger than 18 _ or more than 1.5 million children and adolescents
_ are seriously depressed.
</P>
<P>
   The shame is that so few children are being treated for it, in
part because it is often masked by other behavioral problems, said
Dr. David G. Fassler, co-author of a new book on childhood
depression, ``Help Me, I'm Sad'' (Viking, $22.95). ``It is still
significantly unrecognized and underdiagnosed, which is a tragedy
because it's highly treatable,'' Fassler said.
</P>
<P>
   Untreated depression in children can lead to severe emotional
and developmental setbacks as well as further episodes of
depression. Studies show that half of children with untreated
depression will lapse into the condition again within three years.
</P>
<P>
   In the worst case, of course, depression can lead to thoughts of
suicide. Studies show at least 9 percent of all high school
students have attempted suicide, some more seriously than others,
Fassler says. The rate of suicide has doubled among teens over the
past 30 years, making it the second-leading cause of death among
children ages 15 to 19, according to the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   Now is a good time for concerned parents to act.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday is National Depression Screening Day, when thousands of
sites across the country will be offering free education and
screenings for the disorder. ``Any parent who thinks that their
child may be depressed should get an evaluation, and National
Depression Screening Day is an excellent opportunity to arrange
that in a convenient way with good local resources,'' Fassler said.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned parents also should talk to their child's
pediatrician, says Joy Ott, a psychologist at Children's Medical
Center. The pediatrician will be familiar with the child's medical
history and also can make a referral to a mental-health
professional.

 &HT;    Rabbi whose prayer Clinton recited urges us to look at ourselves
 &HT;    By Steve Gushee
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The rabbi who wrote a prayer President
Clinton used did not write a sermon about him.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Jack Riemer may be the only preacher in the country who
did not speak about the president's moral problems on Yom Kippur,
the Jewish day of atonement, last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose of the day is to focus on our own sins,'' said
Riemer, who leads Congregation Beth Tikvah in West Boca Raton, Fla.
``It is a cop-out to discuss and debate his (Clinton's) sins
instead of our own. I did not speak about what's happening in
Washington for the High Holidays.''
</P>
<P>
   But he did write the prayer, On Turning, that the president read
Sept. 12 at the national prayer breakfast. Clinton used the prayer
about repentance as part of his continuing campaign to confess the
sinfulness of his relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was given a copy of the prayer by a friend, Miami lawyer
Ira Leesfield, with whom he visited following a money-raising event
in September. Leesfield wanted a gift to give his famous guest and
asked his rabbi, who suggested a copy of the prayer, Riemer said.
</P>
<P>
   When the president read the prayer, Riemer became an instant,
national sensation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost every paper in the country called me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But, for the High Holy Days, he resisted using the president's
problems and focused instead on calling for all religious people to
look at their own sinful ways.
</P>
<P>
   He preached four sermons through Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur.
Each explored a biblical story. None mentioned Clinton. All were
aimed at the congregation.
</P>
<P>
   ``In every case, the biblical story was a mirror in which we saw
ourselves,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Riemer is convinced that Judaism must be relevant to the modern
day if the ancient faith is to be compelling.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote the prayer Clinton found so useful last month as part
of a volume of contemporary prayers when serving a synagogue in
Dayton, Ohio, in the '70s.
</P>
<P>
   On Turning uses nature's cycle to demonstrate the process of
turning. Leaves turn colors in the fall in the same season when Yom
Kippur calls men and women to turn from their sin. Birds turn
south. Animals turn from summer's frolic to storing winter's food.
</P>
<P>
   But nature's process is natural, Riemer wrote. Human turning or
repentance demands an act of the will and is difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means breaking old habits. It means admitting we were
wrong. It means saying: I am sorry,'' Riemer wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The popular prayer is now used throughout the country in the
Gates of Repentance high holidays prayer book of Reform Judaism.
</P>
<P>
   ``My feeling was that if Judaism was going to be meaningful, we
needed new prayers in the language of our day about the issues of
our times,'' Riemer said.
</P>
<P>
   ON TURNING, written by Rabbi Jack Riemer
</P>
<P>
   Now is the time for turning.
</P>
<P>
   The leaves are beginning to turn from green to red to orange.
</P>
<P>
   The birds are beginning to turn and are heading once more toward
the South.
</P>
<P>
   The animals are beginning to turn to store their food for
winter.
</P>
<P>
   For leaves, birds and animals, turning comes instinctively. But
for us, turning does not come so easily.
</P>
<P>
   It takes an act of will for us to make a turn. It means breaking
old habits. It means admitting that we have been wrong; and this is
never easy. It means losing face; it means starting all over again;
and this is always painful. It means saying: I am sorry.
</P>
<P>
   It means recognizing that we have the ability to change. These
things are terribly hard to do. But unless we turn, we will be
trapped forever in yesterday's ways.
</P>
<P>
   Lord, help us to turn _ from callousness to sensitivity, from
hostility to love, from pettiness to purpose, from envy to
contentment, from carelessness to discipline, from fear to faith.
</P>
<P>
   Turn us around, O Lord, and bring us back toward you. Revive our
lives, as at the beginning. And turn us toward each other, Lord,
for in isolation there is not life.

 &HT;    Wright Brothers' hometown may see key space program fly away
 &HT;    By Timothy R. Gaffney
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Dayton may greet the 100th anniversary of powered
flight by losing a key part of the space program it pioneered in
the 1960s: nuclear generators and heaters for deep space probes.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Department of Energy announced Friday in the Federal
Register its intent to relocate the work from the Mound Plant in
Miamisburg. This would remove the last remaining DOE mission,
allowing the agency to vacate the site by February 2003.
</P>
<P>
   The year 2003 will mark one century since Daytonians Orville and
Wilbur Wright made the world's first powered flight.
</P>
<P>
   DOE is considering moving the work to one of five sites in
Idaho, Nevada, Tennessee, Texas and Washington. It plans to hold a
public hearing at each site, including at Mound, in November.
</P>
<P>
   Removing the last work involving radioactive isotopes from the
site would strike a blow to commercial redevelopment efforts, said
Michael J. Grauwelman, director of the Miamisburg Mound Community
Improvement Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe the program really does fit and support where the
region is going,'' Grauwelman said. Most of the businesses that
have sprung up there have leveraged Mound expertise or equipment to
start high-tech enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   The work itself has involved about 40 highly skilled jobs,
including engineers and scientists.
</P>
<P>
   DOE and program managers at Mound could not be reached for
comment Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Grauwelman said he isn't bothered by the program's use of
plutonium-238, a radioactive isotope that is not used in weapons
but is extremely toxic. It's already encased in metal capsules when
it arrives on the site, he said, and the two buildings that house
the operations are separate from commercial activities.
</P>
<P>
   The Mound operation assembles devices called RTGs and heat
sources. RTGs _ short for Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators _
have powered every space probe to the outer planets beyond Mars.
The plutonium gives off heat, and RTGs convert the heat into
electricity. Heat sources use plutonium heat to keep delicate
spacecraft equipment from freezing in the cold of space.
</P>
<P>
   While RTGs made it possible for NASA to send space probes to
Jupiter, Saturn and beyond Pluto, they have also caused
controversy. About 500 people protested the space agency's most
recent launch of an RTG-powered probe, the Cassini spacecraft
launched toward Saturn in 1997, because it carries about 72 pounds
of plutonium.
</P>
<P>
   Cassini's two RTGs have been feeding it electrical power
steadily and should continue to work long after the spacecraft
loops into orbit around Saturn in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the facility that made the RTGs may not last so
long.

 &HT;    He reached top, but paid top dollar
 &HT;    By Greg Stoda
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Patrick Leyland, with his father and his
father's World Series ring in hand, toddled off to first grade at
St. Bernard's in Mt. Lebanon, Pa., for a show-and-tell class
Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``How much did it cost?''
</P>
<P>
   That was the first question posed to Patrick's dad, Jim, who, an
hour or so after visiting his son's school, phoned his Florida
Marlins employers and told them he was quitting as their manager.
</P>
<P>
   So, honestly, Leyland could have answered the boldly inquisitive
child by saying, ``About $7,000 and my job.''
</P>
<P>
   Because, in a convoluted way, that's the truth.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the Marlins' improbable run to the 1997 baseball
championship was simply too high. Many of the players who carried
the team to the title were traded in an effort to reduce costs this
season. Leyland was left to lead what was left of the Marlins, who
promptly dissolved into the worst team in the sport.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why Leyland's decision to skip town should come as no
great surprise to anyone who paid attention as he squirmed through
a 108-loss season.
</P>
<P>
   The man will be 54 years old by the time spring training rolls
around again, says his next gig will probably be ``my last
go-'round'' and wants no part of a rebuilding process let alone the
kind of massive reconstruction the Marlins have only begun to
undertake.
</P>
<P>
   South Florida?
</P>
<P>
   See ya.
</P>
<P>
   Leyland said all the right things during a Thursday morning
teleconference. He had been ``so fortunate to be a Florida Marlin''
and the two years were a ``great ride, in many ways'' and he'd
always remember ``we accomplished the ultimate.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaving with three years remaining on his contract, he said,
amounted to simple resolution of a ``business decision that didn't
work out.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, it worked out well financially for Leyland. He's a wealthy
man.
</P>
<P>
   But the baseball part of the deal fell apart just when it
appeared the Marlins were on the verge of establishing themselves
as a force. The problem arose when team owner H. Wayne Huizenga,
only now in the process of selling the team after announcing his
intention to do so 16 months ago, found the cost of winning those
championship rings too expensive for his taste.
</P>
<P>
   The purge began in the wake of Florida's victory in the World
Series last October.
</P>
<P>
   Leyland said Thursday he was ``surprised and disappointed, but
not angry'' when he he first heard in June 1997 of Huizenga's plan
to sell. But his sense ``that something wasn't right'' in the
middle of that summer grew until he was ``shocked that everything
happened so fast'' as the team was dismantled.
</P>
<P>
   Leyland had no fun this year.
</P>
<P>
   He respected the kids who swallowed the losses and stood up to
the ridicule, but that's all.
</P>
<P>
   He's tired of baseball's shaky economics, which have forced him
out of Pittsburgh and Florida since the end of the 1996 season.
That's why _ when the phone rings with someone offering a job with
a team on good financial ground and not so far removed from playoff
possibilities (see: Colorado) _ Leyland will go.
</P>
<P>
   Is being with a contender so important?
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, yes,'' Leyland said.
</P>
<P>
   Other than the World Series season, he has managed teams to
losing records five of the past six years. And losing is what these
Marlins will be about for quite a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the ring,'' Leyland tells himself these days.
</P>
<P>
   And try to forget what it cost.

 &HT;    Austin Ventures adding $250 million to portfolio
 &HT;    By Lori Hawkins
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Austin Ventures, Central Texas' largest venture
capital firm, is raising another $250 million to invest in
fast-growth companies in Austin and the Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   The new fund will bring the total amount of money managed by
Austin Ventures to more than $700 million, making it the largest
venture capital firm in the Southwest based on amount of money
under management. Dallas-based Sevin Rosen Funds is second with
$500 million in six funds.
</P>
<P>
   The size of the fund points to the increasing number of
high-tech startup companies in Central Texas and the growing
competition among venture capitalists to invest in those companies.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two years, software, Internet and semiconductor
startups in Austin have raised record amounts of money from a
greater number of venture firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``A fund this large is very good for Austin because it will get
people's attention outside the area,'' said Clark Spurrier, a vice
president with Morgan Stanley's technology group in New York.
``It's a great sign for the Austin tech community that a local VC
firm can raise this kind of money with the intention of investing
it in Austin and the surrounding region.''
</P>
<P>
   Austin Ventures has received commitments for most of the $250
million, and expects to close the fund in early November.
</P>
<P>
   The fund is likely to reach $300 million by the time it closes,
sources said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The breadth and depth of the entrepreneurial and senior talent
in Austin is expanding rapidly, and we believe there are a lot of
promising investment opportunities both on the tech and non-tech
sides,'' said John Thornton, a general partner with Austin
Ventures.
</P>
<P>
   Austin Ventures has been a key factor in the growth of many
Austin high-tech startups, investing $161million in 42 Austin
companies since 1984.
</P>
<P>
   It hopes to maintain its role, which is why it is raising a
record amount of money and adding employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are planning for this business to become more
competitive,'' said Joe Aragona, a general partner with Austin
Ventures. ``We don't know if a new firm will move in with five
guys, and we don't know if a West Coast firm is going to come in
and open shop. So if you have that level of uncertainty, what do
you do? We said let's get 18 world-class people and we will compete
straight up on value-added resources.''
</P>
<P>
   Startups use the venture money to develop, market and sell
products. In return, the investors get a piece of the company.
Venture capitalists make money when the company is acquired or
sells stock to the public.
</P>
<P>
   The high failure rate of new companies makes venture investment
risky.
</P>
<P>
   Austin Ventures has declined to reveal its return, but says its
performance is in the top 25 percent of venture funds. Area
companies raised a record $165 million in venture money last year,
and have pocketed $95 million during the first half of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   At least 10 venture firms have Austin offices.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, SSM Ventures, recently closed on a new $113 million
fund, which it will invest in Texas and the Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   Austin Ventures has increased its investment team to 18 people,
11 of which will focus on high-tech.
</P>
<P>
   The company has hired a new general partner, Ed Olkkola, who was
most recently the vice president of business development and
strategy at Compaq Computer Corp. in Houston. He will lead the
company's communications and computer networking initiative in
Austin and Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   It has also recruited Tivoli Systems veteran Chris Grafft as a
venture partner in the technology group, where he joins Jim Clardy,
co-founder of Crystal Semiconductor and Jimmy Treybig, founder of
Tandem Computers.
</P>
<P>
   At Tivoli, Grafft was a member of the executive committee and
had roles including vice president of development and senior vice
president of products. Austin Ventures expects that over three
years it will invest in 25 to 30 early-stage and more mature
companies in high-tech and nontechnology industries. Investments
will range from $250,000 to $15 million.
</P>
<P>
   Austin Ventures plans to begin investing the new money by
Thanksgiving.

 &HT;    Et tu, Linda! Back stabbers are `most toxic of all terrors'
 &HT;    By Loretta Grantham
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Treat your friend as if he will one day be your enemy, and
your enemy as if he will one day be your friend.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Laberius, 105-43 B.C.
</P>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Although Linda Tripp didn't invent
betrayal _ Pontius Pilate, Brutus and Benedict Arnold beat her to
the punch _ she certainly excelled at it.
</P>
<P>
   But despite her deception (complete with wire and tapped phone),
Tripp doesn't deserve all the credit. Monica Lewinsky, after all,
played into her hand.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp falls squarely into the category author Lillian Glass
calls the Smiling Two-Faced Backstabber, in her book, Toxic People.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of us find the Smiling Two-Faced Backstabber to be the
most toxic of all terrors,'' she writes. ``In fact, in Dante's
Inferno, the final circle of hell was reserved for perpetrators of
the most heinous sin of all _ betrayal.... These chameleon-like
people are scary, for they change depending on what you need to
hear.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed. One minute Tripp chats about diets, haircuts and sex to
Lewinsky as if she's a sorority sister, despite their age
difference. Then, Tripp deals the mommy trump card because that's
what Lewinsky _ childishly confused and insecure, although she was
playing a grown-up game _ needed to hear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel entirely too maternal towards you,'' the older woman
said. ``When I yell at you, it's out of love.''
</P>
<P>
   No, Linda, it's out of manipulation. Because while Tripp's
methods are textbook, so are her motives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deep inside, back stabbers resent you but don't have the guts
to confess that they are angry or upset or even envious,'' Glass
says.
</P>
<P>
   Another bull's-eye: Tripp had fallen out of favor with the
Clintons, was angry about being kicked out of the White House and
was most certainly jealous of Lewinsky's power to demand a new job.
Hoodwinking the younger woman meant taking control.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as George H. Green and Carolyn Cotter put it in Stop Being
Manipulated, ``Herein lies an irony. The person who is trying to
manipulate you views you as having greater power than she does.''
</P>
<P>
   Go figure. In reality, the intern had the upper hand, not the
Washington veteran.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky, however _ because of inexperience, naivete, just plain
lack of intelligence or a combination thereof _ didn't know this.
Instead, she allowed herself to be victimized, and it's easy to see
why: She craved approval. And assumed a position of weakness to
earn it.
</P>
<P>
   In Clare Booth Luce's 1936 play The Women, Luce satirizes five
ladies who lunch _ and gossip, connive and back stab all under the
guise of caring for one another. On one hand, they seek approval.
But on the other, they secretly despise each other for being so
needy.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Lewinsky felt a boost when Tripp called her a
``Marilyn Monroe vixen'' who would eventually ``come home to an
opportunity to get together with (Clinton).'' But how was Lewinsky
to know what she heard wasn't really encouragement but instead an
egging-on that would backfire?
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, regrettably, it's impossible to know because, as
Karen Lehrman writes in The Lipstick Proviso, ``There will always
be malicious women who backstab, who use `sisterhood' as a way to
be resentful, malicious and vindictive.''
</P>
<P>
   But, experts say, there are warning signs that deception _ and
possibly betrayal _ is at hand:
</P>
<P>
   The manipulator becomes almost giddy with power and energy while
the victim becomes depressed and more dependent.
</P>
<P>
   The manipulator elicits personal details from the victim without
revealing any of her own, creating an imbalance in the
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   The manipulator preys on the fact that she shares a common bond
with the victim. (In the case of Tripp and Lewinsky, that would be
employment in the White House.)
</P>
<P>
   The manipulator _ because of the savvy that comes with age and
experience _ has a personal agenda, while the victim just wants to
``share'' or ``vent.''
</P>
<P>
   The manipulator shifts roles _ from empathizing buddy to
protective mother, for example _ to meet her own needs, not those
of the victim.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line is, betrayal is a fact of life. But, as Riki Robbins
writes in Betrayed!, a victim's first step toward recovery is
forgiveness _ first for herself and then eventually for the person
who tricked her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Betrayal means a loss of innocence, especially because it most
often happens to those who are most vulnerable,'' Robbins says.
``The lesson is not to be cynical, but never to reveal too much too
soon. With diligence and faith, the betrayed can learn to trust
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It requires opening yourself up enough to return to the school
of life.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Monica Lewinsky has learned some hard lessons.

 &HT;    Raising breast cancer awareness
 &HT;    By Marylin Johnson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In support of October as Breast Cancer Awareness
month, companies have created exclusive cosmetics and apparel to
wear or give as reminders of this disease, which kills 43,000
American women each year. And stores are offering special
promotions.
</P>
<P>
   Events and items range from a fashion show featuring breast
cancer survivors to a powder compact festooned with a pink ribbon,
the symbol of awareness. A percentage of sales of each item or
promotion goes to breast cancer research or programs.
</P>
<P>
   The company promotions and sponsorships of awareness events,
along with nationwide races organized by the Susan G. Komen
Foundation, have raised awareness.
</P>
<P>
   Though only one cent of every $10 collected in federal taxes
goes to govern-
</P>
<P>
   ment-supported cancer research, breast cancer gets a large share
of that money. The government spent $2.7 billion on cancer research
last year, and about $500 million went toward breast cancer,
compared with $100 million for prostate cancer, which kills an
estimated 40,000 American men each year.
</P>
<P>
   This year's Race for the Cure in Atlanta will be held at 8:30
a.m. Oct. 24, beginning at the Atlanta Civic Center, 395 Piedmont
Ave. N.E. (Information: 770-565-4692.)
</P>
<P>
   A sampling of promotions:
</P>
<P>
   _ Estee Lauder is selling a translucent powder compact accented
with a ``jeweled'' pink ribbon motif ($35) and a ``jeweled'' pink
ribbon-trimmed lipstick case ($10), at Lauder counters. Also, a box
of 12 notecards featuring landscapes photographed by Evelyn Lauder
($12.50) is available exclusively at Macy's. All net proceeds go to
the Breast Cancer Research Foundation. Free pink ribbons and
bookmarks listing hotlines and Web sites of cancer organizations
are also at Lauder counters.
</P>
<P>
   _ Two other Lauder companies are adding support. Available at
Clinique counters is a pink lipstick in a pouch ($7.50), with half
of the proceeds going to the foundation. Origins will donate $1
from the sale of its new pressed powder compact ($22.50) and its
liquid foundation ($15) to the foundation.
</P>
<P>
   _ Jeweler Carolee has designed a gold heart pin crossed with an
enameled pink ribbon ($25). At Rich's Lenox Square and Perimeter
Mall; $5 from the sale of each pin goes to the foundation.
</P>
<P>
   _ Crystal manufacturer Swarovski created the Compassion pin _ a
crystal bouquet of flowers tied around the stems with a pink ribbon
($150). The company will donate a minimum of $25,000 to the
American Cancer Society Breast Cancer Network. At the Mole Hole at
Phipps Plaza, Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   _ Avon is introducing a pale pink cosmetics case ($3) with a
pink ribbon-and-rose zipper. All proceeds will go to breast cancer
programs. For an Avon representative, call: 1-800-367-2866.
</P>
<P>
   _ California designer Karen Neuburger has done brushed-cotton
pajamas patterned in a rose-and-pink-ribbon print ($56). A portion
of the sales will be donated to the Nina Hyde Center at Georgetown
University. Nordstrom.
</P>
<P>
   _ When accessories designer Marcia Stevens Sherrill found out
members of her family had breast cancer, she wrote ``Portraits of
Hope: Conquering Breast Cancer,'' (S Editions, $24.95). The author,
who has a boutique in Atlanta, Kleinberg-Sherrill, had Rosie
O'Donnell write the foreword. Among the 52 male and female breast
cancer survivors who tell their stories are former first ladies
Nancy Reagan and Betty Ford and chef and author Julia Child. Two
Georgians are included: Miriam Adamson, Ms. Senior America of Pine
Mountain; and Judy Roberts, a marketing representative of Marietta.
All proceeds will be donated to the National Alliance of Breast
Cancer Organizations. To order: 1-800-932-0070, Ext. 214.
</P>
<P>
   Each time you make a purchase using your American Express card
at Saks Fifth Avenue or Neiman Marcus, American Express will donate
25 cents to the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation. Saks will
also make a 25 cent donation to the Komen Foundation when customers
use the store's charge card.
</P>
<P>
   Neiman's is selling a $200 ``Ticket to a Cure.'' Each
participant will be entered for a chance to win a Neiman's shopping
package worth more than $65,000. All proceeds go to the Komen
Foundation.

 &HT;    Plastic explosives: Credit cards recklessly shattered one man's
life
 &HT;    By Douglas Kalajian
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Five years ago, Len Rodriguez's life was
moving far too fast to allow even a glance at a credit-card balance
that was accelerating faster than his red Corvette.
</P>
<P>
   Roses and limos for dates. Trips to New York and the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was nothing for me to go out dancing and spend $300,'' said
the former body-builder. ``All on the Visa.''
</P>
<P>
   The car was an essential part of his self-absorbed lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to impress everybody,'' he said. ``It was a
mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   With an income approaching $70,000, Rodriguez was certain he
could pay off his bills. Then his income took a sudden, sharp drop,
but the interest on his debt kept compounding.
</P>
<P>
   What happened to Rodriguez is typical of problems faced by many
middle-income people who leave themselves nothing to fall back on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had nothing saved,'' he said. ``I'd even borrowed on my
credit cards for the down payment on my house.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, who won the title Mr. West Palm Beach, earned most of
his income as a personal trainer based in a Wellington, Fla. gym.
When he moved to a gym that closed soon after, he was reduced to
living on his county lifeguard's salary of $24,000 while trying to
pay off more than $9,000 in credit-card debts.
</P>
<P>
   He kept up the payments on his house and car but couldn't
stretch to cover even the minimum on his credit cards. He began
ducking calls at home and work. He got friends to say he was out.
</P>
<P>
   ``You learn to lie,'' he said. ``It's embarrassing.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez checked into claims by several credit-restoration
companies but was put off by the fees and skeptical of their
claims. ``It sounded crazy that I should pay them on top of
everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   But he was impressed by Consumer Credit Counseling Service, a
nonprofit agency. He contributed the cost of postage (about $4 a
month), and, in return, the agency negotiated with his creditors
for lower payments. With his minimum reduced to $250 from more than
$400, Rodriguez took extra jobs to begin chipping at the balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided to look for things in my field so I could use this
as an opportunity to get ahead,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Part-time lifeguard duty on Miami Beach meant several 140-mile
round trips each week but also gave him a boost in experience that
allowed him to move from pool to beach duty in his regular job.
That gives him a better shot at advancement.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez also filled off-hours and weekends with a variety of
other jobs, including hotel valet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't going to do anything crazy or illegal,'' he said. ``I
believe the way to pay your bills is to work.''
</P>
<P>
   He made enough progress by last year to marry the woman he'd
courted with all those limos and roses. Last week, he got the first
credit report in four years showing his credit cards have been paid
in full.
</P>
<P>
   He's planning to trade in the Corvette for a family car and has
no plans to go back to gym work, even though it would pay well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like a drug addict who's been through rehab,'' he said.
``I need a different environment.''

 &HT;    Ban red? No, make gangs dress better
 &HT;    By John Kelso
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ I'm so smart I need an extra skull for all these
bright ideas. I have the solution to the gang/dress code problem.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than make law-abiding high school kids change clothes,
why not make the gang members dress stylishly like they used to?
</P>
<P>
   Instead of taking kids out of class at Round Rock High for
wearing red clothing to school, why not make the gangs spend some
money on proper, traditional, fashionable gang clothing like the
mob goons used to wear?
</P>
<P>
   That way, we would know where the gang members are, and the
other kids could wear what they want. And as a side plus, our gang
members would be better dressed.
</P>
<P>
   It's disturbing, isn't it, the way gang guys these days slob
around in tacky attire. The ball caps cocked sideways, the gym
shoes, the baggy jeans worn at half-mast like these guys have just
been pantsed.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, for the good old days, when manicured hoods wore neatly
pressed, high-dollar clothing purchased from upscale men's clothing
outlets like Hart Schaffner &AMP; Marx.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when organized crime prided itself on its
threads.
</P>
<P>
   Why, a guy couldn't land a job hanging somebody on a meat hook
unless he was attired in a $500 pin-striped double-breasted suit
with wide lapels, a black shirt with matching $50 white silk tie, a
pair of wingtip shoes from Florsheim and a felt fedora.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, what do you see today among our young criminals?
You got it. Slobby gang members, decked out in equally slobby gang
colors.
</P>
<P>
   The sad part is the rest of us suffer from the gangs' current
lack of elegance. Take the students at Round Rock High, for
example. Since red is a color commonly worn by gangs, the
administration at Round Rock High has outlawed red clothing in
school. Red is a prominent color for the Bloods, Round Rock's
largest gang, school Principal Sherry Blackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Is it fair to pick on red? Of course it isn't. What's next? Are
we going to redo the Lone Star flag and replace the red with, say,
tangerine? Where does it stop?
</P>
<P>
   So instead of making the law-abiding change clothes, why not
make the bad guys wear more attractive clothing?
</P>
<P>
   Instead of making the parents of the good kids spend money on
new clothing that isn't red, why not make the gang members dress
more snappily?
</P>
<P>
   Get with the parents of these duds dummies and tell them to take
the little so-and-sos out to the stores and put them in something
stylish.
</P>
<P>
   This would not necessarily cost an arm and a leg, either. There
are budget polyester alternatives out there that are a major
improvement over current gang attire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have the double-breasted suits,'' said Larry Washington,
manager of Suit City, next to Montgomery Ward at Capital Plaza in
North Austin.
</P>
<P>
   To make that gang member look more fashionable, Washington
suggested ``something like a navy blue, or the gray, or maybe a
brown'' suit, with a ``white, or maybe a cream color'' shirt.
</P>
<P>
   So how much money would this outfit set a gang kid back?
</P>
<P>
   ``Just your basic blue or brown would cost you $119.99 for the
suit alone,'' Washington said. ``You can get a shirt for $15.99,
and you can get a tie set which comes with the hanky for $11.99.''
</P>
<P>
   Shoot, with an outfit like that, a gang kid could even get into
his own funeral.

 &HT;    Since I'm a Daytonian, what will my tombstone say?
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ ``Y'all are the hu-uu-b of the universe,'' my
friend Lynne, a Texan, used to say when she lived here, endlessly
amazed by all the things that had been invented in Dayton.
</P>
<P>
   Lynne was right, of course. The obituary in Monday's paper seals
it. Myron E. Scott, former Dayton Daily News photographer and
advertising manager for Chevrolet, not only started the Soap Box
Derby _ in Dayton, no less _ he gave the Corvette its name. Came
home one day in 1953, after 300 suggested names had been tossed
out, thumbed through the ``C's'' in the dictionary, and stopped at
``corvette'': ``a speedy pursuit ship in the British navy.''
</P>
<P>
   Imagine _ having one certifiable accomplishment that could be
engraved on your tombstone, something everybody would understand:
``He named the Corvette.''
</P>
<P>
   I scratched my head, wondering how my most significant
achievements would translate into granite: ``She kept an epically
messy desk.'' ``She got her son to school on time one morning in
1997.'' Ah, to be among that roster of Daytonians, who, though
obscure in name, achieved things that are world-renowned and easy
to summarize.
</P>
<P>
   Ever heard of John B. Morton? In 1930, he changed your life
(arguably, not for the better). Yet what a clean, elegant epitaph:
``He invented the parking meter.''
</P>
<P>
   Small wonder Lynne was impressed with the accomplishments of
Daytonians, and not merely the ones with the famous names.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the following:
</P>
<P>
   In 1942, Dayton artist H. Richard Black penned the drawing for
Smokey the Bear. In 1956, he sketched Mr. Clean.
</P>
<P>
   In 1953, Barrett Green developed the microencapsulation process
that made the world safe for carbonless copy paper.
</P>
<P>
   In the early '50s, Leland Clark Jr. invented the heart-lung
machine, his most famous among more than 80 inventions.
</P>
<P>
   In 1955, Ermal Fraze (he of Pavilion fame) invented the pop-top
beverage can.
</P>
<P>
   Paul McEnroe developed the bar code for IBM in the late '60s.
The idea was born on graduation day at UD in 1959, when, as
valedictorian, McEnroe discussed point-of-sale technology with an
NCR executive receiving an honorary degree the same day.
</P>
<P>
   Pound puppies were born and bred in Martinsville in 1984, and
first marketed in Lebanon, the creation of soft-sculpture artist
Becki Manning.
</P>
<P>
   Then there were famous figures who influenced history in
unlikely ways. Katharine Wright, along with a Frenchwoman who flew
with her famous brothers, created the short-lived French craze for
the ``hobble skirt.'' The women would sit on the edge of the wing,
``and to preserve modesty tied a rope loosely around the skirt, so
it wouldn't billow in the wind,'' explained Wilkinson ``Wick''
Wright of Miamisburg, great-nephew of the Wright brothers.
</P>
<P>
   What a woman: pioneering aviatrix and fashion icon. Makes you
really feel like an underachiever, doesn't it? But maybe being
known for One Big Thing would have its disadvantages. What do you
do if you're Orson Welles and you're 26 and you make the greatest
American movie of all time? What's the next step if you're the ad
man who names the Corvette?
</P>
<P>
   Better to muddle through in mediocrity, and not fret about that
epitaph. This, I think, will do quite nicely: ``Here lies Mary, who
managed to get through life without accomplishing much of anything,
even though she lived in the hu-uu-b of the universe.''

 &HT;    In Austin high tech, networking is a must for growing companies
By Kim Tyson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ You might call Bucky Couch an accomplished
networker.
</P>
<P>
   Couch, a founder of Austin-based World.hire, which develops
recruiting software, makes a point to go to at least one lunch a
week with fellow business executives. He goes to networking groups.
He attends trade group meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, he does whatever he can to network _ whenever he can.
</P>
<P>
   And it has paid off. Networking has landed Couch's company
countless clients and business tips. Tuesday, he and an executive
with another software company shared the low-down on a potential
financial backer over a lunch at a local Vietnamese-Chinese
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though Austin is big, it's a small town,'' Couch says.
Networking _ whether over lunch, at parties or even on the Internet
_ is essential to any business. But in a town like Austin, it can
be key to growing small high-tech businesses like World.hire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you have to force yourself,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Thompson, known by some as the ``Networking Queen of
Austin,'' says that unlike some East Coast cities, Austin is known
for its open sharing of advice among small, growing high-tech
companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a relationship city,'' says Thompson, founder of The
Thompson Group, which coaches company executives on everything from
where to make the right contacts to how to talk with key executives
and be taken seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, a company executive has to give information before he
or she can get information, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Austin they want to know more about you before they do
business with you,'' she said. ``Some people get frustrated because
it's a, quote, 'longer dance.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, who was chairwoman of the Greater Austin Chamber of
Commerce in 1992 before starting her company, says many Austinites
have lived here fewer than five years. She says the bevy of
newcomers means many are looking to build their base of business
contacts through various professional gatherings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knowledge is your greatest competitive advantage,'' she says.
But given the little time executives have to spend on networking
while running their small, growing companies, ``it comes down to a
strategic use of time,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson says strategic networking includes being in the right
place to meet the key people and getting invitations to the more
high-profile technology social functions. She says these are
important times to pass out business cards and meet people who may
be helpful later.
</P>
<P>
   Networking can be especially painful for some high-tech
executives, Thompson says. That's because many high-tech executives
are engineers who would rather talk technology with a friend than
about potential sales leads with a stranger. Austin marketing
consultant Laura Ricci says even in the global marketplace, studies
show that most people are only a few personal contacts away from
knowing the person they're trying to meet for their businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more people you know, the shorter the path to being able
to make a personal connection with those decision makers,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   For Ricci, networking to increase her high-tech business
includes having four or five business meetings over a meal each
week, going to luncheons, checking out networking Internet sites
and belonging to online groups that exchange e-mail advice. For
example, since she does a lot of government procurement consulting
for clients, she belongs to an online service affiliated with trade
group American Proposal Management Professionals.
</P>
<P>
   Jan Triplett, co-founder of the Entrepreneurs' Association, says
owners of small high-tech companies typically network so they can
discuss particular business or technology issues with others facing
the same concerns.
</P>
<P>
   For example, today the association's 15-member High Technology
Networking group has its monthly meeting. The organization also has
groups that meet each month to network that are specifically for
multimedia companies, inventors, electronic commerce and online
Internet service providers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not necessarily a good way to find a job if you're job
hunting, but it's a way to find an alliance,'' Triplett says.
``People come up with concrete practical ideas; it's not just
chit-chat.''

 By STEVEN A. HOLMES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The number of Americans who died from AIDS fell to
16,865 last year, almost half the number of the year before and
well below the 43,000 deaths in the peak year of 1995, government
figures released Wednesday show.
</P>
<P>
   The increased access to new and effective drug treatments took
the death rate from AIDS to the lowest since 1987, the first year
epidemiologists tracked mortality data related to the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at the National Center for Health Statistics said
that the number of deaths in 1997 decreased by 46.4 percent from
the 31,130 people who died from the illness the year before. The
fall in AIDS deaths was much steeper than the previous record
decrease _ the 29 percent drop from 1995 to 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Still, other studies show that the annual rate of new infections
of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, has remained stable at about
40,000 in the United States in recent years, which means that more
and more people are living with the virus. But longer life means a
greater chance of infecting others, officials said, and they
expressed concern that the good news is bringing a complacency
about the deadly disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``This reflects the tremendous power of the new combination drug
therapies, the enormous effort to get the drugs to people and the
huge federal effort to pay for these drugs,'' said Secretary of
Health and Human Services Donna Shalala of the drop in AIDS deaths.
``What this also tells us is that we have serious problems when we
have not brought down the rate of new infections.''
</P>
<P>
   News of the drop in AIDS deaths is contained in the report on
vital statistics, produced twice a year by the National Center for
Heath Statistics. Based on an examination of birth and death
records provided by the states, the latest report shows that many
of the leading causes of death, like AIDS, homicide, heart disease
and cancer, which were once considered scourges, now are at record
or near-record lows.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, when adjusting for the country's aging population, the
death rate in 1997 was the lowest on record, 478.1 per 100,000
people. The report indicated that only 48 more people died last
year than in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   One result of the startling decline is that AIDS went from the
eighth leading cause of death in the United States in 1996 to the
14th in 1997. Once the leading cause of death of people 25 to 44
years old, the disease is now the fifth leading cause of death for
that age group.
</P>
<P>
   Other highlights of the report include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Infant mortality fell to 7.1 deaths per 1,000 live births, a
record low, from 7.3 the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   _ Life expectancy for those born in 1997 rose to 76.6 years, the
highest ever recorded.
</P>
<P>
   _ A 7 percent decline in death rates for black males, mainly the
result of the continuing drop since 1993 in the overall homicide
rate.
</P>
<P>
   _ Declines of 3 percent in the death rate for heart disease and
of 2 percent in the death rate from cancer.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But it was the sharp drop in the death-rate from AIDS that
surprised researchers the most. ``We expected there to be a
decline, but we didn't expect it to be quite so big,'' said Robert
Anderson, a statistician at National Center for Health Statistics
and the author of the mortality section of the report. ``We
expected to see something on the order of 29 or 30 percent. We're
talking about 15,000 fewer deaths than the year before. In terms of
the human equation, that's a big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers and other experts credit the increased use of newer
combinations of drugs, including those known as protease
inhibitors, with preventing people who are infected with HIV from
developing full-blown AIDS and with keeping those who have the
disease from succumbing to opportunistic infection that in the past
easily and painfully killed them.
</P>
<P>
   These new drugs have now been widely available for about three
years, and some experts say the country is beginning to see the
fruits of these new therapies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now have the ammunition and already made a major positive
impact on HIV-infected individuals when it comes to longevity and
quality of life,'' said Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, director of the
National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.
</P>
<P>
   But even as researchers and AIDS advocacy groups rejoiced over
the hefty declines in AIDS deaths, many expressed concern that
apparently the rate of people becoming infected by the virus that
causes AIDS has not gone down. Some researchers and advocates say
this indicates that while great strides have been made in treating
the disease and, therefore, forestalling deaths, efforts aimed at
preventing the spread of the disease have not borne fruit.
</P>
<P>
   That, some epidemiologists say, presents a new set of worries. A
much larger number of people who are infected with the AIDS virus
are now living longer, and, therefore, have a much greater chance
of infecting others.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have people who, in the past, might have been very ill, in
bed, not able to be sexually active who now are much more active
and potentially could continue to pass on HIV,'' said Dr. Helene
Gayle, director of the National Center for HIV, Sexually
Transmitted Diseases and and Tuberculous Prevention. ``We don't yet
know if people on these therapies are less infectious or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, some researchers say there are signs that complacency
is seeping into the population of people who are most susceptible
to HIV infection. Researchers report an upsurge in unsafe sexual
practices among gay men, and, they say it remains difficult to
carry out effective prevention programs among intravenous drug
users.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is great news,'' Dr. Gerry McQuillan, senior infectious
disease epidemiologist at the National Center for Health Statistics
said of the drop in AIDS death. ``But, I have a 23-year-old son,
and I'm periodically shocked when he says things, like, `It's not a
problem anymore, right Mom?'''

MILOSOVIC INSISTS TROOP PULLBACK NEGATES THREATENED NATO STRIKE  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By JANE PERLEZ    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ President Slobodan Milosevic of
Yugoslavia insisted in talks with the American envoy Richard
Holbrooke that he had ordered enough forces out of Kosovo in the
last few days to avert a threatened NATO attack, an American
official said here Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   But the official said that because of the rotation of Serbian
forces in and out of Kosovo it was not possible to know whether the
movements Milosevic described were a ``net outflow or not.''
</P>
<P>
   The withdrawal of the extra army and police units that Milosevic
sent to Kosovo to put down an insurgency by ethnic Albanian
separatists is at the heart of Washington's demands as it pushes
for NATO to be given the final authority to use force against
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``They claim they are returning to pre-crisis numbers,'' the
official said. ``We need to know that.''
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke left here Wednesday night after his talks with
Milosevic, the man with whom he sealed the Bosnia peace agreement,
stretched over three days. Holbrooke and the U.S. official stressed
that the talks were difficult but declined to offer any specific
detail on where the differences lay. The U.S. official acknowledged
that the diplomatic monitoring mission, whose U.S., Russian and
European military experts travel around Kosovo, reported that for
the sixth day Wednesday they had not seen any significant military
action in the province.
</P>
<P>
   As Holbrooke left, a number of embassies made preparations to
evacuate families and nonessential staff. The chief concern,
diplomats said, was not cruise missiles' hitting embassies or
diplomats' homes but the danger that diplomats and their families
could be taken hostage.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Several embassies, including the Americans', were organizing
convoys of cars for their staff and dependents that were scheduled
to leave Belgrade on Thursday and head north toward Hungary.
</P>
<P>
   In downtown Belgrade, Serbs started to stock up on survival
essentials such as candles and canned goods, and many people said
they were angry and nervous. According to a Serb radio station,
Serbian-language programs of the BBC, Voice of America, Radio Free
Europe and Deutsche Welle will be banned as long as there is a
threat of NATO action.
</P>
<P>
   The likelihood of a threatened NATO attack against Yugoslavia
seemed to seesaw all day.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials said Germany's new government had to get
parliamentary approval for a German endorsement of the use of force
against NATO.
</P>
<P>
   In Israel, where Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was
winding up a visit, her spokesman, James Rubin, said, ``Nobody is
in a rush to use force.''
</P>
<P>
   And in London a meeting of the so-called contact group of
countries that monitor the Balkans was scheduled for Thursday by
the British Foreign Office, canceled and then rescheduled after
Albright said she wanted to attend.
</P>
<P>
   A Western diplomat who has been involved in developments in
Belgrade and at NATO headquarters in Brussels in the last few days
said that the situation was so fluid that his prediction changed
from minute to minute on whether air strikes would take place or
not.
</P>
<P>
   The diplomat said that despite a drumbeat of statements from
Washington about using force against Serbia for its crackdown on
ethnic Albanian civilians, every effort was being made to avoid air
strikes.
</P>
<P>
   And as uncertainties remained over how a consensus on NATO force
would be reached, Holbrooke's encounters with Milosevic over Kosovo
appeared to be different in tone and direction than the meetings
the two men had over settling the war in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   First, diplomats said that Holbrooke, who thrives on controlling
a situation, was not in charge to the same degree as he was in the
Bosnia talks. He came as a messenger for President Clinton to tell
Milosevic about what he had to do comply with a U.N. resolution
calling on him to withdraw his forces and encourage refugees to
return. But he also had to calibrate his discussion with the mood
at NATO, the diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   Second, Holbrooke has been engaged in Kosovo on an on-again,
off-again basis. He tried to broker a settlement between
politicians representing the majority ethnic Albanian population of
Kosovo and Milosevic in May and June but then turned his attention
to other things.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Holbrooke has said that a solution for Kosovo is more
complex than in Bosnia, where he was able to negotiate with the
heads of sovereign countries. Because Kosovo is a Serbian province,
outside intervention is harder to justify.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke recently described the bind that the West finds itself
in. ``The core of the problem is that the Serbian behavior has been
outrageous and unjustifiable but the Western nations do not support
Albanian independence,'' he said. ``And finally there is no
Albanian leadership for negotiations.''

 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Testifying before Congress in June, Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan called the U.S. economy the best he had
ever seen. Less than four months later, he is trying to avert a
slowdown that some economists now fear could easily turn into a
recession.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking before a group of economists in Washington, Greenspan
said Wednesday that the outlook for the United States had
``weakened measurably'' and hinted that the Fed was ready to reduce
interest rates further if the financial turmoil that began last
year in Asia continued to spread.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan still marveled at the continuing combination of low
inflation, low unemployment and steady U.S. growth, which have
sustained what is about to become the nation's longest peacetime
expansion. But he fretted about the ``somewhat scary psychology''
afflicting financial markets and focused on the expectation that
consumers would sharply cut back their spending because of the
steep drop in stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   And on a day when one of the nation's largest banks forecast
that the United States will slip into recession next year,
Greenspan suggested that the confusing and countervailing forces
buffeting the economy have left policy makers without a clear idea
of how serious a slowdown might be in the offing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economy has remained in reasonable shape, with good growth
and low if not declining inflation,'' Greenspan said in remarks in
Washington to the National Association for Business Economics.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we are clearly facing a set of forces that should be
dampening demand going forward to an unknown extent,'' he said.
``We do not know how far it will go or how much it will affect
consumer and business spending here at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan went on to say that this is ``a time for monetary
policy to be especially alert.'' Investors took that phrase to mean
the Federal Reserve is prepared to follow up its quarter-point cut
in the federal funds target rate last week, to 5.25 percent, with
further reductions in coming months.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours after Greenspan spoke, economists at J.P. Morgan in
New York became the first from a major institution to forecast a
recession next year.
</P>

   Morgan said it expects no growth in the first quarter of 1999, a
decline in economic output of 2 percent in the second quarter and 1
percent in the third quarter, followed by a return to growth of 1.5
percent in the fourth quarter. Morgan had previously projected
growth of about 1 percent over the next year.

<P>
   ``The extra weakness has been triggered by the further
deterioration in domestic financial markets in recent weeks,'' said
a report from James F. O'Sullivan, an economist at Morgan.
``Although a downturn could still be avoided, it would likely take
a prompt reversal of recent financial market deterioration, or
particularly quick and aggressive support from policy easing.
Neither are anticipated.''
</P>
<P>
   While not ready yet to predict an end to the current expansion,
which began in March 1991, other economists said they increasingly
see the economy as fragile and vulnerable to further shocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sense is that recession risks have risen dramatically, that
recession is just as likely as a normal slowdown now,'' said James
Glassman, an economist at Chase Securities in New York. ``It
wouldn't make sense for a Fed chairman to make that case, but if
you read between the lines of his speech you can see a heightened
concern about developments in the financial markets and tightening
credit conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks Wednesday, delivered from notes rather than from
his usual rigorously prepared text, Greenspan often seemed to be
pondering how the United States had suddenly been put at risk by
the forces that have sent Asia into a deep recession and spread
through Russia into much of the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen anything like this,'' Greenspan said at one
point, referring to the flight of investors out of any instrument
perceived to have some risk and into the safe haven of Treasury
bonds, which are guaranteed by the U.S. government and are always
easy to buy and sell.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, Greenspan presented both the positive and negative
elements of the outlook, but analysts said his emphasis was on the
risks to the economy, which he has laid out in increasingly
explicit terms lately.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan said the economy still had ``a fairly significant
continued momentum.'' Its performance, he said, is ``really still
quite an impressive sight,'' with job growth remaining healthy and
inflation pressures muted.
</P>
<P>
   While he acknowledged that it was becoming more difficult and
expensive for businesses to borrow money in the debt markets and
from banks, Greenspan said that ``we are far short of anything that
could resemble a credit crunch in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Greenspan said, there is not much evidence of a slowdown
in capital investment by business or on spending by consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, if you look at the physical aspects of the economy as
a whole, it is very difficult to find any real variable impact as
yet,'' he said. While job growth slowed last month, unemployment
claims remain low, ``and anecdotal evidence still indicates that we
are confronted with fairly tight labor markets and labor markets
which are still putting some pressure, if perhaps not accelerating,
on the overall wage structure,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Greenspan dwelled at length on the risks to the economy from
the latest round of turmoil in the global markets, set off in
August when Russia effectively defaulted on its debt, sending
investors fleeing not just from other emerging markets, but also
from high-yield ``junk'' bonds and other investments that suddenly
seemed risky.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan, who saw one of the underlying causes of the 1990-91
recession as a credit crunch stemming from problems in the banking
business, said the problems facing the economy now would be
exacerbated if lenders and investors continued to pull back.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is occurring is a broad area of uncertainty or fear,'' he
said. ``And when human beings are confronted with uncertainty,
meaning they do not understand the rules of the terms of particular
types of engagement they're having in the real world, they
disengage.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fed chairman noted that exports were declining, hurting
manufacturers and farmers. But he soon returned to the potential
psychological shocks from the global turmoil, especially the
effects on consumers of the stock market's downturn.
</P>
<P>
   He estimated that $1.5 trillion in wealth had been wiped out
since the stock market's peak in July.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's got to show up somewhere,'' Greenspan said, adding that
``we're bound to see the major impact in personal consumption
expenditures and housing,'' two sectors that have driven the
economy for the past several years.
</P>
<P>
   William Dudley, an economist at Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. in New
York, said Greenspan's comments were ``very much slanted towards
the risks to the economy'' and that his characterization of the
economy as weakening measurably was ``a fairly strong statement
from a Fed chairman known for being opaque.''
</P>
<P>
   That Greenspan is acutely aware of how quickly the economy can
slide into recession is understandable in light of his experience
with the 1990-91 recession, when he, like most economists, failed
to see at first that the economy had tipped from sluggish growth
into economic contraction.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not tilted down,'' Greenspan said in September 1990 _
two months after the recession later was shown to have started.

CLINTON SAYS HOUSE MEMBERS SHOULD VOTE THEIR CONSCIENCES ON
IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL and LIZETTE ALVAREZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton said on Wednesday that House
members should ``cast a vote of principle and conscience'' on an
impeachment inquiry Thursday, as Democratic leaders polished an
alternative proposal designed to draw as many party members as
possible away from the Republican plan to authorize a broader
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's remarks gave House Democrats facing tough re-election
fights room to set their own course as the House votes to begin
only the third impeachment inquiry into a president's actions. He
spoke as some Democrats openly complained that they were tired of
White House pressure to short-circuit an inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Stopping short of some Democrats' hopes that he would tell them
to vote alongside Republicans and put the burden on them to be
fair, Clinton told reporters, ``It's up to others to decide what
happens to me and ultimately it's going to be up to the American
people to make a clear statement there.'' First Lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton and other aides, however, did keep up an effort to convince
the undecided to vote for their party's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   With the House under the control of a Republican majority, it is
certain to vote against the Democrats' call for a limited inquiry
into Clinton's deceptions of his relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
It will then move to pass the Republicans' broader impeachment
resolution, modeled on the one used to begin the Watergate inquiry
a quarter of a century ago, calling for Clinton to be investigated
``fully and completely.''
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the vote, a letter sent to the Judiciary Committee
by Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel, only bolstered the
Republicans' drive for an open-ended inquiry. Responding to a query
last week from the committee, Starr said that he ``cannot foreclose
the possibility of providing the House of Representatives'' with
additional findings of possible impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Starr would only say that some matters remained under active
investigation, although he made clear in his referral to Congress
that a sexual harassment accusation by Kathleen Willey, a former
White House volunteer, remained unresolved. Clinton has denied
under oath any misconduct with Ms. Willey.
</P>
<P>
   The phrasing of the Republicans' resolution leaves open the door
for the inquiry to move in any direction.
</P>
<P>
   With several dozen agonized Democrats still uncertain how they
will vote, Democratic House leaders went from meeting to meeting on
Wednesday looking for a way to preserve a semblance of party unity
and to prevent many of their members from joining the Republicans
on the crucial vote.
</P>
<P>
   After an impassioned and divided two-hour closed Democratic
caucus, House Democratic leaders revised their own inquiry
proposal, bringing it ever closer to the Republican version.
</P>
<P>
   The new Democratic plan calls for an investigation to end on
Dec. 31. It also leaves open the possibility that any inquiry could
move beyond Clinton's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky should Starr
present more evidence of impeachable offenses on other issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got a Republican proposal,'' said Rep. Dick Gephardt,
the House minority leader. ``You've got a Democratic proposal. Both
of them launch an inquiry. The question is how we're going to do
this. And a lot of our members feel very strongly that this should
be done right. This is a high moment for the House of
Representatives.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic leaders seemed resigned that they would lose anywhere
from two dozen to 60 party members on Thursday's vote. These
Democrats are expected to first vote for the Democratic plan, and
when that fails vote for the Republican plan.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond counting votes and reshaping their alternative, the
leadership was not pressuring House Democrats on how to vote. Rep.
Gary Ackerman, D-N.Y., said his party's leaders were most concerned
about minimizing losses in the looming mid-term election and
``don't want to drown anyone'' by trying to force party unity.

U.S. SAYS IT CAN TIE BIN LADEN TO EMBASSY BOMBINGS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By BENJAMIN WEISER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Federal prosecutors in Manhattan said Wednesday that
one of the men accused of conspiring to bomb the U.S. Embassies in
Kenya and Tanzania in August had met earlier with Osama bin Laden,
the suspected mastermind of the attacks, and ``asked him for a
mission.''
</P>
<P>
   The reported meeting between bin Laden and the accused man,
Mohamed Rashed Daoud Al'Owhali, which had not previously been
described, is the strongest allegation offered so far to link bin
Laden to the attacks, in which more than 250 people died.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting, which prosecutors said took place in 1996, is
reported in a new 48-page indictment of Al-'Owhali and three others
that a federal grand jury in Manhattan returned Wednesday. It shows
how prosecutors are continuing to build the circumstantial case
that bin Laden, a Saudi businessman in exile, was behind the
embassy bombings and other attacks against Americans stationed
abroad in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors did not indicate bin Laden's response to the
offer; he is not charged in the new indictment.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment does not indicate whether prosecutors have any
evidence that bin Laden directly ordered the bombings, or whether
they may argue that he inspired a group of followers to carry out
the attacks. Bin Ladin has called for attacks on U.S. and other
Western interests.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, in issuing the new charges against men suspected of
being bin Laden's associates, the government also declared more
concretely than previously that bin Laden has been a major backer
of terrorism groups worldwide. Its list of terrorist groups
includes Al Jihad in Egypt and the Islamic Group, which is led by
Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, who was convicted in 1996 in the plot to
blow up landmarks in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment asserted that bin Laden's organization, Al Qaeda,
worked on its own and through Al Jihad, Islamic Group and others,
which ``operated under its umbrella.''
</P>
<P>
   The authorities also gave their first account of what they
called bin Laden's network of businesses and front companies in
Sudan that he allegedly used to raise money to support terrorism
and to provide cover for the acquisition of explosives, weapons and
chemicals, and the travel of his associates.

TALIBAN SAID TO WEIGH TRIAL FOR BIN LADEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (See also BOMB-INDICT)  
(JT) 
 By DOUGLAS JEHL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO _ The Taliban movement in Afghanistan might consider
putting Osama bin Laden on trial for a 1996 bomb attack that killed
19 American airmen in Saudi Arabia, a leading Saudi-owned newspaper
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden, the Saudi-born Islamic militant who lives in
Afghanistan, has long been suspected of involvement in that and
other attacks on Americans, including the Aug. 7 bombings of two
U.S. Embassies in Africa. He has been indicted in the United
States, charged with terrorist acts committed before the embassy
bombings.
</P>
<P>
   But efforts to bring bin Laden to justice have been hamstrung by
the fact that the Taliban, which control most of Afghanistan, is a
militant Islamic movement whose leaders who have said they will not
hand him over to the United States or to anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   The report, in the London-based newspaper Al Hayat, that the
Taliban might consider trying bin Laden themselves could not be
independently confirmed. A senior Taliban diplomat reached by
telephone in Pakistan dismissed it as ``baseless.''
</P>
<P>
   But Al Hayat is generally a reliable source on matters involving
the Saudi government, and it reported that the Taliban had
communicated the offer to Saudi Arabia as a good-will gesture.
</P>
<P>
   If it is true, the report would suggest that the Taliban might
at least be reconsidering their position on bin Laden, which has
deeply complicated its relations with the West and with Saudi
Arabia, one of only three countries in the world to recognize the
militant movement as Afghanistan's legitimate government.
</P>
<P>
   Saudi Arabia has never charged bin Laden or anyone else in the
1996 bombing, and any specific American accusations linking bin
Laden to that attack have been spelled out only in a sealed
indictment. But U.S. officials have said they have learned enough
about the bombing, of an American military compound in the eastern
Saudi city of Dhahran, to regard bin Laden as a prime suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Saudi Arabia, which stripped bin Laden of his citizenship in
1994 because of his militant activities, has turned up pressure
against Afghanistan in a clear show of protest at the sanctuary
provided there to him.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, it expelled the Afghan charge d'affaires and
recalled its own top envoy from Kabul, the Afghan capital, saying
that the moves were ``in keeping with national interest.''

IF IT WINS, JUSTICE DEPARTMENT WANTS TOUGHER PUNISHMENT FOR
MICROSOFT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Increasing the stakes in their legal battle against
Microsoft, government lawyers now say that if they win their case
they will seek a special court proceeding to determine a punishment
that would prevent future illegal anti-competitive conduct by the
company.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials would not elaborate on what type of
punishment they expect to seek, but outside observers said the
possibilities could include anything from requiring government
pre-approval of Microsoft contracts and products to requiring a
breakup of the company.
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft antitrust trial is scheduled to begin Oct. 15, but
the Justice Department and Microsoft are seeking to delay it until
Oct. 19. At the trial, lawyers for the Justice Department, 20
states and the District of Columbia will attempt to prove that
Microsoft has a monopoly on computer operating systems and has
illegally sought to extend that monopoly into the market for
Internet browsers.
</P>
<P>
   The trial is expected to last up to two months, and one lawyer
involved in the case has already predicted that whatever happens,
the case is likely to be appealed all the way to the U.S. Supreme
Court.
</P>
<P>
   To date, the government has sought to only to force
modifications to the company's Windows operating system so that it
does not include Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser or so that
it also includes the Navigator browser manufactured by Netscape
Communications Corp. Few observers have expected that punishment,
if imposed, to have a major impact on Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole issue of relief is a subject unto itself, and the
government would want to reserve the right to open a debate on that
subject because the relief they have prayed for so far doesn't look
terribly effectual,'' said Phil O'Neill, an antitrust lawyer with
Jackson &AMP; Campbell of Washington D.C. ``There's certainly nothing
that would make Microsoft any less of a competitor.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposal for a special punishment proceeding was made by
government lawyers in a court filing released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Depending on the nature and scope of the violations determined
by the court at trial, plaintiffs will seek such additional
permanent relief as is necessary to restore competitive conditions
and to prevent Microsoft from committing similar violations in the
future,'' the filing said. ``To that end, plaintiffs may request
that the court conduct additional proceedings for the purpose of
hearing evidence concerning such additional relief.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department and state officials declined to elaborate,
but antitrust scholars said the paragraph had two purposes: to warn
Microsoft of the government's serious intention, and to leave the
door open for more Draconian remedies than have been proposed to
date.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft spokesman Mark Murray said ``We don't think it's
appropriate to even speculate on potential remedies, because we
believe the facts and the law are clearly on our side.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This filing is proof of the government's bait-and-switch
attempt,'' he said, noting that the original penalties sought by
the government related directly to the issue of Internet browsers.
``First they tried to rewrite their allegations against Microsoft,
and now they're trying to rewrite the penalties that they asked for
back in May.''
</P>
<P>
   Four antitrust experts said the punishments could theoretically
include a breakup of the company, but added that such a move would
be highly unlikely because the structure of the company is not
directly related to the company's alleged violations. They said
more likely remedies sought by the government would include the
invalidation of existing Microsoft contracts with computer
manufacturers and others, pre-review by the government of future
integrated products made by Microsoft, and imposition of new
regulations limiting contact between employees working in the
operating system and application divisions of Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should suspect that statement was put in there a shot across
the bow to Microsoft, and indeed to preserve the government's
options,'' said James Ponsoldt, a former senior trial attorney at
the Justice Department during the Ford and Carter administrations
who now teaches antitrust law at the University of Georgia School
of Law.
</P>
<P>
   Warren Grimes, a former Federal Trade Commission attorney who
now teaches antitrust law at Southwestern University Law School,
said, ``This might be a way of trying to psych out Microsoft, and
suggest that anything is open. They might ask for divestiture, but
I don't see that as very likely.''
</P>
<P>
   Grimes said the government also might try to demonstrate that
Microsoft's conduct toward Netscape is part of a pattern reflected
in its conduct toward other companies and necessitating broader
punishment than proposed thus far.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Justice Department has made it clear that it's receiving
additional evidence of other predatory actions, and more than
likely additional relief would relate to that additional
information,'' Grimes said. ``This certainly would increase
Microsoft's level of concern.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles ``Rick'' Rule, a head of the Justice Department's
antitrust division during the Reagan administration who is now a
lobbyist for Microsoft, said the separate penalty phase may just be
a way for Justice to expand its case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given that the judge has limited each side to 12 witnesses,
and they're going to have a heck of a time proving their
substantive case, they may be doing this to buy themselves some
extra time and witnesses,'' Rule said. ``The remedies they have
already proposed are preposterous in and of themselves, and if they
are to have any chance of trying to defend them on appeal they
would have to develop a record.''
</P>
<P>
   Rule said of the possibility that the Justice Department might
seek to break up Microsoft, ``I can't believe that they're now
buying off on the approach of doing something really stupid, but
who knows?''

WORLD FINANCE MEETING ENDS WITH NO GRAND STRATEGY BUT MANY IDEAS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The world's finance ministers and central bankers
ended five days of debate Wednesday with nothing approaching a
strategy to lift the global markets out of their downward spiral,
but with a plethora of new ideas that some officials insisted would
ultimately bear fruit.
</P>
<P>
   All week the mood was so pessimistic that one European finance
minister left Washington insisting, ``I've had more fun at
funerals.''
</P>
<P>
   At times the officials politely sparred with President Clinton
and Michel Camdessus, the managing director of the International
Monetary Fund. They argued over which European countries should cut
interest rates and how much, and whether too much austerity imposed
by the West would lead to the breakup of Russia or more bloodshed
in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   But they agreed repeatedly and publicly that the chief villain
in this drama is Japan, with a supporting cast of avaricious hedge
fund managers and currency speculators.
</P>
<P>
   Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda, the Thai finance minister, said ``not
much'' had been accomplished. He was treated as something of a cult
hero because his country's economy has hit bottom and now seems to
be crawling back. ``I'm afraid the markets will be disappointed,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Finance Minister Yannos Papantoniou of Greece agreed with the
sentiment, bemoaning ``the lack of clear political will to move in
any direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who did not expect much progress nonetheless said they saw
glimmers of hope. Weary from days of meetings and nights of
glittering receptions that seemed oddly out of sync with the mood
of gloom, they talked about Britain's proposal to establish what
would amount to a Ministry of the Global Economy _ a standing
committee on global financial regulation that would try to get the
International Monetary Fund, financial regulators and private
industry marching in a single direction.
</P>
<P>
   Many said the world now understood the dangers of financial
secrecy, though they were bickering about just what kind of closely
held data countries and financial institutions should publish.
</P>
<P>
   A few said President Clinton and Treasury Secretary Robert
Rubin, in confidential asides, had given assurances that they would
pull $18 billion for the IMF out of Congress, an amount they have
requested.
</P>
<P>
   What was missing was a parting message: that in tough times a
strategy was emerging. ``What this whole thing is about is finding
a catalyst that will restore confidence,'' said John R.H. Bond, the
group chairman of HSBC Holdings PLC, whose Hong Kong and Shanghai
Bank has done business in Asia for a century. ``But in this crisis
there are so many players, so many different agendas, that turning
it around will be very, very difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Wednesday, Rubin suggested that anyone who
thought a meeting of 182 countries would come to hard and fast
conclusions did not have realistic expectations. ``It was never
going to come out with some highly momentous individual proposal,''
he insisted. ``The question was, would it energize international
action and a coalescence of views. And I think it unquestionably
did.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no magic wands,'' he added. ``These problems
developed over many years, and it will take time to work them
through.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin also made the case that there was now a consensus that
there needed to be ``some private sector involvement'' in packages
to aid affected countries _ financial code words meaning that big
banks, investment houses and hedge funds that help drive countries
to the brink ought to pay to clean up the mess.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest accomplishments, he said, was that ``everyone
came out of the G-7 meeting with a shared sense of concern.'' He
was referring to the huge gap between European and American views
of the severity of the global downturn.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of the Group of Seven leading industrial countries,
France and Germany in particular, argued until last week that
Clinton's repeated references to the ``greatest financial
challenges in a half-century'' were overdramatizing the problem.
</P>
<P>
   A senior European diplomat agreed with Rubin on Wednesday,
saying his delegation of officials and bankers had ``left a lot
more depressed than they arrived.''
</P>
<P>
   Finance ministers spent part of the week trying to assess the
president's political difficulties. Over breakfasts and lunches,
ministers would ask reporters to put away their notebooks and then
pepper them with questions about whether Clinton would survive the
impeachment inquiry that was gathering steam two miles away.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   France proposed giving developing countries and the European
Union more authority over the monetary fund, a plan that seemed to
be aimed at diminishing America's near domination of the
institution.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin politely dismissed the French plan with the suggestion
that it should be studied at length _ the longer the better, he
seemed to be saying _ but on Tuesday, Camdessus endorsed it, saying
he offered his ``full support of the French suggestion.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's suggestion on Friday that the IMF change its
strategy and develop a way to inoculate fundamentally healthy
countries from economic contagion with pre-emptive aid packages led
to public and private suggestions that it was time for Washington
to come up with more cash before offering ideas on how to spend it.
It seemed likely that Clinton's idea would eventually be accepted,
but a top official of the monetary fund, Jack Boorman, said
figuring out how it would work would take several months.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the other talk about creating a ``new international
financial architecture'' involved plans that most of those
attending said would require years to be enacted.
</P>
<P>
   The first may be new rules on what the financial community calls
``transparency'' _ requirements that countries divulge far more
information about their finances to investors, making it harder to
hide evidence of imminent economic disaster. Still, that is no
guarantee. Investors ignored a good deal of data about impending
trouble in Thailand and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   The other key suggestions to emerge from these meetings will
take even longer. Establishing rules for common financial
accounting rules and for renegotiating bad debts when countries and
their banks cannot pay may make sense, but they impinge on the
sovereignty of individual nations.
</P>
<P>
   Giving broader powers to the IMF to cajole, and sometimes order,
countries to lower their budget deficits or raise their taxes also
would impinge on their sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the basic dilemma of globalization,'' Papantoniou
said. ``Where do you draw the line between intervention and
nonintervention?''

DOLLAR OFF 8 PERCENT BUT YEN RALLY LACKS DEPTH 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The dollar plunged 8.1 percent against the Japanese yen on
Wednesday, its biggest one-day decline in 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   But this spectacular drop in the foreign-exchange market was not
triggered by a new belief among investors that Japan was on the
verge of turning its troubled economy around, traders and analysts
said. If that were the case, the fall of the dollar could be seen
as positive, as the end of the recession in Japan would help lead
the rest of Asia out of its slump.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the traders and analysts said, the selloff seemed to be
set off by a new rush of hedge funds and other investors to get out
of bets against the Japanese currency that had been very profitable
until two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Much of this selling reflects an unwillingness among hedge funds
and other investors to take much risk _ or stick with relatively
small losses for long _ in the current global financial crisis,
even if they think the dollar will rebound from this plunge.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this risk-averse environment, people are just getting
out,'' said Avinash Persaud, the global head of currency research
at J.P. Morgan Securities in London. ``All the people selling today
believe the dollar should go up against the yen, but they can't
tolerate the loss.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the selloff happened during the trading day in Europe,
rather than in Tokyo, where the yen got no boost even though the
government neared approval of a plan to rescue the country's
banking system and the stock market rallied.
</P>
<P>
   Traders and analysts said much of the selling was reinforced by
talk of major selling by two hedge funds _ Long-Term Capital
Management LP, which had to be rescued last month with an infusion
of $3.6 billion, and Tiger Management LLC, which is run by Julian
Robertson, a well-known hedge-fund manager.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Long-Term Capital denied that it was selling
dollars for yen. A spokesman for Tiger Management would not
comment. But it is generally known that Robertson has made major
bets that the yen would continue to weaken and that Japanese bank
stocks would fall. And traders said they did see Tiger selling on
Wednesday, as Japanese bank stocks rebounded and the yen rallied.
</P>
<P>
   Traders also said there was a lot of selling after the dollar
fell below 130 yen, 128 yen and 127 yen, levels where many
derivatives based on a dollar-yen trade forced selling. The recent
cut in interest rates by the Federal Reserve Board and the prospect
of more is also weighing on the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   In late trading in New York, the dollar cost 120.25 yen, down
from 130.85 yen Tuesday, its steepest one-day fall since 1973,
according to Bloomberg News. The dollar also fell against other
currencies, but not nearly as much. Against the German mark, the
dollar was down 1 percent to 1.6138 marks, from 1.63 marks Tuesday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While the dollar is off 18.3 percent against the yen since Aug.
11 and 11.7 percent against the mark since July 9, it had held up
well against other currencies, including the Mexican peso and the
Canadian dollar, currencies of two of the United States' largest
trading partners.
</P>
<P>
   But the trade-weighted dollar, which reflects the dollar's value
adjusted for the amount of trade with each country, dropped 2.3
percent Wednesday, according to the index kept by the Federal
Reserve Bank of Dallas, and is down 5.4 percent since Aug. 28.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that the aversion to taking even minimal risk in
the current financial climate _ in which investors are bringing
their money home and banks are less willing to make loans _ could
be the catalyst that slows the world economy even more and even
pushes the U.S. economy into a recession.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve,
said Wednesday that there was not a credit crunch, analysts and
economists are talking about it more every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no good reason to change our mind that the risks for
the global economy remain on the downside,'' John Lipsky, chief
economist at Chase Manhattan Bank, said.
</P>
<P>
   In less turbulent circumstances, the fall of the dollar could be
positive for the U.S. economy and for other countries. A weaker
dollar would make U.S. exports cheaper, helping reverse the sharp
slide in this sector since the demand from Asia dried up with the
economic crisis that erupted 15 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a weaker dollar could help make commodities more
attractive by lowering their price to consumers in the rest of the
world. Because most commodities are priced in dollars, a weaker
dollar makes them less expensive in other currencies. Stronger
commodity prices could help many of the world's troubled economies,
like Russia's, that are major exporters of commodities.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts are worried that the current slide of the dollar
will have little benefit if the U.S. economy is slowing sharply
and, in turn, makes things more difficult for other countries. In
this circumstance, demand for U.S. exports and commodities would be
likely to fall in a worldwide slowdown, even if a weaker dollar
makes them cheaper.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Red banners flapping in the breeze, Communists and
trade unionists led a nationwide strike Wednesday to protest
President Boris Yeltsin's rule.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, thousands of protesters marched toward the Kremlin
during a brilliantly sunny day to demand that Yeltsin resign. In
Vladivostok, the impoverished port city on Russia's Pacific Coast,
strikers briefly blocked a road.
</P>
<P>
   But the marches drew only a small fraction of the 10 million
demonstrators the Communists had expected. And while thousands of
factories and companies conducted short, symbolic work stoppages,
life basically went on as usual.
</P>
<P>
   The Moscow subway operated normally and stores were open for
business. Traffic was light, as many Moscovites took advantage of
the demonstrations to turn the day of national protest into a
holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's tepid protests were in stark contrast to the anxiety
early this week. Overheated rhetoric by Communist Party leaders
about ``civil war'' and the economic shocks of past weeks prompted
fears that this could be a difficult, even dangerous, week for the
Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   Braced for trouble, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov promised
earlier in the week to pay back wages. Moscow schools were closed
Wednesday as a security precaution. The American Chamber of
Commerce went so far as to warn foreigners to avoid the city center
and to disguise their nationality.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin also arranged for the marches to take place far from
the White House, the spot where tanks loyal to Yeltsin fired on the
rebellious Parliament in 1993, and an emotionally charged symbol
for the left.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Wednesday's protest march seemed more like a casual
city stroll than a parade of revolutionaries. The crowd, whose
members tended to be elderly, was made up of trade unionists,
workers and pensioners.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters gathered across the river from the Kremlin and
trudged peacefully toward St. Basil's Cathedral, while a
loudspeaker played revolutionary songs from the Russian Civil War,
like the ballad of Commander Shchors, a legendary Red Army
Commander.
</P>
<P>
   Holding a banner that read, ``No to Private Property,'' the
vanguard marched by billboards for Nescafe coffee, Renault cars,
Casio watches and Samsung televisions.
</P>
<P>
   At a rally near St. Basil's, there were fiery calls for Yeltsin
to quit, but no real expectation that he would actually do so.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the labor officials tried to turn the protest into a
campaign for Moscow's mayor, Yuri Luzhkov, who has sought to
position himself as the leader of a new center-left coalition in
the next presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   But they drew catcalls and boos from the hard-core Communists.
And after an hour or so of speech-making, most of the crowd drifted
away.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin, for his part, came to the Kremlin early Wednesday and
monitored the situation, telephoning security officials and militia
across the country. Yeltsin's spokesman said the president had
received ``absolutely complete information, both pleasant and
unpleasant.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's strikes, in fact, were as much a referendum on the
Communists' ability to tap the vein of national discontent as a
test of Yeltsin's dwindling popularity.
</P>
<P>
   The Communists had planned to mobilize some 200,000
demonstrators in Moscow, but the Kremlin insisted that no more than
50,000 turned out. The actual number seemed to be closer to the
lower end of the spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   Relatively low turnouts were also reported in other parts of the
nation. Police estimated that 70,000 had protested in the
Vladivostok region, not the 300,000 the Communists claimed.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin insisted that no more than 1 million participated in
the marches or strikes, one-tenth the number projected by the
Communists.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the Siberian region of Krasnoyarsk, Alexander Lebed, the
governor and presidential hopeful, egged on the protesters, telling
them that Yeltsin was alone and isolated.
</P>
<P>
   There are several reasons why Wednesday's protests were only a
pale reflection of what had been advertised. Primakov was able to
partially defuse the protest by promising to pay back wages and by
naming Communists to top positions in his Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Many Russians have also become deeply cynical about politics and
no longer have any expectation that the government will help them.
</P>
<P>
   When Russians were asked in a recent poll who they relied on in
a crisis, only 12 percent said they counted on the state. In
contrast, 61 percent said they rely ``only on myself,'' according
to the survey, which was conducted by the Center for International
Sociological Studies.
</P>
<P>
   Further, many Russians who are unhappy with Russia's version of
capitalism do not think that the Communist Party, which is led by
the uncharismatic Gennady Zuganov, is capable of leading the nation
out of its economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The national mood seemed to be captured during the recent
mayoral election in Vladivostok, where a majority voted against all
the candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's absurd to demonstrate now,'' said Vladimir Speransky, a
sociologist who said he came to watch the demonstration. ``It's not
clear whom to protest against.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the fringe groups had even less success than the
mainstream Communists in mobilizing their supporters. Viktor
Anpilov, the vituperative leader of the far-left faction Working
Russia, had expected to mobilize thousands of his supporters. But
no more than 300 showed up.
</P>
<P>
   The event also attracted the usual complement of Cossacks,
Monarchists and fascist extremists, who, by and large, mingled
peacefully with the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Still, dedicated Communists insisted the demonstrations were an
important way for Russians to show that they want Yeltsin to resign
and make way for a new president.
</P>
<P>
   Vasily Shishkaryov, a 48-year-old worker at the Zil truck
factory, said he joined the Moscow protest but many of his
coworkers stayed away.He said he only received 2,500 rubles a
month, about $156. Because prices have soared and imports have
dried up with the collapse of the ruble, he spends almost all of it
on food.
</P>
<P>
   Most of his fellow workers, he said, gathered potatoes and
vegetables in the countryside to scrape by. Some have virtually
given up eating meat since the factory's subsidized sausage store
shut down.
</P>
<P>
   Most of his fellow workers were more resigned than angry, and he
said that they would not be ready to take to the streets until
things got much worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got paid in August,'' he said. ``I don't think people will
take any real action until they have gone eight months without
wages.''

 CLINTON TO ANNOUNCE HELP AS HMOs LEAVE MEDICARE  
 (bl)  
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton plans to announce several steps
this week to help Medicare beneficiaries being dropped from health
maintenance organizations and is determined to halt the exodus of
HMOs from the program, White House officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said Clinton was surprised to learn that dozens of
HMOs were scaling back their Medicare operations, in part because
costs were higher and Medicare payments lower than they had
expected.
</P>
<P>
   The president's intervention represents a swift turnabout for
the administration, which initially played down the significance of
the HMO actions, saying they were mere business decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said they had underestimated the number
of HMOs that would withdraw from Medicare. HMOs are pulling out of
more than 300 counties in at least 22 states. The changes will
directly affect more than 400,000 people _ one out of every 15
beneficiaries now enrolled in HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   Patients dropped from HMOs often have to scramble to find new
doctors and arrange for new insurance, sometimes at a higher cost.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, alarm bells sounded on the political side of
the White House, and on Wednesday, Clinton aides said they feared a
backlash by tens of thousands of angry beneficiaries. Moreover,
White House officials said they were worried that other
beneficiaries would lose confidence in managed care organizations,
which were once thought to be the hope for the future of Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Clinton will announce what he describes as ``a
three-part initiative to respond to decisions by some HMOs to drop
out'' of Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   The president will encourage new HMOs to enter the counties from
which other health plans are departing, and he will order Medicare
officials to review the new applications as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   A White House memorandum says: ``The Health Care Financing
Administration will expedite its review and approval of HMOs
seeking to enter markets that have been left without a managed care
option. Any such applications will receive first priority for
review.''
</P>
<P>
   HMOs pulling out of a particular county will not be eligible for
this special treatment if they want to re-enter the market there.
But federal officials said they would make every effort to approve
applications from new HMOs by Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   This would allow beneficiaries to switch directly from one HMO
to another.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a White House official said Clinton would ask
Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala to prepare
legislation to ``make sure this never happens again.''
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of the legislation, according to the White House
memorandum, is to ``assure an adequate range of health plan options
for beneficiaries and reduce the likelihood that they will face
this kind of turmoil in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House will also begin a nationwide campaign to inform
people age 65 or older that if they are dropped from an HMO, they
can enroll in the original Medicare program, can buy private
insurance to fill gaps in Medicare and may not be denied such
Medigap coverage because of medical problems.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will criticize HMOs that drop out of Medicare, saying
they have abandoned their commitment to the elderly. He will also
reiterate the administration's refusal to let health plans raise
premiums or reduce benefits for Medicare patients, a matter over
which the administration refused last week to negotiate with HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Medicare should not and will not be held hostage to threats by
HMOs to leave the program,'' says a White House memorandum
summarizing what the president intends to say on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of Congress said their offices had been inundated
with calls from Medicare beneficiaries being dropped by HMOs. One
of those lawmakers, Sen. William Roth, R-Del., chairman of the
Finance Committee, said the Medicare agency's refusal to negotiate
with HMOs last week was ``shortsighted and highly regrettable.''
</P>
<P>
   HMOs pulling out of Medicare said that costs were higher than
expected and new federal rules more burdensome than expected,
pushing compliance costs higher.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare HMOs receive payments that vary widely, from a low of
$367 a month for a beneficiary in some rural counties to more than
$700 a month in Miami and parts of New York City, including
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Payments are computed according to a complex formula set by law.

 WASHINGTON: party unity.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the House vote neared, a prominent Senate Democrat took to
the floor of his chamber to warn the White House against meddling
on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would suggest by way of friendly advice to the White House:
Don't tamper with this jury,'' said Sen. Robert Byrd of West
Virginia, expressing his displeasure with White House efforts over
the weekend to convince 34 Democratic senators to sign a letter
saying they would not vote to convict the president, should he be
impeached.
</P>
<P>
   To his own colleagues, Byrd said: ``We may have to sit as
jurors. Don't let it be said that we allowed ourselves to be
tampered with.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton himself downplayed the idea that he was lobbying for his
survival. He said that while he was talking to House Democrats, ``a
large number called me. I'm attempting to call them all back and I
will try to do that.'' He said, ``More important than anything else
to me is that they do the people's work.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, demonstrating the turmoil in their ranks, had sharply
different views of what strategy was best for their party.
</P>
<P>
   While the leadership worked on the Democratic plan, Rep. James
Moran of Virginia, a moderate Democrat who has been in touch with
the White House, argued that it was better politically and
tactically for Democrats to vote with the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Such a stand, he argued, would give Democrats more credibility
eventually to vote against Clinton's impeachment. And he argued
that a partisan vote on Thursday would turn the November election
into a referendum on Clinton. ``If November 3 is a referendum on
the president's conduct, we lose,'' he said. ``The endgame for
Democrats is gaining control of the Congress and I don't think we
do that by playing on this field.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Democrats facing tough re-election bids worried that they
were facing what Rep. Calvin Dooley of California described as ``a
lose-lose vote here.'' He said he and colleagues feared that siding
with the Republicans would alienate base Democratic voters while
siding with the Republicans would drive away independent voters.
Dooley said that Clinton's advice to Democrats to vote their
conscience had done nothing to help with this dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Carolyn McCarthy, from a swing New York distirct on Long
Island said she would reluctantly vote for the Republican plan to
launch formal impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, this is probably going to be a no-win situation
for me back home, but the process has to go forward,'' Mrs.
McCarthy said. ``I'm not thrilled about how the Republicans have
made this open-ended, but I believe the process has to be moved
forward.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Eliot Engel, a New York City Democrat, said he strongly
opposed the Republicans' proposal. ``When I go back to my
district,'' he said, ``People are fed up with this. They say,
`Leave the president alone.' ''
</P>
<P>
   As the Democrats agonized, Republicans sat back and waited for
Thursday's vote. House Speaker Newt Gingrich said that Republican
leaders were not counting votes. ``There will be no arm-twisting,'
he said. ``Members need to take this vote as a matter of conscience
and we'll let the chips fall where they may tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, the two parties were still negotiating over
how much time would be alloted for the debate on opening an
impeachment inquiry. As a bargaining ploy, Democrats asked for
eight hours, while Republicans said they were hoping to hold the
debate to two or three hours.

RATHEON UPS CUTBACKS TO 16 PERCENT OF WORK FORCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOANN MULLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe

<P>
   Raytheon Co. says it will cut 5,300 more defense jobs on top of
8,700 already planned as it steps up &UR;  &LR; its effort to become more
competitive following its buyout last year of two big defense
rivals.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; In total, the Lexington-based defense electronics company
plans to eliminate 14,000 jobs, or 16 percent of its work force, by
the end of 1999 through a combination of layoffs and attibution.
That compares with an earlier target of 8,700 jobs, or 10 percent
of its work force, which was announced in January, shortly after
its acquisitions of the defense units of Hughes Electronics Corp.
and Texas Instruments Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is tough news for thousands of people. Let's not
sugar-coat it,'' said Raytheon's new president, Daniel P. Burnham,
who is scheduled to succeed chief executive officer Dennis J.
Picard in December.
</P>
<P>
   But he said by aggressively cutting expenses, Raytheon can bid
more competitively and win more new business. That will be better
in the long run for shareholders, customers and the company's
remaining 115,000 employees, Burnham said.
</P>
<P>
   Burnham, a former Allied-Signal Co. executive who has been on
the job at Raytheon for only 100 days, emphasized that the
company's growth potential is strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not doing this because the markets aren't growing. We're
doing it because we need to be competitive to win.'' He added that
Raytheon _ the nation's third-largest defense company, behind
Lockheed Martin Corp. and Boeing Co. _ is winning a record 75
percent of the programs it bids on.
</P>
<P>
   The defense industry has been consolidating in recent years as
government buying dried up with the end of the cold war.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts, which had been spared the brunt of the cutbacks
in Raytheon's first round of layoffs, was nicked a bit harder this
time.
</P>
<P>
   A total of about 1,200 jobs will be eliminated in Massachusetts,
up from an earlier target of 300 mostly administrative positions.
Some 900 will be through layoffs, 300 through attrition. About
1,000 of the job cuts will come this year, with the remainder
occuring in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those laid off will be manufacturing workers &UR;  &LR; at
Raytheon's Waltham West plant, which will be closed. Although the
work will be transferred to Raytheon's Andover and Tewskbury
facilities, not all of the 1,000 employees in Waltham will get to
move, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The remainder of the cuts in Massachusetts will occur at
Raytheon facilities scattered throughout greater Boston.
</P>
<P>
   But there is also new work moving to New England as a result of
Wednesday's announcements. Some work now done at plants scheduled
to close in Texas and South Carolina will be shifted to Andover,
although the job impact is minimal. Also, work done at a plant in
Washington will be shifted to Raytheon's Portsmouth, R.I., plant.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon will also close several other plants in Texas and
California.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to accelerating the cost reductions within its
defense arm, known as Raytheon Systems Co., Raytheon also said
Wednesday that its Engineers &AMP; Constructors unit continues to
struggle.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly as a result of slowing demand overseas for big
construction projects, Raytheon said its third-quarter earnings,
before one-time charges, would fall short of analysts' expectations
of 90 cents a share. For the fourth quarter, however, Raytheon is
still on track to earn about $1.08 per share, the company said. The
announcement came after the stock market closed.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Raytheon stock closed at $58, up 1 3/4.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon also said its third quarter results, which will be
announced Oct. 20, will include several non-recurring charges
totaling $284 million, or 83 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   The charges include $50 million for additional downsizing of its
engineering unit and a $180 million adjustment in the amount set
aside for lost engineering business. The downsizing in the
engineering unit involves facilities and does not include job cuts
beyond the 1,000 in the engineering and construction unit &UR;  &LR; that
were announced separately last January.
</P>
<P>
   ``Raytheon Engineers &AMP; Constructors is well on its way to
correcting its problems,'' said Burnham, citing new management,
stricter cost controls and shared risks through partnerships.
</P>
<P>
   The financial turmoil in Asia has also taken a toll on
Raytheon's commercial electronics business. The company said it
would take a $54 million charge to exit a Korean joint venture &UR;  &LR; in
commercial electronics.

PIPPIG WILL APPEAL ON FAILED DRUG TEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Uta Pippig, whose three straight Boston Marathon
victories made her one of the most revered female athletes in the
city's history, was suspended from competition Wednesday after
failing a drug test.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement was made by the German Athletics Association,
which said a random, out-of-competition test on Pippig April 23 in
Boulder, Colo., where she lives and trains much of the year, showed
an abnormal ratio of testosterone to epitestosterone.
</P>
<P>
   If a review by the federation's legal panel finds Pippig guilty
of taking an illegal substance, she could be banned from worldwide
competition for two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have 100 percent confidence that she's innocent,'' said Tom
Ratcliffe, Pippig's agent.
</P>
<P>
   Pippig was not available for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The 33-year-old marathoner known for blowing kisses to the crowd
has been a Boston favorite since 1990, when she finished second to
Rosa Mota in her first race in this country after leaving her
native East Germany. In 1994, she won her first Boston after
shrugging off a bad cold; she repeated in 1995 and solidified her
place in Boston lore the next year when she overcame severe
menstrual cramps, bleeding, and diarrhea for her third consecutive
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Since women were officially allowed to compete at Boston for the
first time in 1972, Pippig is the only woman to win three in a row.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, trying to come back from injuries sustained in the 1996
Olympic marathon, from which she dropped out late in the race,
Pippig was fourth here, her lowest Boston finish in seven
appearances. She did not compete this past April after deciding to
take some time off from marathoning to concentrate on shorter races
but was in town to do television commentary. She recently finished
eighth in the Falmouth Road Race.
</P>
<P>
   Guy Morse, race director of the Boston Marathon, said Wednesday
that post-race drug testing is mandatory for all runners who finish
in the top three at Boston and that Pippig never tested positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what makes this even more unbelievable to hear, because
our history with her has been perfect,'' said Morse. ``Like a lot
of people, I guess, I was shocked.''
</P>
<P>
   But Morse went on to emphasize that the findings so far are
inconclusive. ``What bothers me about this process, and it's
happened before, is that the drug testing process is an imperfect
one at best,'' he said. ``She's somewhere in the process of
review.''
</P>
<P>
   Pippig's case appears to resemble that of Mary Slaney, the
middle-distance runner who was suspended after a drug test at the
1996 US Olympic trials showed similar results. Slaney has since
been cleared by USA Track &AMP; Field and is free to compete but still
awaits an arbitration hearing by the International Amateur Athletic
Federation, the sport's governing body.
</P>
<P>
   The accepted ratio of testosterone, the male sex hormone, to
epitestosterone, which has no known function, is 6-1; anything
above that t/e ratio is considered to indicate the possible use of
testosterone as a performance-enhancing anabolic steroid.
</P>
<P>
   However, about one in 2,000 people have a naturally higher
ratio, and because most research has been conducted on men, the
reliability of using the ratio as a barometer of drug use in women
has come into question.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ratio as a test has problems,'' said Dr. Gary I. Wadler,
an associate professor of medicine at New York University School of
Medicine and lead author of the textbook ``Drugs and the Athlete.''
Among other factors, he said, ``The menstrual cycle may influence
t/e ratios.''
</P>
<P>
   In drug tests of urine, two samples are always taken. According
to a statement by the German federation, Pippig's A and B samples
both showed an abnormal t/e ratio. In addition to the routine
testing, Pippig's B sample was reportedly subjected to a carbon
isotope test that, although relatively new, is thought to be more
reliable because it is purported to distinguish between
testosterone that is natural and testosterone that is introduced
into the body. Therefore, issues such as the menstrual cycle or use
of birth control would be mitigated.
</P>
<P>
   In a Runner's World magazine story in 1991, Pippig acknowledged
that she had briefly used performance-enhancing substances while
competing for the former East Germany in the 1980s. In interviews
since then, however, she and her coach/companion, Dieter Hogen,
have stressed their devotion to natural competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mary (Slaney) was exonerated, and I have confidence Uta will
be also,'' said Ratcliffe. ``But once she is tainted with this,
it's hard to dispel.''

FAME FORCES CANCER TO GO PUBLIC  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By JENNIFER STEINHAUER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Last Friday, after Darryl Strawberry's doctors
confirmed that the pains in his stomach were a result of a
cancerous tumor in his colon, the phones starting ringing at Dr.
Alice Furman's office.
</P>
<P>
   People with stomachaches, people who saw little spots of blood
when they went to the bathroom, people in their 30s who were at
almost no risk for colon cancer _ all wanted referrals for colon
exams, immediately. ``There was a rash of calls,'' said Dr. Furman,
an internist in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   At the office of Dr. William Perlow, a gastroenterologist, the
story was much the same. ``Just today before I sat down in my
chair, my secretary told me 10 patients have booked for
colonoscopy,'' Perlow said, referring to the test used to determine
cancer in the colon. ``That is much larger than usual.''
</P>
<P>
   Although colon cancer is the second-biggest killer among cancers
in America, it is hardly the most talked about. The disease lacks
breast cancer's pink ribbon pins and ovarian cancer's glitzy
benefits, like the one recently held by Saks Fifth Avenue with
Elizabeth Tilberis, the editor in chief of Harper's Bazaar, who has
suffered from that disease.
</P>
<P>
   And the area of the body colon cancer affects does not help its
profile. Although it can be successfully treated if detected early,
many people will not submit to the uncomfortable _ and what many
see as embarrassing _ screening tests.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry, an outfielder for the New York Yankees, is hardly
the classic colon cancer patient. At age 36 and with no family
history of the illness, he is in a small group. Most of those
afflicted are over 50. But the rush to the phones after his cancer
was diagnosed underscores the pivotal role a celebrity name can
play in the public awareness and even early detection of
potentially terminal diseases.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a celebrity gets a cancer that is generally not talked
about that much,'' said Joann Schellenbach, a spokeswoman for the
American Cancer Society, ``people do get motivated to do something
about it. So you try to use these situations as best you can.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Schellenbach traced the role of famous people to Betty Ford,
whose 1974 announcement about her breast cancer _ and candid talk
about a subject previously seen as taboo _ sent women racing for
mammograms, and sent the rate of breast cancer detection up that
year. ``She was one of the first celebrities to talk about her
situation,'' Ms. Schellenbach said. ``She set the stage for a whole
different public awareness about cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, many famous people have by proxy raised awareness of
serious illnesses: some simply because they were so high-profile,
like President Ronald Reagan, who was found to have colon cancer
and who underwent successful surgery in 1985; others, like Ms.
Tilberis, because of concerted efforts to raise awareness of a
disease.
</P>
<P>
   But Reagan demonstrates how much public discourse on illness has
changed in just a decade. When his colon cancer was diagnosed, he
tried to maintain his privacy. But when his Alzheimer's disease was
diagnosed in 1994, he released an open letter to the American
public, and his wife, Nancy, has been an active and prolific voice
on the issue with her own foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Other celebrities who have lent their names and faces to
illnesses in recent years include Peggy Fleming, the skater, who
survived breast cancer; Magic Johnson, the basketball player, who
has been open about having HIV, and Michael Landon, the actor, who
appeared on the ``Tonight'' show in 1991 to talk about his battle
with liver and pancreatic cancer. Landon died later that year at
age 54.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Strawberry's case has also been somewhat extraordinary. While
many athletes who are told they have a serious illness would most
likely let a team's press release tell their story, Strawberry held
a news conference on his front lawn, and broke down in tears on
national television.
</P>
<P>
   His plight was intensified both by his long and public battle
with drugs and alcohol, and by the fact that his friend and fellow
baseball player, Eric Davis of the Baltimore Orioles, suffered
colon cancer just a year ago at age 35.
</P>
<P>
   While colon cancer is rare among men and women their age, it is
second only to lung cancer among those cancers that kill Americans.
About 131,600 cases of colon cancer will be diagnosed this year,
according to American Cancer Society figures. What has frustrated
doctors about the illness is that unlike many other forms of
cancer, it is easily detected with early screening and therefore
more treatable. But screening for colon cancer happens far less
often than it should, medical experts say.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons are many, said Dr. Michael Choti, director of the
Johns Hopkins colon cancer center in Baltimore. ``There is a fear
factor,'' he said, referring to the instrument doctors use in
peering into the colon, ``because it is one thing to get a
mammogram or blood test, but the public fears that a sigmoidoscopy
is uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other factor is that the public is not aware. If I were to
ask you what the American Cancer Society recommends for breast
cancer, you would probably know, but you wouldn't for colon
cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   Recommendations by the American Cancer Society for colon cancer
screening vary. If there is a family history of the disease, the
recommendation is for relatives to have a colonoscopy 10 years
before the stricken family member's age at diagnosis, or by age 40.
Those with no family history and no previous cancers _ roughly 75
percent of the population _ are advised to have a colonoscopy at
age 50 and every 10 years after. Precancerous polyps are easily
detected though this method and can be removed in a doctor's
office.
</P>
<P>
   If colon cancer is caught at a relatively early stage, the
five-year survival rate is 92 percent, according to American Cancer
Society statistics.

   KAPELL-MUSIC (Undated) _ By the time William Kapell died in a
plane crash in October 1953, at 31, he had already come to be
recognized as the finest pianist America had produced. The popular
pianists at the time were foreign-born: Horowitz, Rubinstein,
Brailowsky, Hofmann. As an artist he was stupefyingly gifted, and
everyone knew it. By his mid-20s he had a major career, a contract
with RCA Victor, dates with Ormandy, Stokowski, Reiner, Monteux and
Steinberg. His recording of Khachaturian's Concerto with
Koussevitzky became a jukebox hit. Then he died, and as often
happens, the fame faded. His recordings went out of print by 1960,
and after that only a few were available occasionally. Pianists
still talked of him as an icon who had paved the way for the first
generation of Americans to make a mark on the international scene.

   ZONCA-FILMS (Paris) _ Erick Zonca, 42, the French movie
director, first film ``The Dreamlife of Angels,'' closes the New
York Film Festival on Sunday. It is, so to speak,
post-autobiographical. Nonetheless, it is a first film in that it
came out of nowhere: even in the French movie business, few people
had heard of Erick Zonca. Until, that is, ``The Dreamlife of
Angels'' was given a 12-minute ovation at this year's Cannes

   APPALACHIAN-SPRING-DANCE (Denver) _ As he waited for curtain
calls at the gala closing of the old Metropolitan Opera House in
1966, Martin Fredmann, 23, then a dancer with the Metropolitan
Opera Ballet, felt a pinch on his bottom. He turned to discover
Martha Graham. She gave him a big wink. It was the only time
Fredmann met Graham. Now artistic director of Colorado Ballet in
Denver, he could probably use another pinch and wink. The
improbable irony of the intervening years is that Fredmann, whose
background is in classical ballet, is a lynch pin in an experiment
that might give Graham's modern-dance repertory a more secure lease
on life. Next weekend Colorado Ballet presents the first major

   RIDGE-THEATER (New York) _ The Ridge Theater is an avant-garde
company with the unbuttoned charm of ex-hippies who have made a
name in experimental theater for staging multimedia spectacles with
tidy, Swiss-watch precision. ``Looking at us, you'd think we're
aging slackers,'' says Bob McGrath, 43, the group's artistic
director. Finding order in ``Chaos,'' a new opera the Ridge is
staging at the Kitchen, through Oct. 24, seems a suitable task for
the company, which for 11 years has favored stories that accent the
sinister side of popular culture. By Steven Drukman. (Moved).

   DAVIS-THEATER-ARTIST (Undated) _ In Paul Davis's theater
posters, one can see the essence of the original performance: the
arrogant charm of Raul Julia's Mack the Knife in ``Threepenny
Opera,'' Sam Waterston crying out his rage in ``Hamlet,'' the
Orientalized elegance of Irene Worth in ``The Cherry Orchard'' and
the full range of Kevin Kline's virtuosity as Hamlet, Richard III
and the Pirate King in ``The Pirates of Penzance. As an artist,
Davis made his reputation with these posters and others he drew for
Joseph Papp during the heyday of the New York Shakespeare Festival
in the 1970s and 1980s. By Mel Gussow. (Moved).

   HUNTER-HENLEY-THEATER (Undated) _ If Holly Hunter and Beth
Henley had not been stuck in an elevator together 16 years ago on
their way to an audition for Ms. Henley's play ``The Wake of Jamey

   CLASSICAL MUSIC
</P>
<P>
   MUSIC-PUBLISH (Undated) _ Historically, getting a musical
composition published was more than a practical way of putting a
new score into circulation. It was a tangible sign that a composer
had arrived on the scene and was to be taken seriously. That
situation has changed. The music publishing business was already in
crisis some 15 years ago, when personal computer programs enabled
composers to create manuscripts as attractive and legible as
engraved published scores. Now that such programs have become less
complicated and more flexible, the computer-generated score is the
standard. By Anthony Tommasini. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   BEETHOVEN-MUSIC (Undated) _ Playing Beethoven is one of the two
most important things a symphony orchestra has to do, along with
performing new works. We need to keep going back to Beethoven. And
we need to keep thinking about why we need to keep going back.
Opportunities to go back, but not so much to think about why, were
recently offered by the New York Philharmonic and its music
director, Kurt Masur. Their season-opening Beethoven cycle was,
remarkably, the Philharmonic's first compact presentation of the
Beethoven symphonies since Toscanini conducted the works in the
orchestra's centenary year, 1942. A lot has happened since 1942.
Increased knowledge of Beethoven's contemporaries has enhanced our
awareness both of how far he stood apart and of how close he was to
other composers of his age in his Romantic urgings and his
revolutionary hopes. By Paul Griffiths. (Moved).

   POP MUSIC
</P>
<P>
   DYLAN-1966-MUSIC (Undated) _ Things got ugly when Bob Dylan
performed on May 17, 1966, at the Free Trade Hall in Manchester,
England. A good part of the audience was actively hostile to
Dylan's non-protest songs and his bluesy electric band: catcalling,
shouting insults, clapping in an attempt to drown out the music. It
was all duly recorded by Columbia Records, which finally releases
Dylan's ``Live 1966'' (two CDs) this week. By Jon Pareles. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   BETTY-CARTER-APPRAISAL (Undated) _ Jazz singer, composer,
arranger nonpareil _ Betty Carter, who died on Sept. 26 at the age

   APPLE-BERLIN-ARTS (Berlin) _ Reunification has reshuffled the
artistic deck in Berlin. The scaffolding surrounding the great
Pergamon Altar, a masterpiece of Hellenistic art from the 2nd
century B.C., has come down. One of the main attractions on the
Museum Island, where other museums are also under repair, it
reopened to the public in August, cleaned and restored, though work
remains to be done. The big event of the summer was the opening in
June of the new Gemaldegalerie, or picture gallery, where the

   CALLOWAY-BEARSLEY-ART (London) _ In the grand tradition of
English eccentrics, Stephen Calloway, 47, has made his passion for
the past into a way of life so convincingly anachronistic that an
afternoon spent with him discussing his most recent project seems
like a step back into the vanished world he has been obsessed with
since he was a child. An associate curator of drawings and prints
at the Victoria and Albert Museum, he organized the Aubrey
Beardsley retrospective that opened there Thursday, to mark the
centenary of the artist's death. The exhibition of more than 200
works, most drawn from the museum's extensive Beardsley holdings,

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Louise Slaughter has not been a big fan of her
fellow Democrat Bill Clinton. She thinks that he was a major reason
the Democrats lost control of Congress in 1994, that he has struck
one too many deals with the Republicans, and that his behavior has
been reckless and abhorrent. Two months ago, she was on the verge
of urging him to resign.
</P>
<P>
   But as the House prepares to vote on whether to open an
impeachment inquiry into the president, Ms. Slaughter, from
Rochester, N.Y., finds herself deeply torn. As much as she would
not mind seeing Bill Clinton out of office, she worries that
Congress is about to start down a path the Founding Fathers never
envisioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not interested in what happens to Bill Clinton,'' she
said. ``It's the country and the Constitution I'm concerned
about.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim Maloney, D-Conn., is in a different bind. He is locked
in one of the toughest races of any House member, against a
challenger who has made Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky a
major campaign issue. Yet Maloney also believes that the majority
of his constituents are fed up with demeaning investigations into
the president.
</P>
<P>
   So while the freshman congressman could support a limited
investigation, he remains painfully uncertain about how to vote on
what may be the only alternative available to him: a Republican
plan that would allow an open-ended inquiry that he fears could
drag on for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we do that, we'll just be opening the door to the partisan
mischief that has been going on for so long around this place,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Across Capitol Hill on Wednesday, the fence sitters in
Washington's impeachment debate were consulting constitutional
scholars, meeting with colleagues and spouses, rereading the
Federalist Papers and studying their political tea leaves,
searching for any inspiration that could help tip their mental
scales one way or the other.
</P>
<P>
   Most were preparing to follow party lines, but among that
dwindling group of undecideds are two large groups of Democrats
facing different pressures.
</P>
<P>
   On one side are people like Ms. Slaughter, who have become
deeply disaffected with Clinton, and who believe he has done little
to advance the congressional Democrats' agenda and now feel
hesitant about helping him out of his bind.
</P>
<P>
   On the other are people like Maloney, who are locked in tough
re-election fights and who are concerned that appearing soft on
Clinton will infuriate swing voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``What will I do before I decide?'' asked Rep. Bill Pascrell
Jr., D-N.J., who is also among the fence sitters. ``I'll pray. And
then I'll move on.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In an interview in her Capitol Hill office, Ms. Slaughter said
Clinton would not be a factor in her decision. ``He happens to be
occupying the important spot there, and I want to do what I can to
preserve the presidency,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But she recalled with evident disgust a phone call in August
from a White House official who was looking for ``Senator
Slaughter'' and who expressed surprise that she had an office in
Rochester. ``That's how far down the list I am, I guess,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   She also said Clinton's poor relations with congressional
Democrats had hurt the party's congressional candidates in 1996 and
1994. ``He didn't say this, but Dick Morris said it for him: Bill
Clinton didn't care who ran for Congress,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Slaughter said she was prepared in August to call on Clinton
to resign, but backed away after seeing his videotaped performance
for the grand jury. ``I thought his rights were, frankly, abridged
terribly,'' she said. ``No other human being in the United States
would have been subjected to that.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, Ms. Slaughter said, she had been speaking to
constitutional scholars about impeachment precedents, and meeting
with small groups of colleagues from both parties who remain
undecided. At this moment, she is leaning toward voting against an
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not trying to get by an election, or get by a hard spot
here,'' she said. ``What we do here has ramifications far beyond
our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Maloney said he had been studying the report of the Whitewater
independent counsel, Kenneth Starr, reviewing Clinton's rebuttals
and videotaped testimony, talking with friends on the House
Judiciary Committee and trying to listen to constituents. The
latter group, he says, falls into three equal subgroups: those who
want the matter dropped, those who want Clinton impeached, and
those who want some lesser punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Maloney, a former state senator, represents a western
Connecticut district that was held by Republicans for many years,
including Gov. John Rowland, until Maloney wrested it from Rep.
Gary Franks in the Clinton landslide of 1996. Since then, Maloney
has tiptoed across party lines on many occasions, including to
support a Republican tax-cut plan this year.
</P>
<P>
   Maloney's Republican opponent, state Sen. Mark Nielsen, has
called on Clinton to resign, and said Wednesday that he would make
it an issue if Maloney votes against an impeachment inquiry. ``The
Congress can't turn a blind eye to President Clinton's
criminality,'' he said. ``And the congressman from the 5th District
can't be a part of the Clinton defense strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   Maloney contends that such talk only turns voters off and that a
more thoughtful approach is what will sell in November. ``I have
said this doesn't belong in politics,'' he said. ``I read the
Constitution in a given way. It isn't anything goes.''
</P>
<P>
   Maloney said he would support a six-month inquiry with
well-defined parameters, which could include the Lewinsky matter
and any other matters referred by the independent counsel. If the
House can agree to such a bipartisan plan, Maloney said, his
decision on Thursday will be easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's not what I'm expecting,'' he said.

CLINTON APPEALS TO CONSCIENCE OF LAWMAKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER AND BRIAN MCGRORY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With no hope of preventing a formal impeachment
inquiry, President Clinton issued a last-minute appeal for House
members to cast ``a vote of principle and conscience'' today on
whether to launch the historic proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers, bracing for what many declared the most momentous
vote of their careers, said they would honor Clinton's plea, but
warned that he could be disappointed by the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   By many accounts, a Republican plan for a wide-ranging,
open-ended inquiry is expected to pass the House today with support
from nearly 275 or more of the chamber's 435 members, including a
sizable number of Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   But even as Clinton expressed resignation at the bleakness of
his situation, Vice President Al Gore, Hillary Rodham Clinton and
House Democratic leaders joined him in a final, low-key effort to
contain the damage by swaying as many Democrats as possible to snub
the GOP plan in favor of a Democratic proposal for a narrower
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   In either case, Clinton would be the first president since
Richard M. Nixon in 1974 and second since Andrew Johnson in 1868 to
be subjected to an impeachment ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's up to others to decide what happens to me,'' Clinton told
reporters in the Oval Office, ``and ultimately it's going to be up
to the American people to make a clear statement there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican impeachment plan calls for the House Judiciary
Committee to investigate Clinton on charges of perjury, witness
tampering and obstruction of justice stemming from his liaisons in
the Oval Office with former White House intern Monica S. Lewinsky.
The proposal also would permit the panel to examine other matters,
such as the alleged misuse of confidential FBI files by White House
political operatives.
</P>
<P>
   The committee would be bound by no deadline, although the
chairman, Representative Henry J. Hyde of Illinois, has said he
hopes to complete the inquiry by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic alternative would set Dec. 31 as a formal
deadline. It also would limit the inquiry's scope to the Lewinsky
matter, and the Judiciary Committee could open a full investigation
of the scandal only if it first determined the allegations
constitute legitimate grounds for impeachment if they are proven.
</P>
<P>
   While the 228 House Republicans were virtually unified behind
the GOP impeachment plan, their 206 Democratic counterparts
remained in some turmoil. Most House Democrats are poised to oppose
the GOP plan, but at least 40 to 50 moderates and conservatives are
expected to break party ranks. And a dozen or more liberals plan to
vote against both measures because they believe Clinton's actions
do not warrant impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   All 10 House Democrats from Massachusetts plan to support the
Democratic alternative for impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly every House member, however, the vote carries
potential consequences both for the November elections and the
lawmaker's legacy. A generation after Nixon's resignation, for
example, historians are still scrutinizing the actions of House
members who participated in the impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are wrestling with what is the right way to do this,''
said the House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri,
after a fractious meeting of House Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   One of the leading Democratic defectors, Representative James P.
Moran of Virginia, expressed concern as he nervously approached the
landmark vote. A longtime Clinton ally, Moran said he will break
ranks and support the Republican-sponsored impeachment inquiry
because he believes it will be in the best interest of the
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``The endgame for Democrats should be regaining control of the
House,'' said Moran, a moderate from a district in northern
Virginia. ``But if the November elections are a referendum on the
president's conduct, we lose. And there is a high likelihood they
could become a referendum if we all vote as a bloc against the
inquiry.''
</P>
<P>
   Moran added, ``I'm concerned, because if you get too out of step
with your constituency, you might have to look for another
career.''
</P>
<P>
   In another setback for the White House, Representative Tim
Roemer, a moderate Democrat from a swing district in Indiana, said
he will vote for the Republican plan because he believes Clinton's
conduct warrants a full investigation to determine whether it was
``very reckless, immoral and private behavior, or a threat to the
Constitution and therefor an impeachable offense.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This cannot be a vote to protect the president of your own
party,'' Roemer said. ``It has to be a vote that serves your
country and your conscience.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's strongest supporters are liberals such as
Represenative Jose E. Serrano, a New York Democrat who was
re-elected in 1996 with 97 percent of the vote in his
overwhelmingly black and Hispanic district. ``My constituents are
angry, and they are saying, `Drop all of this now, or we are coming
after you,' '' Serrano said. ``I've never heard my constituents
talk to me like that.''
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, officials said publicly and privately there
was no war room on the eve of the vote, no aggressive campaign to
influence Democratic members.
</P>
<P>
   One senior White House official said aides have retreated from
any significant lobbying effort out of the realization that they
could not win and the hope that a Republican victory will prove not
only hollow, but self-destructive.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Clinton and his wife
were not offering any incentive _ fund-raising help, for example _
to sway undecided members to vote against the Republican proposal.
``We believe it is not proper for us, despite what others may
report about what we're doing, to aggressively try to impact or
lobby people on this,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Clinton, at a morning photo opportunity with the prime
minister of Hungary, said he had already returned, or planned to,
what he described as ``a large number of calls from House
members.'' Later in the day, Lockhart placed that number at ``a
handful.''
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton spoke publicly, behind the scenes, Mrs. Clinton
rejected overtures from a group of freshmen Democrats who wanted
the president to publicly acknowledge that the House would approve
the Republican plan and to effectively release Democrats to cross
party lines, according to officials familiar with the meeting. The
appeal came in a meeting on the legislative agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was some interchange about other ideas the White House
could pursue about the vote, like acknowledging this would pass and
getting in front of it and geting this over with,'' said an
official.
</P>
<P>
   Such an approach, though, was flatly rejected. ``She made clear
she thought the Democratic alternative that puts the standards
first was the right way to proceed,'' said Marsha Berry, Mrs.
Clinton's spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, White House aides called key Hill Democrats with a
fresh batch of poll numbers that show public disapproval for a
lengthy hearing. ``Everyone is calling old friends,'' said Lynn
Cutler, a deputy director of intergovernmental affairs at the White
House. ``We're all doing that. I don't think that's such an
astounding thing. No one's muscling anyone. More of the calls are
asking `Where is your head at, what are you thinking about, could
you support the Democratic alternative?'''
</P>
<P>
   As for the White House seeking support in the Senate, the
president received some ``friendly advice'' from Senator Robert C.
Byrd, a West Virginia Democrat: ``Don't tamper with this jury.'' If
the House recommends Clinton's impeachment, the Senate would sit as
the jury in an impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Democrats on the Judiciary Committee were touting the
merits of the Democratic alternative to their colleagues.
Representative William D. Delahunt of Massachusetts sent a letter
to House members pushing for the alternative, which he said
protected Clinton's constitutional rights by calling for a
preliminary inquiry of the charges lodged by the independent
counsel, Kenneth W. Starr, before the Judiciary Committee proceeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we shirk that duty, we will have turned the Independent
Counsel Statute into a political weapon with an automatic trigger,
a weapon aimed at every future president,'' Delahunt wrote.
</P>
<P>
   A skirmish also broke out Wednesday over the procedures
surrounding today's votes. Because the GOP plan is a privileged
resolution, House rules call for debate over the measure to be
limited to an hour. And the rules provide no time to debate the
Democratic alternative, which will be voted on as a motion to send
the GOP plan back to the Judiciary Committee with instructions to
adopt the guidelines in the Democratic plan.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Martin T. Meehan, a Massachusetts Democrat who
serves on the Judiciary Committee, called the one-hour debate limit
``unconscionable,'' ``inexcusable'' and ``indefensible'' for a
matter of such import.
</P>
<P>
   He called on Republican leaders ``to come to their senses'' and
extend the debate. ``We have to do something to bring some sanity
to this process,'' Meehan said.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Stratman, a spokesman for Hyde, said Republican leaders
would agree to extend the debate to ``a reasonable length,'' such
as three or four hours. However, the deal would require unanimous
approval from all 435 House members.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Starr responded to an inquiry from the Judiciary Committee
Wednesday by informing the panel he continues to investigate
matters involving Clinton unrelated to Lewinsky. He did not rule
out forwarding the commmittee additional allegations, which could
lead to an expansion of the impeachment inquiry under GOP plan.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The greatest home run hitter in major league history
tipped his cap Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Aaron, now a senior vice president for the Atlanta Braves,
had nothing but praise for Mark McGwire of the St. Louis Cardinals
and Sammy Sosa of the Chicago Cubs, who staged the home run derby
of the century, hitting 70 and 66, respectively, as they shattered
Roger Maris's 37-year-old record of 61. Aaron also applauded the
man they beat and urged Maris's selection for the Baseball Hall of
Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they keep hitting 70 home runs in a season,'' said Aaron,
who holds the career record of 755, ``they're going to catch me in
a hurry. In fact, they're going to catch a lot of people. To me,
one of the greatest things ever to happen was just to have this
home run derby. I didn't have a favorite. I just knew it was good
for baseball. As far as I'm concerned, the best man won.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have a commissioner, and the derby put that on the
back page as well as the things that were happening in Washington.
Baseball did a lot to get people to think positive about
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Aaron, who hit his career high of 47 homer for the Braves in
1970, said that in his opinion, expansion was a huge factor in the
big individual numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an expansion season, things can work against you,'' he
said. ``Pitching is going to be thin. But for somebody to have 60,
65, 70 home runs, no matter if it's thin or not, means the hitter
had a very good season. I hadn't noticed it, but Duke Snider told
me the baseball that was used this year was wound very tight. You
had guys hitting home runs who really weren't supposed to be
capable of hitting home runs. I can't say that's the reason. I
don't have to face the pitchers.''
</P>
<P>
   Aaron said that if he were a member of the Hall of Fame Veterans
Committee, he would vote for Maris.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roger Maris was a very good ballplayer,'' he said. ``Almost
everywhere he went, the teams he played for won championships (the
Yankees and St. Louis). I know he had only one great year and you
have to go beyond that. If I was voting, I would have to say, yes,
he belongs in the Hall of Fame.''
</P>
<P>
   Aaron said McGwire, who has 457 home runs, is a long shot to
break his record. The Cardinals star, now 34, lost several prime
years to injuries. Aaron thinks his main challenger will be Ken
Griffey of Seattle, who hit 56 homers this year and has 350 for his
career.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a possibility that the kid can do it if he stays
focused and healthy,'' said Aaron. ``He's hit over 50 the last two
seasons. I set my record and never hit more than 47. He's very good
and plays in a good home run park. I think he has an excellent
chance of hitting a lot of home runs.''

CLINTON'S AIDES AND GOP TRY TO RESOLVE BUDGET ISSUES 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With three days until temporary financing of the
government expires, Republican leaders met Wednesday night with
White House officials in their first high-level attempt to resolve
dozens of spending issues and avoid a government shutdown.
</P>
<P>
   The unresolved issues include financing for the International
Monetary Fund, how to conduct the 2000 census, and billions of
dollars in extra spending for items that the administration deems
emergencies, like the peacekeeping mission in Bosnia, the year 2000
computer bug, and disaster relief for farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Speaker Newt Gingrich, Sen. Trent Lott and Rep. Dick Armey, the
majority leader, were hashing out the details behind closed doors
in the speaker's office with Erskine Bowles, President Clinton's
chief of staff, John Podesta, the deputy chief of staff, and
Lawrence Stein, the administration's liaison with Congress.
</P>
<P>
   During a dinner break, Bowles expressed some confidence that
both sides could reach agreement but said they would be working all
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we made some reasonable progress, in general,'' he
said, adding, ``I think we've got a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said that no specific issues had been resolved and
suggested none would be until both sides could define the entire
scope of what they wanted. ``Nothing is resolved until everything
is resolved,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Republican leaders were trying to smooth
over differences in their own ranks to speed the process along.
Over the squawking of both moderates and conservatives, House
leaders stripped out four controversial provisions from the
nettlesome bill that finances the Treasury Department and the
Postal Service.
</P>
<P>
   The provisions sought to weaken the Federal Election Commission,
required the government, to provide health insurance coverage for
contraceptives for female federal workers, to block amnesty for
40,000 Haitians living in the United States and to set federal
standards for child care.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, so many House members were so upset with these
provisions that they blocked the bill from being debated on the
House floor by a vote of 294-106. But Wednesday night, in a vote of
231-194 along almost strictly party lines, they approved the
procedures and paved the way toward passage on the floor.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., who had shepherded the contraceptive
measure through the House, was upset that Republican leaders simply
tossed it out in the final bill even though it had passed the full
House twice before and a similar measure had cleared the Senate
unanimously by voice vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican leaders should be ashamed of themselves,'' she
said. ``They have stomped all over democracy today in their rush to
kow-tow to their right wing.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a familiar theme among Democrats _ that the Republican
leaders are beholden to their conservative rank and file. But this
is increasingly not the case. As the legislative session hurtles
toward its conclusion, almost nothing from the conservative agenda
has advanced beyond symbolic votes on the House floor.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders have quite pointedly not held up the spending bills to
advance these causes, spurning conservatives equally with moderates
in the interests of reaching agreements and avoiding a government
shutdown so that they can keep the spotlight on impeachment
proceedings for Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   On the Senate side, Republicans were preparing for final passage
of the bill financing Veterans Affairs and the Housing and Urban
Affairs Department. That would bring the number of spending bills
Congress has completed action on to six, with seven remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those are expected to be wrapped into one big omnibus
package, perhaps by Saturday, although the negotiations with the
White House Wednesday evening could change everything.

DEMOCRATS IN LARGEST N.H. CITY TO SHUN KERRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOT LEHIGH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As US Senator John F. Kerry prepares to venture to New Hampshire
to test the presidential waters, the Manchester Democratic City
Committee wants to make one thing clear: Kerry will get no hearing
from them.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, committee members, who charge Kerry has twice committed
to speak at their events only to leave them in the lurch at the
last minute, have passed a motion against offering any further
invitations to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took a vote not to allow him any hospitality,'' said
chairman Raymond Buckley, a Democratic state representative from
Manchester. ``In all my years of being involved, I have never, ever
had somebody who was a prospective candidate for president treat
New Hampshire people like this,''
</P>
<P>
   Adds John Gross, the committee's vice president: ``The feeling
is that we were shunned.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so, says Lisa Mead, Kerry's state director, who Wednesday
blamed the mess on poor work by Kerry staffers. ``It was an
inexperienced staff, and the invitation was clearly mishandled from
the beginning,'' Mead said. ``The senator is sorry for that and I
am sorry for that.'' Still, Mead insisted that Kerry had never
actually committed to either event.
</P>
<P>
   That's not the way Buckley, widely credited with rebuilding and
re-energizing the Manchester Democratic City Committee, tells it.
He says Kerry's staff first accepted an invitation to speak at a
city committee fundraiser to honor a long-time Manchester public
official on Saturday, March 14.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had been told he would tentatively be coming, so we didn't
invite anyone else,'' said Buckley, who said the commitment was
firm enough that Kerry's staff was getting directions and making
arrangements to bring people from Boston to hear Kerry's speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few days before the event, we found out that he had decided
not to come,'' relates Buckley, who said the committee, suddenly
left without a guest of honor, had to scramble to put together a
call from Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Buckley says his next encounter with Kerry came at a St.
Patrick's Day event at the White House, where, he says, Kerry
apologized for not having made the Manchester fundraiser. Buckley
then told Kerry that the Manchester Democrats -- the state's
largest city committee -- were planning a June 19 fundraiser, and
asked the senator if he would be the guest of honor at that.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `That sounds fantastic, I definitely want to go, work
it out with my staff,' '' said Buckley, who said he proceeded to
talk to top Kerry staffers in both Boston and Washington, who told
him Kerry would come.
</P>
<P>
   Wary about his previous experience, Buckley says, he gave Kerry
staffers a drop-dead date by which Kerry would have to cancel.
According to Buckley, that day passed with no cancellation from
Kerry.
</P>
<P>
   But five days later, on the very day the newsletter containing
the invitations were going out to 1100 Manchester Democrats,
Buckley says, Kerry's staff called to say that Kerry wouldn't be
attended.
</P>
<P>
   That left the committee to prevail upon US Senator Robert Kerrey
(D-Nebraska) to fill in at the last minute -- and to mail another
notice to its members apprising them of the change.
</P>
<P>
   And, says Buckley, it left Manchester Democrats so angry at
Kerry that at their June meeting, the group of about 80
overwhelming voted not to extend any further invitations to Kerry
or to host him if he comes to Manchester.
</P>
<P>
   ``It left a real bad taste in our mouth when it comes to dealing
with Senator Kerry,'' said Buckley. ``It became a personal insult
to the people we were honoring.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those people was former Democratic City Committee member
C. Arthur Sousy. His daughter, Donna Soucy, a committee member and
a former legislator and Manchester alderman, agreed with Buckley
that committee members thought they had a firm commitment from
Kerry, and felt slighted as a result.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are very mad at him and very disappointed that he is
coming back up here, but has made no effort whatsoever to mend
fences,'' said Soucy.
</P>
<P>
   As the Globe reported Wednesday, Kerry has made plans for to
spend Oct. 23 in New Hampshire, raising money for Democrats there,
teaching a university class, meeting with activists, and testing
the presidential waters.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Mead stressed that Kerry was indeed apologetic. ``It
was a misunderstanding, we regret that, and hopefully we can start
anew,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But at the New Hampshire Democratic Party, chairman Jeff
Woodburn accused the Manchester Democrats of having taken ``a
short-sighted and petty'' stand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to be welcoming of any Democratic candidate who wants
to visit our state,'' said Woodburn. ``The last I knew, no one
needed an invitation from Ray Buckley to visit Manchester.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Harvey Lichtenstein, who took the Brooklyn Academy of
Music from an imperiled relic three decades ago to one of the
world's beacons of avant-garde music, theater, opera and dance,
will step down this summer as president and executive producer,
officials are to announce Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Lichtenstein, whose 31-year leadership often draws comparisons
with Joseph Papp's tenure at the widely influential Public Theater,
will stay on as a consultant. He will work primarily on two major
projects, a new four-screen cinema that opens in November and a
redevelopment plan for the area around the 90-year-old academy
building in the Fort Greene section of Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   But Lichtenstein said that he had already started handing over
power to Karen Brooks Hopkins, who will assume his title of
president, and Joseph Melillo, who will assume his title of
executive producer. The transition is scheduled for July 1.
</P>
<P>
   Lichtenstein said he wanted more time for reading and travel,
that it was time to turn the Brooklyn Academy over to younger
leadership, and that he had no desire to linger on, hovering behind
the curtain as the academy's guiding spirit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to have the job of running this institution,''
said Lichtenstein, a 69-year-old Brooklyn native and former dancer,
whose tenure is synonymous with the careers of many of the most
acclaimed innovators of recent decades, including Philip Glass,
Robert Wilson, Peter Brook, Merce Cunningham and Laurie Anderson.
``We've talked about me doing some special assignments outside the
day-to-day running of the institution, but I need to do that and
stay out of people's hair. I've got to. If I can't, I've just got
to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Lichtenstein is being replaced by his two chief lieutenants,
both of whom have long associations with the academy. Ms. Hopkins,
currently executive vice president and chief operating officer, has
been there since 1979. She will be in charge of financial,
fund-raising and operations. Melillo, currently producing director,
will take over creative control of programming. Except for a brief
hiatus in the early 1990s, he has headed the Brooklyn Academy's
Next Wave Festival since its inception in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Lichtenstein said the three had worked together for so long, he
had no qualms about the transition, but the news jolted many
admirers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I heard it, I had to sit down,'' said choreographer Bill
T. Jones, whose ``We Set Out Early ... Visibility Was Poor'' had
its debut at the academy on Tuesday as part of this year's Next
Wave Festival.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like my whole professional career is defined by work he's
been a part of,'' Jones said. ``The great thing about Harvey is
that he always wants your most notorious work. Harvey always gets
excited by what you're excited about. He'll say no, but he'll say
it with a smile. And he says yes at all the right times.''
</P>
<P>
   The Brooklyn Academy of Music was founded in 1861. After its
original Brooklyn Heights home burned down, it moved into its
current neo-Italianate building, which it built in 1908. In its
prime it was host to such artists as Enrico Caruso, Isadora Duncan
and Arturo Toscanini. But as Brooklyn declined, so did the academy.
When Lichtenstein arrived, it was owned by the city and was
presenting a slapdash array of events while it was rented out for
karate classes and a private boys high school. There was talk of
razing it and turning it into a tennis court.
</P>
<P>
   Lichtenstein said that at the beginning he didn't exactly have a
plan for turning the institution around but that he did have a
guiding instinct.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew, and I knew it instinctively, that in order for BAM to
survive it would have to establish an identity, one that was strong
and distinctive,'' said Lichtenstein, whose blaring ties, angular
features and bristling eyebrows led one critic to describe his
looks as ``a German Expressionist's idea of an American gangster.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So I had an instinct and a couple of mentors. I knew it needed
to have its own singularity. But how to do it? I tested the waters
here and there to see what made sense, what would carry the idea
forward,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His plan for doing that was a stretch, to say the least.
Lichtenstein turned his attention to the avant-garde, figuring that
no one in New York was doing it in a big way and that it was the
only way to create an identity that would lure a Manhattan audience
over the bridge to Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   In his first season he booked Alban Berg's atonal ``Lulu,''
performed by Sarah Caldwell's American National Opera company, and
gave Merce Cunningham's maverick dance company its first major New
York season. Soon he presided over the return from European exile
of Julian Beck's Living Theater, and offered groundbreaking works
by Twyla Tharp, Jerzy Grotowski and Robert Wilson as well as Peter
Brook's landmark production of ``A Midsummer Night's Dream.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not easy going.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did a lot of things where no one came,'' he said. ``Merce
Cunningham used to play in the opera house, which seats 2,000
people, and 400, 500 people would show up. It drove me nuts.
There's nothing more depressing to come to a house and know that
you've got an extraordinary artist there, and see it only a quarter
full.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the setbacks were permanent. Perhaps Lichtenstein's
biggest disappointment was an attempt in the late 1970s to create a
theater repertory company modeled after European ventures like the
Royal Shakespeare Company. It lasted two seasons and left a
financial hole that took several seasons to fill.
</P>
<P>
   But Lichtenstein did succeed in building an identity, an
audience and an international profile. And he skillfully developed
an institution, with strengths in fund-raising and marketing to
build on the adventurous fare.
</P>
<P>
   A breakthrough came with the first Next Wave Festival in 1983,
which became a major annual event. But Lichtenstein said he first
felt convinced that his vision would work a few years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1981, we did Philip Glass' opera `Satyagraha,' about
Gandhi's early years as a lawyer in South Africa,'' he said. ``We
were really nervous about its drawing power, and I remember how
stunned we were when we did five performances at the opera house,
and they were all sold out. It was then that we realized the
audiences had caught up to the work we were championing.''

SCALLOPS CROWDING SEABED, RESEARCHERS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Scallops have grown so fat and abundant in the part of
Georges Bank closed to fishing that some appear to be dying from
overcrowding, researchers said Wednesday, fueling fishermen's
claims that federal regulators have overstated the fishing crisis,
at least in the scallop industry.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers from the University of Massachusetts at Dartmouth
said that a new survey of 1,800 square miles of Georges Bank,
closed due to overfishing since 1994, found more than triple the
number of scallops compared to areas being actively fished. In some
spots, many scallops were dead, perhaps a result of overcrowding,
they said, though the scallops could have been killed by predators
or other causes as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's substantially higher quanitities of larger scallops in
the closed area than in the open areas,'' said Brian Rothschild,
director of the university's Center for Marine Science and
Technology, ``At least on Georges Bank, the closed areas and the
open areas ... would sustain a pretty good fishery in perpetuity.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be good news to scallop fishermen who face tightening
limits on fishing from the New England Fishery Management Council.
Federal biologists have argued that too many scallops are being
caught and the region's scallop fleet needs to be sharply reduced
from the current 211 boats.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, fishermen said the survey results prove what they've
been saying all along: there are still plenty of scallops left and
there's no need for more fishing limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fishermen have been going to the council meetings and giving
their input as to there being plenty of (scallop) resource, but ...
we haven't been taken seriously because we're not scientists,''
said Bobby Bruno, a New Bedford-based scalloper who helped on the
study.
</P>
<P>
   But John Boreman at the National Marine Fisheries Service said
it is too soon to conclude that the scallop industry is not in
trouble. He said the closed area survey results, collected under
National Marine Fisheries Service guidance by six commercial
scallop boats, have not even been tabulated yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crisis right now doesn't include that closed area,'' said
Boreman, noting that federal biologists fully expected the scallops
to recover when fishing stopped. He pointed out that the scallopers
harvest 70 to 80 percent of all the scallops annually in open
fishing areas, which would quickly wipe out the Georges Bank
recovery.
</P>
<P>
   The survey _ designed jointly by the University of
Massachusetts, the National Marine Fisheries Service and the
Virginia Institute of Marine Science _ marked the first time
scientists had extensively used fishing boats to study scallops.
Though the National Marine Fisheries Service samples scallops
regularly, scallopers question the accuracy of their gloomy
forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   While not directly contradicting federal findings, the new
survey provides far more detail about the scallops' remarkable
ability to bounce back when fishing stops. While cod populations in
the closed area of Georges Bank have rebounded slowly, individual
scallops in the closed areas are two to three times larger than in
the open fishing grounds, Bruno said.
</P>
<P>
   Fishermen, who have watched their catch drop from 17.4 million
pounds in 1997 to 13.2 million last year, want regulators to let
them back in to the closed area immediately.
</P>
<P>
   But National Marine Fisheries Service officials say the
reopening of Georges Bank to scallopers could harm other depleted
marine populations in the once-great fishing ground. During the
experiment in the closed area, scallopers also caught flounder and
other groundfish as they pulled their scallop dredges along the sea
bottom.
</P>
<P>
   A more promising approach, say scallop researchers, might be to
use the information from the survey as the basis for a new system
of regulation where scallop beds are periodically closed to allow
populations to recover.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could close some of the open areas and open some of the
closed areas and come up with a rotational scheme for harvesting
these scallops that would be similar to the way forests are
rotated,'' said Rothschild of the University of
Massachusetts/Dartmouth.

 NEW YORK: were championing.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Melillo and Ms. Hopkins, interviewed separately, each offered
the identical explanation for Lichtenstein's success: his
willingness to take risks. But it was both his artistic vision and
his personal qualities that endeared him to artists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harvey's very smart and very kind, and that's a rare
combination,'' said performance artist Laurie Anderson. ``He's
very, I hate the word, but it's the only one I can think of,
nurturing. A lot of people feel a tremendous amount of loyalty to
him because they feel comfortable there. He has his temper, but his
personality and his adventurous sense about the events he puts on,
have allowed him to play a totally unique role.''
</P>
<P>
   Lichtenstein is not gone yet. Wednesday he announced a $1.5
million gift from the Peter Jay Sharp Foundation. Half the money
will go to the new Brooklyn Academy of Music Rose Cinema. The rest
will go to operating expenses. He also announced that Daniel
Talbot, owner of the Lincoln Plaza Cinemas and New Yorker Films,
would be the director of film programming at the academy.
</P>
<P>
   Melillo said he was particularly interested in more
international and technological fare and in younger artists. But he
said that he and Lichtenstein had worked together for so long that
audiences accustomed to Lichtenstein's vision would not see major
changes at the academy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think BAM has mushroomed to a level with the art community,
that there's a BAM identity that goes beyond Harvey,'' he said. ``I
don't think it's personality driven anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Lichtenstein agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've built a strong group of people who've been together for
a long period of time and are committed to what we do here,'' he
said. ``We all share a vision for what BAM is and where it needs to
go. They'll take their own risks and go where their instincts take
them. I'll really love to see where they take it.''

ANALYSIS: NEW ONLINE DEALS ACKNOWLEDGE SUCCESS OF AMAZON.COM 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the stock market is to be believed _ and that's rarely a good
bet _ the prospect of mergers among online merchants in both books
and music is dire news for Amazon.com Inc., the most popular store
on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But in many ways, the prospect of two online deals represent an
acknowledgment of just how strong a market position Amazon.com
holds.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a sentiment among merchants that Amazon is the
Microsoft of E-commerce,'' said Scott Heiferman, the chief
executive of I-Traffic, an ad agency that specializes in electronic
commerce. ``There is a respect, a fear and a morbid fear. That's
why people are bulking up.''
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Amazon sank $14.875, or 14 percent Wednesday, to
$93.4375. That follows the news Tuesday night that Bertelsmann AG,
the German media conglomerate, would take a 50 percent stake in the
online operation of Barnes &AMP; Noble, the country's largest bookstore
chain. And on Wednesday CD Now and N2K, the two largest online
music sellers, confirmed reports that they are discussing a merger.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon dismissed the moves.
``From our point of view, nothing has changed,'' he said in an
interview Wednesday. ``Our strategy is always customer obsession
rather than competitor obsession.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts argued that it is the competition, in fact, that should
be worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an increasing sense of concern about whether the No.
2 player can survive,'' said Keith Benjamin, an analyst at
BancBoston Robertson Stevens. ``With CD Now and N2K talking about
merging and Barnes &AMP; Noble crying uncle, there is a pervasive fear
among the wannabes.''
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin said that the top company in each category appears to
be getting the lion's share of business. As an example, he pointed
to the surging profitability of Yahoo, the leader in what is known
as Internet portals, all-inclusive guides to the Internet. On
Wednesday, Yahoo announced that it earned $16.7 million, or 15
cents a share, far more than the 9 cents that analysts estimated.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, investors leapt to buy stocks of Internet
retailers because it seems so much more efficient to create a
virtual store that can reach millions of people rather than build a
chain of physical stores. In recent months, shares of online stores
other than Amazon have fallen.
</P>
<P>
   Investors have realized that so far the efficiencies of the
Internet have led to lower prices for consumers rather than higher
profits for the merchants. Moreover, by traditional marketing
measures many of the new online stores have spent so much on
marketing and price cutting to gain customers that it is unclear
whether they will ever earn a return on their investment. With 3.1
million book customers, Amazon has been able to start selling music
at a lower cost than its competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The E-commerce market of music and video inherently has an
extremely thin margin,'' said Richard Wolter, the chairman of
Columbia House, the big music club owned by Time Warner Inc. and
Sony Corp. ``The prize is going to the person who can leverage
marketing efficiencies and customer relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of the two mergers say that the combination will help
reduce the cost of winning new customers by lessening the
competition by the merchants to buy the rights to be featured
prominently on sites like Yahoo and America Online. Many of the
online merchants flush with cash from their initial public
offerings have offered millions or tens of millions of dollars to
be exclusive book or music stores on the portal sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure that AOL and the portals are not happy about this,''
Heiferman said. ``If you are auctioning some thing, it's better to
have two buyers than one.''

SPORTS COLUMN: `EACH FAMILY VOICE MUST BE HEARD'

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Yankee fans split a double-header Wednesday, but
George Steinbrenner lost two.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Yankees lost the argument and the game to the
Cleveland Indians, 4-1, the principal owner and Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani lost in the Bronx County Courthouse up on the Grand
Concourse beyond the Stadium's outfield facade.
</P>
<P>
   In that judicial fortress, state Supreme Court Justice Douglas
McKeon threw Wednesday's best pitch: that a referendum can be on
the Nov. 3 ballot on whether New York City taxpayers want a West
Side stadium in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Peter Vallone, the City Council speaker, suggested
such a referendum a few months ago, Steinbrenner and his political
puppet, the mayor in the Yankee cap and the Yankee jacket, have
opposed it. They fear, understandably, that the public would reject
it.
</P>
<P>
   Court appeals could snarl the situation long enough to keep the
referendum off this year's ballot. But if it's on the ballot, you
can forget about a West Side stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Every baseball fan that wants to keep the Yankees where they are
would vote against it. So would every taxpayer that doesn't want
the city to gift-wrap a $1 billion stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Six weeks after the City Council filed a lawsuit against the
mayor's improperly setting a Charter Commission to keep the stadium
issue off the ballot, McKeon Wednesday denied the motion by the
mayor, the Charter Commission and the Board of Elections for a
summary judgment.
</P>
<P>
   In a Sept. 28 proposal, Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx borough
president, offered the most sensible and financially responsible
solution yet _ a $533 million plan to renovate Yankee Stadium, add
120 luxury boxes, ease traffic snarls, create a Metro North
railroad stop behind home plate and redevelop the neighborhood with
a waterfront park, a Yankee Hall of Fame and sports-related stores.
</P>
<P>
   If the Yankees eventually decide or are forced to remain in a
renovated or new Yankee Stadium, their fans should put a plaque for
Judge McKeon out there in Monument Park in deep left field
alongside those for Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Joe DiMaggio, Mickey
Mantle and so many others.
</P>
<P>
   ``The urgency to find a proposal to blockade the Council's
Yankee Stadium proposal rendered the work of the Commission in 1998
a virtual charade,'' McKeon wrote. ``Perhaps the Council's Yankee
Stadium referendum is part opinion poll motivated by political
considerations. However, Yankee Stadium is uniquely a public
property. And its destiny should be decided by the public.''
</P>
<P>
   McKeon, tall and reddish haired, was born in the Bronx and still
lives in the Pelham Parkway neighborhood. He understands what
Yankee Stadium means to the Bronx and its citizens, and to Yankee
fans everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   As a youngster, the son of a Bronx courthouse officer, he
watched Mantle hit home runs at Yankee Stadium. He saw Ingemar
Johansson knock down Floyd Patterson seven times there in winning
the heavyweight title. He saw the Giants popularize pro football
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision to abandon an athletic stadium involves emotional
and economic factors,'' McKeon wrote. ``Ebbets Field, the Polo
Grounds _ shouldn't the public have the right to say whether Yankee
Stadium meets that same fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the expenditure of public funds approaching $1 billion is
estimated to build a new stadium on the west side of Manhattan,
does it offend the spirit of the charter to permit the public to
participate in that decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each family, at one time or another, makes a determination
that impacts on its future in a unique and special way. The
purchase of a new home comes to mind, hardly an everyday decision.
For the family of New Yorkers, the decision to construct a new
stadium is akin to the purchase of a new home, for which each voice
in the family must be heard.''
</P>
<P>
   You would think that Steinbrenner, who is always preaching how
the Yankees are a family, would appreciate the judge's ``family''
reasoning.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the principal owner had ``no comment'' Wednesday on
McKeon's ruling. Quite simply, he wants a new glitzy stadium on the
West Side or in New Jersey. But the West Side referendum would be
voted down, as a New Jersey referendum was in 1986. And there is no
financing and no site for a stadium in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday you lost, George. Two.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Yankees have prided themselves all year on not
taking anything for granted, for playing smart. But Wednesday,
their second baseman, Chuck Knoblauch, allowed a moment of stubborn
frustration to possess him and it cost the Yankees the tiebreaking
run in a 12-inning, 4-1 loss to Cleveland in Game 2 of the American
League Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees and Indians, now tied at one game apiece in the
best-of-seven series, will play Game 3 Friday night in Cleveland,
where the Yankees' Andy Pettitte will face the Indians' Bartolo
Colon.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees and Indians were tied 1-1 before 57,128 at Yankee
Stadium when Jim Thome singled off Jeff Nelson to open the 12th
inning and was replaced by pinch-runner Enrique Wilson. Travis
Fryman turned to bunt the runner to second and pushed a ball up the
first base line, where the Yankees' first baseman Tino Martinez
fielded it and threw toward first. Knoblauch was covering the bag.
</P>
<P>
   Fryman, however, was running inside the first base line, and
more importantly outside the 3-foot lane that runs the final 45
feet to first base and which batters are required to use while
going to first or risk being called out in the umpire's judgment.
Martinez's throw hit Fryman in the back and the ball rolled behind
first base.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch, sure that Fryman was guilty of interference and would
be called out, stood and pointed to the spot of the alleged
infraction, staring at home plate umpire Ted Hendry. And Knoblauch
stood. And he stood. And he stood.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, meanwhile, rounded second, then rounded third. By the
time Knoblauch finally retrieved the ball and threw home, Wilson
was across the plate with a dive, with the tie-breaking run.
</P>
<P>
   The inning continued. Kenny Lofton eventually hit a two-run
single, increasing the Cleveland lead to 4-1. When Knoblauch was
introduced to bat in the Yankee 12th, he was booed lustily.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the Yankees don't seem so invincible, tied in the
series, having missed numerous chances to push across the winning
run in the first nine innings; the Yankees went 1-for-12 with
runners in scoring position. Their 11-game winning streak, dating
to the last seven games of the regular season, is over.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland took the lead in the the fourth inning, on David
Justice's home run _ the first time in the Yankees' five postseason
games they had fallen behind. Three innings later, however, Scott
Brosius pulled a two-out double into the left field corner,
enabling Bernie Williams to amble home with the tying run.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees and Indians played into the eighth, each side
understanding that one run, one 360-foot journey around the bases,
could settle the outcome. One run would give the Yankees more
confidence, more reason to believe they cannot be beaten. One run
would give the Cleveland Indians reason to believe they can
overcome one of the greatest teams in the last half-century, as
they return home for Game 3, 4 and 5.
</P>
<P>
   With one freakish play in the Cleveland eighth, the Indians
suddenly seemed on the verge of scoring that one run. Omar Vizquel
reached out and fought off a pitch and looped a high pop down the
left field line; Shane Spencer, the left fielder, ran and ran and
ran and dove, but the ball barely eluded him and splashed onto the
white foul line, bouncing past Spencer and into the corner.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Spencer scrambled to his feet, retrieved the ball
and returned it to the infield, Vizquel was standing at third base,
with one out.
</P>
<P>
   Justice was coming to bat, four innings after he had launched
one of David Cone's curveballs over the right-center field wall for
Cleveland's run. Mel Stottlemyre, the Yankees' pitching coach, went
to the mound to discuss the options with Cone. They could walk
Justice intentionally and take their chances with the right-handed
slugger Manny Ramirez. Cone threw three straight balls to Justice,
and it figured they would walk him.
</P>
<P>
   But Cone flipped a curve for a strike, tried another _ and
Justice chopped the ball just in front of home plate. Joe Girardi,
the Yankees' catcher, pounced on the ball, looking back Vizquel at
third and throwing to first. Two out.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez came to the plate against a tiring Cone, who was 113
pitches deep into his day. With a 2-1 count, Cone tried a slider
that spun flatly; Ramirez turned and blasted it high and long and
far foul. Knowing he'd gotten lucky, Cone walked behind the mound,
unhappy. Girardi walked out to visit Cone, to review their options
on the 2-2 pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Cone threw again. Ramirez hit a soft grounder back to Cone, who
grabbed it and gingerly threw the ball to first, an egg toss. Three
outs. Cone took a step toward the dugout, planted his feet and
pumped a fist, like Tiger Woods sinking a 60-foot putt. The gallery
roared. The Yankees and Indians, both even par.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees had two out and two on in their eighth, before Tino
Martinez struck out. Tim Raines, leading off the ninth against
Cleveland's Paul Shuey, worked the count to 3-1 before hitting a
high chopper off home plate, sprinting on his 39-year-old legs,
beating the throw to the bag. Homer Bush, the Yankees' pinch-runner
deluxe, replaced Raines and stole second on the next pitch.
</P>
<P>
   But Spencer struck out, failing to advance Bush. Having seen
Brosius come through time and again in the playoffs, the Indians
elected to intentionally walk him and face Girardi. Jorge Posada
pinch-hit for Girardi and skipped a perfect double-play grounder to
second, ending the inning and forcing extra innings.
</P>
<P>
   To that point, the Yankees were 1-for-12 with runners in scoring
position, the Indians 0-for-3.
</P>
<P>
   Cone struggled in the early innings, lacking control of his
slider and trying to find a way through. This is when Cone is at
his best, said Girardi, when he must invent and improvise, a
pinstriped Houdini. Justice hit his home run in the fourth and then
Ramirez walked.
</P>
<P>
   Cone struck out Thome on an inside fastball _ appearing to
benefit from the wide strike zone of the home plate umpire Ted
Hendry _ but Fryman singled. Pitching carefully, Cone walked Brian
Giles, loading the bases. Sandy Alomar reached out and hit a hard
smash toward the right side of the infield, where Martinez knocked
down the ball and flipped to Cone covering first base for the third
out.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Nagy shut out the Yankees for the first six innings,
allowing just three hits.

BELGRADE BARS U.N. WAR-CRIMES INVESTIGATORS  (JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By MARLISE SIMONS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE HAGUE, Netherlands _ Yugoslavia has told the war crimes
tribunal here that U.N. investigators will not be allowed to look
into reported war crimes in Kosovo, and it has refused to grant the
visas that the court has requested, tribunal officials said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said the government of President Slobodan
Milosevic had also threatened to close the liaison office of the
tribunal in Belgrade if the court continued to collect evidence on
massacres and other reported war crimes in the province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The rebuff to the tribunal was mitigated, however, when
Milosevic, under U.S. pressure, permitted the departure of a man
who says he is a witness to the massacre of ethnic Albanians in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The decision against allowing investigators ``is totally
unacceptable,'' said the deputy prosecutor of the tribunal, Graham
Blewitt.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will not stop us from what we have a right to do,''
Blewitt said.
</P>
<P>
   If Belgrade persists in banning the investigators, including
those who already have visas, diplomats said, another noisy
confrontation seems unavoidable. The U.N. Security Council, which
created the tribunal to prosecute war crimes in the former
Yugoslavia passed resolutions in March and September to reaffirm
the tribunal's jurisdiction in the Kosovo conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Although Belgrade has refused to recognize the tribunal's
authority, it gradually accepted that investigators could examine
Serbia and Kosovo, because in some instances their investigations
concerned crimes reportedly committed against Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   But tensions came to a head on Friday, when the prosecutor's
staff asked Belgrade why it was delaying four visas that the
tribunal requested more than a month ago. Blewitt said the response
from the foreign ministry in Belgrade was that ``the tribunal has
no jurisdiction to conduct investigations in Kosovo'' and would no
longer be allowed to do so.

KOREAN LEADER, IN JAPAN, URGES HEALING OF OLD WOUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ President Kim Dae-jung of South Korea arrived in Japan
on Wednesday for a long-awaited state visit and immediately called
for a closer partnership and an end to the longstanding tensions
between the neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   At a state dinner Wednesday night, Kim stood up to toast Emperor
Akihito, whose father, Hirohito, presided over Japan for much of
its brutal occupation of the Korean peninsula until the end of
World War II. Avoiding the comments that past South Korean leaders
always made on such occasions about the ``unfortunate past,'' Kim
urged a ``forward-looking partnership.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation surrounding the two countries demands a closer
partnership,'' Kim said. He later added, ``The Korean people and my
administration are willing, open-minded and fully prepared to
exchange and cooperate with our neighbor.''
</P>
<P>
   Kim has called for reconciliation of every kind since he took
office in February, and he has urged that Korea lift the ban on
Japanese music, comics, movies and television programs. That ban is
a measure of the deep hostility to all things Japanese that remains
widespread among Koreans, although the black market in Seoul for
Japanese tapes suggests a bittersweet fascination with Japanese
culture.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese officials, apparently seeing a rare opportunity to mend
ties with their neighbor, seem ready to reciprocate by making an
unusually humble apology for the colonial past.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi is expected to offer the most
contrite formulation yet for a Japanese apology to Korea. The
wording has been under negotiation between the sides for weeks,
which means that it comes as much from committees as from the
heart, but the result apparently will be a more direct official
apology than Japan was ever prepared to make in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Japan and Korea have a long and intertwined history, but Koreans
are still haunted by the Japanese annexation and occupation of the
Korean Peninsula from 1910 to 1945. Japan built roads, schools and
factories, but Koreans were harshly governed and forced to take
Japanese names.
</P>
<P>
   Kim can speak fluent Japanese, but like most Koreans he is
reluctant to use it because of the bitter memories it evokes.
Although in the United States in June, Kim addressed Congress in
English, which he does not speak as well as Japanese, Kim is using
Korean for all his addresses throughout his trip to Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in any language a president could scarcely have been more
gracious than Kim was in his toast to Akihito. Kim warmly thanked
Japan for helping during South Korea's economic crisis over the
last year, and his only suggestions that Japan face its past were
veiled in several layers of silk.
</P>
<P>
   ``If our two nations are to succeed in cooperative efforts, we
must first respect each other and open our hearts,'' Kim urged.
</P>
<P>
   Delicately reminding his hosts that many Koreans believe
Japanese society has not yet acknowledged the truth about its past,
Kim added, ``Let us forge a neighborly relationship based on
truthfulness and a cooperative spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   Akihito, whom Kim invited to Korea and who is expected to visit
Seoul in 2001 or 2002, responded with his own expression of regret
about the occupation _ a reference carefully crafted by Japanese
officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``The history of close exchange had a reverse side at one period
when Japan brought great suffering on the people of the Korean
Peninsula,'' Akihito said. ``The deep sorrow that I feel over this
never leaves my memory.''

 &HT;    Low voter turnout could spell disaster for Democrats
 &HT;    By Dale Dempsey
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1992, Ohio voters helped elevate Bill Clinton to the
presidency by going to the polls in the greatest numbers of the
past two decades.
</P>
<P>
   Six years later, Clinton is mired in scandal, the public seems
more disinterested than ever in politics and some experts fear
turnout in the Nov. 3 election will mark an all-time low.
</P>
<P>
   That could spell trouble for the Democratic Party and, some
believe, for the country's form of government as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are witnessing is a progressive meltdown in civic
engagement, a major danger to American democracy,'' said Curtis
Gans, director of the Committee for the Study of the American
Electorate, a not-for-profit public policy center located in
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Gans' study shows voter turnout nationally has decreased 25
percent in the last 36 years, plunging to the the lowest levels in
mid-term history in the 1998 statewide primaries. Ohio and the
Miami Valley mirror those national trends.
</P>
<P>
   Low voter turnout may merely be a symptom of far deeper problems
_ beyond apathy, general satisfaction with the economy or simply
being fed up with l'affair Clinton-Lewinsky-Starr. There is
evidence of widespread loss of faith by people in their government
and other public institutions. The possibility of affecting change
will still draw people to the polls, but those opportunities seem
fewer and farther between.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be that people voted because it was the responsible
thing to do,'' said Dennis Lieberman, chairman of the Montgomery
County Democratic Party. ``That is a day gone by.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman said that close-to-home issues, such as workers'
compensation, will still draw people to the polls. However, two
issues on the Nov. 3 ballot _ a 2.5-mill refunding renewal levy for
Sinclair Community College and the new Dayton City Charter changes
_ have backers worried that a low turnout could lead to defeat.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Jeff Jacobson of Phillipsburg, chairman of the
Montgomery County Republican Party, said that low voter
participation can hurt both parties, but that the Democratic Party
has seen a loss of active voters nationally in some traditional
strongholds like New York. In this year's primaries, Democrats saw
voter turnout hit record lows in 20 states, according to Gans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you have people too complacent to vote it can hurt
those leading the races as well,'' Jacobson said. ``They don't vote
because they think it is in the bag.''
</P>
<P>
   As recently as 1982, Democrats held a 2-1 ratio over Republicans
in both primaries and registration, Gans' report says. Now
Democrats are in the minority in Congress, governorships and many
state legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Gans notes, the decline in voter participation comes
at a time when there are fewer barriers to voting than at any time
in the nation's history. Women, who won the right to vote in 1920,
started voting in equal numbers as men in the 1980s, and
liberalized voting and registration laws led to the demise of the
whites-only political system that dominated the South for decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should have produced higher turnout,'' Gans said. ``What
has eroded over the last three decades is the motivation to vote.''
</P>
<P>
   The high point of public involvement in the political process
were the years 1860 to 1900, according to Walter Dean Burnham,
political science professor at the University of Texas. Lincoln won
the presidency in 1860 with 82 percent of eligible voters showing
up to vote. In the election year of 1898, 92 percent of eligible
voters in Ohio cast a ballot.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the story is quite different.
</P>
<P>
   The report by the Committee for the Study of the American
Electorate found:
</P>
<P>
   Overall turnout of eligible voters fell 10 percent, from 19.4 in
1994 to 17.4 in the 1998 primaries.
</P>
<P>
   The average Democratic turnout fell 12 percent, to a record low
of 9.5 percent of those eligible to vote. Average Republican
turnout was even lower, dropping from 8.7 percent in 1994 to 8
percent in 1998. Based on this average, a majority winner in these
primaries could have emerged the victor with less than 5 percent of
the eligible vote.
</P>
<P>
   Overall turnout in the May primary was down sharply in Ohio,
with both Republicans and Democrats losing voters. Overall turnout
was 24 percent in Montgomery County, 25 percent in Warren County
and 28 percent in Greene County.
</P>
<P>
   An analysis of census data indicates that Americans over the age
of 65 are the only group increasing turnout. Turnouts declined for
both the 25-34 and the 35-44 age groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``That portrays a pretty bleak future for the nation's
leadership,'' Gans said. ``Voting tends to be the lowest common
denominator in politics. People who don't vote don't participate in
anything else, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Low voter turnout also opens the door for relatively small
groups of people committed to a limited agenda to control the
process, Gans said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have a situation where an average of less than 5
percent of the electorate can determine the nominees and direction
of either major political party, you are inviting intense factions
to take over one or both parties and skew the public agenda,'' Gans
said.
</P>
<P>
   Common wisdom says that rainy days and low voter turnout favors
Republicans, but Montgomery County Democratic chairman Lieberman
thinks the current downward trend hurts both parties and the entire
electoral political process itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is definitely a problem,'' he said. ``In some elections,
just 17 percent of the people eligible have selected our leaders.
That is not representative of the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Gans' study shows that the nation's poorest people _ those
making less than $15,000 _ are among the least frequent voters.
Gans and others believe that debunks the theory that satisfaction
with the economy can lead to voter apathy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The poor are completely disenfranchised, they are in a
survival mode,'' Lieberman said. ``We are trying to work on that
because those are our people, but it is difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Reasons for voter apathy are hard to pinpoint, but a report by
the Kettering Foundation, Governing in America , offers some clues.
It was released in June of this year after the foundation conducted
a series of focus groups with citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``What became clear is that despite good economic times people
feel disconnected with our government institutions,'' said John
Doble, who runs a New Jersey research firm and helped prepare the
foundation report.
</P>
<P>
   Among the frustrations voiced were the increasing incivility of
the public debate and the growing influence of money and special
interests, Doble said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People feel they don't have a voice in the debate,'' he added.
``Citizens are the lifeblood of a democratic society. When people
feel alienated from its institutions, something is seriously
wrong.''

<P>
   ``Jon Jerde is the Bernini of our time,'' Steve Wynn declared
grandly. And, he continued, ``these are the cathedrals of our time.
This is the future of architecture.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``cathedrals'' touted by Wynn _ a pontiff of the material
world _ are Disneyland, the Mall of America and his own casino
extravaganza, Bellagio, due to open next week in Las Vegas. All
three are landmarks of the trend for fusing architecture, commerce
and fantasy, of which Jerde is a pioneer. Jerde, a self-described
``experiential architect'' in Los Angeles, designed the Mall of
America and, with Wynn's in-house team Atlandia Design, Bellagio.
</P>
<P>
   Bernini, the master of Roman Baroque, might enjoy Jerde's modern
American variant, employing exaggerated color, spatial tricks and
theatricality. Bellagio is one of the few casinos in Las Vegas that
actually looks good in daylight. Solid, three-dimensional, dripping
with landscaped patios and balustraded terraces, it is as charming
and persuasive an Italian idyll as is possible in the shadow of a
looming 36-story, 3,000-room hotel whose gargantuan presence no
amount of scale-reducing applied moldings and friezes can diminish.
</P>
<P>
   At Bellagio, Wynn wanted elegance and romance. Drawing on Lake
Como in Italy and its shore-side town of Bellagio for inspiration,
Jerde's firm, the Jerde Partnership International, planned and
designed a painterly composition of Italianate buildings
surrounding an artificial lake, so richly crafted they could
actually pass for authentic. (Atlandia designed the interiors.)
</P>
<P>
   With Bellagio, Wynn moves his casinos another notch toward the
bourgeois respectability that began with family-friendly glitz at
Treasure Island and the Mirage, and now is culminating in fine art
and architecture at the polite, softly pretty, neon-free new hotel.
Yet Jerde is surprisingly low-key about the project, despite the
fact that his firm spent four years on it.
</P>
<P>
   At his home in Los Angeles, a rustic dwelling in the Santa
Monica Mountains, he explained that Bellagio was ``Steve's
vision.'' It is small fry compared to his Big Idea: the remaking of
cities with entertainment as the core.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, Jerde, now 58, recognized that ``the consumption
addiction is what will bring people out and together,'' and he has
made a career of feeding it with his controversial brand of pop
public space.
</P>
<P>
   People who love the messy urbanism of traditional cities may
feel profound discomfort at this apparent repackaging of the urban
realm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Architecture as packaging or playacting, as disengagement from
reality, is a notion whose time, alas, seems to have come,''
mourned Ada Louise Huxtable in her 1997 book, ``The Unreal America:
Architecture and Illusion'' (New Press).
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, Jerde launched his career with Horton Plaza in San
Diego, which wed the conventional suburban mall _ anchoring
department stores, shops and movie houses _ with the specialty
shops, food courts and party ambiance of the quaint festival
centers popularized by the Rouse marketplaces in the '70s. This
six-block profusion of cheap and cheerful buildings and public
spaces helped turn around the fortunes of downtown San Diego. It
also helped to spawn the now ubiquitous ``urban entertainment
center,'' promoted by many developers and city planners as the
panacea for declining downtowns, from Times Square to Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Jerde (pronounced JER-dee) and a team of Los Angeles
designers and architects created Citywalk, an upbeat distillation
of Los Angeles' architectural and graphic landmarks into an
artificial street at the Universal City studios and theme park.
Herbert Muschamp, the New York Times' architecture critic, at its
opening soon after the Los Angeles riots, wrote that with its
``zippy collage of signs and storefronts,'' Citywalk ``is a shiny
new wheel in the pop machine that boosts the city's rhythm.'' He
added that its view ``of harmonized diversity is a hokey Hollywood
ending. Would a sad ending be better?''
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, at the invitation of Wynn, the Jerde firm designed
the ``Fremont Street Experience,'' a transformation of Las Vegas'
downtown main street into a covered ``destination.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Jerde completed Canal City, a futuristic mall
with hotels, shops and explosive fountains in a canyon of buildings
snaking along a newly created canal in a disused industrial area in
Fukuoka, Japan.
</P>
<P>
   While conceptually ambitious, these projects are essentially
privately owned pedestrian shopping malls. Next stop is real
city-making: 24-hour, multi-block, private and public developments
comprising shops, entertainment, houses, offices and, in some
cases, traffic. The Jerde group has such projects underway in
Japan, Taiwan and Warsaw as well as in Kansas City, Mo., and Salt
Lake City. ``We've got some lulus,'' Jerde said, with childlike
excitement. ``All of these middle American cities need it,'' he
added, referring to his brand of urban renewal, ``because they are
the ones with the least to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerde was sitting in the garden of his home, the Stone House,
eagerly awaiting the return from school of a young son, the progeny
of his fourth marriage. The house where he lives with his wife,
Janice Ambry, a residential architect, is dark, eccentric, suffused
with the odor of wood floors and paneling.
</P>
<P>
   Built over two decades with raw stone quarried from the
property, it is part Tyrolean hut, part cave, more somber than
Jerde's trademark festive malls, and less high-tech _ materials are
all natural, fireplaces are the only source of heat and there isn't
a computer in sight. But in other ways, it reflects his work, with
its textured surfaces, decorative furnishings and potpourri of
objects _ Buddhas' heads, a silk mandala, a Maori mask, intricate
carved wood columns from Nepal, an Eames chair _ all cast in high
relief by theatrical lighting.
</P>
<P>
   In the garden, behind Jerde, is a stone fireplace he built _ the
``spite-wall'' he cheerfully calls it _ to separate himself from
his third wife, who, on leaving him, took up residence in a house
they owned next door. Like the house, the fireplace appears to have
emerged from the ground; together they embody Jerde's paradoxical
architectural goal: to imbue commercial, modern environments with a
sense of the organic, of having been accreted over time.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Both gregarious and a loner, Jerde considers himself a creature
of the globe: ``I have never had any particular allegiance to any
place, state, town or neighborhood,'' he said. He is the only child
of peripatetic parents, his father a migrant oil-field worker.
``Our family was called oil-field trash,'' he remembers. ``We just
blew into town and we blew out of town.''
</P>
<P>
   On moving to Southern California, he says, he found ``a
wonderful warmness and sense of belonging amongst anonymous folks''
at the Long Beach Pike, an early theme park in Long Beach. He went
on to train as an architect, winning a travel scholarship to
Europe, where he discovered the Italian hill towns, ``an
architecture by nobody and everybody at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   To simulate this architecture of anonymous communality, Jerde
works ``co-creatively'' on projects with multi-disciplinary teams,
layering on references to local and global, man-made and natural
sources. His projects are not themed, he contends, but rather
capture the ``essence'' of their environments.
</P>
<P>
   Jerde is a trim man with a ruddy complexion, sandy hair and
sharp eyes, who can be an extremely engaging advocate for his
mission. But not everyone is sold.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Cantrell, the architectural writer at The Kansas City
Star, last year attacked Jerde's proposal for reinvigorating the
Kansas City downtown with streetscapes made of existing facades and
what he calls ``synchronous'' new buildings. ``For all the lofty
verbiage,'' Cantrell wrote, `` Jerde is proposing not real
architecture but a collage of facadectomies,'' adding, ``It's a
synthetic jumble, heavy on circa-1900 nostalgia, with an overlay of
shopping-mall glitz.''
</P>
<P>
   Where critics bemoan the commercialization and privatization of
civic space that his work represents, Jerde argues that ``the
public sector stopped making public space a long time ago.''
</P>
<P>
   His admirers include the Los Angeles architect Craig Hodgetts.
``Jon Jerde,'' Hodgetts writes in a forthcoming book, ``is one of
that breed of innovative architects whose contagious vision
redefines an era.'' He adds, ``His designs would, quite frankly, be
unthinkable in a world without television, modems, global brands.''
</P>
<P>
   With movie houses anchoring retail developments, and tricks of
movie-making informing his undeniably successful designs, Jerde has
become impossible to ignore. The Pritzker Prize-winning architect
Arata Isozaki has said that Frank Gehry's Guggenheim Museum in
Bilbao, Spain, and Jon Jerde's Canal City in Fukuoka, Isozaki's
birthplace, are the two most important buildings created in the
last two years.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Klein, a cultural critic and professor at the California
Institute of the Arts, believes that Jerde's work is significant
because it represents ``a transition from one notion of urban space
to another'' _ what he calls the ``metropolitan suburb.''
</P>
<P>
   Given a disappearing tax base, these kinds of malls may be a
necessity to city managers, Klein said, arguing that these
cityscapes are reflections of a latter-day Baroque mercantile
civilization, with corporations rather than popes and aristocrats
for clients.
</P>
<P>
   With his cinematic environments, Jerde's creations ``provide a
kind of camouflage under which large franchise companies can
pretend to be local,'' Klein said.
</P>
<P>
   So perhaps the Bernini comparison is apt, in another way.
Jerde's work just may express the reality of the global economy, of
a shrunken public sector, from which people may want to run. But
they cannot hide.

CONTROVERSIAL SACRIFICE BUNT LEADS TO YANKEES' DOWNFALL  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For six months, baseball lived, indeed thrived, on
offense. The Mark and Sammy show epitomized the theme of the season
and captivated the country. Well, this is the postseason, and it's
the pitchers' turn.
</P>
<P>
   In its most recent display of dominance, pitching ruled
Wednesday as the Cleveland Indians defeated the Yankees, 4-1, and
evened the American League Championship Series at one game each. If
home field advantage means anything, the Indians grabbed another
edge because the next three games will be played at Jacobs Field in
Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   The pitching on both sides was so stingy Wednesday that the
winning run scored on a play that did not involve a hit or even a
ball that was hit beyond the infield. The game-deciding play
involved a bunt, a thrown ball, a runner running where he's not
supposed to run and a mental lapse _ no, a boneheaded blunder _ by
an infielder who defied a basic rule of baseball. Instead of
following the bouncing ball, Chuck Knoblauch ignored it and decided
instead to play umpire. The only problem was the full complement of
umpires was already on the field, and they didn't ask for
Knoblauch's help.
</P>
<P>
   But for terrifically clutch pitching by David Cone in the eighth
inning, the Indians might have won the game in the regulation nine
innings. At the same time, it was outstanding pitching by
Cleveland's starter, Charles Nagy, and a complement of six
relievers that brought the Yankees back to earth and the Indians
into the 1-1 tie.
</P>
<P>
   Cone allowed only a home run by David Justice in his eight
innings of work. The Indians threatened to score at least one more
run in the eighth, but Cone snuffed out that possibility. With one
out, Omar Vizquel sliced a fly ball along the left field line, and
it eluded the diving effort of Shane Spencer, landing no more than
an inch in fair territory. It bounced toward the fence, and Vizquel
wound up at third with a triple.
</P>
<P>
   Justice and Manny Ramirez, the Indians' best hitters, were the
next two batters, but combined they didn't hit the ball 120 feet
and both were out. Justice topped the ball in front of the plate,
and Joe Girardi pounced on it and threw him out. Then Ramirez hit a
weak grounder back to the mound, and Cone threw him out.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees had tied the game the previous inning, finally
getting to Nagy for a run on a two-out double by Scott Brosius. But
Steve Reed relieved Nagy and, with runners at second and third,
induced Girardi to ground back to him for the third out.
</P>
<P>
   The game remained 1-1 until the 12th inning. Jim Thome, who had
taken called strikes three times earlier in the game, led off the
inning by rapping a single to left field. Travis Fryman then bunted
the ball hard toward first base, and first baseman Tino Martinez,
fielded the ball.
</P>
<P>
   He turned and threw to first, but the ball hit the 7 on Fryman's
back and bounded beyond first onto the dirt part of the infield.
Knoblauch, the second baseman, was covering first, but he did not
retrieve the ball. Instead he stood at first pointing at where he
thought Fryman had run from home to first.
</P>
<P>
   As television replays unequivocally showed, Fryman had run
inside the base line. The rule says the runner has to run in a lane
defined by the base line and a white line to the right of the base
line. If an umpire believes the runner has run to the left of the
base line, he is supposed to call him out for interfering with the
throw.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Hendry, the home plate umpire, made no such call.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gave me some kind of reasoning that he had to get out of
those restraining lines to touch the base and I agreed,'' said Joe
Torre, the Yankees' manager, who had disputed the call. ``But he
was never in the restraining lines. It was so blatant. It was a
terrible call. For one guy to say what he saw and for the other
guys to swear by it, and meanwhile you have it on video ...''
</P>
<P>
   Could it be considered a judgment call,'' Torre was asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not really,'' he said, ``not when you know the video is going
to embarrass you. He was on the grass all the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed the television replays showed that every step of the way
Fryman's feet landed on the grass, which is to the left of the base
line.
</P>
<P>
   All right, even if Hendry was wrong, what was Knoblauch doing?
</P>
<P>
   ``He was arguing with the umpire,'' Torre said. ``You have to
get the ball and then argue. I think he was just shocked.''
</P>
<P>
   As the ball lay untouched on the infield dirt, Enrique Wilson,
running for Thome, raced all the way home with the tie-breaking
run. Fryman reached third and later scored on Kenny Lofton's
two-run single.
</P>
<P>
   With the Yankees scoring only one run, the game was the seventh
of the postseason in which one team scored only one run. There have
been two shutouts, both by the Yankees, and seven times teams have
scored two runs, five times in winning circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   The pitchers in this game had help from Hendry's ball and strike
calls. Torre didn't think much of those either.
</P>
<P>
   ``The balls and strikes stunk,'' he said, ``but they stunk for
both sides. I've got a bunch of pictures in my pocket. You couldn't
reach some of those pitches with a bamboo stick.''

FEDERAL ANTI-BIAS SPENDING IS INADEQUATE, GROUPS SAY
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By STEVEN A. HOLMES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With President Clinton and his advisory board on
race recommending sharp increases in programs to enforce
anti-discrimination laws, civil rights groups are expressing
disappointment that Congress has approved only modest increases for
agencies like the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter sent last week to House Republican and Democratic
leaders, the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights criticized
lawmakers for not allocating more money for federal agencies that
enforce laws against discrimination in employment, housing,
education and public accommodations.
</P>
<P>
   ``For agencies that are already underbudgeted and understaffed _
and in some cases have been criticized by Congress for failing to
enforce the laws _ these inadequate appropriations will have a
cumulative and devastating effect, not only on the agencies'
efforts, but on the intended beneficiaries as well,'' the letter
said.
</P>
<P>
   The letter was signed by the heads of several civil rights
organizations; among them were Kweisi Mfume of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People, Patricia Ireland
of the National Organization for Women, Raul Yzaguirre of the
National Council of La Raza and Horace Deets of the American
Association of Retired Persons.
</P>
<P>
   Expanding federal anti-discrimination efforts was one of the
first suggestions made by the advisory board for Clinton's
initiative on race. The seven-member panel made that recommendation
at its November 1997 meeting in College Park, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Two months later, the Clinton administration announced that it
was seeking an $86 million increase in financing for the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission, the fair housing program in the
Department of Housing and Urban Development, the civil rights
division of the Department of Justice and other agencies that
investigate complaints of bias.
</P>
<P>
   So far, spending bills approved by the House and the Senate have
fallen short of the administration's request. For example, the
House has passed a $19 million increase and the Senate an $11.6
million rise in spending for the EEOC. The administration sought a
$37 million increase.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Congress approved a $10 million increase in the
budget for Housing Department's fair-housing efforts, less than
half of the $22 million increase the administration had wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Liberal civil rights leaders say Congress' unwillingness to
allocate more money to federal anti-discrimination programs is
hypocritical since many Republican lawmakers who oppose affirmative
action say what is needed is vigorous enforcement of civil rights
laws, rather than the extension of preferences to minorities and
women.

 &HT;    Today's House vote divides Democrats
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    and Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On the eve of today's vote to let the House of
Representatives open only the third presidential impeachment
inquiry ever, Rep. John Lewis of Georgia drew a line in the sand
with his own party leaders, illustrating how difficult it has been
for Democrats to reach a consensus on the historic issue.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, the Democrats' chief deputy whip, refused to help party
leaders garner support for a measure that would limit the scope and
duration of any future investigation of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said he could not in ``good conscience'' vote for such a
measure because even the Democratic proposal goes too far in
punishing the president for lying about his affair with Monica
Lewinsky, a former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will live to regret what we are about to do here,'' said
Lewis, who said he came to his decision after knocking on doors in
Atlanta and holding an ``executive session'' with himself. ``We do
not have the right to overturn the election of President Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt of
Missouri and Minority Whip David Bonior of Michigan met with fellow
Democrats to push an alternative to the Republican call for an
open-ended impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   And there was a hint Wednesday of just how open-ended that
inquiry could be.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter sent to the House Judiciary Committee, independent
counsel Kenneth Starr said ``matters continue to be under active
investigation and review by this office.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Starr wrote in his letter, ``I cannot foreclose the
possibility of providing the House of Representatives with
additional substantial and credible information arising from those
investigations that President William Jefferson Clinton committed
acts that may constitute grounds for an impeach- ment.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the day, Democrats were divided into three camps.
Some, like Lewis, oppose any impeachment inquiry at all. Others
support the Republican resolution. Others back the Democratic
alternative to limit the probe.
</P>
<P>
   The division among Democrats contrasted sharply with an unusual
unity among Republicans, who are strongly endorsing the measure
recommended by the House Judiciary Committee in a 21-16 party-line
vote Monday.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) probably will preside over
today's vote, which is expected to take place at 11 a.m. following
one hour of debate. Democrats will be allowed to show their disdain
for the Republican measure in a procedural vote, but they will not
be given a chance to amend the resolution.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution closely resembles the impeachment inquiry against
former President Nixon approved by the House in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich predicted bipartisan support for the resolution, which
calls on the House to investigate Starr's allegations that the
president committed perjury, obstructed justice and abused his
presidential powers in concealing his affair with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guess is that 420 out of 435, 430 out of 435 members will
vote in one form or another to move forward,'' Gingrich said. ``I
think that's an amazingly unanimous agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite a White House campaign to limit the inquiry and to
entice members to support a Democratic alternative, President
Clinton made an effort to distance himself from that effort on
Wednesday. Lawmakers should cast ``a vote of principle and
conscience,'' he said, on whether to approve the impeachment
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's up to others to decide what happens to me and ultimately
it's going to be up to the American people to make a clear
statement there,'' Clinton told reporters. ``More important than
anything else to me is they do the people's work and then let the
people decide where we go from here.''
</P>
<P>
   To that, Sen. Robert Byrd, senior Democrat from West Virginia,
offered some advice to the White House: ``Don't tamper with this
jury.''
</P>
<P>
   After a House Democratic caucus, it was clear that some
Democrats _ especially conservatives and those in tough re-election
races _ would vote for the Republican resolution.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans in the Georgia delegation were squarely behind
the resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Democratic Rep. Sanford Bishop said that he was still
unsure how he would vote. His constituents represent the entire
spectrum of thinking on the scandal, he said.

   ``I'm hearing a lot of comments about this back in the
district,'' Bishop said. ``Basically, a lot of people think the
president did wrong in lying, but they want him to move on issues
like terrorism, the economy and health care. They think he should
be punished, but they are not sure if impeachment is the right form
of punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   And fellow Georgia Democrat Rep. Cynthia McKinney was quiet on
how she would vote.
</P>
<P>
   But many Democrats said they would deliver a unified front today
by voting for a more limited inquiry -- even though it is destined
to fail because of the Republican majority in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim Moran (D-Va.) told a morning meeting of the Democratic
caucus he would vote for the Republican proposal after the
Democratic motion fails. Moran said he expected that three dozen of
his colleagues would follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the vote represents a partisan split, then the November
election is likely to be a referendum on the president,'' Moran
said. ``We shouldn't be afraid of the process; it's an opportunity
for the president to acquit himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans would like to pile up a bipartisan showing similar
to the 363-63 vote Sept. 11 to release Starr's allegations of
impeachable offenses.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Cairo! ... Cairo! ...'' cries the bewildered Egyptian
princess to Lord Edgar Hillcrest, the dim archeologist who has
invaded her tomb and brought her back to life after 3,500 years.
</P>
<P>
   A small world, you might think, recalling ``To Moscow, to
Moscow, to Moscow!'' and those three weepy sisters from another,
far later time and less exotic place. Yet the princess isn't
longing for the intellectual stimulus of a city that didn't even
exist when she was mummified; she is struggling to remember the
word _ and it's right on the tip of her tongue _ for the type of
doctor who treats bad backs. She finally locates the two missing
syllables: ``... practor!''
</P>
<P>
   With such irresistible gags, and with wizard performances by
Everett Quinton and Stephen DeRosa, who play all eight roles
(sometimes two simultaneously), ``The Mystery of Irma Vep,''
Charles Ludlam's 1984 Off Broadway hit, has become some kind of
sneaky all-American classic. The revival, which is at the Westside
Theater, should run as long as the actors can maintain their
breathtaking energy level.
</P>
<P>
   The director is Quinton, who costarred with Ludlam in the
original production and who, after the death of his companion and
mentor in 1987, succeeded him as the artistic director of the
Ridiculous Theatrical Company. Never having seen any Ludlam
productions, I have no idea how the Quinton work compares. From
what I have seen in the last five years, however, it is clear that
clowning of a proud and original order continues to evolve under
the direction of Quinton.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of his work has been equally successful. There was a
severely cut-down version of ``A Midsummer Night's Dream'' that
didn't know whether or not it wanted to be funny. Yet there were
also a hysterically comic sendup of ``Carmen,'' with the
knobby-kneed Quinton playing the title role, often with a
long-stemmed rose clenched between two rows of numerous teeth, and
``Movieland,'' a crowd-pleasing, one-man extravaganza with Quinton
as your generic camp movie goddess.
</P>
<P>
   The production that has haunted me the most, however, is
``Phedre,'' which Quinton played more or less straight. It made
most members of the audience, who had come to roar with laughter,
increasingly uncomfortable, which is the way I feel when Robin
Williams plays straight-from-the-heart damp-eyed sentimentality.
</P>
<P>
   But Quinton is something quite other: a post-modern Groucho Marx
who challenges his audience, not with insults but with a whoopee
cushion full of Racine. His Phedre wasn't a camp grotesque. She was
a doomed queen who looked like a truck driver in drag, whose
presentation of the lines was such that you heard every one of them
as if for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   This was burlesque on behalf of the kind of high culture most
post-modernists couldn't care less about. The performance was
difficult to characterize, other than it was an extremely strange
and brave occasion.
</P>
<P>
   The traditions of the Ridiculous Theatrical Company, which has
not had a recent production after losing its lease on its Greenwich
Village playhouse several years ago, continue with this superlative
new commercial staging of ``The Mystery of Irma Vep,'' subtitled
``A Penny Dreadful,'' for which movies are the principal
inspirations.
</P>
<P>
   Its provenance is long and respectable: ``Rebecca,'' ``The Hound
of the Baskervilles,'' ``Frankenstein'' and ``Dracula'' (and their
various Hammer Films spinoffs), all movies about mummies and
werewolves, ``Laura,'' ``Angel Street'' and just about anything
with Joan Crawford in her twilight years.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, of course, there was ``Les Vampires,'' Louis
Feuillade's grand, 10-part French serial made in 1915-16, which
gave us the character name of Irma Vep. The 1966 French film ``Irma
Vep'' has no relation to the Ludlam play, which defies plagiarism
and any other kind of literary larceny.
</P>
<P>
   Ludlam's setting is Mandacrest, the Hillcrest family's great
ancestral home, to which Lord Edgar (DeRosa) has brought his new
bride, Lady Enid ( Quinton).
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately, Mandacrest's past closes in on the spirited
but sensitive and affectionate Enid. A palpable presence, as well
as a ghastly portrait in the drawing room, is Lady Irma Vep,
Edgar's first wife, who died under mysterious circumstances. There
are also stories of the tragic death of Edgar's young son, Victor,
fatally attacked by Irma's pet wolf, also called Victor. The house
seems to be staffed by ghosts, vampires and werewolves, who make
unreliable servants.
</P>
<P>
   Movies may be the inspiration for ``The Mystery of Irma Vep,''
but the script and, particularly, the performances move far beyond
camp to achieve a kind of overview that effortlessly embraces
nearly a century of American show business.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mystery of Irma Vep'' recalls burlesque, vaudeville,
Broadway farce of the 1920s and 30s, as well as the Golden Age of
Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the joy in this production is witnessing the
split-second timing of Quinton and DeRosa as they switch back and
forth among their various characters, exiting through one door in
mid-speech to enter a beat later via another door as someone else.
A scene of signal bliss: We watch through French doors at the back
of the stage while poor Enid is cruelly ravished by a hairy
creature, part-man, part-beast, who is also played by Quinton.
</P>
<P>
   William Ivey Long is formally listed as the costume designer
but, because of the speed with which the costume changes are
effected, he might be more accurately described as the costume
engineer. There is no time to put them on; they must be walked
into, and they aren't flimsy little shmattes.
</P>
<P>
   Quinton's Enid wears gorgeously overelaborate Edwardian gowns
that look as big and heavy as horse blankets, and are almost as
becoming. His getup as the Egyptian princess would seem to require
equal attention in the donning and doffing, simply because there's
so little to it.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   This is the sort of illusion _ sometimes called magic _ that is
possible only in the theater, where the audience realizes that such
speedy transformations are close to miraculous. When they are
successful, as they are here, they have the effect of elevating the
entire theatrical experience into a sort of flying carpet ride that
happens to be very, very funny.
</P>
<P>
   John Lee Beatty's sets are also part of the fun, especially the
great Mandacrest drawing room, which looks as pinched, tacky and
basic as elegant English drawing rooms always do in B-pictures. I
assume that far more money was spent on this production than the
Ridiculous Theatrical Company could ever afford for its productions
downtown, but don't worry: nobody has sold out.
</P>
<P>
   DeRosa, who was memorably funny in the Acting Company's ``Love's
Fire,'' seen in New York in June, works beautifully with Quinton,
especially as the numbingly dense Lord Edgar. He also appears as
Jane Twisden, the ladies' maid who, like Mrs. Danvers in
``Rebecca,'' resents her new mistress, whom she dismisses as ``a
vulgarian,'' and whom she tricks into wearing _ gasp, gasp _ the
wrong gown!
</P>
<P>
   DeRosa gets to deliver some of the author's most delicious
high-calorie lines about love's being ``a kind of madness'' and
hatred ``a bottomless cup.'' Will Jane Twisden drink the dregs? I
dasn't tell.
</P>
<P>
   As the director, the star and the keeper of the Ludlam flame,
Quinton continues to be one of the most singular talents in the
contemporary American theater. His Lady Enid is demanding, rude,
passionate and forgiving. Though his Egyptian princess is not quite
as beautiful as the mummy case she comes in, she is both properly
imperious and willfully dismissive of her benefactor. Quinton is
also not at all bad as a wolfman.
</P>
<P>
   His secret is that he plays his wildly cartoonish characters
absolutely straight, never for a minute betraying the material by
winking at the audience, which would be fatal. Because he is such a
tough, disciplined performer, he makes it all look easy. You leave
the theater full of good will, walking on air. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>

<P>
   That sense of sublime weightlessness is what is missing from
``Communicating Doors,'' Alan Ayckbourn's comedy now playing Off
Broadway at the Variety Arts Theater. The English playwright
probably knows more about play-making than anyone in the theater
today, with the exception of Neil Simon.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in this New York production, directed by Christopher Ashley,
``Communicating Doors'' seems too clever for its own good. That is,
it takes so long to set up the complicated central situation that
you may have forgotten exactly what it is by the time the payoffs
start coming along.
</P>
<P>
   The setting is an elegant London hotel suite where, by chance, a
most improbably innocent prostitute-dominatrix, who calls herself
Poopay, is summoned, not for her usual services, but to witness the
bizarre confession of a very old man. The year is 2018. The old man
claims to have ordered the murders of his two wives, the first 40
years earlier, the second 20 years later.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to get away from the murderer, Poopay runs into the next
room. By playwriting magic, she finds herself in the same suite in
1998, confronted by the woman who is scheduled to be the second of
the old man's victims, and on this very day. After a lot more
exposition, the two women set out to change the course of history,
even skipping back to 1978 to try and save the wife who was the
first to be bumped off.
</P>
<P>
   You see what I mean? Any comedy that takes this long to outline
is not going to fly without a lot of auxiliary power. Among other
things, Ayckbourn puts forth too many arbitrary rules relating to
time travel to allow the farcical situations to erupt
spontaneously.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of ``Communicating Doors'' I experienced the sinking
feeling I sometimes had in college when, after a lecture, I
realized I remembered nothing and faced a pop quiz. It's not
comedy; it's Theater of Cruelty.
</P>
<P>
   There are some comic moments in ``Communicating Doors'' but
ultimately they don't add up to much. The one bright spot:
Mary-Louise Parker, who plays Poopay. She's a charmer. Even in her
leather drag and brandishing a very small, limp whip, Ms. Parker
looks so cute, cuddly and innocent she wouldn't be out of place
walking our recently saved 42nd Street.  &QL;

WHY IT TAKES 400 PAGES TO TELL YOU WHAT'S ON  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 11) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 Jeff MacGregor worked in the television industry for 20 years as
writer, producer and network correspondent.  
 By JEFF MACGREGOR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If, as Emily Dickinson says, hope is the thing with feathers
that perches in the soul, then maybe boredom is the thing in a
bathrobe that just sits around the house. It is, in any case, my
only excuse for the amazing statistical discoveries that follow.
</P>
<P>
   Finishing work the other day and having no rooftop orchidarium
in which to putter (as famous writers do) or even a basement
workshop in which to muse among the wood shavings (as midlist
writers do), I went downstairs to get the mail. There, to my
delight, I found the fall preview issue of TV Guide. An hour later,
with the help of two passing stevedores, a hand truck and a hoist,
I had the 398-page booklet safely home.
</P>
<P>
   Which put me in mind of several questions. First: Why is TV
Guide so big? Second: Is ``orchidarium'' even a word? What about
``orchidaceum''? Would either be on a rooftop? And why are writers
always writing about the smell of the wood shavings in their
basement workshops? What are they making down there? Is it a
metaphor? A simile? A spice rack? What is Joseph Conrad really
trying to say in ``Heart of Darkness''? Discuss.
</P>
<P>
   Regaining consciousness a few hours later, I made scientific
measurements of the bloated little television fanzine in an effort
to answer my initial question. At 7.375 inches long by 5 inches
wide by 3/4 of an inch thick, it weighed just over 10 ounces.
</P>
<P>
   TV Guide has a national circulation of around 13 million. This
means that the total weight, countrywide, of the fall preview issue
(despite reported advertising declines) was roughly 8.125 million
pounds: more than 4,000 tons. Stacked flat, they would form a tower
153.8 miles high; balanced lengthwise, 1,513 miles. Most
fascinating of all, if every page from every issue were laid end to
end, (italics)most of the new television shows they describe would
still be gone by Christmas.(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   One of the few traditions left in the television programming
business is the premiere of new shows each fall. Since the advent
of cable and satellite distribution, the addition of quasi-networks
like UPN and the WB, and the dispersal of the old network audience
across a wide range of other interests and technologies, there is
no longer a fixed schedule for the debut of new product.
</P>
<P>
   Shows pop up on the prime-time schedule year round now, each one
vying to find an audience, fast, in a world of hairtrigger remotes
and short attention spans.
</P>
<P>
   Time slots are rearranged from week to week to reward the strong
or cull the puny, to catch a trend or break a story or fight a
holding action until reinforcements arrive. ``For the love of God,
we need that third-to-last episode of `Seinfeld' down here again or
we're done for!''
</P>
<P>
   The beginning of the fall season, though, is still the best way
to get shows out of the gate. The children are back in school,
vacation time is pretty much over, and the audience is looking for
something fresh after a summer of reruns and one-off stunt shows
(``World's Wildest Police Animals Chase Rampaging Guinness Record
Holders'').
</P>
<P>
   Besides, baby boomers like me were long ago conditioned to
anticipate new shows with this change of seasons, and programmers
are loath to give up one of the few remaining habits of a shifting
audience.
</P>
<P>
   Since there is nothing new under the sun, or at least under the
Hollywood sign, this fall we are again reassured in our various
tastes by the scientifically researched diversity of network
offerings: Drama/sitcom. White collar/blue collar.
Married/divorced. Kids/no kids. Home/workplace. Blonde/brunette.
Lovable oddball/laughable martinet.
</P>
<P>
   Endlessly recombinant, these are the DNA strands of nightly
network entertainment. Newly discovered this year is the gene that
determines whether one lead character per show will be perceptibly
gay. The prime-time news-magazine program, an inexpensive catch-all
mutation of the last several seasons, has been cloned successfully
and will continue to provide us with a happy/sad, black/white,
hero/villain perspective on things out there in the real world. It
is, in other words, a fall season like other recent fall seasons.
</P>
<P>
   But if all shows are basically identical, even at the molecular
level (and with a notable handful of exceptions, they are), how do
we differentiate them? How do we know if the lovable oddballs in
``Will and Grace'' are better than/worse than/the same as the
lovable oddballs in ``Dharma and Greg'' or the lovable oddballs in
``Two Guys, a Girl and a Pizza Place''? Or if blond, blue-collar
``Costello'' is better than/worse than/the same as blond,
blue-collar ``Jesse''?
</P>
<P>
   That's where a hyperthyroid copy of TV Guide comes in handy.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is that television shows from season to season vary so
little (ritual formats performed by actors recycled from other
ritual formats) that the promotion of public awareness of any given
show has as much to do with the show's initial success as its
content. (Long term, of course, a show has to become a habit, like
crack, to succeed.)
</P>
<P>
   That's why network ad campaigns are generally more entertaining
(and expensive and important) than the shows they advertise. It is
also why the multibillion-dollar industry that reports on the
business of show business has grown ever larger over the last
decade.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Your TV Guide is lately the size of a regional phone book
because of the necessary symbiosis between the covered and the
coverage. It is in TV Guide's own best interests that more people
watch television, so they present as much enticing information
about it as you can lift.
</P>
<P>
   It is in network television's best interests to cooperate with
TV Guide (and buy lots of ad space), because it may be the last
place a viewer looks before making a programming choice. This is a
simple transaction in which both parties benefit from the continued
success of the other.
</P>
<P>
   It also provides a model for the now complex macroeconomy that
fuels other infotainment magazines like Entertainment Weekly and
television shows like ``Entertainment Tonight,'' ``Extra!'' and
``Access Hollywood.''
</P>
<P>
   Taken in themselves, these outlets satisfy the public appetite
for ``behind the scenes'' information about the shows we watch, the
movies we see and the music we hear. By selecting certain shows for
their attentions, they momentarily clear away some of the clutter
so that choices seem to become easier.
</P>
<P>
   They create curiosity. (``If I'm seeing it on `E.T.' it must be
worthwhile so I'll sample it.'') They also play to our love of
competition, wherein box office receipts and weekly ratings
determine in large part our impression of the product's quality.
(``If such and such finished 65th it must not be very good so I
won't try it'' becomes self-fulfilling.) Thus they become the touts
and handicappers for a race that never ends.
</P>
<P>
   At the next level of complexity, these outlets create the
appetite they strive to satisfy. In a society that long ago
replaced myth with the prurient/cautionary tales of celebrity,
where nothing is truly ``behind'' the scenes because it's all
available at all times, the more celebrities that the E! channel
manufactures, the more celebrities they'll have to cover. This,
then, is also the world's first working perpetual-motion machine.
</P>
<P>
   Most sinister, though, is the fact that these outlets are owned
and operated by the same gigantic media combines that own, produce
and distribute the entertainment. When ``Entertainment Tonight''
shows night after night of reports about ``Titanic'' for months, is
it because that movie inherently deserves our attention? Or is it
because ``ET'' is owned by Paramount, a studio with a 50 percent
interest in the movie's revenues?
</P>
<P>
   To the casual consumer of entertainment, it's almost impossible
to discern the linkages between product and promoter. Until
recently, for example, TV Guide was owned by the News Corp., Rupert
Murdoch's umbrella for his global communications company. News
Corp. also owns 20th Century Fox. And the Fox network.
</P>
<P>
   Does that account then for the substantial number of decorative
cover stories over the last few seasons devoted to ``The Simpsons''
and ``The X-Files''? What about a show like ``The Practice,'' which
was the subject of a cover story last season slugged ``the best
show you're not watching''? But that's on the ABC network, you say.
Yes, it is. But it's produced by the Fox studio, 20th Century Fox
Television.
</P>
<P>
   This kind of interdivisional logrolling has been the status quo
for some time. All the public can do in its own defense is become
more aware of the manipulation they're subject to, to who owns what
and why they might want you to watch one thing instead of another.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us back to the fall season and the arrival of those
Proustian TV Guides. They're your 4,000-ton tip sheet to the great
autumn network sweepstakes, a handy listing to another year's worth
of derivative long shots and formulaic dark horses.
</P>
<P>
   And if that sounds like induction day at the glue factory, it
should, because historically and statistically we know that most of
the new entries will be out of the running in the next few months.
Some will falter in weeks. A few (``Encore! Encore!'' limps to
mind) will be humanely euthanized before they can do any further
harm to themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Programming anything in the face of circumstances like these is
an act of faith as much as calculation. Network television
executives ply their trade at the complex intersection of corporate
hope and national boredom. And in millennium Hollywood, hope is the
thing with legs and the time slot opposite ``ER.'' Emily Dickinson
would be so proud.

MAKING ART THAT LASTS OF THEATER THAT DOESN'T  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 11) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MEL GUSSOW   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Paul Davis' theater posters, one can see the essence of the
original performance: the arrogant charm of Raul Julia's Mack the
Knife in ``Threepenny Opera,'' Sam Waterston crying out his rage in
``Hamlet,'' the Orientalized elegance of Irene Worth in ``The
Cherry Orchard'' and the full range of Kevin Kline's virtuosity as
Hamlet, Richard III and the Pirate King in ``The Pirates of
Penzance. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As an artist, Davis made his reputation with these posters and
others he drew for Joseph Papp during the heyday of the New York
Shakespeare Festival in the 1970s and 1980s. Sitting in his East
Village studio, surrounded by examples of his work, he recalled a
Papp prediction: ``He said that someday all that will be left of
these plays will be the posters.''
</P>
<P>
   Although those portraits remain at the core of his art, Davis
has produced an astonishing variety of work, political as well as
theatrical and cinematic, including covers for news magazine and
books, murals and advertising layouts.
</P>
<P>
   A hearty sampling from all stages of his 40-year career is on
exhibit through Oct. 30 at the School of Visual Arts in Manhattan.
The pictures in the exhibition, about 200 items drawn from the
collection of Davis and his family, include figure drawings he made
during his residency last year in Italy as a Prix de Rome winner.
</P>
<P>
   They are, of course, signed with his distinctive, carefully
curlicued signature. Davis, a graduate of Visual Arts, is an
instructor at the school and, at 60, is this year's recipient of
its Master Series Award.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever possible, Davis has drawn from life. Kline, the most
frequent subject of Davis pictures, would come to his studio and
perform scenes from the plays while the artist photographed him in
action. Then, using the photographs as a guide, Davis made his
drawings.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes he has had to work at a distance, especially when
doing political figures. Naturally Che Guevera did not pose for
Davis' posthumous portrait. When he drew Nelson Mandela for a Time
magazine cover, the subject was still in prison; Davis had to draw
from old photographs and from Winnie Mandela's description. She
would tell him things like ``he has pain in his eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   How did he paint pain? Through instinct and with painterly
technique. Although he has done still lifes and landscapes, like a
70-foot mural of the seasons for the Arcadia restaurant on the
Upper East Side (removed after the restaurant's recent closing), he
specializes in portraits of people.
</P>
<P>
   He has been drawing faces since he was a child in Tulsa, Okla.
The title of his 1985 book was ``Faces,'' the faces ranging from
Papp as a swaggering song and dance man (with cigar) to early
portraits of the Kennedy brothers, looking extraordinarily youthful
_ and thoughtful.
</P>
<P>
   One key to his portraits is in the eyes. A face, he said, can be
immobile, but you can see ``the life of a person through their
eyes.'' Often, as in his painting of Laurence Olivier as King Lear,
the eyes have a searing intensity, as if the actor were staring
right through the viewer of the picture. Or in the case of Jack
Nicholson, the eyes signal mischief.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to artists like Al Hirschfeld who work with line,
Davis paints in color with brush strokes. ``I always felt the need
for light and shade,'' he said. He describes his work as
``illusionistic,'' and it is filled with allegories and symbolism:
the Rolling Stones as stones rolling down a hill; Darryl F. Zanuck
as the logo of 20th Century Fox, with starlets in his sunglasses
and a dollar sign in his cigar smoke.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was Picasso who said most good portraits have a lot of
caricature in them,'' Davis recalled. ``You're trying to represent
people, but you're also trying to enlarge on those aspects that
make them more like themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   From his perspective, ``A true poster is meant for the street,''
he said. ``The whole point is to get somebody to do something _ a
call for action.'' By definition it is political. A theater poster
is intended to sell tickets, an advertising poster is intended to
sell a product, and ``a political poster is supposed to make you
aware of an issue or a candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, in the right hands the poster is, of course,
an individual work of art, which is one reason Davis shies from
being called an illustrator. As he said: ``Illustrations are made
to accompany something _ a text. A lot of the work I've done is
meant to stand on its own, as itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, he objects to the distinction made between high and
low art. He prefers to make distinctions between good and bad art.
That difference is not always accurately defined by those who
commission the art. Some of his strongest pictures have been
rejected by magazines for various editorial reasons. He is
undeterred by that fact: he has the portrait to show for it _ and
also a healthy fee.
</P>
<P>
   Davis also sells his drawings for around $1,500, his paintings
for as much as $40,000. Occasionally he does private portraits on
commission. Although he has galleries handling his work in other
countries _ two in Japan and one in Italy _ he is not represented
in New York. He handles his own sales, and his work sells well.
</P>
<P>
   With enthusiasm, he often paints on surfaces other than canvas:
his Ralph Nader is on a shopping bag, Dr. Spock on a baby bottle,
both Madonna and Ronald Reagan on blocks of woods. Wood, in fact,
is one of Davis' favorite surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard, but it absorbs the paint,'' he said. He concedes
that women are more difficult to paint than men. ``Sharp edges are
easier to paint than soft edges,'' he said. ``Craggy is easier to
do. I've always tried to paint beautiful women.''
</P>
<P>
   In a book that describes 25 outstanding American illustrators,
he lists more than 50 people who had a great effect on his work.
The list includes ``Miss Ownby,'' his eighth-grade art teacher in
Oklahoma; Silas Rhodes, the head of the School of Visual Arts,
which he attended on a scholarship; Milton Glaser and Seymour
Chwast, who gave him his first job at their Pushpin studio,
enabling him to paint rather than having to support himself by
teaching.
</P>
<P>
   As he said, ``First you succeed, then you teach.'' Also in the
pantheon are Marcel Duchamp (the influence of Surrealism), Mark
Twain, several Japanese painters, Balthus and Giotto (his two
favorite artists) and Walt Kelly, the creator of Pogo.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining his fondness for Kelly, Davis said he had started out
wanting to be a cartoonist. ``If I could have been Walt Kelly or Al
Capp or Chester Gould, I would have been delighted,'' he said.
``But I had to settle for something else.''
</P>
<P>
   Cartooning appeals to the storytelling side of his art. Despite
the apparent pictorial realism of his work, it is, he said, ``more
fanciful than a photograph,''
</P>
<P>
   In his spare time, he still occasionally tries to draw cartoons
and has become an expert at computer animation, examples of which
can be seen in the exhibiton. Calling up one of his abstract shorts
on a computer screen, he demonstrated the transformative power of
this process.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly a Paul Davis cartoon morphed into a Picasso _ and then
just as quickly returned to a Davis, and seemed to dance around the
screen. It was the animation equivalent of a jazz improvisation,
adding an extra dimension to the artist's visceral sense of
theater.

WHITE HOUSE PRESSES WAVERING DEMOCRATS FOR SUPPORT ON EVE OF
IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY VOTE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On the eve of a historic House vote to launch an
impeachment inquiry against President Clinton, the White House
pressed Wednesday to line up support from wavering Democrats
worried about re-election.
</P>
<P>
   With the Republican-controlled House certain to formally open an
impeachment investigation into his effort to cover-up an affair
with Monica Lewinsky, a key issue for Clinton was whether enough
Democrats would defect to allow the GOP to slap a bipartisan label
on the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   To help keep defections to a minimum, key House Democrats worked
late Wednesday on an alternative to the open-ended investigation
proposed by the Republicans and negotiated with the House GOP
leadership for additional time to debate the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's up to others to decide what happens to me, and ultimately
it's going to be up to the American people to make a clear
statement there,'' Clinton said while posing for photographers with
visiting Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban.
</P>
<P>
   The president, who acknowledged talking by telephone with
several Democrats, denied asking anyone to flatly oppose an
inquiry. Clinton said House members should cast a ``vote of
principle and conscience.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Vice President Al Gore, first lady Hillary
Rodham Clinton and White House aides continued urging House
Democrats to oppose the Republican plan for an open-ended
impeachment inquiry. The plan comes up for a vote today.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile independent counsel Ken Starr delivered a letter
Wednesday to the House warning that his investigation of the
Whitewater land deal, alleged misuse of FBI files and the White
House travel office was not completed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can confirm at this time that matters continue to be under
active investigation and review,'' Starr wrote, responding to a
request from Judiciary Committee leaders. He said he could not
``foreclose the possibility'' of submitting to Congress evidence of
impeachable offenses beyond material already provided about
Clinton's affair with Lewinsky and attempts to cover it up.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's letter is expected to undercut Democratic efforts _
which already face overwhelming opposition from the House
Republican majority _ to put a time limit on the Judiciary
Committee's impeachment inquiry or to restrict it to the Lewinsky
matter.
</P>
<P>
   House Democratic leaders dispatched Rep. Vic Fazio, D-Calif., a
retiring member of Congress, to the White House to tell the
president's strategists that wavering Democrats wanted them to back
off.
</P>
<P>
   Fazio also gave the president the latest headcount on Democrats
likely to support the GOP impeachment proposal if a Democratic
alternative, which was still being drafted late Wednesday, is
defeated as expected.
</P>
<P>
   When the Democrats vote with the Republicans, Fazio said, ``they
do so with a great deal of skepticism on one hand, but at the same
time a sense that in their case, either because of strong personal
views or constituent pressures, that that's the right thing to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   The best estimate, provided late Wednesday by two top Democratic
strategists, was that about 50 House Democrats, nearly one-fourth
of the members, will defect. If that happens, it will undercut the
White House claim that the investigation is a partisan witch hunt.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with polls showing that Democrats would not be hurt by
standing with the president against an open-ended impeachment
inquiry, the White House rebuffed requests from a small group of
moderate Democrats to radically change course and quit opposing the
Republican proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim Moran, D-Va., said that if the vote today breaks down
along partisan lines ``the November election is likely to be a
referendum on the president's conduct.'' That, he added, is not in
the ``long-term best interests of the Democratic Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats would be better served, Moran said, if the election
turns on issues such as education, health care and the future of
Social Security. He said the president should let Democrats off the
hook on the issue of an open inquiry. ``The president should seize
this as an opportunity to take dramatic action worthy of a true
leader, to say: `This problem is not of your making, it is mine.
None of you should suffer because of this. I'm going to take on my
accuser. I'm going to acquit myself.' ''
</P>
<P>
   A Democratic House leader said that suggestion was declined
several times in the past week by the Clintons.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., rebuked the White House
for efforts over the weekend to derail the impeachment inquiry by
asking 34 Democratic senators to sign a letter saying they would
never vote to remove the president. ``I would suggest by way of
friendly advice to the White House: Don't tamper with this jury,''
Byrd said during a speech on the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican proposal sets no time limits on the investigation
and would allow the House Judiciary Committee to expand the inquiry
beyond Lewinsky matter to other issues, such as Whitewater, alleged
misuse of FBI files, White House travel office firings and campaign
fund-raising abuses.
</P>
<P>
   The limits on duration and scope are key ingredients in the
alternative Democrats will offer when the impeachment inquiry
resolution is debated. Under House rules, each side is allowed 30
minutes to argue the resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Late Wednesday, Democratic leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri
asked Speaker Newt Gingrich to allow up to eight hours of debate on
the Republican resolution and the Democratic alternative. The GOP
leadership responded with an offer to allow each side an hour to
debate, which Democrats quickly criticized.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm frankly appalled,'' said Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, a
Houston Democrat who warned that Republicans could face a backlash
from voters if they ``close the shades of the United States
Congress, turn off the lights ... and not allow a full and fair
debate.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Chet Edwards, D-Waco, said the vote to launch an
impeachment inquiry is the most important decision Congress can
make short of declaring war. ``Why should we have to beg for the
time needed to let members speak on this issue?'' Edwards asked.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Boehner, R-Ohio and chairman of the House Republican
Conference, argued for limiting debate to an hour and not changing
the rules. ``It is typical of Bill Clinton and the Democrats that
they believe the rules apply to everyone but them.''
</P>
<P>
   After the House approves the impeachment inquiry Thursday,
members will close shop and return to their home districts.
Technically, the House will be recessed pending a call from the
Speaker to return if the Judiciary Committee votes to recommend
impeaching the president.
</P>
<P>
   The committee, chaired by Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., is likely
begin its investigation after the Nov. 3 elections. The committee
will interrogate witnesses, including Lewinsky and, in all
likelihood, Starr.
</P>
<P>
   If a majority of the 21 Republicans and 16 Democrats on the
committee decide there is enough evidence to impeach Clinton, they
will ask for a vote before the full House. If the House approves,
the president will go on trial in the Senate, probably next year.
If he is found guilty by 67 or more senators, he will be removed
from office.
</P>
<P>
   The House has returned articles of impeachment against two
presidents _ Richard Nixon, who resigned in 1974 before he could be
tried, and Andrew Johnson, who was acquitted by the Senate in
1868. &QL;

MARTINEZ SPUTTERING THROUGH ANOTHER OCTOBER  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By JACK CURRY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Dave Winfield tossed out the first pitch before David
Cone threw one Wednesday, which was a bizarre sight at Yankee
Stadium. George Steinbrenner once hired a known gambler to collect
disparaging information on the former Yankee. Verbal squabbles and
lawsuits followed and there has been a deep freeze in the
relationship between the owner and the future Hall of Famer,
although that is apparently thawing.
</P>
<P>
   While Winfield's presence was mostly irrelevant, there was one
way to twist and turn and make it somewhat relevant. Steinbrenner
once criticized Winfield by calling him Mr. May after he failed to
produce in the 1981 World Series. It was a cruel moniker and
Winfield was basically stuck with it until he helped the Blue Jays
win the 1992 World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner has never even come remotely close to maligning
Tino Martinez, a player he adores. But Martinez is sputtering
through another October, leaving no doubt about his inability to
mimic Reggie Jackson's postseason exploits and leaving a void in
the middle of a disappointing lineup. Would Steinbrenner ever
seethe enough to call Martinez something as ugly as Mr. May? After
Wednesday's 4-1 loss to the Indians in Game 2 of the American
League Championship Series and with Steinbrenner, anything is
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez had another long October day and October evening at
Yankee Stadium, going hitless in five times at-bat and stranding
three runners. He had a marvelous opportunity to knock in the
go-ahead run in the eighth, but he swung wildly at Paul Shuey's 3-2
pitch and left teammates perched on first and second. Mr. October
Martinez is not.
</P>
<P>
   Poor Martinez was also involved in a controversial play that
helped the Indians gain a wild victory over the Yankees in 12
innings. Enrique Wilson scored the second run from first base after
Martinez fielded Travis Fryman's bunt, threw it to first and it
glanced off the runner's back and rolled away. Chuck Knoblauch
argued that Fryman was out of the baseline and inexplicably did not
chase the loose ball. It dribbled toward the outfield grass because
of Knoblauch's brain lock and that allowed Wilson to barely beat
Knoblauch's throw with a dive across plate.
</P>
<P>
   The postseason has not been Martinez's favorite time with the
Yankees, even though they won the World Series in 1996. Actually,
Martinez's struggles date to the ALCS in 1995. Ever since Martinez
batted .409 with one homer and five runs batted in for the Mariners
against the Yankees in the 1995 Division Series, he is 19 for 108
with one homer and four RBIs. In the ALCS, Martinez is 7-for-53 and
in the last seven postseason series, he has not had a homer or an
RBI in six of them.
</P>
<P>
   Since Martinez is a sensitive sort, Joe Torre turned defensive
when he was asked about Martinez's disappearing offense. Torre
spoke eloquently on Tuesday about Bernie Williams being 0 for 11 in
the Division Series against the Rangers, offering some insights and
speculating that Williams was trying too hard because the
postseason can be fatal.
</P>
<P>
   But Torre was not so talkative about Martinez. He was not
talkative at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tino's fine,'' said Torre, who then asserted that he counted
David Justice's nifty diving catch in left field on Tuesday as a
hit for Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   Even if that had been a hit, it would have been a bloop single.
Martinez would have taken one of those in Game 2. He would have
taken anything. Martinez rapped out to first in the second and,
with a runner on second base and one out in the fourth, he popped
out to left. After walking on four pitches in the seventh, Martinez
had a chance to erase some of the postseason frustration.
</P>
<P>
   With the score tied, 2-2, Williams was on first, Derek Jeter was
on second and Mariano Rivera was warming up for the ninth. If
Martinez managed to get a single, it would have given the Yankees a
lead and given Rivera a chance for a save. But Martinez never
looked comfortable, probably should have whiffed on a close 2-2
curveball and then missed a 3-2 pitch to kill another threat.

MAKING ART THAT LASTS OF THEATER THAT DOESN'T  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 11) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MEL GUSSOW   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Paul Davis' theater posters, one can see the essence of the
original performance: the arrogant charm of Raul Julia's Mack the
Knife in ``Threepenny Opera,'' Sam Waterston crying out his rage in
``Hamlet,'' the Orientalized elegance of Irene Worth in ``The
Cherry Orchard'' and the full range of Kevin Kline's virtuosity as
Hamlet, Richard III and the Pirate King in ``The Pirates of
Penzance. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As an artist, Davis made his reputation with these posters and
others he drew for Joseph Papp during the heyday of the New York
Shakespeare Festival in the 1970s and 1980s. Sitting in his East
Village studio, surrounded by examples of his work, he recalled a
Papp prediction: ``He said that someday all that will be left of
these plays will be the posters.''
</P>
<P>
   Although those portraits remain at the core of his art, Davis
has produced an astonishing variety of work, political as well as
theatrical and cinematic, including covers for news magazine and
books, murals and advertising layouts.
</P>
<P>
   A hearty sampling from all stages of his 40-year career is on
exhibit through Oct. 30 at the School of Visual Arts in Manhattan.
The pictures in the exhibition, about 200 items drawn from the
collection of Davis and his family, include figure drawings he made
during his residency last year in Italy as a Prix de Rome winner.
</P>
<P>
   They are, of course, signed with his distinctive, carefully
curlicued signature. Davis, a graduate of Visual Arts, is an
instructor at the school and, at 60, is this year's recipient of
its Master Series Award.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever possible, Davis has drawn from life. Kline, the most
frequent subject of Davis pictures, would come to his studio and
perform scenes from the plays while the artist photographed him in
action. Then, using the photographs as a guide, Davis made his
drawings.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes he has had to work at a distance, especially when
doing political figures. Naturally Che Guevera did not pose for
Davis' posthumous portrait. When he drew Nelson Mandela for a Time
magazine cover, the subject was still in prison; Davis had to draw
from old photographs and from Winnie Mandela's description. She
would tell him things like ``he has pain in his eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   How did he paint pain? Through instinct and with painterly
technique. Although he has done still lifes and landscapes, like a
70-foot mural of the seasons for the Arcadia restaurant on the
Upper East Side (removed after the restaurant's recent closing), he
specializes in portraits of people.
</P>
<P>
   He has been drawing faces since he was a child in Tulsa, Okla.
The title of his 1985 book was ``Faces,'' the faces ranging from
Papp as a swaggering song and dance man (with cigar) to early
portraits of the Kennedy brothers, looking extraordinarily youthful
_ and thoughtful.
</P>
<P>
   One key to his portraits is in the eyes. A face, he said, can be
immobile, but you can see ``the life of a person through their
eyes.'' Often, as in his painting of Laurence Olivier as King Lear,
the eyes have a searing intensity, as if the actor were staring
right through the viewer of the picture. Or in the case of Jack
Nicholson, the eyes signal mischief.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to artists like Al Hirschfeld who work with line,
Davis paints in color with brush strokes. ``I always felt the need
for light and shade,'' he said. He describes his work as
``illusionistic,'' and it is filled with allegories and symbolism:
the Rolling Stones as stones rolling down a hill; Darryl F. Zanuck
as the logo of 20th Century Fox, with starlets in his sunglasses
and a dollar sign in his cigar smoke.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was Picasso who said most good portraits have a lot of
caricature in them,'' Davis recalled. ``You're trying to represent
people, but you're also trying to enlarge on those aspects that
make them more like themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   From his perspective, ``A true poster is meant for the street,''
he said. ``The whole point is to get somebody to do something _ a
call for action.'' By definition it is political. A theater poster
is intended to sell tickets, an advertising poster is intended to
sell a product, and ``a political poster is supposed to make you
aware of an issue or a candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, in the right hands the poster is, of course,
an individual work of art, which is one reason Davis shies from
being called an illustrator. As he said: ``Illustrations are made
to accompany something _ a text. A lot of the work I've done is
meant to stand on its own, as itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, he objects to the distinction made between high and
low art. He prefers to make distinctions between good and bad art.
That difference is not always accurately defined by those who
commission the art. Some of his strongest pictures have been
rejected by magazines for various editorial reasons. He is
undeterred by that fact: he has the portrait to show for it _ and
also a healthy fee.
</P>
<P>
   Davis also sells his drawings for around $1,500, his paintings
for as much as $40,000. Occasionally he does private portraits on
commission. Although he has galleries handling his work in other
countries _ two in Japan and one in Italy _ he is not represented
in New York. He handles his own sales, and his work sells well.
</P>
<P>
   With enthusiasm, he often paints on surfaces other than canvas:
his Ralph Nader is on a shopping bag, Dr. Spock on a baby bottle,
both Madonna and Ronald Reagan on blocks of woods. Wood, in fact,
is one of Davis' favorite surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard, but it absorbs the paint,'' he said. He concedes
that women are more difficult to paint than men. ``Sharp edges are
easier to paint than soft edges,'' he said. ``Craggy is easier to
do. I've always tried to paint beautiful women.''
</P>
<P>
   In a book that describes 25 outstanding American illustrators,

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton on Tuesday gave House members
public leeway to ``cast a vote of principle and conscience'' on a
Republican-drafted impeachment inquiry on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But Democratic leaders polished an alternative proposal designed
to draw as many party members as possible away from the Republican
plan to authorize a broader investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's remarks allowed House Democrats facing tough
re-election fights to set their own course as the House votes to
begin only the third impeachment inquiry into a president's
actions. He spoke as some Democrats openly complained that they
were tired of White House pressure to short-circuit an inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Stopping short of some Democrats' hopes that he would tell them
to vote alongside Republicans and put the burden on them to be
fair, Clinton told reporters, ``It's up to others to decide what
happens to me and ultimately it's going to be up to the American
people to make a clear statement there.'' First Lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton and other aides, however, did keep up an effort to convince
the undecided to vote for their party's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   With the House under the control of a Republican majority, it is
certain to vote against the Democrats' call for a limited inquiry
into Clinton's deceptions of his relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
It will then move to pass the Republicans' broader impeachment
resolution, modeled on the one used to begin the Watergate inquiry
a quarter of a century ago, calling for Clinton to be investigated
``fully and completely.''
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the vote, a letter sent to the Judiciary Committee
by Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel, only bolstered the
Republicans' drive for an open-ended inquiry. Responding to a query
last week from the committee, Starr said that he ``cannot foreclose
the possibility of providing the House of Representatives'' with
additional findings of possible impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Starr would only say that some matters remained under active
investigation, although he made clear in his referral to Congress
that a sexual harassment accusation by Kathleen Willey, a former
White House volunteer, remained unresolved. Clinton has denied
under oath any misconduct with Ms. Willey.
</P>
<P>
   The phrasing of the Republicans' resolution leaves open the door
for the inquiry to move in any direction.
</P>
<P>
   With several dozen agonized Democrats still uncertain how they
will vote, Democratic House leaders went from meeting to meeting on
Wednesday looking for a way to preserve a semblance of party unity
and to prevent many of their members from joining the Republicans
on the crucial vote.
</P>
<P>
   After an impassioned and divided two-hour closed Democratic
caucus, House Democratic leaders revised their own inquiry
proposal, bringing it ever closer to the Republican version.
</P>
<P>
   The new Democratic plan calls for an investigation to end on
Dec. 31. It also leaves open the possibility that any inquiry could
move beyond Clinton's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky should Starr
present more evidence of impeachable offenses on other issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got a Republican proposal,'' said Rep. Dick Gephardt,
the House minority leader. ``You've got a Democratic proposal. Both
of them launch an inquiry. The question is how we're going to do
this. And a lot of our members feel very strongly that this should
be done right. This is a high moment for the House of
Representatives.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic leaders seemed resigned that they would lose anywhere
from two dozen to 60 party members on Thursday's vote. These
Democrats are expected to first vote for the Democratic plan, and
when that fails vote for the Republican plan.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond counting votes and reshaping their alternative, the
leadership was not pressuring House Democrats on how to vote. Rep.
Gary Ackerman, D-N.Y., said his party's leaders were most concerned
about minimizing losses in the looming mid-term election and
``don't want to drown anyone'' by trying to force party unity.

</P>
<P>
   As the House vote neared, a prominent Senate Democrat took to
the floor of his chamber to warn the White House against meddling
on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would suggest by way of friendly advice to the White House:
Don't tamper with this jury,'' said Sen. Robert Byrd of West
Virginia, expressing his displeasure with White House efforts over
the weekend to convince 34 Democratic senators to sign a letter
saying they would not vote to convict the president, should he be
impeached.
</P>
<P>
   To his own colleagues, Byrd said: ``We may have to sit as
jurors. Don't let it be said that we allowed ourselves to be
tampered with.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton himself downplayed the idea that he was lobbying for his
survival. He said that while he was talking to House Democrats, ``a
large number called me. I'm attempting to call them all back and I
will try to do that.'' He said, ``More important than anything else
to me is that they do the people's work.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, demonstrating the turmoil in their ranks, had sharply
different views of what strategy was best for their party.
</P>
<P>
   While the leadership worked on the Democratic plan, Rep. James
Moran of Virginia, a moderate Democrat who has been in touch with
the White House, argued that it was better politically and
tactically for Democrats to vote with the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Such a stand, he argued, would give Democrats more credibility
eventually to vote against Clinton's impeachment. And he argued
that a partisan vote on Thursday would turn the November election
into a referendum on Clinton. ``If November 3 is a referendum on
the president's conduct, we lose,'' he said. ``The endgame for
Democrats is gaining control of the Congress and I don't think we
do that by playing on this field.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Democrats facing tough re-election bids worried that they
were facing what Rep. Calvin Dooley of California described as ``a
lose-lose vote here.'' He said he and colleagues feared that siding
with the Republicans would alienate base Democratic voters while
siding with the Republicans would drive away independent voters.
Dooley said that Clinton's advice to Democrats to vote their
conscience had done nothing to help with this dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Carolyn McCarthy, from a swing New York distirct on Long
Island said she would reluctantly vote for the Republican plan to
launch formal impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, this is probably going to be a no-win situation
for me back home, but the process has to go forward,'' Mrs.
McCarthy said. ``I'm not thrilled about how the Republicans have
made this open-ended, but I believe the process has to be moved
forward.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Eliot Engel, a New York City Democrat, said he strongly
opposed the Republicans' proposal. ``When I go back to my
district,'' he said, ``People are fed up with this. They say,
`Leave the president alone.' ''
</P>
<P>
   As the Democrats agonized, Republicans sat back and waited for
Thursday's vote. House Speaker Newt Gingrich said that Republican
leaders were not counting votes. ``There will be no arm-twisting,'
he said. ``Members need to take this vote as a matter of conscience
and we'll let the chips fall where they may tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, the two parties were still negotiating over
how much time would be alloted for the debate on opening an
impeachment inquiry. As a bargaining ploy, Democrats asked for
eight hours, while Republicans said they were hoping to hold the
debate to two or three hours.

SHOWBIZ SLOWDOWN: LOCATION SHOOTING DECLINES SLIGHTLY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE McNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Hollywood's boom in entertainment production
hasn't gone bust but its days of frantic expansion are over.
</P>
<P>
   One of the clearest indicators is the decline in film crews
shooting on local streets, which had grown by an astounding 78
percent from 1994 through 1997. This year, August production on Los
Angeles County locations outside studios was off 7.8 percent from
August 1997; for the first eight months of the year it's off 0.6
percent, according to figures from the Entertainment Industry
Development Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The county's 1998 movie days have slid 2.3 percent, while TV
days are down 7.4 percent and commercial days are off 8.4 percent.
While some of the off-lot work has been absorbed by new
soundstages, officials admit that the apparent lull is real.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are seeing a slight slowdown,'' conceded Cody Cluff,
president of the EIDC. ``September's figures are going to show a
continued decline in features and commercials with an increase in
TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Walter Roshetski, director of commercial locations for
Burbank-based scouting service Universal Locations, agrees. ``We
usually peak around this time and now it seems a little bit
quieter,'' he noted.
</P>
<P>
   Panavision Inc., the leader in supplying cameras for movie and
TV production, sounded a similar tone in August when it projected
its third-quarter results would be held back by studios shooting
fewer large-budget films and lower production of TV commercials.
</P>
<P>
   And smaller soundstages are reporting lower levels of activity,
according to Patti Archuletta, director of the California Film
Commission. ``They're saying it's becoming harder to get
bookings,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A variety of factors have combined to put the brakes on the
entertainment industry's local growth, including:
</P>
<P>
   _ The possible strike by the Screen Actors Guild, averted during
the spring, led to a rush to complete projects late last year and
early this year. ``Whenever there's a strike threat, producers will
shoot well in advance of it, so things were at a fever pitch at the
beginning of the year,'' Roshetski said.
</P>
<P>
   _ Major studios, notably Disney and Warner Bros., have trimmed
releases from their schedules and focused more on moderately priced
projects. ``We're tending to see films with lower budgets going
into production, which means that instead of 85 or 90 days of
shooting, you'll see 45 or 50,'' Cluff said.
</P>
<P>
   _ The impact of economic problems on commercials. ``We have a
tightening economy, which leads to less ad money,'' Cluff noted.
``Commercials are also affected by Asia and Latin America's
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Continued enticements from the world to shift productions away
from Hollywood even though California's market share of U.S. film
starts edged up from 74 percent in 1994 to 77 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am met with an increasing number of calls from individuals
concerned about the steady number of jobs being exported to places
like Canada and Ireland,'' Archuletta said.
</P>
<P>
   Cluff notes that the increasing value of the U.S. dollar
compared to the Canadian dollar has made north-of-the-border
locations attractive along with incentives such as 20 percent
``labor credits'' for tax reductions. That's led to low-budget
features and movies-of-the-week being lured away from Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   The threat of runaway production from California in the early
1990s led to state and local governments taking steps to retain
production such as simplifying the permitting process. Archuletta
admits that her agency's struggle to create a ``film-friendly''
environment through additional incentives is difficult, given
Hollywood's image as a haven for excessive spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be vigilant about the export of jobs,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, no one is terrified about an impending collapse of
Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody's in a hysterical panic when you consider the enormous
increase in production since 1994,'' Archuletta said. ``It makes
sense that things would level off after all that expansion.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Cluff: ``Production levels are still so high compared to
what we were four years ago. There's a tremendous amount of
shooting going on in Venice, downtown, Hancock Park and at the
beaches.''
</P>
<P>
   Cluff also noted ``The X-Files'' is now shooting in Los Angeles
rather than in Vancouver and that producers of an Arnold
Schwarzenegger film, ``End of Days,'' plan to shoot mostly in Los
Angeles rather than New York, as originally planned. He predicted
TV and feature film activity in Los Angeles will pick up by the end
of the year while commercials will be down slightly.
</P>
<P>
   James Thompson, chief of Real to Reel location services,
admitted he's heard plenty about the slowdown but stressed that his
own business is booming, particularly in supplying hospital
locations such as Valley Presbyterian in Van Nuys. ``We're doing
well, I think, because we went out and got a lot of of new product
that hadn't been used before,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Diana Klein, head of the Malibu Locations scouting service,
offers a similarly sunny view, noting her inventory of properties
surged from 2,500 last year to 4,000 this year, with prime mansions
renting out for as much as $5,000 a day. ``I get five calls a day
from people who want to list their property,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Klein believes the outlook is bright due partly to the explosive
growth of low-cost films made by independent producers. ``Business
is great; we're booking half again as much as last year and it's
all over the map,'' she said. ``It feels like everybody's a
moviemaker now.''

U.S. TO BACK NATO MILITARY ACTION AGAINST SERBS IN KOSOVO
</HEADLINE>
   (See also: KOSOVO-MASSACRE, KOSOVO-U.S., KOSOVO-TRIBUNAL) 
(nk) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS and STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton decided Wednesday that the United
States would vote to give NATO's supreme commander the authority to
carry out military strikes against Yugoslav military and police
forces in response to their crackdown in Kosovo Province.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's decision, disclosed after he met with his senior
national security advisers, underscored the administration's view
that only the real threat of air strikes will persuade Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic to heed international demands to end
his attacks on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Before NATO can act, all of its 16 members must agree on
authorizing strikes, and some of the allies remain reluctant to
clear the way for them, even though Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright has been urging them to do so for several days. A vote by
NATO's representatives, which was originally set for Wednesday or
Thursday, is now not expected to take place until Saturday or
Sunday at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
   Under the NATO charter, a vote to authorize force is the last in
a series of steps needed before the alliance can undertake military
action. While a formality, Wednesday's decision puts the
administration on record as advocating attacks in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The decision is part of the administration's intensifying
campaign to press Milosevic into a diplomatic solution that both
avoids military action and prevents a disaster now facing some of
the estimated 250,000 ethnic Albanians driven from their homes
during the crackdown.
</P>
<P>
   NATO and U.S. officials said Wednesday that Milosevic appeared
to be meeting at least some of the conditions laid out in a U.N.
resolution last month, including a withdrawal of military and
internal security forces.
</P>
<P>
   A Pentagon official said the Yugoslav armed forces had pulled
back more than 50 percent of the armored units that had been
involved in the fighting, but other officials said Milosevic had
not yet met all the demands, including giving aid organizations
free access to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our view that Milosevic is not hearing the message,'' the
spokesman for the National Security Council, David Leavy, said as
he disclosed the president's decision to authorize the strikes.
``He's not in compliance, and future action might be necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   If NATO carries out its threat to strike Yugoslav military and
police forces, the United States will contribute scores of cruise
missiles and more than 250 aircraft to the action, including two of
the Air Force's advanced B-2 ``stealth'' bombers, officials said
Wednesday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The U.S. contribution forms the bulk of more than 400 aircraft
that NATO's 16 allies have pledged to use, if military action is
needed. NATO's supreme commander, Gen. Wesley Clark, has already
completed plans for a range of strikes, starting with a short,
relatively limited cruise missile attack followed by a widening
series of air raids that would hit targets throughout Serbia, the
principal part of what is left of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Even with NATO's authorization to act, there would still be a
window period lasting one to three days before the attacks would
actually begin, giving Milosevic a last chance to comply.
</P>
<P>
   Some NATO allies, particularly Germany, France and Italy, have
indicated that they want to give Russia one more opportunity to
support military action against the Serbs, who are longtime allies
of the Russians. But Russia has already vowed to veto any attempt
by the NATO allies to receive explicit authorization to use force
from the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday the United States reversed course and agreed to
hold another meeting of the so-called contact group, which includes
Russia, before NATO votes on strikes. Albright will fly to London
for the meeting on Thursday after consulting in Brussels with NATO
officials and the American envoy to the Balkans, Richard Holbrooke,
who is trying to broker an agreement between Milosevic and Kosovo's
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   State Department's spokesman James Rubin, who is traveling with
Albright, acknowledged that there is no consensus for military
action against the Serbs. ``We are continuing to push for early
action,'' he said. ``NATO is not there yet.''
</P>
<P>
   After meeting with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban,
President Clinton said it was ``absolutely imperative'' that
Milosevic comply. He also said he hoped the Russians would go
along. ``The most important thing we can do,'' he added, ``is to
try to work with the Russians to try to actually avoid military
strikes by securing compliance.''
</P>
<P>
   He said NATO cannot let ``tens of thousands of people starve or
freeze to death this winter because Mr. Milosevic didn't keep his
word to the Russians and the world community one more time.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the B-2's, the Pentagon has pledged a dozen F-117
stealth strike fighters and half a dozen of the large, powerful
B-52's, as well as F-15 and F-16 fighters based in Europe, the
officials said.

 Senate Ready to Ban New Cyber Levies   By Jon Swartz  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
The U.S. Senate is expected today to approve a three-year ban on
any new taxes on Internet sales and services.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Internet Tax Freedom Act, which has been fiercely debated on
the Senate floor this week, would temporarily stop states and local
municipalities from creating new cyber levies. The bill would also
form a commission to advise Congress on how _ and whether _ to tax
online transactions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a positive public policy that's consistent with our
position of global leadership in electronic commerce,'' said Hank
Barry, a computer law expert and partner at Wilson Sonsini Goodrich
&AMP; Rosati in Palo Alto. ``It strikes the right balance between the
taxation needs of the states and the national interest in promoting
development of the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Co-authored by Representative Christopher Cox, R-Newport Beach,
and Senator Ron Wyden, D-Ore., the bill specifically would:
</P>
<P>
   _ Prohibit new taxes on Internet-access charges, such as the
roughly $20 monthly fee charged by America Online, AT&AMP;T and other
Internet service providers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ban multiple or discriminatory taxes on electronic commerce
transactions. Consumers would pay sales tax on Internet purchases
only if the seller had a ``substantial physical presence'' (such as
offices or employees) in the jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   _ Protect against new Internet-specific taxes for consumers and
vendors, outlawing Web search taxes, e-mail surcharges and other
levies.
</P>
<P>
   _ Create a temporary Advisory Commission on Electronic Commerce
to study e-commerce tax issues and then report to Congress. The
commission could decide on a national tax rate for e-commerce
transactions or advise against virtual taxes altogether.
</P>
<P>
   _ Authorize the Clinton administration to demand that foreign
governments keep the Internet free of taxes and tariffs.
</P>
<P>
   The House has already passed a three-year moratorium on new
Internet charges; it would exempt states with Web taxes already in
effect.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, citing the Internet's key role in the
economic growth the past two years, says he supports the bill.
</P>
<P>
   High-tech companies argue that taxes or surcharges on Internet
access, e-mail and e-commerce, could choke off the growing business
use of the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``Users of the Internet are already taxed through their
telephone service. They shouldn't be levied taxes upon taxes,''
said Ken Salaets, director of government relations of the
Information Technology Industry Council, a Washington, D.C.,
organization that represents 32 major computer-makers, including
Apple Computer, Intel, Hewlett-Packard and IBM.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that happens, it complicates things and discourages people
from using the medium,'' Salaets said.
</P>
<P>
   But some states and cities _ miffed that they're already missing
an estimated $3.3 billion a year in taxes on mail-order sales _
worry that fast-growing online commerce is eroding their finances
by avoiding traditional taxes. They claim it constitutes an unfair
tax haven.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Bob Graham, D-Fla., who opposes the bill, said it favors
Internet sellers over local retail businesses and puts a major hole
in state and local revenues. Last night, Graham engaged in a heated
argument in a last-ditch effort to derail the bill.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-tax Internet bill includes a controversial amendment
authored by Senator Dan Coats, R-Ind., that would bar commercial
Web sites from allowing anyone 17 and under access to pornographic
material deemed ``harmful to minors.'' The Senate passed the
measure 98-1 yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court last year struck down lawmakers' first
attempt to limit online smut, the Communications Decency Act, as a
violation of free-speech rights. That bill was attached to the
Telecommunications Act of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The Coats amendment applies only to commercial Web sites instead
of the entire Internet and uses a ``harmful-to-minors'' standard
instead of a broader indecency standard. It mandates that
adult-oriented sites require a credit card or personal ID number;
if not, the sites face state and local taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The ``harmful-to-minors'' standard would allow access to
material that had redeeming social, political or artistic value.
</P>
<P>
   But the narrow interpretation, derisively dubbed ``CDA II,'' is
still opposed by civil-liberties groups and major companies doing
business on the Internet. They argue the bill would chill the free
exchange of ideas and could be interpreted in conflicting ways
around the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill suffers from the same constitutional problem (as the
original Communication Decency Act),'' said Chris Hansen, senior
staff counsel of the American Civil Liberties Union in New York.
``In the name of protecting children, it tries to ban speech which
is constitutionally protected for adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator Coats is burning down the house to roast the pig,''
Hansen said.

 Intel Developing Several Chip Lines Simultaneously   By Dan Fost  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
While Intel Corp. develops its next-generation chip, code-named
Merced and planned for the most expensive corporate computers, the
chip giant is already working on a processor that will be twice as
powerful.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Details of the other new chip, code-named McKinley, were
revealed in a briefing yesterday at Intel's Santa Clara
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   In a room off the Intel Museum, where visiting schoolchildren
take breaks and play board games, Intel Fellow Fred Pollack
described how the company plans to develop Merced and McKinley _
and at the same time continue to produce its best-selling Pentium
line.
</P>
<P>
   Intel, the world's largest maker of microprocessors, which are
the brains that run computers, announced last year that it would
develop its first new chip architecture in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Working with Hewlett-Packard Co., Intel will produce the Merced
chip, which will mark Intel's entry into 64-bit architecture.
Intel's chips for the past 20 years, from the 286 through the
Pentiums, have processed information in 32-bit chunks.
</P>
<P>
   Merced development stumbled this past summer when Intel
announced a delay of six to nine months.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're doing your first implementation of a new
instruction set architecture, you learn a lot,'' said Pollack, who
heads the group that plans Intel's future microprocessors. ``Those
are very painful lessons, due to the complexity. It's been taking
us longer than we thought.''
</P>
<P>
   Merced is now on track, Pollack said. Software is already being
developed for it. Samples of the chip will be sent to computer
makers next year. It should be ready for commercial use by
mid-2000.
</P>
<P>
   A separate team working on McKinley should have the chip ready
by late 2001, Pollack said.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentium II Xeon, Intel's present entry in the workstation
and server market, will be followed next year by chips code-named
Tanner and Cascades.
</P>
<P>
   Those, in turn, will be followed by chips code-named Willamette
and Foster that will be on the market in late 2000 or early 2001 _
around the same time as Merced.
</P>
<P>
   That shows Intel's continuing division of its core product line
into segments.
</P>
<P>
   Intel will soon sell microprocessors for everything from small
consumer devices and inexpensive personal computers to the most
expensive servers and workstations _ machines that cost upwards of
$25,000.
</P>
<P>
   While the company said the fragmented product line is necessary
to meet a market where one size no longer fits all, analyst Rob
Enderle of the Giga Information Group said it also presents Intel
with a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``They, like Microsoft, have gone from being relatively simple
companies in their product sets to being tremendously complex
companies in brands and product breadth _ Intel much more quickly
than Microsoft,'' Enderle said. ``That's going to put them under a
lot of stress.''
</P>
<P>
   Intel's move into the rarefied air of the most expensive
workstations puts it in direct competition with Sun Microsystems,
International Business Machines and Compaq Computer Corp.
</P>
<P>
   As Intel develops the new chip architecture, the industry is
watching to see when the high-powered machines will trickle down to
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Pollack said the answer was at least three years away, but he
wouldn't predict with any certainty.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was any doubt out there, this road map underscores
the fact that it will be a good long while before you even think
about seeing the IA-64 on your desktop,'' said Mike Feibus, an
analyst with Mercury Research in Scottsdale, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Enderle said he's advising companies to start getting ready
for Merced to hit the desktop in 2002, which will be ``a big year
for hardware change-out.''

 LSI Founder, CEO Rides Out Another Chip Industry Downturn   By Dan Fost  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Wilf Corrigan has been here before.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The chip industry may be suffering from its worst downturn in
memory, but it's not the first time that business has been
battered.
</P>
<P>
   Corrigan, 60, the co-founder, chairman and chief executive of
LSI Logic, remembers the old downturns _ and he remembers the good
times, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the doom and gloom now is the dark before the dawn,''
Corrigan said in an interview in LSI's Milpitas headquarters. ``In
the next three years, you're going to see another cycle like 1993,
'94, '95.''
</P>
<P>
   With a twinkle in his eye and the lilt of his native Liverpool
on his tongue, Corrigan maintains a cheerful outlook even as the
market bumps along the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Corrigan has earned his tough hide. When he was 3, he huddled
with his family in an air raid shelter while German bombs battered
his home during the Blitz. He remains a passionate admirer of
Winston Churchill, whose portrait adorns his office and whose books
line his shelves at home.
</P>
<P>
   In 1960, he moved with his Norwegian-born wife to the United
States, ultimately taking a job with Motorola in Phoenix. By 1968,
he was a vice president.
</P>
<P>
   The following year, when Robert Noyce, Gordon Moore and Andy
Grove left Fairchild Semiconductor to form Intel Corp., Lester
Hogan left the helm of Motorola to run Fairchild. Corrigan was
among the team, known as ``Hogan's Heroes,'' who jumped to
Fairchild with him.
</P>
<P>
   By 1974, Corrigan was president, chairman and chief executive of
the revamped Fairchild Camera and Instrument, but those were trying
times for the once-proud company. That year saw him halve the
workforce, from 30,000 to 15,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Zieber was an analyst at Dataquest back then, and he
recalls Corrigan as a CEO who could swallow a bitter pill.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wrote a newsletter on Fairchild that was just brutal,
probably the worst I've ever written about a company,'' said
Zieber, now president of Pathfinder Research in San Jose. ``I took
it to Wilf, and he read the draft. He corrected one small factual
error, and said, `It's fair.'''
</P>
<P>
   Zieber said Corrigan ``kept Fairchild alive against all odds. He
inherited it with very severe problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wilf is a tough cookie,'' Zieber said. ``If there's a guy I'd
want to run my company in a downturn, Wilf would be the guy. He's
been through it all.''
</P>
<P>
   When the French conglomerate Schlumberger acquired Fairchild in
1979, Corrigan left.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, Corrigan, Mick Bond, Bill O'Meara and Rob Walker
founded LSI Logic _ which stands for large scale integration logic
chips _ with a notion of selling custom-made semiconductors for use
in consumer devices and computers. At the time, the business of
selling such chips, known as application-specific integrated
circuits, or ASICs, was far from a sure thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``People said ASICs weren't anything, but Wilf built LSI into a
giant company,'' said Jack Beedle, the retired founder of In-Stat,
a research firm in Arizona. ``Wilf's one of the legends.''
</P>
<P>
   Next month, the Semiconductor Industry Association will honor
Corrigan and Jerry Sanders, who co-founded and still runs Advanced
Micro Devices, with the Robert Noyce Award, the industry's highest
honor. Corrigan and Sanders are among the founders of the
association.
</P>
<P>
   Among Corrigan's industry achievements, said Brian Halla, a
former Corrigan lieutenant at LSI who is now CEO of National
Semiconductor, is his leadership in negotiations in the 1980s, when
U.S. chip companies accused their Japanese counterparts of dumping
low-price memory chips in the American marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``He represented the whole industry in driving to successful
conclusion of those negotiations,'' Halla said.
</P>
<P>
   Corrigan said too much factory capacity in Asia has contributed
to the oversupply of chips that is a major cause of the current
downturn.
</P>
<P>
   Now in its third year, the slump has hammered company earnings
and led to layoffs of scores of workers. Although LSI has not laid
anyone off this year, it did warn Wall Street that its earnings
would be down this quarter. It reports results next week.
</P>
<P>
   LSI, which employs 6,700 people, reported revenues of $1.3
billion last year. For the first half of this year, the company has
reported revenues of $655 million, up 2.3 percent over the first
half of last year, but earnings have dropped 25.8 percent, from
$84.2 million in the first half of last year to $62.5 million in
the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
   The company's stock reflects the challenges. It closed down 50
cents yesterday at $11.38, its 52-week low. That's substantially
below its 52-week high of $30.25.
</P>
<P>
   No one is hurt by the stock drop more than Corrigan, who is the
company's largest individual shareholder, according to filings with
the Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition to his 1997
income of $1.1 million in salary, bonus and other benefits,
Corrigan holds 7.6 million shares, or 5.4 percent of those
outstanding, with an option to buy 300,000 _ at the now-high price
of $33.25.
</P>
<P>
   In the company's glory days of the early 1990s, the stock topped
$60.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called him during the midst of this downturn in the market
and said, `Not until I was CEO of a semiconductor company did I
realize how much respect I have for you,''' Halla said.
</P>
<P>
   ``His response was typical Wilf: `Where else could you have this
much fun?' He said, `If you ask a woman who's delivering a child if
she wants another when she's in the middle of the birthing process,
she'll say no, but a year later, she again wants the pitter-patter
of little feet.'''
</P>
<P>
   In the last downturn, in 1992, LSI was particularly hard hit,
and Corrigan led a major restructuring. He shifted LSI's focus from
serving hundreds of customers to becoming the ``system-on-a-chip''
company, making exclusive designs for a few trend-setting
customers, according to vice president of marketing Bruce Entin.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, LSI makes the chips for the Sony PlayStation game
console, digital cameras and digital video disc players.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Corrigan's gutsiness helped pull off one of the biggest deals
of the summer, LSI's $760 million acquisition of Symbios. Adaptec
had been all set to take over Symbios, but the Federal Trade
Commission's antitrust concerns scuttled that deal. It fell apart
on a Friday, and by Monday, LSI had cinched the purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Halla spoke admiringly of Corrigan's decisiveness. ``Guys like
Wilf tend to flower in these downturns,'' Halla said. ``On Symbios,
he was clearly very quick to move.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one of reasons I left LSI,'' Halla said. ``I was going
to be the No. 2 guy forever. Wilf kept getting stronger and
stronger.''

Morgan Williams, head of Canford Audio, shown in his company's

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton on
Wednesday undertook the delicate job of persuading wavering
Democrats to support the president on the vote set for Thursday to
authorize a broad impeachment inquiry without actually pleading for
their votes.
</P>
<P>
   This was not a typical congressional vote on which the White
House could sway votes with threats or promises. It was, instead, a
moment of constitutional and political anguish not only for the
president but also for dozens of House Democrats whose own
political futures may rest on their impeachment vote.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House Wednesday morning, Mrs. Clinton told a group
of two dozen freshman representatives that she understood the
difficulty Thursday's vote posed for many Democratic House members
facing close re-election races.
</P>
<P>
   ``She made it very clear that each member should make his own
decision and do whatever they feel is the right thing to do,'' said
Rep. Marion Berry, D-Ark. ``I didn't detect any effort or intention
on her part to change anybody's mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Berry said he had not decided on whether to vote for the
Republican resolution.
</P>
<P>
   In public comments and private discussions with lawmakers, the
president, the first lady and senior White House officials said the
president would neither seek to punish Democrats who voted to
initiate impeachment proceedings nor try to reward those who stood
by him.
</P>
<P>
   But they encouraged House members to support a Democratic plan
to limit the scope and duration of any impeachment investigation.
The president, conceding the virtual certainty he will become only
the third president to face the possibility of impeachment, assured
lawmakers that he intended to cooperate with the House Judiciary
Committee when it begins its inquiry next month.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has returned telephone calls on the impeachment matter
from several Democratic House members over the past several days
and has initiated a handful of calls himself, White House aides
said. Mrs. Clinton met with freshman Democrats, and Vice President
Al Gore has also spoken with wavering lawmakers, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not an all-out lobbying campaign like a budget vote or
a major effort we've done on other legislation,'' said Rahm
Emanuel, a senior presidential adviser. ``This doesn't match up to
that. But we are talking to individual members about their
concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   Another White House aide, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said that the president could not try to strong-arm votes using the
typical tools of persuasion _ budget goodies, offers of
fund-raising help or support for pet legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, he added, has not enjoyed good relations with House
Democrats since 1993, when the president's reversals on budget and
tax bills left many House Democrats feeling betrayed.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials, trying to lower expectations about what
is likely to be a bitter defeat for the president, say they expect
that as many as 80 Democrats may vote for the Republican
impeachment plan, far more defections than Democratic leaders on
Capitol Hill are predicting.
</P>
<P>
   ``They really were hoping that somehow they could hold most
Democrats on this vote, but they're really not going to be able to
do that,'' said an outside adviser to the White House. ``It isn't
going to happen, and that's something they have to adjust to.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In private conversations with several dozen lawmakers, the
president and Mrs. Clinton, as well as Gore and top White House
aides, have argued that the impeachment process has been
excessively partisan and fundamentally unfair. They repeat the
position that nothing in the report from the Whitewater independent
counsel, Kenneth Starr, warrants removing the president from
office.
</P>
<P>
   The president and his lieutenants assured lawmakers Wednesday
that the White House would not hold it against them if they
deserted the president to save their own skins. Joe Lockhart, the
White House press secretary, said that the politically wounded
president ``is not in a position to dictate or compel'' a vote
against the Republican measure authorizing an open-ended
impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sense is that if you hold this thing anywhere below 50
you're doing OK,'' said Leon Panetta, a former White House chief of
staff and Democratic member of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Panetta said he was urging the White House to accept a large
number of defections if they improved the Democrats' re-election
prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better to have that Democrat survive in that office so
that he's around'' to vote against actual articles of impeachment
if and when they are approved by the Judiciary Committee, he said.
</P>
<P>
   One such Democrat in a close re-election contest is freshman
Rep. Ellen Tauscher of California. She said she had spoken to the
president and Erskine Bowles, the White House chief of staff, about
Clinton's willingness to cooperate with an impeachment
investigation if one were authorized.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear there is going to be an inquiry,'' Ms. Tauscher
said Wednesday. ``I wanted to get a sense of what the White House's
intentions were as far as cooperating. He gave a very favorable
impression. I took it to mean he would be cooperative.''
</P>
<P>
   One former Democratic congressman, lobbying on the president's
behalf, described his pitch this way:
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not trying to tell you what your district wants _ you know
that better than anyone. But the Republicans are incapable of
running this fairly, and the lower we can keep the Democratic vote,
the stronger position we will be in when the public gets sick of
their witch hunt.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Carolyn McCarthy, D-N.Y., said that despite pleas from the
White House and its surrogates, she would probably vote with the
Republicans to authorize the impeachment investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not thrilled about how the Republicans have made this
open-ended,'' Ms. McCarthy said, ``but I believe the process has to
be moved forward.''

UT BECOMING DEFENSIVE AS SEASON GOES ON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let's not sugarcoat the obvious. The Longhorns' defense, which
allows 444 yards and 37.4 points per game, leaks like a rusty
faucet with a worn-out washer.
</P>
<P>
   Even coach Mack Brown admits his best defensive player, at this
juncture, is tailback Ricky Williams. And his job is to keep Texas'
tacklers on the sidelines by racking up rushing yards, points and _
most important _ time of possession.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, however, the Heisman Trophy hopeful might lose his title
as the Longhorns' leading defender. That's because the Texas
defense scheduled to take the field against Oklahoma at 11:30 a.m.
Saturday at the Cotton Bowl is doing something the 1997 unit never
did: getting better.
</P>
<P>
   Each week, the Longhorns show an increased understanding of
first-year defensive coordinator Carl Reese's aggressive scheme.
Assignment busts are down. Big plays are up.
</P>
<P>
   Want proof? The Longhorns' past two opponents, Rice and Iowa
State, were a combined 10-of-31 on third-down conversions. Texas
forced seven turnovers in those games, improving to plus-2 in
turnover ratio, the most significant statistic kept by the NCAA.
The 1997 Longhorns, by contrast, surrendered 20 more turnovers than
they forced.
</P>
<P>
   Although the secondary remains suspect against the pass, the run
defense will not appear on any highlight tapes for Iowa State
tailback Darren Davis, the nation's No. 9 rusher. He managed 53
yards, less than half his season average (130.4), on 20 carries.
Against Rice, the option-oriented Owls averaged a meager 4.0 yards
per carry after gashing the Longhorns at a 6.4 clip in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In the Big 12, you can win if you can stop the run.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say Oklahoma tailback De'Mond Parker won't find
running room in the Cotton Bowl. He will. But don't expect him to
approach last year's 291-yard rushing total. And don't expect these
Longhorns to revert to the clueless, arm-tackling bunch we saw last
season. Or in the Sept. 5 opener against New Mexico State, for that
matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're tackling better,'' Brown said. ``We're playing harder
and with a lot more confidence. I'm pleased with our defense
against the run. We've played much better defensive games the past
two weeks against much better teams than New Mexico State.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure, these Longhorns are not a finished product. But the weekly
position changes have stopped. Freshmen playmakers Jermain
Anderson, Everick Rawls and Ervis Hill have adjusted to the speed
of the college game.
</P>
<P>
   Free safety Quentin Jammer, a converted cornerback who almost
lost his job after the first three games, recorded a team-high nine
tackles and forced a fumble against Rice. He followed with another
solid effort against Iowa State.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quentin has come so far in the last two weeks, it's
incredible,'' said Brown, who considered benching Jammer before the
Rice game. ``He'd never played the position before. When we started
the season, he was lost. Now, he's tackling well and anticipating
well.''
</P>
<P>
   The same can be said of the entire defense, which is young but
improving. A year ago, it was neither.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the season, don't be surprised if Brown has put
together a defense capable of winning games without a 300-yard
rushing day from its top ``defensive'' player.  &LR; tagtop:Jimmy Burch,

 &LR; subheds:QUICK HITS Ringing tribute
Texas A&AMP;M officials are rolling out the red carpet to honor the
national champions. But not the ones from Nebraska, the 18th-ranked
Aggies' opponent at 2:30 p.m. Saturday at Kyle Field.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, members of A&AMP;M's 1939 national championship team will
receive rings commemorating their accomplishment. The rings will be
awarded at a pregame luncheon, with players acknowledged during a
halftime ceremony, in which the A&AMP;M band will spell out ``1939
Champs.''
</P>
<P>
   A total of 64 rings will be presented to surviving players or
their family members. Of the 26 living players, 22 are scheduled to
attend the ceremony. Cost for the rings was covered by three
donors, with A&AMP;M president Dr. Ray Bowen chipping in $5,000 of the
$17,000 tab.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Shelton, a retired banker from Fort Worth who played
center on the 1939 team, said the response from school officials
has been ``just overwhelming'' since the day he suggested the idea
to A&AMP;M athletic director Wally Groff. In 1939, championship rings
were not issued. Players received a football medallion and a
leather travel bag, neither of which mentioned the Aggies' No. 1
ranking or 11-0 record.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the culmination of a great life for a lot of great
people,'' said Shelton, 80. ``It will be very emotional. I've
already seen mine and a big lump came in my throat the first time I
tried it on.''
Rankled by rankings
</P>
<P>
   Texas Tech coach Spike Dykes downplays the fact his 5-0 team,
for a second consecutive week, fell one spot short of a berth in
the Top 25. But the issue is perplexing to players, who have a
better record than 20 of the 25 teams ranked ahead of the Red
Raiders in this week's polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, we deserve to be in there,'' defensive end
Taurus Rucker said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not something that really bothers me, but I think we
deserve to be up in there,'' said tailback Ricky Williams. ``If we
keep winning, we'll get there.''
Many happy returns
</P>
<P>
   Among the four high-profile matchups on this week's schedule,
the most compelling subplot might unfold in Boulder, Colo. That is
where Kansas State punt returner David Allen (30.7 yards per
attempt, three TDs) will be matched against Colorado kickoff
returner Ben Kelly (30.9 per return). Both lead the Big 12 in their
respective departments.
</P>
<P>
   As a team, the Wildcats lead the nation in both punt returns
(26.4 average) and kickoff returns (33.7). Colorado ranks seventh
(17.6) and fourth (31.4), respectively. The teams have combined to
score six touchdowns on special teams, all on punt returns.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are maybe the best in the country at using special teams
as a weapon,'' Colorado coach Rick Neuheisel said of the Wildcats.
``And we're not bad, either. That should make the kicking game
really, really pivotal this week.''
 &LR; subheds:QUICK HITS
</P>
<P>
   Why is A&AMP;M picking this weekend to give championship rings to
its 1939 team members? While organizing the event, A&AMP;M athletic
director Wally Groff was told by Nebraska counterpart Bill Byrne
there would be no seats for the Aggies band when the teams meet in
1999 in Lincoln, Neb. That being the case, Groff told Byrne to
leave the Nebraska band at home Saturday, creating time for the
halftime ceremony. ``Besides, it's certainly appropriate that we'd
honor our national champions when the \Rreigning\S national
champions are coming to town,'' said Howard Shelton, who helped
organize the event. ... As if No. 5 Kansas State didn't have enough
things going its way, this is the week when tailback Frank Murphy
becomes eligible after serving a four-game suspension for accepting
improper benefits from a booster. Murphy was the 1997 junior
college player of the year, rushing for 1,370 yards and 26
touchdowns. Kansas State coach Bill Snyder said Murphy will play
Saturday against No. 14 Colorado, ``but I'm not sure how much.''
... Although the national trend is toward natural-grass fields, the
league's only unbeaten teams _ Nebraska, Kansas State, Texas Tech,
Colorado _ all play their home games on artificial turf. ...
Opponents have started only four drives in A&AMP;M territory this
season, all of them came in a 23-14 loss to No. 8 Florida State.
The Aggies have started 18 drives in enemy territory. ... Tech has
trailed its opponent for 12 minutes, 29 seconds of a possible 300
minutes this season. ... Because of mounting injuries on the
defensive line, Baylor coach Dave Roberts said freshmen Travis
Hicks and Kevin Stevenson might play Saturday against Kansas.
Heading into the season, Roberts said he hoped to redshirt both
players. ... Although Nebraska quarterbacks Bobby Newcombe (knee)
and Eric Crouch (hip) have taken limited snaps in practice this
week, coach Frank Solich said both have ``a decent chance'' of
playing against A&AMP;M. Responded A&AMP;M coach R.C. Slocum: ``When the
ball is snapped on game day, I'll bet neither one of those guys is
far from the action.'' ... Texas has had a 100-yard receiver in
five consecutive games, tying a school record.

AMP SHARES RISE ON OPTIMISM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa.)  (js) 
 By SHARON R. KING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shares of AMP Inc. rose as much as 6.3 percent Wednesday as
investors expressed optimism that legislation passed by the
Pennsylvania House of Representatives late Tuesday could help
Allied Signal in its $9.7 billion hostile takeover bid for the
company.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, a series of amendments attached to another banking
measure, specifies that during the 12 months after an unsolicited
takeover bid for a company, shareholders can take action on the
proposal only at a scheduled meeting.
</P>
<P>
   But a new amendment to the proposal would allow Allied Signal to
call a special meeting of AMP shareholders to consider its offer to
buy the electrical-connector maker for $44.50 a share.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation also rescinds severance packages, known as
golden parachutes, recently put in place for a number of senior
executives of AMP, based in Harrisburg, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Investors reacted favorably to the news. AMP shares, after
rising as high as $40, closed at $37.875, up 25 cents.
</P>
<P>
   ``The board should now instruct management to negotiate, with
Allied Signal or any other third party, a fair price for all
shareholders,'' said Peter Schoenfeld, chairman of P. Schoenfeld
Asset Management, an investment advisory firm. Schoenfeld said his
firm tendered ``several hundred thousand'' AMP shares to Allied.
</P>
<P>
   An AMP spokesman said the company was pleased with the support
it had from the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the House vote, uncertainties linger. The state Senate,
now in recess, is not expected to vote on the bill before Tuesday.
The Senate then could pass the legislation or change it, which
could require another House vote. Although Gov. Tom Ridge has said
he supports the AMP measure, he recently expressed concern about
the bill to which the AMP amendments are attached: legislation
intended to protect Mellon Bank Corp., based in Pittsburgh, from a
hostile offer from the Bank of New York.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a federal judge in Philadelphia is expected to rule
as early as Thursday on whether Allied Signal can proceed with
plans to gain control of AMP's board in order to rescind AMP's
anti-takeover provision and force the company to consider its
$44.50-a-share offer.
</P>
<P>
   If successful, the tender could make Allied the company's
largest shareholder. By Wednesday, investors had tendered about
156.7 million, or 72 percent of the outstanding shares, to Allied,
the company said.

NFL CAPSULES FOR WEEK 6
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ANDY FRIEDLANDER 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAME OF THE WEEK DENVER (5-0) AT SEATTLE (3-2) Time: 3:15 p.m.,
Sunday Site: Kingdome, Seattle (66,400) Series: Broncos lead 26-15
Last season: Broncos 35, at Seahawks 14; At Broncos 30, Seahawks 27
Line: No line
</P>
<P>
   Broncos update: This is what it has come to. The Broncos are so
overpowering, so offensively dominant that they have turned QB
Bubby Brister _ yes, the same Bubby Brister who was run out of
Pittsburgh, Philadelphia and New York _ into the AFC's No. 1
passer. The secret is in front of him, with a line that has allowed
a mere five sacks this season, and behind him, where RB Terrell
Davis is the NFL's leading rusher (657 yards, 5.8 per carry) and
second-leading scorer (48 points on eight TDs). And don't forget
the receivers, three of whom are on pace for 1,000-yard seasons.
For Brister, a guy who was beaten up by both defenses and fans at
every other NFL stop he's made, this is a vacation. And if the
offense is this healthy running on autopilot, imagine it with John
Elway back in the saddle after resting his sore hamstrings for
two-plus weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Seahawks update: In the past, this is where the skid has always
begun. Every time the Seahawks have shown signs of moving into the
NFL's high-rent district, they get slapped back down by a real
contender or two and it destroys their entire season. Well, here we
go again, because the same team that looked unbeatable in three
early wins against the league's wretched refuse, have fallen to
earth with two consecutive losses to Pittsburgh and Kansas City.
Seattle desperately needs a win to remain within sight of the AFC
West title, and may have to get it without QB Warren Moon, who
cracked some ribs in the last game and is questionable for Sunday.
If he can't go, the burden of the offense falls on journeyman QB
John Friesz and talented but erratic RB Ricky Watters.
</P>
<P>
   Key matchup: In WR Joey Galloway, the Seahawks have one of the
premier weapons in the league, a long-ball threat who has used his
phenomenal speed to average 17.0 yards per catch and score three
TDs. On the other side is a Denver secondary that has accounted for
six interceptions and two touchdowns in its last three games. Ray
Crockett and Darrien Gordon are as good a pair of CBs as there is,
and Gordon is one of the few players who can run with Galloway
stride-for-stride.
</P>
<P>
   Pick: Broncos 34, Seahawks 21 BUFFALO (1-3) AT INDIANAPOLIS
(1-4) Time: Noon, Sunday Site: RCA Dome, Indianapolis (60,599)
Series: Bills lead 31-23-1 Line: Buffalo by 2 1/2
</P>
<P>
   Bills update: Bruce Smith is apparently healthy again after
off-season knee surgery, which means quarterbacks should tremble.
The all-everything defensive end is coming off his best performance
of the year, which, not coincidentally, turned out to be the Bills'
first victory of the year, a head-scratching upset of mighty San
Francisco. But Smith's recovery isn't the only good news. The
running game by committee is racking up 132.5 yards per game, and
WR Eric Moulds has picked up for aging and injured veteran Andre
Reed. Throw in a solid plus-five turnover margin, and the Bills may
be on the way up, at least a little.
</P>
<P>
   Colts update: OK, so the run defense in still nonexistent, the
offensive line is still filled with inexperience, and QB Peyton
Manning still leads the league in interceptions. But no longer can
cynics sneer at ``the winless Colts.'' Now the task is to build on
it. Most of their hopes for the short term rest on RB Marshall
Faulk, who ranks second in the league in combined rushing-receiving
yardage. He could get help from recently signed FB Craig
``Ironhead'' Heyward, who can use his 262 pounds as a blocker to
try to improve Faulk's miserable 3.1 yards per carry average.
</P>
<P>
   Pick: Bills 23, Colts 9
CAROLINA (0-4) AT DALLAS (3-2) Time: Noon, Sunday Site: Texas
Stadium, Irving (65,675) Series: Panthers lead 1-0 Line: Dallas by
7
</P>
<P>
   Panthers update: Talk about a downward spiral. In 1996, this
team pounded the Cowboys in the playoffs to advance to the NFC
Championship Game. Now it's 0-4 and sinking fast. Coach Dom Capers
has been hailed as a defensive genius, but it's tough to be that
smart when some of your best players, including LB Lamar Lathon,
are out with injuries. About all that's left is LB Kevin Greene, a
venerable pass-rush specialist whose nine sacks lead the league.
But stop the run? Not these Cats, who give up 134.8 rushing yards a
game. On the other hand, their opponents have been terrific against
the run _ Carolina ranks 28th in rushing offense.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys update: The Cowboys' walk through the park continues
with yet another date against a winless team, the second course of
Dallas' feast of creampuffs and marshmallows, a collection of six
opponents with a combined record of 5-24. Why, that kind of
schedule can even make another week or two of backup QB Jason
Garrett look good, especially with two-headed RB Emmitt Smith and
Chris Warren running with authority. That combination has lifted
the Cowboys to No. 2 on the NFC rushing list, which is why, as long
as Garrett doesn't turn the ball over, the Cowboys should roll over
the defenseless Panthers.
</P>
<P>
   Pick: Cowboys 31, Panthers 17
KANSAS CITY (4-1) AT NEW ENGLAND (3-1) Time: Noon, Sunday Site:
Foxboro Stadium, Foxboro, Mass. (60,292) Series: Chiefs lead 14-7-3
Line: No line
</P>
<P>
   Chiefs update: As usual, QB Rich Gannon got the job done. And,
as usual, it's time for him to hand off that starting job, back to
Elvis Grbac after three wins in four outings that raised Gannon's
record as a starter to 8-2 over the last two years. But now Grbac
is back and he takes over the reins of an offense that has
performed nicely in a supporting role to the NFL's No. 1 ranked
defense. The Chiefs are opportunistic, leading the league with 16
takeaways, including an amazing 11 fumble recoveries. That projects
to 35 for the year, which would shatter the NFL record of 31, held
by the 1963 Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   Patriots update: If the Chiefs are masters of taking the ball
away, the Patriots are terrific at protecting it. New England went
three games without a turnover before QB Drew Bledsoe threw three
interceptions Sunday in New Orleans, breaking a string of 115
consecutive attempts without one. Even with the picks, Bledsoe is
one of the league's premier passers, a guy who can carry a team by
himself. The scary part is the Pats' defense, which last week made
New Orleans nobody Danny Wuerffel look like Brett Favre ... wait,
bad analogy ... make that Randall Cunningham.
</P>
<P>
   Pick: Chiefs 21, Patriots 20
PITTSBURGH (3-1) AT CINCINNATI (1-3) Time: Noon, Sunday Site:
Cinergy Field, Cincinnati (60,389) Series: Steelers lead 32-23
Line: Pittsburgh by 2 1/2
</P>
<P>
   Steelers update: It's been awfully ugly in Western Pennsylvania,
but somehow the Steelers are 3-1 and right behind Jacksonville for
the AFC Central lead. That despite a horribly anemic offense that
averages just 12.5 points per game, more than only pitiful
Philadelphia and Indianapolis, and a QB, Kordell Stewart, who has
been intercepted six times and has thrown just two TDs. The answers
have been a decent defense led by DB Carnell Lake and LB Levon
Kirkland and powerful RB Jerome Bettis, not to mention a bit of
luck.
</P>
<P>
   Bengals update: If you're looking for stout defense, don't
bother looking at Cinergy Field, because the Bengals are about as
defenseless as it gets, giving up 375 yards a game. Still,
Cincinnati is dangerous because WR Carl Pickens, the AFC receiving
leader, and RB Corey Dillon, one of the league's strongest power
runners, are legitimate offensive threats. And while no one would
mistake QB Neil O'Donnell with one of the elite passers, he owns
the league's best completion percentage at .667.
</P>
<P>
   Pick: Steelers 13, Bengals 7
SAN FRANCISCO (3-1) AT NEW ORLEANS (3-1) Time: Noon, Sunday Site:
Louisiana Superdome, New Orleans (69,028) Series: 49ers lead
40-15-2 Line: San Francisco by 10
</P>
<P>
   49ers update: What the heck happened? It was like the most
productive offensive machine in football didn't bother coming to
the stadium, and the Oakland Raiders showed up instead, committing
an NFL record-tying 22 penalties in a ghastly loss to Buffalo. That
won't happen again. QB Steve Young and supremely talented WRs Jerry
Rice and J.J. Stokes against a defense ranked 29th against the
pass? Puh-leeze. Now, if only the Niners could figure out what's
wrong on defense _ no team has allowed more yards per game than San
Francisco's 377. Perhaps a date against the Saints will help that,
but we said the same thing about Buffalo, didn't we?
</P>
<P>
   Saints update: How exactly are the Saints doing it? In losing
last week for the first time this season, New Orleans nonetheless
gained a bit of legitimacy by taking New England down to the final
three seconds before falling. As usual, neither the offense nor the
defense posted impressive numbers, but there must be something to
this Danny Wuerffel guy, who seems to come up big in the clutch.
And maybe, just maybe, there's something to this Mike Ditka, who
has at least the players believing, if no one else.
</P>
<P>
   Pick: 49ers 49, Saints 17
TENNESSEE (1-3) AT BALTIMORE (2-2) Time: Noon, Sunday Site: Ravens
Stadium at Camden Yards, Baltimore (68,400) Series: Tied 2-2 Line:
Baltimore by 3
</P>
<P>
   Oilers update: Paging Mr. George. Mr. Eddie George. The Oilers
running back, who last year ran for 1,399 yards to finish fifth in
the league, is among the missing, with just 222 yards and an
average of 2.9 per rush this season. Without question, he has
dragged the Oilers' attack down with him, giving them the NFL's
worst ground game. That's far too much responsibility to push on a
defense that defines mediocrity, not to mention QB Steve McNair and
the passing game, which is a long way from scaring anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Ravens update: The QB controversy is over, and it's time for
Eric Zeier to show what he's got. Start with a .620 completion
percentage and a 102.4 rating, second in the AFC. Another thing he
certainly has is an explosive target in fleet Jermaine Lewis, whose
league-best average of 32.5 yards per catch is almost 10 yards
better than anyone else. Oh, yes, he also leads the league in punt
returns, with two runbacks for TDs. And don't forget RB Priest
Holmes, whose 173-yard debut as a starter two weeks ago was a
revelation.
</P>
<P>
   Pick: Ravens 27, Oilers 16
WASHINGTON (0-5) AT PHILADELPHIA (0-5) Time: Noon, Sunday Site:
Veterans Stadium, Philadelphia (65,352) Series: Redskins lead
68-53-5 Line: Washington by 3
</P>
<P>
   Redskins update: They're calling this the Paper Bag Bowl, and
surely brown sacks with eyeholes cut out will be the attire of the
day for fans on both sides. If this game, doesn't sum up the horrid
NFC East, it can't be done. The Redskins are the NFC's most
generous team, having presented opponents with 13 turnovers, while
managing just two on their side. While hanging onto the ball is a
problem, moving it usually isn't, with budding star WR Michael
Westbrook anchoring the passing game and reliable RB Terry Allen
near the top of the rushing statistics. But the defense has
disappeared, especially in the red zone, where opponents score a
league-high 76.5 percent on the time.
</P>
<P>
   Eagles update: All in all, the Eagles would probably rather be
anywhere but Philadelphia, where the notoriously nasty fans won't
hesitate to savage the home team if they play like they've played
all year. Even five TDs in the last two weeks hasn't pushed the
Eagles out of last place in scoring, with just 53 points in five
games. The defense is next-to-last in the conference against the
run, giving up 5.0 yards per attempt, bad news against a tough
runner like Allen.
</P>
<P>
   Pick: Redskins 28, Eagles 8
 &LR; subheds:CHICAGO (1-4) AT ARIZONA (2-3) Time: 3:15 p.m., Sunday
Site: Sun Devil Stadium, Tempe, Ariz. (73,273) Series: Bears lead
52-25-6 Line: Arizona by 3 1/2
</P>
<P>
   Bears update: After breaking a nine-game losing streak with a
win that left Chicago four games out of first place just five weeks
into the season, some Bears were actually talking playoffs in the
locker room. They might have a chance if someone adjusted the rules
to eliminate the third quarter, in which the Bears have been bombed
61-0. QB Erik Kramer is finally living up to his big contract,
putting up a nice 92.3 rating, but the defense needs to hold up its
end of the bargain.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals update: OK, so the Cards are 2-3 and are scoring fewer
than 17 points per game. In the NFC East, that's what we call a
good year. Arizona is just a game behind Dallas for the division
lead, and that's with the guy who's supposed to be its big star, QB
Jake Plummer, struggling with a passer rating of 65.4 and seven
interceptions. But the Cards are much better defensively, paced by
four sacks from precocious rookie DE Andre Wadsworth.
</P>
<P>
   Pick: Cardinals 17, Bears 13
NEW YORK JETS (2-2) AT ST. LOUIS (1-3) Time: 3:15 p.m., Sunday
Site: Trans World Dome, St. Louis (66,000) Series: Rams lead 6-2
Line: Jets by 3 1/2
</P>
<P>
   Jets update: Vinny or Foley? It's hard to argue with Vinny
Testaverde's performance as the Jets' QB. In two-plus games, he has
posted five TDs, just one interception (on a half-ending Hail Mary)
and a 104.9 passer rating. But Glenn Foley was the starter until he
got hurt, and it says on page 47 of the Football Coach's Handbook
that you don't lose a starting job because of injury. Regardless of
who plays, the offense may be hurting because RB Curtis Martin is
questionable with a bruised thigh.
</P>
<P>
   Rams update: Robert Holcombe? Who's he? The latest savior of the
Rams' running game, which somehow has accounted for 120.8 yards per
game without a single recognizable back. But he put up 84 yards and
two scores in his first start two weeks ago, and the Rams will need
more of that to take some of the pressure off mistake-prone QB Tony
Banks, who has accounted for all of St. Louis' 10 turnovers thios
year.
</P>
<P>
   Pick: Jets 31, Rams 21
SAN DIEGO (2-3) AT OAKLAND (3-2) Time: 3:15 p.m., Sunday Site:
Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum, Oakland, Calif. (63,263) Series:
Raiders lead 45-29-2 Line: No line
</P>
<P>
   Chargers update: Obviously, the Chargers are getting no help at
all from the QB position, what with Ryan Leaf saddled with the
league's lowest rating (36.5) and nine interceptions against just
one TD. So coach Kevin Gilbride has turned to RB Natrone Means to
drag the team along with him, as evidenced by Means' 31 carries
last week. Look for more of that as the Chargers try to weather
Leaf's growing pains.
</P>
<P>
   Raiders update: Practically everyone who's anyone on the Raiders
is hurt, beginning with QB Jeff George, listed as doubtful with a
strained groin, and RB Napoleon Kaufman, the AFC's third-leading
rusher, who's questionable with a sprained left ankle. That takes
away about two-thirds of the Raiders' offense and puts a huge
burden on a defense that has risen quickly behind DT Darrell
Russell and rising star CB Charles Woodson.
</P>
<P>
   Pick: Chargers 17, Raiders 12
ATLANTA (3-1) AT NEW YORK GIANTS (2-3) Time: 7:20 p.m., Sunday
Site: Giants Stadium, East Rutherford, N.J. (77,716) Series: Tied
6-6 Line: Giants by 2 1/2
</P>
<P>
   Falcons update: The P-word _ that's playoffs _ is popping up in
Atlanta, and why not? The Falcons have the ingredients, with a
solid QB, a power running game and the NFC's No. 2-ranked run
defense. And they're a second-half team, outscoring opponents 42-10
after halftime. But history works against the Falcons, who are 3-1
for only the fifth time in their 33 seasons and have been 4-1 just
twice before. So does the pass defense, which has allowed opponents
to complete 62.4 percent of their passes.
</P>
<P>
   Giants update: If President Clinton weren't otherwise occupied,
he might check to see if the Giants' offense qualifies for federal
disaster relief funds. The Giants can't throw (QB Danny Kanell has
just 866 yards and eight interceptions), they can't run (a
league-worst 2.9 yards per rush average) and they sure can't hide
in the nation's No. 1 media market. A defense that has recorded 19
sacks, six by DE Mike Strahan, and seven interceptions has kept the
Giants afloat, but they're taking on water awfully quick.
</P>
<P>
   Pick: Falcons 27, Giants 3
MIAMI (3-1) AT JACKSONVILLE (4-0) Time: 7:20 p.m., Monday Site:
Alltell Stadium, Jacksonville, Fla. (73,000) Series: First meeting
Line: Jacksonville by 6 1/2
</P>
<P>
   Dolphins update: It hadn't been done all year, but last week,
the Jets proved it's possible to run on the Miami defense. Now,
will the Dolphins allow that to happen again? Coach Jimmy Johnson
will get out his motivational bag of tricks for this one, a big
game against a Super Bowl contender from just up the coast. But to
get out of Jacksonville with a win, the Dolphins will have to run
more than the 15 times they tried last week and must play solid
inside defense to back it up.
</P>
<P>
   Jaguars update: RT Leon Searcy. RG Brian DeMarco. C Quentin
Neujahr. LG Ben Coleman. LT Tony Boselli. Remember their names,
because they are the reason the Jags are off to the best start in
their brief history. The Jags' dominating line is why QB Mark
Brunell rarely gets sacked (eight times this year), giving him time
to complete more than 65 percent of his passes. And it's why RB
Fred Taylor stepped right in with a pair of 100-yard performances
when James Stewart went down. And it's why Jacksonville is easily
the best team in the AFC Central.
</P>
<P>
   Pick: Miami 17, Jacksonville 14

AIKMAN DONS PADS FOR THROWING DRILLS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS and CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman threw for
several minutes in his shoulder pads yesterday for the first time
since he suffered a fractured collarbone against the Denver Broncos
last month.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys coach Chan Gailey said Aikman will continue to work out
in shoulder pads for the remainder of his rehabilitation. After
having his left collarbone X-rayed Monday, Aikman said he does not
expect to play again until Nov. 2 at Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just trying to get back in a groove,'' Gailey said.
``He felt pretty good about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if his timetable for Aikman returning to the starting
lineup had changed, Gailey said, ``We're still on that X-ray
timetable.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys play host to Carolina on Sunday, travel to play the
Chicago Bears on Oct. 18 and have a bye on Oct. 25.
Blitzing Panthers
</P>
<P>
   Rookie offensive lineman Flozell Adams has impressed Cowboys
coaches with his physical ability and his mental awareness. While
Carolina possesses talented defenders, Adams' biggest challenge in
his first career start Sunday figures to be coping with the
Panthers' defensive strategy.
</P>
<P>
   The Panthers are one of the few teams who employ a 3-4 defense,
with three down linemen and four linebackers. In the Panthers'
scheme, any of the front seven can come on a blitz at any time.
</P>
<P>
   To prepare for the blitzing Panthers, Adams stayed late after
practice yesterday working with offensive line coach Hudson Houck.
Center Clay Shiver said it is imperative that he work with Adams on
blocking assignments to prevent mental mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've worked with Everett McIver and Nate Newton for a while,
and sometimes you take for granted what the calls are on the line.
You just know they know who to block on certain situations,''
Shiver said. ``I'll need to work more on my communication so Flo
will know who he's got. I have to make sure that I don't take what
\RAdams\S knows for granted.''
Irvin's message
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys receiver Michael Irvin wore a T-shirt this week with
this inscription on the back, ``We're claiming it back.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Irvin downplayed the message, saying he got the T-shirt
in training camp, the point was clear. After seeing their string of
five consecutive NFC East titles end last year when the New York
Giants won the division, the Cowboys came into 1998 looking to
regain their spot atop the East.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys (3-2) appear to be well on their way, with an
undefeated division record in three games. However, the Cowboys and
Irvin are nowhere close to being satisfied _ especially considering
that each victory so far has been followed by a loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't done anything yet,'' Irvin said. ``All we've done
is win, lose, win, lose, win. We've got to put it together.''

Boris Yeltsin's rule. Along with a road block in Vladivostok, the

Morgan Williams, head of Canford Audio, shown in his company's

PEROT SPEEDS UP CITY FULL OF SLOW THINKERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ In doing his civic homework, Ross Perot Jr. might have
inadvertently stumbled upon the best name ever for what he promises
will be the best sports arena ever.
</P>
<P>
   Call it The Belle Starr.
</P>
<P>
   ``Belle was supposed to have had her bar pretty close to where
we're standing,'' said Perot, with the downtown skyscrapers only
two blocks away. ``At one time, back in the 1800s, this was known
as the wild side of town. Prostitution, open gambling, the works.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, yes, the city's fast lane for a past generation. But while
things do change, sometimes they really don't. A fast lane of
another kind _ not just for Dallas, but all of North Texas _ is
being planned in the legendary Ms. Starr's old neighborhood, north
of downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Before here, however, the same was happening in Arlington. And
in Grand Prairie. And in far north Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas, with a longstanding sordid resume by civic leaders on
understanding the business benefits of sports, now checks in last.
It won't be least, however, if Perot pulls off this arena grand
scheme.
</P>
<P>
   In the past five years, The Ballpark in Arlington has opened.
Lone Star Park at Grand Prairie has opened. The Texas Motor
Speedway has opened. In baseball, thoroughbred racing and
automobile racing, all are nationally recognized as showpiece,
best-in-the-country facilities.
</P>
<P>
   To the credit of Tex Schramm and city of Irving leaders from
three generations ago, Texas Stadium remains one of football's top
venues, 26 years later.
</P>
<P>
   The one common factor, of course, is Dallas had first crack at
the Cowboys, the Rangers, the horses, the cars. And Dallas blew it,
proving Amon Carter Sr. correct. When it comes to sports, this
place has always been a sack-lunch kind of town.
</P>
<P>
   Smart and prosperous businessmen, however, are always on scent.
They can smell money 10 miles away. The fiscal health of sports in
North Texas needs no other explanation than the entry of a Perot
and a Tom Hicks into the team ownership ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, Perot had to ask if basketball was played five
to a side _ he was asking ``after'' he had purchased the Mavericks.
At the same time, Hicks admittedly had no love or clue about ice
hockey when he wrote the check for the Stars. Both those
transactions were originally done in the name of business.
</P>
<P>
   Perot, for his part, mostly saw real estate heaven attached to
the Mavericks, as in a new downtown arena for both the basketball
and the hockey teams. A street fight of a city election in January
cleared the way for an arena _ by a mere 1,100 votes.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Perot has to deliver, and the initial step comes today at a
news conference to outline the plans for an immense urban project
including arena, retail shops, business offices, entertainment
complex and apartments. All of it right there next to the
skyscrapers.
</P>
<P>
   What Perot has promised is the best sports and concert arena in
the country. What he also plans is a massive development around the
arena, that being dependent upon market conditions. The doubters in
Dallas hound him on that development part, but those doubters
didn't want the arena either.
</P>
<P>
   Calmly, Perot stays in the fast lane.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I want, is 10 years from now, grandfathers bringing
grandkids down here and telling them how their vote helped build
this for Dallas,'' he said. ``Even if there were a no vote in the
election, I don't want them to be able to admit it.''
</P>
<P>
   A century ago, there were probably grandfathers who also
wouldn't admit they visited Belle Starr's joint in the same area of
town. And for what it's worth, Hicks started off being strictly a
build-the-arena advocate. He cared little for the project beyond
the arena. Hicks and Perot were also at odds on most other issues,
even though their teams will share the arena.
</P>
<P>
   But two weeks ago, Hicks called Perot's development plan
surrounding the arena ``one of the best I've ever seen.'' He also
praised Perot for the design work on the arena. It would not be
far-fetched to think of Hicks as an eventual partner in the
Mavericks, plus an eventual partner in the entire real estate
project. Hicks, of course, has a business reputation of knowing
where and when to place his money.
</P>
<P>
   ``The centerpiece is the arena,'' Perot said. ``Everything will
revolve around that. From a sports standpoint, this means I have to
personally make this Mavericks thing work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom has the Stars on the verge of a Stanley Cup, and this will
be an arena and a development designed for only the best _ only for
championship-caliber teams, not secondary teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, OK, Perot is also a dreamer. The Mavericks, at the moment,
won't even rank as one of Belle Starr's preferred customers, even
in Belle's old place.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this arena is being built to be functional for 50 years,''
Perot added.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe there's future hope, give or take a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Most amazing, however, is Perot's new Belle Starr, if
expectations are met, will finally catch Dallas up with the
Arlingtons, Fort Worths, Grand Prairies and Irvings.
</P>
<P>
   Sports-wise, the fast lane is about to arrive in a city of slow
thinkers.

MAKING DIVISION SERIES BEST-OF-SEVEN ON AGENDA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Baseball's general managers might advocate changing
the division series to a best-of-seven format rather than the
current five-game format.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's John Schuerholz said the subject will be discussed
next month at the general managers' annual off-season meetings in
Naples, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the right thing to do,'' Schuerholz said. ``By it's very
nature, a short five-game series doesn't give you as full a look at
the relative strengths and weaknesses of a club as a seven-game
series does.''
</P>
<P>
   The World Series has been best-of-seven since 1921. The League
Championship Series was a best-of-five until going to the
seven-game format in 1985.
Brown prefers NL
</P>
<P>
   Padres pitcher Kevin Brown is eligible for free agency after the
season and said he would prefer to pitch in the National League.
But he doesn't rule out the Rangers, who are looking to add
starting pitching in the off-season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not ruling out anybody and we're not putting any team
ahead of another,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Brown has pitched for four teams in the past five years. He won
21 games for the Rangers in 1992, but was 7-9 with a 4.82
earned-run average in 1994 before leaving as a free agent. He spent
one year with Baltimore, then flourished in the National League. He
is 51-25 with a 2.33 ERA over the past three seasons, two with the
Marlins and one with the Padres.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to say I do enjoy the game in the National League more,
because the pitchers are more involved,'' Brown said. ``We may not
hit very well, but we get to take \Rbatting practice\S and it's
fun. The style of play I do enjoy more, no doubt.''
He said it
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this business-type attitude hasn't gotten the job
done. I fully expect every time we do something good, for guys to
get off the bench. I think the team needs to thrive on these
situations and let off a little steam.'' _ Braves third baseman
Chipper Jones.

Russian Communists and labor unionists lining up during a
demonstration near Red Square in Moscow on Wednesday to protest
Boris Yeltsin's rule. Along with a road block in Vladivostok, the
protests drew only a small fraction of the 10 million demonstrators
the Communists had expected. And while thousands of factories and
companies conducted short, symbolic work stoppages, life went on as
usual. (Gleb Kosorukov/New York Times Photo)

Sen. Alfonse D'Amato are locked in an extraordinarily tight race
for the U.S. Senate. The outcome apparently rests with a small

Morgan Williams, head of Canford Audio, shown in his company's

fallen because the strong British pound makes his products more
expensive for foreign buyers. (Jonathan Player/New York Times

AN ISLAMIC REMINDER OF THE SACRED IN DESIGN  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 11) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By HERBERT MUSCHAMP   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Aga Khan: the name shimmers with glamour. Fabulous wealth.
Palatial houses. Racehorses. Yachts. Jewels. Royal prerogative. As
if that weren't enough, the Aga Khan is also the most important
figure in the world of architecture today. In a ceremony at the
Alhambra in Spain last Friday, Prince Karim Aga Khan honored seven
buildings and urban plans, winners of the 1998 Aga Khan Awards for
Architecture.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1977 with the relatively modest aim of raising the
standards of modern building in the Islamic world, the awards
program has since become far more significant. By focusing the
attention of Western architects, planners, historians, critics and
the public on new building in the developing Islamic world, he has
created a dynamic forum for defining architecture's place in the
global culture emerging in the wake of the cold war.
</P>
<P>
   Though less well known than the Pritzker Architecture Prize _
often described as architecture's Nobel _ the Aga Khan's awards
program has embraced a far broader cultural mission. Unlike the
Pritzker Prize, the Aga Khan awards go to projects, not architects.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to appraising esthetic merit, jurors assess social
needs, economic growth, environmental impact and the relationship
between local traditions and innovations in contemporary
architecture worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   This year, for example, the winners include the restoration of
Hebron Old Town on the West Bank, the design of a leper hospital in
Chopda Taluka, India, a new arts center in Lahore, Pakistan, and
Tuwaiq Palace, a recreation center for the diplomatic quarter in
Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   The range of projects is typical of those awarded in previous
years. They adhere to no esthetic school, historical style or
theoretical doctrine. But they do expand ideas on architecture
beyond Western frames of reference. And they alter the context in
which even Western buildings should be appraised.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, the awards program has created an opportunity for
Westerners to reckon with the withdrawal of architecture's
spiritural dimension from the public realm.
</P>
<P>
   In his commencement address at Brown University in 1996, the Aga
Khan observed, ``For all Muslims, the concepts of Din and Dunya,
Faith and World, are inextricably linked.'' At 61, the Aga Kahn is
imam, or leader, of the Ismaili sect of Shia Muslims, an affluent
group of about 13 million members who reside mainly in India,
Pakistan, Bangladesh, Kenya, Egypt, the former Soviet Republics and
other communities worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   He traces his descent from Mohammed through Fatima, the
Prophet's daughter. A man of independent wealth, he also receives
tithes from his followers and uses the money to support public
works in Ismaili communities.
</P>
<P>
   As imam, the Aga Khan is responsible for the material as well as
the spiritual well-being of his followers. Based at his Secretariat
in Chantilly, less than an hour from Paris, the prince exercises
his authority through the Aga Khan Development Network, a group of
organizations that relies extensively on volunteers in Ismaili
communities.
</P>
<P>
   The prince's interest in architecture began with his experience
as a dissatisfied client, frustrated with the poor quality of the
schools, hospitals, housing and other projects he had commissioned
to serve Ismaili communities. Since then, he has also established a
program to restore historic cities, including buildings in Cairo,
Zanzibar and Samarkand, and funded the study of Islamic
architecture at Harvard and the University of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   I first learned of the awards in the late 1980s in Mimar, the
prince's sumptuously produced magazine dedicated to new buildings
and restoration projects in the Islamic world (alas, it has since
ceased publication).
</P>
<P>
   Another royal, the Prince of Wales, was then making waves with
attacks on modern architecture that were little more than dim
appeals to reactionary taste.
</P>
<P>
   Like the British prince, the Aga Kahn sought to build upon
architectural traditions But his approach was dramatically
different. Instead of villainizing modernity as the enemy of
history, he grasped that modernization is a part of history. He
perceived that nothing historically significant could be achieved
by merely hating the present.
</P>
<P>
   The British and the Ismaili prince share one overarching
concern: the withdrawal of architecture's sacred dimension from the
public realm. Architecture is traditionally an art form of the
rich, but it is also a medium that since prehistoric times has been
used to stake a place for spiritual values in everyday life.

   As recently as the late 19th century, the design of
ecclesiastical buildings played a central role in British
architectural discourse. Today that focus has all but vanished. The
extent to which its disappearance has made ours a time of mourning
is perhaps not fully realized.
</P>
<P>
   I went to Turkey to look at a small group of projects that have
received the Aga Khan Award for architecture over the years. My
itinerary included a mosque in Ankara, a reforestation program
outside the Turkish capital, a park in Istanbul and a group of
vacation houses in the Aegean resort town of Bodrum, under the
guidance of Suhah Ascan, an architect who directs the program from
the Geneva offices of the Aga Khan Trust for Culture.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey is not, as a matter of fact, a center of Ismaili life.
Since 1922 it has been ruled, if at times tenuously, by a secular
government. But, as a country that has long symbolized the
threshhold between East and West, it is steeped in the
cross-cultural spirit that guides the awards program.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   I wanted to look at buildings outside the superpower frame of
reference, to step outside the membrane that has come to enclose
much of American architecture within the environment of consumer
fantasy. What drew me to the awards program initially was the
belief that the end of the cold war had precipitated a crisis for
American architecture, urbanism, and those who write about these
fields.
</P>
<P>
   After World War II, architects enjoyed substantial moral
authority, a reflection of their simultaneous commitment to
creative discipline and social responsibility. Much of that
authority has evaporated. Today, American architecture often
resembles an infernal bubble machine run by evil clowns.
</P>
<P>
   Amusement parks with swan hotels, Egyptian gambling casinos,
pseudo-urban shopping malls, gated communities, pasteboard versions
of history with comic book historians to endorse them. It is as if
all the energy once exerted to contain Soviet aggression has
imploded, enclosing the world's superpower within the bubbular
fantasy that a changing world can be understood by dominating it,
monitoring it, contacting it through cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   I'm finding it hard to focus on the architecture because I can't
figure out why Can is still wearing his tan loafers. We're in a
mosque, for heaven's sake. I've left my shoes outside, and I'm not
even Muslim. Is Can trying to make a statement? Or perhaps the
gaffe is mine. Maybe you're supposed to wear shoes in a mosque
attached to the Turkish equivalent of our Capitol building: the
legislative heart of a modern secular state. Both are reasonable
conjectures.
</P>
<P>
   The building itself makes a political statement. It was
deliberately designed to reinforce the secular government against
those who would see Turkey ruled by clerical law.
</P>
<P>
   Designed by Behruz Cinici, in association with his son, the
stubbornly shod Can, the concrete building is situated on the
secular equivalent of sacred soil. The assembly's 1930s buildings,
in modern classical style, embody the political legacy of Ataturk,
modern Turkey's founder. Cinici, a student of the assembly's
architect, declared he would not design a conventional mosque on
Ataturk's land.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of Mies van der Rohe's design for the Illinois
Institution of Technology campus once complained that you can't
distinguish the chapel from the boiler plant. The assembly's mosque
distances itself even further from the conventions of sacred
architecture. It deliberately inverts the elements of traditional
mosque design.
</P>
<P>
   In many mosques, the entrance is approached through an open
arcade that partly screens the main facade. Here, there is nothing
but a long row of concrete pedestals _ symbolic bases of the
columns that the architects have declined to provide.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of a dome, the roof mounts in low steps to form an
elongated ziggurat. Clerestories between the levels admit light
into the prayer hall below. On the right side of the building,
where a minaret would typically rise, a set of steps leads up to
two platforms, both open to the sky.
</P>
<P>
   The mosque's most unconventional element is visible from within
the prayer hall. Instead of facing a solid wall, kneeling
worshipers face a large glass window and, beyond it, a sumptuous,
multilevel sunken garden with pools, fountains, trees, a waterfall
and a profusion of water plants. It is a representation of
paradise, an image of the afterlife to which devout Muslims aspire.
</P>
<P>
   Can Cinici tells me that for Muslims, life is a threshhold at
which we stand, preparing ourselves throughout life, through faith
and devotion, for entrance into heaven. The Canicis designed an
architectural interpretation of that theshhold. Beyond the garden,
one beholds the earth berm, an intimation of death and burial.
</P>
<P>
   I like the threshhold image, not only as a key to this
building's meaning, but as a metaphor for the awards program
itself, as a doorway into realms of deeper understanding of the
post-cold war world. The awards are presented every three years,
after a selection process that is elaborate, well-financed and
rigorous. Several hundred nominations are proposed by a network of
architects and critics throughout the Islamic world.
</P>
<P>
   An international master jury meets in Geneva to review the
nominees and make an initial cut. Experts conduct extensive field
research on the finalists. The jury picks the winners at a second
review in Geneva six months later.
</P>
<P>
   The composition of the master jury changes with each cycle. Over
the years, non-Muslims on the panel have included Charles Corea,
Peter Eisenman, Frank Gehry, Hans Hollein, Fumihiko Maki, Charles
Moore, Alvaro Siza, James Stirling, Kenzo Tange and Robert Venturi.
Excerpts from the jury's deliberations are published in book form.
These are adding up to a permanent record of the impact of global
change on the art of creating place.
</P>
<P>
   But why is Can still wearing his shoes? (Because, I later
learned, he was flustered by showing a Western journalist around
his building.) Or, why does this building continue to cause
anxiety?
</P>
<P>
   Just months before my trip, last year, the Turkish military
intervened to prevent the ruling party from mandating religious
education in the nation's public schools. The ground occupied by
the mosque, in other words, is contested as well as sacred space.
Here, formal invention serves architecture's unparalleled power to
open the pores to history and meaning.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1961, one million trees have been planted annually on the
hills outside Ankara: pine, cedar, oak, poplar, almond and plum.
The 11,000-acre-plus project of the Middle East Technical Institute
has altered the city's climate, creating milder winters and summers
and helping to decrease air pollution. The forest has also become a
haven for abundant life and an oasis for the eyes.

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The game turned, as so many do, on a bad call by an
American League umpire. A would-be classic baseball game became
another reason to revamp the system that assigns the men in blue.
</P>
<P>
   The Cleveland Indians beat the Yankees, 4-1, in 12 innings of
Game 2 of the AL Championship Series Wednesday night. There were
numerous heroes and goats as the Tribe knotted the series, 1-1, but
home plate umpire Ted Hendry _ nicknamed Heads or Tails Hendry by
one AL manager _ made himself the story when he missed a call and
opened the gates for the Indians in the 12th.
</P>
<P>
   Hendry's sin was not calling interference on Cleveland's Travis
Fryman, who failed to stay in the proper baserunning lane as he ran
out a sacrifice bunt with one on and none out in the 12th. Yankee
first baseman Tino Martinez's throw hit Fryman in the back, and
pinch runner Enrique Wilson scored from first as Yankee second
baseman Chuck Knoblauch stood arguing.
</P>
<P>
   We should mention here that umpires for the postseason are
assigned according to rotation. Merit has nothing to do with it.
You ump the playoffs simply because it is your turn. This in part
explains the continuing calamity of officiating in baseball's big
event.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to go all the way back to Larry Barnett's gaffe
in the 1975 World Series _ a noncall of interference that helped
the Reds beat the Red Sox. You can just return to 1996 when Richie
Garcia didn't see Jeffrey Maier reach over the fence and turn a
Derek Jeter fly ball into a home run in the ALCS. Better yet, go
back to last week when Joe Brinkman lost control of the second game
of the Red Sox-Cleveland Division Series. AL umps are the most
incompetent group of officials in professional sports. They answer
only to their union chief, Richie Phillips. And their arrogance is
boundless.
</P>
<P>
   The play Wednesday night went like this: Wilson was on first
when Fryman bunted down the first base line. Martinez fielded the
ball but hesitated as Fryman ran on the infield grass toward first
base. The rule states that the baserunner has to stay on the right
side of the baseline once he gets to the halfway mark. Fryman did
not. When Martinez finally threw, the ball hit Fryman on the back
just as he was getting to the base. Knoblauch, ordinarily a
heads-up player, compounded the woe by standing and arguing with
the umps instead of chasing the ball. Wilson scored from first and
the Tribe were en route to a three-run inning.
</P>
<P>
   Yankee manager Joe Torre made no attempt to hide his disgust.
``(Hendry) gave me some kind of reasoning that (Fryman) had to get
out of those restraining lines to touch the base, but he was never
in those lines. It was so blatant. It was a terrible call. For one
guy to say what he saw and for another guy (first base umpire John
Shulock) to swear by it, and meanwhile, you have it on video. You
know the video's going to embarrass you. He was on the grass all
the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Crew chief Jim Evans, the man with whom Pedro Martinez feuded
all year, said, ``You can be in fair territory. There is nothing
illegal about going to the pitcher's mound on your way to the base.
The question is, do you interfere with a throw? If he did, then we
got a different situation. In professional baseball, if the runner
is in fair territory, then he can be called out if he interferes
with a throw that has a chance to retire the runner. In this case,
the problem happened right at the base. That is what Ted Hendry
based his ruling on _ the fact that he has a right to be in fair
territory at the base. It's not a visual obstruction-type play.
They used to teach catchers to throw and hit the runner.''
</P>
<P>
   After 10 minutes of doublespeak, Evans finally said, ``I thought
the call could have gone either way, but I thought he made the
proper call in that siutation.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland manager Mike Hargrove, not one to rock the boat when
the umps erred in his favor, said, ``I thought it was the right
call. I might not have thought that if I was on the other side. We
don't care how we get the win as long as it's ours.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre wasn't afraid to address the larger issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the best umpires should be here on merit,'' he said.
``The ball-and-strike stuff stunk tonight, but that stunk for both
sides. I don't think you could have reached a lot of these pitches
with bamboo sticks. He was bad on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cleveland's a good team, and you would have liked for the
thing to be clean. But you got to have better umpiring than that.
It leaves a bad taste. It's bad for baseball. That particular play
was so blatant. I'm not sure we'd have won the game, but you don't
want to lose it that way.''
</P>
<P>
   And so the series is tied. It's New York 1, Cleveland 1, Umpires
0.

 UNDATED: the eyes.

   But perhaps the major impact of the forest has been to limit
urban sprawl. Turkish law forbids the development of forest land.
Like the mosque's sunken garden, the forest offers a vision of
paradise, but the delights here are earthly as well. The forest
offers greenery in a desert, a parched terrain of banal housing
that spreads outward from Ankara's urban core.
</P>
<P>
   At the Technical University, classes are conducted in English,
campus buildings are designed in the Brutalist style and
architectural instruction is derived from the Bauhaus model. It
strikes me that the reforestation program lies partly within the
tradition of British Arts and Crafts.
</P>
<P>
   Like that movement, the program is grounded in the values of
simplicity, social reform and truth to materials; in rejection of
the shoddy and the ornate. Arts and Crafts was more than a style.
No other movement declared more emphatically the withdrawal of the
religious dimension from the public sphere.
</P>
<P>
   With it, belief withdrew into the sanctity of the home, the
privacy of what we now call life style. It is heartening to see
that tradition revived on the urban scale of collective expression.
</P>
<P>
   The Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, one of the Seven Wonders of the
World, is now a big pit in the back streets of Bodrum, a hip resort
town on the Aegean coast. In the early 15th century, Crusaders
pillaged the Mausoleum, quarrying it for stone to build the Castle
of St. John, a fortress that still stands on a mole in the harbor.
But enough rubble was left lying around in the 19th century to
construct two small stone houses built on the waterfront. These are
now the property of the record producer Ahmet Ertegun and his wife
Mica, who remodeled the buildings in 1973 with the architect Turgut
Cansever.
</P>
<P>
   On the ground floor, the rooms are cool and white, with high
ceilings and floors strewn with blue and white striped cushions.
The bedrooms, lodged in a newer annex, are more richly decorated.
</P>
<P>
   The old buildings and the new enclose a garden of enchantment.
It covers a small area, but tall trees are mingled with short ones
and the foliage bursts out at eye level, creating an effect at once
infinite and intimate. Mausoleus was a tyrant, and the Crusaders
were terrorists. It's a joy to see these ancient stones recycled
into a house rebuilt by jazz.
</P>
<P>
   After an afternoon in this garden, it comes as a letdown to
visit another award-winning project, the Demir Holiday Village,
also designed by Turgut Cansever. Like Seaside in Florida, this
resort offers itself as a model for urban development. And like the
reforestation program, it was designed to limit sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   In two decades, Bodrum has gone through a San Tropez-style
transformation, from fishing village and hippie colony to a booming
resort that makes South Beach look sleepy. The hills surrounding
the harbor bristle with stumpy white apartment buildings of no
distinction.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the holiday village is compact, its houses unified
by stone walls, terraces and stairs that organize the dwellings in
a staggered arrangement on the hillside site. It's a rustic
Habitat, Acapulco on Alka-Seltzer.
</P>
<P>
   If you care about architecture, this is the sort of project
you're supposed to admire. But the rooms in the houses are
minuscule, the sun is gone from the water in the afternoon, and the
entire complex is so tight and repressed that you want to blare a
transistor radio and race back to the sprawl. Why bother with
Bodrum if you want to be square? I'm glad to see that Turkey has
bubbles too.
</P>
<P>
   Completed in 1856, Dolmabahce Palace is the superbubble of a
burnt-out superpower, the last seat of the Ottoman rulers before
the sultanate was dissolved in 1922. An imperial palace can feel
like a desert, too. The grandiosity of this European-style palace
is more oppressive than Death Valley.
</P>
<P>
   It is one gigantic package of everything that Arts and Crafts
designers rebelled against, 25-ton crystal chandeliers, bear skin
rugs (gifts from the Czar), diamond-encrusted demitasse cups,
gilded moldings, red brocade. Just climbing the Crystal Staircase,
with its Baccarat balustrade, can induce reverse vertigo: you fear
you won't make it to the top.
</P>
<P>
   This is the center of an empire rapidly devolving into the
so-called Sick Man of Europe, a nation whose assets and interests
were dominated by businessmen and politicians of the major European
powers.
</P>
<P>
   But the Aga Khan Award wasn't presented to this project for
interior decoration. Rather, the award honored the restoration of
the palace gardens and the decision to open them to the public.
Istanbul is not rich in parks, and this is a fine one.
</P>
<P>
   The palace stands at the mouth of the Bosphorus. An esplanade,
with five water gates, is one of world's great river walks. Among
Istanbul's public spaces, I prefer the square between the Hagia
Sophia and the Blue Mosque, where people come to sit on benches and
contemplate great buildings. But, for a native of the eastern
United States, it is a thrilling reversal to gaze westward across
water toward the European shore.
</P>
<P>
   ``One can't write directly about the soul,'' Virginia Woolf
states in her diary. ``Looked at, it vanishes. But look at the
ceiling, at the cheaper beasts in the Zoo which are exposed to
walkers in Regents Park, and the soul slips in.''

<P>
   On the way back to New York, I stop off in Paris to pay my
respects to the Aga Khan in Chantilly. It also happens that the one
Western building to receive an Aga Khan award is in a Left Bank
riverside location at the foot of the Boulevard Saint Germain. Jean
Nouvel is an architect I greatly admire, but I've never been a fan
of his Arab World Institute. Each time I enter this visually cool,
gunmetal gray building, the body temperature drops.
</P>
<P>
   But the institute's lozenge shape makes good use of its site,
and the views from its rooftop restaurant outclass those from the
Tour d'Argent. And the building makes a historical point. Its most
noted feature is a south-facing sunscreen wall made up of hundreds
of light-sensitive irises, which was designed to control the light
entering the building.
</P>
<P>
   Arranged in blocks fitted into a grid, the irises form patterns
resembling arabesques: a reminder that Western technology arose
from the genius of Islamic mathematicians. We've taken that
inspiration in more than one direction. The irises stopped working
within weeks of the building's opening, but we still love the image
of science even when appliances break down. And, to me, Nouvel's
arctic architecture is a fine thermal symbol of the chilly
rationalist philosophy for which Paris was long the supreme urban
center.
</P>
<P>
   I feel as if I've been traveling around inside one of
architecture's most interesting minds, but the Aga Khan's Chantilly
compound feels oddly bland. The road winds through a lovely, leafy
park. Stables to the right; the prince's house to the right; the
secretariat just ahead, the latter blonde in effect. Tawny
limestone walls; floors of honey-colored marble; ecru carpeting;
brass accents. Only the small foyer to the prince's office,
encrusted with a collection of mineral crystals, gives an Oriental
impression. Inside, chairs and sofas are upholstered in blue and
white.
</P>
<P>
   I came here to run two ideas by the prince. Can he confirm my
impression that his interest in architecture stems from that art's
capacity to unite spirit and matter in the landscape of everyday
life? Yes, he answered, his eyes lighting up, as if to suggest that
no point is more fundamental to his thinking.
</P>
<P>
   And what about using the threshhold as a metaphor for this
story? This idea he rejected. It evoked for him images of conquest,
of crossing a border with the intention of colonizing the territory
on the other side. The threshhold also implies terrain left behind
_ epochs, values, roots. Neither image fits the prince's mission.
His aim, rather, has been to create a meeting ground for cultural
exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics have said that the buildings commissioned by the
Aga Kahn are still not up the level of the projects honored by his
awards. Others have wondered whether the money it takes to run the
program might not be better spent on actual buildings. Both
criticisms miss the point. The aim of the awards program is to
construct a world view, and this is priceless.
</P>
<P>
   With a morning plane to catch, I had no time to pretend that I
was actually visiting Paris. But before turning in I decided to
walk down to the Seine and see its banks bathed in the harsh glare
of the bateaux mouches. There, I encountered something unexpected:
an impromptu memorial to Princess Diana, sculptured from thousands
of letters, cards, flowers and photographs.
</P>
<P>
   These were massed around the base of the replica of Liberty's
torch that stands on the quai at the bottom of the Avenue George V.
Visitors replenish offerings there to this day.
</P>
<P>
   The princess had died the night before I left New York for
Turkey, and since I'd been out of touch with the news, I hadn't
heard about the cascades of grief generated by her death.
Surprising, too, was the volume of cards and letters written in
Arabic script. ``Pour Diana, Reine d'Islam,'' one large placard
read.
</P>
<P>
   Like the princess's death, the site of the memorial was an
accident of fate; the torch stands at the entrance to the Alma
Tunnel, where the car in which Diana was riding spun out of control
and crashed. But I thought it paradoxically apt that this public
expression of grief was clustered around this golden symbol of
liberty, of French Enlightenment values and their passage to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Those values included religious freedom, and even the right to
be free of religion in the public sphere. This is a cherished
principle of modern democracy, an idea to be defended with vigor.
Yet it seemed to me that more than a princess was being mourned
here. Our separation of Faith from World has also left a void,
fleetingly filled by this collective floral tribute.

RIVERBOAT GAMBLING INDICTMENTS EXPECTED SOON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CURTIS WILKIE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Former Governor Edwin W. Edwards, his son, and
several of his political associates are expected to be indicted
within days, sources close to the case said Wednesday, in
connection with a scheme to award Louisiana's last
riverboat-gambling license to a company headed by San Francisco
49ers owner Edward DeBartolo Jr.
</P>
<P>
   The action would represent the latest step in a long federal
investigation of Edwards that has roiled Louisiana's political
waters since public revelations in spring 1997 that FBI agents
seized a $400,000 cash payment from DeBartolo to Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   It would be the third time in two decades that the flamboyant
Edwards has faced federal charges. Edwards, 71, was twice tried on
racketeering charges while he was governor in the 1980s and was
found not guilty.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday Edwars maintained his innocence following a court
hearing in which DeBartolo pleaded guilty and admitted that Edwards
had demanded a payoff for his efforts to win the gambling license.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had victimized him, I would have done it for a lot more
than $400,000,'' said Edwards, who attended the hearing as a
spectator. Outside the courtroom, he called DeBartolo ``the new
Linda Tripp.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards and his son are expected to be indicted on extortion
charges in federal court in Baton Rouge, the sources said, while
several associates are to be indicted in connection with the
handling of DeBartolo's money.
</P>
<P>
   While the case provides new peril for Edwards, it also throws
the state's troubled gambling industry into further disarray.
According to transcripts of Edwards's conversations that were
captured by federal wiretaps, the former governor talked of
delivering the votes of the state Gaming Control Board.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this taint hanging over the Gaming Control Board, we
don't know what will happen,'' said C.B. Forgotston, the leading
critic of gambling in Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   The board was scheduled to rule later this month on a proposal
by a Harrah's subsidiary to reorganize after bankruptcy. A
favorable move would enable Harrah's to resume construction of a
giant casino in New Orleans. The project, once called the world's
largest casino, has been held in abeyance for nearly two years.
</P>
<P>
   When the state legalized gambling earlier in the decade,
provisions were made for 15 riverboat casinos and one huge
land-based gambling emporium here. Unlike neighboring Mississippi,
which gives licenses to all qualified applicants and operates a
gambling industry that has been profitable and relatively free of
corruption, battles for the limited number of licenses in Louisiana
have touched off political infighting and brought cries of
favoritism.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, a high-stakes gambler who is a frequent visitor to Las
Vegas and once escorted two planeloads of contributors on a
gambling expedition to Europe, presided over the legalization of
gambling in the last of his four terms as governor.
</P>
<P>
   According to documents submitted in federal court in Baton Rouge
this week by US Attorney Eddie Jordan, the governor called
DeBartolo in December 1994, reminded him of his friendship with
DeBartolo's late father, who owned a fashionable shopping center in
New Orleans, and expressed the hope that he would continue to have
what Edwards called a ``business'' relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Several conversations between Edwards and DeBartolo took place
after Edwards left office at the end of 1995, at a time when
DeBartolo was involved in a joint venture to win the state's 15th
and final riverboat license.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say an officer of DeBartolo Entertainment Louisiana
Gaming Inc., a wing of the DeBartolo family enterprises, is
prepared to testify that Edwards and his son, Stephen Edwards,
first called for a $50,000-a-month ``sham consulting agreement''
that would funnel money to Edwards's son. Edwards also wanted a
``price-per-head'' for each customer at the prospective casino, the
prosecution papers contend.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting with DeBartolo at a Baton Rouge hotel in March
1997, Edwards was said to have shown a sheet of paper with the
figure $400,000 written on it. According to the prosecutors,
Edwards told DeBartolo ``he needed the money before the vote, and,
if he did not receive it, there could be problems with the
application.''
</P>
<P>
   DeBartolo agreed to cooperate with prosecutors in order to get a
light sentence, two years probation coupled with fines and
forfeitures that add up to $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, the chief prosecutor, called upon other witnesses to
board ``a train that's leaving the station, the train of justice.''
</P>
<P>
   DeBartolo, meanwhile, said he hoped to be able to regain control
of the 49ers, a position he relinquished after he came under
investigation.

DANDY WHO MAKES DATED SEEM CUTTING-EDGE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 11) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 Martin Filler writes on art and architecture for House Beautiful
and The New York Review of Books. 
By MARTIN FILLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ When Stephen Calloway opened the front door of his
seedy Georgian terrace house in the Camberwell section of south
London not long ago, it was easy to imagine one was being greeted
by the original owner.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a Vandyke beard with twirled, waxed mustache and a
dashingly cut 19th-century-style suit that would have made the
foppish Benjamin Disraeli swoon, Calloway, 47, an art historian and
design consultant, smiled apologetically at the imposing but
ramshackle structure into which he had moved a few months earlier.
``Somewhere under all the horrors are two 1790s houses struggling
to get out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the grand tradition of English eccentrics, Calloway has made
his passion for the past into a way of life so convincingly
anachronistic that an afternoon spent with him discussing his most
recent project seems like a step back into the vanished world he
has been obsessed with since he was a child.
</P>
<P>
   An associate curator of drawings and prints at the Victoria and
Albert Museum, he organized the Aubrey Beardsley retrospective that
opened there Thursday, to mark the centenary of the artist's death.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition of more than 200 works, most drawn from the
museum's extensive Beardsley holdings, remains on view through Jan.
10.
</P>
<P>
   In a ground-floor sitting room of the adjacent houses he was
connecting and renovating with his wife, the decorative artist and
ceramist Oriel Harwood (from whom he recently separated after 12
years of marriage), Calloway sank into a velvet Knole sofa and
spoke of the continuing influence of the subject of his show.
</P>
<P>
   ``People reinvent Beardsley to fit their own ideas,'' he said.
``Thirty years ago his work all seemed decadent and androgynous. It
somehow struck a chord with the whole explosion of 60s graphics.
Now he's being looked at more as a protomodernist, and the idea
that he's a very radical artist is somehow appealing again.''
</P>
<P>
   For many of Calloway's generation, Beardsley remains
inextricably linked with memories of dorm rooms reeking of incense
and hung with black-and-white posters of the artist's Salome, Ali
Baba and other icons of the 60s Art Nouveau revival. But younger
viewers, Calloway feels, will be able to find much that is relevant
to them in the work of that tragic but hugely prolific figure, who
died of tuberculosis at 25.
</P>
<P>
   The intensity with which 1990s artists have focused on the body,
sexuality, gender and personal identity gives Beardsley a new
topicality, quite different from 60s nostalgia for the linear
languor of Art Nouveau as seen through the distorting lens of
polymorphous-perverse psychedelia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beardsley was one of the first artists to confront sexuality
head on,'' Calloway maintained. ``The closest recent parallel, I
suppose, is Robert Mapplethorpe, in the way he uses absolutely
explicit imagery in a rather cool manner. They're both masters of
black and white and share a similar temperament, that dispassionate
way of producing things which are actually extremely outrageous.
And the fact that they both died young has a curious new resonance
as a result of AIDS and the linking of sex and death. Nobody ever
appeared to die of sex in the 1960s, when it was the main aim of
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, as Calloway pointed out, Beardsley could be naughtily
subversive, as when his publisher asked him to redo a drawing of
John Bull to make it ``more robust.'' In his revised version, the
artist appended a tiny but unmistakable erection beneath the
patriotic figure's breeches, a detail that escaped notice until
after the reproduction was distributed.
</P>
<P>
   On other occasions, his work was frankly pornographic. His
notorious series of illustrations for Aristophanes' ``Lysistrata''
and the ``Satires'' of Juvenal, in which enormous phalluses,
masturbation, flagellation and flagrant sexual posturing of all
sorts are portrayed, still have the power to startle. Those
long-forbidden works aroused particular anxiety in publicly
puritanical Japan, where the Victoria and Albert exhibition
traveled to four cities earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Japanese see their own art reflected in Beardsley,''
Calloway explained of his subject, whose Japanomania was widely
shared in the British art world during the Esthetic Movement. ``But
they like his macabre subject matter as well, and the graphic
clarity of it. The way I structured the exhibition was to put most
of the obscene drawings in one group, because historically it's
where they belong. That section is titled ``All Obscene Drawings,''
from the last letter Beardsley wrote on his deathbed, which should
be enough of a warning. Funnily enough, the one piece the Japanese
refused to show was an erotic shunga print by Utamaro, which
Beardsley is known to have owned. Perhaps they saw their own
sexuality a little too clearly in it.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Beardsley's transgressive tendencies can be found even in his
seemingly innocuous works. In a new book that accompanies the
exhibition, published by Abrams, Calloway offers illuminating
interpretations of Beardsley's drawings and digs beneath their
deceptively facile surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very keen to see if one could get out as much as I was
convinced Beardsley put into his images,'' the author said. ``I've
always felt that they're absolutely laden with very precise detail
which was telling to an audience of his date. In certain instances
it's very obvious what he's up to, but sometimes he's quite coded.
The more you can bring to it in terms of period knowledge, the more
you can squeeze out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, in discussing the artist's 1894 prospectus for
``The Yellow Book,'' the fin-de-siecle arts journal, Calloway
ponders why its depiction of a stylishly dressed young woman
browsing outside a bookshop at night could stir a Victorian
frisson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elegant and assertive,'' he writes of the fashionable
bibliophile, ``she proclaims her, at best, dubious social position
by the mere fact of her nocturnal shopping expedition, alone and
unchaperoned in the street. As an image of English womanhood, it
was almost guaranteed to shock.''
</P>
<P>
   Calloway, the son of an architect, was born in London, where he
studied art history at University College and the Courtauld
Institute. ``I used to go to the V. and A. by myself from the time
I was 10 and always wanted to be a part of that,'' he said,
recalling Bryan Reade's landmark 1966 Beardsley retrospective at
the museum as a revelation. ``I just naturally gravitated there,
working during school holidays and eventually joining the drawings
and prints department in 1976.''
</P>
<P>
   A big break came when the museum's iconoclastic director, Sir
Roy Strong, asked Calloway to become his assistant, a job the young
man held for five years. The two slightly built, long-haired men
bear a striking resemblance, and both cultivate an over-the-top
dandyism, though Sir Roy's bears a swinging 60s stamp and his
former aide's is more purely antiquarian.
</P>
<P>
   Because many of Calloway's vintage outfits are now too fragile
and valuable for everyday wear, he has them copied by a theatrical
costumer. ``I bought my first pair of spats in Portobello Road
about 1966,'' he remembers. Soon his wardrobe became a veritable
encyclopedia of 19th-century male fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Calloway's familiarity with period modes of dress and deportment
has made him a sought-after historical consultant for recent films
like ``Emma,'' ``Oscar and Lucinda'' and ``The Portrait of a
Lady.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Strangely, I seem to have become an expert on 19th-century
manners, how people should shake hands and eat at table,'' he said.
``It still comes as a bit of a shock when the credits roll to see
oneself listed as `etiquette adviser.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Because of his movie work and other demands on his time _
writing books and magazine articles, lecturing and undertaking
design commissions like the redecoration of London's Marlborough
House for English Heritage _ Calloway now spends only one day a
week at the Victoria and Albert.
</P>
<P>
   ``My activities there are basically esthetic,'' he said,
``choosing colors for the walls, hanging pictures and things like
that, which as far as I'm concerned is the fun part of it. It's the
unbelievable luxury of thinking how you're going to arrange
things.''

`APPALACHIAN SPRING' FINDS RENEWAL IN THE ROCKIES  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 11)

 Jan Ellen Spiegel is a dance writer based in Colorado.

<P>
   DENVER _ As he waited for curtain calls at the gala closing of
the old Metropolitan Opera House in 1966, Martin Fredmann, 23, then
a dancer with the Metropolitan Opera Ballet, felt a pinch on his
bottom. He turned to discover Martha Graham. She gave him a big
wink.
</P>
<P>
   It was the only time Fredmann met Graham. Now artistic director
of Colorado Ballet in Denver, he could probably use another pinch
and wink. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The improbable irony of the intervening years is that Fredmann,
whose background is in classical ballet, is a lynch pin in an
experiment that might give Graham's modern-dance repertory a more
secure lease on life. Next weekend Colorado Ballet presents the
first major production by an American ballet company of a Graham
work when it performs ``Appalachian Spring.''
</P>
<P>
   Selected Graham pieces have been staged by European ballet
companies (Paris Opera Ballet, Dutch National Ballet) and
modern-dance troupes in Israel. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is the first time that ``Appalachian Spring,'' created in
1944 with a commissioned score that won Aaron Copland a Pulitzer
Prize, will be performed by any troupe outside the Martha Graham
Dance Company itself. The Colorado production also coincides with
licensing arrangements for Graham's works under the newly formed
Graham Trust.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Graham company, although more financially pressed than usual
in recent years, does not depend on this formal licensing mechanism
for its survival. But royalties and licensing fees can plow revenue
back into the company. The question is whether a regional ballet
company like Colorado Ballet can properly perform Graham's
nonballetic idiom and thus pave the way for similar companies to
stage Graham performances.
</P>
<P>
   (Two other companies, Hartford Ballet and the Peter Sparling
Company in Ann Arbor, Mich., run by former Graham dancers, have
also been licensed to do Graham works.)
</P>
<P>
   The stakes, not to mention the literal pain of the intense
training Colorado Ballet has undergone since early September, are
keeping more than a few people up at night. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to mess up,'' said Fredmann, whose flashing
blue eyes underscore his swift-talking, shoot-from-the-hip
personality. Despite his anxiety, he has declared this Graham
experiment to be the most enlightening experience of his dance
life. ``I care about it too much, too deeply, and everybody who's
involved cares about it too much and too deeply,'' he said.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The honor will cost Fredmann's company about $30,000, not
including dancers' salaries, for six performances. Under his
agreement with the Graham Trust, ``Appalachian Spring,'' an ode to
the spirit and land of the American West, is licensed to him for
two years.
</P>
<P>
   There are additional charges for performances in its second
year. Fredmann would not divulge the exact licensing fee, other
than to say that it is more than he normally pays for pieces from
the similarly constructed Balanchine Trust. His agreement with the
Graham Trust includes acquiring two more works in the next five
years.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado Ballet is ostensibly an odd choice to initiate the
Trust. About a third of its dancers come from areas once part of
the Soviet Union; all are classically trained. The catalyst in this
odd union was Richard Philp, editor in chief of Dance magazine; he
is a friend to both Fredmann and Ron Protas, the artistic director
of the Graham company, who acquired the rights to Graham's works
after her death in 1991. Protas was enthusiastic about a regional
company's performing Graham's dances. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt that a lot of the power and creativity in dance today
is in the regional area,'' Protas explained. ``I met Martin and I
knew some of their work. And I like him and I liked them and I went
out to see the company with Janet'' _ Janet Eilber, artistic
co-director of the Trust _ ``and I felt their freshness and their
openness. And Martin is very dedicated, very passionate, and would
kill himself to maintain standards. I would not have let them do
`Appalachian Spring' if I thought they couldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Which didn't exactly allay Fredmann's fears that his company
couldn't pull off a quality performance. But Protas reassured him.
As Fredmann recalled it: ``He said, `Don't worry.' He said, `I
don't expect you to do it like Graham; you're Colorado Ballet.' He
said, `Yes, I want you to do it well with the motivation, the
understanding, the dramatic depth.' But he said: `The only way this
work is going to live and continue is that it continues to grow.
And each company will do it the way each company does it. It's not
going to be museumized. No work is. ``Sleeping Beauty'' isn't done
that way. Beethoven's not played that way. It's the same great
music, the same great Martha.' '' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The notion of a ballet company's doing a Graham piece is not
far-fetched. ``Appalachian Spring,'' which was Fredmann's choice,
was choreographed with Erick Hawkins, a ballet dancer in the lead
male role. Mikhail Baryshnikov and Rudolf Nureyev have danced the
piece with the Graham company.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Colorado dancers had been warned by Meelis Pakri, a company
member, about the rigors of Graham technique. He had danced the
husbandman's role in May in the Graham company's 54th-anniversary
performance of ``Appalachian Spring'' at the Library of Congress.
He will reprise the role with Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   But within days, the technique's pelvic contraction and release,
spiral-based movement, floor-centered style and clear but sweeping
focus left Colorado dancers with hamstring muscles so sore they
could barely climb steps. Kneepads were common at rehearsal as
dancers learned Graham's knee-based movements.
</P>
<P>
   ``What doesn't hurt?'' the dancers responded in unison to the
question of their physical well-being two weeks into their six-week
rehearsal. Gregory Gonzales, dancing the revivalist's role, pointed
to a pinhead-size spot and said, ``This place on my elbow doesn't
hurt.'' He grinned.
</P>
<P>
   But it was no laughing matter for Maria Mosina, the
Bolshoi-trained ballerina selected to dance the bride's role. She
was so distressed after the first few days of training that she
wanted to quit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a foreign language to us,'' she said with
translation assistance from Pakri. ``Basically, all the motions are
in opposition to ballet.''
</P>
<P>
   Terese Capucilli, a nearly 20-year veteran of the Graham company
and a noted interpreter of Graham's own roles, directed the first
two weeks of rehearsal, which included technique training and
setting the ballet. It was followed by coaching from Joyce Herring,
a former Graham dancer, and touch-up work by Protas.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to realize,'' Ms. Capucilli said, ``a Russian
ballerina, suddenly looking at herself in the mirror with an
inverted leg and a contraction in her body when she's trained for
years and years to do just the opposite. Maria came around when we
started to really get into the core of her work and when she
started to understand where the technique, as it applies to
`Spring,' could help her through.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Capucilli told the Colorado dancers that she did not intend
to make Graham dancers out of them. Rather, she wanted to instill
in them the basic Graham technique needed specifically for
``Appalachian Spring'' and then work with them from the emotional
inner life of the piece, which was always most important to Graham
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the dancers right off,'' she said, ``that I was not
interested in superficially placing movement on their bodies, but
to take what these dancers know as artists. They're very
beautifully trained ballet dancers. What they know about the stage,
what they know about standing on one leg, does not change when the
top leg becomes a parallel leg or when the contraction takes the
breath out of the body.''
</P>
<P>
   Protas had given Ms. Capucilli license to make some adjustments
to suit Colorado Ballet's abilities, but it was unnecessary. By the
end of her two weeks, the dancers, sore as they were, had the
movement down, even if they had not yet found the freedom to give
the piece the earthbound yet soaring tones that punctuate it.
</P>
<P>
   Even more daunting to Ms. Capucilli, an intense and deeply
passionate perfectionist trained by Graham herself, was the weight
of the responsibility she felt to succeed with Colorado Ballet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very frightening coming here,'' she said. ``Martha's
work can withstand bad interpretation, but I wasn't willing to
think that it would go that route. The only thing I could do as the
person who is staging this work was to set the highest goals for
myself, for the work, for the company, otherwise I could not live
with it, live with the fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way I could do that was to give them a piece of my
heart and what it is I love about the technique and love about the
work so that they could somehow find a place for themselves in it.
I can only tear my soul apart for them to see.''

NASA DEFENDS AID TO RUSSIA FOR SPACE STATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By WARREN E. LEARY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Members of Congress expressed doubts about Russia's
continued role in the international space station Wednesday as NASA
officials defended plans to help Russia finish important components
of the program and reduce future dependence on the cash-strapped
nation in completing the orbiting outpost.
</P>
<P>
   NASA Administrator Daniel Goldin said plans to pay Russia $660
million over four years for equipment and services connected with
the space station were necessary to save the multinational project,
and that additional money would be needed to pay other added costs,
most of them caused by Russia's financial problems.
</P>
<P>
   Goldin told a House Science Committee hearing that Russia was a
valuable partner in the space station program, but that the agency
shared the concerns of many members of Congress that the collapse
of the Russian economy threatened that nation's major contributions
to the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our reliance on Russian capabilities has to be reduced, not by
eliminating their involvement but by adding layers of protection,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The bailout money, $60 million of which is needed immediately,
is necessary to insure that the Russian-built service module, the
crucial third component of the modular space station, is completed
and ready for launching in July 1999, three months after an April
1999 date set earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Goldin said the $60 million was not a gift to Russia and would
buy the United States added storage space and research time on
Russian components of the station.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., who chairs the committee,
criticized the National Aeronautics and Space Administration for
making Russia a partner in the project and letting the troubled
nation have such a crucial role. Sensenbrenner said NASA had
assured Congress for years that it was taking steps to insure that
Russia would not be in such a critical position in the station
project that its problems would endanger completion of the station.
</P>
<P>
   ``The White House does not want to admit that its management of
our relationship with Russia is fundamentally flawed,''
Sensenbrenner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president promised me in writing in 1994 that we would not
be dependent on the Russians to build the international space
station,'' he continued, ``And now the administration wants to
stick the American taxpayer with the costs of its mistakes, just to
hide the fact that it made them.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tim Roemer, D-Ind., a longtime critic of the space station,
repeated his call to cancel the project. He noted that a recent
NASA audit estimated that each month's delay in the project cost
U.S. taxpayers at least $130 million, and predicted even more
delays because of Russia's money problems.
</P>
<P>
   Judyth Twigg, an expert in Russian affairs at Virginia
Commonwealth University in Richmond, Va., told the hearing that
Russia's problems run deeper than just a lack of money. Since the
breakup of the Soviet Union, Russia has not been conducting
meaningful research and development in space and its industrial
capacity has declined.
</P>
<P>
   White House science adviser Neal Lane said after the hearing
that Russia is experiencing more financial problems than anyone
anticipated when it became a partner in the space station program
four years ago. ``We want to work with them on the problems,'' he
said, adding that the administration was examining requests from
NASA for more money in future budgets to cover increased project
costs.
</P>
<P>
   Goldin said partners in the $40 billion space station project,
including the European Space Agency, Japan and Canada, agreed last
week to stay on schedule for launching the first two parts of the
station. Critics have questioned the wisdom of putting the first
two elements of the project into orbit this year and then having to
wait months for the much-delayed Russian service module.
</P>
<P>
   Russian Space Agency officials announced Wednesday that they
have started launching preparations for the first element, an
unmanned maneuver and storage unit named Zarya. The module, built
in Russia but paid for by the United States, is to be launched Nov.
20 on a Russian rocket. It is to be followed on Dec. 3 by the
launching of the space shuttle Endeavour carrying the first U.S.
element, a connecting module called Unity.
</P>
<P>
   James Oberg of Houston, an expert on the Russian space program,
told the hearing that too many doubts remain about the readiness of
the service module and other Russian-made components to launch the
first elements of the station.
</P>
<P>
   It would be a mistake, Oberg said, to begin launching elements
before re-evaluating options for the program, including one that
excludes Russian involvement.

MUSEUM DOCUMENTS BRAVES' BIGGEST SAVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Braves almost blew it. There was almost no Hank
Aaron Way in Atlanta, no bust outside Turner Field and no statue
commemorating his historic home run.
</P>
<P>
   They almost let him get away to the New York Giants, where he
would have been paired with Willie Mays in the greatest outfield
ever. Who cares who would have played left field.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves had an option on the services of a 17-year-old
shortstop from the Indianapolis Clowns of the Negro Leagues. But
Braves farm director John Mullen almost missed the deadline,
sending the historic telegram 10 minutes before their option
expired. Otherwise, the Giants would have obtained his rights.
</P>
<P>
   Papers uncovered in the Braves Museum last night before Game 1
of the National League Championship Series at Turner Field document
what happened 46 years ago ...
</P>
<P>
   Sometime in 1952, while the franchise was in Boston, Braves
scout Dewey Griggs wired the following message to Mullen:
</P>
<P>
   ``Indianapolis plays two games with Kansas City at Buffalo, and
at that time, I will give you a complete story on the boy. I am
satisfied with the boy's hitting. However I want to see him make
plays to both his right and left, and slow balls he has to come in
after. Also another look at his throwing ...''
</P>
<P>
   Griggs ended his message by saying, ``This boy could be the
answer.''
</P>
<P>
   On May 25, three days before the Braves option expired, Griggs
filed the following scouting report:
</P>
<P>
   ``The 17-year-old shortstop of the Indianapolis club looks very
good. In the first game, he had seven chances, two fly balls back
of third and five hard grounders ... started one double play ...
went 3-for-5 ... two line-drive singles and a perfect bunt. ... His
only error was a low throw from deep shortstop. ... In the second
game, he accepted five chances without an error ... started one
double play. Hit 3-for-4.''
</P>
<P>
   Mullen immediately telephoned Syd Pollock, general manager of
the Clowns, and received the following message on May 27:
</P>
<P>
   ``Re: our phone conversation, lowest deal I would consider on
our shortstop would be $10,000, with $2,500 down payment, the
balance to be paid after a 30-day look and a salary of $350 monthly
...
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel this youngster is another Ted Williams in the hitting
department and can hit to all fields, as well as lay down bunts,
and his fielding right now leaves little to be desired, outside a
little bit of polishing getting off his throws ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have looked into his draft status \Ra reference to the
Korean War\S and he is apt to be drafted by next spring, therefore
cannot guarantee delivery. But for his caliber of ballplayer and
his age, he is worth waiting two years for should he be called into
the service.''
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, with only 10 minutes left before the Braves'
option expired, Mullen sent the following telegram, written in the
finest legalese back to Pollock:
</P>
<P>
   ``This will acknowledge and accept the proposition contained in
our letter of May 27, 1952, and confirmed in our telephone
conversation of this date wherein you agree to release the contract
of the player, Henry Aaron, to the Evansville club of the Three I
League for the sum of $2,500 payable to the Indianapolis Clowns
upon the promulgation of the players contract by the National
Association of Professional Baseball Leagues and a further sum of
$7,500 payable to the Indianapolis Clowns if we retain the player
under contract 30 or more days after he reports to the club.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves retained him beyond 30 days and he was not drafted.
He did not have to fight in Korea. He played in Eau Claire (Wis.)
in 1952 and Jacksonville the following year. He joined the Braves
in 1954 and spent the next 21 years with them.
</P>
<P>
   The uniform he wore and the Louisville Slugger bat he used on
April 5, 1974, are in the Braves Museum, for it was on that night
he stepped to the plate and faced Dodgers pitcher Al Downing.
</P>
<P>
   The game was on national television and, in the fourth inning,
NBC's Curt Gowdy made the call:
</P>
<P>
   ``That ball is hit deep ... deep ... it's gone! He did it! He
did it! Hank Aaron, the all-time home run leader now.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark McGwire eclipsed Roger Maris' single-season record in 1998,
but a quarter-century later, Henry Aaron, the 17-year-old shortstop
from the Indianapolis Clowns who could bunt, who could be the
answer, who could be the next Ted Williams, stands alone.

IN WASHINGTON STATE POLL, MOST OPPOSE IMPEACHING CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY and MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ After months of allegations and revelations in the
Monica Lewinsky affair, only a third of Washington state voters
feel that Congress should impeach President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In a statewide poll of 810 Washington citizens, all
self-described regular voters, a combined total of 64 percent said
Congress should either censure Clinton or drop the investigation
entirely.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is we are not seeing an increase in the number
of people who would remove Clinton from office. ... These are
almost the same numbers I am getting in New York, Maryland and
Arkansas,'' said Del Ali, senior vice president of Mason-Dixon
Political/Media Research, which conducted the poll.
</P>
<P>
   But, added Portland-based pollster Tim Hibbitts after seeing the
figures, ``A third of the voters detest this man and would go for
burning at the stake if they could.''
</P>
<P>
   A solid if reduced majority, 54 percent, continued to give
Clinton good or excellent marks on his performance in office.
Another 21 percent gave the president fair marks, while 25 percent
rated his performance as poor. In a similar poll a month ago, which
asked the question differently, 65 percent said they approved of
Clinton's performance as president.
</P>
<P>
   Only 37 percent of the state's voters this time have a favorable
personal opinion of the president, a figure 5 percent lower than
Clinton's favorable rating in last month's poll, taken just before
special prosecutor Kenneth Starr's report was made public.
</P>
<P>
   The survey was conducted on Oct. 5 and 6 for the Seattle
Post-Intelligencer and KOMO-TV in Seattle. It had a margin of error
of plus or minus 3.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The poll's major findings include:
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)Resignation: Sixty percent of those surveyed said Clinton
should not resign, compared to 35 percent who said he should leave
office. The figures were similar to those in the September poll. In
that survey, taken on the eve of Starr's report, 33 percent favored
resignation while 62 percent were opposed.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)Punishment: Given three options, 33 percent of those
surveyed said Congress should immediately proceed to remove
President Clinton from office.
</P>
<P>
   Another 37 percent said that Clinton should be censured but
allowed to remain in office; 27 percent said the matter should be
dropped quickly.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)Congress and Starr: The survey showed Washington voters
evenly divided in the way that the Republican-controlled Congress
has handled issues related to possible impeachment: 45 percent
approved while 44 percent disapproved.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 44 percent said they approved of the way Starr has
handled the investigation of Clinton: 51 percent disapproved of
Starr's performance.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at the divisions, Ali commented: ``This whole
impeachment thing is now partisan, which is good for Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   The poll on Clinton's performance showed a yawning gender gap
among Washington voters. Women are opposed to resignation in
substantially greater numbers than men. And just 39 percent of
women approved of Starr's performance, while 55 percent
disapproved; 49 percent of men approved of Starr's handling of his
job and 47 percent disapproved.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 46 percent of men surveyed gave Clinton an
``excellent'' or ``good'' performance rating; 62 percent of women
gave the president high marks.
</P>
<P>
   ``On balance, women like his policies. It's not that they
approve of his behavior, but they feel on balance he has been a
decent president,'' Hibbitts said.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Aanes, 64, of Tacoma, part-owner of an electric sign
business, was one of those interviewed in the poll. ``I think he's
done a good job in his position as president,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She took a dim view of congressional Republicans who are
launching an impeachment investigation. ``They're blowing it
completely out of proportion to make a big stink in an election
year,'' she said. ``Nine out of any 10 of them have done the same
thing. They're just lucky enough not to get caught.''
</P>
<P>
   A contrasting view came from Charles Genther, 71, of Seattle,
who manages industrial property after retiring after a 37-year
career in the chemical business.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has continually obstructed justice,'' Genther said of
Clinton. ``He lied right to my face on television. If he doesn't
know the meaning of the word `is,' he shouldn't be in the White
House. ... My God, if I did that in court, I would be put in jail.
For the president to do it, again and again, the only thing is for
him to resign or, if he won't resign, to impeach him.''
</P>
<P>
   But opinions did not break down strictly by gender. Stephanie
Porcella, 52, a nurse from Bremerton, took a hard line on the
question of whether to drop the investigation, or settle for a
censure of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you drop it, you tell the whole country that it is okay to
lie under oath,'' Porcella said. ``I have four kids and I don't
want them raised that way. To sit there and censure him doesn't
deal with the problem. There is no option but to have the man
impeached.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Wilson, 74, a retired teacher from Edmonds, was more
sympathetic to the president, praising Clinton's performance in
office and arguing that Starr and the Republicans ``have just been
working until they could get something on him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They keep talking about being Christian but they will cast the
first stone no matter what,'' Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's defenders stressed his performance in office, and
criticized Congress for devoting its time and energy to impeachment
rather than other issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've wasted time chasing Clinton rather than taking care of
the budget and other issues. They haven't dealt with the business
at hand,'' said Terry Frost, 48, a mechanical designer from
Longview.
</P>
<P>
   Frost added that Clinton ``seens to work pretty good under
pressure'' and noted that the president has been under unrelenting
scrutiny since taking office in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 60 percent of those surveyed said their opinion of
Clinton will have no effect on their vote on congressional races
this November. But 15 percent said they will more likely vote
Democratic, and 25 percent said there is a greater likelihood they
will vote Republican.
</P>
<P>
   The gender gap prevailed once more. Only 7 percent of men

   Brett Bader, a leading Republican consultant, predicted that the
Clinton factor will be of ``marginal help'' to his party. ``It's a
mistake for Republicans to anticipate a big 1994-style anti-Clinton
backlash,'' he said. ``I do think in races that are tight, the edge
goes to the Republicans because of the scandal.''

U.S. DISCLOSES NEW CHARGES AGAINST MEXICAN INVOLVED IN DRUGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)

<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ U.S. officials announced Wednesday that drug and
money-laundering charges had been filed against Vicente Carrillo
Fuentes, the brother of a Mexican trafficker who died last year,
and they said Carrillo had assumed control of the drug-smuggling
cartel once led by his brother.
</P>
<P>
   But some U.S.n law-enforcement officials disputed the suggestion
that a 15-month struggle for control of the cartel has ended,
arguing that several violent factions continue to battle for
control.
</P>
<P>
   The cartel, which smuggles billions of dollars' worth of
cocaine, heroine and other drugs each year into Texas through
Juarez, across from El Paso, Texas, was led by Amado Carrillo
Fuentes until his death in July 1997 at age 41. Vicente Carrillo,
35, was one of several lieutenants.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1997, a federal grand jury in El Paso handed down a
27-count indictment against Vicente Carrillo on drug and
money-laundering charges, Bill Blagg, the United States attorney in
El Paso, disclosed Wednesday. The indictment had been sealed,
apparently to protect an investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Carrillo is believed to live in Mexico, where U.S. authorities
say his organization pays millions of dollars each month to Mexican
law-enforcement officials for protection. The main effect of the
announcement Wednesday appeared to be to increase pressure on
Mexican authorities to arrest Carrillo.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment charges Carrillo with smuggling more than four
tons of cocaine and nearly five tons of marijuana into West Texas
between 1985 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors leading the grand jury proceedings originally sought
charges against Amado Carrillo, Vicente Carrillo and Lino Herrera,
another lieutenant, a U.S. official said. But before the indictment
came down, Amado died of a medication overdose after plastic
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Within weeks, a succession struggle broke out, beginning when
gunmen firing at Herrera sprayed a popular Juarez restaurant with
bullets, killing Herrera and five bystanders.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican authorities said they believed the mastermind of that
attack was Rafael Munoz Talavera, another cartel leader seeking
control. Dozens of killings followed as factions led by Munoz,
Vicente Carrillo and perhaps others fought for control. Last month,
Munoz was found killed in Juarez.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States is seeking the man federal authorities
believe is now in control of the Juarez cartel,'' the Justice
Department said in a statement Wednesday. ``Authorities believe
that as a result of the deaths of Amado Carrillo Fuentes and Rafael
Munoz Talavera, Vicente Carrillo has assumed the leadership role of
the Juarez cartel.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bobby Castillo, the agent in charge of the Drug Enforcement
Administration's division in El Paso, said the struggle continues.
``I'd never say Vicente is the top dog now,'' he said. ``Vicente's
a major player, but there are other factions around.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexico was once dominated by a handful of well-defined cartels,
he said. When leaders died or were arrested, new chieftains quickly
seized control. In contrast, the drug underworld now appears to be
fragmenting into smuggling armies who work with scores of
sub-contractors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, there wasn't so much doubt about who is in charge,''
Castillo said. ``Now these organizations break into factions and
it's not so easy to identify leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington has requested Carrillo's extradition, but Mexican
judges have never ordered the extradition of a major trafficker.

RAYTHEON WIDENS LAYOFFS; LOWER EARNINGS FORESEEN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Wash., S.C., Mass., Calif.)   (bl)

<P>
   Continuing to struggle in its construction operation and in its
attempts to build a lean, integrated military electronics business,
Raytheon Co. said Wednesday that it would expand layoffs and would
not meet Wall Street's expectations for third-quarter earnings.
</P>
<P>
   The company had said earlier this year that it would shed about
8,700 jobs by the end of 1999. Wednesday, it raised that figure to
about 14,000 jobs, or roughly 16 percent of its work force.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon spent almost $13 billion last year to acquire the
military units of Hughes Electronics and Texas Instruments, and the
company has been trying to squeeze costs from the combined
operation ever since.
</P>
<P>
   As the jobs disappear, Raytheon, the No. 3 military contractor,
intends to close operations in Texas, Washington, South Carolina,
Massachusetts and California.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon also said that its beleaguered engineering and
construction business, which some analysts have urged the company
to sell, had dragged down earnings for the third quarter. Analysts
had predicted that the company would earn 90 cents a share, but in
a statement Raytheon said its earnings would be ``slightly below''
that figure.
</P>
<P>
   In the statement, the company also said the weakness in the
construction operation would lead it to take an after-tax charge of
$284 million, or 83 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news is they are facing the problems square on and
they are going to get rid of them,'' said Howard Rubel, who follows
Raytheon for Goldman, Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to scheduled meetings Thursday between analysts and
Raytheon's top management, he added, ``The bad news is the earnings
are a little bit light and the valuation is probably based on
earnings, so the run-up in the shares on expectations of some very
good strategic direction tomorrow will probably be over for a short
while.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's announcement was a coming out of sorts for Daniel
Burnham, Raytheon's president and chief operating officer. He
joined the company 100 days ago after serving as vice chairman of
Allied Signal Inc. His conference call Wednesday with reporters was
his first since joining Raytheon. He is to take over as chief
executive in December from Dennis Picard.

JUDGE OVERTURNS MAYOR'S EFFORT TO BLOCK STADIUM REFERENDUM 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DAN BARRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On a day when he had hoped to revel in the playoff
exploits of the Yankees, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani was instead rebuked
Wednesday by a state judge, who ruled that the mayor's maneuvers to
block a referendum on the future of Yankee Stadium were improper,
and said the issue should go to the voters next month.
</P>
<P>
   Describing the stadium as a ``tabernacle of sport,'' Justice
Douglas McKeon of state Supreme Court in the Bronx rejected
Giuliani's efforts to prevent the binding referendum, which would
ask voters whether city tax dollars should be spent to help build a
new stadium for the Yankees on the West Side of Manhattan. The
mayor and the team's principal owner, George Steinbrenner III, have
endorsed such a plan, but many city leaders oppose it, including
the city council speaker, Peter Vallone, who proposed the
referendum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yankee Stadium is uniquely a public property,'' the judge
wrote. ``And its destiny should be decided by the public.''
</P>
<P>
   City lawyers immediately appealed to the Appellate Division of
state Supreme Court, which granted a stay late Wednesday afternoon.
No new court date has been set, but the matter requires a fast
resolution: the city's Board of Elections plans to print its
absentee ballots for the November election as early as the end of
this week.
</P>
<P>
   McKeon questioned the mayor's creation of a charter revision
commission last spring as a shrewd but troubling tactic intended
solely to thwart the Yankee Stadium referendum. The Giuliani
administration had maintained that, by law, any ballot proposal
from a charter commission would prevent a referendum on another
issue from appearing on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   But McKeon ruled that the commission, which the mayor packed
with friends and allies, had improperly rushed through its mandate
to review the entire city Charter, only to come up with one
proposal, to change a piece of the city's campaign finance law. The
judge declared the commission's ballot proposal to be null and
void, effectively creating ballot space for the stadium referendum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether the commission embarked on its work with good
intentions will never be known,'' McKeon wrote. ``Simply said, the
urgency to find a proposal to blockade the council's Yankee Stadium
proposal rendered the work of the commission in 1998 a virtual
charade.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly exercised by the 15-page decision, Giuliani denounced
McKeon as a tool of the Bronx Democratic Party machine, and
dismissed his ruling as being devoid of objective legal analysis.
In particular, he said, the judge was wrong in maintaining that the
commission was required to do a thorough review of the entire
Charter.
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether he was also playing politics when he first
appointed the Charter Revision Commission, the mayor said: ``You're
darn right I was. I'm the mayor _ I'm entitled to play politics.
But judges are not supposed to do that.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Vallone, who is the Democratic candidate for governor, hailed
the judge's ruling. ``This is a victory for the people,'' he told
reporters at Buffalo International Airport. ``It confirms what I've
always said: that the mayor's commission was a sham.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel DeFrancesco, executive director of the Board of
Elections, said it planned to begin printing absentee ballots that
include the stadium referendum by the end of the week unless the
appeals court intervenes.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic speaker and the Republican mayor have been
quarreling for most of 1998, primarily because they disagree on how
best to handle the question of how to keep Steinbrenner from
following through on his periodic threats to leave Yankee Stadium,
which he considers to be inadequate and unsafe, once the team's
lease ends in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   When Giuliani proposed that the city help to build a stadium in
Manhattan, Vallone countered with his proposed referendum. The
council speaker's move infuriated the mayor on two levels: it
stymied his ability to negotiate with the team, he said, and was
intended purely to increase voter turnout for Vallone's
gubernatorial bid.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani responded with his Charter Commission, which
immediately laid out an ambitious agenda aimed at coming up with
some proposal to amend the Charter that would knock off Vallone's
referendum. After contentious public hearings at which its very
purpose was ridiculed, the commission announced in August that it
was recommending a ballot proposal to prohibit candidates from
accepting campaign contributions from corporations.
</P>
<P>
   The council quickly sent Giuliani a message that their fight _
one that has also spilled into the city's budget process _ was far
from over. In addition to overriding the mayor's veto of its
stadium referendum and passing a campaign finance package of its
own, the council filed a lawsuit in the Bronx that charged, among
other allegations, that that mayor had convened the commission for
improper reasons.
</P>
<P>
   In his decision, McKeon addressed only briefly whether a
mayor-sponsored Charter question legally bumps any referendum from
the ballot, which the city's lawyers contend is the crux of the
matter. Instead, he focused on the Charter Commission's ``slapdash
approach'' to its responsibilities, and its vow to reconvene next
year to examine the matters it had set aside because of its
self-imposed time constraints.
</P>
<P>
   McKeon concluded his decision with a brief celebration of the
75-year-old Bronx stadium, describing it as the home to ``magical
memories,'' like the Louis-Schmeling fight of 1938 _ and a ``legacy
that has been passed down to generations of New Yorkers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our mayor is able, hands on, and our city has benefited from
his stewardship,'' the judge wrote. ``However, in the unique
circumstance where a city is asked to construct a stadium to serve
the generations of New Yorkers to come, a limitation on the powers
of elected officials to make that decision is not offensive to any
constitutional, statutory or common law pronouncement.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter how eloquent the judge's ruling may have been, Michael
Hess, the city's corporation counsel, found it to be ``politically
motivated'' and wanting in legal analysis. ``Governments and cities
are not run by popular votes on every subject,'' Hess said.
``There's a proper procedure to have matters put on the ballot, and
the judge has not followed that proper procedure.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani was not as restrained in his assessment. ``The legal
analysis and legal scholarship is nonexistent,'' he said, during an
early-afternoon news conference in Manhattan. ``I think essentially
we did appear before the Democratic County Committee of the
Bronx.''

CARVILLE WON'T BE SILENCED AND CRITICIZES DEMOCRATS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A week after the White House and congressional
Democrats disavowed his ``war'' on Speaker Newt Gingrich, James
Carville, President Clinton's former campaign strategist and chief
outside defender, put forth a new battle cry Wednesday: He will not
be muzzled.
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, but Carville went beyond his customary
denunciations of Gingrich and the Republicans and, in an interview,
trained his fire on leaders in his own party for not being
sufficiently aggressive four weeks before Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sense of frustration is that I believe the Democrats have a
much better chance of doing much better than anyone expects,''
Carville said. ``And I don't think anyone's emerging to try to pull
it together. Everybody ought to be pushing, the leadership in the
Congress, the White House, the DNC. We ought to hammer Gingrich
every day. How can you take the Congress back if you don't make a
case against the people who are running it? I have never heard of a
strategy like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounding increasingly agitated, he went on: ``The only people
left to be activated in this election are Democrats. The right
wing, they're bouncing off the walls. They're going out to vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dick Gephardt, the minority leader, complained to Erskine
Bowles, the White House chief of staff, after Carville appeared on
the NBC News program ``Meet the Press'' on Sept. 27 and declared,
``Cpl. Cue Ball Carville will be rolling into battle against Newt
Gingrich.''
</P>
<P>
   The concern among House Democrats, one expressed by some White
House officials as well, was that Carville's vitriol would make the
Democrats appear overly partisan and could be especially damaging
to Democrats in marginal districts who do not want to appear too
easy on the president.
</P>
<P>
   But on Wednesday, Carville was anything but timid. ``If Gephardt
people think they've quieted me down,'' he said, ``I'm not
quieted.'' Carville said he told officials at the White House,
``Don't waste your breath about calling me and telling me not to
say this.''
</P>
<P>
   Carville insisted that he would rather do battle with
Republicans than with his fellow Democrats. ``If they want to fight
with me, they can,'' he said. ``I'm going to fight with the
Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet he could not help but ridicule his party. Asked to describe
the Democrats' strategy for the election, Carville said, ``If there
is one, no one's shared it with me.''

SEN. PATTY MURRAY HAS COMFORTABLE LEAD IN RE-ELECTION BID

   WASHINGTON _ In a year when Democrats in general and female
senators in particular are running scared, Sen. Patty Murray,
D-Wash., is comfortably ahead of her re-election challenger, Rep.
Linda Smith, R-Wash., according to a statewide Seattle
Post-Intelligencer/KOMO News 4 poll.
</P>
<P>
   The poll, conducted Monday and Tuesday, found 51 percent of
likely voters plan to support Murray on Nov. 3, while 38 percent
plan to support Smith.
</P>
<P>
   The poll found Murray, a Seattle resident first elected in 1992,
running strongly ahead of Smith among women and in the central
Puget Sound region. Smith, elected to the House in 1994, leads only
in her home base of southwest Washington and in Republican-leaning
central Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an nutshell, this is Patty Murray's race to lose, and I
would be shocked if she lost the race,'' said pollster Del Ali.
``Murray would have to self-destruct ... she would have to say
something or do something absolutely stupid for her to lose this.''
</P>
<P>
   The poll was conducted by Mason-Dixon Political/Media Research
Inc., which interviewed 810 likely voters from around the state.
The poll has a margin of error of 3.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The poll's findings contrast Murray's situation with that of the
two other female senators elected in 1992, the so-called Year of
the Woman. Sen. Carol Mosely-Braun, D-Ill., is widely expected to
lose her re-election bid, while Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., is
running neck-and-neck with her challenger.
</P>
<P>
   Murray said she is pleased by the poll results, which echoed the
findings of her own pollster.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of momentum going, and the campaign is really
moving,'' she said. ``We now have 40,000 individual contributors,
which is really heart-warming, and the issues I'm talking about _
education, the environment and safe communities _ are issues people
care about.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith's campaign professed not to be concerned by the poll
findings, and both campaigns acknowledge that the race will likely
tighten in coming weeks. Smith's position against Murray in polls
has strengthened slightly over time, and polls have often
underestimated Smith's strength among voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just a snapshot in time, taken when nobody has really
examined Patty Murray's record,'' said Smith spokesman Jim Troyer.
``When people find out about Linda and her record, they are very
excited about her.''
</P>
<P>
   The Smith campaign is counting on two major factors to change
the dynamic of the race in the remaining four weeks: television ads
and debates.
</P>
<P>
   Smith went on the air this week with television ads for the
first time since the Sept. 15 primary. Murray, who has a
significantly larger campaign warchest than Smith, has been on the
air non-stop since mid-August.
</P>
<P>
   All of the advertising to date has been positive, although Smith
has been testing in focus groups an ad that criticizes Murray as
ineffective. Smith's current ad talks about Social Security, while
Murray's current ads talk about her general accomplishments as well
as her fight against Internet pornography.
</P>
<P>
   But negative ads could be a mixed blessing for Smith; the poll
found that since the primary, voters have come to view Murray less
favorably, but they also have come to view Smith less favorably.
Murray is now viewed favorably by 48 percent of voters and
unfavorably by 30 percent, while Smith is viewed favorably by 38
percent and unfavorably by 28 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The two have tentatively agreed to face off at one debate, on
Oct. 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would expect the Senate race to be closer than the poll
indicates,'' said GOP consultant Brett Bader, who said undecided
voters are likely to break Smith's way. ``I expect the race will
narrow. It's unlikely undecided voters will go to the incumbent.''
</P>
<P>
   The poll found that Murray has a 56 to 33 percent lead among
women, but only a 46 to 43 percent lead among men.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why women favor her campaign, Murray said, ``I say what
they would say if they had the opportunity to be here. Like me,
they are taking care of kids and parents, and they know I bring
those issues to the table.''
</P>
<P>
   Pollster Ali said that on some issues of importance to women _
education, crime and abortion rights _ Murray is stronger than
Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Among overall voters, a candidate's character is the most
important issue in this election, followed by education, taxation,
the economy and health care, according to the poll. But among women
the top issue is education, an issue that Murray talks about
constantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the last few weeks of this race are about school vouchers,
abortion or guns, Smith's going to get her butt handed to her,''
Ali said. ``Smith needs to go after Murray and ask what Patty
Murray has brought to the state.''
</P>
<P>
   The poll found Murray with a huge lead among voters in the
central Puget Sound area (King, Snohomish, Kitsap and Pierce
counties), where she leads Smith 59 percent to 33 percent; an 11
percent lead in northwest Washington, and a 4 percent lead in
eastern Washington. Smith leads Murray by 9 percent in southwest
Washington, the area she represents in Congress, and by six percent
in central Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Smith will need to look for more women like Sue-Ann Mickelson, a
35-year-old bookkeeper from Battle Ground, who said, ``In the
beginning, I could see Patty Murray was a mom, and I thought she
was for some good things, but to me, she's gone way too liberal,
and supports a lot of liberal money-spending issues I do not agree
with.''
</P>
<P>
   But Murray can take heart from women like Barbara Wilson, a
74-year-old retired teacher from Edmonds, who said of Smith ``she's
just like most of the Christian Coalition people. She's too
dogmatic, too concerned about herself and her own career rather
than the needs of others.'' Of Murray, Wilson said, ``She's really
been trying to fight for a number of things helpful to us. One is
on abortion, the right for women to have a choice.''

SPORTS COLUMN: BRAVES NEED YANKEES TO AFFIRM GREATNESS

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Tony Gwynn stood outside a batting cage discussing the
story line of this National League championship series between his
San Diego Padres and the Atlanta Braves The story line is pitching:
In John Smoltz, Tom Glavine and Greg Maddux, Atlanta has one of the
greatest rotations of all time.
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn spoke bravely, wisely and realistically about what San
Diego needed to do during the coming days to win the series. No, he
would not be intimidated, nor would his team. Coming into this
series, 302 of his 2,928 hits have come against Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``We faced them 50, 60, 70 times, so you're not in awe,'' he
said of the Atlanta starters. ``I got about 60 at-bats, 70 at-bats
off all of them. You can't come into a series like this expecting
to just shock the world. I can't come in here thinking I'm going to
hit four or five home runs. I got to take what they give me and try
to do something with it. They don't give you anything.''
</P>
<P>
   This playoffs series is a tale of two diametrically opposed
franchises, contemporary baseball in a microcosm. Small-market San
Diego reached the World Series for the first and only time in
franchise history in 1984. Atlanta, a larger market, has been the
National League's dominant team of the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn was a 24-year-old rookie in 1984, completing his first
full season in the majors. He batted .351 and led San Diego to a
pennant and the World Series, where the Padres lost to Detroit.
Gywnn said that if someone had told him then that the Padres
wouldn't come close to another Series for 14 seasons, he might not
have stayed in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt that we'd find a way to get back in three or four
years,'' he said. Now at 38, Gwynn is heavier, injured, and the end
of a career is closing in. The time to win is now. ``With four free
agents and a $50 million payroll,'' he said, ``the writing is on
the wall. There is a sense of urgency.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is also a sense of urgency for Atlanta; this sense of
mission has nothing to do with the opponent at hand, nothing really
do to with the National League. This time Atlanta is not merely
dueling for a spot in the World Series. This time, it is competing
for a place in history.
</P>
<P>
   If Atlanta's final history were written this instant, it would
go down as a great organization with outstanding efficiency and a
great pitching staff. Atlanta reached the National League
Championship Series in 1969, 1982, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1995, 1996 and
1997. Atlanta reached the World Series in 1991 and lost to
Minnesota; in 1992 and lost to Toronto; in 1995 and defeated
Cleveland and in 1996 when it lost to New York.
</P>
<P>
   For Atlanta to be regarded as one of the great teams of this
century there is one more level to reach. But what makes this so
tricky is that it depends on more than reaching the World Series
and winning it. A victory over Cleveland will not catapult the
Braves into exalted history; they've beaten Cleveland. Atlanta
needs the Yankees. They need to be affirmed by a team that's being
regarded as one of the best of all time.
</P>
<P>
   Two seasons ago, Atlanta took a commanding 2-0 lead over New
York; the Yankees won the Series, 4 games to 2. Fulton-County
Stadium is demolished now, but reminders of New York are all over
the postseason landscape: There's Jim Leyritz, who joined the
Padres in June. Leyritz's three-run home in the eighth inning of
Game 4 of the 1996 Series tied the game and led to an 8-6 Yankees
victory. Nothing Smoltz, Maddux and Glavine will do this week can
change that history.
</P>
<P>
   Someone kidded Leyritz that his home run helped demolish
Fulton-County Stadium. ``Game 5 demolished it,'' he quipped,
referring to the Yankees 1-0 victory in what was the last game in
that stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Leyritz's cap, with No. 39 printed on the side in
honor of his former Yankees teammate Darryl Strawberry. The
crushing loss to New York in '96, last year's unexpected loss to
Florida in the championship series, one World Series victory in
four attempts: It's an incomplete legacy.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the early '90s when Atlanta's bloom was fresh, we were
thrilled by Deion Sanders shuttling between pro football and
baseball in Atlanta. The Braves were a scrappy, hungry team that
excited the imagination, satisfied the hunger for something new.
Sanders was organic, visceral, the Braves were soulful.
</P>
<P>
   Today, pitcher-driven Atlanta has never recaptured that same
scrappy edge and gritty temperament. The team is efficient and
academic, reliant on Rolls Royce pitching, booming home runs from
assorted, rotating free agents. ``I think this business-type
attitude hasn't gotten the job done,'' said Atlanta's Chipper
Jones. Said Leyritz: ``You have to have that extra emotion this
time of year. Maybe that extra edge is what's missing with them
sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   The franchise wants to wash away the bitter taste of 1996, to
establish itself as one of the great teams of all time. To do so,
it must defeat one of the great teams of all time. Atlanta needs
the Yankees like Muhammad Ali needed a menacing Sonny Liston, the
way the Joe Namath-led Jets needed the Baltimore Colts.
</P>
<P>
   In what may be baseball's last great season of the century,
Atlanta's door to greatness, its road to posterity, goes through
Yankees Stadium.

ANALYSIS: CONGRESS LEAVES PROMISES LARGELY UNFULFILLED 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Last spring, Speaker Newt Gingrich and other
Republican leaders in the House promised representatives from the
Christian Coalition that Congress would end what the conservatives
call partial-birth abortion, eliminate financing for the National
Endowment for the Arts and work for a constitutional amendment to
permit prayer in public schools.
</P>
<P>
   So much for promises. Not one of the measures was adopted.
Neither was much else of consequence this year in one of the least
productive sessions of Congress in memory.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since formal congressional budget procedures
were established in 1974, Congress did not even adopt a budget for
the current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   The big tax cut, including tax relief for married couples, which
Republicans once hoped would be the cornerstone of their fall
election campaigns, fell by the wayside. So did fast-track trade
legislation, vouchers for children to attend private schools, and
almost all the other main items on the Republican agenda at the
beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation to overhaul the IRS and expand the rights of
taxpayers was enacted, probably the most important new law of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   Congress made progress Wednesday on a bill to tighten bankruptcy
rules, and several other modest measures could make it through the
mill in the rush to recess.
</P>
<P>
   But a seismic Republican idea _ a bill to abolish the income tax
altogether at the end of 2002 to force enactment of a new method of
taxation _ died in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats did not fare any better. Their big-ticket items like
an increase in the minimum wage and a return to the old system of
federal subsidies for farmers never got off the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The most ambitious measures of the year _ tobacco regulation,
restrictions on managed-care health plans and changes in the
campaign finance laws _ began as Democratic initiatives but gained
a fair amount of bipartisan support. No matter. They went nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   So what happened? Normally the second session of each Congress
is quite active. It is an election year when lawmakers are usually
eager to put their stamp on legislation. Why was 1998 such a bust
on Capitol Hill?
</P>
<P>
   The main answer seems to be that the public likes it this way.
The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll showed that the proportion
of people who approve of the way Congress is handling its job fell
somewhat last month after the House Judiciary Committee published
the impeachment report of Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr. But
Congress' approval rating was still around 50 percent, where it has
hovered all year _ the highest percentage in a quarter of a
century.
</P>
<P>
   Contrast this with last year. In 1997, Congress approved the
first balanced budget since the 1960s, the first tax cut since 1981
and vast changes to shore up the Medicare system. It also passed _
no small feat _ all 13 spending bills to finance government
departments and agencies. At the end of the year, only 33 percent
of the people said they approved of the way Congress was working.
</P>
<P>
   The same low percentage approved of Congress at the end of 1996,
an enormously productive legislative year given that Congress and
the White House were controlled by different parties. This was the
year of welfare reform, several new environmental laws, a rewriting
of all agriculture support programs, an increase in the minimum
wage, new rules for the telecommunications industry and a bill
guaranteeing that workers could keep their medical insurance when
they changed jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are other reasons for the congressional
inertia:
</P>
<P>
   _ President Clinton was so disabled by scandal that he had no
strength left to wrestle with Congress over legislation that was
especially important to him.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Republican leadership in the Senate used the filibuster, a
tool normally reserved to protect the rights of the minority, to
block campaign finance and tobacco legislation.
</P>
<P>
   _ The difference in philosophy between Republicans in the House,
dominated by social conservatives, and those in the Senate, whose
strongest alliance is with business interests, became so wide that
accommodation, beyond renaming Washington National Airport after
Ronald Reagan, was often impossible.
</P>
<P>
   _ The productive sessions in 1996 and 1997, in the words of L.
Ari Fleischer, spokesman for the House Ways and Means Committee,
``used up all the oxygen in the room,'' leaving little for this
year that Congress and the president could agree on.
</P>
<P>
   But in the final analysis, Democrats and Republicans seemed more
interested in campaign issues than in legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are basing their campaign this year on the theme of
the ``do-nothing Republican Congress,'' hoping against hope that
this will compete in voters' minds with the scandal in the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans concede that they have been warned by their
pollsters and consultants they play to Democrats' strength when
they concentrate on issues like prayer in schools and restrictions
on abortions and emphasize tax cuts over Social Security. Those
issues may play well in conservative states and districts that
Republicans can win anyway. But they could cause the party to lose
the swing votes they need if they are to gain seats in the November
election.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we will be back next year with an even larger majority
in both the House and the Senate,'' House Majority Leader Dick
Armey told reporters this week. ``And those things that perhaps we
don't get done this year, we can get done next year.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House and Senate Republicans agreed Wednesday on a
vast overhaul of the bankruptcy system, making it more difficult
for consumers to walk away from their debts and handing the banking
and credit-card industries a major victory.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement was reached without the consent of congressional
Democrats or the White House, and administration officials said
they would recommend that President Clinton veto the bill because
of its treatment of low-income consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Republican agreement, only consumers with relatively
low incomes could declare bankruptcy under the rules that wipe out
many debts. But the agreement would give bankruptcy judges some
discretion in determining whether debtors could file under Chapter
7, which wipes out many debts, or under Chapter 13, which requires
the repayment of most debts.
</P>
<P>
   Debtors who earn more than the median income _ $17,900 for
single people and $51,000 for a family of four _ would be moved
into Chapter 13. Also sent into Chapter 13 would be debtors who
could repay 25 percent of their unsecured debts, like credit cards,
or $5,000 over five years.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiated bill weakens a Senate-passed requirement that
credit card companies disclose on each monthly bill how much
consumers will owe and for how long if they make only the minimum
payment.
</P>
<P>
   It also drops a Senate provision that sets a $100,000 limit on
the value of homes that could be kept by those declaring
bankruptcy. This means that people could still move to certain
states, like Florida and Texas, buy expensive homes, declare
bankruptcy and keep the entire worth of their homes. However, the
compromise bill requires these people to live in the adopted state
for at least two years before they can claim the homestead
exemption.
</P>
<P>
   With the perception that low-income Americans _ primarily women
and minorities, who are among Clinton's most reliable political
allies _ would be hurt most by the bill, Hillary Rodham Clinton has
argued against the House version, toward which the compromise
tilts.
</P>
<P>
   The industry supported the House-passed bill, which was guided
by a concern that filing for bankruptcy had become too easy and
that thousands of Americans were abusing the system. The Senate
bill started from the premise that easily available credit is also
responsible for the increase in bankruptcies and that the
credit-card industry needed to be held accountable along with
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Both the House and Senate had earlier approved vastly different
bills, and negotiators have been scrambling to iron out the
differences before Congress recesses this weekend. The Republican
agreement was sent to the House floor for a vote, which could come
as early as Thursday
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said Wednesday that they were happy with the
compromise and that it was fair, but Democrats were furious, none
more so than Sen. Richard Durbin of Illinois. He had joined
Republicans in seeking an overhaul of the bankruptcy system, and
his name gave the process bipartisan credibility. But he said he
was shut out of the final negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill, which had passed by a vote of 97-1, ``has been
devastated in a closed-door Republican conference,'' Durbin said.
``Republican conferees stripped out every significant consumer
protection in the Senate bill,'' he added. ``The president will not
sign this bill in its present form.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's agreement represents a huge success for banks,
credit-card companies and retailers. The lending industry spent
more than $40 million to lobby for the changes, which could help it
recoup an estimated $4 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   Bankruptcy filings reached a record 1.42 million over the 12
months ending on June 30, continuing a troubling three-year trend
that has persisted despite the robust economy. More than 1 million
of these bankruptcies were filed under Chapter 7, which erases all
debt except taxes, mortgages, student loans, child support, alimony
and, in some cases, loans on a car needed to get to work.
</P>
<P>
   The industry supported the House-passed bill, which was guided
by a concern that filing for bankruptcy had become too easy and
that thousands of Americans were abusing the system. The Senate
bill started from the premise that easily available credit is also
responsible for the increase in bankruptcies and that the
credit-card industry needed to be held accountable along with
consumers.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, who led the negotiations for the
Senate, said that the compromise protected honest consumers from
those who abused the bankruptcy rules. ``Consumers across the
country who work hard and pay their own way should not be forced to
subsidize the abusive spending practices of those who exploit the
federal bankruptcy code for personal gain or convenience,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   William Binzel, a lobbyist for MasterCard International, said
that complaints of a bill that let the industry off the hook were
unfounded. ``If a lender makes credit available to someone who
can't afford to repay it, the lender loses the principle and
interest,'' he said. ``The bill addresses the fundamental flaw in
the law that allows a debtor who can repay a portion of his debts
to use the system to walk away from those debts.''

compromise bill requires these people to live in the adopted state
for at least two years before they can claim the homestead
exemption.
</P>
<P>
   With the perception that low-income Americans _ primarily women
and minorities, who are among Clinton's most reliable political
allies _ would be hurt most by the bill, Hillary Rodham Clinton has
argued against the House version, toward which the compromise
tilts.
</P>
<P>
   The industry supported the House-passed bill, which was guided
by a concern that filing for bankruptcy had become too easy and
that thousands of Americans were abusing the system. The Senate
bill started from the premise that easily available credit is also
responsible for the increase in bankruptcies and that the
credit-card industry needed to be held accountable along with
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Both the House and Senate had earlier approved vastly different
bills, and negotiators have been scrambling to iron out the
differences before Congress recesses this weekend. The Republican
agreement was sent to the House floor for a vote, which could come
as early as Thursday
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said Wednesday that they were happy with the
compromise and that it was fair, but Democrats were furious, none
more so than Sen. Richard Durbin of Illinois. He had joined
Republicans in seeking an overhaul of the bankruptcy system, and
his name gave the process bipartisan credibility. But he said he
was shut out of the final negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill, which had passed by a vote of 97-1, ``has been
devastated in a closed-door Republican conference,'' Durbin said.
``Republican conferees stripped out every significant consumer
protection in the Senate bill,'' he added. ``The president will not
sign this bill in its present form.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's agreement represents a huge success for banks,
credit-card companies and retailers. The lending industry spent
more than $40 million to lobby for the changes, which could help it
recoup an estimated $4 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   Bankruptcy filings reached a record 1.42 million over the 12
months ending on June 30, continuing a troubling three-year trend
that has persisted despite the robust economy. More than 1 million
of these bankruptcies were filed under Chapter 7, which erases all
debt except taxes, mortgages, student loans, child support, alimony
and, in some cases, loans on a car needed to get to work.
</P>
<P>
   The industry supported the House-passed bill, which was guided
by a concern that filing for bankruptcy had become too easy and
that thousands of Americans were abusing the system. The Senate
bill started from the premise that easily available credit is also
responsible for the increase in bankruptcies and that the
credit-card industry needed to be held accountable along with
consumers.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, who led the negotiations for the
Senate, said that the compromise protected honest consumers from
those who abused the bankruptcy rules. ``Consumers across the
country who work hard and pay their own way should not be forced to
subsidize the abusive spending practices of those who exploit the
federal bankruptcy code for personal gain or convenience,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   William Binzel, a lobbyist for MasterCard International, said
that complaints of a bill that let the industry off the hook were
unfounded. ``If a lender makes credit available to someone who
can't afford to repay it, the lender loses the principle and
interest,'' he said. ``The bill addresses the fundamental flaw in
the law that allows a debtor who can repay a portion of his debts
to use the system to walk away from those debts.''

GOP DARLING ROGAN FACES BATTLE AT HOME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE CONDON  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In his freshman term in Congress, Rep. Jim Rogan,
a Republican representing nearby Pasadena, has made quite a splash
in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Embraced by the Republican leadership, he is viewed in the
nation's capital as a man with a bright future and recently made
cable TV news channel MSNBC's list of the top 10 political stars of
the new century.
</P>
<P>
   House leaders waived their rules so Rogan could serve on two
high-profile committees _ Commerce and Judiciary, the latter now
weighing the fate of President Clinton. His role on the Judiciary
Committee has made him a regular source for the capital press corps
and landed him on ABC's ``This Week,'' a Sunday morning political
talk show, twice in the past month.
</P>
<P>
   But back home in the L.A.-area voting precincts of Burbank,
Glendale, Pasadena and Sunland, the GOP's rising star is running
for re-election in a district where 44 percent of the voters are
Democrats and only 39 percent are Republican.
</P>
<P>
   His Democratic opponent, former Screen Actors Guild President
Barry Gordon, is running an aggressive, well-funded campaign and is
trying to convince voters there are two Jim Rogans _ an
archconservative who plays to the GOP leadership in Washington and
an easygoing moderate who is presented to voters back home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once people understand his voting record, they run away from
him,'' said Gordon, a lawyer and actor. ``This is not the Jim Rogan
people see here, but it is the Jim Rogan who is representing them
in Washington. He's certainly in Newt Gingrich's inner circle, and
he's been there since he got there.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides Rogan and Gordon, the 27th District race includes
Glendale businessman Bob New, who is running as a Libertarian.
</P>
<P>
   Rogan dismissed Gordon's strategy, saying it is an example of
Democrats' ``cookie cutter'' campaigns that try to portray
Republicans as rabid right-wingers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They morph all the Republicans into one group. Anybody who
happens to be pro-life is an extremist,'' Rogan said. ``I don't
need to defend myself against this kind of silliness. (Gordon)
desperately wants to run against Newt Gingrich.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogan's political rise, as a former Glendale Municipal Court
judge and state assemblyman, reflects his success as a vote-getter
in the region. He downplays his new higher profile in Washington,
saying he has turned down most of the interview requests he
received.
</P>
<P>
   But while the 27th Congressional District once was considered
solid GOP turf, voter registration has swung to the Democrats in
recent years, and the Democratic Party has labeled it a target of
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Until two years ago, Republicans held all the local seats for
state and federal elected legislative seats. But in 1996, for the
first time in decades, local Democrats won the seats in both the
state Senate and Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now Rogan is only Republican in town,'' said Alan Hoffenblum,
a veteran GOP political consultant who also publishes a bipartisan
subscription service analyzing key political races. ``He's in a
district that is very volatile.''
</P>
<P>
   While Hoffenblum expects Rogan will win, he said Rogan will have
to campaign to keep the seat and take nothing for granted _
regardless of whether folks in Washington see him as the next big
thing.
</P>
<P>
   Rogan said he is proud of the work he has done in Congress since
1996. ``We've balanced the budget and given America a surplus
economy,'' he said, adding that he has his eye on HMO reform and
establishment of a Social Security trust fund.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon said the race will be decided by swing voters who may be
in the dark about their congressman's record.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon said Rogan has voted against gun-control laws, is an
abortion foe, has accepted $18,000 from tobacco companies during
his various campaigns for public office, and has voted in favor of
bills to weaken state and federal anti-pollution laws, college
financial aid, the Head Start program and programs supporting
low-income school districts.
</P>
<P>
   Rogan countered that Gordon is trying to paint him as being
anti-education and anti-environment because he didn't support
Democratic budget proposals that called for large increases in
spending that would have made it impossible to balance the budget.
The Republican budget held the line on spending while providing the
appropriate funding for programs, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon's campaign notes that the National Journal's annual
rankings of members of Congress reported that Rogan was more
conservative than 90percent of his House colleagues on social
issues, 88 percent of them on foreign issues and 73percent on
economic issues.
</P>
<P>
   Rogan said he may be conservative, but he does not follow his
party in lock step, noting that The Wall Street Journal recently
referred to him as a ``reasonable Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a fool,'' he added. ``I have to be reasonable and work
with both sides. It's the most practical way of getting the job
done.''
</P>
<P>
   Olivia Morgan, a spokeswoman for the Democratic Congressional
Campaign Committee, said Rogan's membership on the committee
evaluating possible impeachment could be a liability.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rogan is in a precarious position, being on the Judiciary
Committee and simultaneously representing a district that has
supported Clinton,'' Morgan said.
</P>
<P>
   But Ron Reese, a spokesman for the National Republican
Congressional Committee, said the Democrats can't beat Rogan.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no chance Jim Rogan is going to get beat in
November,'' Reese said. ``The Democrats are certainly overstating
their chances.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon also has criticized Rogan for not paying enough attention
to the battle over Burbank Airport expansion, which Burbank
officials and residents oppose out of their belief that it would
bring more noise and traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, Gordon said Rogan should have been in Burbank for
Federal Aviation Administration boss Jane Garvey's visit last
month.
</P>
<P>
   Rogan sent a letter to Garvey asking her to be sensitive to
Burbank's concerns. He said last week that he is willing to offer
any assistance he can, but ultimately it is up to local officials
to work out their problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone wants either Sacramento or Washington to mandate a
solution,'' Rogan said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the dispute itself, Rogan said he is sympathetic to
Burbank residents and their complaints about noise, and that
Glendale and Pasadena officials should take those concerns
seriously.

INJURED MITCHELL HAS SUPPORT SYSTEM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Freddie Mitchell awoke from surgery at Houston's
Methodist Hospital about three weeks ago with his parents by his
side, a rod in his leg and a slew of questions about the future.
</P>
<P>
   How would he return to Los Angeles? Once there, how would he
navigate campus? What about his rehabilitation program? What
services were available to handicapped athletes? How would he eat?
Who paid for the surgery?
</P>
<P>
   His parents, Joyce and Freddie Sr., had few answers. They
weren't even sure if UCLA would pay for the flight to Houston from
their home in Lakeland, Fla. _ a flight they boarded soon after
seeing Mitchell break his left femur against Houston on Sept. 19.
Mitchell will miss the rest of the season, his absence felt even
more deeply after the suspension of tailback Jermaine Lewis for
Saturday's game against No.10 Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   In the following days, it became clear to the Mitchells: The
grotesque injury would trigger the academic, medical and social
support services available to injured athletes at UCLA and around
the country. It's a hidden aspect of college athletics, but perhaps
the most important.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did a very professional job in the total situation,
starting from the time of the incident,'' Freddie Sr. said. ``I've
been very impressed with the services provided (by UCLA and the
NCAA). It's been very humanitarian. We haven't seen any color
lines, or any racial lines. It's been all love lines.''
</P>
<P>
   Preparations for Mitchell's return began that Monday morning _
two days before UCLA assistant trainer Tony Spino would fly to
Houston and escort Mitchell back to Westwood.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Stephens, director of student-athlete services, reviewed
Mitchell's financial forms and determined he qualified for federal
aid (a Pell Grant). That enabled UCLA to reimburse Mitchell's
parents for their flight, transportation, meals and lodging in
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The funding came not from the football budget, but from a
$44,000 Special Assistance Fund filtered from the NCAA through the
Pacific-10 Conference to its member institutions. UCLA's insurance
paid for Mitchell's surgery and hospital stay.
</P>
<P>
   Stephens relayed the financial information to Randy Taylor,
director of football operations, and Geoff Schaadt, the head
trainer, who were in constant communication with Mitchell and his
parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called Freddie on Sunday, talked to him for maybe 10
minutes, and by the time we got off the phone he was cheering me
up,'' Taylor said. ``The kid was amazing. He said, `Make sure you
don't recruit a receiver to take my place. I'll be back next
fall.'''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell returned eight days before the fall quarter began.
Campus housing agreed to let Mitchell and his roommate, kicker
Chris Griffin, move to their Sunset Village Apartments several days
early. (They had been living elsewhere during training camp and the
first weeks of September.) In addition, they were assigned a
first-floor room with a handicapped shower.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Mitchell couldn't raise his leg without help. Schaadt
and his staff visited every few hours. They brought food and drink
_ until classes began, dormitory meal service was unavailable _ and
performing rudimentary therapy to contain the swelling. Cards and
flowers poured in, and so did the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every guy on the team came by at least once,'' Griffin said.
``The first day, Freddie was fine until the team came. Once they
got to talking, that's when he broke down.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell started with a walker, then graduated to crutches. His
therapy has expanded in turn. Schaadt uses electrical stimulation
and a series of exercises (including the Lifecycle) to increase
Mitchell's range of motion. He does not wear a cast or a brace. The
steel rod and two interlocking screws provide all the stability he
needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked terrible on replay... but I expect Freddie to be 100
percent by (spring practice),'' Schaadt said. ``Everybody talks
about him losing a step, but there's no reason he should.''
</P>
<P>
   Once classes began, Mitchell qualified for the services provided
by UCLA's Office for Students with Disabilities. (All University of
California schools have one.) The office provides counseling,
workshops, registration assistance, notetakers, support groups and
campus-wide transportation service. Each morning Mitchell eases
into a van, which whisks him from class to class, building to
building. Fearing dependency, he has taken to walking home from the
training room after physical therapy.
</P>
<P>
   As the fall quarter approached, the academic services department
kicked into gear. Director Sheila Gardette adjusted Mitchell's
schedule, eliminating classes with labs, which require not only
extra time but also an additional building. Assistant director Ed
Kezirian notified the professors that a disabled student could
shuffle into their lectures a few minutes late.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell is taking science, history and music; he may add a
fourth class if manageable. He usually sits in the front row (more
leg room) but sometimes opts for the rear if a free table is
available. His tutoring is in Covel Commons, a few feet from Sunset
Village Apartments.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have great facilities, great everything,'' he said. ``If
I need anything, I've got a lot of love and support.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON, England _ When the Bank of England's secretive
Monetary Policy Committee decides Thursday whether to lower
interest rates, its members may not be thinking too much about Hugh
Morgan Williams. But he will most certainly be thinking about them.
</P>
<P>
   ``If rates don't move down at all, then my view of the Monetary
Policy Committee is unprintable, absolutely unprintable,'' said
Morgan Williams, whose company, Canford Audio PLC, makes products
ranging from the devices used by the police to record witnesses'
testimony to radio station control consoles.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, he said, export earnings by his modest company
in this blustery factory park in northeastern England have fallen
because the strong British pound makes his products more expensive
for foreign buyers. For every German pfennig added to the price of
sterling, he said, his earnings in Germany shrink by $100,000 a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Such tribulations have created a clamor from British business
for lower rates and a weaker pound. Indeed, after Spain cut its
benchmark rates half a point, to 3.75 percent, on Tuesday, there
was a crescendo of demands for a cut in Britain's 7.5 percent
benchmark.
</P>
<P>
   Even the government _ which last year handed over responsibility
for setting rates to the Bank of England _ has acknowledged that
the outlook has changed from the heady days earlier this year when
Britain seemed to be emulating the United States' coupling of low
unemployment and surging growth.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown told the annual meeting
of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in
Washington, D.C., on Tuesday, ``Slower world growth makes it
inevitable that growth in Britain next year will be more
moderate.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the land, signs of a slowdown are apparent. Ford Motor
Co.'s British subsidiary last month put the 4,400 workers in its
Dagenham plant on a four-day week. This month, Rover Group, owned
by BMW AG, said it would temporarily halt production of its 200 and
400 models in December, after announcing 1,500 layoffs in July.
</P>
<P>
   The signs are all too familiar in the Washington region, where
bust has followed boom with metronomic predictability _ from the
gradual demise of coal mining and shipbuilding, beginning in the
1970s, to the Thatcherite 1980s, which marked Britain's decline as
a manufacturing nation.
</P>
<P>
   The pound's rise during the last three years _ caused partly by
investors' search for a hedge against the Euro, the single European
currency set to be introduced next January _ has compounded other
woes in a region that once looked to foreign investment as a
panacea. The collapse of the global semiconductor industry
contributed directly to the closing in August and September of two
big plants by Siemens AG and Fujitsu, at a cost of 1,700 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every week, in a region stretching to Scotland, foreign
companies have slashed work forces. National Semiconductor said
just this week that it would shed 600 jobs at Greenock in western
Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   The job losses have left few options for policy-makers, who have
relied on foreign investment to create 75,000 jobs since 1986.
``Can anyone seriously suggest,'' said Sir George Russell, chairman
of the Northern Development Co., a government agency, ``that this
approach should be abandoned and something else put in its place?''
</P>
<P>
   The fruits of those investments are clear. But with 9.1 percent
unemployment _ almost twice the figure in the southeast _ and an
economy that draws 44 percent of its output from exports, those
chill winds are blowing again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are much more vulnerable than most other regions,'' said
Morgan Williams, who is also regional chairman of the Confederation
of British Industries, the main employers' association. And though
the pound has fallen 11 percent against the German mark in six
months, any sustained fall, he said, ``would take 18 to 24 months
to have an impact on manufacturing.''
</P>
<P>
   In this region alone in recent months, 4,500 manufacturing jobs
have been lost _ but 6,000 have been created in businesses like
telephone call-centers, which provide fewer full-time jobs and
contribute less to local suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   Those companies that survive do so on leaner profits. While
Siemens and Fujitsu are departing, the giant Nissan Motor auto
factory near Washington has pledged not only to stay but also to
expand. But profits will be down, reflecting the shock of the
strong pound on a plant that produces 60 percent of the Nissans
marketed in continental Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Williams' factory is much smaller, but the pressures are
similar. This year, his company expects profits to be up, meaning
that his 179 employees have not been threatened with layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   But expectations are lower. ``We managed to increase market
share in Europe,'' he said, ``by accepting that we are not going to
make a lot of money doing it.''

</P>

   House and Senate Republicans agreed on a sweeping overhaul of
the bankruptcy system, making it more difficult for consumers to
walk away from their debts and handing the banking and credit-card
industries a victory.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement was reached without the consent of congressional
Democrats or the White House, and administration officials said
they would recommend that President Clinton veto the bill because
of its treatment of low-income consumers.

   HOPE OF RECOVERY BOLSTERS NIKKEI
</P>
<P>
   The Liberal Democratic Party, the governing party of Japan,
edged closer to injecting huge amounts of money into the banking
system, and that prospect sent investors rushing into markets with
greater hope of an economic recovery. The benchmark Nikkei average
of 225 shares soared 803.97 points, or 6.2 percent, to 13,825.61.

<P>
   NO UNIFIED APPROACH TO GLOBAL CRISIS

   The world's finance ministers and its central bankers ended five
days of debate with nothing approaching a strategy to lift the
global markets out of their downward spiral.

<P>
   TALKS PICK UP ON IMF FINANCING
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration and congressional Republicans said
they were working frantically to agree on legislation to provide
$18 billion to the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   RAYTHEON RAISES NUMBER OF LAYOFFS
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon said it would add to previously announced layoffs and
would not meet expectations for third-quarter earnings. The company
now plans to shed 14,000 jobs, or roughly 16 percent of its work
force.
</P>
<P>
   PENNSYLVANIA HOUSE AIDS ALLIED BID
</P>
<P>
   Shares of AMP rose as much as 6.3 percent as investors expressed
optimism that legislation passed by the Pennsylvania House of
Representatives could help Allied Signal in its $9.7 billion
takeover bid for the company.
</P>
<P>
   DEALS SHOW STRENGTH OF AMAZON
</P>
<P>
   Despite proposed mergers among online merchants in both books
and music, and a sharp decline in the stock price of Amazon.com,
analysts argued that it was Amazon's competition that should be
worried because of the retailer's dominance. There is increasing
concern about whether the No. 2 player can survive.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo, the online directory, reported another quarter of robust
growth, helping restore some investor confidence to the volatile
Internet sector. Yahoo said it earned $16.7 million, or 15 cents a
share, in the third quarter.

BIPARTISAN HOUSE REJECTS BROAD BILL ON PUBLIC LANDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ By an overwhelming bipartisan vote, the House of
Representatives Wednesday bowed to the objections of
environmentalists and the threat of a veto and rejected
wide-ranging legislation on parks and public lands in dozens of
states.
</P>
<P>
   The bill was an effort, in the closing days of the 105th
Congress, to combine scores of relatively minor and uncontroversial
proposals involving trails, parks and other public lands with a few
significant and hotly disputed changes in the management of big
tracts of wilderness and national forest. It was supported by House
Republican leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Among the provisions that the Clinton administration had opposed
was a proposal by the bill's main author, Rep. James Hansen,
R-Utah, to set aside for conservation the 630,000-acre San Rafael
Swell, the rugged canyonlands where the outlaw Butch Cassidy used
to hide out.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists also opposed it, saying it did not set aside
enough land for wilderness and did not provide strict-enough
protections.
</P>
<P>
   Other disputed provisions would have given the Chugach tribe in
Alaska easements to build a road over sensitive lands, and eased
logging and grazing on public lands that are susceptible to
wildfires.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's resounding defeat, by a vote of 123 to 302, was a
striking victory for environmental groups at a time when many
provisions they oppose are tucked away in spending bills that
Congress is considering this week.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition came mainly from liberal Democrats and centrist
Republicans, although some conservative Republicans said they
opposed the bill because it did not go far enough to protect
private property owners.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Sherwood Boehlert, R-N.Y., who leads a bloc of the party's
pro-environment lawmakers, said the bill ``holds perfectly good
projects hostage so as to jam through Congress bad policies that
don't have a prayer of being adopted individually.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska, who is chairman of the House
Resources Committee, bluntly warned members not to seek his
approval for their favorite park projects next year after voting
against this bill.

17 CHARGED IN BRIBERY SCHEME AT FEDERAL COURT IN BROOKLYN 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Saying that he had found corruption in his own
backyard, the chief federal prosecutor in Brooklyn announced
Wednesday that six federal employees had taken bribes from
contractors on renovation and repair jobs in federal buildings,
including some payoffs received in the halls of the courthouse
where the case will now be tried.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows what accounts for the brazenness,'' said Zachary
Carter, the U.S. attorney in Brooklyn. Carter said that a two-year
undercover investigation had found that dozens of the illegal
payoffs _ some of them secretly recorded by the authorities _ were
made in elevators, hallways, the boiler room and other areas of the
U.S. District Courthouse in downtown Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   But Carter said he was not surprised to learn that graft had
invaded the building where he and his staff also work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the federal courthouse is immune,'' he said at a
news conference in his office, in a building near the courthouse.
``It could happen anywhere.'' Carter also announced the arrests of
the federal employees and 10 private contractors charged with
paying or offering them the bribes.
</P>
<P>
   In what officials said was the largest corruption prosecution in
the history of the General Services Administration _ the agency
responsible for the buildings that federal courts and agencies
occupy _ one veteran GSA supervisor, Patrick McCosker, was said to
have received about $100,000 in bribes for helping contractors gain
renovation and maintenance jobs at the courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   The five other agency supervisors, who like McCosker had the
title of assistant building manager, were described in court papers
as having received relatively small amounts _ ``several thousand
dollars'' or, in one case, $6,000. But one investigator, who spoke
on the condition of anonymity, said that for some of the
defendants, ``these are conservative estimates'' and that the
continuing investigation was expected to find that those defendants
had pocketed far more. All together, investigators said, the
payoffs helped the contractors obtain millions of dollars' worth of
jobs. The assistant U.S. attorney handling the case, Leslie
Cornfeld, said the agency supervisors' salaries ranged from $45,000
to $63,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the courthouse, the other buildings involved in what the
authorities called ``widespread bribery and kickback schemes'' are
privately owned structures, where the major tenants are federal
agencies.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The agency supervisors were not operating together but were
rather engaged in separate schemes at various times between 1993
and 1997, Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that sometimes the agency employees took the initiative
in soliciting bribes and kickbacks and that sometimes the
contractors did.
</P>
<P>
   He said the investigation leading to the charges announced
Wednesday began when a contractor, whom he would not identify,
reported to the federal agency's management that one of its
employees ``may have solicited bribes.'' The investigation that
followed, he said, employed confidential informers whom he did not
identify but who appear to have included at least one employee of a
contractor company and one agency employee.
</P>
<P>
   The agency supervisors charged in the case, who were arrested
Wednesday and charged in criminal complaints, are all longtime
employees of the agency, with service ranging from 10 years to 23
years. The 10 contractors are affiliated with companies that do
construction and renovation, or that specialize in areas like
mechanical and electrical systems, doors and locks, and carpet
care.
</P>
<P>
   All six federal employees and three of the contractors were
arraigned Wednesday in the same Brooklyn courthouse at the center
of the alleged corruption, and all were released on $100,000 bonds
pending further court action. They were not required to enter pleas
at the arraignment, and none did. Their lawyers declined to comment
as they and their clients left the courthouse.

UMPIRE SLICES IT LOWER AND WIDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ted Hendry, the plate umpire, interpreted the strike zone
consistently, which is exactly what players say they prefer. But
Hendry's strike zone, as always, was larger than most, perhaps a
couple of inches beyond the black border on either side of the
plate, perhaps an inch lower than most strike zones.
</P>
<P>
   These parameters changed the way Wednesday's Yankees-Indians
game was played, both benefiting and hurting both sides.
</P>
<P>
   David Cone usually relies on his slider, and yet in the early
innings, he could not maintain his mechanics, his front shoulder
flying open, and he could not control the pitch, leaving him
vulnerable; Cone needs his slider to keep opposing batters from
locking in on his fastball. He kept falling behind in the count,
against six of the first 11 batters he faced.
</P>
<P>
   But Cone and his catcher, Joe Girardi, recognized quickly that
Hendry was particularly generous calling inside strikes on
left-handed batters, and through the middle innings, Cone would
keep firing fastballs at that one spot whenever he needed a big
pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Cone threw a staggering 32 pitches in the fourth inning, but
allowed just one run, on a home run by David Justice. Two of the
three outs in the inning were on called third strikes, on inside
fastballs to left-handed batters Omar Vizquel and Jim Thome.
Hendry's strike zone bought Cone time to find his stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Hendry's strike zone, too, foiled the strategy of the Yankees'
hitters, to take pitches and work Cleveland's Charles Nagy deep
into ball-strike counts. Twelve of the first 13 Yankee batters took
the first pitch, to little effect; the wider strike zone put them
on the defensive thereafter, and Nagy needed only 66 pitches to get
through the first six innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees had only three hits and _ horrors _ they trailed,
1-0, in the seventh, the first time in the entire post-season
another team held a lead against them.
</P>
<P>
   Bernie Williams opened the seventh inning with a single,
however, and Tino Martinez drew a four-pitch walk. Yankee fans,
dormant since the early innings, roared in anticipation. The rally
appeared to crumble when Tim Raines tried unsuccessfully to drop a
sacrifice bunt _ something he had never attempted in the regular
season _ and then struck out.
</P>
<P>
   Shane Spencer then smashed a long drive to deep center. Perhaps
on a warmer day in July or August, the ball would have carried over
the wall and Spencer would have been responsible for a jubilant
riot in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   The chilled air helped prevent the drive from departing,
however, Kenny Lofton catching it near the wall for the second out;
Williams tagged up and moved to third.
</P>
<P>
   But Scott Brosius, who led the American League with a .374
average with runners in scoring position this year, pulled a high
off-speed pitch into the left-field corner, driving home Williams
with the tying run. Nagy was removed, disconsolate as he slumped
off the mound.

POLL INDICATES VOTERS BELIEVE CLINTON BROUGHT IT ALL ON HIMSELF  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ While differing over whether to remove President
Clinton from office, many of the voters surveyed in a new
Washington state poll tend to agree about who is responsible for
the messy, seemingly endless investigation of the 42nd president _
Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, conducted by Mason-Dixon Political/Media Research,
asked the question: ``Generally speaking, who do you hold most
responsible for things getting to the point that they have?''
</P>
<P>
   The president was named by 43 percent of those responding. But
voters interviewed also assigned generous shares of blame to the
media as well as special prosecutor Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere in the poll, which interviewed 412 women and 398 men,
were there greater gender differences.
</P>
<P>
   Among men surveyed, the buck stops with Clinton. A total of 54
percent blamed the president, 21 percent the media, and only 10
percent Starr; 11 percent answered ``all of them.''
</P>
<P>
   With women, by contrast, just 32 percent said Clinton was to
blame. Another 28 percent faulted Starr, 21 percent blamed the
media, and seven percent answered ``all of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Monica Lewinsky figures hardly at all in the ascribing of blame.
She was listed by only 1 percent of men, and 3 percent of women.
And few blamed Republicans in Congress, although there was
criticism that the investigation is being drawn out for political
purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Women have a different way of looking at blame, said Cathy
Allen, a Democratic consultant and leader of a campaign called
``Enough!'' that seeks to cap the investigation of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a measure of guys to find one villain,'' she said. ``The
nature of a woman is to find a much bigger picture. They look at
this situation as having enough blame to spread around.''
</P>
<P>
   Differences were apparent among those interviewed in the poll,
which was conducted Monday and Tuesday for the Seattle
Post-Intelligencer and Seattle TV station KOMO News 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he (Clinton) had been truthful, we would never have had
this situation. If he had been an honorable man, he would never
have become involved in a relationship like this or, if it were
exposed, he would have resigned,'' said Loren Stueckle, 51, an
optomotrist from Selah.
</P>
<P>
   But Karen Aanes, 64, of Tacoma, part-owner of an electric sign
business, argued: ``I'm of the opinion that your personal life is
your own, and I just think Mr. Starr or the Republicans are out to
get him. All they think about is causing trouble when every doggone
one of them, if they got caught in that situation, would lie.''
</P>
<P>
   Opinion did not always break on gender lines.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Harrif, 60, a horse trainer who also lives in Selah, noted
that the current scandal is rooted in a U.S. Supreme Court decision
that allowed Paula Jones to go ahead with her sexual harassment
lawsuit against Clinton. In Harrif's view, it provided Starr with
an opportunity ``to go after him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Starr) has extra power, he can do anything he wants,''
Hariff said. He argued that the investigation of Clinton ``is tying
up the country'' at a time when the president should be able to
concentrate on the international economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   But Stephanie Porcella, 52, a Bremerton nurse, blamed Clinton.
``He covered it up,'' she said. ``He sat there, dealt from a
position of his power, and used it.''
</P>
<P>
   One respondent to the poll, who asked not to be named, denounced
what he called ``the Washington, D.C., media'' for its months-long
obsession with the Monica Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``They cannot seem, any time and any way, to cover any issue
that is important to the average person working for a living in
this country,'' she said. ``They seem all wound up in power and
scandal, and not connected at all to the rest of us.''

 &HT;    Execution of Texas murderer complete
 &HT;    By Leah Quin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Arms bound to a gurney, Jonathan Nobles
apologized to relatives of the Austin women he murdered in 1986 and
to the man he nearly killed in the same attack. He recited from the
Bible _ the famous ``love is patient, love is kind'' passage from I
Corinthians _ and began singing ``Silent Night.''
</P>
<P>
   Just after the line ``mother and child,'' he gasped and choked.
The lethal drugs had collapsed his lungs.
</P>
<P>
   Nobles had asked prison officials to start his execution as soon
as he began singing, an unprecedented request. Five minutes later,
at 6:25 p.m. Wednesday, he was dead.
</P>
<P>
   It was an extraordinary end to a man who became known for issues
far different from the gruesome killings that landed him on death
row.
</P>
<P>
   Nobles tried to become the first condemned prisoner to donate
his organs to strangers. His efforts attracted the attention of
Michigan doctor Jack Kevorkian, who was pushing for inmate organ
donations long before he became a national figure for presiding
over assisted suicides.
</P>
<P>
   Nobles was the first inmate executed who participated in
mediation with the mother of one of his victims. Wednesday night, a
tearful Paula Kurland, mother of Mitzi Johnson Nalley, said those
talks helped her forgive Nobles.
</P>
<P>
   On his last day, Nobles was visited by a Catholic bishop from
the Tyler, Texas, a priest from Boston and a country singer from
Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Earle, a maverick country entertainer who released the
critically acclaimed album ``El Corazon'' in 1997, has often spoken
against the death penalty. Earle gave a short statement after the
execution, calling it murder and saying if he had to die, he hoped
to do it ``half as well as Jonathan did.''
</P>
<P>
   Relatives of Nalley, 21, and Kelly Joan Farquhar, 24, who were
stabbed to death in a predawn attack at their North Austin home,
hugged each other as they watched Nobles die. Also present was
Ronald Ross, a friend of Nalley's who struggled with Nobles the
night of the attack, was stabbed 19 times and lost an eye.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at each in turn and addressing them by first name,
Nobles told Nalley's mother and sister and Farquhar's brother that
he was ``so sorry.'' He then turned to Ross.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ron, I took so much from you,'' he said. ``There's nothing I
can do to give it back to you. I love you. I love all of you.''
</P>
<P>
   Ross clenched his jaw and pressed his open left palm against the
glass separating him from Nobles.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nobles, who converted to Catholicism a few years ago, also
thanked the priests and his friends who were present. ``I'll see
all of y'all at the church later on,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Kurland, Ross and Kent Farquhar, Kelly's brother,
talked to the media about Nobles' death, 11 years after the murders
that changed their lives. They've become an extended family, said
Kurland, who along with others in the room wore a photograph of
Nalley pinned to her blouse.
</P>
<P>
   Kurland said she realized two weeks ago, during the last
mediation session with Nobles, that the inmate had truly changed.
It was in his eyes, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched his eyes for 13 months at the trial,'' Kurland said.
``And I saw nothing there, they were just dead. What I saw two
weeks ago _ he had found God genuinely and spiritually.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobles was forgiven, she said, even by his victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both of them (Nalley and Farquhar) might be talking to him
right now,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Nobles was said to be calm and reserved during his final day,
which he spent visiting with friends, his lawyer and a priest. He
drank a kiwi strawberry Snapple but refused a last meal. He
received communion around 3 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview a month before his death, Nobles said he wanted
to donate his organs to do something positive after ``bringing so
much darkness into this world.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are sins of commission as well as sins of omission, and
for me not to attempt to do whatever I can that's good is wrong of
me,'' he said from an interview room in the Ellis Unit, the prison
near Huntsville that houses death row.
</P>
<P>
   As Nobles' execution date neared, a Michigan attorney requested
a stay of execution until the question of death-row organ donation
could be settled. Both the stay and the lawsuit were rejected by a
federal judge in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Texas prison officials remained adamant in their assertion that
condemned prisoners are not allowed to donate organs because of
security concerns, the possibility of transmitting diseases and the
dilemma of keeping a death row inmate alive if the operation goes
awry.
</P>
<P>
   Because the chemicals used in lethal injection damage organs, an
organ transplant would have to occur before execution. A living
donor can give a kidney, bone marrow, a lung, a lobe of the liver,
and skin, doctors say.
</P>
<P>
   While the Houston judge acknowledged that the organ-donor
question should be resolved, he ruled that Nobles didn't need to
live until it is.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, Nobles entered a North Austin home and attacked
Farquhar in her bed, stabbing her more than a dozen times in the
chest, back and head with a large hunting knife. When Nalley, who
was asleep with Ross in another bedroom, came to investigate the
noise, Nobles chased her into a closet, stabbing her 28 times.
</P>
<P>
   Ross fought the assailant and was stabbed repeatedly before he
managed to turn the knife on Nobles, cutting him deeply in the arm.
When Nobles fled, Ross struggled outside, screaming for help, and
collapsed in the street.
</P>
<P>
   It was never known why Nobles, a former telemarketer and
electrician, entered the apartment. He had been staying with his
godmother on Alegria Street, less than a block from the apartment
Farquhar and Nalley shared on Sunshine Drive, near Lamar Boulevard
and Koenig Lane.
</P>
<P>
   Nobles was arrested a week later, after friends who helped him
bandage his wound called police. He confessed to the slayings,
saying he was high on cocaine and methamphetamines, but insisted he
knew what he was doing. Kurland said she never asked Nobles why he
committed the murders. No answer would have satisfied her, she
said.

 &HT;    Clemson to meet Maryland on Saturday

   CLEMSON vs. Maryland, Saturday, noon
</P>
<P>
   While Florida coach Steve Spurrier has called off his rotating
quarterback experiment, Clemson's Tommy West is just beginning his.
He said he will use Woody Dantzler and Brandon Streeter, depending
on the situation. Dantzler's option skills didn't get much
accomplished in last week's loss to North Carolina, and Streeter
came on late to take the Tigers within two yards of tying up the
contest. . . . OG Corey Hulsey (hyperextended knee) is probable,
while OG Matt Butler (sprained ankle) is questionable. . . . Former
Monroe Area standout Chris Jones is one of the bright lights on a
defensive unit that leads the ACC in rushing defense (106.2 yards)
and sacks (tied with Virginia with 15). Jones leads the team with
64 tackles (12.8 per game).

   DUKE at Wake Forest, Saturday, 6:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Fred Goldsmith says he's mad and not going to take it
anymore. The Blue Devils, owners of a league-record 21 straight ACC
losses, play Wake Forest, the team they beat for their last league
win. ``We're a team that's sort of mad,'' said Goldsmith. ``We were
disappointed the way we played down at Georgia Tech. Now the Devils
must face Wake quarterback Brian Kuklick, who is rated the
third-best in the ACC and for whom Goldsmith has much admiration.
``Kuklick is such a good quarterback and so many good things happen
because of him,'' Goldsmith said. ``Last year we were so worried
about Kuklick, Wake had a record-setting day running the ball
against us. Kuklick led comebacks against Northwestern two years
ago and against us last year in a game that we were ahead in.''
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA STATE at Miami, Saturday, 3:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   One of the big games in the country used to be Miami vs. Florida
State. Saturday, the ninth-ranked Seminoles will meet the unranked
Hurricanes in a game that's received little fanfare. FSU will be
without the services of starting free safety Dexter Jackson
(hamstring pull) and tailback Travis Minor (ankle sprain) won't be
100 percent. ``We hope Travis will be able to play,'' said coach
Bobby Bowden, ``but he's still limping in practice and you can't
beat Miami with a limp.'' Bowden says his 4-1 Seminoles have
suffered this year due to a lack of senior leadership. ``We're
probably about one year more experienced than Miami,'' he said.
``We're playing a lot of juniors and sophomores where they're
playing a lot of sophomores and freshmen.''
</P>
<P>
   MARYLAND at Clemson, Saturday, noon
</P>
<P>
   True freshman Randall Jones has been declared the No. 1
quarterback, demoting preseason starter Ken Mastrole, who has
struggled. Jones was signed as a defensive back but converted
because of his speed and option-style game. ``He is ready, the team
is ready,'' head coach Ron Vanderlinden said. . . . The Byrd
Stadium crowd booed when Jones was replaced by Mastrole in the
third quarter Saturday. . . . The 24-10 loss to Florida State was
the closest for the Terrapins since the Seminoles joined the ACC. .
. . True freshman Tony Okanlawon is getting a look at first-string
cornerback behind Lynde Washington. . . . Through their first five
games, the Terps have used a total of 28 underclassmen on a regular
basis.
</P>
<P>
   NORTH CAROLINA vs. Pittsburgh, Saturday, 1:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   After beating Clemson last week, coach Carl Torbush says it was
long overdue and much needed. ``I can't remember seeing a happier
team after that win in my 11 years here,'' he said. Now Pittsburgh
(2-2) comes to Chapel Hill and Torbush says the Tar Heels will
again have their backs against the wall. ``Pitt is an outstanding
team. They've lost to Virginia Tech and Penn State, two of the best
teams in the country.'' Torbush says he plans to alternate
quarterbacks Ronald Curry and Oscar Davenport against the Panthers.
Curry received a bruised left shoulder early in the Clemson win and
Davenport played most of the game, but Curry will be ready to play
against Pitt. Receiver L.C. Stevens, who missed two games with an
ankle injury, will also be available Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   N.C. STATE vs. Ga. Tech, Saturday, 3:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   DE Greg Derrick is probable, but PK Scott Earwood will play only
as an emergency punter after limited action in a Sunday practice.
Coach Mike O'Cain said Earwood's kicking leg is still extremely
sore because of a stress fracture. . . . Although walk-on PK Daniel
Deskevich kicked four extra points and a field goal against
Syracuse, O'Cain said he hasn't decided whether to use him or
backup Kent Passingham, who was benched last week. ``Both of them
have been inconsistent,'' O'Cain said. ``We're going to continue to
see what they can do the rest of the week.'' . . . After an
agonizing 1997 season in which his job status was up in the air,
O'Cain said he doesn't feel any need to be vindicated after a
strong start this year: ``I don't believe in vindication. I'm just
very grateful to be the coach here.''
</P>
<P>
   VIRGINIA Off; at Ga. Tech, Oct. 17
</P>
<P>
   The unbeaten Cavaliers, who have a week off before their key ACC
game at Georgia Tech, appear to be the most dangerous team in the
league right now. Besides a strong passing game with Aaron Brooks
throwing to Terrence Wilkins, the Cavaliers lead the ACC in
rushing, averaging 227 yards. Tailback Thomas Jones leads the
conference with 107.2 yards per game, 23rd nationally. Antwoine
Womack is third in the league with a 78.6 average per game. Still
coach George Welsh isn't satisfied. He's concerned with his
receivers' inability to separate themselves from their defenders
and concerned with the lack of depth on his offensive line. ``But
we were able to give the second-team offensive line about 25-30
plays against San Jose State last week.''
</P>
<P>
   WAKE FOREST vs. Duke, Saturday, 6:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   So much for being ranked preseason No. 22 by Sports Illustrated.
The Demon Deacons were beaten 30-27 by Division I-AA Appalachian
State last week. The Deacons are now 2-2, their other loss 42-0 to
Air Force. Now weak-sister Duke comes calling at Groves Stadium and
the Deacons are anxious to get back on the field. . . . Wake Forest
expects to rely heavily on their pass-catching duo of Desmond Clark
and Jammie Deese. Clark has 28 catches for 361 yards and three
touchdowns while Deese has 24 grabs for 281 yards and one score.
Brian Kuklick has completed 61 percent of his passes for 908 yards
and six TDs. ``We know we've got a better team than we've shown and
I'm glad we'll get a chance to show what we can do,'' Kuklick said.

 &HT;    Petit Le Mans may help rev up sports car racing
 &HT;    By Kent Mitchell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Drivers and racing officials alike hope Saturday's
Petit Le Mans at Road Atlanta will trigger an upturn of fortunes
for sports car racing.
</P>
<P>
   The race offers the finest, largest field of competition of its
type seen in America this year, over a newly renovated 2.6-mile
Grand Prix road course. It is the cornerstone of a Le Mans series
that will begin in full next year.
</P>
<P>
   The Petit is a scaled-down version of the 24 Hours of Le Mans.
Saturday's race will go either 1,000 miles or 10 hours, whichever
comes first.
</P>
<P>
   It features some of the best drivers and cars in sports car
racing _ World Sports Cars, Grand Tourism 1, GT2, GT3, Le Mans
Prototype _ on what has become, in the past few months of
renovation, one of the finest road-course tracks in the country, if
not the world.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 40 of the 100-plus drivers involved with the 31 cars are
European. They are here because the winner automatically qualifies
for next year's 24 Hours of Le Mans.
</P>
<P>
   The Le Mans winner this year, the No. 26 Porsche 911 GT1-98, is
entered and should be considered the favorite. Driving duties are
shared by Uwe Alzen of Germany, Yannick Dalmas of France and Allan
McNish of Scotland, the only driver from the winning Le Mans team
to have raced here.
</P>
<P>
   The WSC-class winner, an Atlanta-sponsored car, also is entered.
The No. 7 Lease Plan Ferrari 333SP, which finished eighth at Le
Mans, will be driven by Wayne Taylor of Altamonte Springs, Fla.,
Eric van de Poele of San Diego and Emmanuel Collard of France.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor trails WSC points leader Butch Leitzinger of State
College, Pa., by 10 points and might be leading except for some
problems at a race earlier in the year at Road Atlanta. Pirelli
tires used by the Ferrari were too big for the rims and kept
slipping during the race, causing control problems.
</P>
<P>
   Leitzinger also is entered in the No. 8 Ford/Riley &AMP; Scott
MkIII, along with Scott Schubot of West Palm Beach, Fla., and Henry
Camferdam of Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the three Team Panoz entries competed in the 24 Hours of
Le Mans. Their drivers constitute six of the top 10 in Professional
Sports Car Racing's GT1 point standings, including the top three:
Co-leaders Andy Wallace of France and David Brabham of England and
No. 3 Eric Bernard of France. The others are No. 7 Doc Bundy of
Gainesville, No. 9 Johnny O'Connell of Phoenix and No. 10 Jamie
Davies of England.
</P>
<P>
   Brabham and Wallace, who finished seventh together at Le Mans,
along with Scott Pruett of Granite Bay, Calif., will drive the No.
4 Panoz GT1; Bernard, O'Connell and Davies will drive the No. 5
Panoz GT1, and Bundy, John Nielsen of Denmark and Christophe
Tinseau of France will drive the No. 007 Panoz GT1 hybrid, which
combines a V8 engine with an electric motor, and didn't qualify at
Le Mans.
</P>
<P>
   The field also includes nine Indy 500 veterans, eight Formula
One veterans and winning drivers in the 24 Hours of Le Mans and the
Rolex 24 Hours at Daytona such as Dalmas, Hurley Haywood, Hans
Stuck, Christophe Bouchut, Mauro Baldi, Michele Alboreto and Stefan
Johansson.
</P>
<P>
   Like the man said, ``Build it and they will come.'' The drivers
are there, with their cars. On Saturday, they hope the fans will
come, too.

 &HT;    Hazardous waste site draws controversy
 &HT;    By Ralph K.M. Haurwitz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A delegation of Mexican officials urged the Bush
administration and state lawmakers Wednesday to block a proposed
disposal site for low-level radioactive waste.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the delegation said the state's plan to bury waste in
the desert near the West Texas town of Sierra Blanca threatens to
pollute water supplies, sour bilateral relations and reverse
economic progress in the region.
</P>
<P>
   They also criticized Gov. George W. Bush for not meeting with
them and other opponents of the site, and for repeated assertions
that his support for the project hinges on whether it is shown to
be safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel first of all there was a political decision, that
politics decided where this site would be,'' said Jeffrey Jones, a
member of the Mexican Congress from the state of Chihuahua. ``Now
that the site is chosen, they want to shift everything to
scientific facts. This type of project seems to fly in the face of
the intent of what the free trade agreement is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to the North American Free Trade Agreement
between Mexico, the United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Jones was among a dozen local, state and federal elected
officials from Mexico who met with Secretary of State Al Gonzales
and then held a news conference at the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission is scheduled
to consider on Oct. 22 whether to grant a license for construction
and operation of the site, which would receive waste from nuclear
power plants, medical centers, universities and other sources. The
500-acre site in Hudspeth County is about 18 miles from the Rio
Grande, a major water source and a dividing line between the United
States and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was unable to meet with the Mexican delegation because of a
scheduling conflict, said Linda Edwards, a spokeswoman for the
governor. Gonzales is his representative on the issue, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The governor has met with site opponents, including elected
officials from Mexico, on several occasions, Edwards said. For
example, Bush met with the governor of Chihuahua and the mayor of
El Paso three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush is confident the commissioners of the TNRCC will
judge the safety of the site based on sound science,'' Edwards
said.
</P>
<P>
   Two state administrative law judges have recommended that the
license be denied. The judges said the Texas Low-Level Radioactive
Waste Disposal Authority, which would own and operate the site, had
failed to provide sufficient evidence concerning its geologic
suitability and on socioeconomic matters.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is a thorny one for Bush, who has sought to cultivate
warm relations with Mexico as well as political support among
Texas' growing Hispanic population, which is mostly Democratic.
Guadalupe Rodriguez Martinez, a member of Nuevo Leon's state
legislature, said Texas' choice of a site in a low-income Hispanic
community with little political clout ``constitutes an act of
environmental racism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We call for the immediate consideration of the relocation of
this site,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican Congress has unanimously adopted a resolution
opposing the site. But three executive-branch agencies _ foreign
relations, energy and environment _ recently issued a communique
declaring that the disposal site meets Mexican and international
standards and ``does not represent a risk for the Mexican
population and environment as long as its construction, operation
and sealing are carried out as outlined in the documents.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas state Rep. Norma Chavez, an El Paso Democrat who is
secretary of the 35-member Mexican American legislative caucus,
said she would introduce a measure next year to reject the site if
the conservation commission issues a license.

CLINTON SAYS HOUSE MEMBERS SHOULD VOTE THEIR CONSCIENCES ON
IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton on Wednesday gave House members
public leeway to ``cast a vote of principle and conscience'' on a
Republican-drafted impeachment inquiry on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But White House advisers and Democratic House leaders worked
hard to draw as many party members as possible to vote instead for
a more limited investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's remarks allowed House Democrats facing tough
re-election fights to set their own course as the House votes to
begin only the third impeachment inquiry into a president's
actions. He spoke as some Democrats openly complained that they
were tired of White House pressure to short-circuit an inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Stopping short of some Democrats' hopes that he would tell them
to vote alongside Republicans and put the burden on them to be
fair, Clinton told reporters, ``It's up to others to decide what
happens to me and ultimately it's going to be up to the American
people to make a clear statement there.'' First Lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton and other aides, however, did keep up an effort to convince
the undecided to vote for their party's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   With the House under the control of a Republican majority, it is
certain to vote against the Democrats' call for a limited inquiry
into Clinton's deceptions of his relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
It will then move to pass the Republicans' broader impeachment
resolution, modeled on the one used to begin the Watergate inquiry
a quarter of a century ago, calling for Clinton to be investigated
``fully and completely.''
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the vote, a letter sent to the Judiciary Committee
by Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel, only bolstered the
Republicans' drive for an open-ended inquiry. Responding to a query
last week from the committee, Starr said that he ``cannot foreclose
the possibility of providing the House of Representatives'' with
additional findings of possible impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Starr would only say that some matters remained under active
investigation, although he made clear in his referral to Congress
that a sexual harassment accusation by Kathleen Willey, a former
White House volunteer, remained unresolved. Clinton has denied
under oath any misconduct with Ms. Willey.
</P>
<P>
   The phrasing of the Republicans' resolution leaves open the door
for the inquiry to move in any direction.
</P>
<P>
   With several dozen agonized Democrats still uncertain how they
will vote, Democratic House leaders went from meeting to meeting on
Wednesday looking for a way to preserve a semblance of party unity
and to prevent many of their members from joining the Republicans
on the crucial vote.
</P>
<P>
   After an impassioned and divided two-hour closed Democratic
caucus, House Democratic leaders revised their own inquiry
proposal, bringing it ever closer to the Republican version.
</P>
<P>
   The new Democratic plan calls for an investigation to end on
Dec. 31. It also leaves open the possibility that any inquiry could
move beyond Clinton's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky should Starr
present more evidence of impeachable offenses on other issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got a Republican proposal,'' said Rep. Dick Gephardt,
the House minority leader. ``You've got a Democratic proposal. Both
of them launch an inquiry. The question is how we're going to do
this. And a lot of our members feel very strongly that this should
be done right. This is a high moment for the House of
Representatives.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic leaders seemed resigned that they would lose anywhere
from two dozen to 60 party members on Thursday's vote. These
Democrats are expected to first vote for the Democratic plan, and
when that fails vote for the Republican plan.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond counting votes and reshaping their alternative, the
leadership was not pressuring House Democrats on how to vote. Rep.
Gary Ackerman, D-N.Y., said his party's leaders were most concerned
about minimizing losses in the looming mid-term election and
``don't want to drown anyone'' by trying to force party unity.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As the House vote neared, a prominent Senate Democrat took to
the floor of his chamber to warn the White House against meddling
on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would suggest by way of friendly advice to the White House:
Don't tamper with this jury,'' said Sen. Robert Byrd of West
Virginia, expressing his displeasure with White House efforts over
the weekend to convince 34 Democratic senators to sign a letter
saying they would not vote to convict the president, should he be
impeached.
</P>
<P>
   To his own colleagues, Byrd said: ``We may have to sit as
jurors. Don't let it be said that we allowed ourselves to be
tampered with.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton himself downplayed the idea that he was lobbying for his
survival. He said that while he was talking to House Democrats, ``a
large number called me. I'm attempting to call them all back and I
will try to do that.'' He said, ``More important than anything else
to me is that they do the people's work.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, demonstrating the turmoil in their ranks, had sharply
different views of what strategy was best for their party.
</P>
<P>
   While the leadership worked on the Democratic plan, Rep. James
Moran of Virginia, a moderate Democrat who has been in touch with
the White House, argued that it was better politically and
tactically for Democrats to vote with the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Such a stand, he argued, would give Democrats more credibility
eventually to vote against Clinton's impeachment. And he argued
that a partisan vote on Thursday would turn the November election
into a referendum on Clinton. ``If November 3 is a referendum on
the president's conduct, we lose,'' he said. ``The endgame for
Democrats is gaining control of the Congress and I don't think we
do that by playing on this field.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Democrats facing tough re-election bids worried that they
were facing what Rep. Calvin Dooley of California described as ``a
lose-lose vote here.'' He said he and colleagues feared that siding
with the Republicans would alienate base Democratic voters while
siding with the Republicans would drive away independent voters.
Dooley said that Clinton's advice to Democrats to vote their
conscience had done nothing to help with this dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Carolyn McCarthy, from a swing New York distirct on Long
Island said she would reluctantly vote for the Republican plan to
launch formal impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, this is probably going to be a no-win situation
for me back home, but the process has to go forward,'' Mrs.
McCarthy said. ``I'm not thrilled about how the Republicans have
made this open-ended, but I believe the process has to be moved
forward.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Eliot Engel, a New York City Democrat, said he strongly
opposed the Republicans' proposal. ``When I go back to my
district,'' he said, ``People are fed up with this. They say,
`Leave the president alone.' ''
</P>
<P>
   As the Democrats agonized, Republicans sat back and waited for
Thursday's vote. House Speaker Newt Gingrich said that Republican
leaders were not counting votes. ``There will be no arm-twisting,'
he said. ``Members need to take this vote as a matter of conscience
and we'll let the chips fall where they may tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, the two parties were still negotiating over
how much time would be alloted for the debate on opening an
impeachment inquiry. As a bargaining ploy, Democrats asked for
eight hours, while Republicans said they were hoping to hold the
debate to two or three hours.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House and Senate Republicans agreed Wednesday on a
vast overhaul of the bankruptcy system, making it more difficult
for consumers to walk away from their debts and handing the banking
and credit-card industries a major victory.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement was reached without the consent of congressional
Democrats or the White House, and administration officials said
they would recommend that President Clinton veto the bill because
of its treatment of low-income consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Republican agreement, only consumers with relatively
low incomes could declare bankruptcy under the rules that wipe out
many debts. But the agreement would give bankruptcy judges some
discretion in determining whether debtors could file under Chapter
7, which wipes out many debts, or under Chapter 13, which requires
the repayment of most debts.
</P>
<P>
   Debtors who earn more than the median income _ $17,900 for
single people and $51,000 for a family of four _ would be moved
into Chapter 13. Also sent into Chapter 13 would be debtors who
could repay 25 percent of their unsecured debts, like credit cards,
or $5,000 over five years.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiated bill weakens a Senate-passed requirement that
credit card companies disclose on each monthly bill how much
consumers will owe and for how long if they make only the minimum
payment.
</P>
<P>
   It also drops a Senate provision that sets a $100,000 limit on
the value of homes that could be kept by those declaring
bankruptcy. This means that people could still move to certain
states, like Florida and Texas, buy expensive homes, declare
bankruptcy and keep the entire worth of their homes. However, the
compromise bill requires these people to live in the adopted state
for at least two years before they can claim the homestead
exemption.
</P>
<P>
   With the perception that low-income Americans _ primarily women
and minorities, who are among Clinton's most reliable political
allies _ would be hurt most by the bill, Hillary Rodham Clinton has
argued against the House version, toward which the compromise
tilts.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's concern is that credit-card companies will have a
stronger claim than women and children on debtors _ usually
ex-husbands _ who file for bankruptcy but who owe child-support and
alimony payments.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans say that alimony and child support will be the first
priorities in any bankruptcy liquidation under this agreement, but
Democrats say the language is far from that clear.
</P>
<P>
   The industry supported the House-passed bill, which was guided
by a concern that filing for bankruptcy had become too easy and
that thousands of Americans were abusing the system. The Senate
bill started from the premise that easily available credit is also
responsible for the increase in bankruptcies and that the
credit-card industry needed to be held accountable along with
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Both the House and Senate had earlier approved vastly different
bills, and negotiators have been scrambling to iron out the
differences before Congress recesses this weekend. The Republican
agreement was sent to the House floor for a vote, which could come
as early as Thursday
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said Wednesday that they were happy with the
compromise and that it was fair, but Democrats were furious, none
more so than Sen. Richard Durbin of Illinois. He had joined
Republicans in seeking an overhaul of the bankruptcy system, and
his name gave the process bipartisan credibility. But he said he
was shut out of the final negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill, which had passed by a vote of 97-1, ``has been
devastated in a closed-door Republican conference,'' Durbin said.
``Republican conferees stripped out every significant consumer
protection in the Senate bill,'' he added. ``The president will not
sign this bill in its present form.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's agreement represents a huge success for banks,
credit-card companies and retailers. The lending industry spent
more than $40 million to lobby for the changes, which could help it
recoup an estimated $4 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   Bankruptcy filings reached a record 1.42 million over the 12
months ending on June 30, continuing a troubling three-year trend
that has persisted despite the robust economy. More than 1 million
of these bankruptcies were filed under Chapter 7, which erases all
debt except taxes, mortgages, student loans, child support, alimony
and, in some cases, loans on a car needed to get to work.
</P>
<P>
   The industry supported the House-passed bill, which was guided
by a concern that filing for bankruptcy had become too easy and
that thousands of Americans were abusing the system. The Senate
bill started from the premise that easily available credit is also
responsible for the increase in bankruptcies and that the
credit-card industry needed to be held accountable along with
consumers.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, who led the negotiations for the
Senate, said that the compromise protected honest consumers from
those who abused the bankruptcy rules. ``Consumers across the
country who work hard and pay their own way should not be forced to
subsidize the abusive spending practices of those who exploit the
federal bankruptcy code for personal gain or convenience,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   William Binzel, a lobbyist for MasterCard International, said
that complaints of a bill that let the industry off the hook were
unfounded. ``If a lender makes credit available to someone who
can't afford to repay it, the lender loses the principle and
interest,'' he said. ``The bill addresses the fundamental flaw in
the law that allows a debtor who can repay a portion of his debts
to use the system to walk away from those debts.''

UCLA'S LEWIS FILES BATTERY REPORT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Claiming he was the victim, suspended UCLA
tailback Jermaine Lewis filed a battery report Tuesday against the
unidentified man with whom he fought early Sunday morning at a
party near campus.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis' report came a day after Elonza Malone III filed a battery
complaint against Lewis. Malone told campus police that Lewis
struck him multiple times at the party on Landfair Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   After Malone filed his report, UCLA coach Bob Toledo suspended
Lewis indefinitely for violating team policy regarding fighting.
</P>
<P>
   A Lancaster native and UCLA's leading rusher, Lewis won't play
Saturday at Arizona. He may return as early as next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``My spirits are good,'' said Lewis, who declined to comment on
specifics of the incident or the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   According to team sources, Lewis told police that Malone threw
the first punch, catching Lewis by surprise, and that Lewis
retaliated in self defense. Several UCLA players eventually
separated the combatants.
</P>
<P>
   Malone claimed Lewis instigated the fight, then attacked Malone
a second time on the sidewalk, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Recruiting update: Ryan Wikert, a receiver/safety from Temecula,
orally committed to UCLA on Tuesday night. He is the second player
to commit, following Venice quarterback J.P. Losman. The Bruins
hope to sign 16-18 players in February.
</P>
<P>
   Wikert, 6-2 and 180 pounds, is projected to play free safety, a
position of need. (Redshirt freshman Jason Stephens is the only
young free safety on the roster.) He is highly regarded but lightly
recruited, according to Student Sports Magazine; San Diego State
was the only other school to offer a scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   Wiser than his years: Linebacker Tony White was named one of
four captains this week, becoming the first sophomore in the Toledo
era to be so honored.
</P>
<P>
   White was credited with six tackles against Washington State and
has 13 this season, tied for third on the team. He joins offensive
tackle Kris Farris, quarterback Cade McNown and safety Larry Atkins
as captains.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's crazy to have a sophomore as a captain, but he's one of
the better leaders on defense,'' Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   That says as much about the Bruins' inexperience as it does
White's maturity. They are expected to start three seniors, four
juniors, two sophomores and two freshmen against Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Pancakes, anyone? Farris, the All-American left tackle, has
dominated smaller opponents with his 6-9, 315-pound frame.
Saturday, he'll face Arizona's quick but undersized ends, Joe
Tafoya (255 pounds) and Eli Wnek (240).
</P>
<P>
   ``If you isolate on him, he's been mauling guys the last few
weeks,'' Toledo said. ``He smothers guys. Guys are 6-3 or 6-4 and
he towers over them.''

STARR MAY HAVE NEW MATERIAL FOR COMMITTEE 
</HEADLINE>
   (See also CLINTON-IMPEACH, CLINTON-LOBBY, CLINTON-FENCE)  
 (af)  
 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On the eve of a House vote on a formal impeachment
inquiry against President Clinton, the Whitewater independent
counsel, Kenneth Starr, told leaders of the judiciary committee
Wednesday night that he might be preparing to refer to Congress
matters that could become additional grounds for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Reps. Henry Hyde, the committee chairman, and
John Conyers Jr., the ranking Democrat, Starr said unspecified
matters remained under active investigation by the Office of
Independent Counsel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consequently, I cannot foreclose the possibility of providing
the House of Representatives with additional substantial and
credible information arising from those investigations that
President William Jefferson Clinton committed acts that may
constitute grounds for an impeachment,'' Starr wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde and Conyers wrote to Starr last Friday, asking whether he
would have information ``in the foreseeable future'' beyond that
given the committee last month in his 445-page report laying out 11
possible grounds for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Bakaly III, the spokesman for Starr's office, said Starr
wanted to respond to the congressional request as quickly as
possible. The letter was not timed in any way to affect the debate
this week on authorizing an impeachment inquiry, Bakaly said.
</P>
<P>
   Bakaly declined to elaborate on what matters still under
investigation might yield additional impeachment charges.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for White House counsel's office, James Kennedy,
said, ``We have nothing to add to a letter that adds nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   While Starr's letter included the provocative suggestion that
more evidence of possible impeachable offenses might be
forthcoming, investigators said there was no expectation that there
would be anything soon, if at all.
</P>
<P>
   Starr made clear in his Sept. 11 impeachment referral that many
aspects of his long-running examination of the president and
Hillary Rodham Clinton remained open.
</P>
<P>
   Starr said then: ``All phases of the investigation are now
nearing completion. This office will soon make final decisions
about what steps to take, if any, with respect to the other
information it has gathered. Those decisions will be made at the
earliest practical time, consistent with our statutory and ethical
obligations.''
</P>
<P>
   But lawyers following the inquiry said Wednesday night that his
latest letter was probably referring to other strands of the
Lewinsky case and not items like the dismissal of seven White House
travel office employees, the initial Whitewater inquiry and the
improper handling in the White House of hundreds of FBI background
files.
</P>
<P>
   With no grand jury in Arkansas now hearing any further testimony
about the political and financial dealings of the Clintons in the
1980s, the lawyers said, they did not expect Starr to forward any
additional material about Whitewater to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But the lawyers noted that Congress had received virtually no
material about the accusations made by Kathleen Willey, a former
White House volunteer, who has said she was groped by the president
in a West Wing encounter in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   In his testimony two months ago, Clinton denied Ms. Willey's
account, and Starr's staff has not decided whether to forward to
Congress any further report reconciling the contradictory
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation has also not resolved other issues in the
Lewinsky inquiry, including whether any witnesses were improperly
discouraged by the White House from testifying truthfully.
</P>
<P>
   The independent-counsel law also requires Starr to file a report
about his investigation to the special three-judge court that
oversees independent counsels. Once the report is filed, it is
almost certain to be many months before the court would make it
public.

BASEBALL COLUMN: A NO-BRAINER OF HIS OWN CREATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Along with the anxiety of a series taken for granted
that has suddenly turned scary comes the time-honored tradition of
the second-guess. As in: Try to guess what Chuck Knoblauch could
have possibly been thinking as he staked the outcome of a
4-hour-28-minute marathon on the assumption that an umpire's call
would go his way.
</P>
<P>
   Little Leaguers are admonished for what Knoblauch did, or didn't
do, as he waited for umpire Ted Hendry to lift his right arm in the
12th inning Wednesday night at Yankee Stadium. He stood on first
base, the ball behind him in the infield dirt, as the winning run
circled the bases. Inexcusable for a Little Leaguer. Unfathomable
for a major-league ball player, and not because he happens to earn
$6 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   So hold the confetti. Put away those brooms. The Cleveland
Indians, 4-1 winners in 12 exhausting innings Wednesday at Yankee
Stadium, will not be swept. If they can win two of three back home
in Jacobs Field this weekend, the most decorated team in American
League history will return home next week to face elimination in
Game 6.
</P>
<P>
   All right, that sounds mighty dire for a team that could just as
easily win the next three, but that's the typical playoff mind
game, day after gut-wrenching day. That's a message to those who
were going over those World Series pitching matchups with Atlanta
already. Stuff happens. Kids interfere with home run balls.
Major-leaguers suffer brain lock.
</P>
<P>
   The real postseason began Wednesday, after four games that
looked like George Steinbrenner's blueprint for his own fantasy. A
tense, fierce struggle resulted in a series of failed Yankee
opportunities, one or two debatable moves by Joe Torre and,
finally, Knoblauch's dishonoring of the most rudimentary rule in
sports.
</P>
<P>
   Did he have a case that Travis Fryman was running in the
baseline, as Fryman bunted pinch-runner Enrique Wilson to second,
with no one out in the 12th? Yes, he did, even though the crew
chief Jim Evans said Fryman was entitled to be where he was as he
hit first base.
</P>
<P>
   The replay showed that Fryman was never between the restraining
lines as he tried to beat Tino Martinez's throw from behind him.
The ball arrived as Fryman did, hit Fryman in the back, bounced 15
feet behind Knoblauch, who didn't even turn around to look for the
ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was a no-brainer,'' he would say, an unfortunate
choice of words from the man who amazingly stood in his tracks,
pointing at the baseline as Wilson and Fryman did what that
unofficial manual for every player, 8 and over, commands you to do:
Assume nothing, keep playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no idea where the ball was, to begin with,'' Knoblauch
explained lamely, failing to acknowledge that he didn't make any
attempt to locate it until it was too late. Had he retrieved the
ball even a couple of seconds faster, he would have thrown Wilson,
who stumbled between third and home, out at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   No excuses for not playing on, Torre agreed, after lobbing a few
verbal grenades at the umps. Martinez, given the error for his
throw, admitted the call could have gone either way and decided the
Yankees had no one to blame for the defeat but themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should have won the game much earlier,'' he said, citing
his own inability to deliver Paul O'Neill from third with one out
in the fourth. Speaking of wasted opportunities, Torre let David
Cone's favorite catcher, Joe Girardi, hit against a sidearming
right-hander, Steve Reed, with runners at second and third, two out
in the seventh, the Yankees having just tied the game at 1-1.
</P>
<P>
   As it was, Cone was gone by the ninth, when the Yankees had what
was their last chance to win, when Tim Raines singled and
pinch-runner Homer Bush stole second.
</P>
<P>
   Now, I am as excited by what Shane Spencer has done as the next
guy, but these are the playoffs and this isn't Joe DiMaggio. Rather
than send up a left-hander, Jorge Posada or Chili Davis, against
the right-handed Paul Shuey, Torre let Spencer swing away. He
struck out. Posada eventually hit for Girardi with Bush on second,
Scott Brosius on first. He grounded to second for an inning-ending
double play.
</P>
<P>
   The game moved toward its ungraceful finish. The Yankees find
themselves in a series after all, now returning to where they were
ousted last season, after a game Torre said he hoped was ``out of
character.'' Probably it was, but Martinez is in a horrible slump,
the table-setter Knoblauch has set himself up for everlasting
infamy, and the Indians flew home citing history, their own
111-victory team from 1954 that lost, four straight, in the World
Series.
</P>
<P>
   Stuff happens. Sound the alarms. The real playoffs have begun.

PLAYERS AND OWNERS FINALLY MEET AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Like two schoolchildren forced to reconcile in the
principal's office, the players and owners of the National
Basketball Association will try to bridge their differences
Thursday. In a bargaining session at a Manhattan hotel, they will
meet for the first time since Aug. 6.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the league nor the NBA Players Association expects to
make much headway toward the signing of a new labor agreement. Both
sides are pessimistic about starting the season by its scheduled
opening date of Nov. 3. But a dialogue Thursday about issues
relating to the owners' latest proposal to the players could result
in one smidgen of progress: a reason to meet again in the near
future.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Hunter, the union's executive director, said he would
respond to the proposal at the next meeting. The players soundly
criticized the document delivered by the league less than two weeks
ago.
</P>
<P>
   In its quest to put a ceiling on salaries and eventually install
a restricted salary cap, the owners have proposed phasing out the
Larry Bird exception, which allows teams to sign their own free
agents for whatever they want and represents the largest stumbling
block in negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The latest proposal also deals with the abolition of the
three-year rookie scale, which allows third-year players
unrestricted free agency after their third season with their team.
Teams would instead have the right of first refusal in the fourth
and fifth seasons, a proposal that would affect the 1995 draft
class and would include players such as Damon Stoudamire, Joe Smith
and Antonio McDyess.
</P>
<P>
   To slow the growth of salaries, the league has also proposed
rolling back the automatic 20 percent raises for multiyear deals to
7.5 percent for players who have the Bird exception, and 5 percent
for all other players.

ROGER VIVIER, 90, WHO RAISED HEELS TO NEW HEIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ENID NEMY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Roger Vivier, a leading shoe designer whose
innovations in heel and toe shapes changed the silhouette of
women's shoes, died on Friday at his home in Toulouse, France. He
was 90.
</P>
<P>
   Vivier created shoes for a number of the major French couture
designers, including Christian Dior, Yves Saint Laurent, Cristobal
Balenciaga, Emanuel Ungaro, Alix Gres, Andre Courreges and Nina
Ricci.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of illustrious women were devotees, among them Princess
Grace, Princess Margaret, Marella Agnelli, Elsa Martinelli,
Elizabeth Taylor, Josephine Baker and several members of the
Rothschild family.
</P>
<P>
   He designed the gold kidskin sandals worn by Queen Elizabeth at
her coronation and, for the duchess of Windsor, ``Black Magic,'' an
understated black velvet and satin evening slipper with a diamante
buckle.
</P>
<P>
   Many Vivier designs were extravagantly decorated, in kingfisher
feathers, seed pearls, rock crystal and coral. But no matter how
lavish the material, the design itself was almost always simple and
sleek. Heels were often the focal point of his designs. Some of the
most notable were the ``comma,'' in curved steel, developed with
aeronautical engineers, and the ``ball of diamonds,'' created for
Marlene Dietrich's stage engagements.
</P>
<P>
   In 1954, he introduced the stiletto heel, a towering sliver more
than 3 inches high. The ``choc,'' a high heel that curved inward
toward the toe, was introduced in 1959.
</P>
<P>
   Vivier was associated with Christian Dior from 1953 through
1963, and in 1955 the two introduced ``Christian Dior created by
Roger Vivier,'' the first ready-to-wear designer label shoes. After
Dior's death in 1957, Vivier began a long collaboration with Saint
Laurent; in 1965, he created for Saint Laurent the era's status
shoe, a pilgrim-buckle pump, with a square heel and a gold metal
buckle.
</P>
<P>
   Vivier began designing shoes in Paris in the 1930s, in a little
workshop on the Place Vendome, then relatively inexpensive. He had
studied sculpture at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts and then served an
apprenticeship at a shoe factory owned by a relative.
</P>
<P>
   Elsa Schiaparelli was the first couturier to recognize the
unique Vivier talent and in 1937 commissioned him to design shoes
for her collection. He moved to the United States in the late '30s
and soon entered into an association with Herman Delman, the
American designer.
</P>
<P>
   Their relationship continued until 1955, and was renewed for a
short period between 1992 and 1994 when Vivier shoes for Delman
were sold at prestigious stores, including Bergdorf Goodman and
Neiman Marcus.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Vivier was also involved in the retail business at various
times. His first shop opened in Paris in 1937, the same year his
designs for Schiaparelli gave him international exposure.
</P>
<P>
   He opened a salon across from Dior in 1963, managed by his
collaborator, the late Michel Brodsky, where a two-hour fitting for
one pair of shoes was not unusual. Ms. Dietrich, who lived nearby,
was reported to visit the shop almost every day.
</P>
<P>
   The boutique continued until the mid-'70s, when Vivier moved to
a castle in the Dordogne region of France and designed shoes for
the Japanese market. Another boutique opened on Madison Avenue in
the '80s and a shop in Paris in the mid-'90s.
</P>
<P>
   Vivier continued working at his craft until his death. Although
there was almost a decade when the Vivier name faded from the
forefront of fashion, a new generation of admirers emerged in 1985,
when an exhibition of his work was held in New York.
</P>
<P>
   There are collections of his shoes in the Costume Institute of
the Metropolitan Museum of Art and in both the Musee de la Mode et
du Costume and the Musee des Arts de la Mode in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his companion, Gerard Benoit-Vivier of Airoux,
France, whom he adopted.

ADVERTISING: GM BEGINS CAMPAIGN FOR CHEVROLET SILVERADO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich.)  (lb) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ General Motors Corp. plans to begin one of the largest
advertising campaigns ever in the auto industry on Thursday
evening, a $135 million effort to promote a complete redesign of
the company's best-selling vehicle, the full-sized Chevrolet
Silverado pickup truck.
</P>
<P>
   GM plans a barrage of network television commercials combined
with ads in 63 magazines and 339 papers and extensive direct-mail
solicitations to pickup owners, Chevrolet officials said Wednesday.
Orchestrated by Campbell-Ewald in Warren, Mich., a unit of
Interpublic Group of Cos., the technologically innovative campaign
emphasizes the greater size and power of the redesigned truck.
</P>
<P>
   According to Competitive Media Reporting, which tracks
advertising spending, the biggest auto brand campaign last year was
a $135.6 million effort for the redesigned Honda Accord, followed
by the Saturn division's $119.9 million spending. The biggest
campaign from 1994 through 1996 was a $131.3 million effort by
Saturn in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Success is critical for GM. The pickup produced 13 percent of
GM's North American sales last year, or $14 billion, making the
Chevy pickup a bigger business than Time-Warner, McDonald's,
Microsoft or Nike, said Kurt Ritter, the brand manager for the
Silverado.
</P>
<P>
   GM wants to win back some of the pickup-truck market share that
it has lost to Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. over the last
several years. But both companies have been preparing for months
for the introduction of the new Chevy pickup.

<P>
   Chrysler introduced new rebates on Tuesday on its full-sized
pickup trucks. James Holden, Chrysler's executive vice president
for sales and marketing, said Wednesday that this had partly been a
pre-emptive move aimed at the Chevy pickup.
</P>
<P>
   For all the advertising, Chevrolet's new pickup truck has one
feature that might prove a disadvantage. Its extended-cab version
has only three doors, one on the driver's side and two on the front
passenger's side, instead of the four doors that Ford and Dodge
have started to offer.
</P>
<P>
   Extra doors sell well these days _ when Ford introduced the
Windstar minivan two years ago with three doors while Dodge was
offering four, sales initially suffered, and Ford has since added a
fourth door.
</P>
<P>
   GM executives have already acknowledged that only putting three
doors on the extended-cab pickup may be a liability, and Ritter
said that Chevrolet planned to add a fourth door in the next model
year. Until then, he said, Chevrolet's marketing will emphasize
that the pickup has unusually wide doors.
</P>
<P>
   Chevy full-size pickups have held 28.5 percent of the market
through the first eight months of this year, a share that has
diminished in recent years as Dodge and Ford have moved faster to
update their models.
</P>
<P>
   The new Chevrolet ads use innovative techniques to present
familiar themes. Nowhere in sight are any families slinging
groceries or potted flowers into the bed, an approach that rival
automakers have tried in commercials and which reflects that 70
percent of full-sized pickups are now bought for personal use
instead of work.
</P>
<P>
   Chevrolet's commercials will be much more traditional, building
on the company's previous ``Like a Rock'' campaigns. The ads
reflect Chevrolet market research, which has found that
white-collar pickup buyers like the vehicle's blue-collar image.
The new ads use country music and scenes of industrial workers in
hard hats, and cowboys, but are presented with the latest computer
animation and trick photography.
</P>

<P>
   Chevrolet prepared two 60-second television ads, and then ran
the first 30 seconds of each ad repeatedly on television over the
summer, with the goal of creating public interest in the new
pickups. Beginning Thursday evening, the full-length ads will
appear, allowing viewers to see how each situation works out.
</P>
<P>
   One of the ads shows molten steel being poured in a foundry in
Gary, Ind., when the steel and sparks suddenly become suspended in
midair. The workers walk around in wonderment, looking at the
sparks, and then stroll out to the factory gate, where other
mechanical activity is also frozen. At the gate, they and a few
white-collar employees marvel at something off screen that captures
their attention as the 30-second version of the ad ends.
</P>
<P>
   In the continuation of the ad, the workers see the new Chevy
pickup, and activity resumes. William Ludwig, a vice chairman and
the chief creative officer of Campbell-Ewald, said that the molten
steel was a computer graphic created using some of the software
from the movie ``Dante's Peak,'' which was about a volcanic
eruption.
</P>
<P>
   The other ad shows a cowboy on horseback who is racing alongside
a herd of horses when suddenly his mount and all the horses become
frozen. The cowboy flies off his horse and rolls to a stop, and
then goes back and looks at his immobilized horse. He then heads
with other cowboys across a pasture before seeing something off
screen that transfixes all of them as the 30-second version ends.
</P>
<P>
   In the longer version, the cowboys then come across a Chevy
pickup and the herd of horses resumes galloping when the pickup
drives past it.
</P>
<P>
   Filming that ad required the use of many cameras taking pictures
of the mounted cowboy's horse from many angles at the same time, so
as to allow the cowboy to apparently walk around the frozen horse,
Ludwig said. The actor who played the cowboy had to do more than a
dozen back flips off a trampoline and into the dirt for the
commercial _ a painful but necessary exercise, Ludwig added.

U.S. TO REDUCE BUREAUCRACY IN RESPONDING TO TERRORISM 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JUDITH MILLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration is reorganizing its
structure for responding to a terrorist attack involving chemical
or biological weapons, acknowledging criticism from state and local
emergency service officials that its current arrangements are
``woefully fragmented,'' wasteful and confusing.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech Wednesday at a conference on countering poison gas
and germ warfare, Richard Clarke, the administration's national
coordinator for anti-terrorism programs, said that Attorney General
Janet Reno is completing the new structure, which she would
announce next week.
</P>
<P>
   While sidestepping most specific questions about the new
structure's details, Clarke outlined some of its features. He
disclosed, for instance, that it would provide what he called
``one-stop shopping'' for state and local officials seeking federal
aid in training and buying equipment to protect citizens from
biological or chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, he said, it would require that cities and states
produce their own emergency plans for response to attacks before
they receive federal money. It would also authorize centralized
federal purchasing of most of the equipment that states and
localities now buy individually to detect a chemical or biological
attack and much of the clothing they now buy to protect emergency
service personnel.
</P>
<P>
   With a congressional mandate, the administration has for almost
two years authorized federal training for local officials to help
them respond to attacks involving chemical, biological and other
weapons of mass destruction. Last year, the program authorized the
federal government to spend some $100 million to provide such
diagnostic equipment and to train local police, fire, public health
and other emergency officials in 120 cities. The cities receive
about $50,000 each to buy the training and equipment they want.
</P>
<P>
   From now on, Clarke said, ``we will not write checks and say,
`Go and buy whatever turns you on.'
</P>
<P>
   ``But before we spend a single dollar,'' Clarke added, ``we'll
figure out to whom local officials should turn'' in the event of a
biological or chemical emergency.
</P>
<P>
   Toward this end, Robert Blitzer, a senior official of the FBI,
told a congressional hearing last week that the Justice Department
would create a new National Domestic Preparedness Office to
coordinate the assistance and advice now offered by more than a
dozen federal agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Both Blitzer and Clarke emphasized their concerns about the
growing threat of biological and chemical terrorism to a conference
sponsored by Jane's Information Group, which sells information on
military topics, including chemical and biological terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Clarke also warned terrorist groups seeking to acquire weapons
of mass destruction that Washington was prepared to strike them
first.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States reserves for itself the right of
self-defense, and if that means our taking the first step, we will
do so,'' he said. ``We will not tolerate terrorist group
organizations acquiring or maintaining stockpiles of weapons of
mass destruction.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In an interview after his speech, Clarke emphasized that
countries that harbored such terrorists also risk becoming targets.
Pointing to the recent missile attacks against Sudan, Clarke said
the United States would ``definitely do something'' about such
countries. ``The something depends on what the circumstances are.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States, Clarke and Blitzer agreed, faces a growing
threat from chemical or germ-wielding terrorists. Blitzer said that
in 1997, the FBI opened 68 new investigations into the threatened
or actual use of chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear
materials. As of September, the FBI had opened more than 86 similar
investigations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is almost a one-to-one copy,'' Clarke told the
conference, between the State Department's list of countries that
sponsor terrorism and a secret CIA list of countries that have
chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   He praised Congress for approving most of the administration's
requests to transfer more than $300 million to federal programs
combating terrorism from other programs. But he criticized
legislators for failing to approve the $50 million requested to
improve the nation's public health system, which he described as
the key to detecting and identifying a biological weapons attack.

KINGS TRIM ROSTER TO 24
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Kings trimmed their roster to the regular-season limit of 24
on Wednesday, assigning injured defensemen Mark Visheau and
Jaroslav Modry to the Ice Dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Other Kings playing for the IHL team in Long Beach are goalie
Manny Legace, defenseman Jan Nemecek and forwards Jason Morgan and
Dan Bylsma. The Kings open the season Saturday in Edmonton. The Ice
Dogs open the season at 7:30 p.m. Friday against Houston at the
Long Beach Arena.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-6, 235-pound Visheau, 26, had one assist and 71
penalty minutes in five exhibition appearances with the Kings. He
suffered a thumb injury in a fight with the Mighty Ducks' Stu
Grimson last week and underwent surgery this week. He is expected
to be sidelined for about two months. Visheau played for Milwaukee
in the IHL last season.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-2, 219-pound Modry, 27, has played sporadically in the NHL
and spent last year with Utah in the IHL. He appeared in two
exhibition games before suffering a bruised thigh, and is listed as
week to week.

CLINTON'S AIDES AND GOP TRY TO RESOLVE BUDGET ISSUES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 7th &AMP; 8th grafs to add comments by Gingrich: polishing and
tightening throughout.)  (js) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With temporary financing of the government due to
expire at midnight on Friday, Republican leaders met Wednesday
night with White House officials in their first high-level effort
to resolve a dozen crucial spending issues and avoid a government
shutdown.
</P>
<P>
   The unresolved issues include financing for the International
Monetary Fund, how to conduct the 2000 census, and billions of
dollars in extra spending for items that the administration deems
emergencies, like the peacekeeping mission in Bosnia, the year 2000
computer bug, and disaster relief for farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Speaker Newt Gingrich, Sen. Trent Lott and Rep. Dick Armey, the
majority leader, were hashing out the details behind closed doors
in the speaker's office with Erskine Bowles, President Clinton's
chief of staff, John Podesta, the deputy chief of staff, and
Lawrence Stein, the administration's liaison with Congress.
</P>
<P>
   At a dinner break, Bowles expressed some confidence that both
sides could reach agreement but said they would be working all
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we made some reasonable progress, in general,'' he
said, adding, ``I think we've got a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said that no specific issues had been resolved and
suggested none would be until both sides could define the entire
scope of what they wanted. ``Nothing is resolved until everything
is resolved,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich later expressed a similar sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think there's a real chance if we stay focused we can slog
through this in the next three days,'' he told reporters at a
break. He said there were significant differences on a dozen major
items, which he did not specify.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't agree on anything tonight,'' the speaker said, ``but
at least we realize where the differences are.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Republican leaders were trying to smooth
over differences in their own ranks to speed the process along.
Over the squawking of both moderates and conservatives, House
leaders stripped out four controversial provisions from the
nettlesome bill that finances the Treasury Department and the U.S.
Postal Service.
</P>
<P>
   The four provisions would have weakened the Federal Election
Commission, required the government to provide health insurance
coverage for contraceptives for female federal workers, to block
amnesty for 40,000 Haitians living in the United States and to set
federal standards for child care.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, so many House members were so upset with these
provisions that they blocked the bill from being debated on the
House floor by a vote of 294-106. But Wednesday night, in a vote of
231-194 along almost strictly party lines, they approved the
procedures and paved the way toward passage on the floor.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., who had shepherded the contraceptive
measure through the House, was upset that Republican leaders simply
tossed it out in the final bill even though it had passed the full
House twice before and a similar measure had cleared the Senate
unanimously by voice vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican leaders should be ashamed of themselves,'' she
said. ``They have stomped all over democracy today in their rush to
kow-tow to their right wing.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a familiar theme among Democrats _ that the Republican
leaders are beholden to their conservative rank and file. But this
is increasingly not the case. As the legislative session hurtles
toward its conclusion, almost nothing from the conservative agenda
has advanced beyond symbolic votes on the House floor.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders have quite pointedly not held up the spending bills to
advance these causes, spurning conservatives equally with moderates
in the interests of reaching agreements and avoiding a government
shutdown so that they can keep the spotlight on impeachment
proceedings for Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   On the Senate side, Republicans were preparing for final passage
of the bill financing the Department of Veterans Affairs and the
Department of Housing and Urban Development. That would bring the
number of spending bills Congress has completed action on to six,
with seven remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those are expected to be wrapped into one big omnibus
package, perhaps by Saturday, although the negotiations with the
White House Wednesday evening could change everything.

   The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll of New York state is
based on telephone interviews conducted from Oct. 1 to Oct. 6 with
1,461 adults throughout the state. Of these, 1,066 said they were
registered to vote. Interviews were conducted in English or
Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   The sample of telephone exchanges called was randomly selected
by a computer from a complete list of 2,500 residential exchanges
across the state.
</P>
<P>
   Within each exchange, random digits were added to form a
telephone number, thus permitting access to both listed and
unlisted numbers. Within each household, one adult was designated
randomly to be the respondent for the survey.
</P>
<P>
   The results have been weighted to take account of household size
and number of phone lines into the residence, as well as to adjust
for variations relating to region, race, sex, age, Hispanic origin
and education.
</P>
<P>
   Results about registered voters' intended vote in November have
been weighted by the statewide distribution of ballots in recent
comparable elections from New York City (29 percent), its suburbs
(24 percent) and the rest of the state (47 percent).
</P>
<P>
   According to statistical theory, in 19 out of 20 cases, the
results based on such samples will differ by no more than 3
percentage points in either direction from what would have been
obtained by seeking out all adults in New York state.
</P>
<P>
   With smaller subgroups, the potential sampling error is larger.
For example, for results based only on residents of New York City,
it would be plus or minus 5 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of
conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources
of error into the poll. Differences in the wording and order of
questions, for instance, can lead to varying results.

NIKKEI SOARS AFTER JAPAN EDGES CLOSER TO A BANK BAILOUT
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: ADDS Thursday's midday Nikkei index in 4th graf, Encouraged
by ...) 
 (nk) 
 By SHERYL WuDUNN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The governing party edged closer Wednesday to injecting
massive amounts of money into the Japanese banking system, and that
prospect sent investors rushing into markets with greatly improved
hopes of an economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberal Democratic Party introduced legislation to enhance
the capital base of banks that are sound, but weakly capitalized.
The legislation, which would add to a bank-rescue package approved
last week, provides 10 trillion yen, or nearly $80 billion, in
taxpayers' money to recapitalize the Japanese banks, with an option
to provide more.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realized we should hurry, though it doesn't mean that we
can pass any bill no matter what its content,'' said Chikara
Sakaguchi, deputy head of the New Peace Party, a newly pivotal
player in the opposition group. That party and another small one
now seem close to pooling their votes with those of the Liberal
Democrats to support the measure, ensuring passage.
</P>
<P>
   Encouraged by the prospects of the Liberal Democrats' greater
influence, the benchmark Nikkei average of 225 shares soared 803.97
points, or 6.2 percent, to 13,825.61, with the index logging its
second-largest single-day gain of the year in a rally that helped
push markets higher throughout Asia. (At the midday break Thursday,
the Nikkei was down 3.32 percent, to 13,366.74.)
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, the stock market tumbled to its lowest level in
nearly 13 years. Over the weekend, Japan's financial leaders
painted a picture of gloom for American and foreign officials in
Washington. In one of his most outspoken remarks, Masaru Hayami,
the governor of the Bank of Japan, told Treasury Secretary Robert
Rubin that Japan's top banks are short of capital and that
taxpayers' money would be necessary to strengthen them.
</P>
<P>
   Hayami was criticized by Japanese bankers, including Satoru
Kiishi, head of the nation's banking association, who said that he
was ``deeply worried'' that the remarks could ``further erode
confidence'' in Japan's banking system. But many analysts say that
boosting the capital of the banking system is crucial to financial
stability and ultimately, economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``First and foremost, the policy priority is to recapitalize the
banking system,'' James Fiorillo, a banking analyst at ING Barings
in Tokyo, said. ``They can worry about the pure market principle
later.''
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts, politicians and bankers say that Hayami's
remarks, along with those by Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa,
appear to have been cleverly staged to inspire worry among the
opposition parties and force them to buckle to the demands of the
Liberal Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts also say that even if Hayami's remarks were scripted,
they may reflect a new sense of urgency among government and
central bank officials. Though the government has warned about the
severity of Japan's recession _ it now forecasts the economy will
shrink by 1.8 percent in the fiscal year ending March 1999 _
politicians bickered for months over what to do about it.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But last week, when the Nikkei average plunged below 13,000,
banking officials appear to have gotten nervous because of the
impact that lower stock prices have on the capital bases of
Japanese banks. As of the end of March, the most recent statistics
offered by the Bank of Japan, all Japanese banks technically met
the capital adequacy requirements set forth by the Bank for
International Settlements.
</P>
<P>
   Under Bank for International Settlements guidelines, the falling
stock prices did not have an impact on the Japanese banks, which
are still suitably capitalized. But that is reassuring only for
those who focus on accounting rules that permit the banks to value
stock portfolios at cost, and in reality the declining stock market
clearly meant that banks had less padding. That seems to be the
concern that Hayami tried to raise in Washington, and it is also of
concern to investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The markets were worried about bank failures, about a massive
banking crisis that would envelop all the banks and sink the
market,'' said Craig O. Chudler, a strategist at Salomon Smith
Barney in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the rebound was encouraging, but that government
officials might not do enough to make it last. ``They may be
preventing a meltdown, but they're not promoting growth,'' he said.

   NEW YORK _ The Yankees have prided themselves all year on not
taking anything for granted, for playing smart. But Wednesday,
their second baseman, Chuck Knoblauch, allowed a moment of stubborn
frustration to possess him and it cost the Yankees the tiebreaking
run in a 12-inning, 4-1 loss to Cleveland in Game 2 of the American
League Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees and Indians, tied at one game apiece in the
best-of-seven series, will play Game 3 Friday night in Cleveland.
The Yankees' Andy Pettitte will face the Indians' Bartolo Colon.
</P>
<P>
   The teams were tied at 1 before 57,128 at Yankee Stadium when
Jim Thome singled off Jeff Nelson to open the 12th inning; he was
replaced on the bases by pinch-runner Enrique Wilson. Travis Fryman
turned to bunt the runner to second and pushed a ball up the first
base line, where the Yankees' first baseman Tino Martinez fielded
it and threw toward first. Knoblauch was covering the bag.
</P>
<P>
   Fryman, however, was running inside the first base line, and
more important, outside the 3-foot lane that runs the final 45 feet
to first base. Batters are required to use that lane while going to
first, or risk being called out; it is a judgment call for the
umpire. Martinez's throw hit Fryman in the back and the ball rolled
behind first base.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch, sure that Fryman was guilty of interference and would
be called out, stood and pointed to the spot of the alleged
infraction, staring at home plate umpire Ted Hendry. And Knoblauch
stood. And he stood. And he stood.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, meanwhile, rounded second, then rounded third. By the
time Knoblauch finally retrieved the ball and threw home, Wilson
was across the plate with a dive, with the go-ahead run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no idea where the ball was to begin with,'' Knoblauch
said. ``I really expected the guy to be called out. It was so loud
and so crazy I didn't have any idea where the ball was. After a
little bit, I looked around and saw it back there.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he would do if he had to do it again, Knoblauch said:
``I couldn't do anything over again. I would have done the same
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The umpires' crew chief, Jim Evans, said: ``The base is in fair
territory. When you get near the base you're going to be in fair
territory. According to the home-plate umpire, Ted Hendry, the play
occurred right at the base. The fact that he was literally on the
base or right at the base when it hit him, he has a right to be in
that position.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans, who saw a replay of the play, said: ``I thought the call
could have gone either way. But I think it was the proper call in
that situation.''
</P>
<P>
   When the inning continued, Kenny Lofton eventually hit a two-run
single, increasing the Cleveland lead to 4-1. When Knoblauch was
introduced to bat in the Yankee 12th, he was booed lustily.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Knoblauch's play, Yankee owner George Steinbrenner
said: ``He should have chased the ball. A young man under fire _ I
understand. It's too bad this great game had to be decided on a
call like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the Yankees don't seem so invincible, tied in the
series, having missed numerous chances to push across the winning
run in the first nine innings; the Yankees went 1-for-12 with
runners in scoring position. Their 11-game winning streak, dating
to the last seven games of the regular season, is over.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland took the lead in the the fourth inning, on David
Justice's home run _ the first time in the Yankees' five postseason
games they had fallen behind. Three innings later, however, Scott
Brosius pulled a two-out double into the left field corner,
enabling Bernie Williams to amble home with the tying run.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees and Indians played into the eighth, each side
understanding that one run, one 360-foot journey around the bases,
could settle the outcome. One run would give the Yankees more
confidence, more reason to believe they cannot be beaten. One run
would give the Cleveland Indians reason to believe they can
overcome one of the greatest teams in the last half-century, as
they return home for Game 3, 4 and 5.
</P>
<P>
   With one freakish play in the Cleveland eighth, the Indians
suddenly seemed on the verge of scoring that one run. Omar Vizquel
reached out and fought off a pitch and looped a high pop down the
left field line; Shane Spencer, the left fielder, ran and ran and
ran and dove, but the ball just eluded him and bounced onto the
white foul line, bounding past Spencer and into the corner.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Spencer scrambled to his feet, retrieved the ball
and returned it to the infield, Vizquel was standing at third base,
with one out.
</P>
<P>
   Justice was coming to bat, four innings after he had launched
one of David Cone's curveballs over the right-center field wall for
Cleveland's run. Mel Stottlemyre, the Yankees' pitching coach, went
to the mound to discuss the options with Cone. They could walk
Justice intentionally and take their chances with the right-handed
slugger Manny Ramirez. Cone threw three straight balls to Justice,
and it figured they would walk him.
</P>
<P>
   But Cone flipped a curve for a strike, tried another _ and
Justice chopped the ball just in front of home plate. Joe Girardi,
the Yankees' catcher, pounced on the ball, looking back Vizquel at
third and throwing to first. Two out.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez came to the plate against a tiring Cone, who was 113
pitches deep into his day. With a 2-1 count, Cone tried a slider
that spun flatly; Ramirez turned and blasted it high and long and
far foul. Knowing he'd gotten lucky, Cone walked behind the mound,
unhappy. Girardi walked out to visit Cone, to review their options
on the 2-2 pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Cone threw again. Ramirez hit a soft grounder back to Cone, who
grabbed it and gingerly threw the ball to first, an egg toss. Three
outs. Cone took a step toward the dugout, planted his feet and
pumped a fist, like Tiger Woods sinking a 60-foot putt. The gallery
roared. The Yankees and Indians, both even par.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees had two out and two on in their eighth, before Tino
Martinez struck out. Tim Raines, leading off the ninth against
Cleveland's Paul Shuey, worked the count to 3-1 before hitting a
high chopper off home plate, sprinting on his 39-year-old legs,
beating the throw to the bag. Homer Bush, the Yankees' pinch-runner
deluxe, replaced Raines and stole second on the next pitch.
</P>
<P>
   But Spencer struck out, failing to advance Bush. Having seen
Brosius come through time and again in the playoffs, the Indians
elected to intentionally walk him and face Girardi. Jorge Posada
pinch-hit for Girardi and skipped a perfect double-play grounder to
second, ending the inning and forcing extra innings.
</P>
<P>
   To that point, the Yankees were 1-for-12 with runners in scoring
position, the Indians 0-for-3.
</P>
<P>
   Cone struggled in the early innings, lacking control of his
slider and trying to find a way through. This is when Cone is at
his best, said Girardi, when he must invent and improvise, a
pinstriped Houdini. Justice hit his home run in the fourth and then
Ramirez walked.
</P>
<P>
   Cone struck out Thome on an inside fastball, but Fryman singled.
Pitching carefully, Cone walked Brian Giles, loading the bases.
Sandy Alomar reached out and hit a hard smash toward the right side
of the infield, where Martinez knocked down the ball and flipped to
Cone covering first base for the third out.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Nagy shut out the Yankees for the first six innings,
allowing just three hits.

NAGY PUTS PAST FAILURES BEHIND HIM 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Cleveland Indians' ragtag pitching staff looks as
if it were composed of scraps that could be used for a quilt when
compared with the seamless group the New York Yankees have on call.
</P>
<P>
   And yet the Cleveland staff went pitch for pitch with the
Yankees and held the Indians together Wednesday in Game 2 of the
American League Championship Series. The pitchers did it just long
enough for a bizarre game-winning play to add another page to the
Cleveland's uncanny resilience in its playoff history as the
Indians took Game 2 by 4-1 in 12 innings at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   It was an unlikely finish in a game full of improbable heroes.
Charles Nagy was one of them. Of all pitchers who have tended to
put a twinkle in the eyes of the Yankees in the past, Nagy was the
starter who kept pace with the brilliance of the Yankees' starter,
David Cone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, I couldn't get the Yankees out to save my life,''
said Nagy, who entered the game with a career record of 7-8 and a
4.56 earned run average against them. In the 1997 division series
against the Yankees, Nagy started Game 3 and picked up the loss in
a 6-1 defeat. But he did not let the past haunt him Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   When he left the game, he figured that somehow the Cleveland
bullpen would stand up to the pressure. And the pressure was thick
for those called upon, from Steve Reed to Jim Poole, from Paul
Shuey to Paul Assenmacher to Dave Burba. And well after Yankee
manager Joe Torre had chosen to lean on his closer, Mariano Rivera,
in the ninth and 10th innings, Indians manager Mike Hargrove saved
his closer, Mike Jackson, to seal the game in the 12th.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tense in the pen,'' said Burba, who picked up the
victory although he pitched just one-third of an inning.
``Everybody wanted to be the guy who was called on next. So every
time the phone rang, you'd jump. It would ring again, and you'd
jump again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say I've ever pitched one-third of an inning and
picked up a win. This win was everyone's. Every guy who was called
on contributed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Indians' staff held the Yankees' glamorous bats to just 7
hits in 12 innings.
</P>
<P>
   In the seventh inning, with Scott Brosius on second base after
his double scored Bernie Williams to tie the score, Reed took over
for Nagy and got Joe Girardi to bounce out to the mound and end the
inning. In the eighth inning, with Derek Jeter in scoring position,
Shuey was able to strike out Tino Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time we found ourselves in a jam, we got out of it,''
Assenmacher said. ``The Yankees have an amazing lineup, and every
guy on their team can hit. We just held them off for as long as we
could.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tying the series is big for us. I'm sure the Yankees are still
the favorites. We're the underdogs, but to be going home for three
games, that's good for us.''
</P>
<P>
   To be in this position is nothing new for the Indians. Over the
past two years, they have lost the opening game of a playoff series
eight straight times. Losing Game 1 to the Yankees on Tuesday did
not faze them. It is almost as if they need the motivation to
strike back.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so in Game 2 Wednesday, there was much more gained than
just evening this series. A little mystique was rubbed off the
Yankees, and a little confidence spread over the Indians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thing is that we know we can win,'' Shuey said.
``If we have to come back here and play in Yankee Stadium, we know
the confidence is there. We won't be afraid. We found a way
today.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever it takes. Nagy watched the odd finish unfold from the
Cleveland locker room. With Enrique Wilson pinch-running at first
base, Travis Fryman put down a sacrifice bunt that led to a
calamity for the Yankees. They believed that Fryman, who was hit in
the back by Martinez's throw to first, ran out of the basepath and
was out. While Chuck Knoblauch argued, the ball sat on the ground
long enough for Wilson to score from home for the tie-breaking run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw Enrique running around third, and stumbling like he was
on TV bloopers,'' Nagy said. ``I was just hoping he didn't break
his nose, and that he could get up and score. I was like, come on,
come on.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we could hang around long enough, keep it close, good
things were bound to happen.''

WRIGHT GETS NO GUARANTEES

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jaret Wright, knocked out after two-thirds of an
inning against the Yankees in Game 1 on Tuesday night, may not get
another start in the American League Championship Series. Asked
whether Wright would pitch Game 5, Cleveland Manager Mike Hargrove
skirted the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not trying to dodge your question,'' Hargrove said
Wednesday, ``but I am going to. We have got some options. I think
that I have in consideration the fact that Jaret's last two
postseason starts have not been what I think he expects himself to
be or we would like to have seen. But I think we also have to
realize that he has got tremendous stuff. I will make the decision
as we get closer to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Hargrove could start Dave Burba or Chad Ogea instead of Wright
in Game 5. Burba pitched one-third of an inning and got the victory
in Wednesday night's game, and he also pitched well in relief in
the division series against Boston, replacing Dwight Gooden in the
first inning of Game 2 after Gooden was ejected. Ogea threw
effectively after relieving Wright on Tuesday night.

THE REAL CLAIBORNE WON'T BE HELD BACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If you've ever found the sweet spot on your tennis
racket or 3-wood, you know how USC middle linebacker Chris
Claiborne feels when he hits a ballcarrier. Thanks to Claiborne,
Florida State's Travis Minor and ASU's Ryan Healy have a pretty
good idea of what it's like to be a racket with broken strings or a
golf club with a cracked head.
</P>
<P>
   The human body, however refined, wasn't designed to absorb the
kind of pounding Claiborne delivers. Minor, the Seminoles'
tailback, had to be peeled from the turf two weeks ago after
Claiborne picked him up and chucked him like a roast in need of
tenderizing on a fourth-and-1 play at the USC 4-yard line. Last
week Healy, the Sun Devils' quarterback, had to be helped to the
sidelines after being smothered by Claiborne. Healy spent the rest
of the game trying to recover his senses.
</P>
<P>
   To encounter Claiborne off the field is to marvel at his
mellowness. Where in the name of Dick Butkus does he keep his mean
streak the other six days of the week?
</P>
<P>
   Sitting on a bench on the USC campus the other day, Claiborne
greeted passersby as though he were a pastor pressing flesh with
his congregation. When he's in street clothes, it doesn't seem at
all a stretch to imagine Claiborne once singing in the choir of the
St. James Church of God and Christ in Riverside.
</P>
<P>
   They may seem incongruous, the spiritual and savage sides of
Claiborne. But it's all explained quite succinctly in Exodus 21:
``eye for eye, tooth for tooth... burn for burn, wound for wound.''
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to spend as much time in the film room as
Claiborne does to see that it's a hurt-or-be-hurt world between the
hash marks. The book on Claiborne seems to be: You can't contain
him so try to cripple him.
</P>
<P>
   Every Saturday afternoon the 6-foot-3 junior sees more chops
than a butcher. The illegal block has become the crutch of
outmatched offensive linemen, the most recent of which was ASU
center Grey Ruegamer. Claiborne has grown so weary of having to
watch his knees, it's becoming increasingly hard for him to imagine
subjecting his body to another collegiate season of such
punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Think about it. If he's going to throw himself into harm's way
like that every week, why not get paid handsomely for it?
Claiborne's mother Millie is keen on seeing him earn his
undergraduate degree before heading to the NFL. But it's looking
more and more likely that his upper-level public policy classes are
what will wind up on the back burner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does become frustrating,'' Claiborne said of the
underhanded methods adopted by opponents. ``I'm not going to cry
about it. The (officials) don't call it so what can you do about
it? But yeah, it does make you think.''
</P>
<P>
   So must this: In August television football analyst Mel Kiper
Jr. scripted a mock 1999 NFL draft and slotted only nine players
ahead of Claiborne. And his stock has skyrocketed since then, his
reputation approaching full bloom as a result of all the flowery
praise he has received while amassing a team-high 45 tackles, four
sacks and two interceptions, one of which he returned 40 yards for
a score.
</P>
<P>
   After Claiborne did everything but set up a hammock in Florida
State's backfield on his way to 14 tackles, Seminoles head coach
Bobby Bowden said Claiborne impressed him more than did Ohio
State's Andy Katzenmoyer, whom FSU had faced in last season's Sugar
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Like Katzenmoyer, Claiborne has been a starter since his
freshman year. Unlike the Ohio State standout, Claiborne does
absolutely nothing to draw attention to himself off the playing
field. He'd sooner cut out his tongue and season and broil it for
you than unleash something like what ran from the mouth of
Katzenmoyer recently: ``Every 10 or 15 years, a new breed of
athlete comes along: bigger, faster, stronger. I see myself as a
new breed of athlete.''
</P>
<P>
   Claiborne looks like a prototype but in truth he's a throwback
to a time when players took pride in flexing the muscle between
their ears. Because he's as quick as wildfire and just as
aggressive, it's easy to overlook his mental dexterity. Even some
of his teammates are guilty as charged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before this year, I figured he just had so much talent, he
went on that,'' said junior David Gibson, who learned otherwise as
soon as he made the switch from safety to linebacker and started
sitting in on film sessions with Claiborne.
</P>
<P>
   ``He studies so much film,'' Gibson said. ``He has trained his
eyes to see the smallest things. He'll say, `Watch this lineman; if
he's leaning back (in his stance) that means he's going to pull.' A
lot of the things he points out, I probably never would have
noticed. I don't think people realize all the little things he does
to try to improve himself. He treats football like a job.''
</P>
<P>
   It figures to be, soon enough. But first, Claiborne has some
loose dreams to run down. There's a Rose Bowl appearance, which
escaped him by a year. Winning the Butkus Award also would be a
thrill. Then there's the fantasy that just won't flicker out, no
matter how hard head coach Paul Hackett tries to douse it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach,'' Claiborne will playfully plead during practice,
``Give me the ball (near) the goal line and let me run it in.''
</P>
<P>
   To which Hackett will reply in kind, ``Are you drunk?''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Hackett elaborated. ``I don't like that
idea,'' he said. ``Our chemistry is where I'd like it to be.''
</P>
<P>
   It helps make for a good mix when the team leader is as selfless
as Claiborne, who said that as much as he'd relish his five seconds
of fame at fullback, ``I can see where that would be frustrating
for a running back to carry the ball all the way down the field and
then have a linebacker run the ball in.''
</P>
<P>
   Imagine that: a star who watches his teammates' backs and not
just his own. Of all Claiborne's skills, that may be the one that
counts the most. &QL;

U.S. SAYS IT CAN TIE BIN LADEN TO EMBASSY BOMBINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Adds 400 wds. to bottom with details on bin Laden's organization
Al Qaeda and on the indictment.)  (js) 
 By BENJAMIN WEISER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Federal prosecutors in Manhattan said Wednesday that
one of the men accused of conspiring to bomb the U.S. Embassies in
Kenya and Tanzania in August had met earlier with Osama bin Laden,
the suspected mastermind of the attacks, and ``asked him for a
mission.''
</P>
<P>
   The reported meeting between bin Laden and the accused man,
Mohamed Rashed Daoud Al'Owhali, which had not previously been
described, is the strongest allegation offered so far to link bin
Laden to the attacks, in which more than 250 people died.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting, which prosecutors said took place in 1996, is
reported in a new 48-page indictment of Al-'Owhali and three others
that a federal grand jury in Manhattan returned Wednesday. It shows
how prosecutors are continuing to build the circumstantial case
that bin Laden, a Saudi businessman in exile, was behind the
embassy bombings and other attacks against Americans stationed
abroad in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors did not indicate bin Laden's response to the
offer; he is not charged in the new indictment.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment does not indicate whether prosecutors have any
evidence that bin Laden directly ordered the bombings, or whether
they may argue that he inspired a group of followers to carry out
the attacks. Bin Laden has called for attacks on U.S. and other
Western interests.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, in issuing the new charges against men suspected of
being bin Laden's associates, the government also declared more
concretely than previously that bin Laden has been a major backer
of terrorism groups worldwide. Its list of terrorist groups
includes Al Jihad in Egypt and the Islamic Group, which is led by
Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, who was convicted in 1996 in the plot to
blow up landmarks in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment asserted that bin Laden's organization, Al Qaeda,
worked on its own and through Al Jihad, Islamic Group and others,
which ``operated under its umbrella.''
</P>
<P>
   The authorities also gave their first account of what they
called bin Laden's network of businesses and front companies in
Sudan that he allegedly used to raise money to support terrorism
and to provide cover for the acquisition of explosives, weapons and
chemicals, and the travel of his associates.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment says bin Laden tried to recruit Americans to
assist Al Qaeda, particularly for traveling in Western countries to
deliver messages, to make financial transactions and to carry out
operations.
</P>
<P>
   One of those Americans, Wadih el-Hage, of Arlington, Texas, has
been charged with lying to investigators about his role in the bin
Laden group, and on Wednesday the charges against him were
broadened to include conspiracy to kill U.S. citizens.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to al-'Owhali and el-Hage, those charged Wednesday
in the conspiracy are Mohammed Saddiq Odeh, who is also in custody,
and Haroun Fazil, who is a fugitive. Excluding el-Hage, the men
were also charged with more than 200 counts of murder, one for each
of the bombing victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``Justice will be served for every one of those victims,'' said
Mary Jo White, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, el-Hage, who is being held without bond, sat
quietly as his lawyer complained in a brief hearing to Judge
Leonard Sand of U.S. District Court in Manhattan that his client
was being allowed only one phone call every 30 days. Sand asked an
assistant U.S. attorney who is prosecuting the case, Patrick
Fitzgerald, to look into the matter.
</P>
<P>
   In offering the most detailed assertions yet about the
operations of bin Laden and Al Qaeda, the indictment underscored
how the federal authorities are moving beyond the bombings in
Africa and focusing on Al Qaeda as if it were some kind of
organized crime family.
</P>
<P>
   The group, which bin Laden founded in 1989, is ``dedicated to
opposing non-Islamic governments with force and violence,'' the
indictment said.
</P>
<P>
   It grew out of an organization called Mekhtab al-Khidemat, which
means ``the Services Office,'' the indictment said, adding that
this group had offices in Afghanistan, Pakistan and the United
States. It said one U.S. site was the Alkifah Refugee Center in
Brooklyn, which raised money and recruited fighters for the
Afghans' war against the Soviet-backed government in the 1980s.
</P>

   Al Qaeda's members pledge allegiance to bin Laden, who was
considered the group's ``emir,'' the indictment said.
</P>
<P>
   To finance his operations, the indictment says that bin Laden
established several businesses in Sudan after establishing his
headquarters in Khartoum in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   It said these businesses included a holding company called Wadi
al Aqiq, a construction business known as al Themar al Mubaraka, an
investment company called Ladin International, an investment
company called Taba Investments, and a transportation company,
Qudarat Transport.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the authorities said, el-Hage moved from Sudan to
Nairobi, Kenya, where he set up a base for Al Qaeda's operations in
that country.

BIPARTISAN HOUSE REJECTS BROAD BILL ON PUBLIC LANDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs grafs 7, 8 &AMP; 9 to add comments from Clinton.)  
 (ATTN: Alaska, N.Y., Utah)  (af/js)

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ By an overwhelming bipartisan vote, the House of
Representatives Wednesday bowed to the objections of
environmentalists and the threat of a veto and rejected
wide-ranging legislation on parks and public lands in dozens of
states.
</P>
<P>
   The bill was an effort, in the closing days of the 105th
Congress, to combine scores of relatively minor and uncontroversial
proposals involving trails, parks and other public lands with a few
significant and hotly disputed changes in the management of big
tracts of wilderness and national forest. It was supported by House
Republican leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Among the provisions that the Clinton administration had opposed
was a proposal by the bill's main author, Rep. James Hansen,
R-Utah, to set aside for conservation the 630,000-acre San Rafael
Swell, the rugged canyonlands where the outlaw Butch Cassidy used
to hide out.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists also opposed it, saying it did not set aside
enough land for wilderness and did not provide strict-enough
protections.
</P>
<P>
   Other disputed provisions would have given the Chugach tribe in
Alaska easements to build a road over sensitive lands, and eased
logging and grazing on public lands that are susceptible to
wildfires.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's resounding defeat, by a vote of 123 to 302, was a
striking victory for environmental groups at a time when many
provisions they oppose are tucked away in spending bills that
Congress is considering this week.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech to the League of Conservation Voters, President
Clinton called the House action a sign that the Congress might
reject other proposals to roll back environmental protections, and
he vowed again to veto any spending bill that includes provisions
``that will do unacceptable harm to the environment.''
</P>
<P>
   He urged the group, a political action committee that endorses
candidates for office and contributes financially to campaigns, to
carry this message to the polls in November: ``We will not give in
to those who want to put the sacred up for sale.''
</P>
<P>
   In a significant shift in environmental policy, Clinton also
announced changes to the administration's proposals for nationwide
permits allowing construction in wetlands. The changes would
require full environmental studies for much development in
sensitive wetlands, especially those located in floodplains.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition came mainly from liberal Democrats and centrist
Republicans, although some conservative Republicans said they
opposed the bill because it did not go far enough to protect
private property owners.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Sherwood Boehlert, R-N.Y., who leads a bloc of the party's
pro-environment lawmakers, said the bill ``holds perfectly good
projects hostage so as to jam through Congress bad policies that
don't have a prayer of being adopted individually.''

EDITORIAL: A FUND-RAISING FRANKENSTEIN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va.)  (js) 
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, Oct. 8:
</P>
<P>
   Campaign fund-raising techniques seem to be getting worse by the
day. Unannounced presidential hopefuls for the year 2000 are
setting up political action groups that dodge through loopholes in
the law to solicit large donations from a small number of wealthy
supporters. Coupled with a new schedule of rapid-fire late winter
primaries, these new gambits are creating a perpetual presidential
campaign financed by political insiders, while the voting public's
role gets smaller and smaller.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia, which has lax laws on campaign finance, is becoming
for Republican presidential candidates what Delaware is to
corporations _ a safe haven for those who want to dodge regulation.
The Washington Post, in a recent article on Virginia political
action committees, showed that candidates like Dan Quayle and Lamar
Alexander are taking advantage of states with flimsy fund-raising
regulations and their own status as unannounced candidates to
create thinly disguised campaign committees that are unburdened by
any limits of federal laws. Using this new generation of tactics,
the pre-presidential candidates are raking in large contributions
from donors who have already given the $5,000 federal maximum,
financing ``issue'' ads that also happen to promote their
campaigns, and paying expenses of their unofficial but very active
races for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   However, when it comes to pure down-home outrage, the National
Republican Campaign Committee deserves special citation. Its latest
tactic is a Frankenstein's-monster-like mix of telephone sales
solicitations and those deceptive mailings that begin:
``Congratulations! You have won . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Callers saying they are from ``Speaker Newt Gingrich's office''
contact doctors and other professional people with the wonderful
news that they have been chosen to receive a leadership award and
serve as honorary chairman of a special committee being formed to
advise Gingrich on legislation. Anyone who has ever received a
computer-generated summons to Florida to pick up a large monetary
prize and view an interesting presentation on time-shares will not
be surprised to learn that Gingrich's ``spokesman'' follows up with
a pitch for a $500 to $1,000 donation to help elect more
Republicans this fall. The honorary chairmanship turns out to be
for a group made up entirely of honorary chairmen, and the
``speaker's office'' is actually a telemarketing company in Akron,
Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   The marketers may not have actually been breaking a federal law
that bans fund-raising calls from federal offices, but the fact
that they would pretend to be running their operation from the
office of the man third in line to the presidency shows an
appalling lack of judgment. The Republicans seem indifferent to
maintaining the appearance of working within legal limits.
