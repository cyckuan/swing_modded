   WASHINGTON _ The proposal that Yugoslav military officials
offered to NATO at talks in Macedonia was ``inconsistent'' with the
political agreement accepted last week by Yugoslavia and would not
guarantee the safe return of Albanian refugees, the Pentagon said
Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   After talks broke down in Macedonia, the chief Pentagon
spokesman, Kenneth Bacon, indicated that as far as Washington was
concerned, the sticking points included the timing of the Yugoslav
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the course of the discussions on the military-technical
agreement today the Yugoslav authorities presented a proposal on
sequencing that will not guarantee the safe return of the refugees
or the protection of all the people of Kosovo,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A broad agreement to settle the conflict over Kosovo had been
accepted last week after President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia
met with the Russian special envoy, Victor Chernomyrdin, and the
president of Finland, Martti Ahtisaari.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon said Sunday night that the proposal by Yugoslav military
commanders was ``inconsistent with the Ahtisaari-Chernomyrdin
agreement with Milosevic.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that in the meantime Washington would continue to work
with NATO allies and Russia to resolve the disagreements, but that
``the air campaign will continue.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, however, Clinton administration officials
indicated that the United States might be willing to agree to a
brief extension in the timetable for the withdrawal of Yugoslav
forces.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of Defense William Cohen and Gen. Henry Shelton,
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, indicated that Washington
would consider Yugoslavia's request for 10 days to pull out its
troops, rather than the seven demanded by NATO leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing on the ABC News program ``This Week,'' Cohen said the
extension requested by the Yugoslavs was ``not significant.'' Yet
he cautioned that ``what we have to be concerned about, is no
slow-rolling here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to allow a kind of deliberate policy of
delaying day by day,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On the same program, Shelton agreed that the three-day extension
requested by the Yugoslavs might be so insignificant that NATO
could accept it.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we in fact want to make sure that the extra time is for a
good reason,'' he said. ``We want to get the Kosovars back in as
soon as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   With the military plans stalled, NATO bombing of Yugoslav forces
in the field in Kosovo continued Sunday. The Pentagon said
warplanes hit an anti-aircraft site, 14 armored personnel carriers,
13 artillery pieces, a battalion-size staging area, five mortars
and several fixed positions, including ammunition dumps and
early-warning radar sites.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing campaign, which had shown such little promise of
achieving NATO's goals in its first few weeks, became far more
successful once the Yugoslav army was forced to come out into the
open to fight the Kosovo Liberation Army, Shelton and other
officials said Sunday. By cooperating with NATO's air armada, the
KLA in effect acted as the ground force that NATO itself had been
reluctant to insert into the battle.
</P>
<P>
   Once the Yugoslav forces massed to do battle with the KLA,
``that requires you to come out of hiding, move your tanks out and
get your artillery in position,'' Shelton noted. ``Whenever that
happens, needless to say, they make better targets.''
</P>
<P>
   Shelton and Cohen also echoed the sentiments of European
leaders, who again Sunday called for the prosecution of Milosevic
for war crimes. Milosevic is now indicted as a war criminal.
British Prime Minister Tony Blair said Sunday that Yugoslavia had
no future with Milosevic at the helm. ``It must be in the interests
of people in Serbia to have him go,'' he told BBC Television's
David Frost.
</P>
<P>
   NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana agreed. ``It's not NATO's
aim to depose Milosevic, it never has been, but I think all
citizens of good faith, not only in Europe but all over the world,
would like Milosevic to give up power in Serbia,'' he told the
Spanish television station Telecinco.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton was careful to note Sunday that the peace deal would not
require NATO forces to disarm the KLA, but only to ``demilitarize''
the rebel force.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never said that we're going to disarm the KLA,'' Shelton
said. He added that demilitarization means ``no longer having
organized units, getting rid of the uniforms, the heavy weapons,
things of this type. To our knowledge today, they (the KLA) still
intend to comply with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Russia's role in a Kosovo peacekeeping mission also
remained unclear Sunday. Russia, Yugoslavia's most important ally,
played a critical role in forcing Milosevic to accept a deal, but
Washington is now resisting Moscow's efforts to play a peacekeeping
role in Kosovo independent of NATO control. Cohen insisted Sunday
that the Russians would have to serve under a NATO-led command.
``Ultimately, NATO has to be in charge,'' Cohen noted.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton conceded Sunday that the situation was in such an
uncertain state that it was almost impossible to tell what kind of
conditions the NATO peacekeeping force will face inside Kosovo.
``Given the type of environment that they are going into, the
hazards will abound,'' Shelton said on CNN's ``Late Edition.

M'S ROOKIE ACE BACK ON TRACK, WINS SEVENTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Just above the Panda bear on the left field wall at
Qualcomm Stadium, there's an innovative scoreboard that the
Mariners considered for Safeco Field. All game long, it tracks the
number of pitches thrown, as well as the type and speed of the last
pitch.
</P>
<P>
   It's useful for fans, but the Mariners' decided not to use one
at their new ballpark because of concern it might distract the
pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   But not all distractions are bad. As he set down the Padres in
the early innings Sunday, Mariners starter Freddy Garcia noticed he
hadn't thrown many pitches. The Mariners had challenged Garcia to
go deeper in games after back-to-back outings in which he failed to
last six innings. The scoreboard told him he had a great chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw my pitches on the scoreboard, and I wanted to go seven
or eight innings,'' Garcia said. ``I thought that's what they
wanted, seven or eight innings. I figured I could go eight because
I hadn't thrown that many.''
</P>
<P>
   He did go eight innings, allowing one unearned run in a 4-1
Mariners win before 31,761 fans at the Q. The rookie right-hander
threw 123 pitches, more than he'd thrown in any start since his
third of the season, and said he considered the game his best so
far.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many pitches did he have? 123?'' said Mariners manager Lou
Piniella. ``That's what we like to see from him, that number, to
get us into the seventh or eighth inning.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia improved to 7-2, and contributed on offense, as well.
After the Mariners took a 2-1 lead in the seventh inning, Garcia
delivered a two-out single that scored Tom Lampkin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't worry about my hitting, because we play in the
American League,'' said Garcia, who nonetheless took considerable
pride in a double he hit in spring training. ``But, yeah, I like
hitting.''
</P>
<P>
   What impressed Lampkin more than Garcia's hit was the way he
worked the count against Padres ace Andy Ashby, who fell to 6-4
despite eight strong innings of his own. Ashby might have won if
not for Lampkin, who victimized him twice.
</P>
<P>
   In the third inning, Ashby tried to work a cutter inside and
left it too high. ``It was so bad, it about started to back up,''
Ashby said.
</P>
<P>
   That's what Lampkin saw, too. The Mariners catcher thought it
was a backdoor slider, and he slammed it over the wall in right
field for his third homer of the year, and first hit since May 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're playing every day, it's a lot easier to remember
what you've done right,'' said Lampkin, who was playing for the
first time in a week. ``It's a lot easier to remember it tomorrow
at 7:00 than next Sunday at 1:00. I need to let that feeling run
over and over in my mind so the next time I get an opportunity,
it's like the same old thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Lampkin came to bat again in the seventh, with the score tied
1-1. Raul Ibanez had reached on an error by third baseman Dave
Magadan, and advanced to second on a sacrifice bunt by Russ Davis.
Lampkin then scorched a ball to first base, where it exploded off
the dirt and bowled over first baseman John Vander Wal. It went for
a double, and brought in Ibanez with the go-ahead run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had it, and it was gone,'' said Vander Wal. ``I just stuck
my glove up in front of my face. I haven't seen (this infield) as
bad as it was today. It just seemed like every ground ball was on a
trampoline when it hit the dirt, just bouncing up. It gets scary
when you're playing the infield and the ball's jumping like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The infield has been fine at night, Vander Wal said, but
different Sunday with the sun baking it. Vander Wal's own grounder,
which eluded David Bell at second for a fourth-inning single, told
Bell to watch out.
</P>
<P>
   It was a valuable lesson. With a 3-1 lead, two outs and a runner
on second in the eighth, Bell snared a grounder by Magadan that
took a similarly nasty hop. He gathered it and threw to first to
end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no excuse to have a field in the major leagues that's
like that,'' said Bell. ``It's ridiculous. I'm happy I made the
plays. Maybe they can't control it, maybe it's something with the
ground or the sun, but it's just way too hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Way too hard is what San Diego seemed to be for the Mariners
this weekend. With five projected starters on the disabled list,
the last-place Padres used patchwork lineups this series.
</P>
<P>
   The average salary among Sunday's regulars was just $350,000.
</P>
<P>
   But San Diego used its three top starters this weekend and won
two of the three games.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners had won five straight series coming in, but they
knew road interleague games would be tough.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things that causes us problems against NL teams on
the road is that we don't really have a combination of hitters that
can put the game in motion that well,'' said Piniella, whose team
has won just five times in 19 games at NL parks the last three
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we hit home runs, we do all right. If not, we struggle.''
</P>
<P>
   But not always. The Mariners hit a pair of solo homers
yesterday, but they could have done without them. As the
conventional scoreboard showed, Garcia needed only two runs to win.

EDITORIAL: SILENCING CITIZENS IN EGYPT 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, June 7:
</P>
<P>
   The rise of citizens' organizations working for civil liberties,
environmental protection or religious freedom has given people an
important new way to monitor their governments and defend their
rights. Unfortunately, Egypt passed a law late last month that puts
nongovernmental organizations more firmly under state control and
allows the government to shut down any group it wishes. The law is
a leap backward for Egypt, the Arab world's most democratic nation.
It needs immediate repeal.
</P>
<P>
   The new law technically applies to all nongovernmental
organizations. But Egypt's intellectuals, who are outraged about
it, expect it will be most harshly applied to the two kinds of
groups long targeted by the government, peaceful Islamic groups and
human rights organizations. The law seems to be in part an angry
response to a report issued last year by the country's leading
human rights organization, which criticized police torture of
hundreds of villagers, including children, during a murder
investigation. The report, and the subsequent detention of two
members of the rights group, brought the government worldwide
condemnation.
</P>
<P>
   Egypt's old law on nongovernmental groups was restrictive, but
the new one is worse. It gives the government control over their
activities, the composition of their boards of directors and
whether they can get funds from overseas _ a financial lifeline for
many groups. The law is vague enough to bar any activity the
government considers political, and activists can go to prison for
violating the rules. Egyptian officials argue that anyone who wants
to engage in political activity can found a party. But for years
the government has rejected every citizen application to form a new
political party.
</P>
<P>
   A Clinton administration spokesman has called the new law ``the
wrong direction.'' Egypt's president, Hosni Mubarak, will be
visiting the United States shortly and should hear this from
President Clinton as well.

METS END THEIR LOSING STEAK, CLEMENS' AND JETER'S STREAKS AS WELL 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The hardest aspect of the New York Mets' turmoil,
manager Bobby Valentine said, was preparing for Sunday night's game
against Roger Clemens and the New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the Mets had spent 24 hours sorting through their
infinite personality conflicts, firing and hiring coaches and
assigning blame. Who had time to prepare?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe they needed a distraction. Maybe it was better if they
didn't think about Clemens, because the Mets battered Clemens and
the Yankees, 7-2, before 56,294 at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   With a single victory, the Mets ended Clemens' streak of 20
consecutive victories and their own string of eight consecutive
losses; avoided a sweep at the hands of the Yankees, whom they will
host at Shea in July; and finished a seasonlong streak compiled by
Derek Jeter. The Yankees' shortstop had reached base in every game
this season before going 0 for 4 Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets' Al Leiter, whose poor relationship with Bob Apodaca
reportedly was among the reasons for the dismissal of the pitching
coach, had the best outing of his generally terrible season. Staked
to a big lead early, Leiter (3-5) pitched seven strong innings.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first loss for Clemens (5-1) since May 29, 1998, when
he was pitching for the Toronto Blue Jays.
</P>
<P>
   Even in spring training, Clemens spoke of his tendency to let
adrenaline overcome him in the early innings, and of the importance
of harnessing his extra energy and using it to his advantage _ and
that's exactly what he seemed to be doing in the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   Throwing fastballs clocked from 94 to 96 mph, perhaps his best
hard stuff of the season, Clemens whiffed two of the first three
batters he faced and moved into ninth place on the all-time list of
strikeouts, passing Ferguson Jenkins (3,192 strikeouts).
</P>
<P>
   With his second pitch of the second inning, however, Clemens
threw a two-seam fastball low in the strike zone and Mike Piazza
hit it over the head of the center fielder Bernie Williams for a
double. Robin Ventura pulled a hanging off-speed pitch into right
field for a single, with Piazza stopping at third base.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody out, but hardly a dire situation for a power pitcher like
Clemens, who has the ability to get a strikeout or two and wriggle
his way out of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Going into Sunday night's game, opponents were batting just .220
with runners in scoring position against Clemens; last year, he
held opponents to a .176 average with 73 strikeouts in 233 at-bats
with runners in scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens needed an out, with Brian McRae and Bobby Bonilla coming
up, and then he would be in good shape.
</P>
<P>
   But that's when he started having trouble with John Shulock, the
home plate umpire.
</P>
<P>
   On a 2-2 count to McRae, Clemens aimed a fastball at the outside
corner and McRae took it. Clemens froze, anticipating a strikeout.
Shulock called it a ball, and Clemens began looking in at Shulock.
Two pitches later, Clemens walked McRae, loading the bases.
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla ambled to the plate, having gone hitless in his last 20
at-bats with runners in scoring position, batting .161. As a
low-ball hitter, he was susceptible to Clemens' high, hard stuff,
falling behind, 0-2.
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla took two balls to even the count before Clemens tried a
breaking ball, its trajectory a hump before thumping hip high into
the mitt of catcher Joe Girardi. Ball three, Shulock called,
prompting Clemens to stalk around the mound a bit, smirking some.
He threw another fastball to Bonilla, who pulled a liner down the
right-field line for a two-run double _ a fan reached out to touch
it.
</P>
<P>
   All that adrenaline Clemens is wary of appeared to get the best
of him thereafter, and his streak of 20 consecutive victories
quickly evaporated. After Clemens fell behind in the count, 3-1,
Benny Agbayani poked a broken bat single to right field and two
more runs scored.
</P>
<P>
   In the third John Olerud singled and Piazza smashed a two-run
homer and the Yankees' sweep _ a near certainty, it seemed, given
the Mets' turmoil and the fact that Clemens was pitching _ was not
to be.
</P>
<P>
   After a few more hits and another run, Clemens walked off, head
down, probably somewhat confused. He'd had such great stuff in the
first inning, and yet he lasted only 2 2/3 innings and was charged
with eight hits, two walks and seven runs, his earned run average
ballooning to 5.18.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter, ramming his cut fastball in on the hands of the Yankees'
hitters, allowed just two infield hits in the first four innings,
and faltered only once.
</P>
<P>
   Holding a 7-0 lead in the bottom of the fifth, Leiter walked two
batters and allowed a two-run double. But he retired Knoblauch and
Jeter, and the Mets cruised thereafter.  &QL;

BELCHER'S WORDS HAVE SOME KICK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Anaheim Angels pitcher Tim Belcher still didn't
want to talk to reporters Sunday about Saturday's fight with Los
Angeles Dodgers pitcher Chan Ho Park, explaining to an Angels
spokesperson he didn't want to let his feelings cause him to say
something he might regret. But as he did Saturday, Belcher released
a statement through the team:
</P>
<P>
   ``Regarding (Park's) comments that my tag was too aggressive and
my language too foul, I'll say this ... HANG WITH 'EM! That phrase,
hard tags and men cursing have been a part of our game forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``When players and teams fight, there are certain unwritten
rules of engagement. His adolescent exception was to attempt to
kick my face with his spikes. My reaction was self-defense and
justified.
</P>
<P>
   ``As to my bigger concern, I pitched one very poor inning and
lost the game. It is difficult to judge what effect the fight had
on my pitching. One thing is for certain, however, I tired quickly
in the sixth and made very poor pitches and a couple of poor
decisions. I should have gone after (Eric) Karros more than I did
and should have started (Devon) White with something soft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seeing Matt's (Walbeck) grand slam go for (naught) really
hurts me. Beyond that, I'm fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Angels manager Terry Collins said his biggest concern was that
everyone came away healthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hate to see that happen, especially in our situation,'' he
said. ``We can't afford to have anyone else hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins called Sunday's win big, considering the distractions of
the past few days. Besides the fight, there was clubhouse
dissension over Collins himself. A group of players met with
general manager Bill Bavasi last week to discuss concerns they had
with the way Collins manages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt walking around the clubhouse today that these guys were
ready to play,'' Collins said. ``One thing they realize is we've
all got the same name on our jerseys, every one of us. Regardless
of their feelings for each other or myself, they realize they have
to get the job done. Guys on the bench were patting each other on
the back ... it's a matter of moving past it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I never really lost focus, and I don't think the ballclub lost
focus,'' first baseman Mo Vaughn said. ``In this clubhouse it's
been very, very consistent in terms of what we want to do,
regardless of what's going on. The responsibility of how you play
is up to the players.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is another problem to overcome _ pitcher Omar Olivares
will miss his turn in the rotation Wednesday in San Francisco
because of a strained left hamstring. Olivares, who hurt the
hamstring trying to beat out an infield grounder Friday night, is
not expected to miss any other starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing we've got to do is make sure he's OK because he's
active on the mound,'' Collins said. ``He fields his position and
moves around a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Olivares agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's more of a worry for me,'' Olivares said. ``How's it
going to be if I have to run and cover first base?''
</P>
<P>
   Collins said he'd like to bring back Belcher on three days rest
to replace Olivares. Belcher made 81 pitches in Saturday's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to let him have (Sunday) off, kick back and see how he
is (today),'' Collins said. ``If I can help it, I don't want to use
a guy out of the bullpen. If Tim can do it, we'll try to get him
out there and cut his pitches down.''
</P>
<P>
   If Belcher can't do it, Collins' options include relievers Scott
Schoeneweis, Mark Petkovsek and Shigetoshi Hasegawa, with
Schoeneweis the favorite.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Most people are afraid of ghosts, but baseball people
cherish ghosts and the best players chase them.
</P>
<P>
   Only a year ago Mark McGwire, with 70 home runs, and Sammy Sosa,
with 66, caught and passed Roger Maris' ghost. And until Sunday
night, Roger Clemens of the Yankees had been chasing the ghost of
Carl Hubbell, whose 24-game winning streak for the New York Giants
in 1936 and 1937 is the major league record.
</P>
<P>
   But on Sunday night, the Mets, the descendants of those Giants,
stopped Clemens' streak at 20 victories, knocking him out in the
third inning of a 7-2 rout.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbell's ghost was the spiritual ``winning pitcher'' Sunday
night, but throughout their winning streaks, Clemens and Hubbell's
ghosts were always more different than alike.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens is right-handed, Hubbell was left-handed. Clemens
depends on his fastball, Hubbell thrived on his screwball. Clemens
seldom completes nine innings, Hubbell almost always did. Clemens
doesn't relieve, Hubbell occasionally did. In the space age,
Clemens' nickname is Rocket. In the Depression, Hubbell was known
as the Meal Ticket.
</P>
<P>
   But just as Clemens, a five-time Cy Young award winner with 237
career victories, is baseball's dominant pitcher of the last
decade, Hubbell was the dominant pitcher in his era, the legend
best remembered for striking out Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Jimmie
Foxx, Al Simmons and Joe Cronin in order in the 1934 all-star game
at the Polo Grounds in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbell finished the 1936 season with 16 straight victories,
then opened the 1937 season with eight more before being knocked
out in the fourth inning of a 10-3 loss to the Brooklyn Dodgers, in
the opener of a May 31 doubleheader at the Polo Grounds that
attracted 61,756.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants won the pennant each year, but lost both World Series
to the Yankees. Hubbell's 1-1 record in the 1936 Series did not
count in the streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never tried to set any records, or go for any kind of
record,'' the Hall of Famer once said of his streak. ``It just
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Hubbell had a 26-6 record with a 2.31 earned run average in
1936, a 22-8 record with a 3.20 ERA in 1937. Over his 16 seasons,
all with the Giants, he was 253-154 with a 2.97 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbell's streak was much more consistent than Clemens' streak,
much more compact. Hubbell needed only 27 games for his 24
victories, winning 21 of 22 starts, with 19 complete games and only
one no-decision; he picked up his other three victories in five
relief appearances.
</P>
<P>
   In Clemens' 30 starts during his streak, he had only five
complete games and 10 no-decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens twice was lucky to be taken off the hook by the Yankees
when he didn't pitch well. Early this season he was shelled for
seven runs in three-plus innings against Baltimore, then five runs
in two innings against Texas, but had no decision each time.
</P>
<P>
   When Clemens was shown a breakdown of Hubbell's streak, as
unearthed by the Elias Sports Bureau, he was impressed. ``Those 19
complete games, that's awesome,'' Clemens said. ``And didn't they
just have four starters in those days?''
</P>
<P>
   Pitching rotations were like that then; Hubbell usually started
with three days' rest, sometimes two or four. When Giants manager
Bill Terry needed a pitcher to lock up a victory, he occasionally
brought Hubbell in from the bullpen _ a role that Clemens has never
had with the Red Sox, the Blue Jays or the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I relieved maybe once in Boston,'' Clemens said. ``I
think I was coming back from something.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of expansion and interleague play, Clemens defeated 12
teams during his streak, including Detroit four times. In Hubbell's
era, there were only seven other National League teams. During his
streak, he had five victories over Cincinnati (two in relief); four
over St. Louis (one in relief), Chicago and Philadelphia; three
over Brooklyn and Pittsburgh; and one over the Boston Braves. He
outpitched Dizzy Dean of the Cardinals three times.
</P>
<P>
   ``What jumps out at me about Hubbell's streak are those 19
complete games,'' said Mel Stottlemyre, the Yankees' pitching
coach. ``Those complete games take it out of you _ 19 complete
games in 22 starts, that's incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   The current Yankees, for example, haven't had a complete game
since last Sept. 14 when Orlando `El Duque' Hernandez stopped the
Red Sox, 3-0, at Yankee Stadium. In today's baseball, complete
games are few and far between.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five and two-thirds,'' said Don Zimmer, the Yankees' bench
coach. ``That's now considered a quality start.''
</P>
<P>
   But for Roger Clemens the night his streak ended, two and
two-thirds innings can't even be considered a quality loss.

EDITORIAL: A MUCH BIGGER CENSUS BILL
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, June 7:
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau says it will cost $1.7 billion in addition to
the $2.9 billion already requested to comply with a Supreme Court
ruling that prohibits the use of statistical sampling for
apportioning congressional seats among the states. The new money is
needed to pay for 400,000 more census takers. Yet this expense may
not improve on census accuracy or solve the political problems of
the Republican Party, which opposes sampling.
</P>
<P>
   The 1990 Census missed 8.4 million people and double counted 4.4
million, with most of the undercount occurring in poor, urban and
minority communities. The factors that hindered accuracy in 1990 _
growing immigrant populations, increased mobility, irregular
housing patterns _ have all become more pronounced in the past
decade.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court decision allows sampling in determining
population for other purposes, like redrawing state and
congressional legislative districts. If state legislatures were to
use the more accurate, adjusted figures _ which the Census Bureau
will also produce _ redistricting might well result in more
Democratic districts. This is exactly what Republicans fear.
Republican lawmakers in several states have passed legislation to
require the use of unadjusted census figures for redistricting. The
politics may win out, but resisting scientific methods to reduce
the undercount is undemocratic.

COMMENTARY: WHEN THE SOUND OF A DIAL TONE IS OMINOUS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Leo Mondale has been working on the project for years, but he
still sounds a little awe-struck. ``This is quite a marvel,'' he
says. ``We do have truly global coverage. We can serve customers at
the poles, in the Himalayas, in the suburbs, wherever'' regular
cellular phones cannot.
</P>
<P>
   That vision, of the truly universal phone, is now reality.
Iridium, the company of which Mondale is chief financial officer,
proudly reported last month that a woman named Karla Wheelock had
used an Iridium satellite phone to call her mother in Mexico _ from
the top of Mount Everest.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the Everest market is not a very large one, at
least not when measured in terms of demand for telephone service.
Investors, who only a year ago were in love with Iridium, now
dismiss it as a failure. Its financial plans were based on having
at least 300,000 subscribers by now. It has about 10,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Iridium saga is not over. The company probably will come up
with the money it needs to keep operating, and it may yet garner
many more customers than it has. But its plight is merely one of
the most obvious indications of the fact that the past several
years have seen an explosion of investment in the
telecommunications industry. A plethora of companies are putting up
new wireless systems, installing trans-Atlantic cables, building
competitive local-access phone companies or installing domestic
long-distance systems.
</P>
<P>
   That investment reflects rapid expansion in the
telecommunications market as demand has soared for fax, cellular
and Internet services. Deregulation has made it possible to compete
with individual parts of the big phone companies' businesses.
</P>
<P>
   So far, most of those investments have panned out _ or at least
have not yet gone bad. Some of them have proved to be bonanzas,
usually because bigger companies have taken over smaller ones. But
Iridium is far from being the only one in trouble. Seven years ago,
there were almost no junk-bond issues from the telecommunications
industry. Now, they make up 15 percent of junk bonds outstanding _
and 20 percent of such bonds in default.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the new phone ventures have the same basic plan: invest
a lot of money building a system. Then, when it is up and running,
it becomes a money machine as customers pay for services that cost
little to provide once the infrastructure is in.
</P>
<P>
   The catch comes in getting enough money from the customers.
Already, prices for cellular service are falling as more and more
companies enter the market, and there are still a lot of systems
under construction. Iridium, whose phones connect to a network of
satellites in areas where cellular service is not available,
assumed customers would pay a premium over the old price of
cellular service. But the new cellular price is far lower, and
Iridium is clearly going to have to slash prices. It has brought in
a new chief executive and a new head of marketing. Mondale's
comments came at a meeting with analysts where he said the company
hoped to avoid filing for bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   There is a game of financial chicken going on now at Iridium,
with the various parties that invested in the company, including
banks, phone companies and Motorola, whose technology is being
used, trying to get others to put up the hundreds of millions
needed to keep it going. In the end, with billions already
invested, the money will probably be found. Customers will benefit
while investors and lenders take losses.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street views Iridium's problems as exceptional, and money
continues to pour into new telecommunications ventures. The
assumption seems to be that the explosion of data transmission
means there cannot be too much fiber-optic cable. That assumption
is likely to be proved wrong within a few years, with a glut that
drives down prices.
</P>
<P>
   When that happens, investors may remember that the history of
technology investing is littered with such periods, when expected
profits vanish due to overcapacity or obsolescence or both, and may
start to flee.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, a dial tone _ or, to be specific, the
availability of too many such tones _ could be the sound that ends
the investment boom in communications technology.

ALLIED SIGNAL AND HONEYWELL TO ANNOUNCE MERGER
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Minn., N.J., N.Y.)   (rk) 
 By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH and LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   As expected, Allied Signal Inc., the diversified manufacturer,
and Honeywell Inc., the Minneapolis-based maker of electronic
controls, will announce Monday that they will merge, in a stock
swap valued around $14 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The deal will create a company with $25 billion in annual sales
and a market capitalization in excess of $45 billion. The combined
company will be called Honeywell International, and will be based
in Morristown, N.J., Allied's current headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Under its terms, people close to the negotiations said,
Honeywell shareholders will receive Allied Signal stock valued at a
4.2 percent premium over their existing shares, based on Friday's
closing prices. Honeywell's shares surged by 9.5 percent on Friday
after reports of a possible deal circulated.
</P>
<P>
   The merger is expected to eliminate 4,500 jobs, with 2,000 of
those coming in the first six months after the deal is completed.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's expected announcement marks the culmination of three
months of secret talks between Lawrence A. Bossidy, Allied's
chairman, and Michael R. Bonsignore, Honeywell's chief executive.
According to people close to the talks, the two men met several
times in hotels in New York and Chicago _ and pretty much anyplace
except Minneapolis or Morristown, where their presence would
inevitably be noticed.
</P>
<P>
   Bonsignore and Bossidy had talked on and off about a merger for
several years, but had never come up with a deal that both thought
acceptable. People close to the talks intimated that Bonsignore
felt that Honeywell would lose more than it would gain from a
merger.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, Bossidy was still smarting from the failure of
his $10 billion hostile run at AMP Inc., the electrical-connector
company that merged with Tyco International last year. And, his
retirement, scheduled for April 2000, was looming without an
obvious successor in sight. So, a new spirit of compromise entered
the picture. ``This was the first time the talks got to this level
of detail,'' someone close to the process said.
</P>
<P>
   The deal they hammered out, in fact, represents major
compromises for both companies. After 114 years of calling
Minneapolis home, Honeywell must move its headquarters to
Morristown. And Allied will see its name disappear altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Honeywell brand name is known around the world, but there
is a real business advantage to being on the East Coast,'' a person
close to the talks said.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Bossidy will be chairman of the combined company, and
Bonsignore will be its chief executive. Bonsignore, 58, will add
the chairman's title when Bossidy retires. Robert D. Johnson,
currently president of Allied's aerospace group, and Giannantonio
Ferrari, Honeywell's president, will share the chief operating
officer's slot. Fred Poses, Allied's president, will leave the
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is leaving of his own choice, but there is no question he
had hoped to be the next chief executive,'' someone who knows Poses
said.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, the deal looks more like an acquisition than a
merger. In size, Honeywell, with 1998 revenue of $8.4 billion, is
dwarfed by Allied, which had revenue of $15.1 billion last year.
Bonsignore and Bossidy will be the only inside directors on the new
board, but eight of the outside directors now sit on Allied's
board, while only five will move over from Honeywell.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the deal, Honeywell shareholders will get
1.875 share of Allied Signal stock for each share of Honeywell they
own. Based on Friday's closing price, that would value each
Honeywell share at $109.45. Honeywell's stock soared $9.125 on
Friday, to $105. But Allied's shares dropped $2 to $58.375.
</P>
<P>
   The transaction, which will be accounted for as a pooling of
interests, will be tax-free to shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Still, from a strategic standpoint, it is a merger of equals.
The combined company will have huge businesses in aerospace and
chemical products, as well as smaller businesses in automotive
parts and building controls.
</P>
<P>
   Allied is already a big supplier of materials to chemical
companies; Honeywell is a major supplier of process controls to
those same customers. Allied is a leading supplier of safety
instruments to airlines, while Honeywell is a leader in cockpit
displays to aircraft manufacturers. By merging their aerospace
businesses, they will create a $10.5 billion business with
customers in both the plane manufacturing and airline world, which
operate on different business cycles.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, both executives have been emphasizing services over
tangible products in all their businesses. People close to the
companies say that Honeywell International hopes to derive half of
its revenue from repair operations and other services.
</P>
<P>
   A merger integration team, made up of executives from both
companies, is already trying to figure out the quickest way to
bring Honeywell people up to speed on Six Sigma, a complicated
statistical quality-control method that has radically reduced
product defects and administrative costs at Allied Signal.
</P>
<P>
   The team has also begun working out details for cutting a total
of $500 million in annual costs by 2002, people close to the talks
said. After the expected job cuts, the combined company will
eventually have a work force of about 120,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
   The job cuts may hit hardest in Minneapolis, where Honeywell
will maintain factory operations but will close its headquarters.
About 800 corporate employees will probably be let go there, people
close to Honeywell said.
</P>
<P>
   The company expects to reap additional savings through combined
research operations, taxes and the company-wide application of Six
Sigma. It also expects that its combined purchasing strength will
yield better prices from its suppliers. ``Together, they purchase
$10.2 billion a year, so purchasing is an easily recognizable
target for cost cuts,'' a person close to the talks said. Indeed,
by 2002 Honeywell International expects savings to add 32 cents to
earnings a share.
</P>
<P>
   The people close to the talks said the company's goals are to
increase per-share earnings by more than 15 percent a year, to
expand sales 8 to 10 percent a year, and to have $2 billion in free
cash flow by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Honeywell was advised by Bear Stearns and the law firm of
Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &AMP; Flom. Allied Signal was advised by
J.P. Morgan and the law firm of Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver &AMP;
Jacobson.

<TEXT>
<P>
   TIRANA _ Ten weeks of bombing by NATO, together with diplomatic
pressure from Russia, may at last be squeezing Serbia and its
leader, Slobodan Milosevic, into making large enough concessions to
end the war with the West over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   As The Economist went to press, it was unclear how conditional
was Milosevic's apparent acceptance of a peace plan jointly
concocted by the Russian and American envoys for Kosovo, Viktor
Chernomyrdin and Strobe Talbott, with Finland's president, Martti
Ahtisaari, helping out as the EU's mediator.
</P>
<P>
   Judging by the outrage which the news provoked among several
leading Serb nationalists and prickly Russian generals, Milosevic
may indeed be steeling himself to back down.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, it is too soon to assume that peace will definitely
break out. But, for the first time since the war began, hopes are
rising that it will.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest difficulty is still over the precise makeup of an
international peacekeeping force in Kosovo, presuming that
Milosevic has accepted that all but a symbolic handful of his
forces should withdraw.
</P>
<P>
   Before setting off for talks in Belgrade on June 2, Chernomyrdin
said that ``NATO will command the NATO force, Russia the Russian
forces'' in Kosovo in any peacekeeping deal.
</P>
<P>
   NATO instantly retorted that it would insist on a single force,
with its own soldiers forming the core _ but acknowledged there
could be ``various areas of command'' in different bits of the war
zone.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian's phraseology immediately fueled speculation about a
virtual partition of Kosovo. That is something which, at a pinch,
Milosevic has probably long contemplated as part of an exit
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   While diplomacy has been grinding on, NATO has been intensifying
its bombardment of the Serbs. Ironically, however, it has not been
a particularly bad week, militarily, for the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Their armor and artillery still look just about capable of
fending off the kamikaze-style attacks of the Kosovo Liberation
Army (KLA), even after enduring relentless aerial bombing and the
loss, according to NATO, of about 100 tanks.
</P>
<P>
   Such strategic facts must have been uppermost in the mind of
Milosevic, as he began parleying about a settlement with envoys
from Russia and the EU in midweek.
</P>
<P>
   Serbia's forces could not indefinitely go on absorbing
punishment at the rate NATO has recently been meting it out, with
up to 400 air attacks per day by bombers now swooping in from
Hungary and Turkey as well as from NATO bases in Italy. But nor, it
appeared, have Serb forces been reduced to the ruined shell that
would force Milosevic to sue for a humiliating peace.
</P>
<P>
   And NATO's campaign, as usual, has not been without its share of
blunders.
</P>
<P>
   In what NATO described as a ``very small, very slight incident''
on June 1, its aircraft mistakenly dropped at least seven bombs on
the Albanian side of the border, scattering television crews who
had been observing a furious battle between NATO-backed Albanian
fighters and Serb forces using multiple rocket launchers to defend
the strategic slopes of Mount Pastrik, just inside Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of days earlier, the alliance acknowledged that a bid
by the KLA to regain control of Kosovo's western highways had
failed. By June 2, NATO was describing the fighting as
inconclusive.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a breakthrough towards peace, the KLA will in any
case become increasingly awkward for the West, as well as the
Serbs, to handle.
</P>
<P>
   Hashim Thaci, the young KLA man who is the declared prime
minister of a provisional Kosovo government, instantly sniffed a
sellout when it emerged from the talks in Belgrade that Russian and
western peacekeeping forces might occupy different zones in the
province.
</P>
<P>
   On the ground, within and beyond Kosovo, the political reality
has already changed. The Kosovars, nearly all of whom have been
displaced from their homes by the Serbs since the province
descended into war, have become much more demanding.
</P>
<P>
   The semi-clandestine KLA has emerged as the only serious
fighting force of any kind in the Albanian-speaking world, which
embraces western Macedonia as well as Kosovo and Albania itself.
</P>
<P>
   Ibrahim Rugova, the pacifist who a year ago was reelected
president of the Kosovars in a semi-official poll, seems to be
losing fast to the guerrillas in a battle for ethnic-Albanian
hearts and minds.
</P>
<P>
   Rugova forfeited some credibility by spending the first few
weeks of the war under Serb ``protection'' and being seen on
television (apparently under duress) with Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   His only visit to the refugees in Macedonia was a hasty affair;
he has not even set foot in Albania, where he has feuds with
politicians at both ends of the spectrum. As for the KLA, it would
give him a frosty reception, unless he accepted its authority.
</P>
<P>
   Even Albania's ruling Socialists, who tend to come from the
country's Orthodox, Greek-oriented south, and have little natural
affinity for the Kosovars, are now forced to back the KLA.
</P>
<P>
   Partly because it has little choice, the government winks at the
flow of arms and soldiers from its own (virtually worthless) army
to the guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Blushi, the government's diplomatic point man, acknowledges
that the KLA's moral authority in the eyes of all Albanians has
soared as a result of its battle with the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   An ill-kept secret among the small army of foreign aid workers
which has descended on Albania (170 nongovernmental organizations,
as well as the U.N., are there) is that the KLA has become
entrenched in some of the camps where some 100,000 displaced
Kosovars are eking out an existence, and not just in border areas.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. denies evidence of guerrillas in the camps, but any
visitor to the Mullet camp south of Tirana comes across dozens of
uniformed fighters, not visibly armed but itching to go to the
front.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Albania's 3 million prewar residents could be forgiven
if they secretly fear that Kosovars will take over their country.
</P>
<P>
   Such worries will not unduly bother the West's negotiators as
they scent a weakening in Milosevic's resolve, however much he and
the Russians still insist on conditions that NATO will resist. But
at least, after the most taxing months in the alliance's history,
peace seems to beckon. &QL;

<P>
   The mind of Slobodan Milosevic has long been a Balkan enigma. He
is both cunning and naive. He is ruthless and bloodstained, yet has
generally shrunk from confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   He is paranoid about his own security and believes deeply that
Serbia and Serbs are victims of history, yet he has remorselessly
bullied Serbia's smaller neighbors and has brutally persecuted
minority groups within his own reach.
</P>
<P>
   He would like to compromise with NATO, yet his assault on the
Kosovars made it ever harder for the alliance to accommodate him.
</P>
<P>
   He is coldly calculating, yet his strategic blunders over the
years have led to the collapse of the Yugoslav federation (from six
republics down to two) and to the devastation of Serbia, the
country at its core.
</P>
<P>
   Is he a genius at manipulating people and preserving power, or
will he, in the end, go down merely as a crassly shortsighted
dictator who brought disaster on his people _ and on himself?
</P>
<P>
   The indictment leveled against him on May 27 by the U.N.'s
International War Crimes Tribunal must have rattled him.
Geographically and tactically, he is trapped.
</P>
<P>
   Until the indictment, he had been quietly preparing an escape
route, should things suddenly go awry. He has relied _ as a link to
the world outside _ on close friends in Greece, whom he has often
visited in Athens and Crete.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Milosevic's son, Marko, has been in South Africa,
making financial arrangements for the family.
</P>
<P>
   All that, it now seems, is academic. A semi-rogue state, such as
Belarus, even Russia itself, might offer Milosevic an exile's
haven. But a Minsk suburb cannot be his ideal for a gracious
retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Still, cornered as he is, Milosevic is nothing if not a
master-wriggler. His lingering hope, of course, was that quarrels
within NATO and the force of Russia's pro-Serb feelings (perhaps
even promises of Russian arms and men) would yet produce a
compromise that would, above all, leave him in power _ by letting
him tell his people that their sacrifices were not in vain.
</P>
<P>
   That would have required NATO to agree not just to uphold
Serbia's sovereignty over Kosovo, but also that some Serb forces
could stay there; that, if an international force came in, Russians
would be its mainstay; and that, at a pinch, the province might be
partitioned, even with only a small bit staying under Serb control.
</P>
<P>
   But if, as now seems more likely, Milosevic is preparing to back
down a lot further, could he survive?
</P>
<P>
   For a start, he is not much loved by his own people _ in times
of peace.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, street demonstrations nearly finished him off. He
probably has the solid support of only about a fifth of the voters.
</P>
<P>
   But the secret police and army, his family-connected network of
businessmen and cronies, who control much of the economy and suborn
enough politicians, and a slavishly deferential state-controlled
press all contrive to keep him going.
</P>
<P>
   The secret police are crucial. Two years ago, several of his
closest colleagues, including the then-interior minister, with whom
Milosevic had fallen out, met mysterious deaths.
</P>
<P>
   This year, a leading but insufficiently supportive newspaper
owner in Belgrade, Slavko Curuvija, was shot dead. One of the few
serious opposition politicians left, Zoran Djindjic, has had to
flee to Montenegro, Serbia's rebellious little partner in rump
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps even more important to Milosevic is his wife, Mira
Markovic. She is moody, vindictive, much ridiculed by Serbs at
large and, unlike her husband, who has no real ideology save the
pursuit of power, is a fierce Marxist who runs her own communist
party.
</P>
<P>
   She sees a world that will be dominated by Russia, China, India
and, yes, Serbia. She _ and he _ can surely not believe that that
dream can now come true. But at least the pair are determined still
to keep their battered country a family affair.
</P>
<P>
   In this they have the eager cooperation of their son and
daughter, both big in business. Nearly all state-owned monopolies,
including arms-making, are tied to the ruling inner circle.
</P>
<P>
   The shady world of communist big business was, after all, how
Milosevic got going. His first big job was running the communist
state's main gas-import company. Then he ran its biggest bank.
</P>
<P>
   Old communist apparatchiks-turned-tycoons, such as Russia's
envoy for Kosovo, Viktor Chernomyrdin, are the sort of people he
feels comfortable with. If the Russian gas magnate and former prime
minister said the game was up, Milosevic might well have listened. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   &UR; (225-OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 775) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But it is primitive nationalism, egged on by the self-deluding
myth of Serbs as perennial victims, that has become both
Milosevic's rescuer (when communism collapsed with the Soviet
Union) and his nemesis.
</P>
<P>
   It was a stirringly virulent nationalist speech he made in
Kosovo, in 1989, harking back to the Serb Prince Lazar's suicidally
brave battle against the Turks a mere six centuries ago, that saved
his leadership when the Serbian old guard looked in danger of
ejection. Now he may have become a victim of his own propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   Some say that Milosevic, at moments of desperation, may be
inspired by a ``Lazar complex'' _ a feeling that, if the worst
comes to the worst, he could bring the whole nation crashing
heroically down around him under the weight of NATO's bombs.
</P>
<P>
   There is certainly a darkly wretched streak in his background.
As a boy in Pozarevac, the north Serbian town where he was born 57
years ago, he was clever and competitive, running the school branch
of the Communist Youth League.
</P>
<P>
   Never popular, he was then scarred by a double tragedy when his
father, a Montenegrin schoolteacher who had wanted to be an
Orthodox priest, committed suicide; a few years later, his mother
killed herself too.

<P>
   But if there is a yen for self-destruction in Milosevic, he has

<TEXT>
<P>
   The mind of Slobodan Milosevic has long been a Balkan enigma. He
is both cunning and naive. He is ruthless and bloodstained, yet has
generally shrunk from confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   He is paranoid about his own security and believes deeply that
Serbia and Serbs are victims of history, yet he has remorselessly
bullied Serbia's smaller neighbors and has brutally persecuted
minority groups within his own reach.
</P>
<P>
   He would like to compromise with NATO, yet his assault on the
Kosovars made it ever harder for the alliance to accommodate him.
</P>
<P>
   He is coldly calculating, yet his strategic blunders over the
years have led to the collapse of the Yugoslav federation (from six
republics down to two) and to the devastation of Serbia, the
country at its core.
</P>
<P>
   Is he a genius at manipulating people and preserving power, or
will he, in the end, go down merely as a crassly shortsighted
dictator who brought disaster on his people _ and on himself?
</P>
<P>
   The indictment leveled against him on May 27 by the U.N.'s
International War Crimes Tribunal must have rattled him.
Geographically and tactically, he is trapped.
</P>
<P>
   Until the indictment, he had been quietly preparing an escape
route, should things suddenly go awry. He has relied _ as a link to
the world outside _ on close friends in Greece, whom he has often
visited in Athens and Crete.

<P>
   Their campaign message is brutal and simple: find the box
numbered 33 on the ballot paper _ the one that contains the yellow
and green symbol of the Golkar party _ and make sure you vote for
that.
</P>
<P>
   All across Indonesia's vast archipelago the party of
ex-President Suharto constantly rams the message home: on
television, on posters and by having its supporters chant it
relentlessly at political rallies.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a scent of change in the air. For the first time in
more than four decades, the ruling party is not guaranteed to win.
</P>
<P>
   When Indonesians go to the polls on June 7, they will have 47
other political parties to choose from. How they vote will decide
the future of the world's fourth-largest nation and possibly the
stability and prosperity of Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters from all sides have poured onto the streets, many in
carnival mood.
</P>
<P>
   Those backing the party of Megawati Sukarnoputri, the daughter
of Indonesia's first president, have brought the capital, Jakarta,
to a standstill with a sea of red banners, flags and painted
bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Those supporting Amien Rais, a popular Muslim leader, have
attempted to turn it blue with the colors of his National Mandate
Party.
</P>
<P>
   Such high spirits are in celebration not only of a free vote,
but also of the passing of the old order. But the jubilation is
premature and could prove dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   As Indonesia takes its first steps towards becoming the world's
third largest democracy, many hopes and expectations are bound to
be disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with the rioting and bloodshed that forced Suharto to
step down last May, the election could pass with relatively little
violence.
</P>
<P>
   It might also be reasonably clean. Mechanisms are in place to
protect against fraud, vote-buying and intimidation. But, despite
an army of overseas and local observers, ``money politics'' will
corrupt the result in some areas. By how much will be crucial.
</P>
<P>
   Their unduly optimistic expectations disappointed, some
opposition parties may feel they have been robbed of their chance
of power. Indonesia could once again descend into chaos.
</P>
<P>
   Assume, for the moment, that this does not happen and, after
some initial venting of resentment, the election result is
accepted. Indonesia will still face an uphill struggle to defend
its rookie democracy.
</P>
<P>
   First comes the messy process of building a government, probably
a coalition. With its money and organizational advantage, Golkar
will still be the force to be reckoned with.
</P>
<P>
   The three most popular opposition leaders, Megawati, Rais and
Abdurrahman Wahid, another Muslim leader, have been united only in
their desire to unseat Golkar. On most other issues, their
differences are huge.
</P>
<P>
   The squabbling and deal-making that are bound to follow will
confirm the complaint of many Indonesians that their new parties
offer few policies, only symbolism and rhetoric. That was to be
expected.
</P>
<P>
   During his 32 years of authoritarian rule, Suharto kept politics
as the preserve of an elite few. Nevertheless, new leaders and new
policies will emerge.
</P>
<P>
   In Indonesia's case, it is to be hoped that neither will widen
the country's religious and ethnic fault lines. That would tempt
intervention by another simmering group, the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   The army has agreed that its role in national politics should be
reduced, but it could still brush aside its own reformers and try
to ``save'' a faltering country with a coup. Again, assume the
best.
</P>
<P>
   There still remain the restive provinces. In East Timor, which
Indonesia invaded in 1975, a referendum is to be held in August on
an offer of autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   If, as expected, the offer is rejected, President B.J. Habibie,
Suharto's little-liked and handpicked successor, has said that East
Timor could instead be granted independence.
</P>
<P>
   But some opposition groups reject this: they do not want the
vote to take place at all, or want it delayed. They are banking on
a big enough change at the center that they can talk not only the
East Timorese around, but also separatist groups in other
provinces, such as Aceh and Irian Jaya.
</P>
<P>
   And amidst all this something has to be done to fix the economy.
Indonesia has been one of the biggest casualties of the region's
economic crisis, but at least the reforms required by the IMF are
broadly agreed upon.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Russia, capitalism does not have to be sold to
Indonesians. Nor are all of them victims of financial collapse: the
local economies in some outer islands, rich with exportable
resources, such as palm oil, have continued to grow throughout the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the changes have been wrenching, and are not
finished yet.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, although the June 7 elections are for the People's
Representative Assembly, the assembly will later provide most, but
not all, of the seats in Indonesia's highest legislative body, the
People's Consultative Assembly (MPR), whose job it will be to pick
Indonesia's next president.
</P>
<P>
   That election may not take place until November, and will also
involve MPR delegates from the army, the regions and different
sections of society.
</P>
<P>
   Such a long wait could itself cause trouble, especially if
Golkar is tempted to exploit it to tighten its political grip on
the presidency. It would be better to choose a new president
sooner, rather than later.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia's election marks only the beginning of a long journey.
As a democratic giant with a free press and a growing economy, home
to 200 million people, it would be a defining influence for the
better in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   That is a long way ahead. But things are moving in the right
direction. &QL;

   Those backing the party of Megawati Sukarnoputri, the daughter
of Indonesia's first president, have brought the capital, Jakarta,
to a standstill with a sea of red banners, flags and painted
bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Those supporting Amien Rais, a popular Muslim leader, have
attempted to turn it blue with the colors of his National Mandate
Party.
</P>
<P>
   Such high spirits are in celebration not only of a free vote,
but also of the passing of the old order. But the jubilation is
premature and could prove dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   As Indonesia takes its first steps towards becoming the world's
third largest democracy, many hopes and expectations are bound to
be disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with the rioting and bloodshed that forced Suharto to
step down last May, the election could pass with relatively little
violence.
</P>
<P>
   It might also be reasonably clean. Mechanisms are in place to
protect against fraud, vote-buying and intimidation. But, despite
an army of overseas and local observers, ``money politics'' will
corrupt the result in some areas. By how much will be crucial.
</P>
<P>
   Their unduly optimistic expectations disappointed, some
opposition parties may feel they have been robbed of their chance
of power. Indonesia could once again descend into chaos.
</P>
<P>
   Assume, for the moment, that this does not happen and, after
some initial venting of resentment, the election result is
accepted. Indonesia will still face an uphill struggle to defend
its rookie democracy.
</P>
<P>
   First comes the messy process of building a government, probably
a coalition. With its money and organizational advantage, Golkar
will still be the force to be reckoned with.
</P>
<P>
   The three most popular opposition leaders, Megawati, Rais and
Abdurrahman Wahid, another Muslim leader, have been united only in
their desire to unseat Golkar. On most other issues, their
differences are huge.
</P>
<P>
   The squabbling and deal-making that are bound to follow will
confirm the complaint of many Indonesians that their new parties
offer few policies, only symbolism and rhetoric. That was to be
expected.
</P>
<P>
   During his 32 years of authoritarian rule, Suharto kept politics
as the preserve of an elite few. Nevertheless, new leaders and new
policies will emerge.
</P>
<P>
   In Indonesia's case, it is to be hoped that neither will widen
the country's religious and ethnic fault lines. That would tempt
intervention by another simmering group, the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   The army has agreed that its role in national politics should be
reduced, but it could still brush aside its own reformers and try
to ``save'' a faltering country with a coup. Again, assume the
best.
</P>
<P>
   There still remain the restive provinces. In East Timor, which
Indonesia invaded in 1975, a referendum is to be held in August on
an offer of autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   If, as expected, the offer is rejected, President B.J. Habibie,
Suharto's little-liked and handpicked successor, has said that East
Timor could instead be granted independence.
</P>
<P>
   But some opposition groups reject this: they do not want the
vote to take place at all, or want it delayed. They are banking on
a big enough change at the center that they can talk not only the
East Timorese around, but also separatist groups in other
provinces, such as Aceh and Irian Jaya.
</P>
<P>
   And amidst all this something has to be done to fix the economy.
Indonesia has been one of the biggest casualties of the region's
economic crisis, but at least the reforms required by the IMF are
broadly agreed upon.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Russia, capitalism does not have to be sold to
Indonesians. Nor are all of them victims of financial collapse: the
local economies in some outer islands, rich with exportable
resources, such as palm oil, have continued to grow throughout the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the changes have been wrenching, and are not
finished yet.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, although the June 7 elections are for the People's
Representative Assembly, the assembly will later provide most, but
not all, of the seats in Indonesia's highest legislative body, the
People's Consultative Assembly (MPR), whose job it will be to pick
Indonesia's next president.
</P>
<P>
   That election may not take place until November, and will also
involve MPR delegates from the army, the regions and different
sections of society.
</P>
<P>
   Such a long wait could itself cause trouble, especially if
Golkar is tempted to exploit it to tighten its political grip on
the presidency. It would be better to choose a new president
sooner, rather than later.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia's election marks only the beginning of a long journey.
As a democratic giant with a free press and a growing economy, home
to 200 million people, it would be a defining influence for the
better in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   That is a long way ahead. But things are moving in the right
direction. &QL;

<P>
   IMRALI _ The trial of Abdullah Ocalan, leader of a 15-yearlong
Kurdish insurgency, offers Turkey a chance to show the world that
it can dispense justice freely and fairly.
</P>
<P>
   Ocalan is blamed for the deaths of some 30,000 people. He
certainly has a case to answer.
</P>
<P>
   Human Rights Watch, an American-based monitoring group that has
often castigated the Turkish state, says that Ocalan's outlawed
Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) ordered the killings of thousands of
unarmed civilians, most of them families of Kurds who have obeyed
the Turkish authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors want Ocalan to hang _ for treason, among other
things.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing in court for the first time on May 31 on an island
called Imrali in the Sea of Marmara, Ocalan came across as a man
desperate to save his life _ at any price.
</P>
<P>
   Standing in a bulletproof glass cubicle, Ocalan declared: ``I am
willing to serve the Turkish state so as to promote peace and
brotherhood between Turks and Kurds.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he could bring his men down from the mountains within
three months. But in order to do so his life must be spared, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   His fighters do not, however, sound ready to obey. On June 2, a
suicide bomber killed two Turkish soldiers in the southeast.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the PKK may already be viewing Ocalan as a traitor. So
far during the trial, he has refused to accuse Turkey's security
forces of abuses against the Kurds. And he told the court that he
had been neither mistreated nor tortured by his captors, echoing a
report issued after an impromptu visit in March by the European
Committee for the Prevention of Torture.
</P>
<P>
   One leading Kurdish human-rights activist said: ``We feel
betrayed, crushed. Ocalan no longer speaks for the Kurdish people.
He has no role left for solving the Kurdish issue.''
</P>
<P>
   If militant Kurds appear to be deserting him, Turkish
nationalists, who helped sweep the far-right National Action Party
towards power in a coalition government likely to be led by an old
leftist, Bulent Ecevit, are baying for his blood.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Action Party's slogans in its election campaign was
``Hang Apo,'' as Ocalan is known. He could well suffer that fate.
</P>
<P>
   There have been no executions in Turkey since 1984, partly
because the Turks have been hoping to join the EU, all of whose
governments are against the death penalty. But now that the Union
has pretty well slammed the door on Turkey's application, most
Turks say they no longer care what Europe thinks.
</P>
<P>
   Europeans' calls for a fair trial only make Turks all the more
indignant. They point out that Italy, whose prime minister, Massimo
D'Alema, has called for Ocalan's life to be spared, could itself
have put him on trial when he turned up in Rome last November after
his expulsion from Syria, which had long let him operate from its
territory.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey is also gleefully using the trial to indulge in a bout of
Greece-bashing. In Ocalan they have found a more than willing
partner. He agreed with prosecutors that his men had indeed got
arms and training in Greece, which strenuously denies it.
</P>
<P>
   Still, international human-rights groups have sharply criticized
Turkey over its handling of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``It stinks from top to bottom,'' said one westerner watching
the proceedings. They cite the presence of a military man on the
panel of judges.
</P>
<P>
   Ocalan's lawyers complain that they do not have free access to
their client, that meetings with him, which last usually no more
than an hour, are filmed, and that notes taken during them are
photocopied by prison officials.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the arguments Ocalan has made during his often rambling
and incoherent defense, there is one that many Turks, as well as
Kurds agree with: that the Kurdish issue will not be solved by
Ocalan's death.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the Turkish government now being assembled is willing to
meet at least some of the Kurds' demands, their rebellion (the
29th, some say, since the Turkish republic was founded 75 years
ago) will continue _ whoever leads it. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Glad to see the back of Benjamin Netanyahu, Palestinians are now
struck with the fear that Israel's new boss, Ehud Barak, may not be
entirely dissimilar to its old _ when it comes to dealing with
Jewish settlements in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   It is not that Barak has said anything to confirm this fear; it
is just that he has said nothing to dispel it.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Palestinian anger is still directed at the outgoing
Likud government, which has continued to lay new time bombs for the
new men.
</P>
<P>
   The first bomb was the decision to start building houses for the
Har Homa settlement in occupied East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The initial decision to create a settlement at this site brought
the Oslo peace process to a halt in March 1997 and the Palestinians
have long tried to make a building freeze a condition for
restarting talks.
</P>
<P>
   Second, came the construction of new Jewish houses at the heart
of Ras al Amud, a densely populated Palestinian village in East
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   But by far the most dangerous move came last week with the
announcement that Israel's outgoing defense minister, Moshe Arens,
had approved plans to enlarge Maale Adumim, a Jewish settlement in
the West Bank, by some 13,000 dunums (about 1,700 hectares or 4,200
acres).
</P>
<P>
   Situated between Jerusalem and Jericho, Maale Adumim is already
the largest settlement in the occupied territories, with around
24,000 residents.
</P>
<P>
   Should Arens's plans be implemented, it would make Maale
Adumim's municipal area larger than Tel Aviv's and effectively
extend Jerusalem's borders so far eastwards that it would split the
West Bank into two halves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not so much a provocation,'' commented Nabil Amer, one
of Yasser Arafat's ministers, ``as a declaration of war.''
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians have appealed to the Americans, the European Union
and the new Israeli leaders to have the order rescinded. They have
received some succour.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans have criticized Arens's decision, as have members
of Barak's One Israel party and several Israeli left-wingers.
</P>
<P>
   But from the prime-minister-elect himself the Palestinians have
heard not a word, save that he``will not be dealing with diplomatic
issues until he has completed the task of setting up his
government.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak's silence would be more digestible were Palestinians not
also alarmed by the character his government appears to be
adopting.
</P>
<P>
   In pursuit of a ``grand coalition,'' his party is wooing Likud
and the pro-settler National Religious Party, amid rumors that
Barak has promised not ``to dry up'' the settlements and will honor
all decisions on expansion taken by the last government prior to
its fall in December 1998, including, presumably, the decision to
build Har Homa.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a semiofficial conference in Ramallah pledged a
series of protests against Jewish settlement. These started with
``a day of rage'' on June 3, at which one Palestinian was killed,
and several injured, by Israeli troops.
</P>
<P>
   There is more than a trace of fear behind the Palestinian
Authority's support for such demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   For the past six months, Arafat has not only ruthlessly cracked
down on his Islamist opponents. He has also kept a lid on the
simmering discontent within his own Fatah movement by persuading
them that nothing should be done that would hinder the replacement
of Israel's ``anti-peace'' government with a ``pro-peace'' one.
</P>
<P>
   This was essentially the argument that won the day in April,
when the Palestinians reluctantly agreed to defer any unilateral
declaration of Palestinian statehood until after the Israeli
elections.
</P>
<P>
   But now those elections have come and gone, Barak is riding
high, settlements are being built and Arafat is looking like a man
with nothing in his pockets except his hands.
</P>
<P>
   Local Fatah leaders sound increasingly threatening. Arafat's men
are as concerned to keep their control of Fatah as to stop the
settlement expansion. When senior negotiators, such as Saeb Erekat,
plead with Israel's new men, their words have the ring of
sincerity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Barak must say something openly about the settlements,''
says Erekat. ``The choice is his, but it's either peace or
settlements. We can no longer have both.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Glad to see the back of Benjamin Netanyahu, Palestinians are now
struck with the fear that Israel's new boss, Ehud Barak, may not be
entirely dissimilar to its old _ when it comes to dealing with
Jewish settlements in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   It is not that Barak has said anything to confirm this fear; it
is just that he has said nothing to dispel it.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Palestinian anger is still directed at the outgoing
Likud government, which has continued to lay new time bombs for the
new men.
</P>
<P>
   The first bomb was the decision to start building houses for the
Har Homa settlement in occupied East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The initial decision to create a settlement at this site brought
the Oslo peace process to a halt in March 1997 and the Palestinians
have long tried to make a building freeze a condition for
restarting talks.
</P>
<P>
   Second, came the construction of new Jewish houses at the heart
of Ras al Amud, a densely populated Palestinian village in East
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   But by far the most dangerous move came last week with the
announcement that Israel's outgoing defense minister, Moshe Arens,
had approved plans to enlarge Maale Adumim, a Jewish settlement in
the West Bank, by some 13,000 dunums (about 1,700 hectares or 4,200
acres).
</P>
<P>
   Situated between Jerusalem and Jericho, Maale Adumim is already
the largest settlement in the occupied territories, with around
24,000 residents.
</P>
<P>
   Should Arens's plans be implemented, it would make Maale
Adumim's municipal area larger than Tel Aviv's and effectively
extend Jerusalem's borders so far eastwards that it would split the
West Bank into two halves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not so much a provocation,'' commented Nabil Amer, one
of Yasser Arafat's ministers, ``as a declaration of war.''
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians have appealed to the Americans, the European Union
and the new Israeli leaders to have the order rescinded. They have
received some succour.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans have criticized Arens's decision, as have members
of Barak's One Israel party and several Israeli left-wingers.
</P>
<P>
   But from the prime-minister-elect himself the Palestinians have
heard not a word, save that he``will not be dealing with diplomatic
issues until he has completed the task of setting up his
government.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak's silence would be more digestible were Palestinians not
also alarmed by the character his government appears to be
adopting.
</P>
<P>
   In pursuit of a ``grand coalition,'' his party is wooing Likud
and the pro-settler National Religious Party, amid rumors that
Barak has promised not ``to dry up'' the settlements and will honor
all decisions on expansion taken by the last government prior to
its fall in December 1998, including, presumably, the decision to
build Har Homa.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a semiofficial conference in Ramallah pledged a
series of protests against Jewish settlement. These started with
``a day of rage'' on June 3, at which one Palestinian was killed,
and several injured, by Israeli troops.
</P>
<P>
   There is more than a trace of fear behind the Palestinian
Authority's support for such demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   For the past six months, Arafat has not only ruthlessly cracked
down on his Islamist opponents. He has also kept a lid on the
simmering discontent within his own Fatah movement by persuading
them that nothing should be done that would hinder the replacement
of Israel's ``anti-peace'' government with a ``pro-peace'' one.
</P>
<P>
   This was essentially the argument that won the day in April,
when the Palestinians reluctantly agreed to defer any unilateral
declaration of Palestinian statehood until after the Israeli
elections.
</P>
<P>
   But now those elections have come and gone, Barak is riding
high, settlements are being built and Arafat is looking like a man
with nothing in his pockets except his hands.
</P>
<P>
   Local Fatah leaders sound increasingly threatening. Arafat's men
are as concerned to keep their control of Fatah as to stop the
settlement expansion. When senior negotiators, such as Saeb Erekat,
plead with Israel's new men, their words have the ring of
sincerity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Barak must say something openly about the settlements,''
says Erekat. ``The choice is his, but it's either peace or
settlements. We can no longer have both.'' &QL;

<P>
   CHICAGO _ Wall Street may be where mathematics whizzes design
innovative financial products, but there is no lack of creativity
at the other end of the credit spectrum: lending to America's
``sub-prime market.''
</P>
<P>
   One new tool for putting cash in the wallets of
credit-challenged Americans is the ``payday loan.''
</P>
<P>
   Payday lenders typically offer a small amount of cash, from $100
to $300, in exchange for a personal check which is held, but not
deposited, for a short period of time (typically until payday).
</P>
<P>
   At the appointed day, the lender can deposit the check, return
it to the borrower in exchange for cash, or accept a fee to roll
the principal over into a new loan.
</P>
<P>
   Payday lenders do not require credit checks or collateral; they
demand only an active checking account and proof of a regular
source of income.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, they take their fee: 15-25 percent of the face
value of the check.
</P>
<P>
   When the interest rates on such loans are converted to an annual
percentage rate (APR), the numbers are staggering; a Chicago
Sun-Times survey of Illinois payday loan shops found the average
APR to be 569 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Many low- and middle-income Americans appear to have an
insatiable demand for quick cash, even at that price. The number of
payday lenders in Indiana jumped from 11 in 1995 to 59 in 1997 with
the volume of loans climbing from roughly $13 million to $98
million.
</P>
<P>
   Check Into Cash, a Tennessee-based payday lending company,
opened its first store in 1993 and now operates a chain of 432
stores in 16 states, including more than 30 in Illinois. Last
autumn, the company made a preliminary filing with the SEC to offer
shares to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Payday loans have caused an uproar among advocates for the poor.
The Consumer Federation of America calls the practice ``legal
loan-sharking.''
</P>
<P>
   The pay-day industry stands accused of preying on the poor while
making extortionate profits and misleading borrowers about the true
cost of their loans. Payday opponents offer anecdotal stories of
customers overwhelmed by mounting debt, such as the borrower who
rolled over loans 24 times in 15 months, borrowing a total of $400
yet paying back $1,364 and still left owing $248.
</P>
<P>
   But the true social cost of payday lending is more ambiguous.
For someone who is truly hard up, the only thing worse than
borrowing $200 at 600 percent APR may be not borrowing $200 at all.
</P>
<P>
   In a study of poor Chicago households, Susan Mayer, a professor
at the University of Chicago, found that the ability to borrow $500
significantly lessened the probability that the household would
suffer a ``spell of hardship,'' such as not having enough money for
food.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Check Into Cash argues that its customers are neither
poor nor exploited. The average customer earns over $34,000 a year
and has been at his or her current job for nearly four years; 36
percent of customers own their own homes.
</P>
<P>
   The company's growth strategy is based on attracting the middle
class with new shops in malls and suburban supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   According to focus-group studies, payday customers are most
likely to use the cash for car and home repairs, Christmas
shopping, and school expenses, although inevitably some also use
the money to go on vacation.
</P>
<P>
   A significant portion of the respondents said that, if they had
not had access to a payday loan, they would have borrowed money
from friends or family, a choice which they describe as humiliating
and stressful.
</P>
<P>
   Industry representatives complain that using an annual
percentage-rate to evaluate the cost of a one- or two-week loan is
misleading. They compare payday loans to a taxi cab, which is
cost-effective for short distances but probably not the best way to
travel from New York to San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The more interesting question is whether such companies are
making excessive profits. John Caskey, a professor at Swarthmore
College in Pennsylvania who has long studied the ``alternative
financial sector,'' reckons that sub-prime lenders charge high
rates primarily because their transactions are small and the risk
of bad checks is high.
</P>
<P>
   Caskey has found that borrowers have little understanding of APR
but do appreciate that payday borrowing is an expensive form of
credit. Rather, the part of the transaction most prone to abuse is
collections.
</P>
<P>
   Some payday lenders reportedly threaten to use the criminal
justice system to prosecute delinquent borrowers for writing bad
checks, a crime that carries a jail sentence in many states.
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen states prohibit payday lending outright, usually as the
result of longstanding usury laws.
</P>
<P>
   The industry is working hard to roll back such statutes even
while consumer advocates argue that more regulation is needed, not
less. In fact, borrowers and lenders have usually found a way
around most restrictive laws.
</P>
<P>
   A more fruitful strategy may be to discover why Americans of all
income levels tend to spend more than they earn. A recent consumer
survey found that 55 percent of Americans occasionally lack the
funds to pay all their bills.
</P>
<P>
   And despite a booming economy, the number of Americans filing
for personal bankruptcy rose 73 percent between 1994 and 1997. &QL;

percentage-rate to evaluate the cost of a one- or two-week loan is
misleading. They compare payday loans to a taxi cab, which is
cost-effective for short distances but probably not the best way to
travel from New York to San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The more interesting question is whether such companies are
making excessive profits. John Caskey, a professor at Swarthmore
College in Pennsylvania who has long studied the ``alternative
financial sector,'' reckons that sub-prime lenders charge high
rates primarily because their transactions are small and the risk
of bad checks is high.
</P>
<P>
   Caskey has found that borrowers have little understanding of APR
but do appreciate that payday borrowing is an expensive form of
credit. Rather, the part of the transaction most prone to abuse is
collections.
</P>
<P>
   Some payday lenders reportedly threaten to use the criminal
justice system to prosecute delinquent borrowers for writing bad
checks, a crime that carries a jail sentence in many states.
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen states prohibit payday lending outright, usually as the
result of longstanding usury laws.
</P>
<P>
   The industry is working hard to roll back such statutes even
while consumer advocates argue that more regulation is needed, not
less. In fact, borrowers and lenders have usually found a way
around most restrictive laws.
</P>
<P>
   A more fruitful strategy may be to discover why Americans of all
income levels tend to spend more than they earn. A recent consumer
survey found that 55 percent of Americans occasionally lack the
funds to pay all their bills.
</P>
<P>
   And despite a booming economy, the number of Americans filing
for personal bankruptcy rose 73 percent between 1994 and 1997. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Victory in Kosovo is being celebrated Sunday morning. The deal
struck with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic will end the
bombing and allow the process of rebuilding to begin.
</P>
<P>
   After 74 days of war we are back where we were at the beginning
of March: at the negotiating table. That is good. This newspaper
applauds both Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari and Russian envoy
Viktor Chernomyrdin for their work as go-betweens.
</P>
<P>
   But the war isn't over yet. NATO has created a desert, and it
would be unwise to call it peace.
</P>
<P>
   It would also be unwise to talk of victory. For who has gained?
What has been won?
</P>
<P>
   The Independent on Sunday has opposed this conflict from the
beginning, and we see no reason to change our view now. The war has
been waged in defiance of international law. By no criterion can it
be described as just.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand we believe that NATO's motives were honorable.
Slobodan Milosevic is a ruthless and wicked man; his policy towards
the Albanians in Kosovo has been breathtakingly vicious.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact is that the attempt by the alliance to avert a
humanitarian catastrophe in the Balkans has resulted in a
humanitarian catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   The world today, furthermore, is an infinitely more dangerous
place than it was on March 24 when the bombers went in.
</P>
<P>
   There are some who see the Serbians as Milosevic's ``willing
executioners'' and therefore legitimate targets of NATO's bombers.
We do not.
</P>
<P>
   It is of course true that the alliance was scrupulous in its
attempts to avoid civilian deaths _ almost as scrupulous as it was
in its (successful) attempts to avoid the deaths of its own airmen
_ but it nevertheless waged war against the civilian population of
Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   The collateral damage was inevitable. Throughout Yugoslavia
thousands of innocents have been killed and maimed. Millions have
been terrorized _ tortured by the nightly scream and roar of the
raiders, deprived of warmth and light and security.
</P>
<P>
   Mistargeted bombs have hit an old people's home, a gynecological
clinic, a prison, a hospital, blocks of apartments, a refugee
convoy, neutral embassies, a KLA post, an Albanian village and the
capital of Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo itself the bombs provided a smoke screen for the death
squads, accelerated massacres and precipitated the most savage
phase in a long history of ethnic hatred.
</P>
<P>
   The land is now so wasted and stained that it is impossible to
imagine Albanians and Serbs living there together in peace.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a million refugees have escaped into stinking,
comfortless camps, from which hopes of quickly rescuing them are
bleak.
</P>
<P>
   Now what? The war in Kosovo is likely to enter a new phase _ a
grinding, guerrilla war between the KLA and nominally unofficial
Serb militias.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peacekeepers'' will get caught in the cross-fire. Ethnic
cleansing will almost certainly continue, edging Kosovo towards
partition, in what has become the standard Balkan pattern.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing to rejoice at here. Consider, meanwhile, what
the peace deal actually says. Its first deficiency is that the KLA
is not a party to it. The ``end of violence and repression'' in
Kosovo cannot therefore be guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   The Rambouillet accords have been effectively shredded: in
diplomatic weasel-speak, the promise that they will be ``fully
considered'' means that they will be ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has succeeded in obliterating the promises he opposed:
the international force is excluded from Serbia and Montenegro; the
integrity of Yugoslavia is guaranteed; the prospect of independent
Kosovo is scotched; there is no room for a meaningful referendum.
</P>
<P>
   In these circumstances, NATO's hope that the KLA will
voluntarily disarm looks risible.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, no one can genuinely implement the withdrawal of all
armed forces from Kosovo. The KLA will remain _ probably mouthing
compliance while keeping trigger-fingers busy. Serb communities
will shelter fighters for the next phase.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, it looks as though the U.N. force will enter an
active arena, in hostile terrain. Paramilitaries will operate out
of the buffer zone and areas policed by Russia, or make sallies
from Albania or under cover of returning refugees.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has had to surrender control of the field. The interim
administration will be determined by the U.N. Security Council _ it
will have to suit Russia and China.
</P>
<P>
   The international force will be riven by ambiguities. The
Russians will have their own command structure. Other non-NATO
contingents will have the right to theirs.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's war aims have narrowed to clearing up its own wreckage
and returning the refugees whose expulsion it helped to provoke.
</P>
<P>
   It need never have come to this. If the allies had been more
conciliatory at Rambouillet, Milosevic might have signed the
treaty.
</P>
<P>
   But NATO insisted that, as well as having free access to all
parts of Yugoslavia, its troops should be immune from criminal
prosecution. Had that clause not been included there could have
been a deal.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that Milosevic could by now have broken the deal, as
he did the earlier peace deal last October. Then again, he may
break the deal that has just been brokered by Ahtisaari and
Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
   The horrors are not over. When the peacekeeping force enters
Kosovo there is no knowing what they will find.
</P>
<P>
   It could be that they will uncover mass graves. There may be
tens of thousands of bodies waiting for them. That would still not
justify the war, however. That would provide the alliance with that
most miserable of all justifications: a postwar casus belli. &QL;

SLEEPWALKING CASE ADDS `NERD' DEFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service
 clients)  
 By BY JERRY KAMMER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Scott Falater's defense team isn't just putting on a
sleepwalking defense in the former Motorola engineer's murder
trial, which has focused national attention on Phoenix's Maricopa
County courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   The defense is also defending Falater as too mild-mannered and
controlled _ too much of a nerd _ to have deliberately stabbed his
wife to death.
</P>
<P>
   The nerd defense in this strangest of cases began to emerge two
weeks ago in defense attorney Michael Kimerer's opening statement.
He is asking the jury to accept this courtroom equation:
Sleepwalker plus nerd does not equal murderer.
</P>
<P>
   When Falater was a schoolboy near Chicago, Kimerer said, ``he
was thought of as being kind of a nerd.'' He had preferred science
to sports, liked chemistry sets and ham radio, tended a paper
route, and periodically wet his bed.
</P>
<P>
   Since the trial's opening, the nerd defense has come up
repeatedly in a trial spawned by that horrific night in December
1997 when Falater admittedly stabbed his wife 44 times with a
hunting knife, dragged her into the backyard pool and then stashed
his bloody clothing before police arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Kimerer has elicited descriptions of Falater-as-nerd from
several defense witnesses. They have also helped the defense
portray the 43-year-old defendant as a dedicated husband and
father, devout Mormon and respected engineer at Motorola.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's kind of nerdy,'' 17-year-old daughter Megan testified.
``He plays around with his ham radio, but he's very friendly and
nice to all people.''
</P>
<P>
   Falater's sister also joined in. When Kimerer asked if she had
considered her brother to be a nerd, Laura Healy quickly answered,
``Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   If Falater is to win acquittal, the defense must convince the
jury that the only explanation for the savage attack by such a
mild-mannered man was that Falater's overactive brain was asleep.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the brain was awake, Kimerer acknowledges, but not the
part responsible for conscious thought and deliberate action.
</P>
<P>
   Kimerer says the attack makes no sense because Falater had no
motive.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was just no rhyme or reason why Scott Falater would have
killed the woman that he loved more than anything else in the
world,'' said Kimerer. Sleepwalking is the only explanation that
makes sense, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kimerer established last week that Falater has a history of
sleepwalking. Falater's parents testified that they were once
amused by his infrequent late-night amblings, including the time
that he walked stark naked into the living room.
</P>
<P>
   Healy testified about an incident that occurred when Scott was a
20-year-old student in Illinois grappling with the stress of final
exams and his pending marriage to Yarmila. She said he responded
furiously when she tried to block him from sleepwalking out a
kitchen door.
</P>
<P>
   ``He lifted me up and just tossed me through the air,'' Healy
said.
</P>
<P>
   Kimerer's first expert witness, Dr. Janet Tatman, told the jury
that violence is common among sleepwalkers, especially when they
are performing some purposeful activity.
</P>
<P>
   Tatman supported Kimerer's claim that Falater's deadly
sleepwalking episode was triggered by stress and sleep deprivation.
Several of Falater's former colleagues testified that the failure
of a new Motorola computer chip had put him under tremendous
strain. Falater coordinated the design, manufacture and marketing
of the chip.
</P>
<P>
   Kimerer says Falater came home from work that fateful night in
1997, had a pleasant dinner with Yarmila and their two children,
watched TV, planned the next morning's seminary class at his
computer.
</P>
<P>
   Up to that point, Kimerer's scenario is supported by the
testimony of the two Falater children. He then relies on Falater's
recollection to say that his client attempted briefly to fix a
defective swimming pool pump. Unsuccessful, Falater gave up, kissed
Yarmila good night as she lay on the living room couch and went
upstairs to bed, the attorney said.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, Kimerer's scenario is based partly on consultation
with sleepwalking experts, but mostly on what he regards as the
best explanation of the death of Yarmila Falater.
</P>
<P>
   Kimerer says Falater was so exhausted that he fell immediately
into a deep sleep, the very stage of consciousness that is the
starting point for sleepwalking. But soon, probably within a half
hour, he arose from bed, subconsciously obsessed with fixing the
pool.
</P>
<P>
   Falater probably attacked his wife because she interfered as he
was using a hunting knife to dig an O-ring out of the pool pump,
Kimerer says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The belief is that Yarmila went outside and said something or
touched him and he immediately went into a rage, a total frenzy and
stabbed her 44 times,'' he told the jury.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he did not commit the crime of premeditated murder because
he had no conscious awareness of what he was doing.''
</P>
<P>
   If Kimerer and co-counsel Lori Voepel are successful with those
equations, Scott Falater, admitted killer, will walk out of
Maricopa County Superior Court a free man.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Juan Martinez, of course, has other ideas. He is
attempting to prove that Falater is a coldblooded murderer. He says
the attack was not an irrational eruption in the calm landscape of
a north Phoenix home, but the deliberate act of an increasingly
desperate man whose marriage had been crumbling.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution has laid out the killing in grim detail,
describing a complex series of events that apparently unfolded over
a period of about 30 minutes before police received a 911 call at
10:57 p.m. The scenario relies on the autopsy report, an eyewitness
to some of the events, and the police report.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez said Falater stabbed Yarmila 44 times, driving some of
the blows to the hilt of the hunting knife with a 4-inch blade and
slashing her hands as she tried to fight him off.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in a scenario not disputed by the defense, Falater changed
out of his bloody clothes, changed into pajamas and a T-shirt, put
on a pair of gloves, dragged Yarmila a few yards to the pool,
rolled her in and held her head under.
</P>
<P>
   After that, he went back into the house, upstairs to the bedroom
and the bathroom, and then walked downstairs, where Phoenix police
arrested him at gunpoint.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez says one of the most telling pieces of evidence is that
Falater stashed his bloody clothes in the back of his Volvo. But
Kimerer says Falater was simply returning the clothes to where he
always kept them, for use in case he broke down.
</P>
<P>
   The defense continues today. &QL;

powerful television, appearing on COPS, LAPD: Life on the Beat and

   But such reality TV shows may find police less welcoming
following two Supreme Court decisions allowing police to be sued
financially over the filming of arrests or searches on private
property. The high court ruled that so-called ``media ride-alongs''
may violate the Constitution's Fourth Amendment ban on unreasonable
searches and seizures.

   Re: Supreme Court Ruling
</P>
<P>
   To whom it may concern:
</P>
<P>
   By now you doubtless have read or heard about the Supreme Court
decisions involving media ride-alongs with police which, on first
glance, would appear to cripple the very foundation upon which our
popular ``reality'' shows are based.
</P>
<P>
   Not to worry. Now is not the time to panic. Instead, this is the
time for creative thinking. When high winds and bad weather forced
Robbie Knievel to call off his first Grand Canyon Death Jump, did
we fold the tent and wait until the next Sweeps period? Certainly
not _ we simply rescheduled a second Death Jump for the end of May
Sweeps. As our nightly lineup has proved so often, if it's tacky
enough, millions of people will watch it.
</P>
<P>
   Please take a look at the following shows we have penciled in
for the fall lineup. We're excited, and hope you will be, too.
</P>
<P>
   `` Krispy Kreme: Life on the Sweets'' _ Gritty look at what goes
on inside the popular donut shop when the ``hot donuts'' sign
lights up late at night. Plenty of grainy, jumpy, hand-held camera
shots of the donuts coming off the conveyer belt, the crowd
gathering at the cash register and the sense of relief expressed
(through close-ups) by employees at enjoying near-24-hour
unofficial police protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``McGruff: All Bark, All Bite'' _ No-holds-barred,
documentary-style feature showing a day in the life of the Crime
Dog. Nothing is out-of-bounds, as the in-school question-and-answer
segment shows. (``Do you have a dog girlfriend?'' one third-grader
asks. ``Have you had your shots?'' wonders another.) Real inside
stuff; McGruff, for instance, unwinds at one point and reveals the
effects of job pressure while lapping pensively at a small bowl of
scotch. Includes hilarious outtake footage of McGruff clowning
around with oversize fire hydrant (to be shown under closing
credits).
</P>
<P>
   ``Lovely Rita, Meter Maid'' _ (Title tentative; still checking
for permission. Possible alternate: ``Ticket to Ride,'' though
similar licensing problems may arise.) Touching weekly stories of
the most misunderstood members of the Thin Blue Line. Follows the
brave men and women in their little scooters as they chalk tires,
check their watches and hand out tickets. Short bios of each week's
subjects. WARNING: Extremely graphic language directed at officers
by motorists. Suggest scheduling after 9 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Thinner Blue Line: Police Explorers'' _ Unflinching look at
teens who hope to further their dream of becoming police officers
by participating in the community volunteer program. Each week we
follow different Explorers as they struggle with classic on-the-job
challenges posed by civilians _ indifference, ridicule and
downright hostility _ as well as acne, dating woes and other teen
problems. NOTE: Will be edited to downplay subjects' repeated
references to how much they love guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Real Stories of the Highway Patrol Motor Pool'' _ The beauty
here is in the access. Inside footage of oil changes, brake jobs,
siren repair, etc. Nothing is off-limits _ the coffee breaks, the
gossip sessions, nothing. In short, the tears, the laughter and the
personal phone calls made on company time. Massive crossover
appeal. &QL;

REVIVAL OF `DEATH OF A SALESMAN' TAKES 4 TONY AWARDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also TONY-WINNERS) 
(mk) 
 By ROBIN POGREBIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ And may the best salesman win.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the closest races of this year's theater season, Brian
Dennehy won the Tony Award Sunday night for best actor in a play
for his portrayal of Willy Loman in ``Death of a Salesman,''
beating out the other favorite, Kevin Spacey, who was nominated for
his performance as Hickey in ``The Iceman Cometh.''
</P>
<P>
   Dennehy concluded his acceptance remarks by thanking the
playwright, Arthur Miller, as well as the crowd: ``Thank you for
`Death of a Salesman,' Arthur, thank you for Willy Loman and thank
you for this.''
</P>
<P>
   In what many are calling the season of the straight play, a
season that put the work of Tennessee Williams, Miller and Eugene
O'Neill on Broadway at the same time, ``Death of a Salesman'' raked
in the awards, including best revival of a play, at the 53rd annual
Tony ceremony at the Gershwin Theater here.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Falls of ``Salesman'' won for best director and Elizabeth
Franz won for best featured actress for her new, steely take on the
wife of Willy Loman. Topping it off, Miller received a special Tony
Award for lifetime achievement.
</P>
<P>
   In his acceptance speech, Miller said that if plays like
``Iceman'' and ``Salesman'' were received in the mail by producers
today, ``they would be unlikely to show up on a Broadway stage,''
rejected as too financially risky.
</P>
<P>
   He also encouraged the crowd to welcome a new generation of
American playwrights. One such young American playwright took home
the Tony Sunday night for best new play: Warren Leight for ``Side
Man.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Side Man,'' which has been struggling to fill the theater
lately, received another welcome boost from a Tony Award for Frank
Wood as best featured actor in a play for his performance as a
weary jazz musician.
</P>
<P>
   In a surprising victory, the British choreographer Matthew
Bourne won for best director of a musical for his unorthodox
version of ``Swan Lake,'' featuring male swans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Swan Lake'' had been ruled ineligible for consideration as
best musical by the Tony Administration Committee this spring.
``I'm absolutely astonished,'' Bourne said in his acceptance
speech. ``Best director of a musical that's not even a musical.''
</P>
<P>
   Bourne also won the award for best choreography, thanking ``the
composer of probably the greatest score on Broadway this or any
year, Tchaikovsky.''
</P>
<P>
   The costume designer of ``Swan Lake,'' Lez Brotherston, also
received a Tony award.
</P>
<P>
   It was a triumphant night for ``Annie Get Your Gun,'' which won
the Tony for best musical revival as well as for best actress in a
musical, Bernadette Peters.
</P>
<P>
   Although ``You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown'' lost to ``Annie,''
two of its featured actors received Tonys Sunday night: Kristin
Chenoweth, who plays Sally, and Roger Bart, who plays Snoopy.
</P>
<P>
   The awards could offer a welcome lift to ``Charlie Brown,''
which has also been hanging on at the box office.
</P>
<P>
   In a race that some considered a test of art versus commerce,
``Fosse'' won for best musical, beating out the other leading
contender, ``Parade,'' which closed in February at Lincoln Center
Theater in the wake of mixed reviews and the financial troubles of
its co-producer, Livent. ``Fosse'' also won Tonys for lighting
design and orchestrations.
</P>
<P>
   Because a Tony Award can mean box office success as well as
artistic excellence, some argued that only ``Fosse'' was in a
position to benefit financially, particularly on the road, since
``Parade'' is no longer running.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parade,'' the story of the 1915 lynching of Leo Frank, a
Jewish factory supervisor, did earn its share of important prizes,
however.
</P>
<P>
   The award for best book went to ``Parade's'' author, Alfred
Uhry, best known for his play ``Driving Miss Daisy.''
</P>
<P>
   In his acceptance speech, Uhry announced that the musical would
start a yearlong tour in June in Atlanta and, ``Who knows, look for
us maybe to return to New York.''
</P>
<P>
   And the award for best score went to Jason Robert Brown, the
28-year-old composer of ``Parade.'' Brown thanked Harold Prince,
the director of ``Parade,'' for giving him the opportunity to write
his first musical score. (He also thanked his ``wonderful
supportive family _ no matter what I say in therapy.'') ``Parade''
was not the only production to win awards posthumously. Martin
Short won for best leading actor in a musical for his off-the-wall
performance in ``Little Me,'' which closed in February.
</P>
<P>
   In his reliably funny acceptance speech, Short said, ``Please be
seated'' when no one was standing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many people I could thank and should,'' Short
continued, ``but the reality is, I did it all myself.''
</P>
<P>
   As predicted, Dame Judi Dench won the Tony for best performance
by an actress in a play for her work in David Hare's ``Amy's
View,'' which marked Dame Judi's return to the New York stage after
40 years.
</P>
<P>
   In a category that had the designer Bob Crowley competing
against himself for his creations of a weathered bar in ``The
Iceman Cometh'' and his ethereal Illyria in ``Twelfth Night,'' the
award for scenic design went to Richard Hoover for his cold,
clanging cellblock in ``Not About Nightingales.'' The play by a
young Williams was recently unearthed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to talk about a ghost in this room _ Tennessee,''
Hoover said, ``and I'm sure he's smiling right now, as I am
inside.''
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony's second two hours opened with ``There's No
Business Like Show Business,'' from ``Annie Get Your Gun,'' and
featured scenes from the other nominated musicals, including ``The
Civil War'' and ``Fosse.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   While some critics have bemoaned what they described as a dearth
of exciting work on Broadway this season, box office revenue and
attendance hit new records. Total grosses rose to more than $588
million, up 5.5 percent over last year, according to Variety, and
attendance reached nearly 12 million, a 2.9 percent jump.
Nevertheless, the increases were smaller than those of last year,
when box office rose 11.6 percent and attendance 9.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The American Theater Wing's 53rd annual Antoinette Perry Awards,
known as the Tonys, were named for Ms. Perry, an actress, director
and producer who died in 1946 after having been one of the leaders
of the wing, a theater service organization. The awards were first
presented in 1947 and first broadcast nationally in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   This year's nominees, announced on May 3, were selected by a
28-member committee. The 812 Tony voters, made up of theater
professionals and journalists, cast ballots in 21 categories. The
Tonys are presented by the wing and the League of American Theaters
and Producers, a trade group.
</P>
<P>
   The first hour of the ceremony, broadcast on PBS, included a
special Tony Award for regional theater, a grant of $25,000, which
went to the Crossroads Theater in New Brunswick, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining two hours of the presentation were shown on CBS
and featured the presentation of 12 awards.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two years, the ceremony received increased publicity
and ratings because it had Rosie O'Donnell as host and was held at
Radio City Music Hall. This year, Ms. O'Donnell said she was unable
to do the awards and the ceremony instead featured various
presenters.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night's event, however, had its share of star power, with
presenters such as Phylicia Rashad, Chita Rivera and Laurence
Fishburne. Other celebrities included Bea Arthur, Calista
Flockhart, Julie Andrews, Carol Burnett, Alec Baldwin, Kevin Kline,
William Hurt, Sarah Jessica Parker and Matthew Broderick.
</P>
<P>
   Among the more interesting pairings were the past and current
Hickeys, Spacey and Jason Robards; and Swoosie Kurtz and Ben
Stiller, who appeared together in ``House of Blue Leaves'' in 1986,
for which Ms. Kurtz won a Tony. Hare and Dame Judi also presented
together; Hare has three shows on Broadway this season, including
``Amy's View,'' which features Dame Judi, and ``Via Dolorosa,'' his
one-man play about Israel, in which he stars. None of his works
were nominated as plays.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Miller, special Tony Awards went to the actress
Uta Hagen and to the production ``Fool Moon,'' a series of mimed
sketches created by and starring Bill Irwin and David Shiner, that
had been to Broadway twice before, in 1993 and 1995, and returned
last fall for a limited engagement.
</P>
<P>
   A special award for lifetime achievement was given to Isabelle
Stevenson, who served as president of the wing from 1966 until last
year, when she became chairwoman and was succeeded as president by
Roy Somlyo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stood on the sidelines for half a century and watched other
people receive Tony Awards,'' Ms. Stevenson said in her acceptance
remarks, ``and now at last I get my own.''
</P>
<P>
   The wing offers performances in hospitals and schools and a
series of seminars about the theater that are broadcast by the City
University of New York's educational cable television station.
</P>
<P>
   The wing was founded in 1917, when a group of women organized to
aid war relief. In addition to clothing and food collection
centers, Stage Women's War Relief, as it was then known,
established a canteen for servicemen on Broadway, and began to send
entertainers where they were needed. In the 1940s, the group was
renamed the American Theater Wing War Service and was a branch of
the British War Relief Society. After Pearl Harbor, the wing became
an independent organization perhaps most famous for its Stage Door
Canteens.
</P>
<P>
   In what has become an annual rite of Tony season, this year had
its share of prenomination confusion and controversy. The producers
of ``Salesman'' successfully petitioned the Tony administration
committee to have Ms. Franz considered as a featured rather than
leading actress because of the stiff competition from Dame Judi and
from Zoe Wanamaker, who starred in ``Electra.''
</P>
<P>
   And although the revised book of ``Annie Get Your Gun'' was
deemed Tony-eligible, the revised book of ``You're a Good Man,
Charlie Brown'' was not.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
PORTLAND, Ore. _ The Portland Trail Blazers made their little run,
took their little lead and allowed themselves a moment to fool
themselves one last time.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The masses stuffed into the Rose Garden danced and sang. The
Trail Blazers seemed ready to all but disrobe as they did to
celebrate their second-round victory that would be their last.
</P>
<P>
   The San Antonio Spurs watched this, and center David Robinson
said they smiled, knowing what would come, almost choosing the way
to best fly into the NBA Finals for the first time in franchise
history. They could have waited for the Blazers to self-destruct
under the weight of their foolishness. They could have won in the
final seconds.
</P>
<P>
   But as if to fittingly mark the occasion of their remarkable
flight to the Finals, the Spurs calmly kicked it into another gear
Sunday and more than blew past the exposed Trail Blazers 94-80.
</P>
<P>
   With sweeps of the conference semifinals and finals, the NBA's
first such feat of the decade, the Spurs began to lap the league, a
spectacular fourth quarter Sunday offering a reminder while they
wait for a challenger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel sorry for whoever comes out of the East,'' Spurs guard
Mario Elie said.
</P>
<P>
   But before they consider the Knicks or Pacers, the Spurs
dismissed the Trail Blazers with a performance more impressive than
even their 31-5 finish to the regular season or an 11-1 playoff
record.
</P>
<P>
   After a 22-point win Friday, the Spurs shrugged off the Blazers'
third-quarter run and rolled up a 19-point lead, dominating the
fourth quarter before Spurs coach Gregg Popovich, like a junior
high coach, could let all the fellows play for the fun of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way we won, we proved something,'' Spurs forward Sean
Elliott said, as if the consecutive sweeps of the prodigious
talents of the Blazers and Lakers did not. ``We proved we're the
best team out there. We're not there yet. We still have a lot ahead
of us. We just need four more.''
</P>
<P>
   And though Elliott meant four more wins, the way the Spurs
finished off the Trail Blazers, he could have accurately meant they
would need just four more games to take an NBA title.
</P>
<P>
   From the moment the Blazers took their lead, the Spurs scored on
10 consecutive trips down the floor. While the Blazers quickly
reverted to desperate one-on-one moves and long jumpers, the Spurs
converted five consecutive layups, dunks or tips.
</P>
<P>
   They worked off one another confidently, easily, coming from
every direction and scoring as if they had been only waiting for
the right moment.
</P>
<P>
   In a span of 3{ minutes the Spurs put together a 17-4 run to an
81-67 lead, and within the first five minutes of the fourth quarter
Elliott, Robinson, Jaren Jackson, Tim Duncan and Avery Johnson
scored.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just the way we did it shows how awesome our team is,'' Duncan
said. ``Everybody made a big play. A.J. Sean. Myself. Dave. Jaren.
We just read the defense and made a great play. People kept making
plays down the stretch, and that's what makes a championship
team.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the lottery-pick talent of the Blazers, the Spurs proved
more well-rounded, deep and balanced. It was not just that the
Spurs' bench outscored the Blazers' bench 23-10. Rather than simply
ride Duncan as they had to sweep the Lakers, the Spurs got whatever
they needed from a variety of sources.
</P>
<P>
   Everything started with Robinson and Duncan inside, and they
finished with 38 points. But with the Blazers determined to send
whatever defensive attention was necessary to force the other Spurs
to beat them, Johnson finished with 15, his fourth consecutive game
in double figures. Elliott had 16. And Jackson came off the bench
to make three fourth-quarter treys and score 11 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers seemed only to get in each other's way.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have togetherness and cohesion and a belief and the
desire to just win, and win only, then you'll be in the Spurs'
locker room,'' Portland guard Greg Anthony said. ``If you have any
other issues at hand, then those sometimes will dictate and
determine your fate. It's obviously no secret that we've had
issues, and that's so unfortunate.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a very good basketball team. They're playing as well
as anybody. It's almost as if they're destined.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs seemed to feel that way, celebrating with a few hugs
and high-fives but relatively quietly, with no wild dances to
remind of the Trail Blazers' revelry after beating the Jazz. No
champagne, no locker-room shouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been 10 long years, but it's just what I imagined it
would be like,'' Robinson said. ``It's what I dream about. It just
feels good to get to where you want to be. We've grown a lot. I
feel good about what we have accomplished, and now we've got our
sights set on the next goal.''
</P>
<P>
   They might as well, having accomplished more than any Spurs team
ever has, and with the sweeps, more than even they expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought we could beat these teams, but sweeps? No,'' Spurs
owner Peter Holt said. ``It's been 26 years we've been (in San
Antonio). Now we're going. This is beautiful. Beautiful.''

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
PORTLAND, Ore. _ After all the years and all of the characters who
were saltier than the rim on a margarita glass, it is more than a
bit ironic that the group of Spurs who at long last reached the NBA
Finals had the personality to match their locker-room celebration
drink of choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Water,'' said point guard and lightning rod Avery Johnson.
``We're just a group of working men who get to take a break now.
You get yourself a little sip and then get back to the job. There's
still work to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Though how much of it remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   As the playoffs have progressed, so have the Spurs, becoming the
basketball version of an avalanche hurtling down a mountainside
burying every village in its path.
</P>
<P>
   They swept the Lakers. They swept the Trail Blazers.
</P>
<P>
   They started out the season 6-8 and have lost only six games
since then.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's June,'' Mario Elie said. ``Do you realize how impressive
that is?''
</P>
<P>
   Impressive enough to make you wonder what might have happened if
the Chicago dynasty and Michael Jordan hadn't scattered into the
hoop winds?
</P>
<P>
   In none of their six championship seasons did the Bulls ever
sweep both the second and third rounds of the playoffs. In none of
their climbs to the top of the heap did the Bulls ever have to deal
with a two-headed front-line monster like Tim Duncan and David
Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   In South Texas, just call them Los Toros.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could bring Chicago on, and I'd take my chances,'' Elie
said. ``I look at all of those championships won by the Bulls, and
they never really had to go through a team with a strong low-post
game. That's why I thought that our team in Houston in '97 with
Charles (Barkley) and Dream (Hakeem Olajuwon) could have given the
Bulls all they could handle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now you're talking about this team with these two guys, Dave
and Tim, and I'm telling you we wouldn't give anything up. The only
mismatch out there on the floor would be me trying to guard Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm telling you, man, this is a team that can stand up to
anybody and do so many things to take you out of your game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs are able to do it because they have Robinson _ a past
MVP _ and Duncan _ a future MVP _ and the ability to smother
offenses like a wet blanket thrown onto a campfire.
</P>
<P>
   It is not a coincidence that the high-profile offense of the
Lakers took a nose dive against the Spurs. And it is not
coincidence that the red-hot Blazers went south as well.
</P>
<P>
   It is a bit strange, though, to think of the Spurs and their
history of great offensive performers finally making it to the
Finals because this team works on all of the solid fundamental
parts of the game. And defense.
</P>
<P>
   The victory run this spring has been payback for all of the
heartbreak of the past. For the fancy finger rolls by the Iceman,
George Gervin, that couldn't carry them quite far enough. For the
skywalking antics of Larry Kenon and the slick moves of James Silas
and the sharpshooting of Louie Dampier that came up short.
</P>
<P>
   This was a makeup for Johnny Moore's bout with desert fever that
helped sidetrack a Spurs team. It was redemption for Rod
Strickland's ill-fated over-the-head pass and for Robinson getting
torched by Olajuwon in that fateful 1995 playoff meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been some disappointments for those of us who have
been around the team for some years,'' Johnson said. ``In some
seasons, I always thought we were missing a little bit of depth or
something. In 1995, I did believe we had a team that was capable of
going all the way. That team did have all of the pieces, and to
lose to Houston really hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this team, well, just look at us.''
</P>
<P>
   Look at the way the Spurs kept their heads down and focused on
the task again Sunday. They withstood an early 8-0 blast by the
Blazers and then saw Portland tiptoe back to take a 59-58 lead on a
runner by Damon Stoudamire with 1:35 left in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I've liked about this team is we just play for minutes
one through 48,'' coach Gregg Popovich said. ``We don't worry about
what's going on with the other team or what they're doing. We just
keep playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is what happened when the Blazers pushed them. The Spurs
responded by taking the ball to the basket and taking the game and
the season to Portland. They were Sean Elliott going inside and
Duncan and Robinson following. They scored on 10 of their first 12
possessions of the fourth quarter and were on their way to a new
place, a different place.
</P>
<P>
   After three years in the ABA and 23 seasons in the NBA, the
Spurs who were always known for being hotter than jalapenos are
playing for the whole enchilada with a cool, cool group.
</P>
<P>
   Los Toros.
</P>
<P>
   Still water runs deep.

 By JOSEPH DUARTE  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
MINNEAPOLIS _ When asked to describe Sunday's lopsided 13-6 loss to
the Minnesota Twins in one word, Tim Bogar had trouble coming up
with a response.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I might have to invent one,'' the Astros shortstop said. ``How
about ugly? Has anybody used that word? It was just flat-out ugly.
I've always been told if you're going to lose, lose quickly. This
one felt like a decade.''
</P>
<P>
   After Minnesota scored the most runs of any Astros opponent in
three years, words _ and explanations _ were hard to come by in the
Astros' clubhouse. Every pitch the Twins saw seemingly turned into
a hit. And everything that possibly could go wrong for the Astros
did.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros committed three errors, had two wild pitches and a
passed ball, gave up 16 hits and allowed four stolen bases _
through the first five innings.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the Twins were done Sunday, every Minnesota starter
had at least two hits, catcher Javier Valentin came within a single
of the cycle, and the Astros' pitching staff looked like it had
just gone nine rounds with Oscar De La Hoya.
</P>
<P>
   The result was a TKO.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros delivered the first of many blows in the game,
knocking Twins starter LaTroy Hawkins out after only two innings.
But from that point, the Astros became Minnesota's personal
punching bag, stumbling around on defense while making the Twins'
season-high 21-hit outburst look all too easy.
</P>
<P>
   The 13 runs were the most allowed by the Astros since Colorado
scored 14 on June 6, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very sloppy start defensively, and we could never
turn the momentum,'' said Astros manager Larry Dierker, who watched
the Twins score nine consecutive runs to wipe out a 4-2 deficit.
``We didn't pitch real well. You're not going to win many games
when you are behind in the count. It was just a long day. I don't
think anybody enjoyed it.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless, of course, you happened to be the Twins, who caught the
breaks and found the holes at just the right times. And for a team
that had lost four consecutive games, nine of its past 10 and 15 of
its past 20, a little luck never hurts.
</P>
<P>
   A pair of Astros errors in the first inning led to the Twins'
first two runs. Alex Diaz, making his sixth start in left field,
bobbled a single by Brent Gates that tied the game at 1, and two
batters later catcher Paul Bako misplayed a high chopper in front
of the plate.
</P>
<P>
   In the eighth, Minnesota's Ron Coomer hit a home run that
bounced off center fielder Richard Hidalgo's glove and over the
fence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a bad, bad game,'' Bako said. ``The only thing good to
come out of it is it only counts for one loss. It seemed like so
long when we were out there. It just drained everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentin finished 3-for-5, needing a single in his final at-bat
in the eighth inning to become the first Twins player to hit for
the cycle since Kirby Puckett on Aug. 1, 1986. He flied out to left
field. Valentin tripled in the second, homered in the fourth and
doubled in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   ``My teammates were kidding me that if I hit it to the wall I
should have pulled a hammy (hamstring) or missed first base and had
to go back,'' Valentin said.
</P>
<P>
   Gates and Todd Walker each had three hits for the Twins, who had
lost a pair of one-run games to the National League Central leaders
to start the interleague series.
</P>
<P>
   Astros first baseman Jeff Bagwell went 3-for-3, including his
17th home run of the season and a fly-ball single off the Metrodome
roof. Russ Johnson hit his first home run since being called up
from the minors April 27, and Craig Biggio had a two-run double.
</P>
<P>
   That was the extent of the damage by the Astros, who managed
only two runs off three Twins relievers over the final 7 innings.
Benj Sampson (1-0) pitched 3 scoreless innings in relief of Hawkins
to pick up the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, righthander Sean Bergman (3-2), who shut out
Milwaukee last Tuesday, lasted only 3 innings in his shortest
outing of the season for the Astros. He gave up 11 hits and six
runs, tying season highs set against Pittsburgh on May 11.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros' bullpen struggled for the second straight day. Jeff
McCurry and Brian Williams combined to allow seven runs and 10 hits
in 4 innings. In the past two games, the Astros' relief corps has
surrendered 11 runs and 16 hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were swinging, and everything they hit was finding
holes,'' Williams said. ``All you can try and do is make the
pitches. It seemed like every ball they hit was between first and
second base. I just went out there trying to shut them down and
keep the game close. I didn't end up doing that. I'm not happy with
it. I really don't know what to say about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros held the lead briefly after scoring four runs during
the first two innings to send Hawkins to his early exit. Hawkins
allowed four runs on five hits and three walks.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after, the Twins' fortunes changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way it goes sometimes,'' Bogar said. ``It was one
of those days where we really didn't have a chance no matter what
we did.''

 By DALE ROBERTSON  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
PARIS _ Trying, but failing, to fight back tears, Andre Agassi had
no explanation for what happened to him Sunday.
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the staggering emotion of the moment, he couldn't divulge why
he started so badly or how he could turn himself around so
completely. It was impossible for him to say how he almost lost the
French Open final, or how he found a way to will himself to win it,
thus completing the fifth career Grand Slam in men's tennis
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea,'' Agassi said. ``I really don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Technically speaking, the reason was simple. He couldn't time a
ball to save his life for two cold, blustery sets, but once he
found his groove, it would be all blue skies. Indeed, the sun was
sparkling brightly on the Coupe Musketeers as Agassi held it aloft,
celebrating the most compelling, significant, surprising and
satisfying victory of his hot-and-cold, up-and-down career.
</P>
<P>
   ``My greatest moment ever on a tennis court,'' Agassi called the
1-6, 2-6, 6-4, 6-3, 6-4 comeback of a lifetime against Andrei
Medvedev. This from a guy who won Wimbledon in 1992, the U.S. Open
in '94 and the Australian Open in '95. But also a guy whose ranking
had sunk to 140th in the world two summers ago, when he nursed a
sore shoulder and tried to make a new marriage _ now doomed _ work.
</P>
<P>
   And who, in back-to-back French finals almost a decade ago
(1990-91), against Andres Gomez and then Jim Courier, had gone in
as the favorite and failed to close the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean certainly the accomplishment of winning every Slam
speaks for itself,'' Agassi said, ``and accomplishing it on the
clay that has been a big obstacle for me, psychologically and
emotionally. There were so many reasons to be overwhelmed at that
moment (the end of the match), I don't know if I'll ever be able to
put words to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I've done is astonishing on a certain level. This is the
greatest thing I could ever accomplish.''
</P>
<P>
   Agassi, seeded 13th and ranked 14th before this tournament,
jumps to No. 4 in the world with the victory; the 100th-ranked
Medvedev cracks the top 30 again. The 24-year-old Ukrainian was
trying to become the lowest-ranked player of the Open era to win a
Slam. But he had bet friends in Germany he would be in the top 50
by year's end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won 100 marks from them,'' Medvedev said.
</P>
<P>
   He also won renewed respect for his game, which had slumped
since a semifinal appearance here in 1993 launched his rapid rise
to No. 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe I made him work for the victory,'' Medvedev said.
``I left my heart and soul on the court. I think I proved I am
back.''
</P>
<P>
   The 29-year-old Agassi's turnaround was, in one respect, the
biggest rally in the history of the Slams, given the paltry three
games he claimed in the first two sets. When Ivan Lendl defeated
John McEnroe here in 1984, the only other time during 31 years of
Open tennis when a two-set lead slipped away during the final of a
major, Lendl had at least won five games, although he also survived
a 3-all, 15-40 jam in the third set.
</P>
<P>
   After 52 minutes, Agassi was a quivering mess _ literally. On
the changeovers, he sat in his chair, both legs shaking furiously.
And with good reason. He was in a deep hole _ the first set had
lasted only 19 minutes _ and seemingly bamboozled. The game's best
returner hadn't won a point against Medvedev's first serve, and his
own serve was a disaster, far more of a liability than a weapon.
</P>
<P>
   He had confronted break points in six of seven games and managed
to stave off defeat just once. His second serve was a juicy treat
for the pouncing Medvedev, who won 84 percent of the points after
an Agassi fault.
</P>
<P>
   Even a 29-minute rain delay after the first game of the second
set was of no obvious help. Although he huddled with coach Brad
Gilbert, trying to figure out where he was going wrong, he lost
five consecutive games after play resumed and had to stave off
three set points against his serve in the sixth game. Medvedev
shrugged off the setback and proceeded to hold at love.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tough time on the rain delay,'' Agassi's longtime
coach and friend Gilbert said. ``It was like he didn't know what
the hell was going on out there. Certainly my good coaching brought
him back to 6-2. God, I was really thinking, `Man, if we get
another rain delay, I'd better chill for a while.'
</P>
<P>
   ``But ultimately, it felt good for him to stop. We went over a
lot of things. I just told him, `Play your game; your game will
take you through. At least make him beat you playing your game.'''
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert admitted he also considered taking a two-by-four to
Agassi's skull to drive home that message but then thought better
of it.
</P>
<P>
   Both lost sets ended with pulverizing Medvedev aces. It took
Agassi nine games to so much as reach deuce against Medvedev's
serve. His first break didn't come until the 70th minute of the
match, and then he was broken back. At love.
</P>
<P>
   It was a shocking turn of events. But it also proved a horribly
false read. Agassi had fought his way into his third Roland Garros
final by suckering several opponents into thinking they had him.
The previous Sunday, he got defending champion Carlos Moya to bite,
and the unsuspecting Medvedev would be similarly duped. Tennis'
Rope-A-Dope?
</P>
<P>
   After 2 hours, 7 minutes, the match was dead level. No matter
that Medvedev held the lead in aces 21-1, or that Agassi had hit
just 57 percent of his first serves.
</P>
<P>
   The first signs of Agassi's resurgence were two strong service
games at the start of the third set, followed by his first break
for a 4-2 lead. Although Medvedev would immediately answer with
same, he had begun to press and Agassi pounced, breaking for the
set at love.
</P>
<P>
   From that point forward, he applied the pressure with scorching
returns and a down-the-line backhand that almost never failed him
at crucial junctures. He needed just a break in the second game to
claim the fourth set, and once he saved a break point in the second
game of the fifth set he was never in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the point probably where I will remember I made the
mistake,'' Medvedev said. ``It wasn't a big serve. For some reason,
instead of playing safer, which would be high topspin to his
backhand, I went for a strange shot, which would not have hurt him
anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Medvedev went down swinging, though. He saved three match points
_ the first with his 23rd ace _ against his serve in the
next-to-last game, which went to five deuces and proved to be the
match's most pitched battle.
</P>
<P>
   But losing it didn't ruffle Agassi. Serving for the championship
after 2 hours, 50 minutes, he dropped just one point, winning when
Medvedev whacked a forehand long.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest,'' Medvedev said, ``I cannot say I (did)
something wrong. I think Andre just played unbelievable. He
deserves all the credit. I'm human. I am disappointed that I didn't
win. But on the other hand, the happiness I have in my heart for
being in the hunt, in the competition, that by far outweighs the
disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever happens in the future, if I win three Grand Slams in
a row or four, these two weeks will for sure be the happiest of my
life. I just came up short against a great player.''
</P>
<P>
   By one measuring stick at least, one of the five greatest ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``This accomplishment could never be a burden,'' Agassi said.
``It's given me so much that I'll try to do more just because of
how good it feels.''
</P>
<P>
   He paused, then smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been 25 years or so since somebody has won the French and
Wimbledon in the same year,'' Agassi said. ``That would be
something.''

<P>
   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
PARIS _ It was widely speculated Sunday that Pete Sampras, nice guy
though he might be, was bearing Andre Agassi considerable malice.
</P>
<P>
   You could picture Pete sprawled on the sofa in front of his
big-screen TV for the start of the French Open final, his breakfast
untouched, sticking pins in an Agassi doll. Because, for all of
Sampras' accomplishments, and the list is prodigious, he had failed
to do what Andre was one match from doing.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, Pete dozed off.
</P>
<P>
   And when he woke up, Agassi had the prize in hand, the Coupe
Musketeers, that goes to the champion of Roland Garros. In Agassi's
case, it signified an even bigger prize, the icing on his cake, the
completion of a rare career Grand Slam.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras had been gone from Paris for 10 days after failing to
survive into the third round of the French, the tournament that
routinely slams him grandly. The greatest player of his day,
Sampras never has made it past a semifinal on the terre battue, and
it's this void in his rsum that will deprive him of a universal
consensus that he is the greatest player of any day.
</P>
<P>
   If Pete's mind is right in the weeks ahead, he is a solid bet to
win a third consecutive Wimbledon for the second time, thereby
leaving him tied with Roy Emerson for most majors won, 12. Because
Emerson's record always has borne an asterisk _ Rod Laver, having
been banned as a professional, was absent from almost all the
tournaments Emmo won _ and given the greater depth on the tour
today, it's reasonable to insist Sampras' total is easily the more
remarkable accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   But the French thing dogs him. It keeps Sampras from receiving
his due in full. Pete's predictable annual flameout on the red clay
accentuates a conspicuous hole in his game.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that the four players before Agassi who completed a
Slam in their lifetimes won the four events on only two surfaces,
grass and Roland Garros' red clay. There wasn't a hardcourt major
until the U.S. Open switched over at Flushing Meadow in 1978. The
Australian Open followed a decade later.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras, of course, has won on grass and both kinds of
hardcourts _ the American DecoTurf II and the Aussies' Rebound Ace.
And the sum of his titles _ five at Wimbledon, four in New York,
two in Melbourne _ over a nine-year span is a supreme achievement,
clearly dwarfing what Agassi has done.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there were those, Andrei Medvedev among them, who surmised
after Agassi's astonishing, historic 1-6, 2-6, 6-4, 6-3, 6-4 win
over Medvedev that his four championships on the four surfaces made
him Sampras' near equal.
</P>
<P>
   ``He deserves to make the argument,'' Medvedev said.
</P>
<P>
   Uh, with no disrespect to either Andre(i) intended, hogwash.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras' views on the subject will be known soon enough. Agassi,
for his part, tried to dodge the question but seemed to imply there
was room for a measure of debate.
</P>
<P>
   You wonder how badly each covets the other's accomplishments.
How many of his trophies would Sampras swap for the loving cup
Andre held high over his head here Sunday afternoon?
</P>
<P>
   Two? Three? None?
</P>
<P>
   ``I can go to sleep at night,'' Agassi insisted, ``and honestly
say I wouldn't give up my career for anybody's.''
</P>
<P>
   A few folks close to Pete claim he has conceded defeat here,
that a Roland Garros pelt never will be his to claim. Almost 28,
with his leonine body starting to rebel at the rigors of his
profession, he would have to make major sacrifices to give himself
any kind of chance on Court Central.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras would have to dedicate himself to a clay-court training
regimen, and that would hinder his preparations for Wimbledon,
where another huge carrot on a string tantalizes him. A sixth
Wimbledon title, you see, will break the modern record he shares
with Bjorn Borg, as well as separating him in the Slam standings
from Borg and his childhood idol Laver, who also own 11 majors
apiece.
</P>
<P>
   At this stage in his career, Sampras sees surpassing Emerson as
his clearest, safest path to immortality, if not necessarily
unequivocal acceptance as the No. 1 for all time. He'll take the
two championships he needs wherever he can get them, and obviously
the lush lawns of the All England Club are most suited to his heavy
artillery.
</P>
<P>
   On dirt, Pete is just a panting, perspiring face in the crowd.
On grass, he is Mark McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   As for Agassi, his going 4-for-4 merits a new look at his place
in history, which is unique. Remember, what he has done is
unprecedented in the Open era, and thus it must separate him from
the pack, too.
</P>
<P>
   Borg's 11 Slams don't include a U.S. Open. Ivan Lendl (eight)
and Mats Wilander (seven) are minus the Wimbledon leg. Jimmy
Connors (eight), Stefan Edberg (six) and Boris Becker (six) each
suffered from the same allergy to the crushed brick that bedevils
Sampras.
</P>
<P>
   And John McEnroe's seven were limited to Wimbledon and the U.S.
Open, although he came close here once, blowing a two-sets-to-love
lead to Lendl in the '84 final, the only Open-era precedent for
what happened to Andrei Medvedev on Sunday. Had he won, he might
have made more of an effort in Australia, where he rarely bothered
to play.
</P>
<P>
   How does Andre fit into this august group of Open-era titans? In
tennis, does a royal flush beat a full house, irrespective of all
other data? Does he receive bonus points for variety, or do we
deduct for his modest volume?
</P>
<P>
   I vote the former. But that doesn't mean he belongs in Sampras'
league.

lead the way, embracing one of the nation's most ambitious attempts
to hold down the cost of civil suits and limit the size of jury
awards. For years, Texas had a reputation as the ``lawsuit capital
of America'' because its juries in injury cases were said to be
overly generous. But starting in the late 1980s, the state began
adding restrictions, like limits on punitive damage awards, and
provisions that make it harder for injured workers to sue. Now
Texas is seen as one of the most aggressive states in efforts to

RECENT ARRIVALS FROM KOSOVO SKEPTICAL OF PEACE PROCESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY ROBERT MONROE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It will take more than a peace treaty to satisfy
Kosovar refugees relocated to Southern California that it is safe
to return to their homeland.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives of Hajrush Vlashi, who is hosting nine of them at
least for the next few days, said Sunday they don't plan to return
home anytime soon. They want Slobodan Milosevic out of power and
the United States to remain in Kosovo after peace is forged.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way they can feel safe is if the United States is
there, not the English, not the French,'' said Vlashi, speaking for
the family.
</P>
<P>
   That means an uncertain future for the 32-member extended family
from Kosovo that is scattered around host homes in the San Fernando
Valley and nearby Westlake Village, Calabasas and Simi Valley in
neighboring Ventura County.
</P>
<P>
   Even if they felt safe, the families' farms and workplaces are
destroyed, they said. They said they have nothing to return to and
nothing with which to feed themselves until next spring.
</P>
<P>
   NATO seeks the immediate withdrawal of Yugoslav troops from
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The refugees in Vlashi's living room said they couldn't believe
peace talks had even started. They said they have heard empty
promises of peace in the past from the Serbs and expressed
frustration over a peace process that does not include their
countrymen.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these negotiations are being done without the (Kosovo
Liberation Army) or Albanians, and they don't think that will be
good enough,'' Vlashi said.
</P>
<P>
   The newest arrivals to the home of Hajrush and Renee Vlashi are
his cousin Shukri Rexha and his wife, Nadire; daughter, Nazmije;
and 23-month-old son, Andi. They join Hajrush's father, Hisman
Vlashi; mother, Shefije; and three siblings.
</P>
<P>
   Rexha, a member of the KLA police, said he came reluctantly to
the United States for the sake of his family's safety. He said he
has buried massacred children and, two months ago, barely escaped
his own death as Serb soldiers chased him through Kosovo's craggy
hills.
</P>
<P>
   The family members arrived Wednesday and have nothing to do now
but figure out a way to help their countrymen from afar, he said.
Telling of their polarized reality, their two plans for the week
are to partake in a quintessential Southern California activity _
going to the beach _ and monitoring network news to fathom what
they can about the frail peace process regarding Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Rexha, who had traveled to other European countries as a
musician before returning to join the fighting, said he is happy to
finally see Southern California, ``but when you have friends and
relatives suffering, it cuts that happiness.''
</P>
<P>
   Rexha added that he is not at liberty to discuss how much
firepower the KLA still has to fight the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   The Rexhas have had scant opportunities to take in California.
The first thing Hisman Vlashi told the Rexhas is that everything
Hajrush had told them when he moved to Southern California in 1989
is true, Hajrush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hot. There are more cars than people,'' he said. ``You
walk nowhere.'' The future is uncertain for the hosts as well, who
are still looking for ways to raise money so their relatives can
rent their own apartments and pay for their own food. The couple,
living on Hajrush's wages as a waiter and sporadic donations, are
having difficulty supporting nine relatives who go through six
loaves of sourdough bread at a meal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bread is out of control,'' Renee Vlashi said.

`PHANTOM MENACE' STILL GOING AT LIGHT SPEED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(EDITORS: Today in 2nd graf refers to Monday.)  
 
  
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``Star Wars: Episode 1 _ The Phantom Menace''
became the 14th member of the elite quarter-billion-dollar club
during the weekend as it continued to dominate business at the
nation's multiplexes with an estimated $32.2 million at 3,023
theaters during the Friday-Sunday period, studio sources said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth installment of the ``Star Wars'' saga has now taken
in $255.5 million in 19 days and will likely crack the $400 million
mark before it leaves theaters at the end of summer. ``Phantom
Menace,'' which saw grosses fall 34 percent from the previous
Friday-Sunday, is now the 12th highest grosser of all time and
should pass ``Jaws'' at $260 million for the 11th spot today or
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are very big numbers,'' declared Tom Sherak, 20th
Century Fox's distribution chief. ``We obviously can't stay like
that, but we're clearly going to wind up in the top five of all
time.'' (Current No. 5 is ``Forrest Gump,'' at $329.5 million.)
</P>
<P>
   Sherak said audiences continue to be 59 percent male and that 15
percent of ``Phantom Menace'' attendees during the weekend had
already seen the movie at least twice.
</P>
<P>
   Movie analyst Arthur Rockwell noted that ``Phantom Menace'' _
which has probably sold slightly more than 50 million tickets _ had
clearly survived the mixed critical reception that emerged just
before it opened. ``This movie is about as review-proof as they
come,'' he added. ``All that negative buzz is history.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bucksbaum, president of the Reel Source forecasting
service, said ``Phantom Menace'' should take in somewhere between
$375 million and $410 million and will benefit from the fact that
about 74 percent of the nation's schools will have let out by next
weekend. However, ``Phantom Menace'' looks likely to finish second
next weekend to the opening of New Line's ``Austin Powers: The Spy
Who Shagged Me'' due to high interest among adolescents and young
adults, Bucksbaum said, and could hit $40 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``New Line has done a great job of getting the word out on
`Austin Powers,''' he added, citing an early trailer that mildly
spoofed ``Star Wars.'' Also opening next weekend with positive buzz
is Paramount's thriller ``The General's Daughter'' with John
Travolta.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phantom Menace'' remained so dominant this weekend, however,
that it nearly matched the combined total of the next three films,
led by Universal's second weekend of ``Notting Hill'' with $15
million at 2,752 theaters. The well-reviewed romantic comedy,
starring Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant, lost about 32 percent from
its opening Friday-Sunday and has taken in close to $50million in
its first 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend's only major opening, Disney's action-adventure
``Instinct,'' posted moderate totals in third with $10.2 million at
2,059 theaters. Disney marketing executive Chuck Viane said the
movie, in which Anthony Hopkins portrays a scientist who has lived
among gorillas, received solid response from audiences and should
perform well due to positive word of mouth and its uniqueness as an
adult-oriented offering in coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Bucksbaum said ``Instinct'' was hurt by mixed reviews, since its
target audience is older than the average moviegoer, and had
performed slightly below expectations, since the weekend has
historically been a good launching point for films such as ``The
Rock,'' ``Congo,'' ``Con Air'' and ``The Truman Show.'' As a
result, Bucksbaum pointed out, the overall total for the 1999
weekend was down 14 percent from the same weekend last year, when
``The Truman Show'' debuted with $31.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Rockwell said Disney faced a tough marketing challenge in
finding an audience for ``Instinct'' but added, ``Given that this
is a prime slot, the opening is a little soft.''
</P>
<P>
   Universal continued to post solid results for its fifth weekend
of ``The Mummy'' in fourth with $7.5 million at 3,411 theaters,
pushing it past $127.6 million to 100th on the all-time list over
``My Best Friend's Wedding.'' Fox's sixth weekend of ``Entrapment''
followed with $3.5 million at 2,584 sites to hit nearly $75 million
overall.
</P>
<P>
   Warner Bros.' 10th weekend of its blockbuster virtual-reality
thriller ``The Matrix'' came in sixth with $2.4 million at 2,045
sites to top $159 million. By contrast, Sony's second weekend of
its similarly themed ``The Thirteenth Floor'' faded quickly with an
unimpressive $1.9 million at 1,815 theaters to give it $7.3 million
after 10 days. ``Floor,'' with a reported $18 million price tag,
will probably disappear with less than $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   Long-time holdovers took the final three slots, led by Fox's
ninth weekend of ``Never Been Kissed'' with $1.7 million at 2,085
theaters, as it topped $51 million in another solid performance for
Drew Barrymore, who served as producer. Fox Searchlight's fourth
weekend of ``A Midsummer Night's Dream'' came in ninth with $1.1
million at 1,005 theaters, followed by Paramount's seventh weekend
of ``Election'' with $900,000 at 827 sites.
</P>
<P>
   MGM's fourth weekend of ``Tea With Mussolini'' finished 11th
with $780,000 at 271 theaters, followed by Universal's eighth
weekend of ``Life'' with $759,000 at 1,120 theaters. Sony has
posted a solid opening of John Sayles' adventure-drama, ``Limbo,''
with $150,000 at 10 screens in its first launch from the Screen
Gems banner and will expand the run soon.

SAN ANTONIO'S TALL TANDEM REDEFINES BIG MAN'S GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. _ Given the spectacular nature of the fire that
consumed the Portland Trail Blazers, it is popular to surmise that
the often-juvenile local team screwed up somehow, perhaps lighting
a stogie while pumping gas.
</P>
<P>
   However, the immediate evidence, following Sunday's 94-80
immolation at the Rose Garden, provides an obvious case of arson by
the San Antonio Spurs.
</P>
<P>
   Heck, the Spurs will show you the kerosene and rags in the back
of their bandwagon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tired of hearing what Portland did wrong, what the Lakers
did wrong,'' said Spurs' guard Mario Elie. ``Let's give the Spurs a
little bit of credit.''
</P>
<P>
   Credit is due. Long overdue. Their second straight 4-0 sweep of
a supposed power gave the Spurs not only their first Western
Conference championship, it left them with an 11-1 record in the
playoffs _ part of an astonishing 42-6 run since the Spurs were
6-8.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was talking to Avery (Johnson), and I said, `Do you realize
we've lost six games since February?''' Elie said. ``That is
amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in this truncated, slipshod NBA season, it is a startling
feat. A good case can always be made about the decline of the NBA,
but there is no denying this fact:
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs start two of the five best centers in the league, and
no opponent is close to figuring out an effective response.
</P>
<P>
   David Robinson and Tim Duncan are about to nudge awake the
basketball historians, who've rightfully nodded off this season. If
the 7-foot pair continue to dominate either New York or Indiana in
the Finals, they will make a case for the best big-man tandem in
the sport's chronicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm 36 and I've been in the league a long time,'' said
teammate Jerome Kersey, ``and I don't remember two better offensive
centers on the same team at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   Kersey might be biased. He also might be wrong, or at least
incomplete about the offense part. They may be the best defensive
tandem, too.
</P>
<P>
   In the regular season, opponents shot just 40 percent against
the Spurs, the best mark since the league began tracking the stat
in 1970. The figure has been maintained in the postseason, which
was an especially wicked development here, where multiple Blazer
weapons were reduced to pure futility.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're so long and so big,'' marveled Blazer forward Brian
Grant. ``They're both all-NBA and deserve to be. I think they'll
carry that team to their first championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Should that come to pass, no one will be more gratified than
Robinson, who might the most disrespected superstar in the NBA
galaxy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been 10 long years,'' said Robinson of his career that is
no longer absent a Finals appearance. ``It's just what I imagined
it to be like.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had a lot of years coming in here and answering hard
questions.''
</P>
<P>
   The hard questions almost always concerned Robinson's softness.
The committed Christian and piano-playing, well-read, articulate
Annapolis graduate has always been viewed as lacking the requisite
Rottweiler demeanor for an NBA championship.
</P>
<P>
   Well, Robinson still isn't tearing pants legs off mail carriers.
But he now has teammates who do. And he has Duncan, the second-year
stud to whom he has surrendered the No. 1 offensive option, which
has allowed him to move from under the burden of carrying the
franchise.
</P>
<P>
   In the clincher, Robinson had 20 points and 10 rebounds, while
Duncan had 18 and 8. The Spurs can win when one scores 30 and the
other 10, and either can be the leader.
</P>
<P>
   It is a remarkable thing, watching two such agile athletes
redefine the traditional big man's game, and apparently without the
ego collisions that vex other double-star teams. The Blazers, as
the Lakers and Timberwolves before them, were helpless.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early on in the season, Tim and I weren't working together as
well on offense as we had the year before,'' he said. ``We had two
new people (Elie and Kersey) to work in, and we had no real
training camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``But after the slow start, (coach Greg Popovich) said we should
just quit trying to finesse things and go hard to the big guys.''
</P>
<P>
   The results have been apparent this spring. The Spurs are
winning in the playoffs by an average of nearly 10 points a game,
an almost Bull-like dominance that isn't likely to end against
either Eastern opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We said at the beginning of the playoffs that we were going to
get better and better,'' said Robinson, who after the game and
before the locker room doors opened, addressed the team with that
reminder.
</P>
<P>
   He also told his teammates how proud and pleased he was,
thanking everyone for a accepting roles avoiding the
finger-pointing after the slow start.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't say much about what this ascension meant to his
often-criticized career.
</P>
<P>
   Didn't have to. Anyone who knows the Admiral knows the scars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've enjoyed facing the trials _ I really have,'' he said.
``That's what gives me the drive and desire to figure how to get to
the Finals.''
</P>
<P>
   The fire is lit in Robinson. Scorch marks are all over the NBA.

SPURS SWEEP TRAIL BLAZERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. _ Their biggest mouthpiece, Isaiah Rider, sat
motionless in a corner at the end of the Portland Trail Blazers'
bench.
</P>
<P>
   His arms were crossed. His head lay between raised knees.
Presumably, his mind meandered into deep thought that moment in the
fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Rider and Blazermania had actually been silenced long before the
Spurs completed a series sweep with Sunday's 94-80 Game 4 victory.
</P>
<P>
   So, figuratively, that white towel around Rider's neck did not
need to be thrown on the Rose Garden floor. Much like they the
entire Western Conference finals, the determined San Antonio Spurs
snatched that away, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll probably go on to win it all,'' Rider said of the
Spurs. ``If they don't, they had a great series here.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to typical Rider remarks, that would be an
understatement.
</P>
<P>
   In advancing to the NBA Finals for the first time, the Spurs won
their 10 straight playoff game. They also became the first team to
sweep the conference semifinal and final rounds since the 1989
Lakers, who won 11 straight en route the league finals.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs, maintaining their stern we're-on-a-mission attitude
that got them this far, averted any elaborate postgame celebration.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have four more games before we can even think about
celebrating,'' Spurs point guard Avery Johnson said. ``We are
excited, but not overly excited. No one is going crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Evidently, the Spurs save their madness for the basketball
court.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most impressive is how methodically San Antonio pushed
aside the Blazers.
</P>
<P>
   Portland owned the league's best home record to this point
(27-3) but lost Games 3 and 4 to the Spurs by an average of 18
points. San Antonio won its sixth straight road game in the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just didn't bring it,'' Portland's Brian Grant said.
``Certain guys did, but when it was all said and done, their big
guys took away the middle and made it very difficult for us to do
anything right. Give them credit. They took it to us.''
</P>
<P>
   The deep and richly talented Blazers were overrun by a team
playing arguably the best basketball of those still standing.
Whichever wins the Eastern Conference finals, New York or Indiana,
should know that San Antonio is boiling over with confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``After going through the Western Conference playoffs, I feel
sorry for whoever comes out of the East,'' Spurs guard Mario Elie
said. ``We went through a hard road. We played three tough teams
and swept two of them (including the L.A. Lakers in the
semifinals). So you've got to give us a little credit.''
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio veteran David Robinson will settle for a
championship ring. It's taken him 10 seasons to get this far.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been 10 long years, but it's just what I imagined it
would be,'' said Robinson, who powered the Spurs with 20 points and
10 rebounds. ``We've grown a lot. I feel good about what we've
accomplished. Our steady play throughout the game gives us a mental
advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Spurs guard Steve Kerr, who won three titles with the
Chicago Bulls: ``I don't think I'll ever compare any team with
Michael Jordan on it, but this team is very mentally tough.''
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio won two close games at home in this series. Then,
after blowing out the Blazers in Game 3, the Spurs were immovable
Sunday. They withstood a fast start and led for most of 2{
quarters.
</P>
<P>
   After going ahead 12-11 in the first, Portland's only other lead
was 59-58 with 1:40 left in the third. And that was short-lived.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Duncan responded with a three-point play over Rasheed
Wallace, and San Antonio pulled away with a 20-6 run. Johnson's
19-footer put the Spurs in front 78-65 with 8:09 left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Portland's objective was to double team Duncan and Robinson. But
whenever the Blazers crowded San Antonio's post players, Robinson
and Duncan made quick, sharp passes to outside shooters. Outside
scoring from Kerr, Sean Elliott and Jaren Jackson picked Portland
apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bitter feeling,'' said Damon Stoudamire, who led
Portland with 21 points. ``It's rough. I cried. A couple of other
guys teared up, too. You want to remember the feeling and never let
it come back.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers, who had been the picture of poise in defeating Utah
in the second round, fell off the wall and cracked their frame in
this series. Their offense often regressed to one-on-one play,
which held the Blazers back as much as San Antonio's insistence on
closing down the paint.
</P>
<P>
   In light of constant player complaints about playing time and
on-court bickering, the Blazers were not together in the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a firm believer in bad thoughts and bad karma.
Unfortunately, we had some negative vibes seep into the mix,''
Blazers backup guard Greg Anthony said. ``It's obviously no secret
that we had issues. If you have other issues at hand, then those
sometimes will determine your fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing about their team is their chemistry and their
selflessness. Their objective was to win. That's all.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, all is said and done for these Blazers.

   PHOENIX _ AlliedSignal Inc. and Honeywell Inc. announced today
(Monday 12:01 a.m. EST) the two companies plan to combine in a
merger that would create the Valley's largest employer and the
world's largest supplier of aerospace components to the airline
industry.
</P>
<P>
   The new company, to be called Honeywell, would be based in
Morristown, N.J. The combined aerospace operations of the new
company would be based in Phoenix. The city is now home to both
AlliedSignal's and Honeywell's aerospace divisions.
</P>
<P>
   The new company's status as the Valley's largest employer might
be short-lived. A source close to the negotiations said there might
be a ``modest'' reduction in workforce within two years.
</P>
<P>
   AlliedSignal and Honeywell had been talking for five years,
looking for ways to create a leading manufacturer of avionics. The
deal was made at a time when both companies were at a crossroads.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence A. Bossidy, AlliedSignal's chairman and chief executive
officer, will be the new company's chairman. Honeywell chairman and
chief executive officer Michael Bonsignore will be the chief
executive officer and will assume the chairmanship when Bossidy
retires.
</P>
<P>
   Aerospace would be the new company's single largest business
segment, generating some $10 billion in revenue, Honeywell and
AlliedSignal said in a joint statement.
</P>
<P>
   The Honeywell name was retained to maintain the brand
recognition associated with the well-known maker of thermostats,
industrial controls and airline instrumentation.
</P>
<P>
   While it kept the old Honeywell name, the new Honeywell, whose
combined revenue is $25 million, will be based in Morristown, home
of AlliedSignal Inc., which makes airline engines, equipment,
systems and services.
</P>
<P>
   The all-stock merger, valued at $14 billion, is expected to
close in the fourth quarter of 1999, if it receives federal
regulatory approval. The new company will also assume approximately
$1.5 billion of Honeywell's debt.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the agreement, each share of Honeywell common
stock will be exchanged for 1.875 shares of AlliedSignal's common
stock. The companies anticipated the combined firm earnings per
share will have an immediate upside.
</P>
<P>
   But it is questionable, with a combined workforce of 17,500 in
the Valley, how long it will remain the No. 1 employer.
</P>
<P>
   The integrated Honeywell will have more than 120,000 employees
worldwide when the deal closes in October. According to the
statement, it will eliminate approximately 4,500 jobs throughout
the company within the first year and a half.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would expect the effect of the deal on Phoenix to be fairly
modest,'' said a source close to the negotiations. The exact number
of positions to be eliminated had not been determined, the source
said.
</P>
<P>
   AlliedSignal and Honeywell executives began negotiations again
in February after years of on-and-off talks. A source said the
companies' heads soon got serious.
</P>
<P>
   The timing appeared right because AlliedSignal had a succession
issue and Honeywell didn't want to become a small player in a
market where customers are outsourcing larger portions of the
aircraft, the source close to the negotiations said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The merger will ideally position the combined entity for
enhanced revenue and income growth,'' Bossidy said in the company's
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Bossidy will serve as chairman until his planned retirement on
April 1, 2000. Bossidy, 64, who was cited in the June 21 issue of``
Fortune'' magazine as one of ``today's best CEOs,'' will focus on
integrating the two companies.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the different markets AlliedSignal and Honeywell serve,
the source said, merging them should be easy because both have good
corporate cultures which are action-oriented.
</P>
<P>
   Bonsignore, 58, Honeywell's CEO, will be the the new company's
chief executive officer until Bossidy's retirement. At that time,
Bonsignore will assume the additional responsibilities of chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Robert D. Johnson, currently president and chief executive
officer of AlliedSignal's aerospace division will report to
Bonsignore.
</P>
<P>
   The merger sets up a new board of directors and a new management
team. The board includes nine members from the current AlliedSignal
board and six members from the current Honeywell board.
</P>
<P>
   Of the six key staff appointments, four are from AlliedSignal
and two are from Honeywell. None is based in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix Mayor Skip Rimsza was optimistic that any job loss would
be minimal and that other companies seeing Honeywell's commitment
to the Valley, might follow its lead and increase their business
presence in the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a tremendous number of businesses that may locate or
expand their presence in the Valley just to capitalize on the
support business a company of that size requires,'' Rimsza said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Before the merger AlliedSignal ranked No. 3 among the Valley's
largest employers, with approximately 10,000 workers.
</P>
<P>
   AlliedSignal has three facilities in the Valley: Its aerospace
division headquarters is at 34th and Washington streets. A
diversified manufacturer, AlliedSignal's aerospace division makes
collision-prevention and other safety instruments for aircraft. It
also has plants in Chandler and Tempe. AlliedSignal also employs
1,000 aerospace workers in Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   AlliedSignal's Arizona operations account for $5 billion in
revenue. It had revenue of $15 billion last year from sales of
automotive products, specialty chemicals and performance fibers.
</P>
<P>
   In Phoenix, Honeywell's operations represented just over half
its 1998 revenue of $8.4 billion. Two of its three businesses:
Industrial Control and Space and Aviation Control, which accounted
for $2.5 billion and $2.3 billion respectively, are headquartered
here. Between the two divisions it employs 7,500, placing it No. 11
among the largest employers in the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   A company news release projected that the combined company's
stock price will see an 8.8 percent increase over the next three
years. The new Honeywell's stock price is expected to rise 17 cents
per share in 2000 to 32 cents per share in 2002. &QL;

   Brain Storm
</P>
<P>
   By Richard Dooling. Picador USA, $14.
</P>
<P>
   The hero of this clever, densely packed thriller is a St. Louis
lawyer who is assigned to defend a despicable criminal and becomes
involved with a brain researcher with an explanation for
everything. ``Here is a whodunit that achieves a comic fugue-state
mastery of the language of our sexually charged, violent,
technocratic society,'' Colin Harrison wrote here last year.
</P>
<P>
   To End a War
</P>
<P>
   By Richard Holbrooke. Modern Library, $15.95.
</P>
<P>
   The American diplomat in charge of the 1995 Dayton peace
accords, which resulted in a halt in the fighting in Bosnia, tells
his story through anecdotes, withering strategic analysis and sharp
portraits of the wily Balkan leaders and timid NATO military
commanders involved in the talks. His ``engaging, witty and
dramatic account,'' which was selected by the editors of the Book
Review as one of the best books of 1998, is also ``an impassioned
plea for Washington to use the military might at its disposal to
intervene when societies break down,'' Chris Hedges wrote here last
year. In Blood and Vengeance: One Family's Story of the War in
Bosnia, by Chuck Sudetic (Penguin, $14.95), a Croatian-American
journalist who covered the war for The New York Times follows
several generations of a Muslim family near Srebrenica, where
Bosnian Serbs massacred several thousand Muslims in 1995. Last year
our reviewer, Tom Gjelten, called this ``a narrative so rich and
strong it not only describes the crime but dares to explain it and
does so with eloquence and dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   Bridget Jones's Diary
</P>
<P>
   By Helen Fielding. Penguin, $12.95.
</P>
<P>
   This comic novel follows a 30-something Brit who vows to lose
weight, control her drinking and basically get a grip on herself as
she struggles with demeaning dates and disastrous dinner parties.
``The book is a compilation of memorably silly moments in the life
of a hapless Everywoman,'' Elizabeth Gleick said here in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Hacienda: A Memoir
</P>
<P>
   By Lisa St. Aubin de Teran. Back Bay/Little, Brown, $13.
</P>
<P>
   The British author was 17 years old when she married an unstable
Venezuelan aristocrat and moved to his Andean estate. Out of her
nightmarish marriage came a 1982 novel, ``Keepers of the House,''
and this lyrical nonfiction account, which is also an affectionate
portrait of a lost world and its people. The result is ``a
transfixing performance,'' Michael Upchurch wrote here last year.
</P>
<P>
   Peyton Place
</P>
<P>
   By Grace Metalious. Northeastern University, $13.95.
</P>
<P>
   It may not seem as naughty today, but this lurid novel about a
New Hampshire town, with its deflowerings, suicides and other dark
goings-on, ruffled a lot of feathers when it was first published in
1956. ``Sinclair Lewis would no doubt have hailed Metalious as a
sister-in-arms against the ... bourgeois pretensions of allegedly
respectable communities,'' Carlos Baker wrote here.
</P>
<P>
   Tecumseh: A Life
</P>
<P>
   By John Sugden. John Macrae/Owl/Holt, $15.95.
</P>
<P>
   The great Indian leader was a proud, charismatic warrior who
envisioned a pan-Indian alliance and helped defeat an American
invasion of Canada during the War of 1812. Last year our reviewer,
Barry Gewen, called this ``a richly detailed, utterly scrupulous
account that is as poignant as it is informative _ for Tecumseh
seems to have been doomed from the start.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ibis Tapestry
</P>
<P>
   By Mike Nicol. Vintage International, $13.
</P>
<P>
   This novel's narrator is a South African writer who receives a
dead man's laptop computer and gets pulled into an underground
world of gunrunning. ```The Ibis Tapestry' plays skillfully with
truth and fiction to portray the landscape of a nation undergoing
revolutionary change,'' Erik Burns wrote here last year. Home
Ground, by Lynn Freed (Story Line, $14), focuses on a theater
family whose internal dramas provide a metaphor for apartheid-era
politics. ``What is extraordinary about this book is its
perspective,'' Janette Turner Hospital wrote here in 1986.
``Freed's guileless child-narrator takes us inside the neurosis''
of the country.
</P>
<P>
   The Last Voyage of the Karluk:
</P>
<P>
   A Survivor's Memoir of Arctic Disaster
</P>
<P>
   By William Laird McKinlay. St. Martin's Griffin, $12.95.
</P>
<P>
   The author was a meteorologist with a 1913 expedition to chart
the Arctic region that resulted in disaster: the ship sank early
on, and the few survivors were stranded on a barren island for six
months. In 1977 our reviewer, Alix Nelson, called this a tale
``written with a grace, modesty and power that are the measure of
the man.'' Ship of Gold in the Deep Blue Sea, by Gary Kinder
(Vintage, $14), chronicles the sinking of a gold-laden paddle
steamer in a hurricane off the Carolina coast in 1857 and the
effort in the 1980's to recover its treasure. ``The author writes
beautifully _ historical and technological reporting of a high
order, as suspenseful and deft about the doomed steamer as the
salvage vessels,'' John Maxtone-Graham wrote here last year.
</P>
<P>
   A World Away
</P>
<P>
   By Stewart O'Nan. Owl/Holt, $13.
</P>
<P>
   On Long Island circa 1943, a troubled family plays out its
summer of discontent, complete with adultery and an unraveling
marriage. Last year our reviewer, Timothy Foote, admired the
novel's ``intricately overlapping streams of consciousness that
rove back and forth, creating past and present with fleeting hints
about the characters' lives.''

(Repeating) (The Week in Review) 
(lb) 
 By SERGE SCHMEMANN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If the goal of the allied bombing of Yugoslavia was
to force Slobodan Milosevic to pull his troops out of Kosovo and
cede control of that unhappy province to NATO, it appears to have
been a success, and more _ a refutation of the common wisdom that
air power alone could never make a despot back down.
</P>
<P>
   But if the purpose was also to warn evildoers in other lands
that the United States and its allies now stand ready to enforce
peace with bombs, it is a message that has brought more concern
than comfort.
</P>
<P>
   From India to Israel to Indonesia, countries with their own
unresolved ethnic conflicts _ and they are of epidemic proportions
in the postcommunist universe _ have scrutinized the Balkan
conflict for some indication of how this might affect their own
fates.
</P>
<P>
   India, whose contested control of Kashmir has led in recent days
to new clashes with Pakistan and fierce clampdowns on the Muslim
population of the province, has been fiercely critical of
Washington and Brussels for presuming the right to interfere with
force in the internal affairs of a sovereign state.
</P>
<P>
   Israel, which prefers to see itself as a victim of Arab
aggression rather than an occupying power in lands along its
borders, has welcomed NATO's new assertiveness. One high Israeli
official happily reported that Israeli intelligence had noticed
that U.S. willingness to bomb Yugoslavia into submission had
stirred considerable discomfort among some despotic Arab leaders of
neighboring states.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it remains far from clear whether the capitulation of the
Serbs _ if, indeed, it is a capitulation and not another maneuver
by the wily Milosevic to gain time and consolidate his gains _
heralds the acceptance of a new global police mission by the West,
however bold the pronouncements and self-congratulation last week.
</P>
<P>
   From the outset, the United States and its NATO allies have
couched the bombardment of Yugoslavia in high moral terms, as a
crusade to restore the rights of a maligned population and to
prevent the spread of chaos beyond the borders of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   But all along, many experts and foreign leaders have questioned
whether the allies would have acted had Kosovo been in Central
Asia, and how much the operation really had a tightly focused
purpose _ to define the reach, the role and the credibility of NATO
and the United States in postcommunist Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Now new questions can be added to the mix: Does the apparent
success of the air war change the logic? Will a newly confident
West be tempted to expand its horizons? Should tyrants in far-flung
parts of the globe think a second time before unleashing mayhem?
</P>
<P>
   Graham Allison, head of the Belfer Center for Science and
International Affairs at Harvard, is among those who see the
bombing of Kosovo as a strictly European phenomenon. ``I think that
this was an accident, a combination of circumstances which
partially have to do with Europe, partly with NATO, partly with
guilt about the earlier Bosnia story, partly to do with the notion
that more things are doable in the European setting,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not likely to initiate a new messianic crusade,'' he
added, even though some people will inevitably ask why the West
doesn't take action ``when the next horror arises in Rwanda or
Indonesia.''
</P>
<P>
   The charges of selectivity have already been leveled, raising
the questions of where NATO was during the genocide in Rwanda, and
why it is complicit with Turkey's repression of the Kurds or
Indonesia's repression of separatists in East Timor, and why it has
kept silent about Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of NATO planes bombing Israel to get its troops out
of the West Bank, or Canada to free Quebec, or England to get it
out of Northern Ireland, has become the stuff of comedy routines
based on the inconsistencies of NATO's Kosovo rationale.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the fact is that separatist movements along ethnic and
religious lines and conflicts like the ones in the crumbling
Yugoslavia are likely to be the dominant problem of the near
future, and the temptation for interference by the West or other
powers will always be there.
</P>
<P>
   The notion that well-meaning nations can and should try to
jointly resolve conflicts has been a leitmotif of this century. The
creation of the League of Nations and the U.N. Security Council was
followed by various regional or individual efforts at peacekeeping,
including Syria's takeover of Lebanon with the consent of the Arab
League, Nigeria's efforts at stanching civil wars in West Africa,
and U.S. operations in Haiti, Somalia and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   One outgrowth of the Kosovo operation was the announcement last
week that the 15 members of the European Union intend to form their
own military force for such missions, freeing the United States of
at least part of the burden of playing global cop.
</P>
<P>
   But the peacemaking efforts have always been selective, and only
rarely successful. The Security Council has been wary of using its
powers to employ military force under the U.N. Charter. Most U.N.
peacekeeping missions have been created largely to formalize
agreements, and have lasted only so long as the warring parties
needed them.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO action on Kosovo marked a new approach. First, the
allies claimed the right to use force against a sovereign state
only because it refused to sign a proffered agreement. Second,
instead of sending in troops, NATO chose a campaign of
progressively more destructive bombing, thus sharply lowering the
chance of casualties among allied soldiers, and the resistance back
home that body bags provoke.
</P>
<P>
   However effective the approach in the immediate term, it has
also been the source of considerable irritation abroad, and
considerable uncertainty about the future. One accusation rarely
noted in the U.S. press, but extensively accepted as truth abroad,
was that the bombing of Yugoslavia was a flagrant violation of
sovereignty and international law. In the Third World, where
boundaries are often in dispute and governments weak, these
principles are held to be virtually sacred.
</P>
<P>
   Among other nations, most notably Russia, the entire campaign
has been perceived exclusively as a power play by NATO, with the
Kosovar Albanians only providing a pretext. Coupled with the
expansion of NATO, the campaign has seriously lowered the standing
of the United States in Russian eyes.
</P>
<P>
   So the diplomatic costs of repeating the exercise too often
would be high, even if the prospects of military success were good.

   But if the purpose was also to warn evildoers in other lands
that the United States and its allies now stand ready to enforce
peace with bombs, it is a message that has brought more concern
than comfort.
</P>
<P>
   From India to Israel to Indonesia, countries with their own
unresolved ethnic conflicts _ and they are of epidemic proportions
in the postcommunist universe _ have scrutinized the Balkan
conflict for some indication of how this might affect their own
fates.
</P>
<P>
   India, whose contested control of Kashmir has led in recent days
to new clashes with Pakistan and fierce clampdowns on the Muslim
population of the province, has been fiercely critical of
Washington and Brussels for presuming the right to interfere with
force in the internal affairs of a sovereign state.
</P>
<P>
   Israel, which prefers to see itself as a victim of Arab
aggression rather than an occupying power in lands along its
borders, has welcomed NATO's new assertiveness. One high Israeli
official happily reported that Israeli intelligence had noticed
that U.S. willingness to bomb Yugoslavia into submission had
stirred considerable discomfort among some despotic Arab leaders of
neighboring states.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it remains far from clear whether the capitulation of the
Serbs _ if, indeed, it is a capitulation and not another maneuver
by the wily Milosevic to gain time and consolidate his gains _
heralds the acceptance of a new global police mission by the West,
however bold the pronouncements and self-congratulation last week.
</P>
<P>
   From the outset, the United States and its NATO allies have
couched the bombardment of Yugoslavia in high moral terms, as a
crusade to restore the rights of a maligned population and to
prevent the spread of chaos beyond the borders of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   But all along, many experts and foreign leaders have questioned
whether the allies would have acted had Kosovo been in Central
Asia, and how much the operation really had a tightly focused
purpose _ to define the reach, the role and the credibility of NATO
and the United States in postcommunist Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Now new questions can be added to the mix: Does the apparent
success of the air war change the logic? Will a newly confident
West be tempted to expand its horizons? Should tyrants in far-flung
parts of the globe think a second time before unleashing mayhem?
</P>
<P>
   Graham Allison, head of the Belfer Center for Science and
International Affairs at Harvard, is among those who see the
bombing of Kosovo as a strictly European phenomenon. ``I think that
this was an accident, a combination of circumstances which
partially have to do with Europe, partly with NATO, partly with
guilt about the earlier Bosnia story, partly to do with the notion
that more things are doable in the European setting,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not likely to initiate a new messianic crusade,'' he
added, even though some people will inevitably ask why the West
doesn't take action ``when the next horror arises in Rwanda or
Indonesia.''
</P>
<P>
   The charges of selectivity have already been leveled, raising
the questions of where NATO was during the genocide in Rwanda, and
why it is complicit with Turkey's repression of the Kurds or
Indonesia's repression of separatists in East Timor, and why it has
kept silent about Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of NATO planes bombing Israel to get its troops out
of the West Bank, or Canada to free Quebec, or England to get it
out of Northern Ireland, has become the stuff of comedy routines
based on the inconsistencies of NATO's Kosovo rationale.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the fact is that separatist movements along ethnic and
religious lines and conflicts like the ones in the crumbling
Yugoslavia are likely to be the dominant problem of the near
future, and the temptation for interference by the West or other
powers will always be there.
</P>
<P>
   The notion that well-meaning nations can and should try to
jointly resolve conflicts has been a leitmotif of this century. The
creation of the League of Nations and the U.N. Security Council was
followed by various regional or individual efforts at peacekeeping,
including Syria's takeover of Lebanon with the consent of the Arab
League, Nigeria's efforts at stanching civil wars in West Africa,
and U.S. operations in Haiti, Somalia and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   One outgrowth of the Kosovo operation was the announcement last
week that the 15 members of the European Union intend to form their
own military force for such missions, freeing the United States of
at least part of the burden of playing global cop.
</P>
<P>
   But the peacemaking efforts have always been selective, and only
rarely successful. The Security Council has been wary of using its
powers to employ military force under the U.N. Charter. Most U.N.
peacekeeping missions have been created largely to formalize
agreements, and have lasted only so long as the warring parties
needed them.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO action on Kosovo marked a new approach. First, the
allies claimed the right to use force against a sovereign state
only because it refused to sign a proffered agreement. Second,
instead of sending in troops, NATO chose a campaign of
progressively more destructive bombing, thus sharply lowering the
chance of casualties among allied soldiers, and the resistance back
home that body bags provoke.
</P>
<P>
   However effective the approach in the immediate term, it has
also been the source of considerable irritation abroad, and
considerable uncertainty about the future. One accusation rarely
noted in the U.S. press, but extensively accepted as truth abroad,
was that the bombing of Yugoslavia was a flagrant violation of
sovereignty and international law. In the Third World, where
boundaries are often in dispute and governments weak, these
principles are held to be virtually sacred.
</P>
<P>
   Among other nations, most notably Russia, the entire campaign
has been perceived exclusively as a power play by NATO, with the
Kosovar Albanians only providing a pretext. Coupled with the
expansion of NATO, the campaign has seriously lowered the standing
of the United States in Russian eyes.
</P>
<P>
   So the diplomatic costs of repeating the exercise too often
would be high, even if the prospects of military success were good.

</P>
<P>
   In addition, there is a sense among U.S. and foreign analysts
that even if the Kosovo operation did achieve its aims, it did so
at an exorbitant cost in armaments and destruction. A million
Kosovars were homeless, Serbia's economy lay in ruins, and
thousands of Serbs and Albanians were dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just overwhelmed them with destruction,'' said Earl Tilford
Jr., a former Air Force officer who now teaches at the Army War
College. ``It was technically excellent, but strategically
bankrupt.'' The question this poses elsewhere, of course, is how
many times the West will have the stomach to repeat the destruction
and the resources to repair the mess afterward.
</P>
<P>
   There was also the fact that having entered Bosnia and now
Kosovo, the United States is likely to remain mired in the south
Balkans for a generation. It is not the kind of garrison duty
likely to be repeated in too many places.
</P>
<P>
   And there are also doubts about the effectiveness of the Kosovo
operation as a deterrent. ``Does this mean that the next bad man,
whether an African potentate or someone in Asia or even Uzbekistan,
is going to think, `Oh my God, here they come?' I don't think so,''
said Allison. ``It wouldn't significantly affect the calculus,
though it would at least demonstrate what could happen.''
</P>
<P>
   What may happen, argued Susan Woodward, an expert on the Balkans
at the Brookings Institution, is that dictators or even troubled
countries, fearing that their internal conflicts make them ripe
targets for a NATO onslaught and unable to resist it with
conventional arms, will be tempted to turn to nuclear or chemical
arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will not say, `I will think twice before I do horrible
things,''' Ms. Woodward said. ``Rather they will think, `I better
prepare better defensively against external interventions of that
kind.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not comfortable with the argument that if we compromised
we would lose our credibility,'' said Dmitri Simes, head of the
Nixon Center in Washington. ``That's not the kind of credibility we
need. Everybody understands that the United States, especially with
NATO, is a global force. We have to understand how different our
actions look elsewhere.''

   Here's another story about the United States' out-of-control
courts: Southern Pacific Railroad was so besieged by frivolous
lawsuits in one Texas county that it ripped up 28 miles of track
and shut down operations in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Like similar anecdotes in almost every state, the tale of the
disgusted railroad has been repeated for years in Texas. It even
made its way into a conservative research center's report as proof
of what most people believe anyway: Havoc is being wreaked and jobs
lost by an irrational legal system.
</P>
<P>
   But, like many legal horror stories, it may not have been 100
percent true. ``It was kind of a coincidence of timing,'' said Mark
Davis, a spokesman for Union Pacific, which merged with Southern
Pacific in 1996. ``Southern Pacific was studying that line to be
abandoned anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, across the country, accounts of bizarre jury verdicts
and huge damage awards (like the $2.9 million collected by the
McDonald's customer who spilled coffee on herself) have been used
to prove that the courts are wacky or worse. But increasingly, some
political scientists, legal scholars and consumer advocates are
suggesting that outlandish examples have created a distorted
picture of the legal system.
</P>
<P>
   Huge punitive damage awards, for example, have become everyday
events, right? Actually, a study of courts in the nation's 75
largest counties conducted by the National Center for State Courts
found that only 364 of 762,000 cases ended in punitive damages, or
0.047 percent.
</P>
<P>
   OK, but isn't it true that more and more liability claims are
filed every year? Actually, a study of 16 states by the same center
showed that the number of liability suits has declined by 9 percent
since 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Well, didn't that McDonald's coffee drinker laugh all the way to
the bank? Maybe, but she was 81 years old, the coffee was scalding
and she needed skin grafts for third-degree burns. And she settled
for about $600,000 after a judge reduced the jury award.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Galanter, a law professor at the University of Wisconsin,
described these popular stories about the courts as ``legal
legends,'' in the Arizona Law Review last year. The label is
sticking and some scholars and consumer advocates are starting to
systematically challenge their accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   They say legends like the one about the Texas railroad have been
used to maximum effect by a national business-supported movement to
make it harder for plaintiffs to win lawsuits under tort law, which
governs civil injury claims.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, the Alabama Legislature passed sweeping tort law
changes, including a bill that would put a cap on punitive damages
awarded by juries. Virtually every state has considered similar
measures since the mid-1980s, and most have passed some measures to
limit lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The story of tort reform across the country is that it is one
of the most carefully developed and exquisitely executed political
campaigns ever,'' said Andrew Popper, a law professor at American
University in Washington who is an expert on personal injury law
and identifies himself as a supporter of consumer rights.
</P>
<P>
   One advocate's distortion, of course, is another's innocent
spin. David Shaffer, president of the Public Policy Institute, a
New York business group pushing for lawsuit limits in New York,
said examples of ostensible outrages are used by consumer advocates
as well as business groups. ``It's done on both sides,'' he said.
``The trial lawyers drag in pictures portraying some person who has
been a victim of a terrible accident.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if there are occasional exaggerations, some business
lobbyists say, there are enough large verdicts to intimidate
corporations into large settlements and to inhibit innovation by
making companies fearful of bringing out new products that might
attract lawsuits. The possibility of huge jury awards and the
expense of battling suits, they say, combine to keep useful
products off consumers' shelves.
</P>
<P>
   But some lawyers and academics argue that consistently
far-fetched accounts of court rulings have warped the debate about
the legal system. And shrewd public relations by business and other
groups pushing to limit lawsuits may be only part of the reason.
</P>
<P>
   Unusual or big verdicts make news, said Michael McCann, a
political science professor at the University of Washington. McCann
and William Haltom of the University of Puget Sound in Tacoma,
Wash., found in a study that the large McDonald's verdict got
extensive front-page coverage in 1994. But only about half the
newspapers carried articles when the judge later reduced the
punitive damages to $480,000.
</P>
<P>
   In similar research, Oscar Chase, a law professor at New York
University, found in a survey of cases in the New York area that
the average verdict reported by The New York Times in 1989 was
$20.5 million. But including the much larger number of cases that
did not attract media attention, the average verdict was really
$1.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Policy-makers,'' Chase said in an interview, ``can't reliably
use their impressions from reading the press about issues like
whether the court system is out of control.''

<P>
   The problem, some legal experts say, is that policy-makers do
rely on such impressions. In his law review article, Galanter
traced the long afterlife of an infamous 1986 case involving a
Philadelphia psychic who won a $1 million verdict. She had claimed
she had an allergic reaction to medical treatment and lost her
psychic powers.
</P>
<P>
   The story of the psychic's verdict was widely circulated.
Eventually, Galanter learned, it found its way into a 1991 report
of the President's Council on Competitiveness, which referred to
such bizarre cases as ``almost commonplace'' but did not disclose
that the psychic's verdict had been reversed and that she had
collected nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Business groups say they are at a disadvantage in a public
relations war that often spotlights alarming accounts of supposedly
risky products, dangerous drugs and cancer-causing chemicals.
``Emotions are stirred more when people are frightened for their
own safety than they are by large damage awards that are not going
to be paid out of their own money,'' said Victor Schwartz, a
Washington lawyer who lobbies for businesses on tort issues.
</P>
<P>
   But consumer groups say accounts of ostensible outrages in the
courts seem more methodically misleading than reports about product
dangers. A recent report by Citizens for Corporate Accountability
and Individual Rights, a New York consumer group, said the Public
Policy Institute had ``misreported and misused'' every case it
described in its efforts to show that the New York courts were out
of control.
</P>
<P>
   ``They usually don't mention that the defendant did anything
wrong,'' said the consumer group's executive director, Joanne
Doroshow, a former associate of Ralph Nader.
</P>
<P>
   One supposedly outrageous case the Institute cited in a report
last year involved an award of $650,000 given by New York City to
the family of a drunk driver who was killed in an accident while
driving the wrong way on a parkway. The Institute did not disclose
that the court said the city's signs ``virtually invited wrong-way
entry,'' the consumer group said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the report was misleading, Shaffer of the Public
Policy Institute said anecdotes were less important than the
harmful impact of the overall legal system on corporate innovation.
``It is impossible,'' he added, ``to include complete information
about everything.''
</P>
<P>
   True or false, legal legends do make effective debating points.
In a series of interviews recently in Texas, several leaders of a
movement to end ``lawsuit abuse'' mentioned the case of the
railroad that abandoned Matagorda County in Texas because of
excessive lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Weekley, a Houston businessman who is a leader of Texans
for Lawsuit Reform, said in a recent interview that he had used the
railroad story for years in speeches as an example of legal
craziness. Audiences are horrified, he said. ``People sit there and
say, `Why is a railroad tearing up 28 miles of track?''' Weekley
said.
</P>
<P>
   In response to an inquiry from a reporter, Davis, the railroad
spokesman, said ``Litigation was last on the totem pole'' among
reasons for ceasing operations in Matagorda County. ``Traffic was
down to one freight car a year.''

   But consumer groups say accounts of ostensible outrages in the
courts seem more methodically misleading than reports about product
dangers. A recent report by Citizens for Corporate Accountability
and Individual Rights, a New York consumer group, said the Public
Policy Institute had ``misreported and misused'' every case it
described in its efforts to show that the New York courts were out
of control.
</P>
<P>
   ``They usually don't mention that the defendant did anything
wrong,'' said the consumer group's executive director, Joanne
Doroshow, a former associate of Ralph Nader.
</P>
<P>
   One supposedly outrageous case the Institute cited in a report
last year involved an award of $650,000 given by New York City to
the family of a drunk driver who was killed in an accident while
driving the wrong way on a parkway. The Institute did not disclose
that the court said the city's signs ``virtually invited wrong-way
entry,'' the consumer group said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the report was misleading, Shaffer of the Public
Policy Institute said anecdotes were less important than the
harmful impact of the overall legal system on corporate innovation.
``It is impossible,'' he added, ``to include complete information
about everything.''
</P>
<P>
   True or false, legal legends do make effective debating points.
In a series of interviews recently in Texas, several leaders of a
movement to end ``lawsuit abuse'' mentioned the case of the
railroad that abandoned Matagorda County in Texas because of
excessive lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Weekley, a Houston businessman who is a leader of Texans
for Lawsuit Reform, said in a recent interview that he had used the
railroad story for years in speeches as an example of legal
craziness. Audiences are horrified, he said. ``People sit there and
say, `Why is a railroad tearing up 28 miles of track?''' Weekley
said.
</P>
<P>
   In response to an inquiry from a reporter, Davis, the railroad
spokesman, said ``Litigation was last on the totem pole'' among
reasons for ceasing operations in Matagorda County. ``Traffic was
down to one freight car a year.''

MENTAL ILLNESS HITS THE MONEY TRAIL 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating) (The Week in Review) 
(lb) 
 By JOE SHARKEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shouldn't people with mental illnesses, which can destroy lives
and families, be entitled to the same amount of insurance coverage
as those with physical illnesses? On the face of it, that sounds
like a fairly simple question.
</P>
<P>
   But as in all things having to do with health care, and
especially the often vaguely defined area of mental illness, the
issue can be maddeningly complicated.
</P>
<P>
   Tipper Gore, the wife of the vice president, will open a White
House conference on Monday to draft new health-care policies that
would require employers and insurers to provide coverage for
outpatient and inpatient mental health comparable to that for other
kinds of medical care _ ``parity for all,'' in the words of Mrs.
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Along with similar proposals pending in Congress, the White
House initiative would face head-on what Mrs. Gore, who has a
master's degree in psychology, calls the destructive myth that
those seeking greater mental health coverage are ``out to rip off
the system.''
</P>
<P>
   At stake is a significant slice of the total U.S. health-care
budget. About $80 billion _ nearly 10 percent of total annual
health-care spending _ now goes into mental-health treatment,
according to the Center for Mental Health Services, a federal
research agency.
</P>
<P>
   About a third of that amount, mostly from Medicaid, Medicare and
other government sources, pays for clinical treatment of the
severely mentally ill, whose illnesses often render them poor and
unemployed and who often ``end up in the public system,'' according
to Mary Rappaport, a spokeswoman for the National Alliance for the
Mentally Ill, an advocacy group for the severely mentally ill.
</P>
<P>
   In any year, according to the group, about 5 million Americans
suffer from severe and persistent mental disorders, including
schizophrenia, bipolar disorders and major depression.
</P>
<P>
   Few seriously question the need for clinical treatment for those
with the worst mental illnesses, about 250,000 of whom are
homeless. So the debate over the potential cost of providing
comparable insurance coverage for mental and physical illnesses is
focused on those whose treatment consumes the remaining two-thirds
of the $80 billion total, most of which is paid by
employer-provided health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   This segment includes the ``worried well,'' as they are called
by those who question the employment of psychiatric therapy to
address many less severe emotional distresses and addiction
problems. For the past 25 years, most of the increases in
mental-health spending have gone to this group of patients, who are
the easiest and most profitable to treat.
</P>
<P>
   Proposed federal laws to establish comparable insurance coverage
for mental illness seek to give priority to the severely ill. But
some employers and policy analysts worry that once mandates for
expanded mental-health coverage are in place, costs could rise
sharply above the modest levels projected by the drafters of the
parity bills. The concern is that the legislation would provide
profit incentives to tailor diagnoses and to recruit new pools of
patients.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of comparable insurance coverage cite studies showing
that the additional cost would be minimal, while providing a major
public-health benefit. The National Institute of Mental Health
predicts that mandating parity through managed-care plans would add
less than 1 percent to the total annual national health-care bill.
</P>
<P>
   But such studies could be flawed by ``very low assumptions on
induced demand,'' said Paul Fronstin, a senior researcher at the
Employee Benefit Research Institute, whose clients include
employers, labor unions and pension plans. ``Induced demand''
refers to marketing by the mental-health industry, usually among
patients with health insurance who can be successfully treated for
a wide array of mental disorders defined in the American
Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual.
</P>
<P>
   For employers and others worried about potential cost increases
in mental-health therapy, induced demand raises a red flag. In the
late 1980s, when expanded psychiatric and substance-abuse therapy
was heavily promoted and advertised among the general population,
annual costs for such treatments rose 20 percent to 30 percent
faster than costs in other areas of health care, employers found.
</P>
<P>
   Fraud also became a problem. In the early 1990s, for-profit
psychiatric hospitals and addiction centers paid over $500 million
in federal fines to settle charges of profiteering and diagnostic
fraud in recruiting patients with generous mental-health insurance.
Many health-maintenance organizations responded by tightening
benefits for inpatient hospitalization and other mental-health
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, advocates for comparable insurance coverage cite
evidence that they say shows that more money is needed for
additional mental-health treatment:
</P>
<P>
   _ In any year 30 million Americans suffer from clinical mental
disorders, but only about 20 percent currently seek treatment,
according to studies cited by the National Institute of Mental
Health.
</P>
<P>
   _ According to the American Society of Addiction Medicine, 11.3
percent of Americans will at some point require psychiatric
treatment for various addictions. In an April report, the group
called for more spending on addiction therapy.
</P>
<P>
   _ The National Institute of Mental Health recently launched a
national television and radio advertising campaign to encourage
more people to seek treatment for anxiety disorders, which the
agency describes as ``frightening mental illnesses'' affecting 19
million Americans.
</P>
<P>
   _ The National Alliance for the Mentally Ill cites studies
asserting that of the nation's 63 million youths under 18, about
7.5 million have diagnosable mental disorders _ but only about a
fifth now receive treatment.
</P>
<P>
   _ Post-traumatic stress disorder, which is prompted by memories
of traumatic events, is now widely diagnosed among victims and
witnesses of crimes, natural disasters and even marital problems.
The National Institute of Mental Health estimates that 4 percent of
the population suffers from it. But that number could grow. The
Justice Department recently stated that some people who are
swindled by telemarketing fraud and other white-collar crimes
develop post-traumatic stress disorder and require psychiatric
intervention.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Police departments across the country refer officers with
troubling memories to therapists who specialize in treating
post-traumatic stress disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Robert Volpe, the father of Justin Volpe, the New
York City police officer who pleaded guilty to savagely assaulting
a suspect in a precinct bathroom, employed the sort of therapeutic
language found on Internet sites devoted to police post-traumatic
stress disorder to defend his son. He likened police work to combat
and suggested that his son suffered memories of traumatic
experiences on the job.
</P>
<P>
   As a diagnosis, post-traumatic stress disorder ``just started
taking off in 1985 and it keeps growing,'' said Allan Young,
chairman of the department of Social Studies of Medicine,
Anthropology and Psychiatry at McGill University in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   If the pool of patients grows and parity laws require insurers
to pay for all demands for treatment, something will have to give,
experts say. A 1997 study by the Employee Benefit Research
Institute warned that as mental-health parity causes employer costs
to rise, workers can expect to see erosion in other benefits, and
that some employers could react by dropping health-insurance
coverage altogether.
</P>
<P>
   The correct approach, said Ms. Rappaport of the National
Alliance for the Mentally Ill, is ``redirecting money already in
the system for those who have the most severe disorders.''
</P>
<P>
   The priority is simple, she said: ``You save the neediest
first.''

<P>
   As he struts along the basketball sidelines, screaming out plays
while wearing a Giorgio Armani suit, P.J. Carlesimo feels blessed.
But sometimes he also feels foolish.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of nights when you're sweating through a $2,000
suit that you kind of wonder why you're wearing a shirt and tie,''
said Carlesimo, coach of the Golden State Warriors. ``I think the
baseball managers and football coaches are smarter than basketball
coaches.''
</P>
<P>
   Fans watching the National Basketball Association playoffs this
weekend will no doubt note the visual disconnect between the baggy
jerseys of perspiring players engaged in grueling competition and
the sleek suits of coaches equally focused on the game. Carlesimo,
whose team failed to make the playoffs and whose wardrobe is
strictly Saks Fifth Avenue, makes it look good.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, NBA coaches are widely considered to be the best
dressed in the world, as these things go. While their counterparts
in the National Football League and major-league baseball wear
warm-up jackets, baseball caps and, in the case of baseball
managers, team uniforms, the coaches in the media-savvy NBA wear
suits by some of the most trend-setting designers on the market.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Riley of the Miami Heat has his Armani suits and sports
coats shipped directly from Italy. Chuck Daly, who recently retired
from the Orlando Magic, sat on the bench in the finely finished
fabrics of Hugo Boss and Ermenegildo Zegna, and the relatively
diminutive Mike Fratello, a veteran of 13 NBA seasons, is one of
the league's most exciting sideline personalities, mostly because
of his antics and his fashion flair. Fratello, who was dismissed
last week by the Cleveland Cavaliers, favored Boss.
</P>
<P>
   When Carlesimo left Seton Hall and entered the league five years
ago, he had no choice but to trade up in his clothing. Upon signing
to coach the Portland Trail Blazers, he was notified that one of
the team's sponsors, a local clothing store, wanted to outfit him
in Donna Karan (whose line President Clinton has been known to
wear).
</P>
<P>
   Now at Golden State, he has an agreement with Saks Fifth Avenue
that calls for him to dress in Armani or Zegna throughout the
season. While Carlesimo appreciates his good fortune, he says that
dressing to the nines is not necessarily practical.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd prefer to coach in what we wear at practice, which would
be closer to what NFL coaches wear in good weather _ a coaching
shirt and slacks,'' Carlesimo said. ``But I think that it has
become an image thing in the NBA and that it's going to be
difficult to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Because their game is played indoors, NBA coaches have always
worn suits. But it was not until the mid-1980s that many of them
started paying attention to the label inside their clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Don Casey, an NBA assistant coach for 18 years, said the shift
began when David Stern became the league's commissioner and
embarked on what has become the greatest mass-marketing campaign in
the history of professional sports. As the league gained fame and
an international following, the top players and coaches became
celebrities. The media began to take note of what the coaches were
wearing as they glowered or exploded or sat catatonic on the
sidelines.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``They didn't dress like that in the '60s and '70s,'' said
Casey, who during his brief stint as the head coach of the Los
Angeles Clippers was viewed as one of the league's worst-dressed
coaches in his lackluster suits and ties. ``The coaches were just
people coaching the game, but when national TV came in, the coaches
started becoming entities and looking professional and like _
you're on Wall Street _ came the look.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley, who wore Armani while leading the Los Angeles Lakers to
four championships during the 1980s, and Daly, who became a dapper
dresser while coaching in Detroit, are considered to be the
pioneers of the current trend. While other coaches were wearing
cotton-blend shirts and polyester ties, Riley and Daly were walking
the court in shoes handmade by Bally and suits worth thousands of
dollars. Now, many of the league's coaches, armed with lucrative
clothing deals of their own, can match the Riley look.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say that now there's that pressure to keep up with the
Joneses,'' Casey said. ``Still, sometimes I don't feel like wearing
a tie.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Summer is blockbuster season, from the multiplex to
the august halls of culture. That's one way to explain a big van
Gogh show at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Or ``Impressionists in
Winter,'' the first exhibition to assemble the snowscapes of Monet,
Renoir, Gauguin and others, served up by the Brooklyn Museum of Art
in the city's hottest months.
</P>
<P>
   Museums may shun comparisons with Hollywood but they, too,
strive for that explosion of interest (named for a super-powerful
World War II bomb) that spells ``blockbuster,'' filling the
coffers, swelling the membership rolls and exciting envy at fellow
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Museums have discovered advertising,'' said David Ross,
director of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and former
director of the Whitney Museum of American Art. ``You can advertise
garbage and make millions. Imagine if you advertise something with
real value.''
</P>
<P>
   With Americans flocking to art museums in record numbers, such
hits _ shows that seize you by the lapels and bellow, ``What! You
haven't lined up for `The Treasury of Saint Francis of Assisi'
yet?'' _ lend a gloss and urgency to art, science and history,
while posing questions about commercialism and exploitation.
</P>
<P>
   Eyebrows in the museum world arched last December when Ben
Hartley, director of communications and sponsorship for the Solomon
R. Guggenheim Museum in New York, said, ``We are in the
entertainment business and competing against other forms of
entertainment out there.'' The Guggenheim reached blockbuster
nirvana with its show on motorcycles, which drew half a million
visitors.
</P>
<P>
   But blockbusters have their defenders. ``These great moments of
acute interest create exceptional teaching opportunities,'' said
Ellen Futter, director of the Museum of Natural History, whose show
``Epidemic!'' on infectious diseases, has drawn more than 150,000
visitors since Feb. 27. ``They create a gateway to learning.''
</P>
<P>
   Museum calendars are replete with big exhibitions of plainly
blockbuster ambitions _ shows on Ingres' portraiture, the age of
the Pyramids, new archaeological finds from China and the
ever-popular impressionists, truly the museum world's most reliable
moneymakers.
</P>
<P>
   The Met weighed in last month with ``Cezanne to van Gogh,''
featuring the renowned collection of van Gogh's physician, Dr.
Paul-Ferdinand Gachet. ``I don't sit around thinking what will
bring in crowds,'' said Philippe de Montebello, who after two
decades as director was recently elevated to chief executive
officer as well.
</P>
<P>
   The Brooklyn Museum of Art days later opened its
``Impressionists in Winter,'' lauded by the museum's director,
Arnold Lehman, as ``literally the coolest show.''
</P>
<P>
   A show last year at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, ``Monet
in the 20th Century,'' became the most popular in the country in
1998, drawing nearly 566,000 visitors. The recent Jackson Pollock
show at the Museum of Modern Art in New York also proved a bonanza,
drawing nearly 330,000 visitors, a striking number, if still short
of the 940,000 _ more than 8,000 a day _ who swamped the museum's
Matisse show of 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The John Singer Sargent show, which closed last week at the
National Gallery in Washington, drew about 425,000 visitors, or
nearly 4,500 a day, catapulting it into the realm of the smash 1995
Vermeer show, said Dodge Thompson, the chief of exhibitions.

   The modern age of blockbusters arrived with a sensational show
in 1948. With the museums of war-shattered Germany in ruins and
many of their treasures recovered by the Allies from salt mines and
other caches, the U.S. authorities shipped 202 masterpieces to the
National Gallery for exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   Called simply ``Paintings From the Berlin Museums,'' the show,
with its Rembrandts, Vermeers, Titians, Duerers, van Eycks,
Botticellis, Breughels and a Bosch, drew near-riotous crowds. The
intense interest and short run of just 40 days, made for the
unprecedented arithmetic of an average 24,124 visitors a day.
</P>
<P>
   When the Louvre's Mona Lisa went on view at the National Gallery
in 1963, it drew an average daily attendance of more than 19,200,
for a total of 518,525.
</P>
<P>
   In overall numbers, the Met may hold the modern record, with
more than 1.2 million visitors to its ``Treasures of Tutankhamun''
of 1978 to '79.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the bigger blockbusters on the horizon may not really be
blockbusters at all, but permanent installations. The new Gottesman
Hall of Planet Earth opens at the Museum of Natural History on June
12, the first stage of the spherical Rose Center for Earth and
Space to be unveiled early next year, replacing the old
planetarium.
</P>
<P>
   In April, the Met opened its new Greek Galleries in a soaring
barrel-vaulted space hemmed in since World War II, drawing throngs
of visitors tabulated at more than 10,000 a day, until guards gave
up counting.

   As he struts along the basketball sidelines, screaming out plays
while wearing a Giorgio Armani suit, P.J. Carlesimo feels blessed.
But sometimes he also feels foolish.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of nights when you're sweating through a $2,000
suit that you kind of wonder why you're wearing a shirt and tie,''
said Carlesimo, coach of the Golden State Warriors. ``I think the
baseball managers and football coaches are smarter than basketball
coaches.''
</P>
<P>
   Fans watching the National Basketball Association playoffs this
weekend will no doubt note the visual disconnect between the baggy
jerseys of perspiring players engaged in grueling competition and
the sleek suits of coaches equally focused on the game. Carlesimo,
whose team failed to make the playoffs and whose wardrobe is
strictly Saks Fifth Avenue, makes it look good.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, NBA coaches are widely considered to be the best
dressed in the world, as these things go. While their counterparts
in the National Football League and major-league baseball wear
warm-up jackets, baseball caps and, in the case of baseball
managers, team uniforms, the coaches in the media-savvy NBA wear
suits by some of the most trend-setting designers on the market.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Riley of the Miami Heat has his Armani suits and sports
coats shipped directly from Italy. Chuck Daly, who recently retired
from the Orlando Magic, sat on the bench in the finely finished
fabrics of Hugo Boss and Ermenegildo Zegna, and the relatively
diminutive Mike Fratello, a veteran of 13 NBA seasons, is one of
the league's most exciting sideline personalities, mostly because
of his antics and his fashion flair. Fratello, who was dismissed
last week by the Cleveland Cavaliers, favored Boss.
</P>
<P>
   When Carlesimo left Seton Hall and entered the league five years
ago, he had no choice but to trade up in his clothing. Upon signing
to coach the Portland Trail Blazers, he was notified that one of
the team's sponsors, a local clothing store, wanted to outfit him
in Donna Karan (whose line President Clinton has been known to
wear).
</P>
<P>
   Now at Golden State, he has an agreement with Saks Fifth Avenue
that calls for him to dress in Armani or Zegna throughout the
season. While Carlesimo appreciates his good fortune, he says that
dressing to the nines is not necessarily practical.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd prefer to coach in what we wear at practice, which would
be closer to what NFL coaches wear in good weather _ a coaching
shirt and slacks,'' Carlesimo said. ``But I think that it has
become an image thing in the NBA and that it's going to be
difficult to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Because their game is played indoors, NBA coaches have always
worn suits. But it was not until the mid-1980s that many of them
started paying attention to the label inside their clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Don Casey, an NBA assistant coach for 18 years, said the shift
began when David Stern became the league's commissioner and
embarked on what has become the greatest mass-marketing campaign in
the history of professional sports. As the league gained fame and
an international following, the top players and coaches became
celebrities. The media began to take note of what the coaches were
wearing as they glowered or exploded or sat catatonic on the
sidelines.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``They didn't dress like that in the '60s and '70s,'' said
Casey, who during his brief stint as the head coach of the Los
Angeles Clippers was viewed as one of the league's worst-dressed
coaches in his lackluster suits and ties. ``The coaches were just
people coaching the game, but when national TV came in, the coaches
started becoming entities and looking professional and like _
you're on Wall Street _ came the look.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley, who wore Armani while leading the Los Angeles Lakers to
four championships during the 1980s, and Daly, who became a dapper
dresser while coaching in Detroit, are considered to be the
pioneers of the current trend. While other coaches were wearing
cotton-blend shirts and polyester ties, Riley and Daly were walking
the court in shoes handmade by Bally and suits worth thousands of
dollars. Now, many of the league's coaches, armed with lucrative
clothing deals of their own, can match the Riley look.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say that now there's that pressure to keep up with the
Joneses,'' Casey said. ``Still, sometimes I don't feel like wearing
a tie.''

   NEW YORK _ Summer is blockbuster season, from the multiplex to
the august halls of culture. That's one way to explain a big van
Gogh show at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Or ``Impressionists in
Winter,'' the first exhibition to assemble the snowscapes of Monet,
Renoir, Gauguin and others, served up by the Brooklyn Museum of Art
in the city's hottest months.
</P>
<P>
   Museums may shun comparisons with Hollywood but they, too,
strive for that explosion of interest (named for a super-powerful
World War II bomb) that spells ``blockbuster,'' filling the
coffers, swelling the membership rolls and exciting envy at fellow
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Museums have discovered advertising,'' said David Ross,
director of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and former
director of the Whitney Museum of American Art. ``You can advertise
garbage and make millions. Imagine if you advertise something with
real value.''
</P>
<P>
   With Americans flocking to art museums in record numbers, such
hits _ shows that seize you by the lapels and bellow, ``What! You
haven't lined up for `The Treasury of Saint Francis of Assisi'
yet?'' _ lend a gloss and urgency to art, science and history,
while posing questions about commercialism and exploitation.
</P>
<P>
   Eyebrows in the museum world arched last December when Ben
Hartley, director of communications and sponsorship for the Solomon
R. Guggenheim Museum in New York, said, ``We are in the
entertainment business and competing against other forms of
entertainment out there.'' The Guggenheim reached blockbuster
nirvana with its show on motorcycles, which drew half a million
visitors.
</P>
<P>
   But blockbusters have their defenders. ``These great moments of
acute interest create exceptional teaching opportunities,'' said
Ellen Futter, director of the Museum of Natural History, whose show
``Epidemic!'' on infectious diseases, has drawn more than 150,000
visitors since Feb. 27. ``They create a gateway to learning.''
</P>
<P>
   Museum calendars are replete with big exhibitions of plainly
blockbuster ambitions _ shows on Ingres' portraiture, the age of
the Pyramids, new archaeological finds from China and the
ever-popular impressionists, truly the museum world's most reliable
moneymakers.
</P>
<P>
   The Met weighed in last month with ``Cezanne to van Gogh,''
featuring the renowned collection of van Gogh's physician, Dr.
Paul-Ferdinand Gachet. ``I don't sit around thinking what will
bring in crowds,'' said Philippe de Montebello, who after two
decades as director was recently elevated to chief executive
officer as well.
</P>
<P>
   The Brooklyn Museum of Art days later opened its
``Impressionists in Winter,'' lauded by the museum's director,
Arnold Lehman, as ``literally the coolest show.''
</P>

BUILDING A COSMIC TAPE MEASURE

<P>
   Throughout the century, scientists have had to rely on
maddeningly oblique methods, laden with assumptions, for measuring
the size of the universe. They've had to guess, from purely
theoretical considerations, how bright a star or galaxy really is.
Then from its apparent brightness, dimmed by the journey of the
light through space, they judge its distance.
</P>
<P>
   These interpretations have been so open to debate that the
universe seems to expand and contract like an accordion. With
uncertainty long considered the norm, it was remarkable when
astronomers boldly announced on Tuesday that they had gauged the
distance of a galaxy a full 23.5 million light-years away using a
stunningly direct approach that relied on little more than simple
trigonometry.
</P>
<P>
   ``This measurement is the golden meter stick in the glass
case,'' Morris Aizenman, executive officer of the National Science
Foundation's Division of Astronomical Sciences proclaimed in a news
release. The results came from Dr. James Herrnstein of the National
Radio Astronomy Observatory in Socorro, N.M., and a team of
scientists from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics and
other institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists are already confident that they can measure how fast
galaxies are receding from the primordial big-bang explosion. If
they can more precisely know the distances, they can finally close
in on the long-disputed number called the Hubble constant, the key
to how rapidly the universe is expanding and to calculating its age
and size.
</P>
<P>
   It was a week for dramatic _ and conflicting _ announcements.
The previous Tuesday, astronomers from the Carnegie Observatories
in Pasadena, Calif., made headlines by announcing that using the
orbiting Hubble Space Telescope, they had narrowed the age of the
universe to 12 billion to perhaps 14 billion years.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates from competing astronomers, which used to be off a
full 100 percent, were said to have been pared down to a mere 10
percent. In a widely quoted line, one astronomer said that it was
as if scientists, accustomed to arguing over whether the universe
had one foot or two, were now quibbling about a single toe.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the measurement by the Herrnstein team, using the Very
Long Baseline Array, a network of dish antennas that capture
stellar radio waves instead of visible light. If their results hold
up, the Carnegie estimate could be 15 percent (a toe and a half)
too high.
</P>
<P>
   There is still plenty of wiggle room in the calculations.
Determining the universe's age also depends on how much gravity
slows the expansion and how much something called the cosmological
constant speeds it up. But with this splash of cold water, the
earlier euphoria suddenly seemed premature.
</P>
<P>
   Since the late 1920s, when the astronomer Edwin Hubble began
observing the expansion from the big bang, there has been nothing
very constant about his constant.
</P>
<P>
   According to Hubble's law, the farther a celestial object is
from Earth, the faster it will appear to be receding. Pick an
object in the sky and measure its velocity and distance. Dividing
one by the other gives the Hubble constant _ and with that you have
a grip on the rate at which the galaxies are flying apart. From
there you can work backward, estimating how long ago everything was
compacted into the primordial bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers feel certain that they can directly determine one of
these numbers, the velocity of an object's recession, by its red
shift: The faster something is moving away, the more its light
waves should be stretched toward the red end of the spectrum _ a
phenomenon based on the well-known Doppler effect. It is the other
number, the distance of an object, that causes most of the
consternation.
</P>
<P>
   Since ancient times, astronomers have measured the distance of
nearby planets and stars by using trigonometry. Gauge how much
their positions in the sky seem to shift as one moves from one part
of the Earth to another, or as the Earth moves around the sun. From
this ``parallax'' one can calculate how far away something is.
</P>
<P>
   But estimating distances beyond the range of parallax _ recently
set at a mere few hundred light-years _ has required more
imagination. The Carnegie observations rely on stars called Cepheid
variables, which blink at a rate believed to vary with their
brightness. If two of these beacons are pulsating at the same pace
and one appears dimmer, then it is assumed to be farther away.
</P>
<P>
   But the system is fraught with uncertainty. To confidently
measure absolute as opposed to relative distance, you have to
calibrate the yardstick by directly measuring how far away the
nearest Cepheids are. Astronomers have tried to do this using
parallactic observations by the European Space Agency satellite
Hipparcos. But the measurements are tricky and the data unsure.
</P>
<P>
   And there are other problems. A Cepheid's rhythm may be thrown
off by its metallic content. More guesswork comes in when
astronomers try to judge how much of the dimming of a Cepheid's
light comes not from distance but intervening cosmic dust.
</P>
<P>
   The results from the Very Long Baseline Array cut through these
assumptions, measuring the distance of a galaxy (NGC 4258 in the
constellation Ursa Major) with old-fashioned parallax. By using
computers to coordinate the data from 10 radio telescopes, ranging
from Hawaii across North America to the Virgin Islands, the
astronomers essentially simulated a dish antenna thousands of miles
wide. This let them measure the galaxy's radio wave emissions with
a resolution so fine that it puts even the Hubble telescope to
shame.
</P>
<P>
   The astronomers focused on a rotating disc of gas at the
galaxy's core. First they calculated how fast it was spinning by
measuring how much the Doppler effect stretched and squeezed its
radio waves. Then they compared this intrinsic velocity with how
fast the disc appears to spin from Earth. The farther something is,
the more slowly it seems to move _ parallax again. Think of how a
jet plane seems to inch across the sky. Trigonometry then yields
the distance.
</P>
<P>
   Though this new method greatly expands the power of parallax, it
still has its limits. The galaxy was measured at 23.5 million
light-years away; the universe is billions of light-years wide.
Reaching farther will still require Cepheids and other indirect
methods. But now there may be a better way to ensure the accuracy
of these yardsticks, putting a more solid foundation under
astronomers' feet.

   ABUJA, Nigeria _ As Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo waited to be
inaugurated as Nigeria's new president a week ago, a man he used to
visit in prison sat a few seats to his right: President Nelson
Mandela of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders of Africa's two most powerful nations, possibly the
two most respected politicians on the continent, embraced warmly.
Maybe it occurred to them that the pupil seemed to have overtaken
the teacher. It is a thought that has occurred to many in recent
days as Nigeria installed its first elected president in a
generation and South Africa successfully held its second democratic
election.
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria, after all, once stood as the uncontested leader in
Africa. It was the staunchest backer of liberation movements in
South Africa and other white-ruled countries, and Obasanjo stood as
one of the most vocal critics of apartheid. And yet South Africa
preceded Nigeria into democratic government, holding its first
all-race elections in 1994 even as Nigeria slipped into a ruthless
military dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   Now here was Mandela traveling to Nigeria just four days before
South Africa's elections on Wednesday, evidently confident of the
stability he leaves behind in his retirement. Contrast that to the
situation of Obasanjo, who recently came out of retirement to lead
his disoriented nation into the shakiest of democracies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was disappointed that although Nigeria assisted South Africa
to get rid of apartheid, South Africa breathed the air of democracy
before we did,'' said Larry Agboh, an official in Obasanjo's
People's Democratic Party. ``We were expecting Nigeria, as the most
populous nation in Africa, to lead Africa toward full democracy.
That would have guaranteed Nigeria's position as the true leader on
the continent.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1994 election in South Africa was a bittersweet moment,
Agboh added, ``sweet in the sense that I was happy that apartheid
was over, and bitter in the sense that here was the junior brother
leading Nigeria, the senior brother, into democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Agboh was inspecting the new National Assembly building here as
Nigeria's newly elected senators and representatives met for the
first time on Thursday. With fixtures still unattached and the
smell of fresh paint in the air, the building suggested a democracy
in the making. The point did not escape visitors who wandered into
a third-floor gallery, pressing their noses against windows that
looked down on the assembly hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it were still a military administration, I will not be
allowed beyond the gate,'' said Mohammed Gawuna, 35. ``From this
window, I can peep and see my representatives at work.'' Another
onlooker, Morgan West, 31, added, ``This building is a symbol of
the beginning of democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   By any standard, creating an enduring democracy here will be an
enormous task. The constitution is a month old, handed down by
decree by the outgoing military government. There is no
institutional check on corruption, though Obasanjo took a first
step last week by setting up a panel to investigate contracts
awarded since the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing close to a middle class, as the gulf has
widened between an extremely rich minority and an impoverished
majority. A generation of corrupt military rule has eroded popular
trust, as the government of the world's seventh-largest
oil-producer has failed to deliver basics like electricity and
potable water to its 110 million people.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, since Mandela's African National Congress was
elected in 1994, South Africa has adopted one of the most liberal
constitutions in the world, and its legal system has been entirely
reformed. Millions more have clean water now, and even residents of
squatter camps have access to electricity and telephones. And if
last week's election of Thabo Mbeki, the ANC's only candidate to
replace Mandela, is any indication, Mandela's legacy includes a
self-sustaining democracy.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the 1970s, it looked as though Nigeria would be the giant
leading postcolonial Africa into democracy. Its coffers flush with
oil money, Nigeria became the leading African opponent of
white-ruled governments in South Africa, Namibia and the former
Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   As Nigeria opened its checkbook, leaders of several African
liberation movements operated out of Lagos. Nigeria even had a
civilian government in 1979 until a coup ended it in 1983.
Obasanjo, the military ruler in the late 1970s, pursued efforts to
end apartheid after his retirement. As a member of a Commonwealth
mediation effort, he visited Mandela three times in Pollsmoor
prison outside Cape Town, South Africa, in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Often the only African nation with embassies in Western
capitals, Nigeria came to regard itself as the world's black
superpower. ``Some of us dream of Nigeria being to blacks in the
diaspora what Jerusalem is to Jews in the diaspora,'' Nigeria's
foreign minister, Bolaji Akinyemi, said in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   But the country's northern military rulers tightened their grip
in the 1990s. They annulled the results of the presidential
elections on June 12, 1993, which would have given victory to a
southern Yoruba businessman, Moshood K.O. Abiola.
</P>
<P>
   ``June 12 has done us a lot of damage,'' said Anthony Adefuye, a
senator from 1991 to 1993, when the military government briefly
permitted civilians at the state and local levels. ``If June 12 had
been real, we would have democratized before South Africa. In
politics, one slip will take you a hundred steps to recover.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon after South Africa's post-apartheid era began, Nigeria fell
under the repressive regime of Gen. Sani Abacha. As investors left
Nigeria, they gravitated to South Africa. In 1995, after the writer
Ken Saro-Wiwa was hanged for protesting the use of oil resources,
Nigeria became an international pariah.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela, leading the nation that many regarded as Africa's new
leader, repeatedly called for an oil boycott of Nigeria. Abacha
retaliated by withdrawing Nigeria's soccer team from the African
Nations Cup, which was held in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   But Abacha died suddenly a year ago, and Obasanjo has returned
as Nigeria's leader. ``It is our firm resolve to restore Nigeria
fully to her previous prestigious position in the comity of
nations,'' he said during his inauguration.
</P>
<P>
   So Nigeria finds itself under enormous pressure to fulfill the
moment's promise. It is Nigeria's last chance, many here say. But
in the same breath, Nigerians, famous for their fighting spirit,
declare they will soon catch up to and surpass their southern
neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we talk of African-ness,'' Agboh said, ``Nigeria is 100
percent African, much more than South Africa, which is mixed. The
greatness of Nigeria will be a pride to the whole black race.''

IN INDONESIA, THE VOTING IS ONLY A FIRST STEP

   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ With drums, whistles and war whoops, with
dancers, tumblers and female impersonators, Indonesians have
grasped the first great truth about free elections: They can be
lots of fun.
</P>
<P>
   But there is another truth as well. One election does not make a
country a democracy. Institutions, traditions and social cohesion
do. So the big question on the eve of Indonesia's first free
election in 44 years is whether it will set the world's
fourth-most-populous nation on the path toward democratic stability
or toward new turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   One foreign election expert wishes, in fact, that the
parliamentary election scheduled for tomorrow could be a trial run.
People are learning about democracy here by trial and error, the
expert said, and the stakes are far too high.
</P>
<P>
   ``One year ago, Indonesians were political naifs,'' said the
expert, a foreign diplomat. ``Now that picture is changing.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Suharto was forced to resign the presidency in May 1998,
Indonesia has been learning fast, moving from street demonstrations
to party organizing, from utopian philosophizing to the beginnings
of coalition building. Still, nobody knows what patterns the voting
will take or how this nation of more than 200 million jostling and
often feuding people will manage the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the people will vote freely, or perhaps they will
continue to answer to the village headman, as they have for
generations. Maybe the losers will accept the outcome or maybe the
results will trigger a new wave of demonstrations, followed by
riots and the use of military force.
</P>
<P>
   How effectively will a new government begin the building of
democratic institutions? Will it respond to the public demand for
an end to what is known as KKN _ the Indonesian initials for
corruption, collusion and nepotism?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see a transition to democracy as inevitable, despite
the holding of elections,'' said David Timberman, an American
electoral expert. ``There is nothing inexorable about this process.
Its outcomes depend a lot on the leadership and behavior of the new
political parties in Parliament.''
</P>
<P>
   The hard work still lies ahead, said Jusuf Wanandi, the head of
the Center for Strategic and International Studies, an independent
policy institute. ``I am much more optimistic about the election
than about what comes after,'' he said. ``I am dreading the
difficulties we will have in creating a real coalition government _
animosities, jealousies, prima donnas.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, worst-case scenarios have so far not been realized,
beginning with the largely peaceful and raucously enthusiastic
three-week election campaign that is now ending.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts warn that the campaign revelers may be setting
themselves up for harsh disappointments when the results come in.
But Indonesia has shown a great deal more political maturity in the
past year than many people _ notably Suharto _ gave them credit
for.
</P>
<P>
   Just to get as far as this has been an extraordinary
achievement. Indonesia had no revolution. It did not overturn its
government, only the man at the top. It did not change its
constitution or its basic laws, reform its institutions or bring
any but a few low-ranking soldiers to trial.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic reform in Indonesia, so far, floats on air. Yet it is
undeniably a force in play, a clear expression of popular will. The
force appears to have begun building even when Suharto was in
power, and to have burst forth since he departed.
</P>
<P>
   A newly free press has emerged, even as the politically
intrusive military has been humbled and the government has shown a
new responsiveness to public opinion. The elections themselves,
created by Suharto's holdover Parliament, are the results of this
reformist pressure, which the Suharto men who still run Indonesia
have been unable to ignore, political analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   The country has avoided calamity over the past year, remaining
far more stable than many had expected. A surge of pre-election
violence was widely predicted, but it did not materialize except
for clashes in some already unstable areas. There has been no wave
of religious warfare. Student demonstrators have withdrawn from the
streets to participate in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Though the economy has not recovered yet from a battering during
East Asia's financial crisis a year ago, the harvest has been good
and there have been no food riots; the currency has stabilized at
double its lowest rate 18 months ago and there is a glimmer of hope
for better times.
</P>
<P>
   But Indonesia still lacks the solid middle class that would form
the foundation of a thoroughgoing democracy, said Juwono Sudarsono,
the minister of education and a leading political analyst. Politics
remains a battleground between haves and have-nots and between
factions and ethnic groups, rather than a true discourse, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a long way to go,'' Juwono said, noting that
Indonesia's middle class is far more shallow than those of the
emerging democracies of Thailand, South Korea or the Philippines.
``It could be 25 years before we can achieve their level of 30
percent of the population being middle class.''
</P>
<P>
   The first free election in a newly independent Indonesia was
also its last, in 1955. Shortly afterward, the country's founding
president, Sukarno, decreed that parliamentary democracy was not
working and instituted in its place an authoritarian model he
called ``guided democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   He was responding to the political realities of the day but also
to the popular mood, which demanded firm leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sense is that there is a cyclical aspect to this whole
thing, that authoritarianism and democracy are popular at different
times and that we are now in a very anti-authoritarian point in the
cycle,'' said Herbert Feith, an Australian political scientist who
was here during the 1955 election.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he said, new democratic institutions are not yet in place.
But he said the mood of the nation _ the public discourse _ can be
a powerful force in its own right.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Suharto crowd lost control of the public discourse, and
the discourse has a life of its own,'' Feith said. Whatever
happens, he suggested, the tide of democratic reform in Indonesia
is not likely to be easily reversed.

   ``My sense is that there is a cyclical aspect to this whole
thing, that authoritarianism and democracy are popular at different
times and that we are now in a very anti-authoritarian point in the
cycle,'' said Herbert Feith, an Australian political scientist who
was here during the 1955 election.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he said, new democratic institutions are not yet in place.
But he said the mood of the nation _ the public discourse _ can be
a powerful force in its own right.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Suharto crowd lost control of the public discourse, and
the discourse has a life of its own,'' Feith said. Whatever
happens, he suggested, the tide of democratic reform in Indonesia
is not likely to be easily reversed.

   CAIRO, Egypt _ Tehran, Iran, is abuzz again, divided now over
whether the United States really is still the Great Satan. And as
usual, the ferocity of Iran's internal power struggles makes it
hard to know what is going on.
</P>
<P>
   This time, though, the confusion seems to run two ways. This
Iranian row seems to have been prompted by American mixed signals _
tantalizing but ambiguous all the same _ about whether the United
States is ready to go easier on Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Unless you are in the Middle East, you may have missed all this;
just about everywhere else, the crisis in Kosovo has exhausted
people's attention. So here's a quick primer on the latest in
U.S.-Iranian relations _ the winks, nods and backhanded slaps that
may amount to a lot or to absolutely nothing at all.
</P>
<P>
   First, on April 12, President Clinton told a White House
audience that Iran had been subjected to ``quite a lot of abuse''
over the years; it was important to tell people, he said, ``Look,
you have a right to be angry.'' In Iran, ears perked up,
particularly among political moderates. Was this a first step
toward a long-sought U.S. apology?
</P>
<P>
   Ten days later, a State Department official showed a colder
hand. Certainly, said Martin Indyk, an assistant secretary of
state, the United States wants dialogue with Iran, but first on the
agenda would be those old subjects that make Iranians cringe:
terrorism and weapons of mass destruction. Aha, Iranian
conservatives said. A good-guy-bad-guy routine, nothing more than
American mischief!
</P>
<P>
   At the end of April came a flurry of paper from the U.S.
government. One rule eased the way for Iranian scholars to travel
to the United States, another softened sanctions half a notch by
allowing food and medicine to be sold to Iran. Then came a State
Department report that again identified Iran as a sponsor of
terrorism _ but not, as in the past, as the world's leader in that
field.
</P>
<P>
   It all amounted to nothing more than a ``diplomatic smile,''
complained Iran's foreign minister, Kamal Kharazzi. A better
summation might have been that it simply left just about everyone
more confused.
</P>
<P>
   ``These Americans are crooks,'' Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati, the
head of Iran's judiciary, warned in one Friday sermon as he sounded
the conservative line. ``Why are some people so naive as to believe
in them?''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the moderate Iran Daily said it saw the beginning
of ``a new chapter'' and declared: ``It is high time to ensure
practical steps for normal ties.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems clear that Iran's president, Mohammed Khatami, is open
to warmer ties with the United States. But he remains hemmed in by
Iran's conservatives, led by the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei. As recently as mid-May, a delegation of senior clerics
appointed by Khamenei presented Khatami with a petition saying that
the time was not right for Iranian-U.S. relations to be restored.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since those ties were broken off after the Iranian
revolution of 1979, conservatives have tried to squelch talk of a
detente. They have reminded just about anyone who would listen that
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic Republic,
once likened Iranian-U.S. relations to those between sheep and
wolf.
</P>
<P>
   But for a year and a half now, Khatami's moderate government and
the Clinton administration have been cautiously swapping hints of a
willingness to explore moving toward warmer ties. And some
Iranians, eager for improved trade, have begun to read into the
U.S. overtures a reason for rapprochement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States may still be a wolf, but Iran has turned
into a lion,'' Mehdi Karrubi, a longtime anti-Western firebrand who
has become a Khatami ally, declared last month, neatly suggesting
that Khomeini's warnings belonged to a distant era.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, Iran's government has ruled out direct talks until
Washington redresses past wrongs, presumably by lifting economic
sanctions and unfreezing millions of dollars of Iranian assets held
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Washington, for its part, has said that it is ready to talk _
but that there can be no revival of economic ties until Iran takes
the concrete steps that Indyk outlined in his April 22 speech:
halting support for terrorism, abandoning opposition to Middle East
peace and giving up efforts to acquire weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   In practical terms, that leaves the two countries at
loggerheads, despite the feelers each has sent since January 1998,
when Khatami, in a CNN interview, called for a ``dialogue of
civilizations'' and in effect apologized for the November 1979
takeover of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
   Still, every subtle signal is carefully digested, and Clinton's
remarks in April were hailed by moderate Iranian newspapers and
some politicians as at least a first step toward an American
apology.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The president's statement, which surprised even his foreign
policy advisers, included this sentence: ``I think sometimes it's
quite important to tell people, `Look, you have a right to be angry
at something my country, or my culture, or others that are
generally allied with us today, did to you 50 or 60 or 100 or 150
years ago.'''
</P>
<P>
   In Iran, provincial governors welcomed the words as Clinton's
``acceptance that the demands of the Iranian people are just.''
</P>
<P>
   Khatami's government, on the other hand, has had to be more
circumspect; its continuing war with the powerful conservative bloc
has left Khatami wary of being portrayed as bowing to the United
States. In its official statements, Iran has gone so far as to say
only that the United States might be showing ``greater realism.''
</P>
<P>
   And certainly the hesitation also runs both ways. No matter how
the Iranians or analysts of the Iranian-U.S. relationship have
tried to interpret this murky dialogue, administration spokesmen
keep insisting that U.S. policy has not changed.

   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ Before the Kurdish guerrilla leader Abdullah
Ocalan went on trial last Monday, Turkish officials decided to
ensure that the official press would choose its words carefully.
</P>
<P>
   Ocalan, who is known as Apo, is charged with treason in
connection with his role in organizing and waging the long-running
war between Kurds who inhabit the southeastern part of Turkey and
the Turkish government. Moreover, the Kurdish issue is among the
most sensitive in the country.
</P>
<P>
   So the Interior Ministry issued a directive listing terms that
must not be used when discussing Ocalan, his movement or Kurds in
general. It is binding on reporters and commentators for the
Anatolia news agency, the state-run TRT radio and television
network, and public affairs officers at all government agencies,
though not on reporters for privately owned press outlets or on
foreign correspondents.
</P>
<P>
   In the government's view, violence in Kurdish provinces is
simply terror sponsored from abroad, mainly by Iraq, Syria and
Greece.
</P>
<P>
   Officials reject the idea that it is a war, that the insurgent
Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, has any popular base, or that
there is any political aspect to the fighting. They often insist
there is no ``Kurdish problem'' in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the Kurdistan Workers Party, however, say that
what has been under way in southeastern Turkey since 1984 is a war
to free Kurds from oppression. The Kurds have been blocked from all
forms of legal protest, they assert, and have taken up arms as a
last resort.
</P>
<P>
   Some foreigners agree, in whole or in part. Turkey's treatment
of its more than 10 million Kurds has been widely criticized
abroad, and has come under new scrutiny during the trial.
</P>
<P>
   The Interior Ministry directive said that the government needs
to adopt a ``unity of terminology'' in presenting its case to the
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taking recent developments into consideration,'' it said, ``we
do not want to leave room for future discussions or ill-intentioned
debates stemming from terms that have been used.''
</P>
<P>
   These are the unacceptable terms, followed by what the
government says are correct ones that should be used in their
place:
</P>
<P>
   Guerrilla _  &UR; Terrorist. &LR;
</P>
<P>

   Colleges celebrate the end of the academic season with
traditions peculiar to their institutions. Perhaps the defining
word is ``peculiar.'' Wellesley seniors dress in their graduation
gowns and roll wooden hoops around the campus. At Columbia, the
marching band parades through the library on the night before the
organic chemistry final, probably to help concentrate the mind.

<P>
   On the last night of classes at Williams College in
Williamstown, Mass., the student radio station WCFM conducts a
marathon trivia contest. Teams of almost any number can enter. The
twice-yearly event was first held some 30 years ago. The number of
questions ranges from 500 to around 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of questions are given over the air. Hundreds more are
given out on paper, and they must be turned in, much like the tests
students were supposedly studying for. Last month, a team called
Pokemon Laboratory, which refers to a crucial locale in the popular
Nintendo game Pokemon, won top honors after tackling such arcana as
the names for all the members of the Jefferson Airplane. The prize?
The winners get to put together next semester's test.

<P>
   The on-air questions are divided into categories, which are each
broken down into ``realm'' and ``subrealm.'' Hints are offered, and
participants phone in answers while the station plays a helpful
song.
</P>
<P>
   Realm: Dietary Restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Subrealm: But It's Gotta Taste Worse Than Cream-of-Pork Soup.
</P>
<P>
   Q: According to a Michigan restaurant owner, Lent is going to
cause sales of a particular dish to skyrocket, presumably because
of dietary restrictions. What is this Lenten food?
</P>
<P>
   A: Sauteed Muskrat.
</P>
<P>
   Song: ``Muskrat Love'' by America.
</P>
<P>
   Realm: Tips, Gratuities and Other Bribes.
</P>
<P>
   Subrealm: Don't They Have Anything Better to Do at Cornell?
</P>
<P>
   Q: According to a recent Cornell University study, waiters can
do one very quick and simple thing to increase their tips. What
should they do?
</P>
<P>
   A: Draw a smiley face on the check.
</P>
<P>
   Song: ``Happy'' by the Red Elvises.
</P>
<P>
   Realm: Fictional Characters.
</P>
<P>
   Subrealm: And Their Fictional Bed Partners.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What Well-Known Fictional Character Brags That His
``Experience of Women Spans Three Continents''?
</P>
<P>
   A: Dr. Watson.
</P>
<P>
   Song: ``Simultaneous Lovin''' by Chef.
</P>
<P>
   Realm: Musicians.
</P>
<P>
   Subrealm: Who Kick Butt
</P>
<P>
   Q: What singing sensation recorded the title track for the Hong
Kong release of ``Beauty and the Beast''?
</P>
<P>
   A: Jackie Chan.
</P>
<P>
   Song: ``Supercop'' by Devo.
</P>
<P>
   Realm: The Great Outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   Subrealm: The Wide World of Sports.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In 1976, Wes Chandler of the University of Florida had a
rather rude greeting in the end zone when he scored a touchdown
against Auburn. What was it?
</P>
<P>
   A: Auburn's War Eagle ((its mascot)) flew off its perch and
started pecking at him.
</P>
<P>
   Song: ``My Man'' by the Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   Realm: Short People Unite.
</P>
<P>
   Subrealm: Robble Robble! Your Soul Is Mine!
</P>
<P>
   Q. The 4-foot-tall stand-up comedian best known for his role as
McDonaldLand's Hamburglar has fallen on hard times of late. He has
found himself working at a Mexican restaurant in Milwaukee, Wis.,
where he was recently the subject of a lawsuit brought by the
American Association of Short People. Why?
</P>
<P>
   A. He walked around the restaurant, serving chips and salsa from
the brim of his sombrero.
</P>
<P>
   Song: ``Hey Mickey'' (Spanish version) by Toni Basil.
</P>
<P>
   The all-night marathon had eight bonus hours, which the Williams
wags called ``Hour Boni.'' One category was ``Espionage'':
</P>
<P>
   Q. What uncredited actor bit the dust in an elevator incident in
``Mission: Impossible''?
</P>
<P>
   A. Emilio Estevez.
</P>
<P>
   Q. In ``Goldfinger,'' why was the car-crushing sequence not
terribly convincing?
</P>
<P>
   A. When the car was lifted by the crane, you could see there was
no engine inside.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What is the earliest recorded spy mission in history?
</P>
<P>
   A. Moses sent spies into the Promised Land (Numbers 13).
</P>
<P>
   Another bonus hour, ``Antiquated Technology,'' concentrated on
computers, warfare and miscellany:
</P>
<P>
   Q. What was the original computer bug, and who discovered it?
</P>
<P>
   A. A moth, by Admiral Grace Hopper ((U.S. Navy)).
</P>
<P>
   Q. Who owns the basic patent on the microcomputer?
</P>
<P>
   A. Michael May.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why was the M-16 rifle much more deadly before it was
``improved''?
</P>
<P>
   A. The rifling on the barrel was corrected, thus bullets flew
straight. Before the rifling was fixed, they tumbled in the air,
causing much more grievous damage.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Darkened glasses were invented in China prior to 1430. What
was their use before Europeans decided to use them to shield their
eyes from the sun's glare?
</P>
<P>
   A. To prevent people from seeing a judge's expression in court.
A judge's opinions were kept absolutely secret until the trial's
conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   The most subjective category was ``Action Boni,'' in which
players earned points by visiting the WCFM studios every hour on
the half-hour to physically act out an improbable scenario. The
most creative interpretations of these cryptic titles received the
highest scores.
</P>
<P>
   12:30 a.m.: ``Nietzsche in Love.'' 1:30: ``Job Interview for the
Presidency of Williams College.'' 2:30: ``The Phantom Menace of the
Opera.'' 4:30: ``Platonic Ideal of Kubrick Movies.'' 5:30: ``J.A.
Confidential'' ((junior adviser)). 6:30: ``Beyond the Valley of the
Muppets.''
</P>
<P>
   There were two super bonus sections, which were distributed at
midnight and 4 a.m. One dealt largely with rock star necrology:
</P>
<P>
   The Night They Ran Old Dixie Down: Name the three members of the
Lynyrd Skynyrd Band who died in the infamous plane crash. (Ronnie
Van Zant, Steven Gaines, Cassie Gaines)
</P>
<P>
   During their first concert after the plane crash, how did Lynyrd
Skynyrd salute the absence of their late lead singer? (They left a
single mike unused where he used to stand.)
</P>
<P>
   Name the ((Lynyrd Skynyrd)) member who was paralyzed in a car
accident, lost his wife in 1980, suffered from depression, lost his
girlfriend in 1986, was an alcoholic and died of pneumonia in 1990.
(Allen Collins)
</P>
<P>
   The other super bonus section was ``Famous Last Words'':
</P>

   Quotations (Final words before dying)
</P>
<P>
   ``Go on, get out! Last words are for fools who haven't said
enough!'' (Karl Marx)

   On Anniversary of Massacre, Silence and Introspection
</P>
<P>
   Beijing marked the 10th anniversary of the massacre at Tiananmen
Square with a nervous silence. Over the last decade, there has been
little public discussion of the incident, which began on the night
of June 3, 1989, and lasted until the morning of June 4.
</P>
<P>
   An unknown number of pro-democracy demonstrators were killed
when tanks rolled in to quell six weeks of protest.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities have never given a public accounting of the
death toll; the estimates of witnesses and human rights
organizations range from several hundred to more than 2,000.
</P>
<P>
   Exiled leaders of the democracy movement, including some who
spent years in prison, gathered at Harvard University to mark the
occasion. They acknowledged mistakes they had made, but insisted
that the movement they began has changed China for the better.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, President Clinton briefly acknowledged the
anniversary and argued that only by pushing ahead on expanding
trade with Beijing can the United States remain ``a force for
change in China.''
</P>
<P>
   Nine Die in Arkansas Crash as Plane Lands During Storm
</P>
<P>
   An American Airlines jet crashed on landing in Little Rock,
Ark., killing eight passengers and the pilot. Investigators first
began concentrating on the severe weather, which may have blown the
plane off the runway, but it soon became clear that the reason for
the incident may be far more complex. Federal officials said some
of the plane's braking devices did not appear to have been properly
set up. Although the pilot was experienced, he had been on duty
near the maximum of 14 hours.

   Japanese Officials Move to Lift Ban on the Pill
</P>
<P>
   In a major step toward approving the birth control pill, Japan's
top medical advisory council suddenly reversed its position and
recommended allowing the pill to be sold. Japan is the only
industrialized country to ban the pill, and the issue has been
debated for decades. Some feminists argue that the ban reflects
male domination of Japanese society and politics.
</P>
<P>
   The case for the pill got a lift recently from the speedy
approval of Viagra, which treats impotence in men. That provoked an
uproar from women's groups who demanded that the pill also be
approved. The pill could be available this fall.
</P>

<P>
   European Nations Vote to Become Military Power
</P>
<P>
   The European Union's 15 member nations decided to become a
single military power and to appoint a single foreign and security
policy official.
</P>
<P>
   By late 2000, according to a plan announced at the European
Summit in Cologne, Germany, the European leaders would establish a
command headquarters and a joint force for peacekeeping missions in
future crises like those in Kosovo and Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Making the European Union a military power would enable NATO
members, as well as several nations that are not members of NATO,
to mount their own campaigns without having to rely on American
might.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch to Offer Trading on the Internet
</P>
<P>
   The thundering herd just made a sharp U-turn. For more than two
decades, Merrill Lynch, the United States' biggest stock brokers,
scoffed at ``do it yourself'' discount investing.
</P>
<P>
   But recently even some of Merrill's well-heeled clients have
been lured by the excitement _ and far lower commissions _ of
trading for themselves on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   More than 6 million households now trade stocks over the
Internet, accounting for one in every seven stock trades in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   So the brokerage bent to the pressures of the Internet era and
said it would introduce a flat rate of $29.95 per trade on the
World Wide Web. Just don't ask for any advice.

<P>
   Barnes &AMP; Noble Withdraws Offer to Buy Ingram
</P>
<P>
   Barnes &AMP; Noble, the United States' biggest bookseller, decided
to withdraw its $600 million offer to buy Ingram Book Group, the
largest book wholesaler, after federal officials prepared to
challenge the deal on antitrust grounds.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was a victory for smaller bookstores, which have
grown dependent on Ingram. They had argued that they would be put
in a perilous position if their main competitor also owned their
primary supplier.

<P>
   Teamsters Strike Averted
</P>
<P>
   James P. Hoffa, the Teamsters' new president, had his first
chance to demonstrate that he could be a heavyweight at the
bargaining table like his famous father, James R. Hoffa. The
younger Hoffa received respectable marks for negotiating a contract
for 12,800 workers who haul new cars to dealers. In an era when
companies are cutting retirement benefits, he won higher pensions,
health coverage for workers who retire at age 55 and prescription
benefits for retirees over 65.
</P>
<P>
   _ STEVEN GREENHOUSE
</P>
<P>
   Worries Over Muscle Drug
</P>
<P>
   Scientists were surprised _ and concerned. Iowa State University
researchers conducted tests on androstenedione, the drug Mark
McGwire said he used on his way to becoming baseball's home run
king. And around which a multimillion-dollar business sprang up on
claims that it builds muscle.
</P>
<P>
   In natural form, it converts to testosterone, which does build
muscle. The scientists put 30 young men on 100 milligrams, some on
placebos; some on weight training, some not. The finding: No
increase in testosterone or muscle, but increases in estrogen,
which can cause pancreatic cancer and heart disease in men. The
implication: a possible ban if larger studies corroborate the
findings.
</P>

<P>
   Reporters Ordered to Jail in Olympic Bomb Case
</P>
<P>
   An Atlanta judge ordered two reporters for The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution to be jailed for refusing to reveal the
sources who told them that Richard Jewell, a part-time security
guard, was a leading suspect in the bombing at the 1996 Summer
Olympic Games in Atlanta. Another man has been charged in the
bombing, and Jewell is suing the newspaper for libel. Peter
Canfield, the attorney for the newspaper, has filed an appeal.

   Hillary Clinton Edges Closer
</P>
<P>
   The curtain lifted a few more inches on Hillary Rodham Clinton's
plans _ though not, it would seem, by the first lady's choice. Rep.
Nita Lowey, the Westchester County Democrat who had said she would
run for the Senate from New York if Mrs. Clinton did not, called
Mrs. Clinton to inform her that she was giving up and would instead
run for the House.
</P>

   On Anniversary of Massacre, Silence and Introspection
</P>
<P>
   Beijing marked the 10th anniversary of the massacre at Tiananmen
Square with a nervous silence. Over the last decade, there has been
little public discussion of the incident, which began on the night
of June 3, 1989, and lasted until the morning of June 4.
</P>
<P>
   An unknown number of pro-democracy demonstrators were killed
when tanks rolled in to quell six weeks of protest.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities have never given a public accounting of the
death toll; the estimates of witnesses and human rights
organizations range from several hundred to more than 2,000.
</P>
<P>
   Exiled leaders of the democracy movement, including some who
spent years in prison, gathered at Harvard University to mark the
occasion. They acknowledged mistakes they had made, but insisted
that the movement they began has changed China for the better.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, President Clinton briefly acknowledged the
anniversary and argued that only by pushing ahead on expanding
trade with Beijing can the United States remain ``a force for
change in China.''

   Nine Die in Arkansas Crash as Plane Lands During Storm
</P>
<P>
   An American Airlines jet crashed on landing in Little Rock,
Ark., killing eight passengers and the pilot. Investigators first
began concentrating on the severe weather, which may have blown the
plane off the runway, but it soon became clear that the reason for
the incident may be far more complex. Federal officials said some
of the plane's braking devices did not appear to have been properly
set up. Although the pilot was experienced, he had been on duty
near the maximum of 14 hours.

   Japanese Officials Move to Lift Ban on the Pill
</P>
<P>
   In a major step toward approving the birth control pill, Japan's
top medical advisory council suddenly reversed its position and
recommended allowing the pill to be sold. Japan is the only
industrialized country to ban the pill, and the issue has been
debated for decades. Some feminists argue that the ban reflects
male domination of Japanese society and politics.
</P>
<P>
   The case for the pill got a lift recently from the speedy
approval of Viagra, which treats impotence in men. That provoked an
uproar from women's groups who demanded that the pill also be
approved. The pill could be available this fall.

   European Nations Vote to Become Military Power
</P>
<P>
   The European Union's 15 member nations decided to become a
single military power and to appoint a single foreign and security
policy official.
</P>
<P>
   By late 2000, according to a plan announced at the European
Summit in Cologne, Germany, the European leaders would establish a
command headquarters and a joint force for peacekeeping missions in
future crises like those in Kosovo and Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Making the European Union a military power would enable NATO
members, as well as several nations that are not members of NATO,
to mount their own campaigns without having to rely on American
might.

   Merrill Lynch to Offer Trading on the Internet
</P>
<P>
   The thundering herd just made a sharp U-turn. For more than two
decades, Merrill Lynch, the United States' biggest stock brokers,
scoffed at ``do it yourself'' discount investing.
</P>
<P>
   But recently even some of Merrill's well-heeled clients have
been lured by the excitement _ and far lower commissions _ of
trading for themselves on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   More than 6 million households now trade stocks over the
Internet, accounting for one in every seven stock trades in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   So the brokerage bent to the pressures of the Internet era and
said it would introduce a flat rate of $29.95 per trade on the
World Wide Web. Just don't ask for any advice.

   Barnes &AMP; Noble Withdraws Offer to Buy Ingram
</P>
<P>
   Barnes &AMP; Noble, the United States' biggest bookseller, decided
to withdraw its $600 million offer to buy Ingram Book Group, the
largest book wholesaler, after federal officials prepared to
challenge the deal on antitrust grounds.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was a victory for smaller bookstores, which have
grown dependent on Ingram. They had argued that they would be put
in a perilous position if their main competitor also owned their
primary supplier.

   Teamsters Strike Averted
</P>
<P>
   James P. Hoffa, the Teamsters' new president, had his first
chance to demonstrate that he could be a heavyweight at the
bargaining table like his famous father, James R. Hoffa. The
younger Hoffa received respectable marks for negotiating a contract
for 12,800 workers who haul new cars to dealers. In an era when
companies are cutting retirement benefits, he won higher pensions,
health coverage for workers who retire at age 55 and prescription
benefits for retirees over 65.

   Worries Over Muscle Drug
</P>
<P>
   Scientists were surprised _ and concerned. Iowa State University
researchers conducted tests on androstenedione, the drug Mark
McGwire said he used on his way to becoming baseball's home run
king. And around which a multimillion-dollar business sprang up on
claims that it builds muscle.
</P>
<P>
   In natural form, it converts to testosterone, which does build
muscle. The scientists put 30 young men on 100 milligrams, some on
placebos; some on weight training, some not. The finding: No
increase in testosterone or muscle, but increases in estrogen,
which can cause pancreatic cancer and heart disease in men. The
implication: a possible ban if larger studies corroborate the
findings.

guard, was a leading suspect in the bombing at the 1996 Summer

   Hillary Clinton Edges Closer
</P>
<P>
   The curtain lifted a few more inches on Hillary Rodham Clinton's
plans _ though not, it would seem, by the first lady's choice. Rep.
Nita Lowey, the Westchester County Democrat who had said she would
run for the Senate from New York if Mrs. Clinton did not, called
Mrs. Clinton to inform her that she was giving up and would instead
run for the House.
</P>
<P>
   And Mrs. Clinton did nothing to talk her out of it. If that

   New York's cultural resources seem unlimited, but if you ask a
New Yorker to name the greatest thing about living in the city, the
answer may not be the theater or the museums, but the takeout food.
With a telephone call, New Yorkers can get almost any kind of meal
delivered to their door, from sushi to tandoori chicken to pozole
to anything Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   The convenience is apparently worth the clutter of takeout menus
strewn about apartment vestibules, and the risk of being mowed down
by a speeding delivery bicycle.
</P>
<P>
   It was only a matter of time, then, before the growing
population of cellular-phone users would point some entrepreneur
toward the obvious. Sure enough, one Manhattan restaurant, It's a
Wrap, announced it would now take cell-phone orders from Central
Park, to be delivered by bicycle to four locations in the park. It
surely won't be the only restaurant to offer the service.
</P>
<P>
   Some may resent the intrusion of commerce and modern technology
into a bucolic domain of leisure. Yet Central Park is already full
of hot dog and ice cream vendors, cars racing back and forth on the
transverses with radios booming, crazed cyclists and in-line
skaters endangering any pedestrian who has a momentary lapse in
attention. It was fine for Thoreau to hole up and grow beans for a
year, but this is New York, for heaven's sake, and any perceived
right to pastoral pleasures is bowled over by the right to any
food, anywhere, anytime.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the restaurant's menu of tortilla-wrapped sandwiches
and smoothies is pretty good, which may help New Yorkers decide the
issue of nature vs. noshing. Meanwhile, beware of takeout menus
piled under rocks and stuffed into hollow trees.

   College. One little word that can make parents weep (if the joys
of the teen-age years haven't reduced them to tears already). They
hunch over calculators, muttering darkly that if they mortgage the
dog and wear designer hand-me-ups from the kids, maybe, just maybe,
they can pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   So it naturally follows, just as a request to take out the trash
is followed by the taking out of trash, that things will be tight,
fiscally speaking, for the educational duration.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, right. A new study shows that 45 percent of college
students spend more than $2,500 during the school year on
nonessentials _ movies, shopping, wheels _ and 19 percent spend an
astounding $5,000 or more. Officially, they're halfway out of
poverty, and they don't even need to buy bread or hire
electricians.
</P>
<P>
   The study, by EdVenture Partners, a marketing education firm in
Berkeley, Calif., also found that fully 31 percent of students
invest in financial markets. ``These students are caught in the
moment of a society fueled by a record stock market, by salaries
that are extreme,'' said Tony Sgro, EdVenture's president. ``They
look at their peers, and see the cars, the jewelry. They want a
lot.''
</P>
<P>
   As for investing, ``It's never too early,'' he said. ``Many
students don't think Social Security will be around.''
</P>
<P>
   But is this, perhaps, what the essayist Barbara Ehrenreich,
lamenting the too-rapid plunge ``from pubescence into the
stone-hearted world of finance capitalism,'' once labeled
``premature pragmatism''?
</P>
<P>
   Then again, they'd better start saving; who knows what their
kids will spend in college.

<TEXT>
<P>
   HANNIBAL, Mo. _ These are exquisite days to ride a bike in this
all-American, middle-American boyhood home of Mark Twain. Children
can ride to school, to the Tom Sawyer Cave a couple miles south of
town, to the banks of the Mississippi for fishing, or to a park to
play pitch and catch.
</P>
<P>
   They can and they did, but they don't any more. Hannibal's
parks, river banks and schools are all but barren of bikes. Plastic
riding toys cover the lawn of Ya Gotta Have It, a store that sells
secondhand toys, but the few bikes are stored in the back room. A
late-afternoon tour of a subdivision yielded two people on bikes
and four on riding lawn mowers.
</P>
<P>
   As vacation approached for the 350 pupils at Oakwood Elementary
School, only four bikes were parked outside. Kenneth Treaster,
principal of the 950-student Hannibal Middle School, said, ``I can
remember one kid riding a bike here in the three years I've been in
this building.''
</P>
<P>
   As Hannibal goes, so goes the nation. In the shadow of a long,
slow decline in cycling generally, the bicycle as a century-old
symbol of childhood freedom and transportation is nearly extinct.
</P>
<P>
   ``Biking as a form for children to get from one location to
another has become very, very rare,'' said Richard Killingsworth, a
health scientist for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 1 percent of children ages 7 to 15 ride bikes to
school, Killingsworth said, a precipitous and accelerating decline
of 60 percent to 70 percent since the 1970s. Only 2.5 percent of
those who live within two miles of school ride bikes there, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   For children, such analysts say, bicycles have been muscled
aside by parental fears of crime and traffic, tight scheduling of
organized play, television and computer games, and disappearing
sidewalks. This century's longest stretch of prosperity, with its
abundance of part-time jobs for teen-agers that have put
16-year-olds into cars, has conspired against bicycles, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was talking about it over the weekend,'' said Cathy Carver,
42, who was having coffee at the Mark Twain Dinette. At a garage
sale, she said, ``they had a black 10-speed for $2.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Thing of the past,'' said Greg Henderson, 43, a grain
inspector sitting at the counter beside Ms. Carver. ``Nintendo,''
he said. ``They'd rather do that than go out and ride a bike.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Carver has a daughter, 11. ``She's never had any desire to
have a bike,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now my daughter did,'' Henderson said. ``She had two bikes.
But by the time she got to 12, she was done. She hasn't rode a bike
since.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not that bicycles are disappearing. The industry reports
robust sales of mountain bikes to mostly adult riders, of
soft-saddled ``comfort'' bikes to aging baby boomers and of
recumbent bikes that let riders lie back to pedal.
</P>
<P>
   But over all, Huffy Corp., in Dayton, Ohio _ the United States'
largest bike maker _ reports that industry sales of bikes have
fallen from the levels of the 1970s and been flat at 15 million to
17 million for a decade. With the growth of the population, the per
capita decline is sharper.
</P>
<P>
   And fewer people use the bikes they have. Elliot Gluskin,
research director for Bicycling Magazine, said the number of riders
dropped to 43.5 million from 56.3 million just in the years from
1995 to 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are living in a much less friendly bicycle environment,''
said Tom Doyle, vice president for research at the National
Sporting Goods Association.
</P>
<P>
   There are few statistics on children who ride bikes. But no one
denies that the number of young bike-riders has declined.
</P>
<P>
   Not so long ago, Diane Colbert, 38, and her husband, Jerry, 40,
were glued to their bikes. Growing up in Bowling Green, 30 miles
south of Hannibal, Ms. Colbert said: ``I had a 10-speed. I rode 15
to 20 miles a day. I was everywhere on my bike. You didn't have to
worry who was out when.''
</P>
<P>
   But these days, safety is a big issue. The Colberts and their
son, Jaron, 12, were holding a garage sale at their small ranch
house in a sidewalk-free subdivision of Hannibal, and Jaron was
trying to sell his bike, which he has outgrown, for $15.
</P>
<P>
   He would like another bike but can live without one. ``I'd like
to ride to the place where I play baseball'' two miles away, he
said. ``But there's the traffic.'' So his mother drives him.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Dylan Mardis, 9, who lives in another subdivision, has two bikes
_ one he uses and one he has outgrown that a friend comes over to
ride. His father, David Mardis, 45, said that as a child in Des
Moines, Iowa, he rode a bike a mile to school every day. ``I'd ride
all over town,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dylan said, ``I ride, too, every day.'' But he is not allowed
off his own block, where his parents know all the residents. Mardis
said: ``Parents are so distrustful of what society has done to
children. Maybe that's paranoid, but it's real.''
</P>
<P>
   Such parental concerns, widespread in Hannibal, may be
overdrawn. No one seems to know of statistics showing crime
involving bicycles, other than thefts, which have been declining
far more than the decline in bike riding. The FBI reports 318
bicycle thefts for every 10,000 Americans in 1980 compared with 165
per 10,000 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In part because of the growing use of helmets, fewer people are
dying on bikes. In a typical year, 2 percent of traffic fatalities
involve bicycle riders.
</P>
<P>
   The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety says that bicycle
deaths fell to 808 in 1997 from 965 in 1980, exceeding the fall in
bicycle sales. It says deaths involving riders under 16 have fallen
far more, to 31 percent of all bike-riding fatalities in 1997 from
55 percent in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   In Hannibal, too, accidents are far more common for automobiles.
The Police Department reports about 900 traffic accidents a year.
``We've had a couple involving bikes,'' Police Chief Albert Higdon
said. ``But they're few and far between.''
</P>
<P>
   But Higdon is leery, too, about his daughters, ages 9, 10 and
16. ``I won't let them go off on a bike without my knowing where
they're at. I don't like them crossing a major highway.''
</P>
<P>
   Pat Janes, the principal of Oakwood Elementary, questions
whether safety is a big issue with many of his pupils' parents.
</P>
<P>
   Half his pupils live more than a mile from school, he said, and
are eligible for busing. Some who live closer walk. But so many are
driven by parents that he said he has had to start dismissing those
children five minutes early to avert congestion with the buses.
</P>
<P>
   Tight scheduling of after-school activities, for soccer,
baseball, horseback riding, piano lessons and dance classes,
precludes riding bikes from one to the other. Beyond that, Janes
said: ``Bicycles just don't seem popular. It might just be they
need too much effort. Or maybe Mom wants her kids to sleep later.''
</P>
<P>
   With vans now shuttling them to school and playgrounds, and
computer games to amuse them at home, children are getting fat.
Killingsworth at the Centers for Disease Control, said 22 percent
of American children are obese, twice the level of the mid-1980s.
Nutrition is a factor, but so is physical inactivity. With parents
taking children to school, he said, ``they're not even walking to a
bus stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Ross Brownson, an epidemiologist at the School of Public Health
at St. Louis University, said, ``Technology has engineered physical
activity out of our lives.'' Highways and subdivisions have been
engineered to accommodate cars, not walking or bike riding.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to find a way to make our communities more friendly to
physical activity,'' Brownson said. ``Bring back sidewalks and
wider shoulders on the sides of roads and parks.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: A word on behalf of pork barrel politics
 &HT;    For release June 9, 1999.
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Perhaps it's time to take another, softer look at pork barrel
politics, that long-deprecated practice of Washington lawmakers
bringing the bacon to the folks back home.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, it was not a custom I favored (except when it
came to my own ZIP code), but you might say I have been bombed back
to reality.
</P>
<P>
   When Bill Clinton asked the Congress for $6 billion to prosecute
the war in Yugoslavia, the GOP-dominated body told the president
that it was not enough: ``Here, take $12 billion,'' was the
collective response.
</P>
<P>
   Another $6 billion had been found so easily and quickly and it
just makes you wonder how big the pile of money is that Congress
sits upon and, in turn, why all the carping about pork barrel
politics?
</P>
<P>
   What is all that wrong with a piece of bacon for, say,
Pascagoula, Miss., to keep hundreds of Americans on the job at the
shipbuilding yard there? Why is it wasteful to provide a
billion-dollar loan program for embattled American steel companies?
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, there seem to be many abuses. Such as $750,000
for grasshopper research in Alaska. That sounds ridiculous to us,
but what do we know about it? Are grasshoppers destroying whatever
crops there are in Alaska? Are they impacting the economy severely?
Is it meaningful to the people of Alaska, whose taxes go to
Washington to be part of doubling the appropriation for bombing
Yugoslavia?
</P>
<P>
   News stories talk about red-faced legislators sorting through
fine print and finding pork in the form of a $4 million grant for a
forestry research center at Auburn University in Alabama, and $5
million for a law enforcement academy in New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, none of it's in my back yard. But I sure wasn't
carping when those federal funds were pouring into my area, South
Florida, more than a decade ago to build a rapid transit system
that Ronald Reagan, as president, continually ridiculed. (He said
he could have hired limousines for all the riders and spent less
money in doing so.)
</P>
<P>
   What pork barrel does is return to states, cities,
neighborhoods, some of the taxes that were sent up to Washington
that are sitting around doing nothing else _ or we wouldn't have $6
billion extra available to double the president's request.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't about whether we should or should not wage battle
with the Serbs, it's about money _ where it is, where it's been
hiding and who should get it _ or at least some of it.
</P>
<P>
   One can go down a list of what social programs can be helped
immeasurably by a boost of $6 billion and come up with dozens.
</P>
<P>
   Was that rainy-day money the president and the Congress gave
away? If a part of the U.S. is ravaged by a hurricane, a flood and
an earthquake, will there be enough money left in Uncle Sam's piggy
bank to help out, or did it all go to the bombs for Yugoslavia?
</P>
<P>
   I'm quite certain that beyond the $6 billion, there's plenty
left.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings me back to those pork barrel projects,
appropriations slipped into legislation by lawmakers trying to do
something for the folks who sent them up to Capitol Hill, the
constituents.
</P>
<P>
   As time and change ravage what had been their incomes and
industries, a little boost from the piggy bank is pretty important
to them. Especially when you know that $12 billion can be plucked
out of the air to fight a foreign war.
</P>
<P>
   And since we've got all that surplus, I must ask, whatever
happened to that hefty tax cut the young GOP crusaders were going
to get us?

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Sensible ruling on school sexual harassment
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The recent common-sense Supreme Court ruling on schoolhouse
sexual harassment has driven even normally sane conservatives into
great curlicues of loopiness, composed in about equal parts of
ridicule, outrage and panic.
</P>
<P>
   The court held that in especially aggravated cases, parents can
sue a school for failing to take reasonable steps to stop egregious
sexual harassment by a classmate. The Georgia case involved a
fifth-grade girl who, she says, was for months groped, grabbed and
sexually taunted by a boy. The girl's mother says the school failed
to respond usefully to her repeated pleas for intervention.
</P>
<P>
   Whether all of this is true can now be worked out in a civil
suit. The fact that the boy eventually pleaded guilty to sexual
battery gives provisional credence to the complaint.
</P>
<P>
   It would seem almost self-evident that schools, which after all
exist for the welfare of their students, could be held to account
when they are in negligent or willful default in that stewardship.
The court agreed, though thinly, 5 to 4.
</P>
<P>
   Mind you, this is a conservative court. The dissenting four are
simply more conservative than the conservative majority.
</P>
<P>
   Yet you'd think the gates of a liberal hell had been loosed and
left-wing devils set free. This, as some commentators have it, is
political correctness run amok. Schools will be bankrupted if a boy
chases a girl on the playground, and the boy will be branded a
harasser for life. Flirtation will go to court _ and flirts to
juvie hall? Blowing a kiss will be forbidden. If unwanted advances
are actionable, isn't it just a matter of time until courts flip
the coin and let rejected suitors sue for the emotional hurt of the
rejection?
</P>
<P>
   And on and on.
</P>
<P>
   Give the eagerly worried two points: Piranha lawyers will swarm
to this new blood, as if we weren't litigious enough already. And
school administrations, which as a rule are not the first place you
look for intelligence, are perfectly capable of turning overwrought
legal worries into idiot codes of conduct. We all remember with a
cringe the fool North Carolina principal who kicked out a
6-year-old boy as a sexual harasser for kissing a little girl on
her cheek.
</P>
<P>
   Parental, voter and PTA prudence can control the latter impulse,
and the court emphasized it was not licensing the former.
</P>
<P>
   Sandra Day O'Connor, writing for the majority, said that to be
liable a school must have ``actual knowledge'' of ``severe,
pervasive and objective harassment'' and show ``deliberate
indifference'' to it. And the misbehavior must be so severe it
impairs its victim's learning.
</P>
<P>
   These are very high bars. The lawyer for the National School
Boards Association _ believe me, no lefty outfit _ says such
occasions will be rare.
</P>
<P>
   No one, certainly not the court majority, holds that schools
should be liable for the inchoate sexuality of childhood. Equally,
though, schools should not be in the business of teaching, by their
forfeit, that it is the lot of girls to put up, abandoned, with
gross and open-ended sexual imposition.

BUBBLE-GUM GODDESS: BRITNEY SPEARS AND THE MAKING OF AN ADOLESCENT
IDOL 
</HEADLINE>

entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.)

 (Includes a color slide of pop singer Britney Spears.) 
 By GARY GRAFF  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    They may be making her into a teen idol, but Britney Spears
isn't taking it lying down.
 &HT;    Actually, she was for a while, but she's back on her feet now,
and she isn't letting controversy stand in her way.
 &HT;    While the 17-year-old singer was convalescing from a dislocated
left leg, injured while stretching before a dance rehearsal for a
video, her debut album, ``Baby One More Time,'' spent four of the
first six weeks after its January release at No. 1 atop the
Billboard charts, selling nearly 200,000 copies a week.
 &HT;    You couldn't turn on the radio without hearing Spears' first
single, the album's title track. Meanwhile, overnight its
midriff-baring video turned Spears into a sex symbol for the
pubescent set.
 &HT;    Needless to say, it made the pain of her injury a lot more
bearable.
 &HT;    ``I'm, like, really thankful, really, really happy about
everything,'' the Kentwood, La., native says. ``I never really
expected for it to go to No. 1. With the single doing so well, I
was just going to be happy if it went on the charts at, like, No.
47 or something.
 &HT;    ``When they called and told me, I was sleeping,'' she adds, ``so
I thought they meant the single went to No. 1. Then they said, `No,
your album,' and I was completely overwhelmed. I called everyone.''
 &HT;    At the same time, Spears says she isn't surprised that her music
has found a ready market, especially in the wake of young, male
vocal groups such as the Backstreet Boys and 'N Sync.
 &HT;    ``That is on the radio all the time,'' she says. ``I think
people feel it would be nice to hear a change, to hear a girl
sound. I think the audience, the public, wants to hear it.''
 &HT;    Her success may have come overnight, but Spears didn't exactly
come out of nowhere. She's been singing publicly since kindergarten
_ shyly, she adds _ and plowed through the talent-contest circuit
as a tot. Her first show-business audition was for ``The Mickey
Mouse Club'' at age 8. Told she was too young, Spears moved to New
York, where she studied at the Off-Broadway Dance Center and the
Professional Performing Arts School, filmed some television
commercials and appeared in the hit Off-Broadway comedy
``Ruthless.''
 &HT;    Three years later, she was finally accepted to ``The Mickey
Mouse Club,'' on which she appeared for two years with future 'N
Sync members Justin Timberlake and J.C. Chasez. It was a good
connection to make _ Spears later opened for the group on a tour
prior to her album's release.
 &HT;    Even now, Spears appreciates what ``The Mickey Mouse Club'' did
for her.
 &HT;    ``We got to sing, dance and act,'' Spears says. ``That's when I
realized I love to sing the best and I love to perform, and that's
what I really wanted to focus on.''
 &HT;    After the show's sudden cancellation, Spears _ who has two
siblings, ``so cute'' 8-year-old Jamie Lynn and 21-year-old Bryan,
who she says is on the protective side _ returned to Kentwood for a
``normal'' year of school. That's normal, as opposed to her touring
schedule, when she's accompanied by an adult friend of the family
as chaperon/tutor.
 &HT;    At the end of the school year she headed back to New York, where
she landed a deal with Jive Records in short order. The company
hooked her up with producers Eric Foster and Max Martin. Martin, a
Backstreet Boys veteran, wrote ``Baby One More Time,'' and as soon
as Jive executives played the song for her, Spears smelled a hit.
 &HT;    ``I went into the office, and all of a sudden they have this
song and I'm totally blown away,'' she recalls. ``I was totally
flattered Max Martin would allow me to sing that song.''
 &HT;    The song certainly kicked doors open for Spears, though it
raised a number of other issues as well. The lyrics of her songs
are mildly suggestive at most, but her videos and photo sessions
have made her as much a teen-dream pinup as any of her male
counterparts.
 &HT;    A brazen, cheesecake spread for a recent Rolling Stone story
drew controversy over its use of schoolgirl props to accompany
highly seductive poses, and a recent television appearance on a
Nickelodeon awards show drew criticism _ and at least one sponsor
withdrawal _ over Spears' performance, clearly without a bra.
 &HT;    The combination of overt sexuality and preteen ambiance has
troubled many observers, but Spears says she's comfortable with her
role as a sex symbol.
 &HT;    ``The first time I saw that there were even guys that were
interested was when I went down to MTV to do the request thing, and
there were so many guys down there,'' says Spears, who's currently
without a boyfriend. ``I'd never seen that, because I'm so used to
opening for 'N Sync and seeing all these girls.
 &HT;    ``And all of a sudden I went to MTV and there were all these
guys and it hit me, `Oh my goodness!'
 &HT;    ``It's cute and flattering,'' she says, ``because they have
their little shirts, all saying `Can you go to the prom with me?'
It's really cute ... But I think after a while it'll probably be
annoying.''
 &HT;    Even now, Spears adds, it's caused her to become a bit more wary
about who she hangs out with, though she spends most of her time
with people who were friends before she became a pop sensation.
 &HT;    ``When I come home I see my main friends,'' she says, ``but I
really don't tell anybody I'm coming home, because if I did I'd
have to go visit 9 million people. So I just kind of sneak home and
totally relax.
 &HT;    ``My sister's little friends, when they're over here, it's like
really weird,'' the singer adds, ``because they'll see me and come
and give me a really big hug, and they're, like, staring at you.
It's kind of funny.''
 &HT;    This summer will bring Spears' closest encounter with her fans
to date, as she mounts her first tour as a headliner _ a
song-and-dance extravaganza with a full band, rather than the taped
backup she performed to when she toured with 'N Sync.
 &HT;    With tickets selling out nationwide _ thanks in part to
producers' decision to book smaller theaters rather than arenas _
the tour shows all the signs of being yet another high point in
what has so far been a remarkably easy climb to the top.
 &HT;    ``I guess it has been, yeah,'' Spears acknowledges. ``The worst
thing about the business, I think, is just the traveling and being
overseas and being so far away from home. But other than that, I
haven't really experienced anything really bad.''

FOR THE RECORD: JENNIFER LOPEZ HAS MUSIC ON HER MIND

 (Includes a color slide of Jennifer Lopez from her album, ``On the
6.'') 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Let's assume that Jennifer Lopez can sing. It isn't enough that
she's a gorgeous movie star, famous and rich beyond most people's
wildest dreams _ the highest-paid Latina in Hollywood _ so let's
assume that she can sing, too.
 &HT;    What would she sing?
 &HT;    Well, to judge by her just-released debut album, ``On the 6,''
she'd sing an exhilarating mix of rhythm-and-blues songs plus dance
grooves. She'd even co-write three of the cuts.
 &HT;    That's right _ let's assume that Jennifer Lopez can write songs.
 &HT;    ``The music is a little like me,'' the actress-turned-singer
says. ``It's street, but there is also a soft side.''
 &HT;    The dominant voice on the album is that of a young woman fired
by determination to get everything life has to offer.
 &HT;    ``If I had to describe myself in one word, it would be `strong'
_ I've always wanted to sing and I always go after what I want,''
says the 29-year-old star of the films ``Selena'' (1997) and ``Out
of Sight'' (1998).
 &HT;    The Bronx-born Lopez says that ``On the 6'' is intensely
personal, right down to its title.
 &HT;    ``The 6 is a train I used to take from the Bronx into Manhattan
for music and dance lessons,'' she says. ``It's my journey. But
what I love about the title is that the 6 is also a way to get back
home.''
 &HT;    The release of her first album comes as no surprise to her fans.
Lopez fell in love with singing after playing the title role in the
movie ``Selena'' _ though she was allowed only to lip-sync to the
slain superstar's own recordings.
 &HT;    But Lopez was serious enough about singing to invest her own
money to cut a demo record in Spanish and submit it to Sony's
specialty Work label. They loved it, but had a suggestion. Why not
sing the songs in English, to add crossover appeal?
 &HT;    Lopez didn't mind, though the Spanish market alone can be enough
to launch a hit CD. By 2009 Latinos will be the largest minority
group in the United States. American sales of Latin music neared
$600 million in 1998, and are 46 percent higher this year.
 &HT;    But the novice singer relished the chance to reach non-Hispanic
audiences, which she says are increasingly open to Latin music.
 &HT;    ``I think people are really getting into this music because the
passion of it is undeniable,'' Lopez says. ``I want to introduce
people to music with a Latin flavor. I'll throw in a line where you
can learn about my people. I want to throw in a little Spanish
guitar and bongo.''
 &HT;    Singing connects her with something inside herself, Lopez adds.
 &HT;    ``My mom used to take me to dance class at age 5,'' she recalls,
``but I was much more interested in the singing. I studied acting,
but deep in my heart I always wanted to sing. It is my first love _
I think with music you can truly offer something beautiful.''
 &HT;    Of course, she isn't quitting her day job as a movie star. In
films such as ``Money Train'' (1995), ``Anaconda'' (1997), ``Blood
and Wine'' (1997) and ``U-Turn'' (1997), Lopez has captivated
moviegoers with her in-your-face, fiery charm.
 &HT;    In the process, she's brought a welcome Latina presence to a
film industry which for most of its history has been a whites-only
preserve. Growing up in the Bronx, daughter of a kindergarten
teacher and a computer specialist, Lopez's favorite film featured a
Latina character played by the very Caucasian Natalie Wood.
 &HT;    ``I sat through `West Side Story' about 37 times,'' she says,
``because it was the only movie about my people.''
 &HT;    Lopez saw herself in the classic 1961 film, but not in its
heroine. She preferred the peppery character played by Rita Moreno.
 &HT;    ``I never wanted to be that wimpy Maria, who sits around pining
for her guy,'' she recalls. ``Who needs it? I wanted to be Anita,
who danced her way to the top.''
 &HT;    Dancing worked for Lopez, who was only 21 when she was hired as
a Fly Girl on television's ``In Living Color.'' Her big-screen
debut came in Gregory Nava's ``My Family'' (1995), when she was 25.
 &HT;    ``I've always wanted to do things fast,'' Lopez says. ``It's
like I have a fire in me.''
 &HT;    Only two years later, her role as the slain Tejano star Selena
put her on the map.
 &HT;    ``Ever since playing her, I've had people come up and say, `Look
what you've done for our people _ you've given us a part of our
hero back,''' Lopez says. ``That has been extremely rewarding.''
 &HT;    Last summer she scored in a sexy turn opposite George Clooney in
``Out of Sight.'' She still gets asked about the extended scene in
which she and the ``E.R.'' star got up close and personal in a car
trunk _ and talked about old movies, not only in the film but in
real life.
 &HT;    ``The trunk was pretty cramped and uncomfortable,'' she recalls.
``We would lie there in the dark and talk about movies between
takes. Part of you couldn't wait for it to be over.''
 &HT;    Lopez may make movies and CDs, but much of the press seems most
interested in her love life, particularly following the end of her
brief marriage to waiter-turned-club-manager Ojani Noa. A
persistent rumor has linked her with rapper Sean ``Puff Daddy''
Combs.
 &HT;    ``We're just friends,'' Lopez says with a sigh. ``The gossip is
horrible, but I don't want to defend myself.''
 &HT;    In a way, she says, her marriage, which took place just before
the success of ``Selena,'' protected her from the full impact of
stardom.
 &HT;    ``Now it's weird,'' she says. ``I'm single. So if I show up in a
club and I'm there with Oscar de la Hoya or Puff Daddy, it's news _
I read that I'm dating these men. Meanwhile, I'm wondering, `Can't
I just talk to people anymore without it being a big thing?'''
 &HT;    The flip side of her fame is that, especially since winning
critical acclaim in a non-ethnic role in ``Out of Sight,'' Lopez is
finding her way out of the typecasting that threatens most minority
performers.
 &HT;    ``Now I get roles that just say `the woman' and not `the
Hispanic woman,''' she says. ``I love movies where race doesn't
come up even once _ I can do a role and people won't even think
about it. And that's the way it should be.''
 &HT;    Otherwise, she says, the perks of stardom are overrated.
 &HT;    ``You know, I don't have any habits,'' she says. ``I don't
smoke, I don't drink, I don't do cars or houses.''
 &HT;    Well, maybe she has one habit, she admits, raising a stylish
foot onto a nearby chair. When it comes to buying shoes, she could
give Imelda Marcos a few pointers. And making movie-star money does
come in handy that way.
 &HT;    ``The day you buy your first pair of $500 Dolce &AMP; Gabbana shoes,
you're like, `Ohhhh, I'm in heaven,''' Lopez purrs. ``I don't even
wear some of these shoes _ I save them. I just look at them.''

 By ANDREW RYAN  
 c.1999 TV Guide Canada  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Talking about Sarah McLachlan these days, the phrase that people
keep coming back to is ``one-woman industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider her workload: Most people would be content with her
upcoming special for Canadian television and her new live album,
``The Mirror Ball,'' to be released June 15. But McLachlan also
recently co-authored the cookbook ``Plenty,'' and is currently
preparing for her third tour with Lilith Fair, the annual summer
music festival she created and still runs. Lilith is set for more
than 40 North American dates, starting in July and ending in time
for her to catch her breath before a mini-Lilith tour of Australia
in December.
</P>
<P>
   And, oh yes, on top of all that Sarah McLachlan is trying to
have a baby.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a wee bit crazy,'' she admits with a laugh. ``I seem to
like piling the stuff on lately. I guess I've just gotten used to
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be the third and final Lilith,'' she says. ``We had
a three-year plan right from the beginning, just because we knew
how much work was involved to make it happen. It's incredibly
rewarding, but it's an awful lot of work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides, we're all sort of selfish now,'' McLachlan adds.
``We're all in our 30s, and we want to have kids. So it was Lilith
or kids. You can't do both _ it's too much work.''
</P>
<P>
   The 31-year-old singer is quick to point out, however, that
she's hardly shopping for baby clothes just yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't plan for my life to stop as soon as I get pregnant,''
she says firmly, ``and that's if I get pregnant.''
</P>
<P>
   McLachlan is as refreshingly direct in person as she is in her
music. For example, she says she doesn't spend a lot of time
reading her clippings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once I say things, I don't tend to read much of my own press
or anything,'' she says. ``I already said it, so why would I do
that? I think it's amusing, generally, that people are so
interested in me.''
</P>
<P>
   That same cut-to-the-chase frankness jumps off the screen in
McLachlan's television special, which combines performances of
close to a dozen of her favorite songs _ filmed last year before a
capacity crowd in Portland, Ore. _ with candid backstage footage
and interviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really exciting to film this special,'' she says.
``There were eight cameras whizzing around the whole time. It helps
things when you're being filmed and being immortalized _ you damn
well do a good job. So there's definitely a higher level of
excitement than normal. It raises the stakes.''
</P>
<P>
   McLachlan is coming off what by any standards would have to
count as a bizarre year. For one thing, she found herself in court
being sued over songwriting credits on four songs from her first
album, ``Touch,'' in a case since settled out of court.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was her surreal-if-peripheral involvement in the
recent White House sex scandal, in which Kenneth Starr's report to
Congress revealed that McLachlan's music played a part in the
affair between Bill Clinton and White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
Both the president and the intern identified with McLachlan's
haunting, romantic lyrics, the Starr report said, and the two
discussed them at length.
</P>
<P>
   Even by the standards of rock 'n' roll, that was a strange thing
to have happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all just so funny to me,'' McLachlan says, laughing. ``I
missed a lot of that because I was in England at the time. The
story hit just when I got to London, so people started asking me
about it. But it was all secondhand to me _ I kind of missed that
whole thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The president and his mistress are far from McLachlan's only
fans _ she's had four gold records and a five-year streak of top-40
hits such as ``Sweet Surrender,'' ``I Will Remember You'' and
``Surfacing.'' In her own quiet way, the Canadian-born singer ranks
right up there with Celine, Shania and Alanis among the top female
exports from north of the border.
</P>
<P>
   Proof of McLachlan's mainstream appeal came in May, when her
wrenching love song ``I Will Remember You'' was featured in its
entirety in the season finales of both ``Melrose Place'' and
``Felicity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I always say there's a lot of creative license involved in
these songs,'' McLachlan says, ``but often there's a lot of me in
them as well. People are always asking me what a song is about, and
I'll say to them, `What does it mean to you?' Because that's what's
important.''
</P>
<P>
   McLachlan's own life, which has had its share of troubles, fuels
her music. She grew up in Halifax, Nova Scotia, as a skinny,
introverted girl who studied piano and guitar. An adoptee, she
didn't meet her birth mother until she was 19, around the same time
that she signed her first record contract, with the renegade
Canadian label Nettwerk Records.
</P>
<P>
   The hits started coming fast and furious, and all of a sudden
the young singer was on MTV, magazine covers and ``The Tonight Show
with Jay Leno.'' McLachlan struck a particular chord with Leno _
she'll make her ninth appearance on June 18, singing ``I Will
Remember'' to boost the live CD.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're just so sweet to me,'' McLachlan says of the ``Tonight
Show'' crew. ``They keep asking me back. And it's a great
promotional tool _ you get a huge TV audience, and that's always a
good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Given her wide-eyed beauty and wholesome presence, it's not
surprising that McLachlan has already been approached by Hollywood
types interested in steering her onto the big screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are phoning me up about it these days,'' she
says dubiously. ``I don't know about the acting thing. I'd probably
start laughing. I don't know if I could do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, it's not as if McLachlan were looking for anything more
to pencil into her already crowded schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``October is looking rather free right now,'' she says
hopefully, ``and I'm hoping to keep it that way.''
</P>
<P>
   She and her husband/drummer, Ashwin Sood, recently bought their
dream house in North Vancouver, British Columbia. Until Lilith
kicks into full gear in July, McLachlan says she's happy to simply
hang out there and get to know the area between Lilith planning
sessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday, I hiked in the mountains,'' she says excitedly,
``and there was like 20 feet of snow. Then I drove 15 minutes back
to Vancouver and swam in my pool, because it was sunny and warm.
It's unbelievable to have those two worlds so close together.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a great world in which to raise a child, she thinks, and
with all the complexities involved in her ever-expanding music
empire, McLachlan admits that that's mostly where her thoughts are
these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been thinking about being a mom,'' she says quietly.
``I've thought about that a lot.''

HAIL TO THE CHEF: ISAAC HAYES ON `SOUTH PARK,' `SHAFT,' MUSIC AND
MORE 
</HEADLINE>

entertainment package.)

 (Includes a color slide of actor/singer Isaac Hayes.) 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Call him an entertainer.
 &HT;    ``That pretty much encapsulates the whole thing,'' Isaac Hayes
says. ``I don't say I'm a 
composer/writer/arranger/musician/producer/DJ/voiceover-person/actor
.
 &HT;    ``Just saying I'm an entertainer covers it all,'' he says, ``and
I've been at it for 40 years. I paid my dues and worked hard. I've
had my ups and downs and my setbacks, and I'm still in it.''
 &HT;    Blessed with a voice that's deep, silky and soulful, Hayes has
sold millions of albums, winning two Grammys and an Oscar for ``The
Theme from Shaft'' in 1972. He's also acted in 28 movies, including
``Truck Turner'' (1974) and ``It Could Happen to You'' (1994), and
guest-starred on television shows ranging from ``The A-Team'' to
``The Rockford Files.''
 &HT;    These days, the 56-year-old multiple-threat artist is enjoying
an unlikely surge in popularity with college students and preteens,
thanks to his role as Chef, the libidinous, crooning cook in Comedy
Central's still-hot, still-controversial animated series, ``South
Park.''
 &HT;    The show centers on the rude, potty-mouthed escapades of Kenny,
Cartman, Kyle and Stan, third-grade boys with a fondness for
flatulence, sex, death and anal probes. As Chef, Hayes provides the
show's only modestly cool adult presence.
 &HT;    But the small screen is only the beginning. On June 18, ``South
Park'' creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone _ along with Hayes and
guest voices Eric Idle, George Clooney and Minnie Driver _ reach
for the brass ring with a big-screen enterprise entitled ``South
Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut.''
 &HT;    ``I'd never done animation before,'' Hayes says by cellular
telephone while on the road somewhere in New York. ``I actually
always wanted to do it, and had my sights set on a more Disneylike
type of animation.
 &HT;    ``I never imagined that I'd be doing this cartoon for television
that would become a movie,'' he says. ```South Park' just hit, and
it caught everybody by surprise.
 &HT;    ``Chef is a lovable character,'' he adds. ``He's endearing to a
lot of women and men _ men because he says things they want to say
and women because he's very candid. He'll say, `I'll make sweet
love, right now.'
 &HT;    ``I think of Chef as my alter-ego.''
 &HT;    Hayes chuckles, but ``South Park's'' popularity is no laughing
matter for the many infuriated parents who blame the show for
corrupting America's children. One kid, in a much-reported
incident, even set a fire after watching an episode two years ago.
 &HT;    Hayes, a thrice-divorced father of 11 children and grandfather
of 14, argues that those pointing fingers should actually be
peering long and hard into a mirror.
 &HT;    ```South Park' is an adult cartoon, totally an adult cartoon,''
he says. ``Adults love it, but kids got ahold of it. It's up to the
parents to not allow kids to see it.
 &HT;    ``Parents let kids see it,'' he says. ``I've got parents
bringing kids to me to sign autographs on all sorts of `South Park'
paraphernalia. What do you do? What do you say?
 &HT;    ``Kids are not stupid,'' he adds, warming to his topic.
``They're people. Treat them like little people. They know right
from wrong.''
 &HT;    Hayes is on a roll.
 &HT;    ``When we were kids, we said `s--t' and `f--k' behind the backs
of our parents, our teachers and our preachers,'' he says. ``We did
all of that, and most of us didn't turn out too bad.
 &HT;    ``So kids know. You've got to give them credit.''
 &HT;    Beyond ``South Park,'' Hayes has several other irons in the
fire, including radio, music and movie ventures, as well as a pet
charitable cause.
 &HT;    ``I've got a radio show on KISS in New York that I do five days
a week, and I'm doing some acting,'' he says. ``I'm in `Reindeer
Games' with Ben Affleck, Gary Sinise and Clarence Williams, which
John Frankenheimer directed _ I play a crazy man in a prison.
 &HT;    ``I did a song for the `South Park' soundtrack,'' he continues,
``and I'm working on my own CD, which I hope will be out in 2000.
I'll be doing a few concert appearances during the summer, and I'm
also the international spokesperson for the World Literacy
Crusade'' _ an effort to ease poverty, crime and hopelessness by
increasing literacy in inner cities around the world.
 &HT;    ``I'm busy,'' he sums up. ``I'm working seven days a week,
practically.''
 &HT;    That wasn't always the case, however. Not long ago, Hayes felt
as if the world had passed him by.
 &HT;    ``The lowest point was in the 1980s,'' he says. ``Record
companies turned on classic soul artists and left us hanging out to
dry to go with the hip-hop generation. It turns out the hip-hop
guys were sampling us so much that they had to turn back to us and
give us our props.
 &HT;    ``I didn't mind things being hard in my early days, when I was
starting out,'' he adds. ``Everybody's got to come out of
nonexistence. You've got to take on challenges and make a lot of
sacrifices, but victory is sweet when you come by it that way.
 &HT;    ``It was tougher to deal with being abandoned by the record
companies,'' Hayes admits. ``But things are all right now. They are
all right.''
 &HT;    As the old saying has it, what goes around comes around, so it's
no surprise that a new version of ``Shaft'' is in the works, to
star Samuel L. Jackson under the direction of John Singleton. Hayes
may be involved in the film _ acting, handling the music or doing
both _ but nothing has been decided.
 &HT;    ``John and I have spoken several times, but he plays his cards
close to the chest,'' Hayes says. ``He doesn't make any kind of
commitment. If they use me to do the music, that'll be fine. John
knows where to reach me, but I won't hold my breath.
 &HT;    ``I do like the idea of redoing `Shaft,''' he admits. ``It was
such a huge success, and it initiated a lot of things for a lot of
people in the 1970s. But it's got to have a very powerful script,
because there have been so many great action movies since `Shaft'
came out.''
 &HT;    As the conversation comes to an end, Hayes' thoughts flit back
to Covington, Tenn., the small town in which he was born. To him it
represents both his past and, quite possibly, his future.
 &HT;    ``Every now and again I go back there,'' he says warmly. ``I
look at the land where I was born. There used to be a tin-top house
where I lived. That was my beginnings, and I have fond memories of
those days. They stay with me and they keep my feet on the
ground.''
 &HT;    He pauses in thought.
 &HT;    ``That area is growing fast now,'' Hayes says, ``and I was
thinking of going back there, buying me some property and building
myself a farm or a ranch. I like life in the city, but I'm a
country boy at heart.''

BUBBLE-GUM GODDESS: BRITNEY SPEARS AND THE MAKING OF AN ADOLESCENT
IDOL

entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not

 (Includes a color slide of pop singer Britney Spears.) 
 By GARY GRAFF  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    They may be making her into a teen idol, but Britney Spears
isn't taking it lying down.
 &HT;    Actually, she was for a while, but she's back on her feet now,
and she isn't letting controversy stand in her way.
 &HT;    While the 17-year-old singer was convalescing from a dislocated
left leg, injured while stretching before a dance rehearsal for a
video, her debut album, ``Baby One More Time,'' spent four of the
first six weeks after its January release at No. 1 atop the
Billboard charts, selling nearly 200,000 copies a week.
 &HT;    You couldn't turn on the radio without hearing Spears' first
single, the album's title track. Meanwhile, overnight its
midriff-baring video turned Spears into a sex symbol for the
pubescent set.
 &HT;    Needless to say, it made the pain of her injury a lot more
bearable.
 &HT;    ``I'm, like, really thankful, really, really happy about
everything,'' the Kentwood, La., native says. ``I never really
expected for it to go to No. 1. With the single doing so well, I
was just going to be happy if it went on the charts at, like, No.
47 or something.
 &HT;    ``When they called and told me, I was sleeping,'' she adds, ``so
I thought they meant the single went to No. 1. Then they said, `No,
your album,' and I was completely overwhelmed. I called everyone.''
 &HT;    At the same time, Spears says she isn't surprised that her music
has found a ready market, especially in the wake of young, male
vocal groups such as the Backstreet Boys and 'N Sync.
 &HT;    ``That is on the radio all the time,'' she says. ``I think
people feel it would be nice to hear a change, to hear a girl
sound. I think the audience, the public, wants to hear it.''
 &HT;    Her success may have come overnight, but Spears didn't exactly
come out of nowhere. She's been singing publicly since kindergarten
_ shyly, she adds _ and plowed through the talent-contest circuit
as a tot. Her first show-business audition was for ``The Mickey
Mouse Club'' at age 8. Told she was too young, Spears moved to New
York, where she studied at the Off-Broadway Dance Center and the
Professional Performing Arts School, filmed some television
commercials and appeared in the hit Off-Broadway comedy
``Ruthless.''
 &HT;    Three years later, she was finally accepted to ``The Mickey
Mouse Club,'' on which she appeared for two years with future 'N
Sync members Justin Timberlake and J.C. Chasez. It was a good
connection to make _ Spears later opened for the group on a tour
prior to her album's release.
 &HT;    Even now, Spears appreciates what ``The Mickey Mouse Club'' did
for her.
 &HT;    ``We got to sing, dance and act,'' Spears says. ``That's when I
realized I love to sing the best and I love to perform, and that's
what I really wanted to focus on.''
 &HT;    After the show's sudden cancellation, Spears _ who has two
siblings, ``so cute'' 8-year-old Jamie Lynn and 21-year-old Bryan,
who she says is on the protective side _ returned to Kentwood for a
``normal'' year of school. That's normal, as opposed to her touring
schedule, when she's accompanied by an adult friend of the family
as chaperon/tutor.
 &HT;    At the end of the school year she headed back to New York, where
she landed a deal with Jive Records in short order. The company
hooked her up with producers Eric Foster and Max Martin. Martin, a
Backstreet Boys veteran, wrote ``Baby One More Time,'' and as soon
as Jive executives played the song for her, Spears smelled a hit.
 &HT;    ``I went into the office, and all of a sudden they have this
song and I'm totally blown away,'' she recalls. ``I was totally
flattered Max Martin would allow me to sing that song.''
 &HT;    The song certainly kicked doors open for Spears, though it
raised a number of other issues as well. The lyrics of her songs
are mildly suggestive at most, but her videos and photo sessions
have made her as much a teen-dream pinup as any of her male
counterparts.
 &HT;    A brazen, cheesecake spread for a recent Rolling Stone story
drew controversy over its use of schoolgirl props to accompany
highly seductive poses, and a recent television appearance on a
Nickelodeon awards show drew criticism _ and at least one sponsor
withdrawal _ over Spears' performance, clearly without a bra.
 &HT;    The combination of overt sexuality and preteen ambiance has
troubled many observers, but Spears says she's comfortable with her
role as a sex symbol.
 &HT;    ``The first time I saw that there were even guys that were
interested was when I went down to MTV to do the request thing, and
there were so many guys down there,'' says Spears, who's currently
without a boyfriend. ``I'd never seen that, because I'm so used to
opening for 'N Sync and seeing all these girls.
 &HT;    ``And all of a sudden I went to MTV and there were all these
guys and it hit me, `Oh my goodness!'
 &HT;    ``It's cute and flattering,'' she says, ``because they have
their little shirts, all saying `Can you go to the prom with me?'
It's really cute ... But I think after a while it'll probably be
annoying.''
 &HT;    Even now, Spears adds, it's caused her to become a bit more wary
about who she hangs out with, though she spends most of her time
with people who were friends before she became a pop sensation.
 &HT;    ``When I come home I see my main friends,'' she says, ``but I
really don't tell anybody I'm coming home, because if I did I'd
have to go visit 9 million people. So I just kind of sneak home and
totally relax.
 &HT;    ``My sister's little friends, when they're over here, it's like
really weird,'' the singer adds, ``because they'll see me and come
and give me a really big hug, and they're, like, staring at you.
It's kind of funny.''
 &HT;    This summer will bring Spears' closest encounter with her fans
to date, as she mounts her first tour as a headliner _ a
song-and-dance extravaganza with a full band, rather than the taped
backup she performed to when she toured with 'N Sync.
 &HT;    With tickets selling out nationwide _ thanks in part to
producers' decision to book smaller theaters rather than arenas _
the tour shows all the signs of being yet another high point in
what has so far been a remarkably easy climb to the top.
 &HT;    ``I guess it has been, yeah,'' Spears acknowledges. ``The worst
thing about the business, I think, is just the traveling and being
overseas and being so far away from home. But other than that, I
haven't really experienced anything really bad.''

 (Includes a color slide of Jennifer Lopez from her album, ``On the
6.'') 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Let's assume that Jennifer Lopez can sing. It isn't enough that
she's a gorgeous movie star, famous and rich beyond most people's
wildest dreams _ the highest-paid Latina in Hollywood _ so let's
assume that she can sing, too.
 &HT;    What would she sing?
 &HT;    Well, to judge by her just-released debut album, ``On the 6,''
she'd sing an exhilarating mix of rhythm-and-blues songs plus dance
grooves. She'd even co-write three of the cuts.
 &HT;    That's right _ let's assume that Jennifer Lopez can write songs.
 &HT;    ``The music is a little like me,'' the actress-turned-singer
says. ``It's street, but there is also a soft side.''
 &HT;    The dominant voice on the album is that of a young woman fired
by determination to get everything life has to offer.
 &HT;    ``If I had to describe myself in one word, it would be `strong'
_ I've always wanted to sing and I always go after what I want,''
says the 29-year-old star of the films ``Selena'' (1997) and ``Out
of Sight'' (1998).
 &HT;    The Bronx-born Lopez says that ``On the 6'' is intensely
personal, right down to its title.
 &HT;    ``The 6 is a train I used to take from the Bronx into Manhattan
for music and dance lessons,'' she says. ``It's my journey. But
what I love about the title is that the 6 is also a way to get back
home.''
 &HT;    The release of her first album comes as no surprise to her fans.
Lopez fell in love with singing after playing the title role in the
movie ``Selena'' _ though she was allowed only to lip-sync to the
slain superstar's own recordings.
 &HT;    But Lopez was serious enough about singing to invest her own
money to cut a demo record in Spanish and submit it to Sony's
specialty Work label. They loved it, but had a suggestion. Why not
sing the songs in English, to add crossover appeal?
 &HT;    Lopez didn't mind, though the Spanish market alone can be enough
to launch a hit CD. By 2009 Latinos will be the largest minority
group in the United States. American sales of Latin music neared
$600 million in 1998, and are 46 percent higher this year.
 &HT;    But the novice singer relished the chance to reach non-Hispanic
audiences, which she says are increasingly open to Latin music.
 &HT;    ``I think people are really getting into this music because the
passion of it is undeniable,'' Lopez says. ``I want to introduce
people to music with a Latin flavor. I'll throw in a line where you
can learn about my people. I want to throw in a little Spanish
guitar and bongo.''
 &HT;    Singing connects her with something inside herself, Lopez adds.
 &HT;    ``My mom used to take me to dance class at age 5,'' she recalls,
``but I was much more interested in the singing. I studied acting,
but deep in my heart I always wanted to sing. It is my first love _
I think with music you can truly offer something beautiful.''
 &HT;    Of course, she isn't quitting her day job as a movie star. In
films such as ``Money Train'' (1995), ``Anaconda'' (1997), ``Blood
and Wine'' (1997) and ``U-Turn'' (1997), Lopez has captivated
moviegoers with her in-your-face, fiery charm.
 &HT;    In the process, she's brought a welcome Latina presence to a
film industry which for most of its history has been a whites-only
preserve. Growing up in the Bronx, daughter of a kindergarten
teacher and a computer specialist, Lopez's favorite film featured a
Latina character played by the very Caucasian Natalie Wood.
 &HT;    ``I sat through `West Side Story' about 37 times,'' she says,
``because it was the only movie about my people.''
 &HT;    Lopez saw herself in the classic 1961 film, but not in its
heroine. She preferred the peppery character played by Rita Moreno.
 &HT;    ``I never wanted to be that wimpy Maria, who sits around pining
for her guy,'' she recalls. ``Who needs it? I wanted to be Anita,
who danced her way to the top.''
 &HT;    Dancing worked for Lopez, who was only 21 when she was hired as
a Fly Girl on television's ``In Living Color.'' Her big-screen
debut came in Gregory Nava's ``My Family'' (1995), when she was 25.
 &HT;    ``I've always wanted to do things fast,'' Lopez says. ``It's
like I have a fire in me.''
 &HT;    Only two years later, her role as the slain Tejano star Selena
put her on the map.
 &HT;    ``Ever since playing her, I've had people come up and say, `Look
what you've done for our people _ you've given us a part of our
hero back,''' Lopez says. ``That has been extremely rewarding.''
 &HT;    Last summer she scored in a sexy turn opposite George Clooney in
``Out of Sight.'' She still gets asked about the extended scene in
which she and the ``E.R.'' star got up close and personal in a car
trunk _ and talked about old movies, not only in the film but in
real life.
 &HT;    ``The trunk was pretty cramped and uncomfortable,'' she recalls.
``We would lie there in the dark and talk about movies between
takes. Part of you couldn't wait for it to be over.''
 &HT;    Lopez may make movies and CDs, but much of the press seems most
interested in her love life, particularly following the end of her
brief marriage to waiter-turned-club-manager Ojani Noa. A
persistent rumor has linked her with rapper Sean ``Puff Daddy''
Combs.
 &HT;    ``We're just friends,'' Lopez says with a sigh. ``The gossip is
horrible, but I don't want to defend myself.''
 &HT;    In a way, she says, her marriage, which took place just before
the success of ``Selena,'' protected her from the full impact of
stardom.
 &HT;    ``Now it's weird,'' she says. ``I'm single. So if I show up in a
club and I'm there with Oscar de la Hoya or Puff Daddy, it's news _
I read that I'm dating these men. Meanwhile, I'm wondering, `Can't
I just talk to people anymore without it being a big thing?'''
 &HT;    The flip side of her fame is that, especially since winning
critical acclaim in a non-ethnic role in ``Out of Sight,'' Lopez is
finding her way out of the typecasting that threatens most minority
performers.
 &HT;    ``Now I get roles that just say `the woman' and not `the
Hispanic woman,''' she says. ``I love movies where race doesn't
come up even once _ I can do a role and people won't even think
about it. And that's the way it should be.''
 &HT;    Otherwise, she says, the perks of stardom are overrated.
 &HT;    ``You know, I don't have any habits,'' she says. ``I don't
smoke, I don't drink, I don't do cars or houses.''
 &HT;    Well, maybe she has one habit, she admits, raising a stylish
foot onto a nearby chair. When it comes to buying shoes, she could
give Imelda Marcos a few pointers. And making movie-star money does
come in handy that way.
 &HT;    ``The day you buy your first pair of $500 Dolce &AMP; Gabbana shoes,
you're like, `Ohhhh, I'm in heaven,''' Lopez purrs. ``I don't even
wear some of these shoes _ I save them. I just look at them.''

 SARAH McLACHLAN: LILITH'S LEAD LADY IS MOMMY-MINDED

 By ANDREW RYAN  
 c.1999 TV Guide Canada  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Talking about Sarah McLachlan these days, the phrase that people
keep coming back to is ``one-woman industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider her workload: Most people would be content with her
upcoming special for Canadian television and her new live album,
``The Mirror Ball,'' to be released June 15. But McLachlan also
recently co-authored the cookbook ``Plenty,'' and is currently
preparing for her third tour with Lilith Fair, the annual summer
music festival she created and still runs. Lilith is set for more
than 40 North American dates, starting in July and ending in time
for her to catch her breath before a mini-Lilith tour of Australia
in December.
</P>
<P>
   And, oh yes, on top of all that Sarah McLachlan is trying to
have a baby.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a wee bit crazy,'' she admits with a laugh. ``I seem to
like piling the stuff on lately. I guess I've just gotten used to
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be the third and final Lilith,'' she says. ``We had
a three-year plan right from the beginning, just because we knew
how much work was involved to make it happen. It's incredibly
rewarding, but it's an awful lot of work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides, we're all sort of selfish now,'' McLachlan adds.
``We're all in our 30s, and we want to have kids. So it was Lilith
or kids. You can't do both _ it's too much work.''
</P>
<P>
   The 31-year-old singer is quick to point out, however, that
she's hardly shopping for baby clothes just yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't plan for my life to stop as soon as I get pregnant,''
she says firmly, ``and that's if I get pregnant.''
</P>
<P>
   McLachlan is as refreshingly direct in person as she is in her
music. For example, she says she doesn't spend a lot of time
reading her clippings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once I say things, I don't tend to read much of my own press
or anything,'' she says. ``I already said it, so why would I do
that? I think it's amusing, generally, that people are so
interested in me.''
</P>
<P>
   That same cut-to-the-chase frankness jumps off the screen in
McLachlan's television special, which combines performances of
close to a dozen of her favorite songs _ filmed last year before a
capacity crowd in Portland, Ore. _ with candid backstage footage
and interviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really exciting to film this special,'' she says.
``There were eight cameras whizzing around the whole time. It helps
things when you're being filmed and being immortalized _ you damn
well do a good job. So there's definitely a higher level of
excitement than normal. It raises the stakes.''
</P>
<P>
   McLachlan is coming off what by any standards would have to
count as a bizarre year. For one thing, she found herself in court
being sued over songwriting credits on four songs from her first
album, ``Touch,'' in a case since settled out of court.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was her surreal-if-peripheral involvement in the
recent White House sex scandal, in which Kenneth Starr's report to
Congress revealed that McLachlan's music played a part in the
affair between Bill Clinton and White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
Both the president and the intern identified with McLachlan's
haunting, romantic lyrics, the Starr report said, and the two
discussed them at length.
</P>
<P>
   Even by the standards of rock 'n' roll, that was a strange thing
to have happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all just so funny to me,'' McLachlan says, laughing. ``I
missed a lot of that because I was in England at the time. The
story hit just when I got to London, so people started asking me
about it. But it was all secondhand to me _ I kind of missed that
whole thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The president and his mistress are far from McLachlan's only
fans _ she's had four gold records and a five-year streak of top-40
hits such as ``Sweet Surrender,'' ``I Will Remember You'' and
``Surfacing.'' In her own quiet way, the Canadian-born singer ranks
right up there with Celine, Shania and Alanis among the top female
exports from north of the border.
</P>
<P>
   Proof of McLachlan's mainstream appeal came in May, when her
wrenching love song ``I Will Remember You'' was featured in its
entirety in the season finales of both ``Melrose Place'' and
``Felicity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I always say there's a lot of creative license involved in
these songs,'' McLachlan says, ``but often there's a lot of me in
them as well. People are always asking me what a song is about, and
I'll say to them, `What does it mean to you?' Because that's what's
important.''
</P>
<P>
   McLachlan's own life, which has had its share of troubles, fuels
her music. She grew up in Halifax, Nova Scotia, as a skinny,
introverted girl who studied piano and guitar. An adoptee, she
didn't meet her birth mother until she was 19, around the same time
that she signed her first record contract, with the renegade
Canadian label Nettwerk Records.
</P>
<P>
   The hits started coming fast and furious, and all of a sudden
the young singer was on MTV, magazine covers and ``The Tonight Show
with Jay Leno.'' McLachlan struck a particular chord with Leno _
she'll make her ninth appearance on June 18, singing ``I Will
Remember'' to boost the live CD.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're just so sweet to me,'' McLachlan says of the ``Tonight
Show'' crew. ``They keep asking me back. And it's a great
promotional tool _ you get a huge TV audience, and that's always a
good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Given her wide-eyed beauty and wholesome presence, it's not
surprising that McLachlan has already been approached by Hollywood
types interested in steering her onto the big screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are phoning me up about it these days,'' she
says dubiously. ``I don't know about the acting thing. I'd probably
start laughing. I don't know if I could do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, it's not as if McLachlan were looking for anything more
to pencil into her already crowded schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``October is looking rather free right now,'' she says
hopefully, ``and I'm hoping to keep it that way.''
</P>
<P>
   She and her husband/drummer, Ashwin Sood, recently bought their
dream house in North Vancouver, British Columbia. Until Lilith
kicks into full gear in July, McLachlan says she's happy to simply
hang out there and get to know the area between Lilith planning
sessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday, I hiked in the mountains,'' she says excitedly,
``and there was like 20 feet of snow. Then I drove 15 minutes back
to Vancouver and swam in my pool, because it was sunny and warm.
It's unbelievable to have those two worlds so close together.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a great world in which to raise a child, she thinks, and
with all the complexities involved in her ever-expanding music
empire, McLachlan admits that that's mostly where her thoughts are
these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been thinking about being a mom,'' she says quietly.
``I've thought about that a lot.''

HAIL TO THE CHEF: ISAAC HAYES ON `SOUTH PARK,' `SHAFT,' MUSIC AND
MORE 
</HEADLINE>

entertainment package.)

 (Includes a color slide of actor/singer Isaac Hayes.) 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Call him an entertainer.
 &HT;    ``That pretty much encapsulates the whole thing,'' Isaac Hayes
says. ``I don't say I'm a 
composer/writer/arranger/musician/producer/DJ/voiceover-person/actor
.
 &HT;    ``Just saying I'm an entertainer covers it all,'' he says, ``and
I've been at it for 40 years. I paid my dues and worked hard. I've
had my ups and downs and my setbacks, and I'm still in it.''
 &HT;    Blessed with a voice that's deep, silky and soulful, Hayes has
sold millions of albums, winning two Grammys and an Oscar for ``The
Theme from Shaft'' in 1972. He's also acted in 28 movies, including
``Truck Turner'' (1974) and ``It Could Happen to You'' (1994), and
guest-starred on television shows ranging from ``The A-Team'' to
``The Rockford Files.''
 &HT;    These days, the 56-year-old multiple-threat artist is enjoying
an unlikely surge in popularity with college students and preteens,
thanks to his role as Chef, the libidinous, crooning cook in Comedy
Central's still-hot, still-controversial animated series, ``South
Park.''
 &HT;    The show centers on the rude, potty-mouthed escapades of Kenny,
Cartman, Kyle and Stan, third-grade boys with a fondness for
flatulence, sex, death and anal probes. As Chef, Hayes provides the
show's only modestly cool adult presence.
 &HT;    But the small screen is only the beginning. On June 18, ``South
Park'' creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone _ along with Hayes and
guest voices Eric Idle, George Clooney and Minnie Driver _ reach
for the brass ring with a big-screen enterprise entitled ``South
Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut.''
 &HT;    ``I'd never done animation before,'' Hayes says by cellular
telephone while on the road somewhere in New York. ``I actually
always wanted to do it, and had my sights set on a more Disneylike
type of animation.
 &HT;    ``I never imagined that I'd be doing this cartoon for television
that would become a movie,'' he says. ```South Park' just hit, and
it caught everybody by surprise.
 &HT;    ``Chef is a lovable character,'' he adds. ``He's endearing to a
lot of women and men _ men because he says things they want to say
and women because he's very candid. He'll say, `I'll make sweet
love, right now.'
 &HT;    ``I think of Chef as my alter-ego.''
 &HT;    Hayes chuckles, but ``South Park's'' popularity is no laughing
matter for the many infuriated parents who blame the show for
corrupting America's children. One kid, in a much-reported
incident, even set a fire after watching an episode two years ago.
 &HT;    Hayes, a thrice-divorced father of 11 children and grandfather
of 14, argues that those pointing fingers should actually be
peering long and hard into a mirror.
 &HT;    ```South Park' is an adult cartoon, totally an adult cartoon,''
he says. ``Adults love it, but kids got ahold of it. It's up to the
parents to not allow kids to see it.
 &HT;    ``Parents let kids see it,'' he says. ``I've got parents
bringing kids to me to sign autographs on all sorts of `South Park'
paraphernalia. What do you do? What do you say?
 &HT;    ``Kids are not stupid,'' he adds, warming to his topic.
``They're people. Treat them like little people. They know right
from wrong.''
 &HT;    Hayes is on a roll.
 &HT;    ``When we were kids, we said `s--t' and `f--k' behind the backs
of our parents, our teachers and our preachers,'' he says. ``We did
all of that, and most of us didn't turn out too bad.
 &HT;    ``So kids know. You've got to give them credit.''
 &HT;    Beyond ``South Park,'' Hayes has several other irons in the
fire, including radio, music and movie ventures, as well as a pet
charitable cause.
 &HT;    ``I've got a radio show on KISS in New York that I do five days
a week, and I'm doing some acting,'' he says. ``I'm in `Reindeer
Games' with Ben Affleck, Gary Sinise and Clarence Williams, which
John Frankenheimer directed _ I play a crazy man in a prison.
 &HT;    ``I did a song for the `South Park' soundtrack,'' he continues,
``and I'm working on my own CD, which I hope will be out in 2000.
I'll be doing a few concert appearances during the summer, and I'm
also the international spokesperson for the World Literacy
Crusade'' _ an effort to ease poverty, crime and hopelessness by
increasing literacy in inner cities around the world.
 &HT;    ``I'm busy,'' he sums up. ``I'm working seven days a week,
practically.''
 &HT;    That wasn't always the case, however. Not long ago, Hayes felt
as if the world had passed him by.
 &HT;    ``The lowest point was in the 1980s,'' he says. ``Record
companies turned on classic soul artists and left us hanging out to
dry to go with the hip-hop generation. It turns out the hip-hop
guys were sampling us so much that they had to turn back to us and
give us our props.
 &HT;    ``I didn't mind things being hard in my early days, when I was
starting out,'' he adds. ``Everybody's got to come out of
nonexistence. You've got to take on challenges and make a lot of
sacrifices, but victory is sweet when you come by it that way.
 &HT;    ``It was tougher to deal with being abandoned by the record
companies,'' Hayes admits. ``But things are all right now. They are
all right.''
 &HT;    As the old saying has it, what goes around comes around, so it's
no surprise that a new version of ``Shaft'' is in the works, to
star Samuel L. Jackson under the direction of John Singleton. Hayes
may be involved in the film _ acting, handling the music or doing
both _ but nothing has been decided.
 &HT;    ``John and I have spoken several times, but he plays his cards
close to the chest,'' Hayes says. ``He doesn't make any kind of
commitment. If they use me to do the music, that'll be fine. John
knows where to reach me, but I won't hold my breath.
 &HT;    ``I do like the idea of redoing `Shaft,''' he admits. ``It was
such a huge success, and it initiated a lot of things for a lot of
people in the 1970s. But it's got to have a very powerful script,
because there have been so many great action movies since `Shaft'
came out.''
 &HT;    As the conversation comes to an end, Hayes' thoughts flit back
to Covington, Tenn., the small town in which he was born. To him it
represents both his past and, quite possibly, his future.
 &HT;    ``Every now and again I go back there,'' he says warmly. ``I
look at the land where I was born. There used to be a tin-top house
where I lived. That was my beginnings, and I have fond memories of
those days. They stay with me and they keep my feet on the
ground.''
 &HT;    He pauses in thought.
 &HT;    ``That area is growing fast now,'' Hayes says, ``and I was
thinking of going back there, buying me some property and building
myself a farm or a ranch. I like life in the city, but I'm a
country boy at heart.''

 &HT;    Commentary: A diamond in the rough
 &HT;    By Vicki Marsh Kabat
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ The responsibilities of management are heavy. It's
a reality our youngest son quickly learned after his classmates
voted him to be coach of their softball team for the school's
spring tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Coming home from school that day, his excitement soon gave way
to feverish planning. Hunched over a diagram of a baseball diamond
at the kitchen table, he peppered me with questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where's the shortstop play?'' he asked. Keep in mind, this is
our soccer son. He's played hours of softball in our back yard with
friends and family, but he's never actually stepped onto a Little
League field and he's not exactly well-versed in the intricacies of
the game
</P>
<P>
   . . . like where the shortstop plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Between second and third,'' I told him.
</P>
<P>
   He chose to believe I didn't know what I was talking about.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you sure it's not between first and second?'' he
countered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Positive.''
</P>
<P>
   As the mother of three boys, I learned long ago not to be
offended when they automatically assume that, because I'm ``a
girl,'' I know nothing.
</P>
<P>
   What this son doesn't know is that his father dragged me to
countless baseball games during and after our courtship. I know
where the shortstop plays, son. I also know baseball can be as
exciting as watching worms crawl.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many fielders are there?'' he asked next.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nine,'' I answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh,'' he moaned, ``I have to get 26 players on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Turns out, the school softball tournament has rules all its own.
Everyone in the class plays the whole 25-minute game. You carefully
decide who plays the regular positions, then scatter the other
players around like salt on popcorn. Three pitches per batter,
delivered by one of your own teammates.
</P>
<P>
   The day of the tournament, each class wore different-colored
bandanas to distinguish teams. Hordes of children took to the
numerous makeshift softball fields.
</P>
<P>
   ``How could a ball possibly drop with that many kids in the
field?'' I asked my husband.
</P>
<P>
   It could, and did _ many times. Like any random school class,
there were star athletes and kids who had never picked up a
softball in their lives. I was impressed, watching from the
sidelines, how the kids encouraged the weakest players, shouting
out ``Good swing.'' ``Nice try.'' ``You'll get it next time!''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, it made for mixed results. Our son dealt with the
dilemmas of upper management _ everything from loose bandanas to
jammed thumbs to near-uprisings over who plays where. It didn't
help that his class lost its first three games. A team meeting was
called between games and our son reassigned positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I have to play center field?'' one boy moaned.
</P>
<P>
   I was proud to hear our son counter not with a dictum, but a
question: ``What position would you like to play?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' the other child said. Sizing up the situation
as unwarranted grumbling, his coach said, ``No, I need you in
center field.'' Nice reply.
</P>
<P>
   The class won its next two games, playing wonderfully. The last
game was close, with our team leading until a slugger from the
other team hit the ball a country mile, knocking in three runs to
win.
</P>
<P>
   After a rallying meeting with their teacher, the class dispersed
and our son walked over to us.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do we do now?'' I asked, since we were now eliminated
from the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``We watch,'' he said, handing over to me _ gladly, I think _
his coaching bandana. As he walked off with his classmates, he
turned and asked a final question:
</P>
<P>
   ``When does soccer season start?''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: `Roadshow' and eBay slow cleaning
 &HT;    By Mark Lane
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ ``The Antiques Roadshow'' has seized my
imagination.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, I've never watched the program all the way through.
It's not the sort of show one looks for ahead of time. It's a show
that beckons weary channel surfers after they discover everything
on the other 37 channels is aimed at hipper, younger demographic
segments.
</P>
<P>
   Now in its third season, ``The Antiques Roadshow'' is becoming
something of a public-television cult. Not as much as ``This Old
House,'' but I'll take it over any British sitcom or the guy with
'70s hair who shows you how to paint trees.
</P>
<P>
   It consists of kindly experts appraising stuff regular folks
haul out of their attics, closet boxes and garages. Many of these
things turn out to be amazingly valuable.
</P>
<P>
   Some owners of these newly identified treasures take the news
with a handshake and a grin. Others as though they've won a beauty
pageant. And unlike ``The Jerry Springer Show,'' nobody has tried
to beat up an appraiser yet.
</P>
<P>
   The usual scene is an owner of a mystery object standing
expectantly by an antiques expert who displays the item for the
camera and holds forth on its fascinating and unexpected history.
</P>
<P>
   Expert: ``Yes, this lovely piece of ceramics may have been used
as a decorative tile in the kitchen of your late aunt Deb's
Airstream trailer, but you might be surprised to know it was
originally an ornament in an altar panel of a Renaissance-era
cathedral in northern France. The slogan ``Bless Our Mobile Home''
was added sometime after the 16th century.''
</P>
<P>
   Owner: ``Hoo-boy! And we used to use it for a coaster!''
</P>
<P>
   Expert: ``Yes, well, once you wipe off those coffee-mug rings,
it could be worth $50,000. Unless, of course, you were among the
Nazis who stole it during the occupation. In which case, you will
be arrested, deported and quite likely tried for war crimes. These
Interpol and U.S. Customs Service officers standing behind me will
sort out those kinds of details after a few hours of interrogation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please don't try to run. All the exits have been secured. Now,
let's look at that next piece, shall we?''
</P>
<P>
   Every object tells a story.
</P>
<P>
   The amazing finds of ``Antiques Roadshow'' have their
counterpart on the Web at the on-line auction-house eBay.
</P>
<P>
   There, Monkees lunch boxes and Astro Boy pencil sharpeners are
worth their weight in rubies. Across the globe, eBay aficionados
stare at their screens and chant: ``Why didn't I hold on to that
junk?''
</P>
<P>
   This can turn the suspicion that there is more in one's garage
than meets the eye into an unhealthy obsession.
</P>
<P>
   I look at all the boxes in my garage differently these days.
This slows cleaning considerably. I move box to box contemplating
all the contents.
</P>
<P>
   Item 1 _ ``My Little Pony'' pencil box containing crayon
fragments, short pencils and soft-plastic hair barrettes chewed
into abstract shapes.
</P>
<P>
   Estimated value: $0.
</P>
<P>
   It looks like trash but the pencil box might go for $580 on eBay
($900, if it's the rare ``My Little Pnoy'' misprint.) The pencils
might be identified on the ``Antiques Roadshow'' as rare
first-editions of the Ticonderoga, enhanced No. 2 pencil, circa
1912, worth tens of dollars to collectors. You could add hoops to
the ends of the barrettes and sell them around the middle school as
earrings.
</P>
<P>
   Revised appraisal: $700.
</P>
<P>
   Item 2 _ Box containing a small, rusted fork, plastic dog
figurine and a ceramic coaster bearing an image of Saint Apollonius
the Younger with the slogan ``Bless Our Mobile Home.''
</P>
<P>
   Estimated value: 75 cents, but only if you hold a garage sale.
</P>
<P>
   Wrong again. Fondue sets are back in style and this fork is part
of a particularly popular mid-'70s set. Note the avocado-colored
Bakelite handle. The dog figurine is ``Binky,'' the beloved
sidekick of ``Sherm the Worm,'' a short-lived 1980s cartoon with a
scary, cultlike following on the Internet. Originally given away
with McDonalds' children's meals, they command $100 on eBay. The
ceramic coaster should be discretely disposed of through some
intermediary whose silence can be purchased. Do not expect to
receive its full $50,000 value.
</P>
<P>
   Revised appraisal: $15,108.
</P>
<P>
   Garage cleaning is an adventure now. I'm getting garbage bags, a
broom and an accountant.

 &HT;    Small apples outweigh the Big one
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ So far, no one has asked me to make plans for
a New York Senate bid, but that's OK. In addition to being
politically naive, I'd hate to have to go on national television
and say dumb stuff like first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton said to
CBS's Dan Rather: ``Everything that happens in America happens in
New York.''
</P>
<P>
   We could quibble here and say it all depends on what she means
by ``everything'' but that's another Clinton story.
</P>
<P>
   Although her candidacy is as yet (SET ITAL)officially(END ITAL)
undeclared, even we dummies in the hinterlands know what Mrs.
Clinton is up to. She's courting the local vote.
</P>
<P>
   She's making nice to the folks who live in that place where
``everything'' happens. That'll work _ for now. But what about
later? Like when she finally flings her fedora into a presidential
race (which she's sure to do if for no other reason than to get one
up on Bill)? Then what? Are we yokels supposed to forget that the
candidate once considered us little more than flyspecks on the
window of New York where ``everything'' happens?
</P>
<P>
   Even bumpkins vote and pay taxes, and we're known to have
memories like long-tailed elephants. Truth is, most of us living
out here in Nowheresville like it just fine and it'd be a pretty
tough sell to convince us otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Gibsonburg, the village I call home, has one stoplight, one
grocery store, and 2,500 souls. There's a bakery, a barber shop,
and a beauty parlor. We have pizza, a dime store, a library, an
electrician, and a plumber. I figure if I need more than that, I'm
over-consuming.
</P>
<P>
   On early summer mornings, I take my coffee and newspaper to the
front porch. I can sit in the swing in my nightshirt and watch all
of the world I want to see, pass by. Banger and his wife, Millie,
always wave and tell me I'm working too hard. I ask if they'd like
to help.
</P>
<P>
   We have a few joggers and a lot of walkers, sometimes entire
families, since exercise awareness hit town a few years ago. Most
bicycles have baby ``buddy seats'' on the back and in the evenings
even the tiny fry are out taking the air from Mommy or Daddy's
rumble seat.
</P>
<P>
   Folks in our village do a lot for each other without even
knowing it. For instance, there's a billboard next to the tracks
that the Lions put there to keep us abreast of what's happening
around town. This week's sign reads: ``Operation Sandbox'' and
gives a number to call to have the Jaycees deliver a free load of
sand to your kid's backyard sandbox. My need for clean sand passed
years ago, but it still does me good to read the sign.
</P>
<P>
   If I had a swimming pool I'd call the volunteer fire department,
and they'd send a pumper over to fill it. They suck the water out
of one of the abandoned limestone quarries that ring our town. They
used to be the village's major employers until the absentee owners
felt it wasn't worth spending the million bucks it'd take to meet
clean air standards.
</P>
<P>
   Come the end of June, we'll be having Homecoming week and
there'll be a lot of new faces _ to me anyway. I've only lived here
15 years.
</P>
<P>
   There'll be a long parade on Saturday with tractors and horses
and even some floats. A bunch of folks will gather on my front
porch since I live on the main street, and we'll probably have a
bloody Mary and watch the Shriners wheel around in their little
cars.
</P>
<P>
   We'll have carnival rides, and bed races, cotton candy, and a
beer tent and one night, a group called Forever Plaid is coming to
sing.
</P>
<P>
   Does it get much better than this?
</P>
<P>
   So the way I see it, Mrs. Clinton, you can form your committee,
conduct your polls, and jump into the race with both feet (SET
ITAL)and(END ITAL) James Carville, but don't forget that not a
whole helluva lot would be happening in New York without the rest
of us out here keeping the nation's act together.

 &HT;    Search engine enhanced in OS 8.6
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There's nothing revolutionary about OS 8.6, Apple
Computer's latest update to its operating system.
</P>
<P>
   But this release does mark another in a consistent stream of
updates that have improved the stability and speed of most new
Macs.
</P>
<P>
   OS 8.6 also marks the return of stability to Apple Computer in
general. The company has consistently released these smaller
upgrades to its operating system every six months.
</P>
<P>
   Most of 8.6's improvements are invisible, except in terms of
enhanced performance. For example, the upgrade quickens the time it
takes to start up your Mac and copy files over a network.
</P>
<P>
   Apple Computer also says 8.6 improves the battery life of
PowerBooks by up to 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The most visible improvements are to Apple Computer's new search
engine tool, called Sherlock. It replaces the old Find command and
was introduced with upgrade 8.5.
</P>
<P>
   With Sherlock, you can now search through the content of files
and across the Internet. Both of these features are enhanced with
8.6.
</P>
<P>
   Now Sherlock lets you search the Internet with up to 20 search
engines at the same time. The information gathered is then ranked
in order of relevance.
</P>
<P>
   On your hard disk, Sherlock will now search through PDF and HTML
files.
</P>
<P>
   These are the formats used by Acrobat Reader and the Internet
files, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Other improvements in 8.6 include:
</P>
<P>
   _ The ability to keep and launch Internet addresses on your
desktop screen.
</P>
<P>
   _ Improved online help through a Weblike manual you can access
from the menu bar.
</P>
<P>
   _ Improvements in AppleScript, a programming tool that lets
amateur users automate tasks. AppleScript can now control more
functions and works faster.
</P>
<P>
   Apple Computer's latest operating system upgrade is available
online or via a computer CD. You'll find the online version, which
is free, from Apple Computer's Web site. The address is
www.apple.com.
</P>
<P>
   You can also order the computer CD version of 8.6, which
includes more features, from Apple Computer's Web site. The CD
version costs $19.95.

 &HT;    `You've got mail!' not so bad after all
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I'll probably lose my membership in the hip Internet
writers club for saying this, but I kind of like America Online.
</P>
<P>
   Now, please don't send me any e-mail documenting your horrific
encounters with AOL's billing department or the Terms of Service
police. Don't write to tell me how long it takes you to dial in,
how many times the system has crashed or logged you off while you
were in the middle of something very important, or how overpriced
it is.
</P>
<P>
   I know. I've been there. Believe me, I've been there.
</P>
<P>
   But AOL is such an easy target for ridicule. Members love
complaining about the seemingly relentless busy signals, the
increasingly annoying ``You've Got Mail'' announcement at the start
of each session and, of course, the never-ending stream of teen-age
boys sending racy instant messages to any screen name that looks
remotely female.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a certain portion of the online population that
feels it is too mature, too sophisticated and far too Web-savvy for
anything as pedestrian and as cutesy as America Online. MindSpring,
AT&AMP;T, Earthlink and a dozen other Internet service providers are
hoping and praying that your disgust with AOL will send you flying
into their waiting arms.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, AOL members encounter a number of problems. With about 17
million members and 20 million users, there are going to be days
when dialing into the service is close to impossible. The instant
message service so beloved by teen-agers and public relations
professionals who use it to message their clients during meetings
and interviews can drive you crazy. So can the endless stream of
junk mail offering everything from 6-cents-a-minute phone service
to discount modems.
</P>
<P>
   But turn off the junk mail _ go to keyword ``Mail Controls'' and
choose what can be sent to you and by whom. Ignore IMs from people
you don't know. Set the parental controls to keep your kids away
from things you don't want them to see. Then start poking around
some of the channels, and you'll find this service is packed with
more information than you might think.
</P>
<P>
   One day, Web historians will look back on AOL as one of the
original online communities. The basic infrastructure of the
service offers members the best way on the Web to post messages and
exchange opinions about the events of the day, whether it's the war
in Kosovo or reaction to the new ``Star Wars'' movie.
</P>
<P>
   Some of AOL's chat rooms have a deservedly bad reputation as
sleazy online singles bars, but the message boards, many of which
are moderated by AOL staffers to keep the discussion on track,
often receive thousands of coherent messages per hour when big news
breaks. At last check, the ``Star Wars'' message board had nearly
20,000 member reviews. AOL executives like to call the service
``America's watercooler,'' and for better or worse, it probably is.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if chatting or even reading notes from random strangers
isn't quite what you want in an online service, it still would be
wrong to dismiss AOL out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   For Web users who don't want to fuss with Yahoo! searches or a
bookmarked list of Web sites longer than the average Christmas card
list, AOL is an amazingly handy place. The personal finance channel
will bring you to nearly every type of money management
information, from stock quotes to initial stock offerings, market
news and a selection of four online brokerage firms.
</P>
<P>
   AOL also offers a special channel called ``Influence,'' which
features, among other things, an AOL-friendly version of the
popular online magazine Salon. For purists, there is a link to the
actual Salon Web site.
</P>
<P>
   (Depending on the version of AOL, you'll have either the
Netscape or Internet Explorer browser. Both seem to work fairly
well and are seamlessly integrated into the service.)
</P>
<P>
   AOL also has some very quirky features such as the New York
Observer, which may have a Web site somewhere, but I know I'm too
lazy to look for it. Here I can read the latest dish on the rich
and famous, including the fact that CBS-TV President Mel Karmazin
just bought a condo in New York's Trump Tower for $11.4 million.
You can also read Maureen Dowd's New York Times column and find
tips on redecorating your drab den or whipping up a tasty dinner
with just three ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   AOL's infrastructure may be riddled with problems big and small,
but the service itself is very good at organizing its own content
and integrating the Web's most popular sites in one place. You will
find what you are looking for here.
</P>
<P>
   Its unlimited service is more expensive than the average ISP,
but you do get a high level of organization and hand-holding in
addition to built-in child safety controls. If you don't mind a few
busy signals and take the time to set the mail controls, AOL will
hand the novice Web surfer the Internet on a virtual silver
platter.

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Nine-year-old Moreland Isom _ ``Mo'' to her friends _
has loved being an Atlanta correspondent for Radio Disney this past
year. But she knows it'll soon be time to pass the torch.
</P>
<P>
   Think you have what it takes to slip into Mo's shoes? Drop by
the Radio Disney Kid Correspondent auditions from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.
Aug. 7 at Atlanta's Southlake Mall and be prepared to dazzle the
judges.
</P>
<P>
   Where the winners live
</P>
<P>
   The question: What do South Carolina, Puerto Rico and Michigan
have in common? The answer: Each is home to a winner in the
National Geography Bee. David Beihl, a 13-year-old from South
Carolina, took top honors May 26 in Washington by knowing the
definition of La Nina. Jason Borschow, a 13-year-old from Puerto
Rico, and Tanveer Ali, a 13-year-old from Michigan, came in second
and third respectively.

 &HT;    Disney has Atlanta kids by the ears
 &HT;    By Kelly Milner Halls
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When Radio Disney hit the AM airwaves of Atlanta in
1997, kids breathed a sigh of relief _ they could finally stop
changing the station.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out more than 70 percent of 6- to 12-year-olds in the area
were constantly switching from station to station trying to find
something to entertain them.
</P>
<P>
   Enter the upbeat music, contests and zany but G-rated antics of
the Radio Disney DJs, including Atlanta's favorite after-school
duo, Just Plain Mark and Zippy. AM 590 suddenly got tot-hot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Radio Disney _ we're all ears'' sings out 24 hours a day,
seven days a week, and the tunes take center stage. What kind of
tunes? Happy tunes, of course, by artists like the Spice Girls,
Backstreet Boys, Hanson, Weird Al Yankovic, James Brown and
hundreds of others. Radio Disney floods the kid-centered cosmos
with kicky, danceable tunes. And get this _ strictly nonsexual
tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Censorship, you may ask?
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way,'' says 9-year-old Moreland ``Mo'' Isom, a Radio
Disney kid correspondent in Atlanta. ``But I don't think changing a
few words is a bad thing. I think it makes things better for kids.
Then you don't have to change the channel just to get away from
those songs.''
</P>
<P>
   Exactly, says Kellie Wander, operations director in Atlanta for
Radio Disney. ``Kids need something of their own, `edutainment'
their parents can trust. Radio Disney has tried to provide that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's programming that won't cross the boundaries,'' she says,
``but we have lots of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to radio personalities and contest giveaways, Radio
Disney makes learning fun by featuring ABC News for Kids, Back in
Time With Dusty Pages, and Izatafact, written by the people who

 &HT;    Peace agreement talks stall
 &HT;    By Staff reports
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Peace talks between leaders of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization and Yugoslavia have bogged down.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposed settlement, all Serb troops would pull out of
Kosovo during the next seven days. NATO planes will continue to
bomb the region until the soldiers have left.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and European troops then would occupy the area to maintain
peace. The United Nations is also expected to send troops. Nearly 1
million refugees then would be able to return home. Plus, money
would be lent from all over the world to help rebuild Kosovo after
11 weeks of bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The region of Kosovo wanted to be independent of Yugoslavia.
Yugoslavia is run by Serbs who are Christians. The people of Kosovo
are ethnic Albanians, and they follow the Muslim faith.

   Kids' star orbits the earth
</P>
<P>
   Star bright, star light, the first star I see tonight _ may not
really be a star, but a kid-made satellite from afar.
</P>
<P>
   Starshine, a hollow ball studded with tiny mirrors, was created
by kids in Utah, with help from students around the world. It was
released from the Space Shuttle Discovery on Saturday. It will
orbit 250 miles above the earth and will travel around the planet
every hour and a half. (That's 16 times a day!)
</P>
<P>
   The best time to see the new star is just after the sun has set.
It will be dark on the ground, but the satellite still will be in
the sunlight. The mirrors will reflect the light to earth. For more
information about Starshine and how to track it, visit
spacekids.hq.nasa.gov/starshine.

<P>
   Are you a Southerner?
</P>
<P>
   Are Delaware, Kentucky and Oklahoma part of the South? A new
survey asked residents in states across the country if they lived
in the South. The researchers, at the University of North Carolina,
were surprised by the answers.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-nine percent of those questioned in Kentucky said they
lived in a Southern state, even though most Kentuckians fought for
the North during the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, only 14 percent of Delaware residents said they lived
in South. And in Oklahoma, which wasn't even a state during the
Civil War, 69 percent said they were Southerners.

 &HT;    Speakers weather the outdoors
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Now that we're officially into the summer season,
you may be thinking about spending more of your time hanging around
your yard. As you hang out, you may want to listen to a tune or
two.
</P>
<P>
   It would be a mistake, however, to drag the speakers from the
audio system in the family room out onto the deck. Most speakers
weren't meant to stand up to the rain and extreme temperatures
summer can bring.
</P>
<P>
   You need a good outdoor speaker to provide dependable
performance through the outside activity season.
</P>
<P>
   A Bose company spokesman said the company's 151 Environmental
Speakers have been on the market about five years and have proven
their toughness.
</P>
<P>
   The speakers can stand temperatures up to 158 degrees or down to
13 below zero. The Bose spokesman said temperatures lower than that
can damage the speakers, so you should bring them inside before
hard winter hits.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker driver cone, grille, terminal posts and other
hardware on the Bose 151 Environmental are all stainless steel to
prevent deterioration from high humidity and even from saltwater.
The speakers exceed marine industry tests for resistance to salt
fog by 66 percent, Bose says.
</P>
<P>
   Each speaker weighs four pounds and can be wall mounted or
hidden in the landscaping around yards, hot tubs, decks and pools.
They use 4.5-inch Bose full-range drivers and are compatible for
receivers and amplifiers rated 10 to 80 watts per channel.
</P>
<P>
   The speakers sell for about $279 a pair from most retailers
carrying Bose products.

 &HT;    Recordable media is a real disc-o inferno
 &HT;    By Alexis Larsen
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Few innovations have had as much impact in the
field of personal technology as the introduction of the compact
disc in the 1980s. From its humble beginnings, the CD has managed
to establish a dedicated following willing to abandon their beloved
vinyl records for dependable digital discs.
</P>
<P>
   CD-ROMs transformed our computers from a dull, word-based medium
to an animated multimedia experience of sounds and pictures, and
now the digital video disc (DVD), which is like a video CD, is on
its way to revolutionizing home theater.
</P>
<P>
   But the CD has not stopped there. In the quest to enrich our
computer experience with audio and video _ coupled with the need
for more storage space, computers have evolved into a kind of
refuge for new compact disc recording technologies because of their
immense storage capacities. Although neither the CD or DVD format
began with computers, their recordable versions, the newest
revolution in CD media, have quickly gained popularity with
computer enthusiasts and are now on the cusp of becoming mainstream
technologies.
</P>
<P>
   These recordable technologies will allow ordinary users to
create permanent or semi-permanent archives of audio files and in
some cases data and video files.
</P>
<P>
   Many believe the only thing that can slow the compact disc's
whirring success is the incredibly rapid growth of the technology
and the ever-expanding number of formats and acronyms each
development brings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technology is advancing at a very rapid rate, but until we
decide what route we're going to use, compatibility problems will
be standard problems,'' cautioned Joe Miller owner of FJM Audio.
</P>
<P>
   As for what recordable technology to invest in, there is an
alphabet soup of possibilities but only four widely accepted
formats that show some promise: minidisc; CD audio recorders; two
flavors of CD-format optical discs _ CD-recordable and
CD-rewritable _ and, in the very distant future, DVD-R.
</P>
<P>
   Each presents different benefits and disadvantages, with the
only real similarity being the laser beam each unit uses to
``burn'' or change the surface structure of the blank disc.
</P>
<P>
   So read on and discover the best way to navigate through the
fragmented market and bring yourself into the digital recording
age.
</P>
<P>
   Minidisc (MD)
</P>
<P>
   Sony and Sharp are hoping recent sales surges in Europe and
Japan can be duplicated in the United States with both companies
spearheading an effort to revive the minidisc format. The MD works
by recording digital music onto tiny discs inside a 2.75-inch
cartridge that resembles a 3.5-inch floppy. The companies have
fashioned sleek players as small as 3 inches wide and a scant 4
ounces in weight.
</P>
<P>
   Although there is relatively little prerecorded music available
in the MD format, it's being touted for its ability to make
recordings from any analog or digital music source, including CD
players, tape decks, even the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   With blank discs selling for a little more than $3 apiece and
units ranging from $300 to $500 in component and portable versions,
minidisc recorders are less costly than CD recorders, but far
pricier than the portable CD players they aim to displace.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest obstacle facing the minidisc is that although it has
become popular abroad, CDs weren't as entrenched there as they are
here and U.S. consumers are not as quick to jump to a new platform.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got people saying, `I'm not replacing my CDs, I just
replaced my albums.' The minidisc is like the Rodney Dangerfield of
the music business: It gets no respect at all,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   _ Verdict: Overall, minidisc is best suited for dubbing
commercial recordings for personal use at home, in portables and
for making casual live recordings. It is least suited to high
quality recording.
</P>
<P>
   CD audio recorders
</P>
<P>
   Manufactured to look and function like any other stereo
component, the CD home-audio recorder could become the most
significant product available to audiophiles since the release of
the first compact disc.
</P>
<P>
   Pioneer and Phillips have released the first wave of CD home
recorders compatible with any stereo system that has digital
outjacks. The recorder, priced about $600, enables the user to copy
audio from CD players, cassette decks, turntables, radio and even
TV (for cable or satellite music channels) quickly and
conveniently. However, the drives are currently only single speed
and the blank discs are expensive at $6 or more each, thanks to a
royalty agreement with the recording industry, which also requires
that a special ``copyright flag'' be embedded on blank discs and
that CD recorders accept only these flagged discs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Verdict: Factors such as the artificially high price of blank
media (virtually identical to the recordable CDs for computers,
which sell for little more than $1 or $2 each because the copyright
agreement doesn't affect them) and other copyright issues, such as
an installed antipiracy system called the Serial Copy Management
System (SCMS) that prevents the user from making a copy of a
digitally recorded copy, may prevent this from being a contender in
home recording.
</P>
<P>
   CD-Recordable (CD-R)
</P>
<P>
   As recently as a few years ago, it would have been inconceivable
for most people to possess the technology necessary to replicate
CDs in-house. These days it seems many professional studios,
software developers and others have the capability to churn out
CDs. Markets that aren't even associated with optical storage such
as hospitals and banks can be found investing in this popular
technology, according to Dave Ulich, president of Information
Systems Inc.
</P>
<P>
   With many computers being ordered in custom configurations with
CD-R/RW drives installed, this format seems poised to become a
mainstream data-storage technology. With low-priced drives and
media, combined with user-friendly software, there has been
increased public demand for these drives.
</P>
<P>
   Nate Seim, production director at Wright State University's
radio station and a student engineer at the Wright State Television
Center, can't remember life without his CD-R. ``Having a CD burner
is the greatest thing in the world. You've got a friend that has a
really good CD ... you just pop it in and get an exact duplicate.
You want a certain PlayStation game ... it's yours. And with the
blank media being as inexpensive as it is, it's a win-win
situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bought my CD-R drive about a year ago so they were still
very expensive and I hoped that I had made a good investment. Today
I can honestly say it is by far the best thing I've ever bought for
my computer.''
</P>
<P>
   CD-R drives cost as little as $300. Just as important, the cost
of blank media has fallen to a dollar or two per disc, depending on
how many you buy at one time.
</P>
<P>
   With a capacity of 650 MB, this makes CD-R easily the cheapest
storage space around, archiving files for a fraction of a penny per
megabyte. And the process of creating your own CD-ROM disc has
become far easier thanks to improved CD recording software.
</P>
<P>
   CD-R and its relative CD-RW are good ways to create permanent or
semi-permanent archives of any type of file _ data, audio or video.
Until recently, removable storage options like Iomega Zip were the
preferred method of storage, but with CD-R and CD-RW technologies
descending from their former stratospheric price levels, they have
become cost-effective for users.
</P>
<P>
   Miller sees CD-R in his future. As owner of FJM Audio, he keeps
himself aware of emerging technologies and understands why CD-R has
gained such immense popularity. ``CD-R media is incredibly
convenient, durable, cost-effective and reliable. I prefer to use
CD media whenever possible.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Verdict: The unique thing about CD-R is its compatibility with
CD media, making it cheap and interchangeable. Fully optical
technology like CDs promise much better longevity than magnetic
media like tape and disks for storing very large memory-intensive
files. The drawbacks are that they are not sold in portable units,
and because the discs are not reusable, they are not
environmentally friendly. Also, the computer involvement makes this
method more complicated than the others.
</P>
<P>
   CD-Rewritable (CD-RW)
</P>
<P>
   CD-RW discs employ a ``phase change'' technology through which
the discs can be used thousands of times for recording. The chief
problem is that most CD players are not sensitive enough to detect
the differences in reflectivity on the disc, with only CD-ROM and
DVD-ROM players able to interface with them.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of CD-RW drives is $200 more than its CD-R cousin, and
blank CD-RW discs cost about $12 apiece. CD-RW drives can be used
to write CD-R discs, but CD-R drives cannot write CD-RW discs. For
CD-RW discs to rerecord, the disc must be reformatted, which can
take as long as 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Verdict: Even CD-RW, an erasable, recordable CD format, is not
likely to supplant CD-R because of the cost of the blank media and
the fact that many CD players will not play back CD-RW media.
</P>
<P>
   Recordable Digital Versatile Disc (DVD-R)
</P>
<P>
   Right on the heels of recordable CDs is the DVD recordable
format, which ups the ante from megabytes to gigabytes, holding up
to eight times as much data as CD-R discs. Although the current
cost of DVD recordable drives is far too expensive for most
consumers, it is expected that the price will fall quickly over the
next couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   Just as much of the attraction of CD-R comes from its inherently
compatible nature, so a primary selling feature of DVD-R will be
its ability to be read by any DVD device. However, given some of
the historical compatibility problems among the first CD-R media,
CD audio recorders and CD-ROM drives manufactured, it is reasonable
to speculate the same issues could also affect early generations of
DVD-R products.
</P>
<P>
   _ Verdict: Given DVD-R's write-once nature, similar uses for
CD-R are expected, including data storage, distribution and
archiving. Unfortunately, developing the critical mass that CD-R
has established lies in the far-off future when hardware prices
fall substantially. For the time being DVD-R will impact a select
group of professionals; our turn will come later.
</P>
<P>
   The future
</P>
<P>
   ``Investing in today's technologies instead of waiting for
future generations of digital recorders makes sense when you
consider that they are available now and at affordable prices,''
said Seim.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear what fate is in store for the CD, DVD, CD-R/RW
or minidisc, but there are some factors to look at when purchasing
to help make a more informed decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Start with the application first: What do you want to do with
your hardware? It's the same way you buy a computer. You buy from
the software back to the hardware by figuring out what you want to
do and what features you need to be able to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, try and settle on a technology that's going to be around
for a while. Invest wisely so you'll have viable equipment a couple
years from now,'' said Bill Sellers, owner of Encore Studios.
</P>
<P>
   Before you buy
</P>
<P>
   When choosing digital recording equipment, remember:
</P>
<P>
   _ A hardware manufacturer may claim a device can do something
that requires software or media that is not supplied with the
product.
</P>
<P>
   _ CD technology is evolving rapidly. What was true yesterday may
be false today and what is scheduled for tomorrow may never happen.
</P>
<P>
   _ The more you understand about a new technology such as
recordable media, the more likely you are to avoid problems.
</P>
<P>
   _ Some problems may arise from hardware, software or procedures,
but most arise from the interaction of components.
</P>
<P>
   _ CD media are very sensitive to light and heat. A disc can be
destroyed if exposed to either of these for too long.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mobile CD players are more fussy about recorded discs than
home audio players or CD-ROMs.
</P>
<P>
   _ When in doubt, read. Sources include these Internet sites:

 &HT;    Rain or shine, sites track weather well
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The weather is a big deal, no matter how you look at
it.
</P>
<P>
   If you travel a lot for business, you need to know if you should
bring a sweater along on your trip to Seattle. On the weekend, you
want to know if you should try for golf on Saturday or wait until
the rain ends and shoot for Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   There's no shortage of weather information. It's still a popular
feature in newspapers, and radio stations seem to give a weather
report every 15 minutes or so. TV is full of the stuff; there's
even an entire cable channel _ the Weather Channel _ devoted to it.
And, if you hang out on the Web, you probably already know there's
no shortage of sites devoted to the weather.
</P>
<P>
   It would be difficult to write about weather reports on the Web
and not start with one of the main sources of weather information _
even for other weather sites _ the National Weather Service. You'll
be able to find a NWS site based in Peachtree City at
www.srh.noaa.gov
</P>
<P>
   /FTPROOT/FFC/HTML/.
</P>
<P>
   If you are looking for flash and fancy graphics, this isn't for
you. This page, however, is filled with information. You can use
various links to read the latest weather watches and warnings; get
a five-day forecast for the Atlanta area or other parts of the
state; get the short-term forecast; find out current conditions; or
take a look at radar images. All those links were working fine a
few days ago, but the link to software for a meteorological
calculator was not working.
</P>
<P>
   For those of you who want a little more flash and splash in a
site, then cable television's Weather Channel at www.weather.com is
definitely the place for you.
</P>
<P>
   You'll be able to get forecasts, weather maps and even watch
video clips. You can also check forecasts for cities around the
globe. The weakness here _ it is a big one and ironic, too,
considering the source _ is the lack of detailed weather
information. For instance, the entire forecast for Atlanta given
one day last week was ``isolated t-storms, hi 83 degrees, lo 66
degrees.''
</P>
<P>
   If you want to see what I mean, then bop over to the next site,
one run by the Weather Underground at
www.wunderground.com/US/GA/Atlanta.html. You'll find more than a
screenful of data such as humidity, dew point, current wind and
almost anything you'd want to know. Then, on top of all that, you
get a much longer and more detailed forecast. Neither the Weather
Channel approach nor this site's way of doing things is ``right,''
but the two approaches are very different and should help you find
a page that suits your taste in weather information.
</P>
<P>
   Cox Interactive Media (which is owned by Cox Enterprises, the
Atlanta-based company that also owns The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) offers weather information at www
</P>
<P>
   .accessatlanta.com/weather/. The amount of information you'll
find here falls somewhere between the sparse text at the Weather
Channel site and the verbose detail at Weather Underground. But one
really good feature of this site, for those of you who do want
detailed weather information, is the ability to click on a link
that will take you to various National Weather Service sites where
you'll get the complete story.

 &HT;    Take me out to the old Internet site
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If you can't make it to that afternoon baseball game
and can't watch on television, the Web may be the next best thing.
</P>
<P>
   Sites like CBS SportsLine let you follow major league games
pitch by pitch, inning by inning, complete with little baserunner
icons that tell you who's actually on first. So if it's OK with
your boss, you can watch at work.
</P>
<P>
   The June issue of Yahoo! Internet Life takes a look at baseball
Web-casts. The article looks at four sites _ www
</P>
<P>
   .sportsline.com, www
</P>
<P>
   .totalbaseball.com, www
</P>
<P>
   .espn.com and sites on America Online that can be accessed by
the keywords ``AL scores'' and ``NL scores.''
</P>
<P>
   Total Baseball Online's site comes with an illustrated strike
zone and play-by-play text description. Big games _ like the
All-Star Game or World Series _ come with photos. A separate chart
notes each grounder, line drive, pop-up and foul ball.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN's site displays its Web broadcast with scores and updates
on note cards. When a hitter comes to the plate, his photo is shown
along with statistics, including batting average and RBI total.
</P>
<P>
   The CBS SportsLine site is ``the most graphically intensive Web
broadcast,'' according to the article. It sets up a virtual stadium
on your screen, complete with organ music and hot dog vendors. The
screen image also has a box that updates scores from other games.
</P>
<P>
   The AOL sites are the simplest. Each features a basic
scoreboard, updated by pitch by pitch. A chat room and forum
combination called the ``grandstand'' gives fans a chance to gripe
or root with like-minded brethren.
</P>
<P>
   The June issue of Yahoo! Internet Life also takes a look at Web
sites devoted to the summer's movies and movie review sites.
</P>
<P>
   A more interesting piece is the one exploring sites focused on
movie rumors, including: www.aint-it-cool-news.com;
www.corona.bc.ca/films; www.darkhorizons.com; www.cinescape.com;
and www.countingdown.com.
</P>
<P>
   Rich's, Macy's join wedding Web site
</P>
<P>
   WeddingChannel.com has added to its wedding-planning resources
on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The site, at www
</P>
<P>
   .weddingchannel.com, has affiliated with Federated Department
stores and is creating an integrated in-store and online bridal
registry. Federated Department Stores chains include Macy's,
Bloomingdale's, Burdines, Rich's and Stern's.
</P>
<P>
   The site's features include a guest management tool that lets
you create a database of guests and vendors as well as track
invitations, RSVPs, gifts and thank-you notes.
</P>
<P>
   Couples can also create a customizable home page that can be
updated for wedding plans and logistics and that can be accessed by
guests via password.
</P>
<P>
   Another site for online auto buying
</P>
<P>
   Another car-buying Web site has joined the fray. Now, www
</P>
<P>
   .carsdirect.com joins Autobytel.com, carpoint.msn.com and
several others hoping to make the Internet the reference resource
for people buying cars.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman Oaks, Calif.-based Carsdirect.com was launched in May.
The site offers car prices and options on more than 2,500 makes and
models.
</P>
<P>
   It also lets you get a loan and buy the car, all online. You can
arrange for delivery at a dealer, at your office or at home.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between Carsdirect.com and other auto-buying Web
sites is that the others refer a customer to a dealer to buy their
car. Carsdirect.com lets you buy the car online.
</P>
<P>
   Carsdirect.com has arrangements with dealers in 10 markets _
Atlanta, Chicago, Denver, Dallas, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, San
Francisco, Seattle and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Plans call for that to expand to 40 by year's end.

 &HT;    Make birthday castles with printing software
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If you are one of those folks who take delight in
making things like greeting cards, signs, banners, bookmarks, menus
and the like, let me introduce you to Corel Print House Magic
Premium.
</P>
<P>
   All six discs of it.
</P>
<P>
   This area of computing has obviously become very popular. There
was a time when Broderbund's Print Shop was about the only game in
town for you folks. Now everybody's got one, but I've never seen
the like of Print House Magic Premium.
</P>
<P>
   It is, I would assume, the PageMaker of small-scale design. In
fact, it is just about as complex as PageMaker.
</P>
<P>
   The package consists of Corel Print House 4, Photo House 3 and a
bunch of plug-ins, and a database for keeping track of events like
birthdays, anniversaries and so forth. The discs are stuffed with
80,000 graphic images, both clip art and photos, more than 300
fonts and, in case you can't think of anything to say on Auntie
Pood's birthday card, more than a thousand phrases.
</P>
<P>
   I was hoping for a nice collection of Middle Eastern curses,
like ``May a trolley car grow in your stomach,'' but nearly all of
them are sweet and sober or rather silly.
</P>
<P>
   Print House lets you manipulate text and images in just about
every way possible. Of course, great power has its price _
complexity. For instance, you can position objects on a page just
by dragging them around, and you can expand or shrink them by
dragging their corner markers. But you can also size and position
them precisely by typing in the measurements.
</P>
<P>
   Toolbars abound. They're all over the place. Fortunately, the
icons are fairly intuitive.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the product of Print House is child-oriented. You can
make party sets _ hats, masks, placemats, bags and so forth _ in a
couple of dozen themes. For instance, let's say your kid wants to
have a party and he decides on a castle theme. The program will
help you make a castle banner, a castle door hanger, a bunch of
castle games, four kinds of crowns (with or without diamonds and
dragons), a dragon mask, a horse and trumpet banner, a king mask, a
knight mask, a princess mask, placemats for everyone but the
scullery maid, and several other odd items.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Print House Magic is likely to be rough going for
kids young enough to want this sort of thing. Even with all the
helper wizards, it's complex.
</P>
<P>
   The most frustrating thing is deciding upon, and then finding,
the art you want to use.
</P>
<P>
   The program comes with an inch-thick book, about 400 pages, less
than 100 of which are the manual. The rest is a catalog of all the
stuff on the disks.
</P>
<P>
   It ranges from the dumbest kind of cartoon clip art to a nice
selection of old master paintings. You want animals? It's got silly
animals, cartoon animals, Audubon-style animals and photographic
animals. Tigers? A couple of dozen photographs, plus all the clip
art.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, I can't find any way to tell which disk contains
which images. This means a lot of popping CD-ROMs in and out of the
drive, aggravating enough for us old folks, torture for a kid.
</P>
<P>
   On the upside, however, Corel Print House Magic Premium sells
for $50 or less, which is only about $12 per word in the title, and
less than $10 a disk.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to complain at that price.

 &HT;    Most computer glitches are hiccups, not heart attacks
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Few of the people I hang out with in what passes for
my personal life are technologists. And since I do this stuff for a
living, most of them have the naive belief that I am a walking
library of hidden computer tips _ things that are too secret and
complex to reveal in my column.
</P>
<P>
   Truth is, I do know some computer secrets, and I truly do
hesitate to reveal them in this column. But that's not because they
are complex. It's because the real secrets of fixing a computer are
so simple, they're disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   But since we know each other pretty well by now, I will invite
you into the hidden world of computer mysteries. These are some of
the methods used by real computer techies when all else fails.
</P>
<P>
   The first secret tip is the most important. It's something I
have learned from my brother the doctor, computer repairmen and
mechanics. If there is a problem, start with the easiest and
least-invasive treatment first. When it comes to computers, many
novices cause enormous problems trying to fix a temporary glitch.
At the first sign of trouble, they are tempted to reformat the
disk, reinstall all their programs and jerk cards out of the
machine with great vigor.
</P>
<P>
   Since so many problems are mere computer hiccups, try simply
restarting the computer if something doesn't work right. In about
70 percent of the cases, the problem will disappear.
</P>
<P>
   But let's say that you've tried that and the problem remains.
Now's the time to think instead of act. Try to recall the last
major change you made to the computer _ whether it was adding new
software or a device. If you've recently made a change, try
removing the new device or software and see if that fixes the
problem. Then, reinstall it.
</P>
<P>
   I'll give you a recent ``for instance'' of that. My uncle's
computer refused to correctly identify the modem. Now, my uncle has
a master's degree in electrical engineering. But you don't need an
EE degree to fix a similar problem. He removed the modem and the
modem driver (just open up Windows' Modem folder in the control
panel and follow the directions for removing the driver). Then he
reinstalled the modem, started the computer again and let Windows
recognize the modem and install the driver.
</P>
<P>
   There are times _ and these are the really frustrating glitches
_ when neither of the first two tips will help. That's when you
need to take the next step. It really isn't a very big one.
Reinstall Windows. But don't remove the old copy. Instead, simply
pop the installation CD in the drive and reinstall. (Make sure you
have the Windows Upgrade disc, not one of the discs included with
some computers that restore the computer to its
right-out-of-the-box configuration _ if you do that, you'll lose a
lot of programs and data.) But, if you use the Microsoft Upgrade
disc, everything _ including the icons on your screen _ will stay
just as they were. (A prudent computer user will have a backup copy
of data on a Zip drive or some other backup device, just in case).
</P>
<P>
   What if that doesn't work?
</P>
<P>
   Now we are getting into the really ugly fixes. These involve
working with the System Registry or even reformatting the hard disk
and reinstalling Windows and all your programs. If you know how to
do these things, then you'll know why I warn novice users not to
try this without more knowledge than I can give them in this
column. So if all that sounds mysterious and intimidating to you,
then good _ you're right to feel intimidated.
</P>
<P>
   So if you are a beginner, your final fix is also a simple one.
Take the computer to a repair shop and get help. I promise that,
whatever the cost of the repair, it will be less expensive than
trying to do it yourself.

 &HT;    Recordable media is a real disc-o inferno
 &HT;    By Alexis Larsen
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Few innovations have had as much impact in the
field of personal technology as the introduction of the compact
disc in the 1980s. From its humble beginnings, the CD has managed
to establish a dedicated following willing to abandon their beloved
vinyl records for dependable digital discs.
</P>
<P>
   CD-ROMs transformed our computers from a dull, word-based medium
to an animated multimedia experience of sounds and pictures, and
now the digital video disc (DVD), which is like a video CD, is on
its way to revolutionizing home theater.
</P>
<P>
   But the CD has not stopped there. In the quest to enrich our
computer experience with audio and video _ coupled with the need
for more storage space, computers have evolved into a kind of
refuge for new compact disc recording technologies because of their
immense storage capacities. Although neither the CD or DVD format
began with computers, their recordable versions, the newest
revolution in CD media, have quickly gained popularity with
computer enthusiasts and are now on the cusp of becoming mainstream
technologies.
</P>
<P>
   These recordable technologies will allow ordinary users to
create permanent or semi-permanent archives of audio files and in
some cases data and video files.
</P>
<P>
   Many believe the only thing that can slow the compact disc's
whirring success is the incredibly rapid growth of the technology
and the ever-expanding number of formats and acronyms each
development brings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technology is advancing at a very rapid rate, but until we
decide what route we're going to use, compatibility problems will
be standard problems,'' cautioned Joe Miller owner of FJM Audio.
</P>
<P>
   As for what recordable technology to invest in, there is an
alphabet soup of possibilities but only four widely accepted
formats that show some promise: minidisc; CD audio recorders; two
flavors of CD-format optical discs _ CD-recordable and
CD-rewritable _ and, in the very distant future, DVD-R.
</P>
<P>
   Each presents different benefits and disadvantages, with the
only real similarity being the laser beam each unit uses to
``burn'' or change the surface structure of the blank disc.
</P>
<P>
   So read on and discover the best way to navigate through the
fragmented market and bring yourself into the digital recording
age.
</P>
<P>
   Minidisc (MD)
</P>
<P>
   Sony and Sharp are hoping recent sales surges in Europe and
Japan can be duplicated in the United States with both companies
spearheading an effort to revive the minidisc format. The MD works
by recording digital music onto tiny discs inside a 2.75-inch
cartridge that resembles a 3.5-inch floppy. The companies have
fashioned sleek players as small as 3 inches wide and a scant 4
ounces in weight.
</P>
<P>
   Although there is relatively little prerecorded music available
in the MD format, it's being touted for its ability to make
recordings from any analog or digital music source, including CD
players, tape decks, even the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   With blank discs selling for a little more than $3 apiece and
units ranging from $300 to $500 in component and portable versions,
minidisc recorders are less costly than CD recorders, but far
pricier than the portable CD players they aim to displace.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest obstacle facing the minidisc is that although it has
become popular abroad, CDs weren't as entrenched there as they are
here and U.S. consumers are not as quick to jump to a new platform.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got people saying, `I'm not replacing my CDs, I just
replaced my albums.' The minidisc is like the Rodney Dangerfield of
the music business: It gets no respect at all,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   _ Verdict: Overall, minidisc is best suited for dubbing
commercial recordings for personal use at home, in portables and
for making casual live recordings. It is least suited to high
quality recording.
</P>
<P>
   CD audio recorders
</P>
<P>
   Manufactured to look and function like any other stereo
component, the CD home-audio recorder could become the most
significant product available to audiophiles since the release of
the first compact disc.
</P>
<P>
   Pioneer and Phillips have released the first wave of CD home
recorders compatible with any stereo system that has digital
outjacks. The recorder, priced about $600, enables the user to copy
audio from CD players, cassette decks, turntables, radio and even
TV (for cable or satellite music channels) quickly and
conveniently. However, the drives are currently only single speed
and the blank discs are expensive at $6 or more each, thanks to a
royalty agreement with the recording industry, which also requires
that a special ``copyright flag'' be embedded on blank discs and
that CD recorders accept only these flagged discs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Verdict: Factors such as the artificially high price of blank
media (virtually identical to the recordable CDs for computers,
which sell for little more than $1 or $2 each because the copyright
agreement doesn't affect them) and other copyright issues, such as
an installed antipiracy system called the Serial Copy Management
System (SCMS) that prevents the user from making a copy of a
digitally recorded copy, may prevent this from being a contender in
home recording.
</P>
<P>
   CD-Recordable (CD-R)
</P>
<P>
   As recently as a few years ago, it would have been inconceivable
for most people to possess the technology necessary to replicate
CDs in-house. These days it seems many professional studios,
software developers and others have the capability to churn out
CDs. Markets that aren't even associated with optical storage such
as hospitals and banks can be found investing in this popular
technology, according to Dave Ulich, president of Information
Systems Inc.
</P>
<P>
   With many computers being ordered in custom configurations with
CD-R/RW drives installed, this format seems poised to become a
mainstream data-storage technology. With low-priced drives and
media, combined with user-friendly software, there has been
increased public demand for these drives.
</P>
<P>
   Nate Seim, production director at Wright State University's
radio station and a student engineer at the Wright State Television
Center, can't remember life without his CD-R. ``Having a CD burner
is the greatest thing in the world. You've got a friend that has a
really good CD ... you just pop it in and get an exact duplicate.
You want a certain PlayStation game ... it's yours. And with the
blank media being as inexpensive as it is, it's a win-win
situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bought my CD-R drive about a year ago so they were still
very expensive and I hoped that I had made a good investment. Today
I can honestly say it is by far the best thing I've ever bought for
my computer.''
</P>
<P>
   CD-R drives cost as little as $300. Just as important, the cost
of blank media has fallen to a dollar or two per disc, depending on
how many you buy at one time.
</P>
<P>
   With a capacity of 650 MB, this makes CD-R easily the cheapest
storage space around, archiving files for a fraction of a penny per
megabyte. And the process of creating your own CD-ROM disc has
become far easier thanks to improved CD recording software.
</P>
<P>
   CD-R and its relative CD-RW are good ways to create permanent or
semi-permanent archives of any type of file _ data, audio or video.
Until recently, removable storage options like Iomega Zip were the
preferred method of storage, but with CD-R and CD-RW technologies
descending from their former stratospheric price levels, they have
become cost-effective for users.
</P>
<P>
   Miller sees CD-R in his future. As owner of FJM Audio, he keeps
himself aware of emerging technologies and understands why CD-R has
gained such immense popularity. ``CD-R media is incredibly
convenient, durable, cost-effective and reliable. I prefer to use
CD media whenever possible.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Verdict: The unique thing about CD-R is its compatibility with
CD media, making it cheap and interchangeable. Fully optical
technology like CDs promise much better longevity than magnetic
media like tape and disks for storing very large memory-intensive
files. The drawbacks are that they are not sold in portable units,
and because the discs are not reusable, they are not
environmentally friendly. Also, the computer involvement makes this
method more complicated than the others.
</P>
<P>
   CD-Rewritable (CD-RW)
</P>
<P>
   CD-RW discs employ a ``phase change'' technology through which
the discs can be used thousands of times for recording. The chief
problem is that most CD players are not sensitive enough to detect
the differences in reflectivity on the disc, with only CD-ROM and
DVD-ROM players able to interface with them.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of CD-RW drives is $200 more than its CD-R cousin, and
blank CD-RW discs cost about $12 apiece. CD-RW drives can be used
to write CD-R discs, but CD-R drives cannot write CD-RW discs. For
CD-RW discs to rerecord, the disc must be reformatted, which can
take as long as 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Verdict: Even CD-RW, an erasable, recordable CD format, is not
likely to supplant CD-R because of the cost of the blank media and
the fact that many CD players will not play back CD-RW media.
</P>
<P>
   Recordable Digital Versatile Disc (DVD-R)
</P>
<P>
   Right on the heels of recordable CDs is the DVD recordable
format, which ups the ante from megabytes to gigabytes, holding up
to eight times as much data as CD-R discs. Although the current
cost of DVD recordable drives is far too expensive for most
consumers, it is expected that the price will fall quickly over the
next couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   Just as much of the attraction of CD-R comes from its inherently
compatible nature, so a primary selling feature of DVD-R will be
its ability to be read by any DVD device. However, given some of
the historical compatibility problems among the first CD-R media,
CD audio recorders and CD-ROM drives manufactured, it is reasonable
to speculate the same issues could also affect early generations of
DVD-R products.
</P>
<P>
   _ Verdict: Given DVD-R's write-once nature, similar uses for
CD-R are expected, including data storage, distribution and
archiving. Unfortunately, developing the critical mass that CD-R
has established lies in the far-off future when hardware prices
fall substantially. For the time being DVD-R will impact a select
group of professionals; our turn will come later.
</P>
<P>
   The future
</P>
<P>
   ``Investing in today's technologies instead of waiting for
future generations of digital recorders makes sense when you
consider that they are available now and at affordable prices,''
said Seim.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear what fate is in store for the CD, DVD, CD-R/RW
or minidisc, but there are some factors to look at when purchasing
to help make a more informed decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Start with the application first: What do you want to do with
your hardware? It's the same way you buy a computer. You buy from
the software back to the hardware by figuring out what you want to
do and what features you need to be able to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, try and settle on a technology that's going to be around
for a while. Invest wisely so you'll have viable equipment a couple
years from now,'' said Bill Sellers, owner of Encore Studios.
</P>
<P>
   Before you buy
</P>
<P>
   When choosing digital recording equipment, remember:
</P>
<P>
   _ A hardware manufacturer may claim a device can do something
that requires software or media that is not supplied with the
product.
</P>
<P>
   _ CD technology is evolving rapidly. What was true yesterday may
be false today and what is scheduled for tomorrow may never happen.
</P>
<P>
   _ The more you understand about a new technology such as
recordable media, the more likely you are to avoid problems.
</P>
<P>
   _ Some problems may arise from hardware, software or procedures,
but most arise from the interaction of components.
</P>
<P>
   _ CD media are very sensitive to light and heat. A disc can be
destroyed if exposed to either of these for too long.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mobile CD players are more fussy about recorded discs than
home audio players or CD-ROMs.
</P>
<P>
   _ When in doubt, read. Sources include these Internet sites:

CD. FJM's Web site is: www.erinet.com/fjmaudio/

 &HT;    Rain or shine, sites track weather well
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The weather is a big deal, no matter how you look at
it.
</P>
<P>
   If you travel a lot for business, you need to know if you should
bring a sweater along on your trip to Seattle. On the weekend, you
want to know if you should try for golf on Saturday or wait until
the rain ends and shoot for Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   There's no shortage of weather information. It's still a popular
feature in newspapers, and radio stations seem to give a weather
report every 15 minutes or so. TV is full of the stuff; there's
even an entire cable channel _ the Weather Channel _ devoted to it.
And, if you hang out on the Web, you probably already know there's
no shortage of sites devoted to the weather.
</P>
<P>
   It would be difficult to write about weather reports on the Web
and not start with one of the main sources of weather information _
even for other weather sites _ the National Weather Service. You'll
be able to find a NWS site based in Peachtree City at
www.srh.noaa.gov
</P>
<P>
   /FTPROOT/FFC/HTML/.
</P>
<P>
   If you are looking for flash and fancy graphics, this isn't for
you. This page, however, is filled with information. You can use
various links to read the latest weather watches and warnings; get
a five-day forecast for the Atlanta area or other parts of the
state; get the short-term forecast; find out current conditions; or
take a look at radar images. All those links were working fine a
few days ago, but the link to software for a meteorological
calculator was not working.
</P>
<P>
   For those of you who want a little more flash and splash in a
site, then cable television's Weather Channel at www.weather.com is
definitely the place for you.
</P>
<P>
   You'll be able to get forecasts, weather maps and even watch
video clips. You can also check forecasts for cities around the
globe. The weakness here _ it is a big one and ironic, too,
considering the source _ is the lack of detailed weather
information. For instance, the entire forecast for Atlanta given
one day last week was ``isolated t-storms, hi 83 degrees, lo 66
degrees.''
</P>
<P>
   If you want to see what I mean, then bop over to the next site,
one run by the Weather Underground at
www.wunderground.com/US/GA/Atlanta.html. You'll find more than a
screenful of data such as humidity, dew point, current wind and
almost anything you'd want to know. Then, on top of all that, you
get a much longer and more detailed forecast. Neither the Weather
Channel approach nor this site's way of doing things is ``right,''
but the two approaches are very different and should help you find
a page that suits your taste in weather information.
</P>
<P>
   Cox Interactive Media (which is owned by Cox Enterprises, the
Atlanta-based company that also owns The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) offers weather information at www
</P>
<P>
   .accessatlanta.com/weather/. The amount of information you'll
find here falls somewhere between the sparse text at the Weather
Channel site and the verbose detail at Weather Underground. But one
really good feature of this site, for those of you who do want
detailed weather information, is the ability to click on a link
that will take you to various National Weather Service sites where
you'll get the complete story.

 &HT;    Search engine enhanced in OS 8.6
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There's nothing revolutionary about OS 8.6, Apple
Computer's latest update to its operating system.
</P>
<P>
   But this release does mark another in a consistent stream of
updates that have improved the stability and speed of most new
Macs.
</P>
<P>
   OS 8.6 also marks the return of stability to Apple Computer in
general. The company has consistently released these smaller
upgrades to its operating system every six months.
</P>
<P>
   Most of 8.6's improvements are invisible, except in terms of
enhanced performance. For example, the upgrade quickens the time it
takes to start up your Mac and copy files over a network.
</P>
<P>
   Apple Computer also says 8.6 improves the battery life of
PowerBooks by up to 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The most visible improvements are to Apple Computer's new search
engine tool, called Sherlock. It replaces the old Find command and
was introduced with upgrade 8.5.
</P>
<P>
   With Sherlock, you can now search through the content of files
and across the Internet. Both of these features are enhanced with
8.6.
</P>
<P>
   Now Sherlock lets you search the Internet with up to 20 search
engines at the same time. The information gathered is then ranked
in order of relevance.
</P>
<P>
   On your hard disk, Sherlock will now search through PDF and HTML
files.
</P>
<P>
   These are the formats used by Acrobat Reader and the Internet
files, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Other improvements in 8.6 include:
</P>
<P>
   _ The ability to keep and launch Internet addresses on your
desktop screen.
</P>
<P>
   _ Improved online help through a Weblike manual you can access
from the menu bar.
</P>
<P>
   _ Improvements in AppleScript, a programming tool that lets
amateur users automate tasks. AppleScript can now control more
functions and works faster.
</P>
<P>
   Apple Computer's latest operating system upgrade is available
online or via a computer CD. You'll find the online version, which
is free, from Apple Computer's Web site. The address is
www.apple.com.
</P>
<P>
   You can also order the computer CD version of 8.6, which
includes more features, from Apple Computer's Web site. The CD
version costs $19.95.

 &HT;    `You've got mail!' not so bad after all
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I'll probably lose my membership in the hip Internet
writers club for saying this, but I kind of like America Online.
</P>
<P>
   Now, please don't send me any e-mail documenting your horrific
encounters with AOL's billing department or the Terms of Service
police. Don't write to tell me how long it takes you to dial in,
how many times the system has crashed or logged you off while you
were in the middle of something very important, or how overpriced
it is.
</P>
<P>
   I know. I've been there. Believe me, I've been there.
</P>
<P>
   But AOL is such an easy target for ridicule. Members love
complaining about the seemingly relentless busy signals, the
increasingly annoying ``You've Got Mail'' announcement at the start
of each session and, of course, the never-ending stream of teen-age
boys sending racy instant messages to any screen name that looks
remotely female.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a certain portion of the online population that
feels it is too mature, too sophisticated and far too Web-savvy for
anything as pedestrian and as cutesy as America Online. MindSpring,
AT&AMP;T, Earthlink and a dozen other Internet service providers are
hoping and praying that your disgust with AOL will send you flying
into their waiting arms.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, AOL members encounter a number of problems. With about 17
million members and 20 million users, there are going to be days
when dialing into the service is close to impossible. The instant
message service so beloved by teen-agers and public relations
professionals who use it to message their clients during meetings
and interviews can drive you crazy. So can the endless stream of
junk mail offering everything from 6-cents-a-minute phone service
to discount modems.
</P>
<P>
   But turn off the junk mail _ go to keyword ``Mail Controls'' and
choose what can be sent to you and by whom. Ignore IMs from people
you don't know. Set the parental controls to keep your kids away
from things you don't want them to see. Then start poking around
some of the channels, and you'll find this service is packed with
more information than you might think.
</P>
<P>
   One day, Web historians will look back on AOL as one of the
original online communities. The basic infrastructure of the
service offers members the best way on the Web to post messages and
exchange opinions about the events of the day, whether it's the war
in Kosovo or reaction to the new ``Star Wars'' movie.
</P>
<P>
   Some of AOL's chat rooms have a deservedly bad reputation as
sleazy online singles bars, but the message boards, many of which
are moderated by AOL staffers to keep the discussion on track,
often receive thousands of coherent messages per hour when big news
breaks. At last check, the ``Star Wars'' message board had nearly
20,000 member reviews. AOL executives like to call the service
``America's watercooler,'' and for better or worse, it probably is.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if chatting or even reading notes from random strangers
isn't quite what you want in an online service, it still would be
wrong to dismiss AOL out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   For Web users who don't want to fuss with Yahoo! searches or a
bookmarked list of Web sites longer than the average Christmas card
list, AOL is an amazingly handy place. The personal finance channel
will bring you to nearly every type of money management
information, from stock quotes to initial stock offerings, market
news and a selection of four online brokerage firms.
</P>
<P>
   AOL also offers a special channel called ``Influence,'' which
features, among other things, an AOL-friendly version of the
popular online magazine Salon. For purists, there is a link to the
actual Salon Web site.
</P>
<P>
   (Depending on the version of AOL, you'll have either the
Netscape or Internet Explorer browser. Both seem to work fairly
well and are seamlessly integrated into the service.)
</P>
<P>
   AOL also has some very quirky features such as the New York
Observer, which may have a Web site somewhere, but I know I'm too
lazy to look for it. Here I can read the latest dish on the rich
and famous, including the fact that CBS-TV President Mel Karmazin
just bought a condo in New York's Trump Tower for $11.4 million.
You can also read Maureen Dowd's New York Times column and find
tips on redecorating your drab den or whipping up a tasty dinner
with just three ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   AOL's infrastructure may be riddled with problems big and small,
but the service itself is very good at organizing its own content
and integrating the Web's most popular sites in one place. You will
find what you are looking for here.
</P>
<P>
   Its unlimited service is more expensive than the average ISP,
but you do get a high level of organization and hand-holding in
addition to built-in child safety controls. If you don't mind a few
busy signals and take the time to set the mail controls, AOL will
hand the novice Web surfer the Internet on a virtual silver
platter.

 &HT;    Speakers weather the outdoors
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Now that we're officially into the summer season,
you may be thinking about spending more of your time hanging around
your yard. As you hang out, you may want to listen to a tune or
two.
</P>
<P>
   It would be a mistake, however, to drag the speakers from the
audio system in the family room out onto the deck. Most speakers
weren't meant to stand up to the rain and extreme temperatures
summer can bring.
</P>
<P>
   You need a good outdoor speaker to provide dependable
performance through the outside activity season.
</P>
<P>
   A Bose company spokesman said the company's 151 Environmental
Speakers have been on the market about five years and have proven
their toughness.
</P>
<P>
   The speakers can stand temperatures up to 158 degrees or down to
13 below zero. The Bose spokesman said temperatures lower than that
can damage the speakers, so you should bring them inside before
hard winter hits.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker driver cone, grille, terminal posts and other
hardware on the Bose 151 Environmental are all stainless steel to
prevent deterioration from high humidity and even from saltwater.
The speakers exceed marine industry tests for resistance to salt
fog by 66 percent, Bose says.
</P>
<P>
   Each speaker weighs four pounds and can be wall mounted or
hidden in the landscaping around yards, hot tubs, decks and pools.
They use 4.5-inch Bose full-range drivers and are compatile for
receivers and amplifiers rated 10 to 80 watts per channel.

   In the past year, Apple Computer has introduced a new equipment
standard with its iMac computers. Old peripherals such as mice,
printers and Zip drives don't work with these new computers, and
that has confused a lot of users. Now you can learn all about this
new standard, called USB, and what peripherals will work with it in
the June issue of MacWorld magazine. The magazine lists more than
200 peripherals that check out as USB-compatible.

 &HT;    Take me out to the old Internet site
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If you can't make it to that afternoon baseball game
and can't watch on television, the Web may be the next best thing.
</P>
<P>
   Sites like CBS SportsLine let you follow major league games
pitch by pitch, inning by inning, complete with little baserunner
icons that tell you who's actually on first. So if it's OK with
your boss, you can watch at work.
</P>
<P>
   The June issue of Yahoo! Internet Life takes a look at baseball
Web-casts. The article looks at four sites _ www
</P>
<P>
   .sportsline.com, www
</P>
<P>
   .totalbaseball.com, www
</P>
<P>
   .espn.com and sites on America Online that can be accessed by
the keywords ``AL scores'' and ``NL scores.''
</P>
<P>
   Total Baseball Online's site comes with an illustrated strike
zone and play-by-play text description. Big games _ like the
All-Star Game or World Series _ come with photos. A separate chart
notes each grounder, line drive, pop-up and foul ball.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN's site displays its Web broadcast with scores and updates
on note cards. When a hitter comes to the plate, his photo is shown
along with statistics, including batting average and RBI total.
</P>
<P>
   The CBS SportsLine site is ``the most graphically intensive Web
broadcast,'' according to the article. It sets up a virtual stadium
on your screen, complete with organ music and hot dog vendors. The
screen image also has a box that updates scores from other games.
</P>
<P>
   The AOL sites are the simplest. Each features a basic
scoreboard, updated by pitch by pitch. A chat room and forum
combination called the ``grandstand'' gives fans a chance to gripe
or root with like-minded brethren.
</P>
<P>
   The June issue of Yahoo! Internet Life also takes a look at Web
sites devoted to the summer's movies and movie review sites.
</P>
<P>
   A more interesting piece is the one exploring sites focused on
movie rumors, including: www.aint-it-cool-news.com;
www.corona.bc.ca/films; www.darkhorizons.com; www.cinescape.com;
and www.countingdown.com.
</P>
<P>
   Rich's, Macy's join wedding Web site
</P>
<P>
   WeddingChannel.com has added to its wedding-planning resources
on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The site, at www
</P>
<P>
   .weddingchannel.com, has affiliated with Federated Department
stores and is creating an integrated in-store and online bridal
registry. Federated Department Stores chains include Macy's,
Bloomingdale's, Burdines, Rich's and Stern's.
</P>
<P>
   The site's features include a guest management tool that lets
you create a database of guests and vendors as well as track
invitations, RSVPs, gifts and thank-you notes.
</P>
<P>
   Couples can also create a customizable home page that can be
updated for wedding plans and logistics and that can be accessed by
guests via password.
</P>
<P>
   Another site for online auto buying
</P>
<P>
   Another car-buying Web site has joined the fray. Now, www
</P>
<P>
   .carsdirect.com joins Autobytel.com, carpoint.msn.com and
several others hoping to make the Internet the reference resource
for people buying cars.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman Oaks, Calif.-based Carsdirect.com was launched in May.
The site offers car prices and options on more than 2,500 makes and
models.
</P>
<P>
   It also lets you get a loan and buy the car, all online. You can
arrange for delivery at a dealer, at your office or at home.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between Carsdirect.com and other auto-buying Web
sites is that the others refer a customer to a dealer to buy their
car. Carsdirect.com lets you buy the car online.
</P>
<P>
   Carsdirect.com has arrangements with dealers in 10 markets _
Atlanta, Chicago, Denver, Dallas, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, San
Francisco, Seattle and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Plans call for that to expand to 40 by year's end.

 &HT;    Make birthday castles with printing software
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If you are one of those folks who take delight in
making things like greeting cards, signs, banners, bookmarks, menus
and the like, let me introduce you to Corel Print House Magic
Premium.
</P>
<P>
   All six discs of it.
</P>
<P>
   This area of computing has obviously become very popular. There
was a time when Broderbund's Print Shop was about the only game in
town for you folks. Now everybody's got one, but I've never seen
the like of Print House Magic Premium.
</P>
<P>
   It is, I would assume, the PageMaker of small-scale design. In
fact, it is just about as complex as PageMaker.
</P>
<P>
   The package consists of Corel Print House 4, Photo House 3 and a
bunch of plug-ins, and a database for keeping track of events like
birthdays, anniversaries and so forth. The discs are stuffed with
80,000 graphic images, both clip art and photos, more than 300
fonts and, in case you can't think of anything to say on Auntie
Pood's birthday card, more than a thousand phrases.
</P>
<P>
   I was hoping for a nice collection of Middle Eastern curses,
like ``May a trolley car grow in your stomach,'' but nearly all of
them are sweet and sober or rather silly.
</P>
<P>
   Print House lets you manipulate text and images in just about
every way possible. Of course, great power has its price _
complexity. For instance, you can position objects on a page just
by dragging them around, and you can expand or shrink them by
dragging their corner markers. But you can also size and position
them precisely by typing in the measurements.
</P>
<P>
   Toolbars abound. They're all over the place. Fortunately, the
icons are fairly intuitive.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the product of Print House is child-oriented. You can
make party sets _ hats, masks, placemats, bags and so forth _ in a
couple of dozen themes. For instance, let's say your kid wants to
have a party and he decides on a castle theme. The program will
help you make a castle banner, a castle door hanger, a bunch of
castle games, four kinds of crowns (with or without diamonds and
dragons), a dragon mask, a horse and trumpet banner, a king mask, a
knight mask, a princess mask, placemats for everyone but the
scullery maid, and several other odd items.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Print House Magic is likely to be rough going for
kids young enough to want this sort of thing. Even with all the
helper wizards, it's complex.
</P>
<P>
   The most frustrating thing is deciding upon, and then finding,
the art you want to use.
</P>
<P>
   The program comes with an inch-thick book, about 400 pages, less
than 100 of which are the manual. The rest is a catalog of all the
stuff on the disks.
</P>
<P>
   It ranges from the dumbest kind of cartoon clip art to a nice
selection of old master paintings. You want animals? It's got silly
animals, cartoon animals, Audubon-style animals and photographic
animals. Tigers? A couple of dozen photographs, plus all the clip
art.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, I can't find any way to tell which disk contains
which images. This means a lot of popping CD-ROMs in and out of the
drive, aggravating enough for us old folks, torture for a kid.
</P>
<P>
   On the upside, however, Corel Print House Magic Premium sells
for $50 or less, which is only about $12 per word in the title, and
less than $10 a disk.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to complain at that price.

 &HT;    Most computer glitches are hiccups, not heart attacks
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Few of the people I hang out with in what passes for
my personal life are technologists. And since I do this stuff for a
living, most of them have the naive belief that I am a walking
library of hidden computer tips _ things that are too secret and
complex to reveal in my column.
</P>
<P>
   Truth is, I do know some computer secrets, and I truly do
hesitate to reveal them in this column. But that's not because they
are complex. It's because the real secrets of fixing a computer are
so simple, they're disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   But since we know each other pretty well by now, I will invite
you into the hidden world of computer mysteries. These are some of
the methods used by real computer techies when all else fails.
</P>
<P>
   The first secret tip is the most important. It's something I
have learned from my brother the doctor, computer repairmen and
mechanics. If there is a problem, start with the easiest and
least-invasive treatment first. When it comes to computers, many
novices cause enormous problems trying to fix a temporary glitch.
At the first sign of trouble, they are tempted to reformat the
disk, reinstall all their programs and jerk cards out of the
machine with great vigor.
</P>
<P>
   Since so many problems are mere computer hiccups, try simply
restarting the computer if something doesn't work right. In about
70 percent of the cases, the problem will disappear.
</P>
<P>
   But let's say that you've tried that and the problem remains.
Now's the time to think instead of act. Try to recall the last
major change you made to the computer _ whether it was adding new
software or a device. If you've recently made a change, try
removing the new device or software and see if that fixes the
problem. Then, reinstall it.
</P>
<P>
   I'll give you a recent ``for instance'' of that. My uncle's
computer refused to correctly identify the modem. Now, my uncle has
a master's degree in electrical engineering. But you don't need an
EE degree to fix a similar problem. He removed the modem and the
modem driver (just open up Windows' Modem folder in the control
panel and follow the directions for removing the driver). Then he
reinstalled the modem, started the computer again and let Windows
recognize the modem and install the driver.
</P>
<P>
   There are times _ and these are the really frustrating glitches
_ when neither of the first two tips will help. That's when you
need to take the next step. It really isn't a very big one.
Reinstall Windows. But don't remove the old copy. Instead, simply
pop the installation CD in the drive and reinstall. (Make sure you
have the Windows Upgrade disc, not one of the discs included with
some computers that restore the computer to its
right-out-of-the-box configuration _ if you do that, you'll lose a
lot of programs and data.) But, if you use the Microsoft Upgrade
disc, everything _ including the icons on your screen _ will stay
just as they were. (A prudent computer user will have a backup copy
of data on a Zip drive or some other backup device, just in case).
</P>
<P>
   What if that doesn't work?
</P>
<P>
   Now we are getting into the really ugly fixes. These involve
working with the System Registry or even reformatting the hard disk
and reinstalling Windows and all your programs. If you know how to
do these things, then you'll know why I warn novice users not to
try this without more knowledge than I can give them in this
column. So if all that sounds mysterious and intimidating to you,
then good _ you're right to feel intimidated.
</P>
<P>
   So if you are a beginner, your final fix is also a simple one.
Take the computer to a repair shop and get help. I promise that,
whatever the cost of the repair, it will be less expensive than
trying to do it yourself.

 &HT;    EIZENSTAT DOESN'T FIT THE MOLD OF CAPTIAL MOVERS AND SHAKERS
 &HT;    For release Sunday, June 13.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Shortly after their son and his boss, Jimmy Carter,
lost good jobs in 1980, Leo and Sylvia Eizenstat came up from
Georgia to provide solace and advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``My inclination was to go back to Atlanta,'' recalled Stuart
Eizenstat, who had been President Carter's chief domestic policy
adviser. ``I didn't consider myself any sort of Washington
insider.''
</P>
<P>
   The younger Eizenstat was surprised when his father thought
differently. Nearly two decades later, he still quotes the sage
sentences.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, 'I'd rather have you happy in Washington 500 miles
away than unhappy next door. ... Your real life is public policy
issues and politics. This is the city for it and you ought to stay
here.' ``
</P>
<P>
   Leo Eizenstat knew his son well.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Eizenstat stayed and became _ if he wasn't already _ a
consummate Washington insider. Respected on both sides of the
political aisle, he prospered as a lawyer and lobbyist during the
12 years that Republicans occupied the White House. For the past
six years, he has been one of President Clinton's top
trouble-shooters.
</P>
<P>
   He helped hammer out a global-warming treaty that was acceptable
to delegates from 160 nations but that has yet to be ratified by
the U.S. Senate. He is negotiating a settlement between Holocaust
survivors and Swiss banks on the restitution of Jewish property
stolen by Nazis. Angry Mexicans threw eggs at him on an
international tour to explain U.S. punishment of foreign firms that
invested in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Eizenstat has served as U.S. ambassador to the European Union
and as under secretary of commerce for international trade.
Currently, he is under secretary of state for economic, business
and agricultural affairs. And if confirmed by the Senate, he will
soon become deputy Treasury secretary.
</P>
<P>
   He is also a deeply religious man _ ``entirely comfortable
living the two integral parts that make him whole _ his American
and his Jewish identities,'' said David Harris, executive director
of the American Jewish Committee, which recently gave Eizenstat its
highest honor, the Distinguished Service Award.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Jewish Times said Eizenstat ``may be the Jewish
community's best-ever asset in Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   ``The accident of my being born in Chicago rather than Atlanta
was simply that it was during the war,'' explained Stuart
Eizenstat. The year was 1943. Leo Eizenstat was in the Army. Sylvia
was with her family in Chicago. So Stuart emerged in the Midwest
rather than in the Southern city where his father had been born and
reared and where his grandfather had settled in 1904 after
emigrating from Russia.
</P>
<P>
   At the age of eight months, Stuart moved to Morningside, a leafy
Atlanta neighborhood of shady sidewalks and well-tended yards where
he would spend his childhood. He would walk to Morningside
Elementary School. He belonged to the Devoted Sons of Israel, a
youth group. He spent summer weeks at Camp Blue Star in North
Carolina, sharing outdoor experiences with other Jewish children
from across the South. He was a shy, studious, serious boy.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-Semitism was not uncommon in this era, but Morningside was
a Jewish enclave of sorts. Eizenstat remembers only a couple of
instances of overt discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Once his mother drove her son and a few friends to a lake where
they were greeted by a sign that said ``No Blacks or Jews
Allowed.'' Another time, he was walking home from Hebrew school
when two brothers who lived nearby jumped him, tried to rip his
books apart and beat him up.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta was also a racially segregated city in the 1940s and
'50s when Stuart Eizenstat grew up. A boyhood memory: He had been
at a movie downtown and was taking a bus back to Morningside.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, the buses were segregated. I was at the back part
of the white section. There was an older black lady with satchels
who was standing right next to me. My inclination was to simply get
up and give her the seat. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember sort of struggling with this notion. Would she get
into difficulty? Would it be a problem for me? Would it cause a
disruption? And in the end, I didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   With hindsight, ``it struck me how easily one accepts
established patterns,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, when asked about being honored as an All-City and
honorable mention All-American high school basketball player,
Eizenstat says, ``It should be with an asterisk because it was in
pre-integration days.''
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's designated deputy Treasury secretary
received his early economics lessons from his father and his Uncle
Berry Eizenstat, who were partners in a wholesale shoe business.
</P>
<P>
   ``My uncle was the inside guy. My father was the drummer, the
outside guy,'' recalled Eizenstat. ``His customers were basically
the small-town merchants in the South.''
</P>
<P>
   During his boyhood summers, Stuart unpacked and packed shoes in
this family operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember having a conversation, when I was still a teenager,
with my father, saying 'I would be interested in going into your
business,' `` Eizenstat said. ``He said 'Under no circumstances.'
``
</P>
<P>
   His father, who died in 1986, foresaw a sweeping economic
change. The small town dry goods merchants who were his customers
would be pushed out of business by the national retail chains.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, 'They are selling shoes at retail cheaper than I can
sell them at wholesale. That may be good for the consumer, but it's
bad for the small-town merchant who is the backbone of these
communities,' `` the son recalled. ``That was one early lesson and
that has happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Another lesson came as he was unpacking a carton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said to my uncle, 'These look strange.' He said, 'These are
Asian shoes,' `` Eizenstat said. His uncle explained how the
imported shoes cost less than those made in America and how
troubling that was because of longstanding relationships with
domestic manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very early glimpse of just the beginnings of a
globalized economy,'' Eizenstat said.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   Turning down invitations to play basketball at Oglethorpe
College and the University of Pennsylvania, Eizenstat entered the
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in the fall of 1960.
</P>
<P>
   On a Sunday when his fraternity house kitchen was closed,
Eizenstat and some friends were headed to a Howard Johnson's for
dinner and found their way blocked by a group of protesting black
students from North Carolina A&AMP;T. That sit-in demonstration
awakened ``my civil rights consciousness,'' he said. Soon he was
signing petitions and boycotting restaurants that would not
voluntarily desegregate.
</P>
<P>
   For reasons he still cannot articulate, the shy scholar also
jumped into campus politics. In the summer of 1963, he went to
Washington as a congressional intern. ``I suppose I got what my
wife calls the incurable disease of Potomac Fever that summer,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, however, he had not yet met Fran _ the Brandeis
University graduate whom he would wed. That would come several
years later, when he was at Harvard Law School and she was doing
graduate work at Boston University. They were invited to the
birthday party of a mutual friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we were the only single people there,'' said Eizenstat.
``I must say I didn't quite realize that this was being set up.''
</P>
<P>
   They were newlyweds in a Washington apartment and watching TV
together when Lyndon Baines Johnson made his shocking announcement
that he would not seek re-election in 1968. ``I almost fell off the
bed,'' said Eizenstat. At the time, he was an LBJ speechwriter
``working like a dog'' on a memo pertaining to the re-election
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first call was ... to see if I could stop working on the
memo,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   Henry Bauer, Jr., an Atlanta attorney and a lifelong friend,
talked Eizenstat into meeting Jimmy Carter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw him at the old Hurt Building downtown. He had on khaki
pants and a khaki open shirt. I was immediately taken with him,''
Eizenstat said. ``I saw in him somebody who could build a bridge
between rural and urban Georgia.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter was running for governor, and Eizenstat became his
campaign policy director. After the peanut farmer from Plains won,
though, Eizenstat went into private practice with an Atlanta law
firm rather than join the administration. But when Carter was
appointed chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign
Committee in 1974, the young attorney agreed to help him write a
series of issue papers for their party's candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The issue papers were well received nationally. Eizenstat and
Carter went out to celebrate and talk about the future. It was
Eizenstat who brought up presidential politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had lunch at Underground Atlanta and I said, 'My view is
that it's going to be a particularly weak field in '76. Kennedy
can't run because of Chappaquiddick. Humphrey is too old. He's lost
before. It's just not a strong field. If you ran and did at all
well in any of the Southern primaries, you'd have a good chance of
being vice president on a ticket.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He laughed and said, 'I've already decided I'm going to run.
Why don't you join our team?' ``
</P>
<P>
   A presidential campaign later, Stuart and Fran Eizenstat _ now
with young sons Jay and Brian _ were headed back to Washington _
this time to stay.

   YOSEMITE-CENTENNIAL (Yosemite National Park, Calif.) _ When Camp
Curry opened in this majestic place 100 years ago, you could rent a
tent for $2 a day or $12 a week, get three squares a day and a
clean napkin with every meal. That year, 1899, only 4,500 people
visited Yosemite. This year, more than 4.5 million people will come
and about 333,000 of them will stay at Camp Curry, now called Curry
Village. By LARRY D. HATFIELD.

   YUPPIE-PROTEST (San Francisco) _ A rally ostensibly organized to
protect the civil rights of yuppie newcomers to the Mission
District apparently attracted just about everybody in the

Mission residents gathered to defend themselves against what some
of them called false accusations by spoiled, wealthy newcomers
buying up property in their neighborhood. By KEAY DAVIDSON.

   ASIAN-AMERICANS (San Francisco) _ The fund-raising scandal

leaders. By TYCHE HENDRICKS.

   CALIF-HISPANIC (Sacramento, Calif.) _ Despite being called a

   PORTS-LABOR (San Francisco) _ This year, cargo valued at more
than $300 billion will move in and out of West Coast ports. That is
why labor leaders and economists shudder at the thought of trouble
on the docks. Negotiators in mid-May began work on a new three-year
contract that would replace the agreement expiring July 1 covering
10,000 West Coast longshoremen. By GEORGE RAINE.

fallen behind Silicon Valley. The city of Mountain View, population
54,206, main export software, has an ``Ambience Committee.'' When I
came to the Bay Area 22 years ago, I lived in a kind of tract home

   1. THE NEXT STEP FOR THE WAR-CRIMES TRIBUNAL Peter Maass, author
of ``Love Thy Neighbour : A Story of War,'' which chronicled the
conflict in Bosnia, writes that if the war-crimes tribunal in The
Hague hopes to be seen as an impartial arbiter of justice, it
should match its indictment of Slobodan Milosovic with a move
against President Tudjman of Croatia. New York Times Op-Ed. 800
words.

IS THE PRIORITY JUSTICE OR PEACE? This is a changing era, as a
high-level French official has pointed out. The old rules of
absolute sovereignty, of non-intervention in the way another state
treats its own citizens, are no longer acceptable to the moral
sense of states who consider themselves responsible for the
``international community.'' By Flora Lewis. 800 words.
_______________________________________________________________ 3.
MBEKI MUST ADDRESS SOUTH AFRICA'S VIOLENCE AND CRIME Mark
Mathabane, author of ``Kaffir Boy,'' a memoir about growing up in
South Africa, and the forthcoming ``Ubuntu,'' writes why he has
reason to hope that Thabo Mbeki, Nelson Mandela's successor as
president, will redress the injustices that are partly to blame for
the upward spiral of crime and violence that threatens the future
of South Africa's fragile democracy. New York Times Op-Ed. 800
words.

NEW LOOK AT DIETING : FAT CAN BE A FRIEND For three decades we have
been bombarded with advice to eat less fat, but now a growing
number of nutrition, health and obesity specialists maintain that
in trying to squeeze some of the heart-damaging grease from our
high-fat diets, they have sent people the wrong message. It's not
fat per se that is the problem, experts now say, but the kinds of

   Throughout civilization, emeralds have long been symbols of
immortality, cures for dysentery and preservers of chastity. Why
such reverence? Because emeralds are very rare _ rarer than
diamonds. They are rare, says geologist Alain Cheilletz, because
they are a mixture of elements that don't ordinarily get a chance
to mix: ``They are a mineral that shouldn't exist at all.'' Robert
Kunzig, European Editor at Discover magazine, reports on Earth's

<P>
   As most newlyweds quickly learn, intimate relationships, even
the most blissful, can buzz with tension.
</P>
<P>
   Couples typically find themselves struggling over money,
in-laws, ex-lovers and how much the woman's placenta should grow
when she gets pregnant. The guy wants his woman to have a
fast-growing placenta, while the woman does all she can to keep it
down to a reasonable size.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the fight over the placenta doesn't exactly take
place out in the open. The average man, if asked what he thinks of
his wife's placenta, would probably say he hasn't given it a
thought. Instead the placenta conflict gets played out, unbeknownst
to either person, inside the woman's body.
</P>
<P>
   A strange genetic process called genomic imprinting is
responsible. And its existence is only one small example of how
males and females have conflicting evolutionary goals.
</P>
<P>
   At first it might seem unlikely that men and women do have
conflicting evolutionary goals. Yes, both mom and dad want their
kid to survive. And in monogamous species, when the father can be
pretty sure it really is his kid, he may well cooperate with the
mother.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not quite the way it is in more polygamous animal
species such as orangutans, nor was it that way, say many
evolutionary biologists, among our own ancestors.
</P>
<P>
   Those males want their offspring to survive at any cost _ even
at the cost of the female's health and future fertility with other
males. For example, if the male can figure out a way to make the
female spend most of her food energy making the offspring grow big
and strong, that's OK, even if she starves. That's where the
struggle over the placenta comes in: men and other male mammals
pass on genes to their unborn children that encourage the mother's
placenta to grow big, nourishing the fetus at the mother's expense.
</P>
<P>
   Females want their offspring to survive too, but not at the risk
of their future fertility.
</P>
<P>
   This conflict is played out viciously among fruit flies.
Drosophila mate with multiple partners, and the male semen contains
toxins that kill the sperm of other males.
</P>
<P>
   When a male fly mates with a female who has recently had sex
with someone else, his spermicide goes to work, killing
competitors' sperm. That's a great adaptation, but unfortunately
the stuff is toxic to the female and gradually harms her health.
</P>
<P>
   The same sort of co-evolutionary arms race happens in humans and
other mammals. As a result, we have developed a bizarre set of
genes called imprinted genes, that seem to violate the basic tenets
of genetics.
</P>
<P>
   Think back to Gregor Mendel, high school biology, and dominant
and recessive traits. According to Mendel, it doesn't matter which
parent contributed which genetic message, but imprinted genes
violate his rules. With these genes, only the gene from one parent
has input _ the matching gene from the other parent is silenced,
losing its influence over the trait expressed.
</P>
<P>
   Most experts in this new field believe that there are only a
couple hundred of these genes in humans.
</P>
<P>
   About half the genes in question have something to do with
growth of the placenta, the fetus or the newborn. And the genes
derived from the father favor greater, faster, more expensive
growth, while the maternally derived genes counter that exuberance.
</P>
<P>
   As the evolutionist David Haig of Harvard first suggested in
1989, imprinted genes, including these genes in humans, are a case
of intersexual competition, fruit-fly sperm wars redux.
</P>
<P>
   The first battleground is the placenta with paternally derived
genes pushing it to invade more aggressively while maternally
derived genes try to hold it back.
</P>
<P>
   In rare diseases, maternal or paternal genes related to
placental growth are knocked out of action. Lose the paternal input
and the antigrowth maternal component is left unopposed _ the
placenta never invades the mother's endometrium, so the fetus has
no chance to grow.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, remove the maternal input, leaving those paternal
genes unopposed, and the placenta grows into a stupendously
aggressive cancer called choriocarcinoma.
</P>
<P>
   Once a baby is born, imprinted genes take a particularly
impressive turn. Certain paternally expressed genes help make kids
active nursers. On the surface, this looks like another example of
the usual picture: faster development at the cost of mom's
lactational calories. But now we're talking about imprinted genes
that influence behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery of imprinted genes may pave the way for curing a
number of unpleasant diseases involving tumors, infertility and
fetal overgrowth or underdevelopment. But philosophically, the
findings are disturbing. They appear to have some deflating
implications about human nature. We have more in common with fruit
flies than commonly believed.
</P>
<P>
   But a recent experiment by Rice and evolutionary behaviorist
Brett Holland hints that intersexual competition needn't be
inevitable. With careful manipulation, it can be derailed.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers isolated pairs of mating flies, forcing them to
be monogamous. They then bred the offspring with the offspring of
other such enforced monogamous pairs, continuing to maintain the
monogamy. And after only 40 generations, the monogamous descendants
produced less harmful seminal fluid.
</P>
<P>
   Once competition between males was no longer a selective force,
producing toxic chemicals apparently became a maladaptive waste of
energy. Freed of the cost of intersexual warfare, these monogamous
flies actually outbred the usual competitive flies.
</P>
<P>
   Just imagine carrying out the same experiment in people. Isolate
some humans and force them and their descendants into monogamy for
a millennium, and we would probably begin to disarm our mammalian
weapons of intresexusal warfare, namely imprinted genes.
</P>
<P>
   The story of imprinted genes is a bit more complicated, but once
paternally derived genes began pushing for the-hell-with-the mom
growth, the battle inevitably escalated.
</P>
<P>
   If the tribe next door shows up at the Paleolithic watering hole
with clubs that seem just a wee bit on the big side for the purpose
of bonking prey animals over the head, the home team will naturally
respond by getting even bigger clubs, just in case. And soon we
have a world with choriocarcinoma, toxic fruit-fly semen, and
umpteen times the education budget buying $600 toilet seats for the
military.
</P>
<P>
   As in so many other arenas of conflict, it's easier to ratchet
up than down.

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Before the Spanish conquest of what is now Colombia, people in
the mountains north of Bogota are said to have thrown emeralds into
Lake Guatavita.
</P>
<P>
   Once a year the Indian ruler would cover himself with honey and
gold dust and at daybreak have his men row him out into the lake.
As he plunged into the water, offering the gold to his god, the
crowd on shore would throw in their own offerings. The rich ones
chucked in emeralds.
</P>
<P>
   When the Spaniards finally found the Indian emerald mines after
decades of bloody searching, the Old World went crazy for the New
World's gems.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Egyptians had begun mining emeralds near the Red
Sea as early as 1650 B.C. _ and emeralds had long been symbols of
immortality, cures for dysentery and preservers of chastity _ the
new Colombian gems were the clearest, biggest and greenest anyone
in Europe had ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   Emeralds are valuable because they are rare _ rarer than
diamonds. They are rare, says geologist Alain Cheilletz of the
Center for Petrographic and Geochemical Research in Nancy, France,
because they are a mixture of elements that don't ordinarily get a
chance to mix: ``They are a mineral that shouldn't exist at all.''
</P>
<P>
   An emerald is a type of beryl, a mineral made of beryllium,
aluminum, silicon and oxygen. But whereas ordinary beryls are
colorless, emeralds are green because a few of the aluminum atoms
in their crystal structure have been replaced by atoms of chromium
or vanadium.
</P>
<P>
   Neither of those elements has any reason to meet up with
beryllium; they and it belong to two different chemical families
that drifted apart billions of years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after Earth was born, a lot of silicon and aluminum rose to
the surface, then cooled, forming the first continents. Most of the
iron stayed behind in the mantle or sank into the planet's core.
Other elements chose one of those two fates, too, based on their
weight and size.
</P>
<P>
   Because of this parting of the elements, Earth's surface rocks
are segregated into two realms, like yang and yin: light and dark,
crust and mantle, continent and ocean bottom. Geologists call the
light minerals felsic and the dark ones mafic.
</P>
<P>
   The paradox of the emeralds, as Cheilletz calls it, is that
beryllium belongs to the light, felsic, continental side, whereas
chromium and vanadium are from the dark, mafic, oceanic side.
Emeralds, in other words, are yin and yang in a single crystal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole problem in our research,'' Cheilletz says, ``was to
figure out the geologic conditions that could permit these two
elements to meet at the same time and place.''
</P>
<P>
   The answer, they discovered, has to do with plate tectonics, the
ceaseless shifting of Earth's crust that smashes continents
together to build mountains. To make an emerald, those elements
have to come together in a single hot liquid. The most common place
for it to happen is underneath a young mountain range.
</P>
<P>
   Where the edges of two colliding plates stack up, continental
rocks can get dunked so deep into Earth that they melt again,
liberating a great balloon of magma that rises back through the
crust.
</P>
<P>
   At a depth of around six miles, the magma stops, and begins to
cool and solidify as granite. From the top of this cooling mass,
streams of superhot, mineral-laden water _ granite juice _ migrate
upward into fissures in the surrounding rock and begin to leach out
elements.
</P>
<P>
   ``If by chance the granite happens to hit a zone of mafic rock
incorporated in the continental crust, then the chemistry will be
completely different,'' Cheilletz says. ``It will include iron,
magnesium and calcium _ and traces of chromium and vanadium.''
</P>
<P>
   When the felsic-mafic mixture finally freezes, the fissure will
be filled with biotite, a kind of mica. But scattered through the
mica, like green snowflakes, may be emeralds.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the world's known emerald deposits, from the
3-billion-year-old ones in South Africa to the 9-million-year-old
ones in Pakistan, were formed by granite intrusions.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, Cheilletz and his colleague Gaston Giuliani went
to Colombia to have a look at the most renowned emerald mines _ and
soon saw they didn't fit the standard picture.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of granites intruding from below, in Colombia there are
black shales laid down from above _ sedimentary rocks deposited on
the floor of a shallow inland sea during the Cretaceous Period, 100
million years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The sea must have been shallow, because the shales are
sandwiched among layers of salt, which precipitated out of the
water at times when it had all but evaporated. The Colombian shales
contain, in dispersed form, all the ingredients of emeralds.
</P>
<P>
   According to Giuliani and Cheilletz, those ingredients came
together on two distinct occasions, 65 million and 38 million years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Surges in plate motions _ the Atlantic Ocean was getting wider,
pushing South America against the Pacific and raising the Andes _
caused the thick stack of sediments under the shallow sea to
buckle.
</P>
<P>
   Large sloping faults formed several miles down in the sediments,
and hot water was squeezed out of them. Rising through layers of
salt, the 570-degree water became extremely corrosive. Continuing
through layers of shale, it dissolved out the emerald ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   Finally it pooled under a layer of especially impermeable shale
until the pressure became great enough to shatter that layer
explosively.
</P>
<P>
   Then the hot solution shot up through empty cracks in the rock.
As its temperature and pressure plummeted, emerald crystals snowed
out of it immediately. It all happened so fast, says Giuliani, that
the emeralds had no time to grow around grains in the surrounding
shale. They grew unconstrained and pure, without the minerals that
often cloud emeralds found in other parts of the world. That is why
Europeans were so enraptured with the Colombian stones when they
first laid eyes on them in the 16th century.

<P>
   Before the Spanish conquest of what is now Colombia, people in
the mountains north of Bogota are said to have thrown emeralds into
Lake Guatavita.
</P>
<P>
   Once a year the Indian ruler would cover himself with honey and
gold dust and at daybreak have his men row him out into the lake.
As he plunged into the water, offering the gold to his god, the
crowd on shore would throw in their own offerings. The rich ones
chucked in emeralds.
</P>
<P>
   When the Spaniards finally found the Indian emerald mines after
decades of bloody searching, the Old World went crazy for the New
World's gems.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Egyptians had begun mining emeralds near the Red
Sea as early as 1650 B.C. _ and emeralds had long been symbols of
immortality, cures for dysentery and preservers of chastity _ the
new Colombian gems were the clearest, biggest and greenest anyone
in Europe had ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   Emeralds are valuable because they are rare _ rarer than
diamonds. They are rare, says geologist Alain Cheilletz of the
Center for Petrographic and Geochemical Research in Nancy, France,
because they are a mixture of elements that don't ordinarily get a
chance to mix: ``They are a mineral that shouldn't exist at all.''
</P>
<P>
   An emerald is a type of beryl, a mineral made of beryllium,
aluminum, silicon and oxygen. But whereas ordinary beryls are
colorless, emeralds are green because a few of the aluminum atoms
in their crystal structure have been replaced by atoms of chromium
or vanadium.
</P>
<P>
   Neither of those elements has any reason to meet up with
beryllium; they and it belong to two different chemical families
that drifted apart billions of years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after Earth was born, a lot of silicon and aluminum rose to
the surface, then cooled, forming the first continents. Most of the
iron stayed behind in the mantle or sank into the planet's core.
Other elements chose one of those two fates, too, based on their
weight and size.
</P>
<P>
   Because of this parting of the elements, Earth's surface rocks
are segregated into two realms, like yang and yin: light and dark,
crust and mantle, continent and ocean bottom. Geologists call the
light minerals felsic and the dark ones mafic.
</P>
<P>
   The paradox of the emeralds, as Cheilletz calls it, is that
beryllium belongs to the light, felsic, continental side, whereas
chromium and vanadium are from the dark, mafic, oceanic side.
Emeralds, in other words, are yin and yang in a single crystal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole problem in our research,'' Cheilletz says, ``was to
figure out the geologic conditions that could permit these two
elements to meet at the same time and place.''
</P>
<P>
   The answer, they discovered, has to do with plate tectonics, the
ceaseless shifting of Earth's crust that smashes continents
together to build mountains. To make an emerald, those elements
have to come together in a single hot liquid. The most common place
for it to happen is underneath a young mountain range.
</P>
<P>
   Where the edges of two colliding plates stack up, continental
rocks can get dunked so deep into Earth that they melt again,
liberating a great balloon of magma that rises back through the
crust.
</P>
<P>
   At a depth of around six miles, the magma stops, and begins to
cool and solidify as granite. From the top of this cooling mass,
streams of superhot, mineral-laden water _ granite juice _ migrate

incorporated in the continental crust, then the chemistry will be
completely different,'' Cheilletz says. ``It will include iron,
magnesium and calcium _ and traces of chromium and vanadium.''
</P>

<P>
   As most newlyweds quickly learn, intimate relationships, even
the most blissful, can buzz with tension.
</P>
<P>
   Couples typically find themselves struggling over money,
in-laws, ex-lovers and how much the woman's placenta should grow
when she gets pregnant. The guy wants his woman to have a
fast-growing placenta, while the woman does all she can to keep it
down to a reasonable size.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the fight over the placenta doesn't exactly take
place out in the open. The average man, if asked what he thinks of
his wife's placenta, would probably say he hasn't given it a
thought. Instead the placenta conflict gets played out, unbeknownst
to either person, inside the woman's body.
</P>
<P>
   A strange genetic process called genomic imprinting is
responsible. And its existence is only one small example of how
males and females have conflicting evolutionary goals.
</P>
<P>
   At first it might seem unlikely that men and women do have
conflicting evolutionary goals. Yes, both mom and dad want their
kid to survive. And in monogamous species, when the father can be
pretty sure it really is his kid, he may well cooperate with the
mother.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not quite the way it is in more polygamous animal
species such as orangutans, nor was it that way, say many
evolutionary biologists, among our own ancestors.
</P>
<P>
   Those males want their offspring to survive at any cost _ even
at the cost of the female's health and future fertility with other
males. For example, if the male can figure out a way to make the
female spend most of her food energy making the offspring grow big
and strong, that's OK, even if she starves. That's where the
struggle over the placenta comes in: men and other male mammals
pass on genes to their unborn children that encourage the mother's
placenta to grow big, nourishing the fetus at the mother's expense.
</P>
<P>
   Females want their offspring to survive too, but not at the risk
of their future fertility.
</P>
<P>
   This conflict is played out viciously among fruit flies.
Drosophila mate with multiple partners, and the male semen contains
toxins that kill the sperm of other males.
</P>
<P>
   When a male fly mates with a female who has recently had sex
with someone else, his spermicide goes to work, killing
competitors' sperm. That's a great adaptation, but unfortunately
the stuff is toxic to the female and gradually harms her health.
</P>
<P>
   The same sort of co-evolutionary arms race happens in humans and
other mammals. As a result, we have developed a bizarre set of
genes called imprinted genes, that seem to violate the basic tenets
of genetics.
</P>
<P>
   Think back to Gregor Mendel, high school biology, and dominant
and recessive traits. According to Mendel, it doesn't matter which
parent contributed which genetic message, but imprinted genes
violate his rules. With these genes, only the gene from one parent
has input _ the matching gene from the other parent is silenced,
losing its influence over the trait expressed.
</P>
<P>
   Most experts in this new field believe that there are only a
couple hundred of these genes in humans.
</P>
<P>
   About half the genes in question have something to do with
growth of the placenta, the fetus or the newborn. And the genes
derived from the father favor greater, faster, more expensive
growth, while the maternally derived genes counter that exuberance.
</P>
<P>
   As the evolutionist David Haig of Harvard first suggested in
1989, imprinted genes, including these genes in humans, are a case
of intersexual competition, fruit-fly sperm wars redux.
</P>
<P>
   The first battleground is the placenta with paternally derived
genes pushing it to invade more aggressively while maternally
derived genes try to hold it back.
</P>
<P>
   In rare diseases, maternal or paternal genes related to
placental growth are knocked out of action. Lose the paternal input
and the antigrowth maternal component is left unopposed _ the
placenta never invades the mother's endometrium, so the fetus has
no chance to grow.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, remove the maternal input, leaving those paternal
genes unopposed, and the placenta grows into a stupendously
aggressive cancer called choriocarcinoma.
</P>
<P>
   Once a baby is born, imprinted genes take a particularly
impressive turn. Certain paternally expressed genes help make kids
active nursers. On the surface, this looks like another example of
the usual picture: faster development at the cost of mom's
lactational calories. But now we're talking about imprinted genes
that influence behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery of imprinted genes may pave the way for curing a
number of unpleasant diseases involving tumors, infertility and
fetal overgrowth or underdevelopment. But philosophically, the
findings are disturbing. They appear to have some deflating
implications about human nature. We have more in common with fruit
flies than commonly believed.
</P>
<P>
   But a recent experiment by Rice and evolutionary behaviorist
Brett Holland hints that intersexual competition needn't be
inevitable. With careful manipulation, it can be derailed.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers isolated pairs of mating flies, forcing them to
be monogamous. They then bred the offspring with the offspring of
other such enforced monogamous pairs, continuing to maintain the
monogamy. And after only 40 generations, the monogamous descendants
produced less harmful seminal fluid.
</P>
<P>
   Once competition between males was no longer a selective force,
producing toxic chemicals apparently became a maladaptive waste of
energy. Freed of the cost of intersexual warfare, these monogamous
flies actually outbred the usual competitive flies.
</P>
<P>
   Just imagine carrying out the same experiment in people. Isolate
some humans and force them and their descendants into monogamy for
a millennium, and we would probably begin to disarm our mammalian
weapons of intresexusal warfare, namely imprinted genes.
</P>
<P>
   The story of imprinted genes is a bit more complicated, but once
paternally derived genes began pushing for the-hell-with-the mom
growth, the battle inevitably escalated.
</P>
<P>
   If the tribe next door shows up at the Paleolithic watering hole
with clubs that seem just a wee bit on the big side for the purpose
of bonking prey animals over the head, the home team will naturally
respond by getting even bigger clubs, just in case. And soon we
have a world with choriocarcinoma, toxic fruit-fly semen, and
umpteen times the education budget buying $600 toilet seats for the
military.
</P>
<P>
   As in so many other arenas of conflict, it's easier to ratchet
up than down.

<P>
   Before the Spanish conquest of what is now Colombia, people in
the mountains north of Bogota are said to have thrown emeralds into
Lake Guatavita.
</P>
<P>
   Once a year the Indian ruler would cover himself with honey and
gold dust and at daybreak have his men row him out into the lake.
As he plunged into the water, offering the gold to his god, the
crowd on shore would throw in their own offerings. The rich ones
chucked in emeralds.
</P>
<P>
   When the Spaniards finally found the Indian emerald mines after
decades of bloody searching, the Old World went crazy for the New
World's gems.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Egyptians had begun mining emeralds near the Red
Sea as early as 1650 B.C. _ and emeralds had long been symbols of
immortality, cures for dysentery and preservers of chastity _ the
new Colombian gems were the clearest, biggest and greenest anyone
in Europe had ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   Emeralds are valuable because they are rare _ rarer than
diamonds. They are rare, says geologist Alain Cheilletz of the
Center for Petrographic and Geochemical Research in Nancy, France,
because they are a mixture of elements that don't ordinarily get a
chance to mix: ``They are a mineral that shouldn't exist at all.''
</P>
<P>
   An emerald is a type of beryl, a mineral made of beryllium,
aluminum, silicon and oxygen. But whereas ordinary beryls are
colorless, emeralds are green because a few of the aluminum atoms
in their crystal structure have been replaced by atoms of chromium
or vanadium.
</P>
<P>
   Neither of those elements has any reason to meet up with
beryllium; they and it belong to two different chemical families
that drifted apart billions of years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after Earth was born, a lot of silicon and aluminum rose to
the surface, then cooled, forming the first continents. Most of the
iron stayed behind in the mantle or sank into the planet's core.
Other elements chose one of those two fates, too, based on their
weight and size.
</P>
<P>
   Because of this parting of the elements, Earth's surface rocks
are segregated into two realms, like yang and yin: light and dark,
crust and mantle, continent and ocean bottom. Geologists call the
light minerals felsic and the dark ones mafic.
</P>
<P>
   The paradox of the emeralds, as Cheilletz calls it, is that
beryllium belongs to the light, felsic, continental side, whereas
chromium and vanadium are from the dark, mafic, oceanic side.
Emeralds, in other words, are yin and yang in a single crystal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole problem in our research,'' Cheilletz says, ``was to
figure out the geologic conditions that could permit these two
elements to meet at the same time and place.''
</P>
<P>
   The answer, they discovered, has to do with plate tectonics, the
ceaseless shifting of Earth's crust that smashes continents
together to build mountains. To make an emerald, those elements
have to come together in a single hot liquid. The most common place
for it to happen is underneath a young mountain range.
</P>
<P>
   Where the edges of two colliding plates stack up, continental
rocks can get dunked so deep into Earth that they melt again,
liberating a great balloon of magma that rises back through the
crust.
</P>
<P>
   At a depth of around six miles, the magma stops, and begins to
cool and solidify as granite. From the top of this cooling mass,
streams of superhot, mineral-laden water _ granite juice _ migrate
upward into fissures in the surrounding rock and begin to leach out
elements.
</P>
<P>
   ``If by chance the granite happens to hit a zone of mafic rock
incorporated in the continental crust, then the chemistry will be
completely different,'' Cheilletz says. ``It will include iron,
magnesium and calcium _ and traces of chromium and vanadium.''
</P>
<P>
   When the felsic-mafic mixture finally freezes, the fissure will
be filled with biotite, a kind of mica. But scattered through the
mica, like green snowflakes, may be emeralds.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the world's known emerald deposits, from the
3-billion-year-old ones in South Africa to the 9-million-year-old
ones in Pakistan, were formed by granite intrusions.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, Cheilletz and his colleague Gaston Giuliani went
to Colombia to have a look at the most renowned emerald mines _ and
soon saw they didn't fit the standard picture.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of granites intruding from below, in Colombia there are
black shales laid down from above _ sedimentary rocks deposited on
the floor of a shallow inland sea during the Cretaceous Period, 100
million years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The sea must have been shallow, because the shales are
sandwiched among layers of salt, which precipitated out of the
water at times when it had all but evaporated. The Colombian shales
contain, in dispersed form, all the ingredients of emeralds.
</P>
<P>
   According to Giuliani and Cheilletz, those ingredients came
together on two distinct occasions, 65 million and 38 million years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Surges in plate motions _ the Atlantic Ocean was getting wider,
pushing South America against the Pacific and raising the Andes _
caused the thick stack of sediments under the shallow sea to
buckle.
</P>
<P>
   Large sloping faults formed several miles down in the sediments,
and hot water was squeezed out of them. Rising through layers of
salt, the 570-degree water became extremely corrosive. Continuing
through layers of shale, it dissolved out the emerald ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   Finally it pooled under a layer of especially impermeable shale
until the pressure became great enough to shatter that layer
explosively.
</P>
<P>
   Then the hot solution shot up through empty cracks in the rock.
As its temperature and pressure plummeted, emerald crystals snowed
out of it immediately. It all happened so fast, says Giuliani, that
the emeralds had no time to grow around grains in the surrounding
shale. They grew unconstrained and pure, without the minerals that
often cloud emeralds found in other parts of the world. That is why
Europeans were so enraptured with the Colombian stones when they
first laid eyes on them in the 16th century.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   As most newlyweds quickly learn, intimate relationships, even
the most blissful, can buzz with tension.
</P>
<P>
   Couples typically find themselves struggling over money,
in-laws, ex-lovers and how much the woman's placenta should grow
when she gets pregnant. The guy wants his woman to have a
fast-growing placenta, while the woman does all she can to keep it
down to a reasonable size.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the fight over the placenta doesn't exactly take
place out in the open. The average man, if asked what he thinks of
his wife's placenta, would probably say he hasn't given it a
thought. Instead the placenta conflict gets played out, unbeknownst
to either person, inside the woman's body.
</P>
<P>
   A strange genetic process called genomic imprinting is
responsible. And its existence is only one small example of how
males and females have conflicting evolutionary goals.
</P>
<P>
   At first it might seem unlikely that men and women do have
conflicting evolutionary goals. Yes, both mom and dad want their
kid to survive. And in monogamous species, when the father can be
pretty sure it really is his kid, he may well cooperate with the
mother.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not quite the way it is in more polygamous animal
species such as orangutans, nor was it that way, say many
evolutionary biologists, among our own ancestors.
</P>
<P>
   Those males want their offspring to survive at any cost _ even
at the cost of the female's health and future fertility with other
males. For example, if the male can figure out a way to make the
female spend most of her food energy making the offspring grow big
and strong, that's OK, even if she starves. That's where the
struggle over the placenta comes in: men and other male mammals
pass on genes to their unborn children that encourage the mother's
placenta to grow big, nourishing the fetus at the mother's expense.
</P>
<P>
   Females want their offspring to survive too, but not at the risk
of their future fertility.
</P>
<P>
   This conflict is played out viciously among fruit flies.
Drosophila mate with multiple partners, and the male semen contains
toxins that kill the sperm of other males.
</P>
<P>
   When a male fly mates with a female who has recently had sex
with someone else, his spermicide goes to work, killing
competitors' sperm. That's a great adaptation, but unfortunately
the stuff is toxic to the female and gradually harms her health.
</P>
<P>
   The same sort of co-evolutionary arms race happens in humans and
other mammals. As a result, we have developed a bizarre set of
genes called imprinted genes, that seem to violate the basic tenets
of genetics.
</P>
<P>
   Think back to Gregor Mendel, high school biology, and dominant
and recessive traits. According to Mendel, it doesn't matter which
parent contributed which genetic message, but imprinted genes
violate his rules. With these genes, only the gene from one parent
has input _ the matching gene from the other parent is silenced,
losing its influence over the trait expressed.
</P>
<P>
   Most experts in this new field believe that there are only a
couple hundred of these genes in humans.
</P>
<P>
   About half the genes in question have something to do with
growth of the placenta, the fetus or the newborn. And the genes
derived from the father favor greater, faster, more expensive
growth, while the maternally derived genes counter that exuberance.
</P>
<P>
   As the evolutionist David Haig of Harvard first suggested in
1989, imprinted genes, including these genes in humans, are a case
of intersexual competition, fruit-fly sperm wars redux.
</P>
<P>
   The first battleground is the placenta with paternally derived
genes pushing it to invade more aggressively while maternally
derived genes try to hold it back.
</P>
<P>
   In rare diseases, maternal or paternal genes related to
placental growth are knocked out of action. Lose the paternal input
and the antigrowth maternal component is left unopposed _ the
placenta never invades the mother's endometrium, so the fetus has
no chance to grow.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, remove the maternal input, leaving those paternal
genes unopposed, and the placenta grows into a stupendously
aggressive cancer called choriocarcinoma.
</P>
<P>
   Once a baby is born, imprinted genes take a particularly
impressive turn. Certain paternally expressed genes help make kids
active nursers. On the surface, this looks like another example of
the usual picture: faster development at the cost of mom's
lactational calories. But now we're talking about imprinted genes
that influence behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery of imprinted genes may pave the way for curing a
number of unpleasant diseases involving tumors, infertility and
fetal overgrowth or underdevelopment. But philosophically, the
findings are disturbing. They appear to have some deflating
implications about human nature. We have more in common with fruit
flies than commonly believed.
</P>
<P>
   But a recent experiment by Rice and evolutionary behaviorist
Brett Holland hints that intersexual competition needn't be
inevitable. With careful manipulation, it can be derailed.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers isolated pairs of mating flies, forcing them to
be monogamous. They then bred the offspring with the offspring of
other such enforced monogamous pairs, continuing to maintain the
monogamy. And after only 40 generations, the monogamous descendants
produced less harmful seminal fluid.
</P>
<P>
   Once competition between males was no longer a selective force,
producing toxic chemicals apparently became a maladaptive waste of
energy. Freed of the cost of intersexual warfare, these monogamous
flies actually outbred the usual competitive flies.
</P>
<P>
   Just imagine carrying out the same experiment in people. Isolate
some humans and force them and their descendants into monogamy for
a millennium, and we would probably begin to disarm our mammalian
weapons of intresexusal warfare, namely imprinted genes.
</P>
<P>
   The story of imprinted genes is a bit more complicated, but once
paternally derived genes began pushing for the-hell-with-the mom
growth, the battle inevitably escalated.
</P>
<P>
   If the tribe next door shows up at the Paleolithic watering hole
with clubs that seem just a wee bit on the big side for the purpose
of bonking prey animals over the head, the home team will naturally
respond by getting even bigger clubs, just in case. And soon we
have a world with choriocarcinoma, toxic fruit-fly semen, and
umpteen times the education budget buying $600 toilet seats for the
military.
</P>
<P>
   As in so many other arenas of conflict, it's easier to ratchet
up than down.

competitors' sperm. That's a great adaptation, but unfortunately
the stuff is toxic to the female and gradually harms her health.
</P>
<P>
   The same sort of co-evolutionary arms race happens in humans and
other mammals. As a result, we have developed a bizarre set of
genes called imprinted genes, that seem to violate the basic tenets
of genetics.
</P>
<P>
   Think back to Gregor Mendel, high school biology, and dominant
and recessive traits. According to Mendel, it doesn't matter which
parent contributed which genetic message, but imprinted genes
violate his rules. With these genes, only the gene from one parent
has input _ the matching gene from the other parent is silenced,
losing its influence over the trait expressed.
</P>
<P>
   Most experts in this new field believe that there are only a
couple hundred of these genes in humans.
</P>
<P>
   About half the genes in question have something to do with
growth of the placenta, the fetus or the newborn. And the genes
derived from the father favor greater, faster, more expensive
growth, while the maternally derived genes counter that exuberance.
</P>
<P>
   As the evolutionist David Haig of Harvard first suggested in
1989, imprinted genes, including these genes in humans, are a case
of intersexual competition, fruit-fly sperm wars redux.
</P>
<P>
   The first battleground is the placenta with paternally derived
genes pushing it to invade more aggressively while maternally
derived genes try to hold it back.
</P>
<P>
   In rare diseases, maternal or paternal genes related to
placental growth are knocked out of action. Lose the paternal input
and the antigrowth maternal component is left unopposed _ the
placenta never invades the mother's endometrium, so the fetus has
no chance to grow.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, remove the maternal input, leaving those paternal
genes unopposed, and the placenta grows into a stupendously
aggressive cancer called choriocarcinoma.
</P>
<P>
   Once a baby is born, imprinted genes take a particularly
impressive turn. Certain paternally expressed genes help make kids
active nursers. On the surface, this looks like another example of
the usual picture: faster development at the cost of mom's
lactational calories. But now we're talking about imprinted genes
that influence behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery of imprinted genes may pave the way for curing a
number of unpleasant diseases involving tumors, infertility and
fetal overgrowth or underdevelopment. But philosophically, the
findings are disturbing. They appear to have some deflating
implications about human nature. We have more in common with fruit
flies than commonly believed.
</P>
<P>
   But a recent experiment by Rice and evolutionary behaviorist
Brett Holland hints that intersexual competition needn't be
inevitable. With careful manipulation, it can be derailed.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers isolated pairs of mating flies, forcing them to
be monogamous. They then bred the offspring with the offspring of
other such enforced monogamous pairs, continuing to maintain the
monogamy. And after only 40 generations, the monogamous descendants
produced less harmful seminal fluid.
</P>
<P>
   Once competition between males was no longer a selective force,
producing toxic chemicals apparently became a maladaptive waste of
energy. Freed of the cost of intersexual warfare, these monogamous
flies actually outbred the usual competitive flies.
</P>
<P>
   Just imagine carrying out the same experiment in people. Isolate
some humans and force them and their descendants into monogamy for
a millennium, and we would probably begin to disarm our mammalian
weapons of intresexusal warfare, namely imprinted genes.
</P>
<P>
   The story of imprinted genes is a bit more complicated, but once
paternally derived genes began pushing for the-hell-with-the mom
growth, the battle inevitably escalated.
</P>
<P>
   If the tribe next door shows up at the Paleolithic watering hole
with clubs that seem just a wee bit on the big side for the purpose
of bonking prey animals over the head, the home team will naturally
respond by getting even bigger clubs, just in case. And soon we
have a world with choriocarcinoma, toxic fruit-fly semen, and
umpteen times the education budget buying $600 toilet seats for the
military.
</P>
<P>
   As in so many other arenas of conflict, it's easier to ratchet
up than down.

<P>
   Before the Spanish conquest of what is now Colombia, people in
the mountains north of Bogota are said to have thrown emeralds into
Lake Guatavita.
</P>
<P>
   Once a year the Indian ruler would cover himself with honey and
gold dust and at daybreak have his men row him out into the lake.
As he plunged into the water, offering the gold to his god, the
crowd on shore would throw in their own offerings. The rich ones
chucked in emeralds.
</P>
<P>
   When the Spaniards finally found the Indian emerald mines after
decades of bloody searching, the Old World went crazy for the New
World's gems.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Egyptians had begun mining emeralds near the Red
Sea as early as 1650 B.C. _ and emeralds had long been symbols of
immortality, cures for dysentery and preservers of chastity _ the
new Colombian gems were the clearest, biggest and greenest anyone
in Europe had ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   Emeralds are valuable because they are rare _ rarer than
diamonds. They are rare, says geologist Alain Cheilletz of the
Center for Petrographic and Geochemical Research in Nancy, France,
because they are a mixture of elements that don't ordinarily get a
chance to mix: ``They are a mineral that shouldn't exist at all.''
</P>
<P>
   An emerald is a type of beryl, a mineral made of beryllium,
aluminum, silicon and oxygen. But whereas ordinary beryls are
colorless, emeralds are green because a few of the aluminum atoms
in their crystal structure have been replaced by atoms of chromium
or vanadium.
</P>
<P>
   Neither of those elements has any reason to meet up with
beryllium; they and it belong to two different chemical families
that drifted apart billions of years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after Earth was born, a lot of silicon and aluminum rose to
the surface, then cooled, forming the first continents. Most of the
iron stayed behind in the mantle or sank into the planet's core.
Other elements chose one of those two fates, too, based on their
weight and size.
</P>
<P>
   Because of this parting of the elements, Earth's surface rocks
are segregated into two realms, like yang and yin: light and dark,
crust and mantle, continent and ocean bottom. Geologists call the
light minerals felsic and the dark ones mafic.
</P>
<P>
   The paradox of the emeralds, as Cheilletz calls it, is that
beryllium belongs to the light, felsic, continental side, whereas
chromium and vanadium are from the dark, mafic, oceanic side.
Emeralds, in other words, are yin and yang in a single crystal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole problem in our research,'' Cheilletz says, ``was to
figure out the geologic conditions that could permit these two
elements to meet at the same time and place.''
</P>
<P>
   The answer, they discovered, has to do with plate tectonics, the
ceaseless shifting of Earth's crust that smashes continents
together to build mountains. To make an emerald, those elements
have to come together in a single hot liquid. The most common place
for it to happen is underneath a young mountain range.
</P>
<P>
   Where the edges of two colliding plates stack up, continental
rocks can get dunked so deep into Earth that they melt again,
liberating a great balloon of magma that rises back through the
crust.
</P>
<P>
   At a depth of around six miles, the magma stops, and begins to
cool and solidify as granite. From the top of this cooling mass,
streams of superhot, mineral-laden water _ granite juice _ migrate
upward into fissures in the surrounding rock and begin to leach out
elements.
</P>
<P>
   ``If by chance the granite happens to hit a zone of mafic rock
incorporated in the continental crust, then the chemistry will be
completely different,'' Cheilletz says. ``It will include iron,
magnesium and calcium _ and traces of chromium and vanadium.''
</P>
<P>
   When the felsic-mafic mixture finally freezes, the fissure will
be filled with biotite, a kind of mica. But scattered through the
mica, like green snowflakes, may be emeralds.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the world's known emerald deposits, from the
3-billion-year-old ones in South Africa to the 9-million-year-old
ones in Pakistan, were formed by granite intrusions.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, Cheilletz and his colleague Gaston Giuliani went
to Colombia to have a look at the most renowned emerald mines _ and
soon saw they didn't fit the standard picture.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of granites intruding from below, in Colombia there are
black shales laid down from above _ sedimentary rocks deposited on
the floor of a shallow inland sea during the Cretaceous Period, 100
million years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The sea must have been shallow, because the shales are
sandwiched among layers of salt, which precipitated out of the
water at times when it had all but evaporated. The Colombian shales
contain, in dispersed form, all the ingredients of emeralds.
</P>
<P>
   According to Giuliani and Cheilletz, those ingredients came
together on two distinct occasions, 65 million and 38 million years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Surges in plate motions _ the Atlantic Ocean was getting wider,
pushing South America against the Pacific and raising the Andes _
caused the thick stack of sediments under the shallow sea to
buckle.
</P>
<P>
   Large sloping faults formed several miles down in the sediments,
and hot water was squeezed out of them. Rising through layers of
salt, the 570-degree water became extremely corrosive. Continuing
through layers of shale, it dissolved out the emerald ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   Finally it pooled under a layer of especially impermeable shale
until the pressure became great enough to shatter that layer
explosively.
</P>
<P>
   Then the hot solution shot up through empty cracks in the rock.
As its temperature and pressure plummeted, emerald crystals snowed
out of it immediately. It all happened so fast, says Giuliani, that
the emeralds had no time to grow around grains in the surrounding
shale. They grew unconstrained and pure, without the minerals that
often cloud emeralds found in other parts of the world. That is why
Europeans were so enraptured with the Colombian stones when they
first laid eyes on them in the 16th century.

&HT;        AILING PANDA A LINK TO U.S. CHINA RELATIONS OF YEARS PAST

   WASHINGTON, June 4 -- It was twenty-seven years ago when a pair
of giant panda cubs - Ling-Ling, a female, and Hsing-Hsing, a male
- arrived at the National Zoo as a gift of friendship from the
People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
   Now at a time when the U.S.-China relationship is at a rocky
point, so too is the health of the elderly surviving male panda,
Hsing-Hsing. National Zoo officials announced this week,
Hsing-Hsing (pronounced Shing Shing) - who perhaps is one of the
most symbolic links to a more hopeful time between the two nations
- is suffering from a life threatening illness.
</P>
<P>
   Hsing-Hsing is battling kidney dysfunction that may not be
reversible.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile the nations are recovering from NATO's accidental
bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade and the recently
released Congressional report alleging Chinese espionage of U.S.
military secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Zoo officials say they aren't sure how much longer Hsing-Hsing
has to live. Officials have given the panda medicines and fluids to
hydrate and stabilize his condition.
</P>
<P>
   To treat his arthritis, Hsing-Hsing is also taking
anti-inflammatory drugs, which could aggravate his kidney problems.
But the panda would lose his appetite and energy without it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's feeling better, but Hsing-Hsing's long term prognosis
remains the same, which is not good,'' said National Zoo
spokeswoman Margie Gibson. ``He is very old for a panda. He's lived
a good, long life.'' Zoo officials are hopeful they can get two
more pandas despite, political difficulties. In June, the zoo is
sending a team to China to negotiate for the pandas, Gibson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The zoological relationship has always been separate,'' Gibson
said. ``The pandas are not political even though Hsing Hsing's
illness is at a symbolic point. The zoological relationship is more
open.''
</P>
<P>
   Ling-Ling and Hsing-Hsing attracted thousands of visitors to the
zoo over the years. The pair tried to mate, producing several cubs,
none of whom lived more than a few days. Ling Ling died of old age
in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Giant pandas typically live about 15 years in captivity, Gibson
said. Pandas, native to China, are endangered with only about 1,000
left worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to the panda house this week were greeted with a sign
saying Hsing-Hsing's scheduled feedings had been cancelled and the
panda house may be closed periodically.
</P>
<P>
   Hsing-Hsing looked lethargic in the zoo's panda house on Friday.
He munched bamboo, while slumped a corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's coincidental about the timing of Hsing-Hsing's illness,''
said visitor Jack Good, of Alexandria, Va. ``But what can you do?
These things happen. I'd seen him once before but wanted to see him
again when I heard he was sick.''
</P>
<P>
   Colorful ``get well'' cards from local Washington elementary
school students were displayed near the Panda House. But visitors
from around the nation stopped in to pay a special visit to
Hsing-Hsing.
</P>
<P>
   One visitor, Elaine Pinckney, of Vermont, said the Panda House
was the highlight of her trip to the zoo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd never seen Hsing-Hsing,'' Pinckney said. ``He's so cute.
He's the main attraction.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaning over the railing in front of the Panda House,
14-year-old Travis Ligon, said,: ``He's so cute. I don't want to
leave.''

</P>
<P>
   Visitors to the panda house this week were greeted with a sign
saying Hsing-Hsing's scheduled feedings had been cancelled and the
panda house may be closed periodically.
</P>
<P>
   Hsing-Hsing looked lethargic in the zoo's panda house on Friday.
He munched bamboo, while slumped a corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's coincidental about the timing of Hsing-Hsing's illness,''
said visitor Jack Good, of Alexandria, Va. ``But what can you do?
These things happen. I'd seen him once before but wanted to see him
again when I heard he was sick.''
</P>
<P>
   Colorful ``get well'' cards from local Washington elementary
school students were displayed near the Panda House. But visitors
from around the nation stopped in to pay a special visit to
Hsing-Hsing.
</P>
<P>
   One visitor, Elaine Pinckney, of Vermont, said the Panda House
was the highlight of her trip to the zoo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd never seen Hsing-Hsing,'' Pinckney said. ``He's so cute.
He's the main attraction.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaning over the railing in front of the Panda House,
14-year-old Travis Ligon, said,: ``He's so cute. I don't want to
leave.''

PASSION FOR MUSIC DRIVES CLIBURN AMATEUR PIANISTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WAYNE LEE GAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ A glass installer, a TV news anchor, a hair
stylist, a casino manager, homemakers and doctors. This week, they
will gather in Fort Worth as musicians, along with others, for an
event that will underline the city's position as one of the piano
capitals of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety-two pianists from around the world will compete in the
first International Piano Competition for Outstanding Amateurs on
Wednesday through Sunday at Ed Landreth Auditorium at Texas
Christian University.
</P>
<P>
   Although it's sponsored by the Van Cliburn Foundation, the same
organization that presents the prestigious Van Cliburn
International Piano Competition every four years, the International
Competition for Amateurs is in some ways the opposite of the main
Cliburn Competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mission of the Cliburn Foundation is to propagate
classical music, particularly classical piano music,'' said Richard
Rodzinski, the foundation's executive director. ``Primarily, we do
that through the Cliburn Competition, the concert series, the
recordings, the radio broadcasts and the education program. One
area that we had not brought attention to was the making of music
at home.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cliburn-sponsored amateur competition is open only to people
who are older than 30 and who are not professional pianists or
piano teachers. It doesn't seek to set up a career for the winners;
instead, it aims to recognize the art of the amateur _ the musician
who plays purely for pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the main Cliburn Competition, which will next be
held in 2001, draws a group of young pianists, ages 30 and younger,
who are for the most part already deeply involved in professional
musical careers; it aims to enhance existing careers.
</P>
<P>
   The prize at the amateur competition clearly reflects that these
people are here for the fun of it. While the top prize at the main
Cliburn Competition is valued at more than a quarter of a million
dollars when engagements and perks are added up, the top prize at
the amateur competition is $2,000 cash, a pair of subscriptions to
the main Cliburn Competition, a collection of compact discs and the
opportunity to appear with an orchestra in Paris sometime before
2005.
</P>
<P>
   The amateur competition will also serve as a testing ground for
several new ideas for the main competition. A new jury scoring
system will replace the old ``pass/no pass'' system, in which each
juror voted simply for or against sending a competitor to the next
round. Under the new system, devised by mathematician John McBain
of Delphi Automotive Systems and successfully applied to the
Indianapolis International Violin Competition, jurors will be able
to give higher scores to competitors they particularly favor.
</P>
<P>
   Rodzinski says that the new system has been adopted for the main
Cliburn Competition. Other ideas being tested, but which have not
yet been adopted for the 2001 Cliburn, include the awarding of an
audience favorite award, decided by the vote of audience members at
the final round, and a special press jury award given by attending
music critics.
</P>
<P>
   Juror John Owings, head of the piano department at TCU and a
past winner of the Casadesus International Piano Competition, said
serving on this jury will be different than at usual piano
competitions for aspiring professional performers. ``I'll have to
get a sense of what the level of playing is,'' he said. ``But
musicality will always be the main thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Owings has heard several of the competitors play in master
classes at TCU in conjunction with the special Amateurs Week at the
TCU/Cliburn Piano Institute, and said that the quality of playing
may be quite high.
</P>
<P>
   The Fort Worth amateur competition is not the first event of its
type. In 1989, French music lover Gerard Bekerman founded the
Concours des Grands Amateurs de Piano, which has been held annually
in Paris. Bekerman has enthusiastically endorsed the
Cliburn-sponsored amateur competition, and will assist the jury in
Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   How frequently the Cliburn amateur competition will occur has
not been determined. The response has been enthusiastic enough that
it almost certainly will be repeated, probably every two or four
years.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the last preparations for the competition are taking
place in living rooms around the world. While the main Cliburn
Competition quadrennially brings 35 of the most talented young
pianists in the world to Fort Worth, the amateur competition has
drawn an extraordinary mixture of occupations.
</P>
<P>
   Competitors include Lauren Green, news anchor for Fox News in
New York, and Michael Kimmelman, chief art critic for The New York
Times, along with professors, many computer programmers and
computer scientists, and several doctors and lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Close to home, Judith Sherrard of Grapevine, 45 years old and
the mother of three children, ages 5, 8 and 12, will compete with a
program of Poulenc, Scarlatti and Mendelssohn. A graduate of
Arlington High School in Arlington, Sherrard majored in piano
briefly at Indiana University before switching to English
literature; she taught at Galveston College before becoming a
full-time homemaker.
</P>
<P>
   For Sherrard, as for most of the competitors, playing the piano
is just part of a much fuller life. She plays when she can on her
1903 Steinway grand, but gets in most of her practicing on a rented
electronic piano that can be silenced while everyone else in the
house sleeps. She admits that she occasionally finds G.I. Joe or a
Barbie shoe hidden away inside the grand, and that everyone in the
family has heard her music quite a lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even the dog knows the music by now,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   But, she says, ``I've never played better in my life.''
</P>
<P>

HIGHER TICKETS PRICES NOT LIKELY TO GROUND SUMMER TRAVELERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: Stands for SF-TOURISM))  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVID ARMSTRONG  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Airline fares are up 11 percent since the first
of the year for leisure travel, but travel and tourism industry
representatives say that's not steep enough to keep people from
traveling this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, they say, the season promises to be lively for travelers
and prosperous for places that rely on tourist dollars.
</P>
<P>
   As of June 1, Continental, American, Northwest, Delta, United
and TWA had increased their seven-, 14- and 21-day advance fares.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Anthony, a spokeswoman for Atlanta-based Delta Airlines,
said the increases were only for leisure fares, although business
fares have seen industrywide increases of 3 percent so far this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's based on supply and demand, and the market dictates
fares,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Continental spokesman Ned Walker agreed that demand is driving
up ticket prices: ``We continue to carry record loads in many of
our markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the latest increases leave some people in the travel
industry exasperated.
</P>
<P>
   James Ashurst, a spokesman for the American Society of Travel
Agents, which has feuded with the airline industry over lower
commissions for agents, said: ``It just illustrates how desperately
we need competition in this industry. In most industries, if
consumers are squeezed, they can look for alternatives. In this
industry, the carriers move in lockstep.''
</P>
<P>
   Might rising airfares drive people to drive to their summer
destinations? That depends, said Ashurst, whose organization
representing 28,600 travel agents is based in Arlington, Va.
</P>
<P>
   ``Internationally, top destinations are London, Paris, Rome.
Domestically, you're looking at Orlando, Las Vegas, New York.
People in San Francisco could probably drive to Las Vegas. But you
can't drive to Hawaii, and there isn't a train. Consumers are
stuck. Who has four weeks to take off to drive to Orlando?''
</P>
<P>
   Ashurst said there had not been a wave of cancellations because
of higher ticket prices. ``But when is enough enough?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   David S. Stempler, president of the Washington, D.C.-based Air
Travelers Association, noted that the increases are not
significant.
</P>
<P>
   ``The latest fare increase is 4 percent,'' he said. ``A person
flying from San Francisco to Boston on a $600 leisure fare is going
to see the price go up $25. I don't think it will make a
difference. The economy is strong, and people have money jingling
in their pockets.''
</P>
<P>
   While he doesn't think travel will be down this summer, Stempler
said more competition would be good for travelers. He said the
government can play a role by encouraging more runways, terminals
and gates to give new carriers access to airports.
</P>
<P>
   He said such improvements would prove more useful than federal
legislation calling for a ``bills of rights'' for passengers. The
bills typically call for more information for passengers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can certainly support that,'' Stempler said. But some of
the bills advocate providing financial incentives to airlines to
improve on-time records.
</P>
<P>
   ``The primary reasons for delays are weather, air traffic
control or mechanical problems,'' Stempler said. ``We think it's a
very bad idea in terms of safety to invoke financial penalties for
delays.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the crash last week of an American Airlines jet
that landed during a storm at the Little Rock airport in Arkansas,
killing 9 people, he said: ``We don't want a pilot saying, `I think
I can get out of here before that thunderstorm hits,' because it
might save money.''
</P>
<P>
   Delays and prices increases won't keep from people from
traveling this summer, said Mike Pina, manager of media relations
for the Travel Industry Association of America. He said the
Washington, D.C.-based trade group projects a 4 percent increase in
the number of domestic leisure travelers this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It went up 7 percent last year and went up 11 percent the year
before that,'' he said.

BASEBALL FAN PITCHES A HOME RUN IN `BATTLE CREEK' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EDVINS BEITIKS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Scott Lasser turned the battered baseball glove
over and over in his hand. It was a Wilson A2000 model Lasser
hadn't seen in more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Lasser, offering readings from his new baseball novel, ``Battle
Creek'' (William Morrow and Co. $24. 266 pages), got the glove
earlier that week from his sister, who wound up with it when her
brother went from playing the outfield to first base at Andover
High School in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I've seen this glove since '77,'' said Lasser, a
bonds trader on Wall Street who wrote the bulk of ``Battle Creek''
while commuting to work from Westchester County, N.Y. ``My sister
returning it, after all these years, that's great.''
</P>
<P>
   Lasser's younger sister, Kelly, a San Francisco designer, said
she was not surprised her brother's first book is about baseball.
``It was almost a religion in our family,'' she said. ``I had to
throw the ball for an hour in the back yard before I could eat
dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime I show up for a softball game they're always impressed
I have an A2000,'' said Lasser, who got the glove from her father.
``He instilled discipline in us. He'd tell us that, in baseball,
you're never alone out there. It's a team game.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Lasser, 37, said he wasn't sure his first novel would be
about baseball until after he'd started it. Drawing on his own
playing days and his father's lifelong commitment to the game,
Lasser created a book in which raw rookies and weather-beaten
veterans team up to try and win Michigan's semipro Single-A
championship at Battle Creek.
</P>
<P>
   At last month's reading, Lasser chose a chapter on Ben Mercer,
an aging pitcher who's trying to sneak up a wooden fire escape to
see a woman 10 years younger than he is. Talking to himself, he
falls through a railing into a compost heap 12 feet below.
</P>
<P>
   ``His ankle is on fire,'' Lasser reads. ``He rolls about in the
rotting grapefruit rinds and coffee grounds, an organic ooze of
squash an potato skins, egg shells, long-forgotten tomatoes, and
newly formed mold ... he does what any man in his situation would
do: he rises to his feet, wipes himself off, and heads for his
car.''
</P>
<P>
   The focus of ``Battle Creek,'' though, is Gil Davison, manager
of the team Mercer pitches for, Koch and Sons. Davison, in his 60s,
has a love affair with baseball that overwhelms him as he stands in
the dugout at the championship tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember this, Gil tells himself, knowing that he will not do
it again. Remember how it looks, with one inning to go, three outs,
to the win. Remember the people standing with their fingers hooked
through the metal fence, remember the milky blue of the stadium
paint and the similar color of the sky. Remember the cereal ads
hanging from the outfield fence, and the sound of practice
grounders rolling across the infield an the jumping dust in their
wake ...''
</P>
<P>
   Lasser said his high school playing days came back to him while
writing ``Battle Creek,'' along with passages from some of his
favorite baseball books: ``The Natural,'' by Bernard Malamud;
``Veracruz Blues,'' a contemporary novel of baseball in Mexico; and
``A False Spring,'' a nearly forgotten book about Pat Jordan's
rookie spring with the Milwaukee Braves.
</P>
<P>
   Each book ``helps you to see through the game and why people
play it,'' he said, adding, ``I never set out to write about
baseball. I didn't really think it was a legitimate literary topic.
But the more I thought about it, the more I got tied up with it,
through my father, through my youth.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming from Detroit, Lasser grew up a Tigers fan. ``Being a
Tigers fan is an education,'' he said. ``A long and painful road.
But then you have the '68 Tigers ... you can't take a memory like
that away.''
</P>
<P>
   Lasser, whose next projects are a book of short stories and a
novel about Wall Street, is not sure why baseball holds such a
special place in the heart of America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Football and basketball are truly American games, too,'' he
said, ``but there's something about baseball that is very
compelling, especially for a writer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's because it's a summer game, the sounds of it, the
smells of it. The smells of cut grass, of infield dirt, of summer
games at night ... distinctively physical touches.''
</P>
<P>
   There's the father-son thing, too, said Lasser, who's been
tossing the ball around with his 9-year-old son, Charlie, who plays
in Little League. ``The game just gets a hold of you and won't let
go.''

FOR ART ATTACKS, CALL AN AMIENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Once again San Francisco has fallen behind
Silicon Valley. The city of Mountain View, population 54,206, main
export software, has an ``Ambience Committee.''
</P>
<P>
   I assume that's spelled ``ambience,'' the English way, rather
than ambiance, the French way. Mountain View surely can't be that
uppity.
</P>
<P>
   The other day, when KTVU-TV reported that Mountain View has an
Ambience Committee, everyone in my newsroom fell over laughing.
</P>
<P>
   When I came to the San Francisco Bay area 22 years ago, I lived
in an Eichler (a kind of tract home that now has cachet, pardon the
French) in Mountain View. If the town had an Ambience Committee
then, it required homeowners to park pickups in driveways, and
developers to build theme malls with corny wooden mills.
</P>
<P>
   The best ambience in all of Mountain View was in the tiny La
Poblanita restaurant on Castro Street. It wasn't because the decor
was anything, but because the customers were so happy eating the
fine chile verde.
</P>
<P>
   That was ambient. But La Poblanita is gone now, and Castro
Street, like all of Silicon Valley, glitters with the ambience of
stock options and BMWs.
</P>
<P>
   It's not an accident that the head of Mountain View's Ambience
Committee is the city's economic development manager.
</P>
<P>
   Give the guy credit. His committee banned white plastic chairs
at outdoor restaurants. Those chairs look cheap even sitting in
Kmart.
</P>
<P>
   If they'd been invented in 1977, I wouldn't have put one in my
Eichler.
</P>
<P>
   After my pals and I quit laughing about Mountain View's attempt
at civic upward mobility, we thought a little more about it.
</P>
<P>
   If the Ambience Committee in Mountain View can outlaw white
plastic chairs in outdoor restaurants because they look cheesy,
imagine what a city with San Francisco's ambience can do.
</P>
<P>
   And, man, do we love committees. San Francisco already has a
Toilet Commission, and people actually agree to sit on it _ the
commission, I mean.
</P>
<P>
   Think how our nobility, not to mention their esthetics sheriff,
Stanlee Gatti, would clamor to sit on an ambience committee.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, the committee would have to decide what San
Francisco's ambience is, or even if we'd use that word. It's a
froufrou word that sounds classy to people who strive too hard to
have class.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Mayor Willie Brown would like it, so ambience it
is.
</P>
<P>
   Pray to San Francisco's raffish gods that Brown doesn't appoint
the entire San Francisco Ambience Committee. If that happened, the
City Hall dress code of suit and tie would be extended to every
coffeehouse and rock concert in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Every building would have to have a gold-leaf dome on top, like
the mayor's big gilded hat on top of City Hall. But it would have
to be smaller.
</P>
<P>
   A Brown-dominated Ambience Committee would eliminate his most
hated thing, clutter. There would be no clutter of news boxes on
the streets to bring a clutter of bad news to all those squalling,
messy people.
</P>
<P>
   The really messy, the homeless, would be shipped out in the name
of quality of ambience.
</P>
<P>
   There would be no clutter of candidates running against Brown
either, because he fiercely believes he's the best thing for San
Francisco ambience since the invention of fog.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco, if Brown was dictating the decor (and he is),
would be one big hotel that only a few people can afford.
</P>
<P>
   That's the way it would go with an Ambience Committee of one.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's popularity has diminished. So now is the time to load
the San Francisco Ambience Committee with people who don't use the
word ``ambience'' _ or think it's what they don't get right away
after dialing 911.
</P>
<P>
   To maintain a real San Francisco ambience, the Ambience
Committee should be a rainbow of ambient enlightenment itself. It
should include gays of all orientations, Art Deco or otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   It should include white heterosexual males of the Giants'
windbreaker persuasion.
</P>
<P>
   The Ambience Committee should include computer geeks in black
vinyl jackets, old folks in gardening gear, mechanics in
grease-stained overalls and rich kids in rolled-up jeans that will
never be stained by anything greasier than drippings from their
Thai smoked duck wraps.
</P>
<P>
   The committee also should include members of the cap-backwards
community, even if they're getting hard to find because the new
style is caps with brims all the way around, so you can't tell when
they're backwards.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, when you talk about ambience in San Francisco, you come
back to people.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know how an Ambience Committee can save people from high
rents and ugly lofts, but I know something about San Francisco
committees. If we get all those folks on a committee, they won't
agree on anything.
</P>
<P>
   Let a hundred San Francisco ambiences bloom. But don't call it
ambience. Maybe Silicon Valley's aura and cafe chairs need
cleansing, but not ours in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   INDONESIA-BALLOTING (Dadap) _ As the ballot counting began in

   ARIZ-CHARTER-SCHOOLS (Phoenix) _ Most states _ including New
York, where the first charter schools are to open in the fall _ are
just beginning to grapple with a future in which families will be
able to choose among dozens of public schools operating under
charters that hold them to state standards, but give them freedom
to experiment and independence in hiring and spending. But Arizona

schools, more than 70 in Phoenix alone, serving nearly 5 percent of
all students. By Tamar Lewin.

   SCI-FREE-HEROIN-PROGRAM (New York) _ Taking a bold approach to

broadcast TV networks for the 1999-2000 season, which begins in
September, is exceeding even the most optimistic forecasts made by

LAWYERS GIRD FOR A DATE WITH DESTINY _ JAN. 1, 2000 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ALAN WECHSLER  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ It was the opening day of Produce Palace, a
gourmet grocery store in a Detroit suburb. But business was over
not long after it started.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours into the day, a customer produced a credit card with
an expiration date of 00, as in the year 2000. The store's
computerized register couldn't comprehend this oddity and crashed.
Customers lined up 20 deep, and then finally stormed out.
</P>
<P>
   That was in 1995, and store owner Mike Yarsike had just become
one of the first victims of a Y2K problem. Soon after, he also
became one of the first people to file a Y2K lawsuit _ in this case
against the maker of his registers. In 1998, he agreed to a
$260,000 settlement from manufacturer TEC America Inc. of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   It is estimated the cost of getting the nation's computers and
electronic equipment ready to accept the year 2000 will be in the
tens of billions of dollars. That may pale next to the cost of Y2K
lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people are predicting this is going to be as big as the
tobacco industry (lawsuits),'' said Jonathan Summers, a lawyer for
Thuillez, Ford, Gold &AMP; Johnson in Albany.
</P>
<P>
   Summers attended a Y2K seminar in New Orleans last year, and
since then has been keeping an eye on Y2K legal issues. While he
hasn't filed any lawsuits, he has talked to a number of clients
about protecting themselves from possible lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real avalanche of litigation isn't going to occur until
after Jan. 1, assuming there are breakdowns,'' he said. ``We're all
kind of sitting back, waiting to see what's going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   As Dec. 31 approaches, many businesses that could be affected by
the Y2K computer bug are readying themselves on two fronts:
ensuring the machinery will work, and ensuring the business won't
be sued if it doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   Computer experts fear that many computers originally programmed
to recognize only the last two digits of a year will fail or
malfunction on Jan. 1, 2000, when the machines might assume it is
1900.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, if there's losses, there's going to be litigation,''
Summers said. ``If there's a pocket out there somebody can point
to, there's going to be litigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Around the country, lawsuits have already started. In the past
few years, IBM, AT&AMP;T and Lucent Technologies have all been sued for
selling programs or equipment with Y2K problems. A California
lawsuit claims some stores, including Circuit City and CompUSA,
failed to warn consumers about Year 2000 problems in equipment,
like VCRs or computers, purchased at those stores.
</P>
<P>
   Most insurance companies, meanwhile, have announced they will
not cover Y2K lawsuits. Businesses, insurers say, should have seen
it coming and should have done something about it.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance companies are sending letters out to their customers,
said Joe Distell, an agent with Reidman Insurance of West Sand
Lake, N.Y. He specializes in commercial insurance.
</P>
<P>
   And that, he said, could lead to further lawsuits _ clients
suing their insurers, claiming the companies have no right to say
they won't cover Y2K problems.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, legislation is being proposed across the United
States in an effort to protect against an onslaught of Y2K-related
lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   On the federal end, the bills include attempts to limit awards,
a requirement giving companies an opportunity to fix Y2K problems
before being sued and protection for retailers that sell faulty
products made by other companies.
</P>
<P>
   More than 30 states are working on Y2K bills. At least 11 have
enacted some. Most are geared to protecting companies.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers are generally opposed to legislation that protects
companies. Walter Effross, a professor at the Washington College of
Law at American University in Washington, D.C., said such laws are
just a cop-out for companies that knew about Y2K problems for years
but ignored them until too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is clearly not the case of manufacturers all of a sudden
waking up to the fact that there's something wrong,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Effross, who recently testified before a House of
Representatives Y2K subcommittee, said companies can take simple
measures to protect themselves: stock up on inventory if they're
worried about suppliers, contact equipment manufacturers to see if
key machinery is Y2K compliant and, if the company manufactures
software, either make sure the program works or get upgrades to
customers as fast as possible.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   John Polster, a lawyer with DeLorenzo, Pasquariello and Weiskoph
in Schenectady, N.Y., said there were many reasons why a company
could be sued for a Y2K problem.
</P>
<P>
   A supply company could be sued if its plant breaks down and it
can't supply what has been promised. A stockbroker could be sued
for recommending the stock from a company that loses value if it is
not compliant. And a company can be sued if it sells a product
that, like the registers at the Produce Palace outside Detroit,
breaks down.
</P>
<P>
   Polster, who spent the past six months learning all he could
about Y2K, is preparing for what could be a very busy year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It upsets me there are so many people doing nothing,'' he
said. ``And there are people who will be injured as a result of
their inaction.''

<P>
   Abandoning a stay-at-home strategy that has made him the stealth
candidate of Campaign 2000 _ unseen but feared by opponents _ the
governor will leave Texas for the first time this week to defend
his status as the Republican presidential front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   Few political debuts have generated so much interest. After
weeks of enjoying favorable polls from the comfort of the
Governor's Mansion, Bush will finally confront the swirling demands
of sky-high expectations, pent-up media skepticism and the
indignities that come with dusk-to-dawn campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   At least 100 reporters and photographers plan to join Bush in
Austin on Saturday as he sets off on a four-day swing to Iowa and
New Hampshire, the traditional leadoff states for presidential
politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a media circus,'' said Dennis Goldford, a
political science professor at Drake University in Des Moines,
Iowa. ``This is hardball. He may have owned the Texas Rangers, but
I don't know if he can play hardball.''
</P>
<P>
   For Bush's GOP rivals, the trip marks a welcome new phase in
what promises to be a grueling struggle for the Republican
nomination. After weeks of shadow boxing with a front-runner who
refused to leave his corner, they might finally get a chance to
land a punch.
</P>
<P>
   Ten other Republicans have acknowledged White House ambitions,
but none comes close to Bush in early presidential polls. The first
nominating contests will not occur until February.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let the campaign begin,'' said Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for
Elizabeth Dole. ``The governor has a sizable first-place lead. The
question is, `Can he hold it?' ''
</P>
<P>
   The road to the White House is littered with the wreckage of
other campaigns that began in Texas. Former Sen. Lloyd Bentsen in
1976, former Gov. John Connally in 1980 and Sen. Phil Gramm in 1996
all learned the hard way that promising poll numbers and a long
list of wealthy donors do not guarantee success.
</P>
<P>
   But none of them started with as much potential as Bush, who is
far ahead of his rivals in terms of campaign contributions,
endorsements and poll support.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor raised $7.6 million in the first three months
of the year without even holding a fund-raiser. Aides said he is on
track to more than double that amount in the second quarter. At
least 16 of the nation's 31 Republican governors have endorsed him.
</P>
<P>
   Now he has to show that the support is justified. Although other
candidates have the luxury of committing their early campaign
blunders while almost no one is watching, Bush will be in the
spotlight from the moment he climbs on his campaign plane.
</P>
<P>
   It has been called the political equivalent of opening a
Broadway play without rehearsals.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who repeated his daughter's assessment to reporters last
week, said he is eager to hit the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've read all the stories and I've seen the TV about politics
in the year 2000,'' he said. ``Now I need to go out and look people
in the eye and hear what they have to say.''
</P>
<P>
   In Iowa, Bush will be the featured attraction at separate
fund-raisers for two congressmen, Reps. James Nussle and Greg
Ganske. At least 2,000 Iowans are expected to turn out for Ganske's
event at the state fairgrounds in Des Moines.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bulk of his time will be spent shaking everybody's hand.
The hard part is shaking everybody's hand and having 100 cameras
trying to get the same shot,'' said campaign spokeswoman Mindy
Tucker.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's crowded New Hampshire schedule includes a mix of formal
events and up-close-and-personal campaigning. The Texas governor
plans to greet early morning shift workers at a plant in Derry,
chat with diners at a restaurant and drop by a fire station.
</P>
<P>
   Bush will take time out Sunday to celebrate his father's 75th
birthday with other family members in Kennebunkport, Maine, which
served as a summer White House for former President Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The shake-down cruise to Iowa and New Hampshire is a prelude to
a busy month that will include a five-day swing to the East Coast,
Pennsylvania and Michigan, and a four-day trip to California.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Pitney, a political science professor at Claremont McKenna
College in Claremont, Calif., said Bush does not necessarily have
to dazzle audiences, but he does have to avoid any embarrassing
gaffes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is looking for the stumble,'' Pitney said. ``He
needs to show that he can campaign effectively and that he can
handle issues smoothly even when he's evading them. He doesn't have
to solve Kosovo. He only needs to pronounce it.''

   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. _ It started with a rash of tornadoes in late
January that killed seven and injured 55 in the Little Rock area.
</P>
<P>
   In May, 13 people drowned when a tour boat sank in Hot Springs.
</P>
<P>
   The tragedies, coupled with Tuesday's deadly crash of American
Airlines Flight 1420, have some people in Arkansas wondering when
the state is going to get a break from bad news.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I'm getting a little numb to it,'' said Roger Andrews
Jr., a 32-year-old Sherwood, Ark., resident who was at Little Rock
National Airport on Friday when passengers who were on the
ill-fated flight returned to view the wreckage. ``Maybe we should
just all leave the state.''
</P>
<P>
   Arkansas is hardly alone in dealing with an unusually high
number of tragedies this year. Nationwide, the drumbeat of disaster
has been pounding the collective psyche of Americans on a regular
basis.
</P>
<P>
   In April, 14 students and a teacher died in the Columbine High
School shootings near Littleton, Colo. In early May, dozens of
tornadoes killed 44 in the Oklahoma City area. Six days later, a
bus accident near New Orleans killed 22.
</P>
<P>
   The frequency of the events and the intense media coverage may
contribute to people being desensitized to the plight of those hit
by tragedy, experts said.
</P>
<P>
   That response, said one Little Rock counselor, is a matter of
survival.
</P>
<P>
   ``We develop mechanisms to deal with trauma in our lives,'' said
Cheryl Campbell, who has studied the effects of trauma and stress.
``When there's a lot of trauma going on, you get desensitized.''
</P>
<P>
   If the incidents that have resulted in multiple deaths and loss
of property had been spread over time, people might have responded
differently to each tragedy, experts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People heal over time,'' said Ralph Hyman, who teaches
psychiatry to residents at the University of Arkansas for Medical
Services. ``If trauma happens in a short period of time, people
haven't healed, and so they become numbed.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's crash was yet another trauma that Americans have gone
through together. But it seemed to some, who were not directly
touched by the accident, to be not as tragic, more like a major car
accident.
</P>
<P>
   The plane landed where it was supposed to, it happened at night,
and the wreckage wasn't accessible to the masses, except via
photographs and videotape.
</P>
<P>
   Nine people lost their lives Tuesday night, but a plane crash
does not reveal a larger-picture issue, such as the Columbine
shootings and the subsequent discussions about guns in the hands of
youngsters, child rearing and violence in the media, experts said.
</P>
<P>
   John Sommerville, a history professor at the University of
Florida in Gainesville, Fla., and author of How the News Makes Us
Dumb, said that the crash was an isolated incident and that unless
people want to identify and empathize with the victims, they don't
really get involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always struck me as odd that plane crashes chase
everything else off the page when they have no larger political or
social context,'' Sommerville said. ``They just scare us more than
anything else, and that's what the news is good at _ creating
anxieties and insecurities.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who did not consider the crash to be tragic might be
looking at the glass as half-full, said an instructor at the
Poynter Institute of Media Studies in St. Petersburg, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be that people are looking at how many people survived
vs. what could have happened,'' said Aly Colon, who teaches ethics
and diversity at the institute. ``They might be pleased it isn't a
greater tragedy. ... That might have an impact. If people are
noting that so many people got out alive and it could have been
worse, that could cause people to be more accepting, though not
necessarily pleased about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The relatively low number of fatalities in the crash likely
contributed to the life-goes-on atmosphere in Little Rock and its
airport just a day after the crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``With nine deaths, the Red Cross doesn't have to go out and get
a school gymnasium,'' said Janet Sonier, a crisis counselor in Fort
Worth. ``There's not the impact on the community.''
</P>
<P>
   The recent images of death and destruction across the country
might lead people to perceive the crash as a ``here we go again''
situation, experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Colon echoed that assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it becomes very difficult over a period of time to
sustain the surprise and shock to the tremendous amount of tragic
news that continues to flood the news media,'' Colon said. ``In
this case, you are dealing with an event that happened and was
somewhat isolated with one particular airplane.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the glut of information that is permeating all
different types of media is going to at some point begin to dull
the sensitivity that people have to it,'' she said. ``The element
of surprise, of newness, of freshness begins to wear. People need
to take a break.''
</P>
<P>
   To Charlie Robinson of West Helena, Ark., each of the tragedies
in Arkansas has been disturbing, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson and his father were in Little Rock on Friday to buy
automobile parts and stopped by the airport. Sitting on the
tailgate of a pickup, they used binoculars to try to get a view of
the crash site.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like we're hit one time after another,'' Robinson
said. ``I don't know what we've got to do to catch a break, but it
just seems like we can't catch one right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty upsetting.''
</P>
<P>
   In Russellville, Ark., it was clear that the deaths of six
residents who were on Flight 1420 has not numbed the town's
reaction, said Rick Fahr, a reporter at The Courier, the town's
daily newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have seen just exactly the opposite,'' he said. ``We didn't
just lose John Q. Public walking down the street. These people were
heavily involved in the community.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has got to be something that stays with them
(townspeople) the rest of their lives.''

 &UR; BC-MILLEN-ADVENTURE-WHY-GO &LR;  -- Why do people seek adventure?
Surviving the unusual, from kayaking to space travel, means
stepping across an inner boundary. It's in those moments when you
go from calmness to curiosity to worry to panic that you learn the
most and your life changes _ and you have a wonderful time. By
Andrea Barrett, who won the National Book Award for ``Ship Fever.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLEN-ADVENTURE-HUCK &LR;  -- Mark Twain launched a fictional
adventure 115 years ago that still resonates: A village boy named
Huck Finn and a fugitive slave named Jim raft down the Mississippi
River together. In a latter-day version, essayist Stanley Crouch
and Southern novelist Richard Ford set out to see how life, and
race relations, have changed. Here is an account by Crouch, author
of ``Notes of A Hanging Judge,'' a New York Daily News columnist
and a former commentator for CBS' ``60 Minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLEN-ADVENTURE-FOREST &LR;  -- He took the No. 4 train, got off at
Fordham Road and hiked to a huge wall of trees with a tiny sign in
front: ``The Forest.'' He got an OK from the security guard, picked
up his knapsack full of Kit-Kat bars, sour pickles and V-8 juice,
clipped an emergency beeper to his tent and strode into New York
City's last primeval forest. That night he met a coyote and a skunk
_ and attained the urban adventurer's version of Thoreau's inner
peace. By Charles Siebert, who wrote ``Wickerby: An Urban
Pastoral.''

</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLEN-ADVENTURE-FINN &LR;  -- For Richard Ford, heading down the
Mississippi River in the same boat with Stanley Crouch was an
opportunity to confront a difficult truth about himself _ and the
limits of thinking in black and white. The Pulitzer Prize-winning
novelist's books include ``The Sportswriter.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLEN-ADVENTURE-SAINT &LR;  -- Walking and giving, walking and
singing, walking and praying: That's what one medieval Italian
roustabout did, and his path over a desolate Umbrian landscape
became a proving ground for sainthood. This author retraces the
steps of St. Francis of Assisi and finds out why he talked to birds
and flowers, and why fish refused to die in his hands and hunted
animals sought refuge at his side. By Gretel Ehrlich, who wrote
``Questions of Heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLEN-ADVENTURE-BRAIN &LR;  -- Brain scans can locate the home of
memory and the land of language. They may eventually help to map
consciousness. This ``traveler'' enters the narrow mouth of a
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) machine at Memorial Sloan Cancer
Center in New York. The scans show 226,000,000 data points in 21
``slices'' of his brain and lead him on a journey to the center of
his mind. By Stephen S. Hall, a contributing science writer for The
New York Times Magazine.

Millennium Plus partnership package. &LR;

<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLEN-CARTOON-MACK &LR;  -- ``Overheard at the Explorer's Club,'' a
cartoon by Stan Mack, is a witty, urbane view of the sort of folks
who study the whales of the Galapagos and find mystical qualities
in the gallstones of llamas ... and then gather to talk about it
all in fancy ballrooms with crystal chandeliers and dainty hors
d'oeuvres. (Available in 35mm slide or via electronic transmission)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLEN-ADVENTURE-NIGERIA &LR;  -- Still they come, close to a million
legal immigrants every year, for a new life in America. The first
census, in 1790, counted 3.9 million Americans. Today, with
ceaseless immigration, there are 275 million. For Murphy Popoola, a
Nigerian, to become an American is an escape. But it may also be a
way to return to Nigeria as a citizen of the world. By Roger Cohen,
the Berlin bureau chief of The New York Times and author of
``Hearts Grown Brutal: Sagas of Sarajevo.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLEN-ADVENTURE-YOUTH &LR;  -- It's after college. Do you know where
your young people are? Here are profiles of six youthful wanderers
who, in an era of packaged tours, set out on their own for remote
corners of the globe to find danger, surprise, odd people and very
bizarre food. By Leslie Downer, a London-based writer who
hitchhiked from Greece to India in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLEN-ADVENTURE-TECH &LR;  -- In a wired world, it's time to pull
the plug. Thanks to beepers, cell phones, faxes and Global Village
modems, a traveler simply can't get lost. Here's an idea: Climb
1,300 feet above the Pacific Ocean to a Benedictine hermitage _ a
place where friends and bosses can't reach you _ and where you,
therefore, can reach a deeper self. By Pico Iyer, the author of
``Tropical Classical'' and, coming out this winter, ``The Global
Soul.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLEN-ADVENTURE-CEZANNE &LR;  -- Cezanne worshiped Mounte
Ste.-Victoire as the epitome of Nature at its most sublime. And
Petrarch climbed Mount Ventoux to commune with the gods. But the
author, a decidedly urban traveler, scales the peaks _ and
concludes that mountains, far from sublime, are like glorified
Stairmasters for the upwardly mobile. By Michael Kimmelman, chief
art critic for The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLEN-ADVENTURE-CHINA &LR;  -- Decades before Columbus, Zheng He
sailed from China with 300 ships and 28,000 men. His fleet got as
far as Africa and could have easily reached America, but the
Chinese turned back. What happened? By Nicholas D. Kristof, Tokyo
bureau chief of The New York Times and the author, with Sheryl
WuDunn, of ``China Wakes.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLEN-ADVENTURE-BOOKS &LR;  -- Armchair adventure, anyone? We like
stories of dangerous exploits, tales of high altitudes and deep
water. Adventure novels keep us entertained _ and alive. We love
legends of people who come out alive after terrible experiences.
Beyond mere escapism, travel stories help us discern the limits of
human frailty, prepare for the unexpected and imagine what we'd do
in perilous circumstances. By Annie Proulx, the author, most
recently, of ``Close Range,'' a collection of short stories.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLEN-ADVENTURE-WORDS &LR;  -- The word ``adventurer'' has had a
wild ride through the millennium. Today, to be ``adventuresome'' is
to be bold and daring, to take risks without a connotation of
heedlessness or imprudence. Saunter back a few decades, though, and
``adventurer'' meant a brawler, a plunderer, and even the Devil
himself. By William Safire, the veteran New York Times political
analyst and ``On Language'' columnist for The Times Magazine.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLEN-ADVENTURE-OCEAN &LR;  -- A novelist sent to the bottom of the
sea finds illumination in the darkest of places. His bird's-eye
view is provided by the bubble cockpit of a Johnson-Sea-Link
submersible, a robotic, eerily anthropomorphic, high-tech
contraption with baskets, tentacles and mobile arms. There he can
say hello to angel-fish, deep-sea fireflies and whales about 1,043
feet below the sunny, sparkling waters off Chub Cay in the Bahamas.
By Robert Stone, author of seven books including ``Damascus Gate.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLEN-ADVENTURE-DISASTER &LR;  -- Ever go on a journey that turns
out worse than staying home? Here's a log of low travel points of
the millennium, from the 14th century, when a Moroccan explorer
nearly died from food poisoning, to the 20th century, when a
British climber failed to make it up Nanga Parbat, because he
sneezed. A succinct report on explorers who should have stayed in
bed that day. By John Tierney, a columnist for The New York Times
Magazine.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLEN-ADVENTURE-SAVOY &LR;  -- After discovering lost Incan cities,
Gene Savoy is searching for something truly exotic: the Fountain of
Youth. Savoy, the 72-year-old travel journalist and explorer, is
sailing around the world in a catamaran, with a crew of middle-age
men _ and BBC cameras on board. By Brad Wetzler, a writer for
Outside magazine and a contributing editor for George.

 &UR; BC-MILLEN-ADVENTURE-WHY-GO &LR;  -- Why do people seek adventure?
Surviving the unusual, from kayaking to space travel, means
stepping across an inner boundary. It's in those moments when you
go from calmness to curiosity to worry to panic that you learn the
most and your life changes _ and you have a wonderful time. By
Andrea Barrett, who won the National Book Award for ``Ship Fever.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLEN-ADVENTURE-HUCK &LR;  -- Mark Twain launched a fictional
adventure 115 years ago that still resonates: A village boy named
Huck Finn and a fugitive slave named Jim raft down the Mississippi
River together. In a latter-day version, essayist Stanley Crouch
and Southern novelist Richard Ford set out to see how life, and
race relations, have changed. Here is an account by Crouch, author
of ``Notes of A Hanging Judge,'' a New York Daily News columnist
and a former commentator for CBS' ``60 Minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLEN-ADVENTURE-FOREST &LR;  -- He took the No. 4 train, got off at
Fordham Road and hiked to a huge wall of trees with a tiny sign in
front: ``The Forest.'' He got an OK from the security guard, picked
up his knapsack full of Kit-Kat bars, sour pickles and V-8 juice,
clipped an emergency beeper to his tent and strode into New York
City's last primeval forest. That night he met a coyote and a skunk
_ and attained the urban adventurer's version of Thoreau's inner
peace. By Charles Siebert, who wrote ``Wickerby: An Urban
Pastoral.''

 &UR; MAPPING the MILLENNIUM: ``Points of No Return'' ... A Chronicle of
reminders that traveling the globe is a risky business. &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; By Stephen Mihm &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; Artwork availability: 35mm color slides or electronic transmission
(via E-MAIL, NEWSCOM or WIECK photo database) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   ----
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLEN-ADVENTURE-FINN &LR;  -- For Richard Ford, heading down the
Mississippi River in the same boat with Stanley Crouch was an
opportunity to confront a difficult truth about himself _ and the
limits of thinking in black and white. The Pulitzer Prize-winning
novelist's books include ``The Sportswriter.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLEN-ADVENTURE-SAINT &LR;  -- Walking and giving, walking and
singing, walking and praying: That's what one medieval Italian
roustabout did, and his path over a desolate Umbrian landscape
became a proving ground for sainthood. This author retraces the
steps of St. Francis of Assisi and finds out why he talked to birds
and flowers, and why fish refused to die in his hands and hunted
animals sought refuge at his side. By Gretel Ehrlich, who wrote
``Questions of Heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLEN-ADVENTURE-BRAIN &LR;  -- Brain scans can locate the home of
memory and the land of language. They may eventually help to map
consciousness. This ``traveler'' enters the narrow mouth of a
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) machine at Memorial Sloan Cancer
Center in New York. The scans show 226,000,000 data points in 21
``slices'' of his brain and lead him on a journey to the center of
his mind. By Stephen S. Hall, a contributing science writer for The
New York Times Magazine.

   &UR; The following articles, and 1 piece of art, are available for
purchase as ONE-SHOT features. They are FREE to subscribers to the
Millennium Plus partnership package. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLEN-CARTOON-MACK &LR;  -- ``Overheard at the Explorer's Club,'' a
cartoon by Stan Mack, is a witty, urbane view of the sort of folks
who study the whales of the Galapagos and find mystical qualities
in the gallstones of llamas ... and then gather to talk about it
all in fancy ballrooms with crystal chandeliers and dainty hors
d'oeuvres. (Available in 35mm slide or via electronic transmission)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLEN-ADVENTURE-NIGERIA &LR;  -- Still they come, close to a million
legal immigrants every year, for a new life in America. The first
census, in 1790, counted 3.9 million Americans. Today, with
ceaseless immigration, there are 275 million. For Murphy Popoola, a
Nigerian, to become an American is an escape. But it may also be a
way to return to Nigeria as a citizen of the world. By Roger Cohen,
the Berlin bureau chief of The New York Times and author of
``Hearts Grown Brutal: Sagas of Sarajevo.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLEN-ADVENTURE-YOUTH &LR;  -- It's after college. Do you know where
your young people are? Here are profiles of six youthful wanderers
who, in an era of packaged tours, set out on their own for remote
corners of the globe to find danger, surprise, odd people and very
bizarre food. By Leslie Downer, a London-based writer who
hitchhiked from Greece to India in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLEN-ADVENTURE-TECH &LR;  -- In a wired world, it's time to pull
the plug. Thanks to beepers, cell phones, faxes and Global Village
modems, a traveler simply can't get lost. Here's an idea: Climb
1,300 feet above the Pacific Ocean to a Benedictine hermitage _ a
place where friends and bosses can't reach you _ and where you,
therefore, can reach a deeper self. By Pico Iyer, the author of
``Tropical Classical'' and, coming out this winter, ``The Global
Soul.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLEN-ADVENTURE-CEZANNE &LR;  -- Cezanne worshiped Mounte
Ste.-Victoire as the epitome of Nature at its most sublime. And
Petrarch climbed Mount Ventoux to commune with the gods. But the
author, a decidedly urban traveler, scales the peaks _ and
concludes that mountains, far from sublime, are like glorified
Stairmasters for the upwardly mobile. By Michael Kimmelman, chief
art critic for The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLEN-ADVENTURE-CHINA &LR;  -- Decades before Columbus, Zheng He
sailed from China with 300 ships and 28,000 men. His fleet got as
far as Africa and could have easily reached America, but the
Chinese turned back. What happened? By Nicholas D. Kristof, Tokyo
bureau chief of The New York Times and the author, with Sheryl
WuDunn, of ``China Wakes.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLEN-ADVENTURE-BOOKS &LR;  -- Armchair adventure, anyone? We like
stories of dangerous exploits, tales of high altitudes and deep
water. Adventure novels keep us entertained _ and alive. We love
legends of people who come out alive after terrible experiences.
Beyond mere escapism, travel stories help us discern the limits of
human frailty, prepare for the unexpected and imagine what we'd do
in perilous circumstances. By Annie Proulx, the author, most
recently, of ``Close Range,'' a collection of short stories.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLEN-ADVENTURE-WORDS &LR;  -- The word ``adventurer'' has had a
wild ride through the millennium. Today, to be ``adventuresome'' is
to be bold and daring, to take risks without a connotation of
heedlessness or imprudence. Saunter back a few decades, though, and
``adventurer'' meant a brawler, a plunderer, and even the Devil
himself. By William Safire, the veteran New York Times political
analyst and ``On Language'' columnist for The Times Magazine.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLEN-ADVENTURE-OCEAN &LR;  -- A novelist sent to the bottom of the
sea finds illumination in the darkest of places. His bird's-eye
view is provided by the bubble cockpit of a Johnson-Sea-Link
submersible, a robotic, eerily anthropomorphic, high-tech
contraption with baskets, tentacles and mobile arms. There he can
say hello to angel-fish, deep-sea fireflies and whales about 1,043
feet below the sunny, sparkling waters off Chub Cay in the Bahamas.
By Robert Stone, author of seven books including ``Damascus Gate.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLEN-ADVENTURE-DISASTER &LR;  -- Ever go on a journey that turns
out worse than staying home? Here's a log of low travel points of
the millennium, from the 14th century, when a Moroccan explorer
nearly died from food poisoning, to the 20th century, when a
British climber failed to make it up Nanga Parbat, because he
sneezed. A succinct report on explorers who should have stayed in
bed that day. By John Tierney, a columnist for The New York Times
Magazine.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLEN-ADVENTURE-SAVOY &LR;  -- After discovering lost Incan cities,
Gene Savoy is searching for something truly exotic: the Fountain of
Youth. Savoy, the 72-year-old travel journalist and explorer, is
sailing around the world in a catamaran, with a crew of middle-age
men _ and BBC cameras on board. By Brad Wetzler, a writer for
Outside magazine and a contributing editor for George.

<HEADLINE>
AMERICANS STILL HAVEN'T WARMED UP TO SMART CARDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN BERGER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Visa wants America to like smart cards. So does
MasterCard. So does the government. But America isn't cooperating.
Not yet anyway.
</P>
<P>
   A smart card looks much like a credit card _ the kind with a
black magnetic stripe on the back. Instead of the stripe, however,
smart cards have an embedded computer chip that can store
electronic money and consumer information.
</P>
<P>
   Prevalent in Europe and parts of Asia, the technology has not
caught on in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Magnetic data stripes are a way to store a limited amount of
information on a plastic card, like bank or credit card account
information. A standard stripe holds enough data to provide fairly
secure access to bank accounts or other services. The magnetic
stripe contains an identification code, and the card reader _ such
as a cash register or an ATM machine _ uses that code to retrieve
information about the customer from a central database. The
information is stored on a computer server linked to the
card-reading device.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of a magnetic stripe, smart cards have tiny
microprocessor chips on board, according to Paul Beverly, vice
president of communications for Schlumberger Smart Cards and
Terminals of San Jose, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The chip can be a simple memory storage device, or it can be a
more sophisticated processor. The chips can store relatively vast
amounts of data about their users, so a smart card can be used for
much more complicated tasks. These tasks include holding electronic
money, storing detailed personal health and financial profiles, or
acting as a highly secure key card for access to facilities and
computer networks.
</P>
<P>
   A unit of international conglomerate Schlumberger Ltd.,
Schlumberger Smart Cards is the world's leading manufacturer of
smart card technology, according to Faulkner &AMP; Gray's Card
Technology, an industry trade publication.
</P>
<P>
   The company makes smart cards, readers, development tools and
offers other related products and services. Card Technology says
1.25 billion smart cards were sold in 1998, with a 27 percent
increase expected for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   According to Olivier Piou, another Schlumberger vice president,
the company's sales grew 40 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Schlumberger has installed more than 1 million smart card
terminals in 60 countries, including pay phone systems, banking and
point-of-sale terminals, multispace parking equipment and ticket
vending machines. The company has seen a lot of growth in
telecommunications and banking applications, especially in mobile
phone tools.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all this growth, most of the action continues to be
centered in Europe. Schlumberger sells about 60 percent of its
smart cards in Europe; the U.S. market accounts for only about 5
percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, several small-scale efforts to use smart
card technology have begun, however.
</P>
<P>
   In the Health Passport Project, being taken out for a test run
in the Midwest, smart cards are being issued to a test group of
pregnant women, mothers and children who get assistance from public
health programs like Medicaid and welfare. The cards store fairly
detailed health records for their owners and can transfer that
information to a central database.
</P>
<P>
   A trial program that concluded late last year _ in which
Schlumberger, other card manufacturers and several major credit
card companies took part _ tried to excite consumers and merchants
about using smart cards for commerce, but problems with card
readers and consumer indifference took a toll on the year-long
trial.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of the program, about 600 merchants accepted
free smart card readers for use in their establishments. By the
time the program ended, though, only 200 merchants were still
participating.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has also mandated the use of smart
cards for employees to access federal buildings and its computer
networks. The cards can provide portable profiles of network users,
who can easily access files and sign onto networks without having
to enter a password.
</P>
<P>
   Spyrus Inc. of Santa Clara, Calif., has provided smart card
technology for that program, according to Bob Davis, vice president
of marketing. Spyrus makes hardware and software in systems for
encryption and secure identification, Davis said. The privately
held company had sales of about $20 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically, the smart card market has been much more active
in Europe and the Pacific Rim,'' Davis said, but the product is
starting to spread in the United States, especially for
identification and authentication uses.
</P>
<P>
   Schlumberger also has deals in the works with major banks and
hopes to announce new partnerships before the end of the year,
Beverly said.

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Billed as ``a television journey that may save a
life,'' an hourlong documentary, ``Prostate Cancer: A Journey of
Hope,'' will air at 9 p.m. Friday on KCET (Channel 28).
</P>
<P>
   Narrated by retired Army Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf, himself a
prostate cancer survivor, the show follows several men, their
families and their doctors through their diagnosis and battle with
the disease. The stories explore everything from traditional
treatment options _ surgery, radiation and chemotherapy _ to
experimental immunotherapies such as vaccines and antibody-based
treatments.
</P>
<P>
   The message of the show, a joint project of the Cancer Research
Institute and the American Cancer Society, is simple: Testing is
painless and can detect a deadly cancer that may show no symptoms
until it's inoperable.
</P>
<P>
   Prostate cancer detected early usually is curable.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a rare disease, either. According to the CRI, 179,000
American men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer this year, and
almost 37,000 of them will die by the end of the year. One in five
men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer during his lifetime, and
African-American men are twice as likely as white men to suffer
from the disease. But, when diagnosed and treated, more than 90
percent of men with prostate cancer survive at least five more
years.
</P>
<P>
   The CRI recommends that PSA (prostate-specific antigen) and
digital rectal examinations be conducted annually, beginning at age
50, to men expected to live at least another 10 years and to
younger men who are in high-risk groups, including
African-Americans and men with a family history of prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   A toll-free phone number shown at the end of the program _ (800)
227-2345 _ is connected to an American Cancer Society hot line
viewers can call to request free publications on prostate cancer.

   &UR; HEALTH &AMP; FITNESS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) _ Falls among older people and the
resulting injuries that can cause long-term disability and even
death are rising in epidemic fashion. In a study published last
month in the Journal of the American Medical Association, Finnish
researchers documented an alarming increase in the number and
incidence of falls sustained by people over 50 since 1970. By Jane

   SCI-SPERM-SUPPLEMENT (Undated) _ With a bit of fanfare but
limited hard evidence, a Maryland pharmaceutical company has begun
marketing a dietary supplement said to improve sperm quality to
couples having trouble conceiving. By Eric Nagourney.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-EXERTION-SYNDROME (Undated) _ Chronic exertional compartment
syndrome, a problem that most frequently occurs in the legs of
runners and soccer players, is growing, particularly among women
who in greater numbers are becoming athletes. But the condition is
also frequently misdiagnosed as shin splints. A new procedure now
is alleviating the pain. By Janis Graham.

<P>
   &UR; STANDARD FEATURES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SCI-PRINCETON-FUSION (Undated) _ In its heyday the Princeton
Plasma Physics Laboratory was a palace among physics laboratories,
with an enviably fat budget, ample support staff and the prestige
that comes to research institutions working at the cutting edge in
solving global problems. But today, it is still a leader in
hydrogen fusion research and is so short of cash that it can no
longer afford even a receptionist. But that may be changing.
Specialists in the field are banding together in the hope that
progress toward the elusive goal of harnessing thermonuclear
fusion, the process that drives the sun and hydrogen bombs, to
produce unlimited energy on Earth, will soon regain momentum. By
Malcolm W. Browne.

   SCI-FUSION-HARDWARE (Undated) _ Scientists have developed a
variety of devices and systems in which they hope to be able to
compress hydrogen to the densities and temperatures needed to
sustain thermonuclear fusion reactions. A run down of seven
devices. By Malcolm W. Browne.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-FREE-HEROIN-PROGRAM (Undated) _ Taking a bold approach to
drug addiction, researchers at Columbia University are offering
free heroin to addicts and paying them to use it under a federally
authorized program aimed at finding a cure for their addictions.
Two trials involving heroin injections are among six related
drug-addiction studies being conducted at Columbia's College of
Physicians and Surgeons, all of which focus on the role existing
medications can play in defeating drug addictions. By Christopher
S. Wren.

</P>
<P>
   SCI-INTERNET-RESEARCH (Washington) _ The director of the
National Institutes of Health has touched off a passionate debate
by proposing that scientists disclose and disseminate on the
Internet the results of biomedical research, so the full text of
their reports would be available at no cost to anyone with a
computer anywhere in the world. By Robert Pear.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-TUMOR-DRILL (Undated) _ A delicate but destructive machine,
a kind of molecular power drill deployed by tumors to punch their
way through the body's compartments, has been visualized for the
first time by biologists at Sweden's Karolinska Institute. The
power drill exists not for the benefit of tumors, though they
exploit it, but for normal remodeling of the tough walls that
surrounds the body's main organs and tissues. By Nicholas Wade.
</P>
<P>
   With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-FINCH-FEEDBACK (Undated) _ Among songbirds, the zebra finch
is a one-hit wonder. It learns a tune in its youth, and then is
condemned to repeat it forever, like an aging pop star on the
oldies circuit. A young zebra finch learns through auditory
feedback, listening to its own sounds and comparing them to a song
in its head until it gets it right. Little has been known about how
a mature finch, a ``closed learner'' (compared to a canary, for
example, which learns new tunes all the time) maintains its song.
But recent studies with deafened adult finches have suggested that
they use feedback as well. By Henry Fountain.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-NASA-STARGAZING (Undated) _ In speeches to astronomical
meetings in Chicago last week, NASA Administrator Dan Goldin
announced that he would apply the ``cheaper, faster, better''
philosophy that has revitalized planetary exploration to deeper
studies of the origin and structure of the universe, and challenged
the stargazing community to dream up innovative bold ideas. By John
Noble Wilford.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-OBSERVATORY (Undated) _ Items on turbocharged lizards, an
explanation for the extensive damage of Hurricane Mitch and
wind-borne pollution. By Henry Fountain.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-STEM-CELLS (Undated) _ A researcher has injected neural stem
cells into the brains of fetal monkeys and found that the stem
cells spread out and evolved into the right kinds of tissue in
various parts of the brain. This is the scenario that stem cell
researchers who envision using these pliable cells to replace
damaged organs have been hoping for. The results are not directly
applicable to humans, since the monkeys were still in a fetal
stage, but they allow the researchers to study how the stem cells
migrate around in the brain and evolve. By Nicholas Wade.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-ESSAY (Undated) _ Medical science can measure most things
these days, but one quantity remains eternally, enragingly
imprecise: how long doctors should take to do their work. The
single feat dangling permanently out of reach of the biomedical
revolution seems to be how to make the whole magnificent enterprise
run on time. By Abigail Zuger.
</P>
<P>
   SCIENCE-Q&AMP;A (Undated) _ What is the beta that beta blockers
block?

BALKAN TALKS COLLAPSE AND NATO STEPS UP BOMBING
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KURT PITZER AND DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUMANOVO, Macedonia _ Talks on ending the Balkan war collapsed
overnight, and NATO officials vowed an immediate intensification of
the air attacks on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav delegation ``presented a proposal that would not
guarantee the safe return of all the refugees, or the full
withdrawal of the Yugoslav forces,'' Lieutenant General Sir Michael
Jackson, commander of NATO troops in Macedonia, said early Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO therefore has no alternative,'' he added, ``than to
continue and indeed intensify the air campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday &UR;  &LR; night, NATO B-52 bombers struck at Yugoslav Army
positions in a Kosovo region near the Albanian border where both
NATO and Yugoslav sources reported heavy fighting between Serb and
ethnic Albanian forces. The bombing continued and early Monday,
according to various reports, and concentrated on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Air raid sirens sounded in Belgrade, the capital, and Pancevo
and Novi Sad to the north early Monday.
</P>
<P>
   NATO jets also hit western Kosovo late Sunday, firing 30
missiles at targets there over 35 minutes, the state-run Tanjug
news agency reported. Several missiles fell on Mount Pastrik, along
the border with Albania, and one struck the district Grmija in the
provincial capital, Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   Talks between NATO and Yugoslav military commanders on Kosovo's
border with Macedonia broke down as Belgrade's delegation failed to
return on time after a break from the 10-hour marathon session.
Before the breakdown in talks, NATO said it would not continue the
discussions for a third day.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav officials reportedly held out on signing a six-page
document that would stipulate the withdrawal of 40,000 Serb
soldiers and police from Kosovo within seven days. The Yugoslavs
said that they needed at least two weeks to complete the pullout,
and that there were not enough guarantees that they would not be
attacked by rebels from the Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials said the Serbs were simply stalling for time. The
talks, initially expected to end on Saturday, became more strained
as they stretched into a second day.
</P>
<P>
   While NATO insisted that the talks were not negotiations but
simply a case of their putting to Yugoslav Army officers the
timetables and routes under which Serb forces would pull out of
Kosovo, the Serbs insisted that they needed to consult with their
political masters in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials had expected the discussions to be wrapped up
Saturday, with Yugoslav generals reading and signing a ``military
technical agreement'' that lays out what Yugoslav Army and police
forces must do to end NATO's air campaign. But after nearly six
hours, they ended inconclusively and resumed Sunday morning at an
air base run by French NATO forces in Kumanovo, just northwest of
Skopje, the Macedonian capital.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, commander of the 16,000 NATO troops in Macedonia who
are poised to enter Kosovo as peacekeepers, met Sunday with
Yugoslav generals Svetozar Marjanovic and Blagoje Kovacevic in a
tented hangar at the French base to hammer out details of the
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   After the pause was announced, the representative of the Italian
forces, Colonel Carmine de Pascale, emerged, visibly irritated.
``Very big problems have been created by the Serbs,'' he said
without elaborating, ``and they can only be solved'' by Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Russian Lieutenant General Yevgeny Barmianchev, military attache
at the Russian Embassy here, attended Sunday's meeting as an
observer, apparently to reassure the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians are the Serbs' biggest ally, and it was a Russian
envoy, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, who helped broker the deal Milosevic
agreed to last week.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian news agency Itar-Tass said the main snag concerned
the entry of peacekeepers into Kosovo. The agency said NATO had
been insisting Serbs begin withdrawing within 24 hours, at which
time NATO forces from Macedonia would begin entering Kosovo. The
agency said Russia was arguing that a peacekeeping operation could
not begin until the United Nations Security Council approved it.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has insisted all along that the Kosovo crisis should be
handled by the United Nations, not NATO. As part of the peace plan,
the foreign ministers from the seven leading industrial nations and
Russia are to begin drafting a UN Security Council resolution
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution also is expected to set out a command structure
for the peacekeepers. Russia has agreed to contribute troops for
Kosovo, but insists they will not be under NATO command.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has ruled out a separate command for any Russian force,
which may number up to 10,000 men.
</P>
<P>
   ``A very difficult step toward peace has been taken, but many
issues are still being resolved purely on NATO's terms,'' Russian
Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   In an earlier sign that the peace plan was in serious jeopardy,
the chief architect of the deal, Finnish President Martti
Ahtisaari, postponed a visit to Beijing to discuss it with Chinese
leaders. China, like Russia, is a permanent member of the UN
Security Council and can veto any resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, NATO flew just about 400 sorties, less than the 600 to
700 they had been averaging for the previous two weeks, and most of
them focused in Kosovo, giving the Yugoslav capital a fourth
consecutive day without bombings.
</P>
<P>
   In Brussels, NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said Serb forces were
looting areas in Pristina and in the town of Prizren, to the west.
He said that if looters are spotted during a Serb withdrawal ``they
will be subject to NATO air operations.''
</P>
<P>
   Shea said NATO's refusal to call off its airstrikes until it
could verify a Serb withdrawal was being vindicated by the Serb
stalling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't come this far to stumble at the final hurdle,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   With the talks collapsing, the fighting on the border of Kosovo
and Albania showed no sign of abating. Russian NTV television
showed footage of Serb artillery blasting at villages in the
mountainous border area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over 100 heavy shells hit our village Monday,'' one man
identified as a Kosovar Albanian told the station.
</P>
<P>
   In Oslo, the Kosovo Liberation Army's political leader expressed
skepticism that Belgrade would implement the peace plan. The
leader, Hashim Thaci, also asserted that Serb forces had begun
using poison gas against civilians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fighting between Serbian forces'' and the KLA ``continues with
the same intensity as before,'' Thaci said at a news conference.
``The only difference between Sunday and Monday is that they used a
gas that has hurt civilians.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking Sunday on Fox TV, NATO Secretary General Javier Solana
said that if Milosevic ``does not comply with what he has agreed .
. . NATO will be prepared to continue the military action.''
</P>
<P>
   But Solana also expressed optimism that the plan would be
implemented and hundreds of thousands of Kosovo Albanians who have
fled the violence would return home ``by winter.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Cullen of the Globe staff contributed from Belgrade,
Filipov from Moscow, and Pitzer from Kumanovo. Material from
Reuters and the Associated Press also was used.

BRAVES THROW SINKER AT RED SOX 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-BRAVES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ After 19 days in first place, the Red Sox left the
country Sunday afternoon not knowing whether they'd still be there
after clearing customs in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   Their grip on the top spot in the American League East was
loosened by the Atlanta Braves, who have spent the better part of
the decade flaunting their superiority and did so again with a 3-2,
10-inning win in the rubber match of their three-game set before a
sellout crowd of 32,184 at Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Yankees, who have been inhaling Sox dust since
losing two of three on Yawkey Way in mid-May, had a chance
Sunday &UR;  &LR; night to leapfrog the Sox back into first by a half-game.
But the Mets pounded Roger Clemens for seven runs in 2 2/3 innings,
ending his streak of 20 straight wins, in a 7-2 triumph.
</P>
<P>
   Braves catcher Javy Lopez, who already ruined one story line
this weekend when he broke Tom Gordon's save streak Saturday,
Sunday spoiled what could have become the Parable of the Prodigal
Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez, whose ninth-inning, two-out, two-run double down the
third-base line beat Gordon, Sunday delivered a two-out RBI single
to center in the 10th that pinned the loss on Mark Portugal, who
went from starter to full-time father to reborn reliever in six
tumultuous days.
</P>
<P>
   Portugal, pitching for the first time since walking out on the
club a week ago, made his first relief appearance in almost three
years and was in his third inning of work when Walt Weiss opened
the 10th with a single just under the glove of second baseman Jose
Offerman. Bret Boone bunted pinch runner Otis Nixon to second, and
Portugal was lifted for Jim Corsi after issuing an intentional walk
to Chipper Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Corsi retired Brian Jordan on a fly to left, but Lopez, after
fouling off a couple of two-strike pitches, lined a 2-2 pitch to
center to bring home Nixon with the deciding run.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hit it where we weren't,'' Corsi said. ``I threw a lot of
good pitches, but what are you going to do? He hit a slider off the
end of the bat.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves, overmatched by Pedro Martinez in the series opener,
shied away from declaring that their two subsequent late-inning,
one-run wins over the Sox made them overqualified to occupy the
same field as their ex-cousins. Instead, the Braves' clubhouse was
full of opinions that the Sox were worthy of being in the same
high-rent district.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that what they're trying to do here, which is pitch
well and catch the ball, is going to afford them the opportunity to
win a lot of ballgames,'' said Tom Glavine, the Braves' pitcher of
impeccable pedigree (two Cy Young Awards) and the proper birthright
(Billerica) to offer his take on the Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they can continue to get clutch hitting like they've gotten
to put them in first place, then they'll stay there. But if not, I
don't see them going away in terms of contending for a playoff
spot.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Millwood, the unheralded part of the pitching troika that
Atlanta threw at the Sox this weekend (Glavine and Greg Maddux, who
have six Cy Youngs between them, worked the first two games), held
the Sox without a hit until John Valentin led off the seventh by
lining a first-pitch single to left.
</P>
<P>
   Two outs later, Troy O'Leary took advantage of some indecision
by Millwood, who twice shook off Lopez, to hit a home run just to
the right of the 420-foot sign in the triangle, tying the score at
2-2.
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary had the last of the Sox' three hits on the afternoon, a
two-out single in the ninth off Braves reliever Rudy Seanez.
Atlanta closer John Rocker, whose sprint from the bullpen would be
clocked somewhere between Carl Lewis and Wendell Kim, struck out
the side in the 10th for his 12th save.
</P>
<P>
   ``These games could have gone either way _ they came down right
to the wire these last two days,'' said Sox reliever Rheal Cormier,
who replaced starter Pat Rapp in the seventh, when the Braves
scored their second run on two hit batsmen, an intentional walk, a
throwing error by Offerman, and a fielder's choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``They pitched well, we pitched well,'' Cormier said. ``They're
a good team. They're not in first place for nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox, who finished this brief homestand 3-3, taking two out
of three from the Tigers and dropping two of three to the Braves,
play three against the Expos in Montreal, and three in Shea Stadium
against the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's over with now,'' said Portugal, who was speaking of his
own week of flip-flops between spending more time with his kids vs.
staying on board with the Sox. ``Time to get on a bird and go to
Montreal.''
</P>
<P>
   Still with a half-game lead.

<P>
   BOSTON _ Nice week.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Mark Portugal popped his shoulder out of its socket,
gave up six runs in three innings, then cleaned out his locker and
stormed out of the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday he told teammates he was retiring. Wednesday he stayed
home for his first day of retirement after 18 1/2 years in pro
ball, but he hedged on Thursday when he showed up at Pawtucket for
the Sox exhibition game against their Triple A affiliate.
</P>
<P>
   Friday he came out of retirement and out of the starting
rotation. Sunday he was back on the mound, picking up a loss in 2
1/3 innings of pretty good relief against the Atlanta Braves.
</P>
<P>
   As comebacks go, this was something short of Nixon in '68, Elvis
in '69, or Jordan in '95, but Portugal was glad to be back pitching
after his tumultuous week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just good to get back on the field,'' said the
36-year-old righthander. ``When the phone rang in the bullpen I
didn't expect to get the call and I was a little nervous. So it was
just good to go out and feel comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox fans treated him well. He was applauded when he warmed
up in the pen, when he came in to pitch, and even when he was
pulled in the 10th.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's nice,'' he said. ``This has always been a good baseball
city and it's nice to know they can sympathize with some of the
things I've been going through.''
</P>
<P>
   His manager and teammates never revealed his situation, but
Portugal was not embarrassed to admit that he wanted to quit so he
could spend more time with his three children, who live with his
ex-wife. All ballplayers miss a lot of family moments during the
season. Divorced ballplayers can become strangers to their kids.
</P>
<P>
   How could fans be anything but sympathetic? This wasn't Oil Can
Boyd quitting because he didn't make the All-Star team. It wasn't
Bill Lee pouting because the Sox traded one of his friends. It
wasn't Gene Conley drinking 19 beers and buying a ticket to
Jerusalem. Portugal is a divorced dad, who was (at least
temporarily) willing to torch a big salary and a possible
postseason ticket, just to spend more time with his kids. In the
eyes of most fans, this made him something more than just another
journeyman righty.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family is more important than a ballclub,'' he said again
Sunday. ``I've got three children relying on me for a number of
things. Money isn't everything. I've played this game a long time
and made a lot of money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a decision that reflected on myself in an angry,
depressed mood. But we've got a first-place team and I want to be
part of that. For 18 1/2 years, this is an opportunity I've played
for.''
</P>
<P>
   He has pitched in Elizabethton, Wisconsin Rapids, Visalia,
Orlando, Torledo, Portland, Tucson, Minnesota, Houston, San
Francisco, Cincinnati, Philadelphia, and Boston. In all those
places, in all those years, he has pitched exactly one inning of
major league postseason ball _ giving up four runs in one inning
against the Braves when he was with the Reds.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's got a chance to pitch in big games again, but only if
the Sox make the playoffs and only if he stays healthy and
unretired.
</P>
<P>
   Portugal's kids were at the game Sunday. He waved to them as he
came off the mound after getting the Braves out in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   It was good to get back in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last couple of days I've been apprehensive coming to
the park,'' he said. ``And if I wouldn't have pitched today, I
think when we came back from this trip it would have been a little
difficult. But it's nice that the people that support the Red Sox
backed me. From the sound of it, the fans in the stands
understood.''
</P>
<P>
   Portugal surrendered a single to Walt Weiss to start the 10th
and picked up his 87th career loss when Weiss came around to score
on a Javy Lopez single off Jim Corsi. Then he showered, packed, and
flew to Montreal while his kids went home to Providence.
</P>
<P>
   It is the life of a big league ballplayer and it is a darned
good life, but it is not a life without sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   For Portugal, the good news is that Father's Day is June 20 and
the Red Sox will be playing against the Texas Rangers . . . at
home.

INDELIBLE WIN FOR INKSTER 
</HEADLINE>
 WOMEN'S OPEN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM MCCABE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST POINT, Miss. _ To the very end, Juli Inkster stayed on the
attack. If the US Women's Open was ``my tournament to win,'' she
was going to keep a firm hold and not let up, not even with a
five-shot lead on the 72d hole.
</P>
<P>
   So from 163 yards, Inkster rifled her approach shot over water
she probably didn't even see, over a bunker that was not part of
the equation, dead on target at a flag that was not supposed to be
attacked. After nearly knocking down the pin, Inkster took two
putts to complete her smashing knockout of the field in the 54th
renewal of this championship at Old Waverly Golf Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a champion,'' Inkster said to herself as she stood over
that shot in the fairway at 18, and indeed she proved that with a
couple of exclamation points.
</P>
<P>
   Her closing round of 1-under 71 completed a record 16-under 272,
beating the previous best by six shots. Unheralded LPGA Tour
veteran Sherri Turner finished second (71_277) and rising star
Kelli Kuehne (74_279) fell to third with a double bogey at the
18th, but there was only one serious threat to Inkster.
</P>
<P>
   Herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I didn't win,'' said Inkster, who earned $315,000, ``I
would have no one to blame but myself. I didn't sleep very good
(Saturday night), but I just told myself, `I've got to have the
heart to win this thing.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Heart? No question, and with a polished game it has made her one
of the most respected players in women's golf. It's her third win
of the year and her fourth in eight months. It also goes a long way
in erasing bitter memories of 1992 when she squandered a 54-hole
lead and lost a US Women's Open playoff to Patty Sheehan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was devastated for a long time (after 1992),'' said Inkster,
38 and three times a major winner, but never before in this
prestigious tournament. ``But to come back and win today, no one
can take that away from me.''
</P>
<P>
   There really wasn't much chance of taking it away from her,
either, not unless she planned to let go, which she had no
intention of doing. Indeed, Inkster had an answer for everything
her playing partner did on the front side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kelli was just zinging it to the hole, playing great,'' said
Inkster, who merely zinged it herself. When Kuehne, who started the
day 11-under, four shots behind, made a birdie from 12 feet on the
par-5 second, Inkster made hers from 6 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a few too many shots back,'' said Kuehne, at 22 showing
the promise that was predicted of her after US Amateur triumphs in
1995 and '96. ``I was not supposed to win.''
</P>
<P>
   If Kuehne was pointing to fate, she may have a point, because
after her birdie at No. 2, she finished off the front with seven
strong pars, many of them after birdie attempts burned the cup. She
got closer when Inkster bogeyed the par-4 fifth, just her second of
the tournament and her first in 37 holes, but that would be it.
</P>
<P>
   Inkster birdied the par-4 sixth, then made the shot of the
tournament on the par-3 seventh.
</P>
<P>
   ``An all-world bunker shot,'' said Inkster. Her tee shot had
come to rest under soft sand and the devilish lip of a steep
bunker. A fried egg, they call it. A tournament-saver, is what it
was. With bogey or even a double staring her in the face, and
Kuehne lining up a very makeable 15-footer, Inkster remembered
something Meg Mallon had told her. ``Just take a big swing and kind
of quit on it and keep that club face open.''
</P>
<P>
   From a fried egg to a piece of cotton, the ball came out and hit
softly, rolling within inches of the hole. Inkster had her par and
when Kuehne missed another birdie attempt, the lead was still four.
Even when, at the eighth, Inkster hiccuped and missed a putt inside
of 2 feet (``My only bad putt of the week'') for her third and
final bogey of the tournament, the Open had been closed by one of
the game's best front-runners.
</P>
<P>
   ``With how tough the course played today, with the wind and the
greens being harder, there was no way someone was going to shoot
8-under,'' said Inkster, referring to the rounds Kuehne, Lorie
Kane, and Becky Iverson had posted earlier in the week.
</P>
<P>
   She was right, too. There were just 10 sub-par rounds fired, but
nothing lower than 67. Turner, five back at the start, caused a
stir when she holed out a 7-wood at the par-4 11th for eagle, but
even with that drama she was still four back.
</P>
<P>
   Kuehne bogeyed the par-5 10th, Turner followed her eagle with
back-to-back bogeys, and Inkster converted her 19th and final
birdie of the tournament at the 13th hole to reach the
never-before-seen score of 16-under at a US Open.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Mallon (72_281) nor Dottie Pepper (76_285) threatened,
though they both threatened to squeeze the life out of Inkster when
it was all over. Mallon and Pepper stayed by the scoring trailer
off the 18th hole and waited for their friend to finish her victory
waltz over this course in the deep south. When she did, the tears
flowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the pain she's been through,'' said Mallon, the Open
winner in 1991. She was referring to 1992. ``She's riding a great
high. It was meant to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Funny, those were Juli Inkster's sentiments exactly.

LIFE IS GRAND FOR AGASSI 
</HEADLINE>
 OPEN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Gil Reyes, a great boulder of a man who looks as if he
could lift Stade Roland Garros and the 16,000 tennis aficionados
within, as a sort of Atlasian trick, was talking about his pupil,
Andre Agassi.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen him grow more this year than ever before. He can
live with disappointment _ but not regret. That's very good. The
best is when your dreams come together with destiny. That day is
today for Andre.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, at the close of an afternoon strewn with rocks and
pitfalls, enlivened by growls of thunder and downpours while a
menacing bear named Medvedev barred the path, Reyes was proven a
prophet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, it was destiny,'' softly said Agassi, newly crowned
Sunday as King Andre III of France.
</P>
<P>
   When it ended with his unanswerable serve on a fourth match
point, the rehabilitated Agassi _ back from the limbo of a No. 140
world ranking 21 months ago _ had performed an Atlas stunt himself,
lifting the full house to a frenzy of joy and cheering. Their
favorite had come through after all in a resurrective 1-6, 2-6,
6-4, 6-3, 6-4 triumph over Ukrainian Andrei Medvedev that seemed a
crawl up the Hillary Step without oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, but he had expanded a very exclusive club. Fred
Perry, Don Budge, Rod Laver, and Roy Emerson were the only men to
win all four majors, Emerson the most recent entrant 35 years ago.
Nearly blackballed with yellow balls by the Ukrainian, Agassi was
``most welcome,'' said the Grand Slammer of 1938, Budge, over the
phone.
</P>
<P>
   Having won Wimbledon in 1992, the US Open in 1994, and Australia
in 1995, Agassi had struck the last, seemingly lost chord, and
renamed the club the Quintessential Quintet.
</P>
<P>
   But before Agassi and destiny had their day, Reyes, longtime
friend and trainer, who pounded Agassi into a frame of fitness that
he'd never fit before, looked like a lousy prognosticator. Agassi
was playing tennis he would always regret, and his dreams were the
kind of hallucinations that make psychiatrists rich.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very, very scary out there,'' said Agassi, shaking his
bearded, bald head. ``I couldn't move my legs, couldn't breathe. It
was nerves. Absolutely. I was embarrassed. In shock. It was gonna
be a blowout, and Andrei was playing very well. I had flashbacks of
losing the finals in 1990 and 1991, and the feeling I've long held
that I'd never get another chance.''
</P>
<P>
   As Agassi overhit and underhit, punished the net, and lost track
of the court, the first set went in 19 minutes. The second was
decided in about the same time, and he would face a break point
tantamount to match point at 4-4 in the third. Call 911.
</P>
<P>
   Instead destiny may have been calling _ just before Agassi went
altogether catatonic. The jingle was felt on his brow. A raindrop.
Then many more descended from the sky, enough to drive them indoors
to the dressing room for a half-hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so glad it rained,'' said Agassi, who was leading, 1-0,
in the second. ``I was confused. (Coach) Brad Gilbert was there to
give me perspective, reassure me that shot-for-shot I was better. I
just had to get my feet going, get moving, and execute.''
</P>
<P>
   Rain hadn't been his ally in the 1991 finale, a five-set loss to
Jim Courier. Agassi led, 6-3, 3-1, at the first interruption.
Courier adjusted in the dressing room as Agassi did this time.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the second set went awry for him, much as the first,
``at least I knew what was wrong,'' said Agassi. ``I started to
loosen up and execute my shots, and it would pay off later.'' He
cut his mistakes drastically: 26 errors for the first two sets, but
only 25 more for the next three.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi began to make the other Andrei play longer points, and
the ursine 6-foot-4-inch Medvedev (whose name means bear at home)
started missing his grizzly forehand. Still, Medvedev, a citizen of
Kiev, remained deceptively dangerous, sizeable but quick, and kept
blackjacking his way out of trouble spots with a serve that sizzled
for 23 aces and 29 winners.
</P>
<P>
   The new champion's lonely journey of nearly three hours from
disaster to _ well, destiny? _ didn't begin to look hopeful until
the 70-minute mark when he saw his first break points, and took
Medvedev's serve to 2-4 only to lose his own to 4-3, and fall into
that awful break point hole at 4-4.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to try something different,'' said Agassi, who flung
himself at the net for a game-saving volley, and angled a tough
volley to break serve in the next game, earning the third set.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're OK now,'' croaked a suffering Gilbert, who'd been dining
on his own nails. A more appropriate dish would have been Crow Kiev
for those of us who believed Agassi would crush No. 100 Medvedev.
At least until 2:25 had been played and Agassi forged ahead for the
first time _ and for good _ with sparkling retrieves that cost
Medvedev his serve to 2-3.
</P>
<P>
   By then sunshine and blue sky had taken over along with Agassi,
but it would take a ferocious battering of his finest groundies to
dent and finally tip over Medvedev.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't look happy. I look sad,'' said Medvedev, ``because I
wanted to win this badly. But inside I'm smiling because this was
the best day of my life.'' He was back with his lady love, Anke
Huber, after a long separation, and had gone farther than
imaginable for the longest-shot finalist in tourney history. He
again looked like the 18-year-old who'd been a semifinalist and
rose to No. 4 in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   But Agassi looks as never before, taking his ranking up 10
notches to No. 4, and is a fiery factor again after seeming burned
out. ``I believe there's more success left in my game, and that if
I can do it here I can do it in a few other places, a few other
cities,'' he said.

CHARISMATIC GETS ROYAL TREATMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELMONT, N.Y. _ The morning after was still but brilliant. The
atmosphere from the day before, madcap and electric, had been
replaced by a racetrack's usual morning atmosphere of quiet and
peace.
</P>
<P>
   Charismatic was there in stall 17 of Barn 10 at Belmont Park.
Standing. In a few hours more, he was to be vanned down the hill to
the clinic on the backstretch, where three screws would be inserted
into the cannon bone of his left foreleg. His cracked sesamoid
bones were too fragile for any screws; they would heal nature's
way.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Stephen Selway performed a successful 2 1/2-hour surgery on
Charismatic Sunday. He said the injury ``was not the worst of this
kind I've ever seen, but it was a nasty one. He'll be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Back at the barn, from time to time, a stablehand of trainer D.
Wayne Lukas would stop by and pat Charismatic on the head. Gentle
pats, loving pats. ``The barn is pretty shook up,'' said Lukas.
``My job now is keep their spirits up.''
</P>
<P>
   Lukas's wife, the former Laura Pinelli, is a trainer herself,
``and she deals with this all the time,'' said Lukas, ``but she
doesn't handle this part very good.''
</P>
<P>
   Few could. Even the souls whose sensitivities have been chilled
by a lifetime at a racetrack _ where winning, no matter how huge
the win, always is followed by losing, where throroughbreds are
always one step away from tragedy _ had their hearts melt when
Charismatic broke down at the wire of Saturday's 131st Belmont
Stakes and jockey Chris Antley jumped off one-16th of a mile past
the finish and tenderly took Charismatic's left leg in his hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real, pure animal lovers have a lot of trouble with (this
aspect of racing),'' said Lukas about the reality that horses get
hurt or occasionally die while running. On the other hand, said
Lukas, never since one thoroughbred began racing another has so
much veterinary aid been available.
</P>
<P>
   Lukas said Charismatic had shown no sign of soreness, even with
his of five races in a little more than two months. ``This horse
never had an ice boot in his life,'' said Lukas, listing various
remedies for ailing equine joints and bones, ``and never had an
electrolyte jug after a race, which is standard. He never even had
a cold water bandage.'' So there was no sign.
</P>
<P>
   The Belmont grandstand and clubhouse were empty. The day before,
some 85,818 fans had swarmed to the track, the largest crowd ever
at Belmont, either to see a Belmont Stakes or any race, either to
see Secretariat, Ruffian, Affirmed, Forego, or Kelso.
</P>
<P>
   They were there to see a Triple Crown, perhaps, there to see
Charismatic jump from an unwanted claiming horse to greatness. Or
maybe they were there to see Silverbulletday, the filly, take on
the boys. In any case, they were there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't always play out the Hollywood scripts like we'd
want,'' said Lukas. ``Life isn't that way. We can't play it all out
and just have it fall into place. That isn't reality. But we
already played out two great scripts (in the Kentucky Derby and
Preakness, which Charismatic won).''
</P>
<P>
   Cesor Arredondo, a groom in the Lukas stable, had tended to the
horse and also tended to the human broken hearts. He had talked to
Joanne McNamara, Charismatic's exercise rider, ``and she was down
but I just wouldn't let her mope,'' said the groom.
</P>
<P>
   A few yards away, several horse vans were lined up to transport
several of the Belmont runners to Kennedy Airport and back to
Louisville, Ky., their home base. Charismatic had a ticket on that
flight but the colt was remaining there in stall 17 of Barn 10,
waiting for the surgery to begin.
</P>
<P>
   Lukas talked about the injury and the surgery. The cannon bone
is between the knee and the ankle and an injury merely to the
cannon bone would not be totally devastating. Indeed, said Lukas,
he had a horse running in Sunday's seventh race at Belmont, Quaker
Ridge, who'd had screws inserted to repair a virtually identical
fracture.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times, if it wasn't for the (fractured) sesamoid,''
said Lukas, ``horses come right off the operating table and they'll
stand, almost sound. But the sesamoid they won't touch. The
sesamoid is in the back of the ankle; but the sesamoid is a bone
where if you put a screw in it, it's like bad wood and it'll
probably crack where you put the screw in. You can't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Charismatic's racing career, said Lukas, ``definitely is over.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the shock of the Belmont finish, Lukas had been most
cooperative with the media later Saturday evening, even displaying
the X-ray of Charismatic's injury and answering all questions. And
Sunday, Lukas was not distraught, concerned more with boosting the
spirits of his help.
</P>
<P>
   And, in the end, Lukas had even more respect for the Triple
Crown and how injuries, illness, and fate can step in any time, no
matter how talented the horse seeking racing's most elusive
accomplishment. Truly, only the great thoroughbred can take on all
comers three times in five weeks and vanquish all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time you run in the Triple Crown races, you gain more
respect for those few who have won it,'' said Lukas.

REVOLUTION HONE GAME FOR HOME WIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Walter Zenga is a pragmatist. And Zenga was
appalled, even offended, when the Revolution were humiliated by Los
Angeles at Foxboro Stadium last August, on a day when he was being
honored at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   So, when Zenga was offered the job as the Revolution's coach
after that game, he basically pledged that his team would not be
embarrassed at home before supportive audiences. That goal seems to
have been achieved. But until the Revolution took a 2-0 victory
over Chicago Saturday night they had not displayed an ability to
actually win at home.
</P>
<P>
   The Zenga defensive mindset appears to be having a positive
effect. This was the fourth Revolution shutout of the season, the
first step in limiting blowout defeats. Though the team has but 11
points in 11 matches, only 1 point ahead of last year's pace, the
shutout total is double what the Revolution had by August 1998.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in four seasons, the Revolution are forming a
credible identity. Defensive soccer might not have a glamorous
reputation, but it is a practical concept that provides a
foundation on which to build an attack. Even with everyone
supposedly thinking defense, the Revolution surrendered several
chances that mostly were squandered by Chicago striker Ante Razov.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution started the game without two of their best
defenders, Mike Burns and Richard Goulooze. The solution was to
switch to a 3-5-2 formation with Edwin Gorter at sweeper for most
of the match.
</P>
<P>
   Gorter has had a mostly unrewarding experience since being
brought to the Revolution by former coach Thomas Rongen as the
team's midfield leader last year. Gorter, 35, has not consistently
been in position to display his exquisite technical skills and
lethal long-range shooting ability.
</P>
<P>
   Nor will the sweeper position provide the stage to which Gorter
is accustomed. But, like many of his teammates, Gorter might have
to sacrifice some glory for the greater good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am happy that I am not here on a paid vacation anymore,''
Gorter said. ``I don't think I played badly but I know I can play
much better. But it was nice to be out there. It doesn't matter to
me what position I play. I played sweeper for about eight games
last year.''
</P>
<P>
   The other major Revolution change has been the addition of John
Harkes, who has started the last three games after recovering from
a sprained right knee.
</P>
<P>
   Possibly, the Revolution are evolving into a competent,
consistent team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we have a happy, healthier group and we are all fighting
together as a team,'' Gorter said. ``We have chemistry, and that is
the important thing. I really believe we are on the right road now
and the time to confirm it is going to be against Miami.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution will meet Miami next Sunday. In a warmup game,
they will meet CD Santa Clara, the first Azorean team to be
promoted to Portugal's Primeira Division, in an exhibition at 7:30
p.m. Thursday. Santa Clara will hold a press conference at 12:30
p.m. Wednesday at Academica in Fall River and play an exhibition
against the Santa Clara veteran team at 7:30 p.m. Wednesday at
Bishop Connolly High School . . . The Revolution failed to hold the
lead against opponents from May 1 through May 29, but have trailed
for only 14 minutes of their last two games.

   PROVIDENCE _ Two more wins and the Bruins capture the Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Easy now. Before you rush down to Government Center and camp out
at City Hall for the parade, understand that we're talking the
Providence Bruins and the Calder Cup. All went quiet on Causeway
Street a few weeks back. For now, this is the Hub of hockey.
</P>
<P>
   Paced by Cameron Mann's four points, including a hat trick, the
Baby B's rolled to an easy 6-0 win over the Rochester Americans
Sunday &UR;  &LR; night before a crowd of 8,269 at the Civic Center to take a
commanding 2-0 lead in the best-of-seven Calder finals _ the
American Hockey League championship.
</P>
<P>
   The 22-year-old Mann, the 99th pick overall in the '95 draft,
scored the first, fourth, and sixth Bruins goals and assisted on
the second, scored by Antti Laaksonen. Steven King, who scored
twice in the 4-2 Game 1 win Saturday night, also scored for
Providence, along with Landon Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely learned a lot, being up there,'' said Mann,
referring to his 33-game stint in Boston this season, when he at
one point looked as if he might figure prominently in Boston's
offensive plans. ``But I've learned a lot here, too, and it's given
me some confidence in my game.''
</P>
<P>
   John Grahame, now 9-0 at the Civic Center in the postseason,
turned back 27 shots for his first shutout in postseason play. In
the other net, Rochester star Martin Biron was chased midway
through the first period, the Bruins connecting for three goals on
their first four shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy for John,'' said Providence coach Peter Laviolette,
whose club will meet the Amerks again Wednesday night in Rochester,
followed by Game 4 there Friday. ``Martin Biron has gotten a lot of
the spotlight in the AHL this year. It's terrific to see John
Grahame step up to the plate and show what he can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Grahame possibly could make the jump to Boston next season, if
Robbie Tallas, left unprotected in the expansion draft later this
month, is claimed by Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mann now has six goals in eight postseason games this year . . .
Four of Providence's strikes came on the power play, two of those
by Mann . . . Boston president/GM Harry Sinden was in attendance .
. . Wilson now has six goals in eight postseason games and five of
those have come on the power play . . . If the Bruins win the next
two, it will be the first Calder Cup championship to come to
Providence since 1956 . . . The Bruins were without their leading
playoff scorer, Eric Nickulas (8-11_19), who received a game
misconduct in Game 1 for his heavy check on defenseman Alexandre
Boikov. Nickulas was tagged with a five-minute boarding penalty and
the game misconduct, making him ineligible for Game 2. He is
expected to play in Game 3 . . . Boikov, who had to be helped off
the ice after needing some five minutes to shake the cobwebs, did
not suit up Sunday &UR;  &LR; night.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ron and Charlotte Grahame were in attendance, watching their son
tend net. Ron is the former Boston netminder the Bruins traded to
Los Angeles for the Kings' first pick in the '79 draft _ the No. 8
choice the Bruins used to select Ray Bourque. Charlotte Grahame
works in the Colorado Avalanche front office as secretary to Pierre
Lacroix, the club's general manager . . . The last time the Boston
Bruins won back-to-back games in a final playoff round: April 30
and May 2, 1972, on way to dumping the Rangers for what remains
Boston's last Stanley Cup.

REVVED UP CAMBY SETTING PACE FOR KNICKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Larry Johnson always will be the maker of The Shot.
That won't change. But another Larry, the coach of the Indiana
Pacers, believes one of Johnson's teammates made the wild ending
all possible _ Marcus Camby.
</P>
<P>
   In a little more than a month, the former University of
Massachusetts front-liner has gone from being the Knicks' version
of Stan Papi to an indispensable, irreplaceable part in a machine
that won't quit. After the Knicks' win Saturday night, Larry Bird
didn't hesitate when asked about Camby.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marcus was the best player out there,'' the Indiana coach said
matter-of-factly.
</P>
<P>
   He was good. He had 21 points, 11 rebounds, and 2 blocks. He
made two gigantic free throws in the final minute _ and he's not
exactly Mark Price at the line. He was in the middle of everything.
He caused Bill Walton to gush, ``Toronto traded this guy?''
</P>
<P>
   No one was seen carrying `We Want Oakley' signs in the din of
Madison Square Garden after Johnson's improbable 4-point play with
5.7 seconds remaining gave New York a 92-91 victory and a 2-1 lead
over Indiana in the Eastern Conference Finals. Game 4 is Monday
night in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Bird also fingered Camby for what he felt was the game's pivotal
play. Indiana was nursing an 89-84 lead without much luck and
Johnson flung up a trey that didn't have the same luck as some of
his other prayers in the game. As the ball was coming down, three
Pacers watched it as if looking at some astronomical phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   Out of nowhere, Camby swooped in among them, got a hand on the
ball, and got it back for the Knicks, who promptly called timeout.
The Knicks eventually scored on the possession, cutting the deficit
to 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody went after him,'' Bird sneered in disgust. Moments
later, Bird offered another salute to Camby.
</P>
<P>
   ``He scored points and got a lot of rebounds and kept the ball
alive,'' Bird said. ``He had a phenomenal game. That's something we
need from some of our guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Is this the same Marcus Camby widely derided as too soft and too
lazy? The same one who, not by his own choice, came to New York in
a deal for the popular Charles Oakley and then withered on the
bench for much of the season?
</P>
<P>
   Yup, it's one and the same. Camby and Latrell Sprewell have
become the poster boys for the Knicks' astonishing run. They bring
to the table exactly what ousted general manager Ernie Grunfeld
hoped they'd bring: athleticism, quickness, energy, and, of course,
talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I wanted all year long was to get in the game and prove
myself,'' said Camby, who's averaging 10.7 points and 9.3 rebounds
against Indiana. ``I never lost my confidence in the game while
waiting for the opportunity to come and to make the best of the
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 15 games of the season, when coach Jeff Van Gundy
finally woke up and gave him the opportunity, Camby averaged 10.3
points, 5.8 rebounds, and 1.7 blocks in 25 minutes. He shot 58
percent from the field. He was huge in what many Knicks watchers
consider to be the biggest game of the regular season, a big
comeback win at Miami April 23. The next night, he blocked seven
shots in a huge win at Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   He was everywhere in Game 3, a performance he said was the best
game he had played as a Knick. (Frankly, there wasn't much
competition. His season high was 22 points in a meaningless season
finale against Miami.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I had other games in my career, but definitely, this was
probably my best game in a while, especially for a game so
important,'' he said. ``But it's not over. I want to go out there
and win a championship.''
</P>
<P>
   He's going to be getting more chances as this series progresses.
Van Gundy, who was reluctant to embrace Camby for a number of
reasons, started him in the second half. It was both a signal that
Camby deserved to be out there as well as a necessity; the Pacers
were using Chris Mullin to guard Chris Dudley and were getting away
with it.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Camby starts Monday night is incidental. The Knicks need
his energy every time he's on the floor. Undoubtedly Bird will
challenge the Davis boys to start getting physical with Camby, who
isn't known as a banger. But they also will have to deal with his
quickness and his size, a combination that made him so appealing in
the first place.
</P>
<P>
   That's why he's here. New Yorkers are only beginning to see what
many _ including Camby _ believe has been there all along.

MILLWOOD SHAKES OFF LOST OPPORTUNITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARVIN PAVE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Kevin Millwood didn't pitch a perfect game, a
no-hitter, or a shutout.
</P>
<P>
   And despite allowing just two runs and two hits in eight
innings, the Braves starter didn't even get a win Sunday at Fenway
Park.
</P>
<P>
   But Millwood, according to Atlanta pitching coach Leo Mazzone,
did what he does best against the Red Sox, who succumbed in 10
innings, 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Kevin always seems to do, no matter what the score, when
he comes out of the ballgame, we're in it,'' said Mazzone. ``In the
last year and a half that he's pitched here, he'll give up some
runs here and there, but he's always pitching according to the
scoreboard.''
</P>
<P>
   Millwood, who threw only 96 pitches, left the game tied at 2-2
after inducing John Valentin _ who had ended his no-hit bid an
inning earlier with a single to left _ to pop out with two runners
on in the Red Sox eighth.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's basically a fastball pitcher and he throws a very heavy
ball,'' said Mazzone. ``When you play catch with him, it's like
catching a cement block. I think he's learned a lot from Glavine,
Smoltz and Maddux. He's watched how they go about their business
and he's taken advantage of that, how they approach the game and
get people out.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's really improved his thought process on situational
pitches and location. He's a learner. He's not intimidated. He's a
country boy from North Carolina who wants to play a little
hardball.''
</P>
<P>
   But Millwood, who once went 8 2/3 innings for the Braves' Triple
A farm team in Richmond before losing a no-hitter, relied on his
fastball one too many times when he gave up a game-tying, two-run,
422-foot shot to Troy O'Leary in the seventh, prompting manager
Bobby Cox to remark with a grin, ``At least it wasn't a cheapie.''
</P>
<P>
   Braves catcher Javy Lopez, who had the winning hit against the
Red Sox on successive days, wasn't quite as flippant. ``One
mistake,'' lamented Lopez, who was shaken off by Millwood before
the home run pitch ``cost him the whole game.''
</P>
<P>
   Until he became quite human in the seventh, Millwood, whose
perfect game ended with a fifth-inning walk to O'Leary, thought he
had a good chance to pitch his first no-hitter at any pro level.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I had a real shot at it,'' he said. ``If I just go
out there and make my pitches, there's a good chance it'll happen.
That's the longest I've been with a no-hitter, but I'd have been
happy with one hit and no runs _ and that didn't happen either.''
</P>
<P>
   Millwood said he has two breaking balls, ``and if I could have
gotten one of them over, I could have gotten the win.''
</P>
<P>
   But with his heavy fastball working and his curveball not very
sharp, Millwood shook off Lopez, stepped off the rubber, and
reloaded with his favorite pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to throw a fastball in and (Lopez) wouldn't call
it,'' said Millwood. ``It's my responsibility to throw what I want
to throw and if something bad happens, then it falls on me.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, O'Leary deposited the ball to the right of the
center-field triangle, and what fell on Millwood's shoulders after
that was keeping Atlanta from losing the game and the series to the
Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I whine and pout about the home run, then I'm not going to
do myself or my team any good,'' he said. ``I wanted to throw the
fastball inside even if it wasn't a strike. I just got it out over
the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   Millwood responded to adversity by shutting down the Red Sox in
the eighth, escaping from that little jam by getting his revenge
against Valentin.
</P>
<P>
   ``They hit a couple of line drives earlier and when they go
right at people (right field and second base), you start thinking,
hey, he's got a shot at this thing here,'' said Mazzone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he was going to throw a no-hitter, then I thought he
was going to throw a shutout because his pitch count was way down,
but unfortunately he pitched a great game and didn't get either
one.''

A WIN AND A SAVE FOR WOODS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE CONCANNON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN, Ohio _ Just when it appeared Tiger Woods might surrender
the lead in Sunday's final round of the 24th Memorial at Muirfield
GC, after a potentially destructive shot out of the rough on the
14th hole never made it to the green, he holed his next shot out of
the wiry rough to save par and maintain the lead he'd held for the
better part of three days.
</P>
<P>
   Playing alongside PGA champion Vijay Singh, Woods saved par out
of a back trap on the 16th, and when Singh failed to make a birdie
putt on the 17th, it was a gentle walk to the clubhouse. Woods, who
nearly missed the cut in this tournament two years ago when he was
the game's main story, put it away.
</P>
<P>
   The final numbers were 15-under-par 273 (68-66-70-69) and gave
Woods a two-shot victory over Singh, who took a bogey on the 72d
hole and finished 69_275. Following Woods's similar run to victory
over a strong international field in the DeutscheBank Open two
weeks ago in Heidelburg, Germany, it serves as a suitable entree to
the 99th US Open in two weeks in Pinehurst, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   There were no other contenders in the tournament created by Jack
Nicklaus in the booming suburbs of his hometown of Columbus until
world No. 1 David Duval shot himself into it with an eagle on the
seventh. But Duval could not get closer and finished 70_279 to end
up in a tie for third with Olin Browne, who had the day's best
round (65), and Paraguay's Carlos Franco, who birdied the 17th to
set up a 68.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, who is just 23, claimed his ninth victory on the PGA Tour
and joined Duval as the only multiple winners this year. Woods also
has four seconds, five thirds, and 35 Top 10s since turning
professional Aug. 26, 1996. Only Horton Smith had won more
tournaments at that age. As Nicklaus noted, ``He has the ability to
do things nobody else can do.'' It isn't just the length of his
shots, it's course management and short game finesse.
</P>
<P>
   There also was some restructuring of his game with teaching guru
Butch Harmon. ``I'm making these changes,'' he said, ``and it's
just a matter of being patient with them. People were saying, `Oh,
geez, you're not winning.' The changes I was making in my game were
going to be beneficial down the long haul. I just had to be
patient. I'm starting to understand how to play the game a little
bit better than I had before.''
</P>
<P>
   This virtually became match play on the second nine. Singh
surged into the picture with birdies on the 11th (2 iron, 15 feet,
two putts) and 12th (8 iron, 5 feet), but Woods responded by
draining a 15-footer on the 12th. After flubbing his first shot out
of the rough on the 14th, Woods made the shot of the tournament and
saw it go in the hole. After that, he got up and down out of a sand
trap on the 16th.
</P>
<P>
   Singh, who won the PGA Championship at Sahalee in Redmond,
Wash., last August and said major titles are on his mind, saw his
chances diminish when he went into a bunker on the 14th, just found
the fringe on his second shot, and watched his chip end up 6 feet
from the pin. He missed his saving putt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always loved the challenge of chipping and putting or
scrambling,'' said Woods. The 14th? ``After I flubbed the first
one,'' he said, ``the second one was sitting perfect. It was
sitting up, and it was a shot I knew I could spin it and it would
stop. The only problem was it so fast right-to-left and down the
slope. I thought, `Hmm, that has potential.' It went in.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Woods, who did a serious dance around the green and was
still in front by two, played it out with a matching birdie on the
15th, two pars, and a bogey out of a bunker on the 18th.
</P>
<P>
   The last words should be left to Nicklaus, who will be the
honoree at next year's 25th Memorial in the millennium year and the
year of his 60th birthday. ``Most players at 23 don't have the
imagination he does,'' said the host. ``As far as he hits it,
there's no reason to practice his short game. But he has, and
that's why he's winning and why he's there all the time. He's a
full package.''

   PHILADELPHIA _ Maybe it was high tech- nology gone awry, or
maybe it was just a human misstep. But when Marty Jemison's foot
slipped off his bike pedal yesterday, just 200 yards from the
finish, his shot at victory slipped, too.
</P>
<P>
   Jakob Piil of Denmark dashed past Jemison to dart over the line
first and win the 156-mile USPRO Championships in 6 hours 4 minutes
44 seconds, earning $33,500. He was just ahead of Brian Walton of
Canada, Harm Jansen of the Netherlands, and Morten Sonne of
Denmark, who all were given the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Jemison, 34, cruised in three seconds later. But even though he
didn't take first place, he still received honors as first American
finisher and national champion. He was awarded the stars and
stripes jersey, which will stay in the family when he rides in the
Tour de France next month, since Postal Service teammate George
Hincapie won it last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, this feels good,'' said Jemison, who was national amateur
champion in 1993. And he mat- ter-of-factly explained his misstep
that came just when he was ready to sprint to the finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I dropped back a little bit and was going to give it 100
percent go, and felt like I could have won the sprint, but I pulled
my right foot out of my pedal,'' said Jemison, who later added ``it
was a malfunction of the pedal.'' (On racing bikes like Jemison's
the bike shoe clips into the pedal.) Ei- ther way, his opponents
took advantage of it.
</P>
<P>
   For four hours the 131 racers looked like they were on a Sunday
ride along the banks of the Schuylkill River; for two hours they
looked like  &UR; -------------------- &LR;  they were rushing home to
dinner, and for half an hour they seemed to be racing from a
burning building. More then 700,000 spectators lined the streets to
watch the racing that started at 9 a.m. and made 10 main laps of
the 14.4-mile loop around the downtown.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the race is so long, it's on the last three laps when you
have to pay real attention,'' said Piil, who won last Tuesday's
91-mile circuit race in Lancaster, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Finishing less than a minute behind Jemison was Fred Rodriguez
of Piedmont, Calif., who now rides for the Italian Mapei team. He
had closed the gap on the five leaders to 25 seconds as the race
made its three final laps.
</P>
<P>
   But he was riding alone, and didn't want to use all his energy
chasing the leaders, he said. ``And they saw me coming and sped
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Petra Rossner of Germany defended her title in the women's
72-mile race as she won a sprint finish in 3 hours 1 minute 23
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Rossner, who also won the race in 1996, said she looks forward
to it, not just because she likes the course, but because she likes
the fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really not a climber, but the crowd is so great ... they
just pull me up,'' she said. The course was lined with spectators
ringing cow-H bells, waving signs, and spraying water in the 84-
degree heat.
</P>
<P>
   As the riders made their way down the climb, the pack tried to
even out the race and beat Rossner to the finish.
</P>
<P>
   But the sprinter dashed in front and raised her hands in

German Hanka Kupfernagel _ currently the top women's road racer _
was third.

JONES EFFORT CUT JOHNSON, TRAINER TO QUICK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BILOXI, Miss. _ Next to his fighter, Don Turner had the most
frustrating vantage point of all at the Mississippi Coast Coliseum
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   From the corner of International Boxing Federation light
heavyweight champion Reggie Johnson, the veteran trainer could see,
round after round, openings in which to attack Roy Jones. He would
watch the World Boxing Association-World Boxing Council titleholder
make fundamental errors, his feet spread too wide, his hands too
low, his chin tipped forward ahead of his fists, ready to be
clipped.
</P>
<P>
   Turner would observe these things with a hopeful eye, convey
them to Johnson, and then sit in frustration and learn that they
didn't mean a thing, not even to a competent professional opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roy is the best off-balance fighter I've ever seen,'' Turner
said, the marvel clearly in his voice after Jones (40-1) so
dominated the light heavyweight unification fight that he won every
round on all three judges' cards, 120-106. ``He's extremely fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like Michael Jordan and the other players in the NBA. You
got Roy Jones and the other fighters. I was really surprised at the
difference in hand speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reggie is a very competent fighter. He's probably the next
best light heavyweight in the world, but you can't hit Roy Jones
twice in a row.''
</P>
<P>
   To be accurate, Johnson had ample problems hitting Jones once in
a row. According to CompuBox stats, Johnson threw a total of 380
punches and landed only 49, a less than 13 percent connect rate,
while Jones was drilling him with more than half of his 520
punches, landing 273. But cold numbers could not paint as true a
picture of Jones's dominance over a very fine professional fighter
as well as the expression on Turner's face. It was a combination of
respect, awe, frustration, and wonderment at how one man could be
blessed with such speed.
</P>
<P>
   For Johnson, it was even more frustrating because he was on the
receiving end of so many right-hand leads to the face, a punch that
normally connects only against the most amateurish opposition.
Johnson was knocked flat less than two minutes into the fight by
one such right. That punch was a precursor to his being driven to
the floor again in the third round by a left-right combination that
came so fast many at ringside thought the right had missed until
the replay was shown.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson got up both times because he is exceedingly brave and a
proud professional who plodded on to what he knew would be the
eventual conclusion, always looking to take advantage of Jones's
mistakes yet finding there was nothing he could do with them but
marvel at how meaningless they were.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't offset his speed,'' Johnson (39-6-1) said. ``I
thought maybe I could time him and neutralize his hand speed, but I
couldn't. He does a lot of things wrong, but his hands make up for
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Jones did wrong Saturday night was impossible to
decipher because what he did most of the time was bomb and bang
Johnson to the head and ribs with rapid-fire combinations, a
stinging jab, and rights that traveled from the balcony to
Johnson's face so fast the soon-to-be ex-IBF champion could do
little but resign himself to absorbing them.
</P>
<P>
   Having won the middleweight, super middleweight, and light
heavyweight titles and dominated all his opposition in all three
classes, all that is left for the 30-year-old Jones now is talk of
the ultimate challenge _ moving up to the heavyweight division.
</P>
<P>
   There has been much discussion and debate on that point over the
past year. Jones made Evander Holyfield his target because he is
Jones's size, but the three-time heavyweight champ was at ringside
Saturday night and said after the fight he had no interest in
facing him. The same was true of Holyfield's trainer, who just
happened to be the same man who sat crouched for 12 rounds in
Reggie Johnson's corner wondering when what he saw with his own
eyes was going to have some effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only fight for Evander is Lennox Lewis,'' Turner said.
``Why would he fight Roy Jones?
</P>
<P>
   ``Roy Jones is a great fighter in a weight class that doesn't
have many great fighters. He has more speed than anybody. Too much
speed. But he doesn't punch hard enough to stay with the best
heavyweights.''
</P>
<P>
   What he does have though, is greatness. A greatness proven time
and again during his career. A greatness that is a gift from a
higher power but one he has learned to use to perfection. It was on
display again Saturday night for Reggie Johnson and the man who sat
in his corner to marvel at as they slowly learned to believe their
eyes were lying to them.

MORRISON, MEET CLEAR HURDLES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ As far as hurdlers go, Melissa Morrison is a
tiny thing. Just 5 feet 4 inches and 115 pounds, she feared she
would have trouble with the gusty headwinds Sunday at the Mitchel
Athletic Complex, where the Track and Field Association kicked off
its new professional league with a meet it called the
ProChampionships.
</P>
<P>
   But instead, Morrison came up big, blowing away her competition
to win the 100-meter hurdles in 12.98 seconds and taking home
$100,000 for winning the race, which had been randomly drawn just
days ago as the jackpot event in a new-style meet that offered
appearance fees but no prize money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Invest it,'' answered a gleeful Morrison when asked what she
would do with the bounty. ``And pay off my Visa card and my
mother's Visa card and take her shopping.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Morrison, a promising but little-known 27-year-old fellow
North Carolinian whose career has been up and down, sprinter Marion
Jones was undefeated last season 21 times at 100 meters as she
began her quest for an unprecedented five gold medals _ at 100,
200, the long jump, and 4 x 100 and 4 x 40 relays _ at the 2000
Olympics in Sydney. Although the slowest in at least two seasons,
Jones's 11.33 win Sunday kept the streak alive. Hoping that
upcoming competitors won't hear about the 10-mile per hour
headwind, the reigning world champion seemed pleased, even playful.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are going to look at the time and say, oh, we've got
her now,'' chuckled Jones, who has a personal best of 10.71 and ran
no slower than 11.01 last season. ``Let them think that.''
</P>
<P>
   Other winners included Stacy Dragila, who broke her US record in
the pole vault with a jump of 14 feet, 10 3/4 inches; Obadele
Thompson in the 100 meters (10.29); Maurice Greene in the 200
(20.37); and Regina Jacobs in the 800 (1:59.64).
</P>
<P>
   Whether track and field, languishing as a spectator and
television sport in the US, was a winner remains to be seen,
although everyone connected with the event termed it a good start.
With a crowd generously announced at 3,184, TFA founder Brian
Vandenberg said he was ``thrilled'' with Sunday's shakedown event,
which boasted a two-hour, finals-only format ideal for television.
Between mid-April and mid-June of next year, TFA plans to put on
somewhere between five and eight meets, although locations and
schedule are not expected to be announced until October.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today was just a glimpse of what we're trying to do,'' said
Vandenberg.
</P>
<P>
   As for the athletes, no one was complaining. ``I think it's
great,'' said Bob Kennedy, second in the 3,000 meters to Kenya's
Paul Bitok. ``It's going to get stronger as they publicize it
more.''
</P>
<P>
   Not helping were the withdrawals of headliners and Olympic gold
medalists Michael Johnson after the death of his maternal
grandmother last week and Gail Devers with a nagging hamstring
injury. With them also went two key matchups (Devers and Jones in
the 100; Johnson and Greene in the 200, in which Greene won their
most recent meeting in last year's Prefontaine Classic) that would
have lent the inaugural meet some panache. But the crowd seemed
happy to embrace the lesser-known Morrison in their absence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't realize I had so many relatives living in New York,''
joked Morrison about their eagerness to befriend a big-money
winner.
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging she was a bit nervous entering the race,
knowing $100,000 was at stake, Morrison said she tried to approach
it as any other race. ``I tried not to think about it,'' she said
of the bonus. ``I think I did a pretty good job of blocking it
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Tragically, she has had practice. In March, Morrison lost her
father to cardiac arrest and last June, on the day of the 110-meter
hurdle finals at the US Championships (she finished fourth), her
sister died of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mentally, they are with me always,'' she said. ``I know they
want me to do my best.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, they got their wish.

 CHAMPIONSHIPS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN BICKELHAUPT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Maybe it was high technology gone awry, or maybe
it was just a human misstep. But when Marty Jemison's foot slipped
off his bike pedal Sunday, just 200 yards from the finish, his shot
at victory slipped, too.
</P>
<P>
   Jakob Piil of Denmark dashed past Jemison to dart over the line
first and win the 156-mile USPRO Championships in 6 hours 4 minutes
44 seconds, earning $33,500. He was just ahead of Brian Walton of
Canada, Harm Jansen of the Netherlands, and Morten Sonne of
Denmark, who all were given the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Jemison, 34, cruised in three seconds later. But even though he
didn't take first place, he still received honors as first American
finisher and national champion. He was awarded the stars and
stripes jersey, which will stay in the family when he rides in the
Tour de France next month, since Postal Service teammate George
Hincapie won it last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, this feels good,'' said Jemison, who was national amateur
champion in 1993. And he matter-of-factly explained his misstep
that came just when he was ready to sprint to the finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I dropped back a little bit and was going to give it 100
percent go, and felt like I could have won the sprint, but I pulled
my right foot out of my pedal,'' said Jemison, who later added ``it
was a malfunction of the pedal.'' (On racing bikes like Jemison's
the bike shoe clips into the pedal.) Either way, his opponents took
advantage of it.
</P>
<P>
   For four hours the 131 racers looked like they were on a Sunday
ride along the banks of the Schuylkill River; for two hours they
looked like they were rushing home to dinner, and for half an hour
they seemed to be racing from a burning building. More then 700,000
spectators lined the streets to watch the racing that started at 9
a.m. and made 10 main laps of the 14.4-mile loop around the
downtown.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the race is so long, it's on the last three laps when you
have to pay real attention,'' said Piil, who won last Tuesday's
91-mile circuit race in Lancaster, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Finishing less than a minute behind Jemison was Fred Rodriguez
of Piedmont, Calif., who now rides for the Italian Mapei team. He
had closed the gap on the five leaders to 25 seconds as the race
made its three final laps.
</P>
<P>
   But he was riding alone, and didn't want to use all his energy
chasing the leaders, he said. ``And they saw me coming and sped
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Petra Rossner of Germany defended her title in the women's
72-mile race as she won a sprint finish in 3 hours 1 minute 23
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Rossner, who also won the race in 1996, said she looks forward
to it, not just because she likes the course, but because she likes
the fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really not a climber, but the crowd is so great . . . they
just pull me up,'' she said. The course was lined with spectators
ringing cowbells, waving signs, and spraying water in the 84-degree
heat.
</P>
<P>
   As the riders made their way down the climb, the pack tried to
even out the race and beat Rossner to the finish.
</P>
<P>
   But the sprinter dashed in front and raised her hands in
victory. Karen Dunne of Colorado Springs was given second place and
German Hanka Kupfernagel _ currently the top women's road racer _
was third.

YUGOSLAV DESERTER TELLS OF `CLEANSING' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEKESCSABA, Hungary _ The skin on his gaunt face is stretched so
tight, it makes his green eyes look unnaturally big and perpetually
startled, like a small child's. Five cheap stuffed animals hang
from the wall by his bunk bed at the refugee camp here, giving him
some faint comfort when he is awakened by his frequent nightmares.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't look like a tool of ``ethnic cleansing,'' the
Serb-coined term for the forced removal of a different ethnic
group.
</P>
<P>
   But as a sniper in the Yugoslav Army until February of this
year, that's what Goran says he witnessed and even participated in
when he was on the front lines in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot praise myself. I am just happy that I am alive,''
said Goran, shrugging as he recounted his service in _ and
desertion from _ the army.
</P>
<P>
   On the condition that his real name not be used, Goran, 20,
detailed his life _ as an abandoned baby, a dutiful recruit, and
then a frightened deserter who rode his bicycle hundreds of miles
to cross the border into Hungary, where he has asked for political
asylum.
</P>
<P>
   As a soldier in Kosovo, Goran said, he shot at people from a
trench, and was in missions where Yugoslav soldiers surrounded
villages, attacked them, and then killed anyone who remained.
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers were directed by superiors to steal from the Kosovars,
and to turn the booty in to the army, he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was impossible to independently verify Goran's description of
his military service. However, his account synchronizes with the
stories told by legions of refugees who made it out of Kosovo
alive. Goran's description runs counter to the official Serb claims
that the refugees were escaping NATO bombing, and it suggests that
the activity was indeed an organized effort, and not the random
violence of rogue soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Goran joined the army last year, in part to fulfill his
mandatory military service and in part to give some structure to a
haphazard life.
</P>
<P>
   At 3 months, Goran and his twin brother were dropped into a
garbage can by their mother, who Goran says was an alcoholic. The
brother died; Goran was found by a gypsy woman who was rummaging
around for some food.
</P>
<P>
   He was put into a Yugoslav orphanage and adopted by an old
woman, who died when he was 7. Goran was returned to the orphanage,
and at age 10 found his personal case file on a desk there. Only
when he read his file, Goran said, did he realize that the old
woman who cared for him for seven years was not his biological
mother.
</P>
<P>
   Goran ran away, apprenticing himself to bakers and tire fixers,
who gave him some food and a place to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   When he joined the army, he said, he had heard that Albanian
``terrorists'' were hurting Serb civilians in Kosovo. ``I did not
know at all about the ethnic cleansing before I went to Kosovo,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   He trained to be a sniper at a camp in Subotica, a small city
near the Hungarian border.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on Aug. 1 of last year, the new soldiers were bused past
their normal training camp, and taken directly to a train. They
were loaded onto the cars _ eight soldiers each in 30 cars _ and
guarded by military police who threatened them with court-martial
if they tried to escape.
</P>
<P>
   The train began to move south. Belgrade went by, then Nis.
Terrified, Goran realized they were being taken to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Once there, Goran said, the soldiers were ordered to call home.
``They told us to say we were in Kosovo, there were no problems,
and not to spread any stupid information,'' Goran said.
</P>
<P>
   In the province, Goran was stationed in Suva Reka, Jezerce,
Djakovica, and Stimlje. ``I thought I was going to die,'' he said,
since he was sometimes left without adequate food or ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   Goran said he had been ordered to shoot at three kinds of
uniforms: ``Russian'' uniforms, which he describes as basic
camouflage pattern; white uniforms with Kosovo Liberation Army arm
patches; and black uniforms with many pockets, such as
photographers also wear.
</P>
<P>
   He looks away when asked if he killed anyone. ``I don't know,''
he said. ``I tried to shoot at my targets' legs.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about what happened at the villages, Goran looked down at
the table and took a long drag on his cigarette. ``There was ethnic
cleansing,'' he said, looking up. ``Yes, it happened. Villages were
burned.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started to shoot at the villages from three directions,
leaving only one direction for retreat,'' he said. ``It was a
message that they had to go.''

LOOKIT: THE UNRECOGNIZED ADMONITION LINGERS ON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, June 13)  
(Eds: Items in bold should be set in italics.) 
(lb) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Kennedy Library occasionally releases tapes recorded
secretly by JFK of conversations with other political leaders. In
his San Francisco Examiner column, the hardballing Chris Matthews
reported a familiar but curious locution on one of those
transcripts. It will be semantically examined here for the first
time.
</P>
<P>
   JFK called Mayor Richard Daley of Chicago to complain in salty
language that one of his local representatives was ``sticking it
right up us'' in not supporting him on a civil rights bill. Daley
replied: ``He'll do it. The last time I told him, `Now  &UR; look it &LR; 
... you vote for anything the president wants ... and that's the
way it's gonna be.'''
</P>
<P>
   The tape's transcriber got it wrong. The admonition is one word:
 &UR; lookit &LR; . You won't find  &UR; lookit &LR;  in most dictionaries, though it
is a widely used, if somewhat outdated, urban Americanism, on the
order of  &UR; see here &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Lookit &LR;  began as a corruption of the transitive verb  &UR; look at &LR; ,
as used by Theodore Dreiser in his 1925 novel, ``An American
Tragedy'': ``Oh, do look at those sleeves ....  &UR; Lookit &LR;  the
collar.'' But the intransitive verb has a different meaning. In
Philip Barry's 1939 ``Philadelphia Story,'' the character played by
Cary Grant in the movie says to Katharine Hepburn, `` &UR; Lookit &LR; ,
Tracy, don't you think you've done enough notes for one day?''
</P>
<P>
   In the same way, Mayor Raymond Flynn of Boston told a conference
of mayors in 1991, `` &UR; Lookit &LR; , cities are tired of being portrayed
as, quote, problem areas.'' (Democratic mayors are especially keen
users of  &UR; lookit &LR; .)
</P>
<P>
   The meaning is not ``look at it'' or even ``consider this.'' The
syllable  &UR; -it &LR;  has nothing to do with the word  &UR; it &LR; . The meaning
ranges between the imperative ``pay attention'' and the more severe
``look at me when I'm talking to you'' (perhaps rooted in the
medieval  &UR; look ye &LR; ). The closest one-word synonym is  &UR; listen &LR; ,
punched up by the recent favorite of football coaches,  &UR; listen up! &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Hold still for a further nuance. ( &UR; Lookit &LR; , we're nothing if not
thorough in this column.) I posted a query about this unexamined
Americanism on the American Dialect Society list-server. (I think
 &UR; list-server &LR;  may be a nonsexist word for ``somebody who waits on
lists,'' unless it is ``somebody who hands you a list,'' as in ``My
name is Rodney and I am your  &UR; list-server &LR;  this evening.'')
</P>
<P>
   Dennis R. Preston from the department of linguistics and
languages at Michigan State University, who says he is a
Midwesterner, contributes this contour to the introductory
admonition: ``The tone of  &UR; lookit &LR;  for me is usually exasperated
(` &UR; Lookit &LR; , I've been trying to explain ...') or even aggressive
(` &UR; Lookit &LR; , I got me a knuckle sammich here you gonna hafta munch
if ...').''
</P>
<P>
   M.E.G.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Elizabeth Greenfield _ her initials spelled the acronym
MEG, which became the first name she was known by _ died last month
at 68. The Washington Post editorialist and Newsweek columnist, a
Pulitzer Prize winner and later a Pulitzer board member, was long
an inspiration to every opinionmonger in the nation. She was
suitably eulogized by journalists and political figures for her
incredibly good sense and zero tolerance for hypocrisy and
pomposity.
</P>
<P>
   Because Meg was often a secret source of On Language, a word is
in order here about her love of the political lingo. At a time when
Washington colloquies were endangered by an outbreak of
 &UR; watershed &LR; , she drew a bead on that vogue word and effectively
blasted it out of the shallow water of pretentious discourse.
</P>
<P>
   When, in 1968, Newsweek compounded the cliche with ``a
 &UR; watershed &LR;  in the quagmire,'' she responded with, ``I have become
an incurable, even obsessive collector of printed  &UR; watersheds &LR; , of
which I believe I now have the best collection in town _
 &UR; watersheds &LR;  perching on escalation ladders,  &UR; watersheds &LR;  embedded
in arms spirals,  &UR; watersheds &LR;  wrapped (like chicken livers,
perhaps) in an enigma. It is not, however, an expression I would
dare to use myself. I came to that drainage basin two years ago and
paddled left, into the sunset.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a turning point. She did the same thing to  &UR; virtually &LR; ,
the cop-out modifier, and to  &UR; crossroads &LR; , the pothole in the path
of every headline writer. Miss Greenfield (no Ms. for Meg) insisted
that words be used to transmit clear meaning, and rejected those
that confused the reader or diffused her focus.
</P>
<P>
   We shared a taste for arcane puns. A generation ago, in an
article about the Palestine Liberation Organization and its leader,
I used the title ``That's My Baby,'' and wondered if someone,
somewhere would catch the dim allusion. Silence for a day. Then in
came the call from Meg, singing in her sweetly rasping voice:
``Yasser, that's my baby. No sir, don't mean maybe.''
</P>
<P>
   It pained Meg not to be outrageous enough to do the same above
her editorials. Though she may have been the first to consider
``Between Iraq and a Hard Place'' in a headline, she felt that the
dignity of her editorial page would not permit really deep
groaners.
</P>
<P>
   When her deputy Stephen Rosenfeld addressed a difficulty being
faced in a Latin American republic, she called me to pass along his
rhyming bilingual encapsulation: ``Tsoris in Honduras.'' (She
called again to object to my spelling of the Yiddish word for
``trouble''; her version is  &UR; tsouris &LR; , closer to Honduras.)
</P>
<P>
   And when Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh was arrested for some
wrongdoing, Meg had the forgiving headline in type but could not
bring herself to run it. So she passed it on to me: ``Let Bhagwans
Be Bhagwans.''
</P>
<P>
   Those of us in the world of words knew the little lady of
towering stature to be serious and funny, astringent and wise. She
leaves a void.

PLAYING INTO MILOSOVIC'S HANDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELIZABETH NEUFFER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Don't think a peace deal means that NATO has won the war.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's abrupt acceptance of
Western peace terms last week should not be read as capitulation.
Even if looks like a worse deal than the Rambouillet plan he
rejected, it is not. If anything, the deal contains many elements
in it that the canny Serbian dictator has wanted all along.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, last week's agreement is stunningly lacking in key
details _ giving Milosevic plenty of wiggle room in negotiations on
what happens next _ and it raises the specter of Kosovo's possible
partition.
</P>
<P>
   Further, it gives Milosevic just what he calculated he needed
months ago: a Western security presence, bringing with it Western
money. Why that need? The emergence of the Kosovo Liberation Army
left him little choice.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since his own forces failed to smash the KLA's spirit _ or
halt Albania's support for them _ Milosevic knew he had a problem
that was not likely to go away. His own forces could never
completely guarantee that the KLA was routed. To ensure that the
KLA is held in check, Milosevic knew what he needed: Western troops
on the ground that would be there to disarm them. Last week's peace
deal will do just that.
</P>
<P>
   But getting his own public to accept such forces was a problem.
And Milosevic had other, equally important things to accomplish
first. Accomplish them, he has.
</P>
<P>
   One aim was to lower the number of Kosovars in the province, who
compromised an uncomfortable 90 percent of the population. While
the peace deal assures that the nearly 1 million Kosovars who fled
can return home, it is unlikely that all will.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, the 75,231 that have left the region for the
United States, Australia, and Israel and other countries already
realize they're on track to a far better life than what they had
back home. Those who've quit the refugee camps for a new life in
Albania may decide they are better staying there, too.
</P>
<P>
   A second objective was to undermine the power of those Kosovars
clamoring for independence or supporting the KLA. It remains
unclear just how many Kosovars have been killed, but among them are
likely to be key community leaders who could have mobilized
followers. And Kosovars who do return are likely to be distracted,
for the time being: They will have to focus on rebuilding their
shattered lives, not agitating for political freedom.
</P>
<P>
   As importantly, Milosevic has consolidated his grip on power in
Serbia. Had he signed the Rambouillet deal, he would have appeared
to have capitulated to the West. Now he looks domestically like a
peacebroker who saved his people from further destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, the NATO bombing campaign, which continued into this week,
helped him strengthen his grip back home by shattering his
opposition. The most loyal proponents of democracy are now bitter
and disenchanted with the West. He has all but destroyed the
independent media. The powers Milosevic assumed during his wartime
state of emergency are likely to remain, ensuring that Serbia
becomes a virtual police state.
</P>
<P>
   Even the outrage expressed by Deputy Prime Minister Vojislav
Seselj _ who has said he will quit _ and his Radical Party plays
into Milosevic's hands. With the threat of extreme nationalists who
could sink the deal, the West will hasten to ensure Milosevic stays
in power, because he can guarantee the peace and keep Seselj under
control. His power, alas, is likely to remain unquestioned and
absolute.
</P>
<P>
   And the fact that Milosevic has embraced the deal has also
guaranteed his impunity, for now. The peace plan notably makes no
mention of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former
Yugoslavia, which indicted Milosevic and his top aides last week.
It remains unclear just how NATO will make good on its promises to
to the tribunal that its investigators would be able to ride in
with the troops.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Russian troops, traditional allies of the Serbs,
will patrol a part of Kosovo also raises the potential for the
province's future partition. Russian troops could choose to patrol
the north, along the Serbian border. That would ensure that
mineral-rich territory, with many of the key Serbian religious
sites, remains in Slavic hands. Kosovo's Serbs will feel
comfortable remaining there.
</P>
<P>
   But Kosovar Albanians may not. They may chose to group wherever
American, British, or other NATO troops patrol, feeling more
comfortable under their oversight.
</P>
<P>
   The net result may be a Serb-dominated north, and a Kosovar
dominated south.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most importantly, last week's peace deal means Milosevic
may have found a way to hang on to power while solving some of his
country's long-term economic problems. One reason Milosevic has
resorted time and again to war over the last decade was because he
knew he could not hold onto power while making the painful
transition from a communist economy to a free-market one.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Western aid is likely to come pouring into the region (with
some of it being skimmed off the top for Milosevic and his
cronies). The money surrounding the 50,000 peacekeepers in the
region alone will go a long way to rejuvenating business. And
someone will have to foot the bill _ or loan Serbia the money _ to
repair the damage done by the NATO bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   All of this is not to say Milosevic didn't make some flawed
calculations over the last few months. He expected the NATO
alliance to fissure earlier, and for less bombing to occur. The
flow of refugees to neighboring countries did not destabilize the
region _ and his neighbors, Albania and Macedonia _ as much as he
would have liked.
</P>
<P>
   But he wisely calculated that NATO would not risk putting in the
ground troops that would sweep him and his regime from power.
Knowing that, he has accepted a deal that may well solve some of
his most pressing domestic problems _ while ensuring he gets what
he wants most: continued power in the Balkans.

IN PARIS, WORKERS RULE THE RAILS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY TYE 
c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Last week's crippling public transit strike here was
partly a case of France's fiery passion for justice.
</P>
<P>
   And partly a bonfire of its vanities.
</P>
<P>
   Rail and bus workers began their walkout Wednesday morning after
hearing that Eric Douet, a fellow worker, had been badly beaten
Tuesday by illegal peddlers at a Metro station in northern Paris.
</P>
<P>
   When word spread that Douet had died, the strike spread across
all of Paris's subway network, a third of its buses, and parts of
suburban rail lines, as well as to transit systems in Marseille and
Lyon, France's second- and third-largest cities.
</P>
<P>
   The effect on Paris was immediate and disabling: nearly 200
miles of traffic jams on roads in and around the city, lines as
long as 50 people at taxi stands, and tens of thousands of
commuters walking, bicycling, roller-skating, and hitchhiking to
work _ or taking the day off.
</P>
<P>
   The timing couldn't have been darker for the City of Light, with
the strike coming just as it was hosting a series of conventions,
and a Grand Slam tennis tournament, that had hotels teeming with
visitors from all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   Still, watching the ``esprit'' that saw transit workers stand by
their comrades, it was difficult not to feel at least grudging
respect _ at least at first.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The cause, after all, was a noble one: ensuring the safety of
public transit workers and passengers. Transit unions responded
with a speed and determination that would be tough to imagine in
the United States, where strikes by public workers usually bring
legal injunctions, and where strikes of any type are tough to mount
and sustain. And the French government, from the prime minister to
the transportation chief, immediately endorsed the need for
enhanced safety at subway stations.
</P>
<P>
   All of which seemed a fitting tribute not only to a tradition of
citizen action tracing back to the French Revolution and the
student protests of the 1960s, but to the memory of the martyred
Metro worker, Douet, whom the Associated Press identified as a
39-year-old father of four.
</P>
<P>
   By Thursday, however, the facts of what really happened to Douet
began to be filled in. And for many, moral outrage began to be
replaced by a sense that, however worthy the cause of subway
safety, powerful trade unions had rushed to judgment on Douet's
death, perhaps to advance a political agenda.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC;
</P>
<P>
   An autopsy Wednesday evening found ``no traces of violence'' on
the Paris ticket inspector, who had in fact died from a ruptured
blood vessel in his brain, according to the local prosecutor's
office. It remains to be determined whether the aneurysm had been
induced by Tuesday's confrontation with vendors illegally selling
goods in the Metro.
</P>
<P>
   To Anne Bunde-Birouste, an American who has lived here for 13
years, last week's strike conjures up the best and worst of France:
``They're very concerned in this country about increasing violence,
and they're ready to make an effort to stop it. . . . But they
don't really care if they inconvenience people because they want to
make that point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course it inconvenienced everyone in my family,'' added
Bunde-Birouste, a program director for an international health
promotion agency. ``I take transport, my employees take it, and my
guest needed to take it and couldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Baron Eric de Rothschild, one of France's leading business and
civic figures, is less sympathetic to the strikers: ``It shows to
the government that if it ever does anything against unions, they
have the power one day or other to stop the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Nicole Kac-Ohana, a rheumatologist in Paris, tried to be
philosophic. This strike and others recently reflect an
unwillingness to attack problems head-on, which characterizes the
French approach to everything from the Kosovo crisis to labor
disputes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They even don't know, they even are not sure, but they're
doing and they're doing in a special way,'' she said of last week's
unannounced strike. That ``special way,'' she added, ``is always
the way to bother people.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Parisians think of the recent work stoppage, they'll
have to put up with at least another half-day of it. Both the bus
and subway systems were expected to be closed Monday afternoon for
three hours so workers can attend Douet's funeral.

WHERE HAVE ALL THE LIBERALS GONE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID SHRIBMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ No passionate offensive against corporate greed. No
hue and cry over the fate of the poor, the sick and the old. No
agony over those left behind as the economy surges ahead. That
great silence you hear out there is the sound of the liberal agenda
for the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly but surely, liberalism has slipped off the American
horizon. None of the presidential aspirants for 2000 are rooted in
even the establishment strain of liberalism. Neither are their
platforms, as they themselves eagerly point out. And while a few
scattered voices of liberalism still cry in the political
wilderness, there is no critical mass calling for a domestic agenda
built on progressive principles.
</P>
<P>
   And so in this atmosphere it is impossible to avoid the thought:
We may be too prosperous for progressivism.
</P>
<P>
   Bad times are a breeding ground for ideology on both the left
and right; the distress of the Great Depression created the
appetite for the New Deal of Franklin Roosevelt, while the high
inflation and unemployment of the late 1970s created the appetite
for the conservative revolution of Ronald Reagan. Neither Roosevelt
nor Reagan would have prospered in a time of great prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe the lesson is that in good times the center holds,''
said Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican who is seeking the
GOP presidential nomination. ``There's general satisfaction among
the electorate and a centrist kind of approach maybe the most
popular.''
</P>
<P>
   But now, in the greatest economic prosperity of the century,
there remain some ideological updrafts on the right; though the
various strains of conservatives are constantly at war,
conservatives are yeasty with ideas and prominent in the public
debate. It's the left where the vacuum is.
</P>
<P>
   ``The liberals are still there, of course, but there are not
many of them remaining in major political positions in the
Democratic Party,'' said Austin Ranney, a political scientist at
the University of California at Berkeley. ``For politicians,
winning is a prerequisite for doing what they want to do, and it
has been clear for a long time that New Deal liberalism is no
longer winning material.''
</P>
<P>
   But even during the New Deal itself, the architects of the
biggest burst of liberalism in American history worried that
prosperity might crowd out progressivism.
</P>
<P>
   Roosevelt, who in 1924 had told Democrats that liberalism would
not have its opportunity ``until the Republicans (lead) us into a
serious period of depression and unemployment,'' gave voice to this
fear in 1937, in his second inaugural address. He railed that
``Symptoms of prosperity may become portents of disaster!
Prosperity already tests the persistence of our progressive
purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   Modern prosperity is testing progressives' purpose more than
ever. The two Democratic contenders, Vice President Al Gore of
Tennessee and Bill Bradley, the former US senator from New Jersey,
are both aiming only slightly left-of-center, perhaps a plus for
Democrats committed to winning elections but a danger for Democrats
committed to massive change in the nation's economy and culture.
</P>
<P>
   The principal figure in the party's devotion to the center is
the man who has dominated American political life for nearly seven
years, Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   He watched Democratic stalwarts like former Walter F. Mondale of
Minnesota, Jimmy Carter's vice president, and Michael S. Dukakis of
Massachusetts, the former governor, lean left to win the party
nomination only to find that the very process of becoming the
Democratic standardbearer had made them unappealing to the critical
center, where general elections are won and lost.
</P>
<P>
   A former president of the relentlessly moderate Democratic
Leadership Council, Clinton recognized that the center of gravity
in American politics had shifted to the right at least since
Reagan's election in 1980, and maybe even since Carter's election
in 1976. Though famous for his personal lack of discipline, he
nonetheless showed remarkable political discipline in 1991 and
1992, hewing to the center and positioning himself to defeat
President Bush, and, in 1996, Bob Dole of Kansas, the former US
Senate majority leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``Liberalism dies away in good times,'' Dole said in an
interview. ``As Clinton found, it's possible to stay in the middle
and adopt a lot of Republican things and the liberals have to
accept that.''
</P>
<P>
   The lesson has not been lost on the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   But what has been lost are the voices on the left that
contribute to the American debate even if they do not necessarily
contribute to the victorious coalitions of Democratic presidential
nominees. Indeed, those voices are greatly diminished now, at a
period when the economy's roar drowns out the pleas of the poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to be extremely liberal when the economy's going
well,'' says state Representative Jim Solis of Arlington, Texas,
the Democratic chairman of the House Economic Development
Committee. ``The problem is that we might be leaving some people
behind, and these are the folks _ the working poor _ that we have
to take care of, still.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosperity hasn't always been incompatible with progressivism.
The Great Society occurred during an economic boom, to be sure. But
it was a boom unlike any other, occurring at the height of the Cold
War when there was a sense of social solidarity. It occurred,
moreover, at a time when rich and poor were often interdependent,
producing wealth at factories owned by one group and operated by
the other _ rather than at lone computer terminals that are linked
not to people or products but only to networks and financial
markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was rapid economic growth and a small gap between rich
and poor and we did a lot of things to widen opportunity,'' said
Robert B. Reich, Clinton's first secretary of Labor who now teaches
at Brandeis University's Heller School. ``But now, in another era
of growth and prosperity, we seem unwilling to do these things.''
</P>
<P>
   The stratospheric heights of the Dow Jones Industrial Average
have not wiped out the misery at the depths of American life. The
last few years of the broadly shared prosperity have not been
nearly strong enough to change substantially the standard of living
of many working families. Between 1989 and 1998, the real wages of
the typical male worker have actually dropped by half a percentage
point per year. Since March 1998, when unemployment has been low
and economic growth high, over 400,000 manufacturing jobs have been
lost, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so much good news, but there still are very deep
holes, and this level of prosperity will have to be sustained much
longer than we can reasonably expect it to if we are going to climb
out of these holes,'' said Jared Bernstein, an economist at the
Economic Policy Institute, one of the few remaining redoubts of
liberalism in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Even the growing gap between rich and poor, a traditional
feasting ground for liberals hungry for an issue, has gone largely
ignored. But it is there, providing the largest increases in
inequality since World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Consider this: From 1947 to 1979, each income group in the
national economy grew at about the same rate, about 2.4 percent
annually. In fact, the highest fifth grew at 2.1 percent while the
lowest fifth grew at 2.5 percent. But between 1979 and 1996, the
average income of the bottom fifth declined 0.4 percent per year
while the average income of the top fifth grew 1.5 percent per
year.
</P>
<P>
   But all of this is happening at a time when traditional
liberalism remains discredited and when a new breed of conservative
_ less allergic to government than Reagan, less committed to
bombast than Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker, but still
skeptical of economic prescriptions imposed from above _ is growing
in America, particularly in the cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wealth redistribution programs for 30 years didn't work,''
says one of their leaders, Stephen Goldsmith, the Republican mayor
of Indianapolis. ``They put a slight drag on those with wealth and
they degraded the quality of life of those in the bottom two-fifths
of the population. The success of our economy plus the failures of
the aggressive redistributors put liberalism at a disadvantage.'
</P>
<P>
   Democratic politicians understand those limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you can do in good times is to help the children in
poverty, the people who don't have any health care, and raise the
issue of racial unity,'' said Bradley. ``Good times allow you to
play to people's better angels, and the question is whether the
good times last long enough to make these changes, to move our
collective humanity an inch forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus the great paradox at the heart of American politics today:
If the good times don't last, liberalism may have a second chance.

PRIVACY BILL FOR PATIENTS IS DEBATED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LOUISE D. PALMER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In hospital administrators' suites, insurance
company offices, and in Senate committee chambers, the same debate
rages and the same impasse prevails: how to protect a person's
medical privacy while guaranteeing health care providers needed
information.
</P>
<P>
   The debate, once a theoretical problem, has in the computer age
become a practical one. The wrangle on Capitol Hill proves it has
also become a political problem.
</P>
<P>
   On one side are pharmaceutical companies, medical researchers,
data collectors, and law enforcement agencies which want more and
easier access to patients' records.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side are consumer advocates and civil libertarians
pushing for patients to have more control over their records.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, no federal law guarantees a patient's privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Horror stories abound. A computer disc with the names of
HIV-positive individuals was given to a newspaper. A medical center
inadvertently left thousands of patient records open on the
Internet. Employers fired workers after reading their medical
histories. Psychiatrists were ordered by insurers to turn over
verbatim notes from their sessions with patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ability to ensure the privacy of health records
increasingly is at risk,'' the Congressional Research Service, the
research arm of the Library of Congress, concluded this year.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, a federally appointed panel on vital and health
statistics declared a ``health privacy crisis,'' prompting Congress
to address the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts in the Senate to merge three separate bills on patient
privacy fell apart last month, though negotiations are set to
resume in the Health and Human Services Committee on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``My head hurts from dealing with this issue,'' complained a
Senate aide after dozens of meetings failed to produce agreement on
a compromise proposal being drafted by Senator James M. Jeffords,
Republican of Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   Some argue that Jeffords's bill would be a strong step toward
improving medical privacy. It would establish a framework to grant
individuals ownership over their medical records and the right to
control access to them, with some exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   However, consumer advocates, civil libertarians, and some
medical care providers warn that the exceptions are too broad and
will do more harm than good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm afraid the compromise bill will compromise privacy,'' said
Richard Sobel, a research fellow at the Berkman Center at Harvard
University. ``You can't have just a little bit of privacy
protection.''
</P>
<P>
   One exception would require patients to grant their managed-care
providers and insurers complete access to their records for
``health care operations'' such as billing.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates say the terms are so vague that almost anyone
could open and read patient files. They want to narrow the list of
people with access to records and give individuals the right to
refuse such a blanket authorization, a provision providers reject
outright.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the integrated system we have now it is not possible for
any hospital or health plan to ask consent every time the
information is used,'' said Carol Kelly, speaking on behalf of the
Health Care Alliance, an umbrella group representing business
interests ranging from insurance to pharmaceutical companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is necessary for information to move freely within that
entity and avoid having to ask patients for their signature every
time the information moves,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Another concern relates to a provision Sobel refers to as ``docs
to cops'' that would allow law enforcement personnel, including the
police, to read medical records without having to establish
probable cause or get approval from the courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very important that there be a neutral third party
between those seeking information and those who have it _ someone
like a judge or jury,'' said Patti Goldman, a lobbyist with the
American Hospital Association.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most contentious aspect is whether states would be
allowed to enact more restrictive privacy laws or whether the
federal law would override all state rules.
</P>
<P>
   The Health Care Alliance and the American Hospital Association
want one federal standard that would preempt the patchwork of state
laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``If two states passed two different laws governing patient
information and a hospital was on the state line, the institution
could really be hamstrung on how and when to disclose that
information,'' said Goldman.
</P>
<P>
   Privacy advocates, however, want states to keep existing laws,
and to pass new ones if they provide better protections. They point
to Massachusetts, which might be prohibited under the proposed
measure from passing the strictest medical privacy bill in the
country. The bill is now in the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Edward M. Kennedy said states should be able to insist
on better protections as unforeseen developments arise in such
areas as genetic testing or new epidemics.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, who introduced his own bill, also seeks to forbid
hospitals or insurers from giving private researchers medical
records unless all information identifying a person by name is
removed.
</P>
<P>
   Also remaining to be worked out are the liability terms for
someone who unlawfully shares or exposes an individual's medical
history.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, led by Senator Robert F. Bennett of Utah, insist a
person or entity could be sued only if the information was
``intentionally or willfully'' released, while Democrats, led by
Kennedy, want to lower the standard to allow anyone who suffers a
breach to sue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is crucial for the law to be enforced effectively, and that
means the basic principle that if your rights to privacy are
violated, you can hold someone responsible in court,'' said Chai R.
Feldblum, a Georgetown University law professor who represents
disabled people.
</P>
<P>
   Even if these issues are resolved, Margo Goldberg, a
psychiatrist from the Boston area and a leader of the National
Coalition for Patient Rights, pointed out that the proposed
legislation does not deal with one of the greatest threats to
patient privacy: cradle-to-grave'' electronic medical records that
are just now being developed to follow patients throughout their
lifetimes.

ASIAN AMERICANS LEARN LESSON FROM FUND-SCANDALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYCHE HENDRICKS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The scandal involving a political fund-raiser
three years ago hasn't dissuaded Asian Americans from participating
in politics, politicians and activists say, but has made the
community more wary of those casting themselves as leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The fund-raiser, Chong Lo, was sentenced in federal court last
week for mortgage loan fraud unrelated to her political activities.
</P>
<P>
   Talking about the sentencing, and recent allegations of Chinese
spying at U.S. nuclear weapons facilities, David Lee, president of
the Chinese American Voter Education Committee in San Francisco,
said Asian Americans still have a long road to political
acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Asians are still on the suspect list of the national psyche,''
Lee said. ``It's kind of moved from donors to spies, but it seems
like the whole loyalty question, which was at heart of the campaign
donations scandal, and the Japanese internment in World War II, is
coming back again.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lee emphasized that, although Lo was active in raising
money, she was convicted of wrongdoing unrelated to her political
work, and she was never charged with taking improper foreign
campaign donations, as Democratic Party fund-raiser John Huang was
accused of doing after Lo's arrest in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no linkage between China and Chong Lo,'' he said.
``It was more of a personal issue of defrauding lenders. Her
problems were very personal problems and John Huang's were State
Department problems.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that the suspicions of disloyalty that the recent spy
scandal has inflamed against Asian and Asian-American scientists
and engineers is a much graver concern than one individual's
fraudulent business practices.
</P>
<P>
   Lo, 52, was convicted in U.S. District Court in San Francisco
last September of 12 counts of bank and mail fraud for making false
statements on loan documents while working as a mortgage broker.
</P>
<P>
   She was sentenced on June 2 to 27 months in federal prison and
pay $126,000 in restitution to those she defrauded. Lo plans to
appeal the conviction and remains free on bail.
</P>
<P>
   At the time she was arrested, in July 1996, Lo was chair of an
Asian-American political action group, the Lotus Fund, and was
organizing a gala San Francisco event designed to raise $400,000
for the Democratic National Committee. Lo had hoped President
Clinton would speak at the fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   But within days, the gala was canceled and party officials were
disavowing ties to her.
</P>
<P>
   Lo's conviction has made politically-active Asian Americans more
cautious about checking out the credentials of political
colleagues, even if they share the same goals and support the same
causes, said San Francisco Supervisor Leland Yee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chong Lo situation made us more careful, even of people in
our own community,'' he said. ``If another Lotus Fund group came
along and asked for an endorsement or attendance at an event or a
contribution, we would take a little more time to evaluate that
request.''
</P>
<P>
   Though some political observers predicted that the controversy
over campaign contributions would dampen Asian-American political
participation, Lee said such involvement has actually blossomed in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The donor issue was a very small elite group of people
participating,'' he said. ``We're talking about registering and
voting. Asians are recognizing that Latinos have been very
successful in this area and the majority of political power in the
Latino community is not based on financial contributions, it's
based on votes.''
</P>
<P>
   Where Lo is similar to Huang and others is in her interest in
gaining access to political circles, said Henry Der, a deputy to
California Superintendent of Schools Delaine Eastin and former
director of Chinese for Affirmative Action.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these individuals tried to leverage their contacts, their
ability to raise money to gain access to the party in power,'' he
said. ``They were not advancing issues for poor people in the
(Asian-American) community, like more housing, and better bilingual
education opportunities.''

BLACKS LOOK FOR A PLACE TO CALL HOME IN BOSTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CINDY RODRIGUEZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ During his first week in Boston, Dr. Kevin Hibbert
walked proudly through the halls of Children's Hospital in Boston,
a stethoscope swinging from his neck. He felt he had arrived.
</P>
<P>
   But at night, loneliness sunk in. He searched for black
nightclubs and restaurants, and would end up at the same one or two
spots. He even joined a black ski club _ and he doesn't even ski.
</P>
<P>
   Finding other young black professionals in a city known mostly
for Irish-theme pubs and college-age dance clubs seemed impossible.
And black women? They were elusive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to keep pretending that it doesn't matter,'' Hibbert
said. ``I'm tired. I've been doing it for three years and I don't
want to do it anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   So at the end of the month, Hibbert is moving to Los Angeles.
Add him to the list of black professionals who are leaving Boston.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, hundreds of black professionals have fled the city
after spending a year or two here, through a revolving door that
undermines the potential power of the black middle class. For
Boston, which struggles to live down a reputation for racial
tension, the brain drain has hurt companies seeking to diversify
its staffs, and diminishes the political and social clout of the
black community.
</P>
<P>
   ``It destabilizes neighborhoods and communities, point blank,''
said George ``Chip'' Greenidge, who is organizing a conference that
seeks to make Boston a more welcoming city for blacks. ``It's very
important for 15- and 16-year-olds to see a brother getting up in
the morning and jumping on the bus to get to work.''
</P>
<P>
   This week a committee of African-Americans is holding the first
State of Young Black Boston conference. Greenidge and other black
leaders have worked for more than a year organizing the conference.
</P>
<P>
   Workshops concerning issues such as understanding Boston
politics, buying a home, volunteerism, and what to do on the
weekend are centered on building a Boston that's more comfortable
for black people.
</P>
<P>
   But change will not come easy, some say, especially for one of
America's oldest cities, a place where blacks and whites still
argue over whether racism, in its subtlest forms, exists _ and
where the discussion often turns ugly and ends before it can start.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people say Boston is a racist city, it has to be
acknowledged and not debated,'' said Jane Edmonds, president and
chief executive of Jane C. Edmonds &AMP; Associates, a Boston
management consulting firm. ``It's difficult to engage people in a
discussion about that. If you do, you may be seen as a militant,
someone who doesn't think clear.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the label that Jacqueline Wallace fears. She says she
doesn't like raising the issue because she thinks many white
Bostonians won't understand. But she can't help but speak up: ``For
someone to say racism doesn't exist here, they're out to lunch,''
said Wallace, manager of the School to Work Initiatives at Bell
Atlantic. ``It's everywhere you turn.''
</P>
<P>
   African-Americans point to the lack of black-owned businesses,
the lack of large, black middle-class neighborhoods, of having
little political clout, and to things even harder for non-blacks to
understand. Things such as the reserved, almost aloof mannerisms of
many longtime Bostonians, who to an outsider often come across as
rude. Blacks who were not raised in the city have a hard time
understanding why people in Boston won't smile when they pass them
on the street. For many, it's an unsettling experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lived in Washington, D.C. There it's a totally different
ballgame. Every time you pass someone, you say `hello,' '' Wallace
said. ``Here, I can walk into a store and people won't even
acknowledge me.''
</P>
<P>
   While Wallace views that as evidence of prejudice _ she says she
doesn't see it happening to white people _ others say a person's
perceptions are distorted by the city's reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reasons are, many blacks, Latinos, and other people
of color agree that life in the Boston area comes with sandpaper
uneasiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know a ton of people who have left. I probably know more
than 30 people who have gone,'' said Alvin Crawford, who himself
left Boston a year ago to work for Ogilvy Interactive in Manhattan.
``It's tragic, especially for a city that's that big.''
</P>
<P>
   In a city with a population of about 558,000, blacks accounted
for 26 percent of the residents in 1995, the most recent figures
available. Latinos made up 12 percent and Asian-Americans and
American Indians collectively made up 6 percent, according to the
Massachusetts Institute for Social and Economic Research. Whites
made up 55.7 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Thomas M. Menino said he doesn't think Boston is an
unwelcoming city for blacks or any other minority group. And he
said that opening more black clubs and restaurants would create
more division.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we were trying to get a more integrated community.
That's what we want,'' Menino said. ``You go to Atlanta and the two
groups don't meet.''
</P>
<P>
   Menino said that if someone feels uncomfortable, it is because
they are thinking negatively. He said he occasionally goes to Chef
Lee's on Blue Hill Avenue for soul food, and ``I'm the only white
person there and I don't feel uncomfortable. It's all mindset.''
</P>
<P>
   Crawford agrees _ to a point. He said blacks ``have to be
willing to step outside of their comfort zone,'' but he said they
also need to have places where they can enjoy their music, their
food, their culture.
</P>
<P>
   Crawford said he had a rich life in Boston, but he had to work
at it. He also thinks businesses need to invest in companies such
as The Partnership, a company that has for 11 years worked with the
private sector to retain and groom blacks in mid-level and senior
management.
</P>
<P>
   Bennie Wiley, president and chief executive of The Partnership,
said the key to keeping people of color is to help them establish
important relationships, to make them feel connected. ``If people
don't establish relationships that are important to them
professionally and socially, there is more motivation to leave when
other opportunities come along,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly why Hibbert is leaving. He never found his dream
woman, never made strong friendships, never found a mentor at
Children's Hospital. What lured him to UCLA Medical Center? The
chairman of pediatrics, who is black, told him, ``If you come here,
I will help guide your career.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No one was telling me that here,'' he said. ``No white folks.
No black folks.''

HARD WORK PAYS OFF FOR KING DAY CRUSADERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RALPH JIMENEZ AND JORDANA HART  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. _ They faced no firehoses, billy clubs, or dogs,
no guns or bombs or hurled bottles _ only stares, harsh words, and
a cold Yankee indifference to their hopes and dreams.
</P>
<P>
   It took more than a decade, but a devoted group of civil rights
activists finally won the battle to persuade the state of New
Hampshire to honor Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. with a holiday
bearing his name. Governor Jeanne Shaheen signed legislation Monday
making the third Monday in January Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Civil
Rights Day
</P>
<P>
   For a committee of two dozen people as patient and relentless as
water wearing away at rock, victory brought with it a deep
satisfaction that New Hampshire is at last in step with the rest of
the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as I remember anything, I remember him,'' said Steve
Davis, a teacher at St. Paul's School in Concord, recalling how
King was a hero in the Philadelphia neighborhood where he grew up.
``One part of his message was non-violence but another part was
strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   It was 1990 _ a year when the black population of New
Hampshire's capital city of 36,000 could all have dined in one
restaurant _ when Davis brought his extended family north to
Concord.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know anything about New Hampshire when I came here,''
said Davis, 49, a school administrator, coach, and athlete. ``A
couple of the first nights here I lay in bed shaking and wondering
if I had done the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   With a few stops in between, Davis moved north from Philadelphia
to the campus of St. Paul's School, an academic sanctuary where a
private trout stream flows through the grounds.
</P>
<P>
   One of the things Davis did not know was that he had moved to
one of two states in the nation that did not celebrate a holiday
bearing Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s name. Since 1992, the state
had stood alone in its refusal to honor the slain civil rights
leader.
</P>
<P>
   Though new to the faculty of one of the wealthiest preparatory
schools in the world, Davis gambled. He invited a friend to speak
to an assembly on the eve of the 1990 Martin Luther King holiday.
The speech left the school's minority students hungry for a more
formal way to honor King.
</P>
<P>
   In response, and much to the surprise of everyone, the rector
declared the next day a holiday. Students worked through the night
making signs and crafting a plan. ``I was holding my breath the
whole time because this is St. Paul's. They just don't do this
stuff, so I thought that, man if this doesn't work, I'm out of here
quick,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   At the obligatory morning chapel, speeches were made, prayers
said, and the president of the student body, an African-American,
gave his speech. ``We put a hook in the speech at the end,'' Davis
recalled. ``He said, `If you believe in peace and justice, please
stand' and everybody had to stand. Then he said, `If you believe in
peace and justice, we are going outside to march on the Capitol and
we are going to do it right now.' There was a huge roar and people
just ran out,'' Davis recalled.
</P>
<P>
   That marked the state's first student march in support of the
King holiday, but it would take hundreds of marches and rallies to
persuade the 424-member Legislature. It was at that first march
where Davis heard about Arnie Alpert, and the movement for a King
holiday grew stronger legs.
</P>
<P>
   Alpert, one of the few members of the Martin Luther King Day
Committee in 1988, is the American Friends Service Committee's sole
staff member in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never said this to him, but just watching him operate _
he was the model of Martin Luther King,'' Davis said. ``He never
got excited. He never got upset. He always took everything in
stride, but he never gave up.''
</P>
<P>
   Alpert, 44, grew up in Longmeadow, Mass., in a family that was
politically aware, but not politically active. A slightly built man
whose soft-spoken words emerge from behind a Groucho Marx
moustache, he has had the New Hampshire State House virtually
surrounded for nearly two decades _ moving from one inexpensive
second-floor office to another in buildings across from the State
House, staying just yards from the Capitol steps.
</P>
<P>
   Alpert came to activism through his opposition to nuclear power.
In 1977 he was one of the 1,414 people arrested for occupying the
Seabrook nuclear power plant, so his first two weeks in Concord
were spent jailed in the National Guard armory.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the training in non-violence required of all who took
part in the occupation of the power plant that led Alpert to the
American Friends Service Committee, a Quaker group with
longstanding ties to King, which Alpert joined in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, he has repeatedly been arrested for civil
disobedience: sitting silently on the sofa in Senator Warren
Rudman's office for five days to protest US policies in Nicaragua;
passing out leaflets in a shopping mall denouncing the corporate
exploitation of foreign workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually don't have a record of convictions except for that
last one (the mall leaflets),'' said Alpert, who is appealing that
case to the state Supreme Court in a test of free speech
protections.
</P>
<P>
   Alpert offered the King Day Committee continuity, public
relations skills, a phone, and office space. They made do with
little money, relying instead on volunteers and Alpert's skill in
winning press coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was never a formal group. At one point Lionel was the
chair,'' Alpert said of longtime Representative Lionel Johnson, of
Manchester. ``After that, sometimes Will Thomas served as secretary
and sometimes I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Manchester native Will Thomas, 56, was a founding member of the
committee. A high school history teacher, he turned to non-violent
activism after King's assassination in 1968. ``I was inspired by
King. I learned that you may be beaten, you may be imprisoned, you
may be temporarily sidetracked but you don't give up. My political
activity is an extension of my beliefs that were formed in the
'60s. My wife says that I never left the '60s.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign for a King holiday was a family affair for Lionel
Johnson, the owner of a Manchester dry-cleaning business and one of
three African-Americans now serving in the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in 1979 when Portsmouth Representive James Splaine
filed the first bill to create a King holiday, momentum grew as one
school board after another voted to celebrate it.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, Johnson's daughter Vanessa, by then a Manchester School
Board member, persuaded her colleagues to buck the Manchester Union
Leader newspaper, the state's most prominent conservative voice and
a staunch foe of King and a holiday in his name. By a 7-6 vote, the
school board made King's birthday a holiday in the state's largest
school district.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile Johnson, Alpert said, worked from the inside,
persuading his fellow legislators that King's message was far
greater than his frailties as a man. The best Johnson could win was
a compromise. In 1991 the state enacted Civil Rights Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to be up front,'' Johnson said. ``If we were to
continue with just Martin Luther King Day we never would have
gotten the holiday. It was the same old cop-out. They said, `Why
should one man have his name on a day when Rosa Parks or Abraham
Lincoln don't have a day of their own?' '' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, state after state passed King Day bills; by January
1989, 44 states had a King holiday, including Massachusetts and
Connecticut, which passed legislation in 1974, becoming the second
and third states to do so, behind Illinois. In 1993, when Arizona
began celebrating the holiday, New Hampshire became the lone
holdout, drawing the attention of white supremacist groups who
supported the state's stance. Questions began to be raised about
New Hampshire's commitment to racial equality.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, the engine of the King Day struggle has churned
strongest in Portsmouth, a town soaked in the history of enslaved
Africans and their descendants for more than 350 years. King was a
guest preacher at Portsmouth's People's Baptist Church in 1952 when
he was a doctoral student at Boston University. People's disbanded
in the 1960s and reappeared as New Hope Baptist Church. So it was
no surprise that New Hope would play a key role in New Hampshire's
King Day crusade.
</P>
<P>
   The church sits on 16 acres of mostly untouched land along
Peverly Hill Road, a horse farm on one side and New Hope Pastor
Arthur Hilson's house on the other. Last week, New Hope Baptist was
flush with the joy of the men and women Hilson calls ``the King Day
warriors.''
</P>
<P>
   Hilson's deep connections to the nation's civil rights struggles
have made him an obvious powerpoint for New Hampshire's King Day
fight. He is New England's agent for the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference, founded by King.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I did here was make the fight a visible thing,'' said
Hilson. ``I brought people in from the (civil rights) movement.
Jesse (Jackson) was here twice, and King's daughter (Bernice King)
delivered a King Day message,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Those faces, and their words, made the struggle real for many,
particularly the state's young.
</P>
<P>
   What motivated Mike Vlacich, 26, son of a bookbinder and a
former student aide at Concord High School, to organize a
1,200-student march at the State House in 1991 was, he said, ``what
Martin Luther King did for working people and the poor and people
of color everywhere. It was wrong not to honor Martin Luther King.
I do think people misunderstood who we (New Hampshire residents)
were because of it, but now we've finally done it,'' Vlacich said.
He is now a special assistant for policy in Shaheen's office.

PLAYING INTO MILOSEVIC'S HANDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Corrects spelling of Milosevic in head)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELIZABETH NEUFFER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Don't think a peace deal means that NATO has won the war.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's abrupt acceptance of
Western peace terms last week should not be read as capitulation.
Even if looks like a worse deal than the Rambouillet plan he
rejected, it is not. If anything, the deal contains many elements
in it that the canny Serbian dictator has wanted all along.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, last week's agreement is stunningly lacking in key
details _ giving Milosevic plenty of wiggle room in negotiations on
what happens next _ and it raises the specter of Kosovo's possible
partition.
</P>
<P>
   Further, it gives Milosevic just what he calculated he needed
months ago: a Western security presence, bringing with it Western
money. Why that need? The emergence of the Kosovo Liberation Army
left him little choice.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since his own forces failed to smash the KLA's spirit _ or
halt Albania's support for them _ Milosevic knew he had a problem
that was not likely to go away. His own forces could never
completely guarantee that the KLA was routed. To ensure that the
KLA is held in check, Milosevic knew what he needed: Western troops
on the ground that would be there to disarm them. Last week's peace
deal will do just that.
</P>
<P>
   But getting his own public to accept such forces was a problem.
And Milosevic had other, equally important things to accomplish
first. Accomplish them, he has.
</P>
<P>
   One aim was to lower the number of Kosovars in the province, who
compromised an uncomfortable 90 percent of the population. While
the peace deal assures that the nearly 1 million Kosovars who fled
can return home, it is unlikely that all will.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, the 75,231 that have left the region for the
United States, Australia, and Israel and other countries already
realize they're on track to a far better life than what they had
back home. Those who've quit the refugee camps for a new life in
Albania may decide they are better staying there, too.
</P>
<P>
   A second objective was to undermine the power of those Kosovars
clamoring for independence or supporting the KLA. It remains
unclear just how many Kosovars have been killed, but among them are
likely to be key community leaders who could have mobilized
followers. And Kosovars who do return are likely to be distracted,
for the time being: They will have to focus on rebuilding their
shattered lives, not agitating for political freedom.
</P>
<P>
   As importantly, Milosevic has consolidated his grip on power in
Serbia. Had he signed the Rambouillet deal, he would have appeared
to have capitulated to the West. Now he looks domestically like a
peacebroker who saved his people from further destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, the NATO bombing campaign, which continued into this week,
helped him strengthen his grip back home by shattering his
opposition. The most loyal proponents of democracy are now bitter
and disenchanted with the West. He has all but destroyed the
independent media. The powers Milosevic assumed during his wartime
state of emergency are likely to remain, ensuring that Serbia
becomes a virtual police state.
</P>
<P>
   Even the outrage expressed by Deputy Prime Minister Vojislav
Seselj _ who has said he will quit _ and his Radical Party plays
into Milosevic's hands. With the threat of extreme nationalists who
could sink the deal, the West will hasten to ensure Milosevic stays
in power, because he can guarantee the peace and keep Seselj under
control. His power, alas, is likely to remain unquestioned and
absolute.
</P>
<P>
   And the fact that Milosevic has embraced the deal has also
guaranteed his impunity, for now. The peace plan notably makes no
mention of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former
Yugoslavia, which indicted Milosevic and his top aides last week.
It remains unclear just how NATO will make good on its promises to
to the tribunal that its investigators would be able to ride in
with the troops.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Russian troops, traditional allies of the Serbs,
will patrol a part of Kosovo also raises the potential for the
province's future partition. Russian troops could choose to patrol
the north, along the Serbian border. That would ensure that
mineral-rich territory, with many of the key Serbian religious
sites, remains in Slavic hands. Kosovo's Serbs will feel
comfortable remaining there.
</P>
<P>
   But Kosovar Albanians may not. They may chose to group wherever
American, British, or other NATO troops patrol, feeling more
comfortable under their oversight.
</P>
<P>
   The net result may be a Serb-dominated north, and a Kosovar
dominated south.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most importantly, last week's peace deal means Milosevic
may have found a way to hang on to power while solving some of his
country's long-term economic problems. One reason Milosevic has
resorted time and again to war over the last decade was because he
knew he could not hold onto power while making the painful
transition from a communist economy to a free-market one.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Western aid is likely to come pouring into the region (with
some of it being skimmed off the top for Milosevic and his
cronies). The money surrounding the 50,000 peacekeepers in the
region alone will go a long way to rejuvenating business. And
someone will have to foot the bill _ or loan Serbia the money _ to
repair the damage done by the NATO bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   All of this is not to say Milosevic didn't make some flawed
calculations over the last few months. He expected the NATO
alliance to fissure earlier, and for less bombing to occur. The
flow of refugees to neighboring countries did not destabilize the
region _ and his neighbors, Albania and Macedonia _ as much as he
would have liked.
</P>
<P>
   But he wisely calculated that NATO would not risk putting in the
ground troops that would sweep him and his regime from power.
Knowing that, he has accepted a deal that may well solve some of
his most pressing domestic problems _ while ensuring he gets what
he wants most: continued power in the Balkans.

REPUBLICAN BOMBS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT JORDAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It looks like deja vu all over again. Even as President Clinton
claims another political victory, some Republicans are going after
him, oblivious to lessons from earlier tangles with him.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans are no longer trying to snare Clinton over a sex
scandal; they know that doesn't work. No, this time they are trying
to snare Clinton on the air war against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that Clinton was right all along; ground troops
were not necessary, despite what military experts and even some
Democrats said. It appears that NATO has won the war with the sole
use of air power, as evidenced by Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic's concessions last week. The peace deal he says he is
willing to accept is strikingly similar to the earlier peace
proposal he rejected before attacking Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Milosevic stalls on his acceptance of the deal, the air
war has clearly had an impact.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is gaining even more leverage on Milosevic by continuing
the bombing until he sees clear evidence of the Yugoslav
president's final acceptance of the terms for peace.
</P>
<P>
   Yet some Republicans are continuing to politically bomb Clinton.
But the GOP's bombs are not quite having the effect on Clinton that
NATO's bombs are having on Milosevic. The Republicans are finding
that tossing these bombs may be doing more political damage to them
than they are doing to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a federal judge last week said at a hearing that he
will decide early this week whether to hear a case brought by 31
members of Congress, including four Democrats, who argued that the
US bombing of Yugoslavia is illegal. The hearing came about the
same time that a peace agreement was accepted by the Yugoslav
parliament, which is controlled by Milsoevic.
</P>
<P>
   If the judge does not dismiss the case, a hearing on the s case
is scheduled for June 23, by which time it could well be a moot
issue, if the peace agreement is signed on by all parties. it could
also be another embarassment for the Republicans if the case goes
forward. Their argument against Clinton on his role in the war
appears even weaker than the impeachment charges on which Clinton
was easily acquitted.
</P>
<P>
   The members of Congress bringing the case to court argue that
Clinton is violating the War Powers Act of 1973 because he did not
get congressional authorization for the use of US troops in a
conflict that goes beyond 60 days. They refer to a 213-213 House
vote on authorization of the war, and a vote of 427-2 against the
US declaring war in the Yugoslav conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The President's counsel, Philip Bartz, says the group is asking
the courts to involve itself in a political matter. More bluntly,
the group wants the court to intervene in an ongoing battle between
the Clinton administration and Congressional conservatives who are
apparently still bitter over their failure to get Clinton ousted on
impeachment charges. With this motivation, the largely Republican
group is again over-reaching in their efforts to get Clinton in
their clutches.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the courtroom, Rep. Roscoe Bartlett, a Republican from
Maryland, defended the suit, saying its purpose is to declare the
US involvement in the conflict illegal, and thus put pressure on
Clintion to end the conflict, if it is not ended by the time the
case is heard.
</P>
<P>
   But then, Bartlett exposes his true motives, telling reporters:
``He will either comply with the law, or we will impeach him.''
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett and other Republicans with a single-minded dislike of
Clinton apparently have not learned anything from their failed
impeachment experience.
</P>
<P>
   The American public never wanted Clinton impeached, but
right-wing Republicans kept pushing forward until they fell off a
political cliff.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Republicans are doing again what most Americans do not
want them to do: seeking legal action against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton is successful in forcing Milosevic to end the war and
fully accept the peace terms, he will look more like a war hero
than the incompetent commander in chief his critics have tried to
paint him as. And right now things are headed Clinton's way.
</P>
<P>
   Although it may still be a little early for the White House, and
NATO, to do any serious celebrating, there has to be more than a
few wide smiles around the White House these days _ including some
from Vice President Al Gore Jr., who will reap some political
benefits from the war's resolution, and Hillary Rodham Clinton, all
but certain to run for the US Senate seat in New York. There
probably won't be many negative questions about her husband's
handling of the war as she campaigns across the state.
</P>
<P>
   But the widest smile of all may be Clinton's, as he looks back
on the times he had two strikes against him, on the impeachment
trial and now on the Kosovo conflict, and hits a home run to win
both games.
</P>
<P>
   And the right-wing Republicans can only shake their heads, once
again, and wonder how he managed to beat them again. Perhaps they
might consider that in such battles, the good guys do win _ and, in
the eyes of the American public, conservative Republican's all-out
``get Clinton'' campaigns are definitely not seen as good.

BECAUSE OF GEARAN'S TENACITY, PEACE CORPS IS THRIVING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Best to start on a bipartisan note about a man who
made it in the big leagues without once checking his principles at
the door.
</P>
<P>
   Largely because of Mark Gearan's vision and tenacity, the Peace
Corps, one of the best ideas of post-'50s America, is in the
process of getting ginned up by a Republican Congress under a
Democratic president to a level of activity not seen in more than a
generation.
</P>
<P>
   Ten thousand dedicated people will be serving abroad three years
from now, which is fabulous news for a great many needy nations,
including new partners Jordan, Bangladesh, and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   It is also fabulous news for the United States, whose superpower
status demands good works. And fabulous news for those mostly young
Americans (as well as a growing number of over-50 volunteers) who
are quietly reviving national service as a worthy pursuit.
</P>
<P>
   But it is also an eloquent tribute to the work of one person who
has never been quite what he seems to be, and who has managed at 42
to do a lot more than put fresh life into a vital program. Included
in that is helping build a Democratic Party capable of governing
the country with new ideas. The scouting report says ``great guy,
everybody loves him, plays a mean piano, selfless, decent, and
super-smart.'' That's not half of it.
</P>
<P>
   All over most of Washington last week _ in the middle of Kosovo
_ people were buzzing about something else, word that Gearan would
stop running the Peace Corps this summer to take over the
presidency of Hobart and William Smith Colleges, two smaller-school
gems in upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   Washington is a tough town; departures are routine and rarely
noted. But this was different, a widespread murmuring of delight at
Gearan's good fortune, true sadness that he's moving, and more than
a little quiet confidence that he will be a Cabinet secretary
someday.
</P>
<P>
   The buzz was on Capitol Hill, among the Republican authorizers
and appropiators who built the hoops Gearan jumped through to win
his campaign for an expanded Peace Corps, as well as a new
operation using experienced volunteers in humanitarian crisis
situations.
</P>
<P>
   And, less surprising, it included President Clinton and his
wife, Vice President Gore and his wife, the current and former
secretaries of state, every domestic policy official of consequence
in the administration, and everybody who did anything or knows
anything of consequence about presidential politics over the last
three cycles.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a resume; it's an instructive life, and a good place
to begin is in the middle. It's the late fall of 1991 at Georgetown
University and Governor Bill Clinton is making the first of three
lengthy, complex policy speeches about a different kind of
Democratic agenda. Only a few people are with him, most notably Al
From of the centrist Democratic Leadership Council, which Clinton
had headed; also in the entourage was Gearan, then in his third
year of running the Democratic Governors Association, another early
Clinton power and networking center.
</P>
<P>
   In the crafting of what would become a successful and popular
domestic policy, they were, at the outset, almost the symbolic yin
and yang of opportunity and responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Gearan already had rich experience: Harvard University,
Representative Robert Drinan's fourth reelection campaign, a year
in the journalism racket, then a chance in Washington with former
Iowa Representative Berkley Biddell, then a bigger chance with
Governor Michael Dukakis.
</P>
<P>
   In running the federal office in Massachusetts and then as a
senior aide in Dukakis's star-crossed presidential campaign, Gearan
helped generate ideas that foreshadowed the Clinton presidency.
Then in '92, he helped make a president, staffed the selection of
Al Gore, ran Gore's campaign, and then staffed Clinton's
transition. The White House was chaos for two years, but Gearan's
office was an island of sanity and never falsehood.
</P>
<P>
   For those surprised that he went on to be arguably the most
important director of the Peace Corps since Sargent Shriver
himself, the image had been ``nice, quiet staff guy.'' And it was
always wrong, as his very proud mom is happy to explain.
</P>
<P>
   Gearan lost his dad, the principal of Gardner High, when he was
only 12. Martha Gearan says her youngest was devastated but never
lost his bearings and was never afraid to tackle hard things. But
he always did so quietly. She knew he was applying to Boston
College, but didn't find out he had filled out an application to
Harvard until he told her. When she drove him to Cambridge for his
interview, she worried that he didn't have a briefcase like most of
the other kids. He told her not to worry, and I doubt she has
since.
</P>
<P>
   Washington may be a tough town and a tough business, but for
those not afraid to be quixotic, the Mark Gearans reward your faith
every day.

THE WISDOM OF GALBRAITH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN NOLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When he was US ambassador to India, he gave ``The Last Hurrah''
to Jawaharlal Nehru. The prime minister was ``enchanted'' with
Edwin O'Connor's novel of Frank Skeffington, a mayor much like
Boston's James Michael Curley. Both recipient and donor liked the
last chapter, in which Skeffington resolutely refuses to repent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd Do It Again!'' was Curley's own autobiography, its theme
echoed in the latest book among the dozens written by John Kenneth
Galbraith. ``Name-Dropping: From FDR On'' is mischievously and
merrily unrepentant. The author really did know Eleanor Roosevelt:
``Her dress was agreeably utilitarian; the effect was always of
tweed.'' And Harry Truman: ``He had an active mind and superb
common sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Galbraith's recollections exude a triumphal air. As its
self-mocking title suggests, he considers modesty an over-rated
virtue. The dust jacket notes that the author was ``born in 1908.''
The tone is as insistent as Bruce Springsteen's ``born in the
USA,'' although Galbraith was born in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with a degree from Ontario Agricultural College, he has
moved in rarefied circles of academe, politics, and diplomacy with
a farm boy's hard-won self-assurance. For more than six decades, he
has deployed wit and intelligence to dismantle a structure he once
baptized as ``the conventional wisdom.'' It must be marvelous to be
proven right while still upright.
</P>
<P>
   Part of Galbraith's genius is his ability to accept yes for an
answer. A Galbraith hero, Adlai Stevenson, proposed in the 1950s
that money spent on auto tailfins be spent on education, echoing
the arguments of Galbraith's ``The Affluent Society.'' He twice
lost to Eisenhower, whom the professor now calls ``one of the most
underestimated presidents of our time. A Republican, he accepted
the great social legacy of Franklin D. Roosevelt and the 20-year
New Deal era and made it an integral part of American life, FDR
initiated, Truman continued, Eisenhower confirmed.''
</P>
<P>
   By saluting a conservative slogan, ``If it ain't broke, don't
fix it,'' Galbraith has broadened the liberal canon. Liking Ike is
now OK.
</P>
<P>
   ``Name-Dropping'' includes confessions of the author's
ineptitude in politics. He regrets having opposed George McGovern's
choice of Kevin White as a vice presidential candidate in 1972
because he feared, ``as a leader of the Massachusetts delegation .
. . an unseemly row on the floor.'' It's hard to imagine unrest in
the group Tip O'Neill called ``the cast of `Hair.' ''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Today &LR; , Galbraith's world is more like the cast of a Noel
Coward play, particularly his annual garden party after Harvard's
commencement. The hedgerows bristle with honorary degree recipients
and Nobel laureates outnumber dandelions as Mr. and Mrs. Galbraith
preside at a ritual that has enriched more than 35 June
 &UR; afternoon &LR; s.
</P>
<P>
   Indomitable, of course. Indestructible, surely. Galbraith has
also reached the point where he is bigger than Harvard, or at least
taller, the spire of Memorial Church excepted.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard's reputation is liberal in large part because of
Galbraith. Every university is conservative in some respects, but
Harvard's board of overseers has too often been a treehouse of
Colonel Blimps and Major Hooples, several of whom sought to deny
tenure to Galbraith in 1947, according to Henry Rosovsky, a Harvard
legend himself, in his essay, ``The Most Famous Professor at
Harvard.''
</P>
<P>
   A beacon of liberalism, Galbraith has outlasted his critics and
outshone an institution whose self-regard he has often satirized.
He rejected what he called ``the highly implausible traditions'' of
Harvard life, favoring intellect over sentiment without
surrendering the loyalty and affection of generations of students
and colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   This 90-year-old memoirist may have more to offer. He once
approvingly quoted Noel Coward: ``I have a memory like an elephant.
In fact, elephants often consult me.''

A PEACE WITHOUT HONOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like so much else that Bill Clinton has had a hand in, the
Kosovo peace plan is a shabby betrayal.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout this conflict, Clinton has used analogies to Germany
and World War II to justify the NATO operation. It was not an
unfair comparison, despite the vast difference in scale. True, the
Serbs were not embarked on continental conquest or exterminating
men, women, and children in gas chambers. But like the Nazis, they
had pitilessly deployed terror and violence against a minority in
their midst. What they called ``ethnic cleansing'' had left
thousands dead and hundreds of thousands homeless. Not since
Hitler's time had Europe witnessed such brutality: women rounded up
to be raped by Serb soldiers, whole communities emptied at
gunpoint, villages in flames, mass graves.
</P>
<P>
   So let us contemplate what peace with Germany would have looked
like if it had been organized along the lines now on offer in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   There would have been no German surrender. Instead, the Allies
would have negotiated an armistice with the German high command in
Berlin, whereby the Wehrmacht would pull out of the lands it had
overrun and an international force would move in to ensure the
safety of the locals and enable refugees to return. Some of these
peacekeepers would have come from America and its Allies; others
would have been drawn from nations, friendly to Germany, that had
supported the Nazis during the war _ Austrians, Turks, perhaps
Ukrainians.
</P>
<P>
   Even after its troops withdrew, Germany would have retained
sovereignty over the territory it had annexed. Sudeten Czechs and
Gdansk Poles who had fled when the Nazis moved in would be allowed
to return, but on the understanding that they were returning to the
Third Reich.
</P>
<P>
   In Berlin, the Nazi Party would have remained in control. There
would have been no de-Nazification, no war crimes trials. The
Allies would not have occupied Germany, let alone compelled it to
become a democracy. Generously, however, Americans would have paid
to repair and rebuild German cities damaged by US bombs; indeed
President Roosevelt would have vowed to do so even as the bombs
were falling. By contrast, the question of reparations for the
Nazis' victims would have been left open. Certainly peace would not
have depended on any Nazi promise to make whole those who survived
their savagery.
</P>
<P>
   Hitler, of course, would have stayed on as fuehrer. Destroying
his regime would never have been the Allies' aim, and they would
have had no qualms about negotiating with him. Critics would have
howled that leaving Hitler in power was unforgivable, a blunder of
staggering proportions. But FDR's spin machine would have gone into
overdrive, and the deal with Hitler would have been hailed as a
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Just like the deal with Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   The Butcher of Belgrade, the cause of Europe's worst
bloodletting in 50 years, should have been put on notice from the
outset that the United States and its NATO allies intended to
capture him, prosecute him for his crimes against humanity, and
hang him and his henchmen from a gallows. Not only would that have
achieved a measure of justice, it would have sent an unignorable
warning to the planet's other would-be Milosevices.
</P>
<P>
   All contact with Milosevic should have ceased when the War
Crimes Tribunal indicted him. To continue negotiating with such a
villain, to treat him as a legitimate leader with whom a settlement
could be reached, was shameful, an abdication of moral leadership.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's ``victory'' over the Serbs should seem familiar, for we
have seen such triumphs before. Just ask Saddam Hussein. Military
defeat and repeated attacks from the air have not weakened his grip
on power. His drive to stock an arsenal with nuclear, chemical, and
biological weapons has not slowed. He remains a deadly menace, and
only an ongoing Western presence in Iraq's airspace keeps him from
resuming his war against the Kurdish minority within his borders.
</P>
<P>
   The extent of our betrayal of the Kosovars will become clear in
the weeks ahead. Already, though, their losses far outweigh
Milosevic's.
</P>
<P>
   The Rambouillet accord, which NATO went to war to enforce,
guaranteed the Kosovars more than autonomy. It promised them a
plebiscite on independence in 2002. That promise is now worthless;
there is no hint of a plebiscite in the peace terms that Milosevic
has accepted, and you will not hear the word ``Rambouillet'' escape
NATO lips.
</P>
<P>
   The Serb troops who terrorized the Kosovars are not required to
disarm under the armistice agreement. The ``demilitarization of the
Kosovo Liberation Army,'' however, is explicitly mandated. Clearly
the KLA will not turn its weapons over to the Yugoslav Army. Which
means it will fall to the international peacekeepers, the supposed
guarantors of the Kosovars' safety, to take away the Kosovars'
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav war, fought so as to minimize NATO's casualties,
maximized the suffering of the people it was meant to help. It
failed to accomplish its foremost goal _ halting the violence in
Kosovo and blocking the Serbs from widening their expulsions. This
``peace,'' too, will not live up to its billing. For it is a peace
that resembles the president who will embrace it. Both are without
honor.

LOSING TOUCH: RELIANCE ON STETHOSCOPE WANES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nothing is more symbolic of the doctor's art than the
stethoscope; one physician-writer even likens it to a therapeutic
``umbilical cord'' that represents the intimate bond between the
doctor and patient.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, nearly 200 years after its invention, the stethoscope is
losing its once preeminent place as a diagnostic tool to more
accurate, though costly, high-tech tests like the echocardiogram
and CT scan.
</P>
<P>
   Physicians still, of course, carry their stethoscopes like a
badge of honor, draped around their necks. But compared to their
elders, today's young doctors have proven less skilled at detecting
and interpreting the faint whooshes and clicks of a sick heart.
</P>
<P>
   Some argue that's just technological evolution: what's the point
of making such an effort to learn the subtleties of ausculation
(listening to heart sounds) when there's an ultrasound test
(echocardiogram) that shows the beating heart and its glitches in a
detailed, computerized image?
</P>
<P>
   Defenders of the stethoscope say this new attitude leads to the
overuse of costly tests. Beyond this, these critics feel that those
who accept the ``death of the stethoscope'' are part of a
disheartening trend in which doctors are becoming remote, less of
the ``hands-on'' healers who listened not only to their patients'
bodies but their thoughts and fears as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel that it's an enormous problem and a huge amount is
being lost,'' says Dr. William Silen, a veteran surgeon and
renowned diagnostician who is Dean for Faculty Development and
Diversity at Harvard Medical School. Silen contends that with his
hands and ears he could render just as accurate a diagnosis of
abdominal pain (his specialty) as a CT scan could _ and do it more
cheaply. In fact, it is wrong-headed cost cutting by managed care
companies, says Silen, that's responsible for declining hands-on
competence. ``(Doctors) are not acquiring the skills in history
taking and physical examination because they're not given the time
to do these things,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The debate has prompted a re-examination of the training of new
doctors. Some medical schools, including Harvard's, have expanded
their training in the use of stethoscopes and other hands-on
methods of diagnoses. To help the less aurally gifted, one company
has just introduced an electronic stethoscope that amplifies heart
sounds 14 times and filters out unimportant noise. The
Hewlett-Packard Stethos, ``has lots of advantages'' over the
traditional type, says Dr. Julian Aroesty, a cardiologist at Beth
Israel Deaconess Medical Center who recently tried it out, ``except
that it's more expensive'' at about $350 vs. $50 to $100 for a
traditional model.
</P>
<P>
   Some doctors and medical educators argue that expert abilities
in using the stethoscope and tapping and feeling different parts of
the body may not be quite as crucial  &UR; today &LR;  as in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I trained as an intern in 1963 and 1964, that's what we
spent our time doing with patients _ listening to their story and
listening to their heart,'' says Dr. Marshall Wolf, vice chairman
for medical education at Brigham and Women's Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``We listened because we didn't have that much therapy _ we
couldn't fix the blood vessels or operate on the heart'' to the
extent now possible.
</P>
<P>
   While  &UR; today &LR; 's young doctors can't hear all the fine points of
heart sounds, Wolf adds, ``they have a different set of skills:
they know a lot of things that people of my generation never
dreamed of'' and which may be more important to the patient's
outcome _ especially very sick patients in the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Wolf says, the ability to perform a physical exam and use
a stethoscope are important for doctors who see relatively healthy
patients and need to screen them for hidden health problems.
</P>
<P>
   Aroesty, who calls auscultation with the stethoscope ``a dying
art,'' says it's a skill ``that has been lost in part because it's
not needed as much as it was before _ the same reason kids  &UR; today &LR; 
can't add and subtract because they all have hand calculators.''
The doctors' version of hand calculators include the
echocardiogram, CT, and MRI tests that create computerized pictures
of normal and abnormal structures of the body.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors have been bemoaning the erosion of physical exam and
auscultation skills since the 1980s, but the most urgent wakeup
call came in September 1997, when the Journal of the American
Medical Association published the results of a test of stethoscope
skills.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers led by Dr. Salvatore Mangione at the Allegheny
University of the Health Sciences played recordings of heart sounds
representing 12 different abnormalities, and asked 453 resident
physicians and medical students to identify them.
</P>
<P>
   On average, the internal medicine and family practice physicians
correctly identified only 20 percent of the heart problems, which
wasn't significantly better than the medical students. The
researchers called this accuracy rate ``disturbingly low'' and
raised concerns that this was also true of other ``bedside
diagnostic skills.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate has been raging ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Those who deplore the trend argue not so much that patient care
is suffering, but that it's costing the health care system millions
of dollars in needless, expensive echocardiograms and other tests.
Skillful use of the stethoscope ``is the most cost-effective way to
determine what's the next test'' a patient should have, contends
Dr. Robert J. Adolphe, a semi-retired cardiologist at the
University of Cincinnati who wrote an editorial in the journal
Chest last year titled ``In Defense of the Stethoscope.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is that those of us who know how to use a
stethoscope are (virtually) gone,'' says Adolph. ``I'm not sure
that there are going to be any teachers around'' to train the next
generation, he adds, ``and I think it's a shame.''
</P>
<P>
   Although doctors had for centuries pressed their ears to
patients' bodies as a crude diagnostic method, the first
stethoscope is credited to the French doctor Rene Laennec who, in
1816, rolled paper into a tube that relayed the sound to his ear.
History books say that Laennec's invention stemmed from his
uneasiness about placing his ear directly on a woman patient's
chest.
</P>
<P>
   The familiar stethoscope with its rubber tube, metal listening
part, and earpieces, has changed little in recent decades while
serving as the workhorse of diagnosis _ and not just for the heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I use my stethoscope every time I walk in to see a patient,''
says Dr. Ellen Rothman, a resident in pediatrics at Children's
Hospital in Boston. ``I listen to the heart, the lungs, and the
belly _ it's a great screening tool.'' She adds that young children
frequently have respiratory symptoms, and Rothman and other doctors
emphasize that even if the stethoscope became outdated for cardiac
diagnoses, it would have full employment for use in detecting fluid
in the lungs, wheezing, and so forth.
</P>
<P>
   Until the 1970s, when computerized images using ultrasound
technology became available, listening to the sounds of the heart
was the only noninvasive way to detect and identify different heart
problems. And it took lots of training and experience.
</P>
<P>
   As one author notes, it calls for identifying ``sounds that are
at the threshold of audibility and are packed into a very short
time interval,'' sometimes just fractions of a second. Studies have
shown that doctors who are trained musicians do better at
auscultation.
</P>
<P>
   An expert at the skill can detect quite a list of conditions by
identifying characteristic sounds, known as murmurs, clicks,
rumbles, snaps, gallops, and rubs. The sounds are emitted by blood
flowing over and through deformed or leaky valves, or by extra or
mistimed openings and shuttings of valves.
</P>
<P>
   For some of the critics, the fading of stethoscope skills
sharply reflects the downgrading of hands-on medicine, which may in
itself, in some intangible way, help patients get better. Dr.
Michael Kirsch, a physician in Highland Heights, Ohio, who compares
the stethoscope to an umbilical cord, says that technology is one
of the forces that are driving doctors and patients apart. ``This
is a complaint I hear a lot _ patients say, `All I'm getting are
tests and prescriptions','' says Kirsch.
</P>
<P>
   The concerns are not lost on medical educators. ``There's no
doubt that the average young physician's skills'' in examining
patients ``are not going to be what the best clinicians had several
decades ago,'' says Dr. Paul Wang, an attending cardiologist at New
England Medical Center who teaches at Tufts University School of
Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   At Tufts, training in physical exam skills is now being started
earlier. And there's a conscious effort to teach doctors how to
build a rapport with patients, Wang says.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Armstrong, director of medical education at Harvard
Medical School, says Harvard has been bolstering the teaching of
basic hands-on skills for more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   As early as the first year of medical school, she says, students
are ``learning to speak with patients and capture their story, and
learn many of these qualities you're looking for in your doctor.''
</P>
<P>
   Stethoscope and other physical exam skills are receiving more
attention and time, adds Armstrong. And, she said, students will
have to demonstrate that they are competent in these skills by
taking a new practical exam that's going to launched later this
year.

CRUISE LINES ARE COURTING THE SIPPY-CUP SET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY BINGHAM 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You marry, you have kids, you kiss grown-up vacations goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   Or you leave the country.
</P>
<P>
   Cruise ships sure make it tempting to travel with children.
Since Disney sailed into the competition last year, there's a
renewed interest in the family dollar. Norwegian expanded its
program to include toddlers, Princess dropped the minimum age to
include infants, and Carnival expects 200,000 children to sail
before the year ends.
</P>
<P>
   But a parent worries: Can a child sit through a six-course meal?
</P>
<P>
   Meet ours, ``Master Wilson,'' as his ticket dubbed him. He's
nearly 3, still in diapers, fond of elephants, peanut butter and
wearing cowboy boots (and nothing else).
</P>
<P>
   Here's what we learned after a week with Wilson aboard the
Norwegian Sea, on a cruise to Mexico and Honduras:
</P>
<P>
   Our first concern _ seasickness _ arrives soon after we leave
the Port of Houston and sail into choppy swells 8 feet high. Wilson
hobbles down the narrow hall, maintaining his balance with his
elephant, Toothbrush, under his arm. The seasickness medicine stays
in the suitcase all week.
</P>
<P>
   Dinner brings our next worry. We see on the menu that pate,
salad, pheasant consomme, beef Wellington and a cheese course will
arrive before Wilson's favorite: dessert. We know the number of
kids on board is 200 among 1,500 total. The odds that our dining
companions will also eat rice with their hands, as Wilson does, are
against us.
</P>
<P>
   We get lucky and find ourselves across a table from 10-year-old
Ashley. Her appreciation for Beanie Babies, Matchbox cars and
macaroni and cheese saved us during Western Night, Caribbean Night,
casual night and two formal-wear nights.
</P>
<P>
   TIP: Ask in advance to be seated with another family. It's a top
complaint among parents on Internet cruise-review sites. Improve
your odds by traveling at times when children are off from school.
If that doesn't work, ask the maitre d' to move you.
</P>
<P>
   Norwegian, like other major cruise lines, has menus aimed at
picky eaters. The standards arrive on heavy china: burgers, fries,
hot dogs, grilled cheese and the beloved peanut butter-and-jelly
sandwich. Because the waiters know that parents stuff the tip
envelope at week's end, the sandwich comes with the crust removed.
</P>
<P>
   Another TIP: Not every meal has to be eaten over nine pieces of
silverware. Save the endurance tests for dinner and try the
buffet-service dining room near the swimming pools.
</P>
<P>
   Large cruise lines such as Norwegian, Princess, Holland America,
Royal Caribbean and Carnival embrace children with hourly programs
crammed with scavenger hunts, magic shows and silly games. But find
out where you'll be parking the kids. Some ships place children
beside arcades and ice cream parlors _ and some have wading pools,
teen-age discos, even playrooms with Little Tykes toys. But other
ships house their programs in windowless rooms near the bottom of
the boat.
</P>
<P>
   Quiz your travel agent about counselor training, too, and
whether different ages are lumped together for programs. Because
activities beyond Play-Doh and easel painting can leave a toddler
bewildered, one of the best alternatives can be baby-sitting.
</P>
<P>
   On our cruise, group sitting is free for potty-trained kids, but
for Wilson, we paid $8 an hour for a Swedish woman at the reception
desk to moonlight as a sitter. She took him to see ``Peter Pan''
and fed him chocolate. We had wine with dinner and champagne at a
blues show. All three of us awoke happy the next morning.
</P>
<P>
   TIP: Not all ships offer baby-sitting, so check first if you
want a night out.
</P>
<P>
   Space can be a concern for large families, but veteran cruisers
joke that cabin size doesn't matter, because nobody spends time
there anyway. Newer ships have added suites for families who want
extra bathrooms, and larger ships even have connecting rooms. Most,
though, translate to a cabin with bunks or cramming the twin beds
together.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson surprised us in a stateroom: He found a bathroom door to
hang from; two closets to hide in; a bed to crawl under; a space to
sleep between us when the beds were put together; and a window
seat, where early bird walkers on the promenade deck caught him
wearing his cowboy boots and nothing else.
</P>
<P>
   But the best time for our family came outside the cabin, when we
kicked back in deck chairs and the ocean was all we could see. One
of us realized that we were so far from the mainland it would cost
$7.95 a minute to call work. So we didn't bother.

SEEING BLUE ON THE RED PLANET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The latest news from Mars shows that the red planet _ which
today is drier than the Sahara _ may once have had vast expanses of
blue.
</P>
<P>
   Data sent back by the Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft over the
last few weeks have provided several lines of evidence to bolster
the idea that an ancient ocean existed on Mars, more than a mile
deep and thousands of miles across. If these early indications are
confirmed, it would greatly raise the odds that there could have
been life on Mars, and even that some primitive, single-celled
creatures may be living there now.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the vast northern lowland area of Mars is the smoothest,
most featureless expanse of land of its size ever seen on any
planet, according to the latest information sent back by the
spacecraft. And, it turns out, the rim of this smooth basin is
virtually level _ just as would be expected if it was, in fact, the
floor of an ancient sea.
</P>
<P>
   And that's not all. Six different river channels, which were
photographed by the Viking mission to Mars in 1976, all empty into
this northern lowland, and all signs of their channels disappear at
just the level of the supposed ocean shoreline. Unless they reached
a body of standing water at that point, why would the channels
suddenly stop, scientists wonder, since the downward slope
continues for hundreds of miles further.
</P>
<P>
   All of this information ``is consistent with a standing body of
water,'' said James Head, a planetary scientist at Brown
University, last week at a meeting in Boston of the American
Geophysical Union. Head added that the new data ``do not
necessarily prove'' that such an ocean existed, although it is very
difficult to explain the features any other way.
</P>
<P>
   These findings are among the most dramatic new discoveries so
far from Mars Global Surveyor, which after nearly two years of
adjusting its orbit has been mapping the red planet in detail since
early March.
</P>
<P>
   The craft's high-precision laser altimeter, a device that can
pinpoint details of surface topography to within one foot of
elevation, has also shown clear signs of a relatively flat shelf of
land bordering this ancient sea, somewhat like a continental shelf
on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, Head and his colleagues say, the amount of water
contained in the ancient Martian ocean would have been enough to
cover the entire planet to a depth of more than 300 feet, if it
were spread out uniformly over the whole planet. (The surface area
of Mars is approximately equal to the dry-land surface of Earth).
This ocean, Head estimates, would have been about one-third the
size of the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Most startling of all is the new data showing the remarkable
smoothness of this region of Mars _ perhaps buried under millions
of years worth of sediments deposited by this ancient sea.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know of anywhere smoother,'' said David Smith, one of
Global Surveyor's principal scientists. ``There's nothing on Earth,
nothing on Venus that smooth, on that kind of scale. It's like the
Bonneville Flats,'' a perfectly flat, dried lake bed in the Nevada
desert, but much more extensive. ``You can go for probably 1,000
miles with only variations (in height) of 5 to 10 meters,'' or 15
to 30 feet, he said (not counting the continual downward slope of
this whole expanse).
</P>
<P>
   Not that any of the new data can actually prove that there was
an ocean on the surface of Mars long ago. For clear proof, humans
may need to travel to Mars and dig deeply into the basins in search
of evidence of an accumulation of water-borne sediments, or of a
high water table or extensive permafrost in the region. ``I'm
guessing we'll have to visit,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   But the likelihood of a past ocean has certainly increased
dramatically as a result of the new findings. The data make it
``much more likely'' that such an ocean existed, Smith said. Still,
he added, there is no ``smoking gun.''
</P>
<P>
   Head has carried out ``a really careful analysis,'' said
planetary scientist Maria Zuber of the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, and ``everything he says is consistent with large
standing bodies of water.'' While nothing found so far proves it,
she said, new images from Global Surveyor could eventually make the
case by, for example, showing clear, distinct shoreline features.
</P>
<P>
   The suggestion that Mars may once have had an ocean was made
before, based on evidence from the Viking mission of 1976, but the
signs at that time were far more ambiguous. The more detailed
Global Surveyor data greatly strengthened the case, providing
several lines of additional evidence, including these:
</P>
<P>
   --Planetary scientist Timothy Parker published a paper in 1989
describing martian features that looked like an ancient shoreline,
but he had no information at that time about the actual elevations
of the features he saw in Viking pictures. Now that the true
elevations of points on the surface are known, it turns out that
these shoreline features _ identified solely on the basis of their
appearance _ really are all at about the same level. ``The fact
that it is that close _ that doesn't happen by luck,'' said Smith.
(Small changes in elevation may have occurred as a result of
millions of years of volcanic activity, wind erosion and other
processes since the oceans dried up). ---The volume of water that
would have been contained in these ancient oceans matches very well
with previous estimates of how much water must have flowed out of
all the apparent river channels seen on the surface. The estimates
reached by Head and his co-workers fall about midway between the
maximum and minimum estimates others have made of the total amount
of water that may have existed on Mars.
</P>
<P>
   --Research by a separate team also found a remarkable dichotomy
that corresponds to this same boundary line. An analysis of the
shapes of 1,600 small craters, carried out by James Garvin of
NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, found that virtually all of the
craters inside the boundary are distinctly different from those
outside it. ``When we saw that, we were stunned,'' Garvin said.
``We saw a striking difference.'' He thinks this might reflect a
layer of ice beneath the soil of the ``ocean'' area, adding some
independent support _ though still not proof _ to Head's analysis.
</P>
<P>
   All of this is good news for those who hope to find signs of
life on Mars. If there was indeed an ocean there, most scientists
think it would only have existed for a brief period just after the
planets were formed _ the time when life is believed to have
originated very rapidly on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   If the same kind of conditions existed on Mars at that time,
some biologists think it would be surprising if life had not begun
there.
</P>
<P>
   And if there was life, Head said in an interview, it is unlikely
that it could have been completely eliminated. An abundance of
evidence that has accumulated in recent years makes it ever more
clear that living organisms are incredibly difficult to eliminate.
They can survive in a much wider range of seemingly destructive
conditions than any biologist would have dared to claim even a few
decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way to autoclave a planet,'' Head said, referring
to the equipment used to kill bacteria and viruses on surgical
instruments. In other words, once life begins, it is almost
impossible to wipe out.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, the signs of a possible ocean are the latest _ but
doubtless not the last _ of the dramatic changes in scientists'
understanding of the red planet being delivered by the Global
Surveyor data. ``It's a different planet,'' said Zuber in an
interview last week.
</P>
<P>
   The detailed information being sent back now, she said, make
this a time of great excitement for scientists who have been
studying the geology of Mars. ``It's like Balboa seeing the Pacific
ocean for the first time,'' she said.

Internet the results of biomedical research, so the full text of
their reports would be available at no cost to anyone with a
computer anywhere in the world. By Robert Pear.

   SCI-TUMOR-DRILL (Undated) _ A delicate but destructive machine,
a kind of molecular power drill deployed by tumors to punch their
way through the body's compartments, has been visualized for the
first time by biologists at Sweden's Karolinska Institute. The
power drill exists not for the benefit of tumors, though they
exploit it, but for normal remodeling of the tough walls that
surrounds the body's main organs and tissues. By Nicholas Wade.

   SCI-FINCH-FEEDBACK (Undated) _ Among songbirds, the zebra finch
is a one-hit wonder. It learns a tune in its youth, and then is
condemned to repeat it forever, like an aging pop star on the
oldies circuit. A young zebra finch learns through auditory
feedback, listening to its own sounds and comparing them to a song
in its head until it gets it right. Little has been known about how
a mature finch, a ``closed learner'' (compared to a canary, for
example, which learns new tunes all the time) maintains its song.
But recent studies with deafened adult finches have suggested that
they use feedback as well. By Henry Fountain.

meetings in Chicago last week, NASA Administrator Dan Goldin
announced that he would apply the ``cheaper, faster, better''
philosophy that has revitalized planetary exploration to deeper
studies of the origin and structure of the universe, and challenged
the stargazing community to dream up innovative bold ideas. By John
Noble Wilford.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-STEM-CELLS (Undated) _ A researcher has injected neural stem
cells into the brains of fetal monkeys and found that the stem
cells spread out and evolved into the right kinds of tissue in
various parts of the brain. This is the scenario that stem cell
researchers who envision using these pliable cells to replace
damaged organs have been hoping for. The results are not directly
applicable to humans, since the monkeys were still in a fetal
stage, but they allow the researchers to study how the stem cells
migrate around in the brain and evolve. By Nicholas Wade.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-ESSAY (Undated) _ Medical science can measure most things
these days, but one quantity remains eternally, enragingly
imprecise: how long doctors should take to do their work. The
single feat dangling permanently out of reach of the biomedical
revolution seems to be how to make the whole magnificent enterprise
run on time. By Abigail Zuger.

<P>
   Q. How high do the various flying creatures (birds, bats, bugs)
fly?
</P>
<P>
   J.R., Hopkinton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(begin ital) The jet above the Ivory Coast
</P>
<P>
   Was seven miles high
</P>
<P>
   As the Rupell's Griffon Vulture rode
</P>
<P>
   the thermals in the sky.
</P>
<P>
   The plane collided with the bird
</P>
<P>
   The vulture was no more
</P>
<P>
   But now we know how high they go
</P>
<P>
   The heights to which birds soar. (end ital)
</P>
<P>
   A. And then there was mountain climber L.W. Swan, who heard the
barheaded goose at 28,000 feet on the Himalayan peak Mt. Makalu. Or
the alpine chough (as in that was one tough bird) that followed a
1924 Mt. Everest expedition up to 26,000 feet scavenging food from
their camp.
</P>
<P>
   But those are the oddities in the avian record books. Common
birds like warblers, thrushes, and shore birds commonly fly at 10
to 20,000 feet, according to Simon Perkins, field ornithologist for
the Massachusetts Audubon Society. But they're not up there just
for the view. They go to those heights to migrate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes too much energy to get up to greater altitudes if
they're only going to come right back down,'' Perkins says. ``At
higher altitudes the air is more stable, which makes for easier
flying. It's worth it for them to do the work to get up into that
stable air for their long migratory flights. It is a trade off
though, because the air is thinner, which requires them to work
harder.''
</P>
<P>
   But birds are such efficient fliers, he says, that they use very
little oxygen, so even the oxygen-poor air at higher altitudes has
enough to keep them going. Many birds migrate at night, Perkins
adds, because night air is more stable than daytime air being
warmed and stirred up by the heat of the sun.
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital) The free-tailed bat of Mexico
</P>
<P>
   spends summer nights quite high.
</P>
<P>
   In search of buggy dinners
</P>
<P>
   10,000 feet up in the sky. (end ital)
</P>
<P>
   Tom Kunz of Boston University, a Professor of Biology and
world-renowned expert on the 1,000 species of Chiroptera, (bats
make up one quarter of all mammals) is about to head to the 15
caves in southern Texas that each house between seven and 20
million Mexican free-tailed bats. He says radar has seen these
flying mammals at 10,000 feet feeding on insects carried that high
by thermal air currents.
</P>
<P>
   Kunz says stray bats have been at higher altitudes including
some specimens found 16,000 feet up in the Andes mountains.
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital) Cold-blooded bugs that flap their wings
</P>
<P>
   Need warmish air to fly
</P>
<P>
   Without it they will crash right down
</P>
<P>
   and some will even die.
</P>
<P>
   The chill above 6000 feet
</P>
<P>
   Is just too cold to take
</P>
<P>
   To try and fly much higher
</P>
<P>
   Is a flying bug's mistake. (end ital)
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Elson Shields, Entomologist at Cornell University, uses
radio controlled planes towing nets to collect bugs at various
altitudes. He says they need air that's at least 50 degrees
Fahrenheit to warm them enough so they can use the muscles that
keep their wings extended. Cooler than that and bugs can't even
float along like a glider. The wings retract and down they come.
Shields says 6,000 feet is the highest anyone has ever found bugs
buzzing around.
</P>
<P>
   Of course insects reach much greater heights. Non-flying species
like spiders and caterpillar larvae fly by spinning long silk
strands that are picked up in the wind and carry the little
creatures like parasails. Strong updrafts can carry them miles
high. In some cases, they freeze to death. Sometimes they come back
down and thaw out just in time. Shields says their light weight and
strong exoskeleton that forms the outer shell of their bodies
protect them from death after falling from such altitudes.
</P>
<P>
   Shields says that many winged insects are experts at using the
wind to help them fly. One fascinating example is the potato leaf
hopper, a bug just one sixteenth of an inch long, that migrates
between Georgia and New York. It apparently can sense changes in
barometric pressure that occur at the beginning of stormy weather.
The tiny leaf hoppers launch themselves into the storm front and
can make their thousand-mile journey flapping along with the help
of hundred mile an hour winds in just 36 hours.

BECAUSE OF GEARAN'S TENACITY, PEACE CORPS IS THRIVING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Best to start on a bipartisan note about a man who
made it in the big leagues without once checking his principles at
the door.
</P>
<P>
   Largely because of Mark Gearan's vision and tenacity, the Peace
Corps, one of the best ideas of post-'50s America, is in the
process of getting ginned up by a Republican Congress under a
Democratic president to a level of activity not seen in more than a
generation.
</P>
<P>
   Ten thousand dedicated people will be serving abroad three years
from now, which is fabulous news for a great many needy nations,
including new partners Jordan, Bangladesh, and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   It is also fabulous news for the United States, whose superpower
status demands good works. And fabulous news for those mostly young
Americans (as well as a growing number of over-50 volunteers) who
are quietly reviving national service as a worthy pursuit.
</P>
<P>
   But it is also an eloquent tribute to the work of one person who
has never been quite what he seems to be, and who has managed at 42
to do a lot more than put fresh life into a vital program. Included
in that is helping build a Democratic Party capable of governing
the country with new ideas. The scouting report says ``great guy,
everybody loves him, plays a mean piano, selfless, decent, and
super-smart.'' That's not half of it.
</P>
<P>
   All over most of Washington last week _ in the middle of Kosovo
_ people were buzzing about something else, word that Gearan would
stop running the Peace Corps this summer to take over the
presidency of Hobart and William Smith Colleges, two smaller-school
gems in upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   Washington is a tough town; departures are routine and rarely
noted. But this was different, a widespread murmuring of delight at
Gearan's good fortune, true sadness that he's moving, and more than
a little quiet confidence that he will be a Cabinet secretary
someday.
</P>
<P>
   The buzz was on Capitol Hill, among the Republican authorizers
and appropiators who built the hoops Gearan jumped through to win
his campaign for an expanded Peace Corps, as well as a new
operation using experienced volunteers in humanitarian crisis
situations.
</P>
<P>
   And, less surprising, it included President Clinton and his
wife, Vice President Gore and his wife, the current and former
secretaries of state, every domestic policy official of consequence
in the administration, and everybody who did anything or knows
anything of consequence about presidential politics over the last
three cycles.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a resume; it's an instructive life, and a good place
to begin is in the middle. It's the late fall of 1991 at Georgetown
University and Governor Bill Clinton is making the first of three
lengthy, complex policy speeches about a different kind of
Democratic agenda. Only a few people are with him, most notably Al
From of the centrist Democratic Leadership Council, which Clinton
had headed; also in the entourage was Gearan, then in his third
year of running the Democratic Governors Association, another early
Clinton power and networking center.
</P>
<P>
   In the crafting of what would become a successful and popular
domestic policy, they were, at the outset, almost the symbolic yin
and yang of opportunity and responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Gearan already had rich experience: Harvard University,
Representative Robert Drinan's fourth reelection campaign, a year
in the journalism racket, then a chance in Washington with former
Iowa Representative Berkley Biddell, then a bigger chance with
Governor Michael Dukakis.
</P>
<P>
   In running the federal office in Massachusetts and then as a
senior aide in Dukakis's star-crossed presidential campaign, Gearan
helped generate ideas that foreshadowed the Clinton presidency.
Then in '92, he helped make a president, staffed the selection of
Al Gore, ran Gore's campaign, and then staffed Clinton's
transition. The White House was chaos for two years, but Gearan's
office was an island of sanity and never falsehood.
</P>
<P>
   For those surprised that he went on to be arguably the most
important director of the Peace Corps since Sargent Shriver
himself, the image had been ``nice, quiet staff guy.'' And it was
always wrong, as his very proud mom is happy to explain.
</P>
<P>
   Gearan lost his dad, the principal of Gardner High, when he was
only 12. Martha Gearan says her youngest was devastated but never
lost his bearings and was never afraid to tackle hard things. But
he always did so quietly. She knew he was applying to Boston
College, but didn't find out he had filled out an application to
Harvard until he told her. When she drove him to Cambridge for his
interview, she worried that he didn't have a briefcase like most of
the other kids. He told her not to worry, and I doubt she has
since.
</P>
<P>
   Washington may be a tough town and a tough business, but for
those not afraid to be quixotic, the Mark Gearans reward your faith
every day.

<P>
   Tom tripped over an untied shoelace, fell into a closet that
should have been closed and broke his arm when he landed on a
shelf.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth slipped going up the poorly lighted stairs in her home, hit
her head on an upper rung and needed four stitches to close the
wound in her scalp.
</P>
<P>
   Betty was near the bottom during a mountain hike when her
sneaker-clad foot slipped on a wet rock and she fell, breaking her
wrist.
</P>
<P>
   All three were over 50 when they fell and all three were lucky
that the injuries they sustained were not considerably worse. Falls
among older people and the resulting injuries that can cause
long-term disability and even death are rising in epidemic fashion.
</P>
<P>
   In a study published last month in The Journal of the American
Medical Association, Finnish researchers documented an alarming
increase in the number and incidence of falls sustained by people
over 50 since 1970.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Finns over 50 the number of falls nearly quadrupled _
from 5,622 in 1970 to 21,574 in 1995, and the rate of falls per
100,000 population nearly tripled. But even when the researchers
took the increasing age of the population into account, the risk of
falling had more than doubled for men and women.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Finnish researchers and experts here say the problem is
no different in the United States and Britain. They attribute the
rise in falls and costly fall-related injuries to a number of
factors, many of which are preventable.
</P>
<P>
   Older people are more likely to have health problems, including
physical impairments, and more likely to be taking multiple
medications that can impair balance, reaction time, strength or
vision.
</P>
<P>
   Relatively few older people do the kinds of exercises that help
to reduce age-related declines in muscle strength and balance.
</P>
<P>
   And, according to a new Yale study, relatively few homes,
including housing for the elderly, have accommodations that can
mitigate the risk of falling.
</P>
<P>
   People 72 or older may find their own homes hazardous, according
to findings by Dr. Thomas M. Gill and colleagues at the Yale School
of Medicine published in April in The American Journal of Public
Health. The school's Program on Aging conducted a study of 1,000
people ages 72 and older living in and around New Haven in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The participants, 72 percent of them women and 69 percent of
whom were living alone, were members of Project Safety, a study
financed by the National Institute on Aging designed to assess
factors that influence the day-to-day functioning of older people.
</P>
<P>
   Each participant's home was examined for the presence of 20
potential environmental hazards, and virtually all residences,
including housing for the elderly, were found to contain one or
more conditions that could result in disabling accidents.
</P>
<P>
   The most dangerous part of the house, the study revealed, was
the floor in living rooms, bedrooms and hallways. In nearly 80
percent of homes the floor was a minefield of trip hazards: loose
throw rugs, runners and mats; curled carpet edges; electrical cords
and other small objects in pathways, and uncarpeted, slippery
floors, among them.
</P>
<P>
   Stairways presented the second most common trouble zone. Night
lights were missing in more than two-thirds of homes, and even in
daylight, lighting was often poor. In 20 percent of homes, light
switches were lacking at the top and bottom of stairways.
</P>
<P>
   Other hazards included lack of a sturdy handrail that extended
the full length of the stairway, uneven steps (some higher, lower
or narrower than others) and steps in need of repair.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The bathroom was found to be the most dangerous room. Two or
more hazards were found in 59 percent of bathrooms. More than 60
percent lacked grab bars in the tub or shower, about the only
hazard that was not found in housing for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Other common hazards included loose mats, slippery tubs and
showers lacking nonskid mats or abrasive strips, poor lighting and
toilets that were wobbly or too low to allow older people to rise
from them safely. The living room was second most dangerous, with
42 percent having two or more hazards, mostly trip hazards.
</P>
<P>
   Kitchens came next, with 40 percent having two or more hazards.
Light switches were hard to find in more than two-thirds of
kitchens, especially in the dark, and trip hazards were found on
nearly a third of kitchen floors.
</P>
<P>
   Other kitchen hazards included unstable step stools, poor
lighting and storage of frequently used objects in places that
required reaching up or bending over. Living rooms were next with
dim lighting, shadows or glare and chairs that were too low to get
out of easily, along with many floor hazards.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty percent of falls occur at home, and about a quarter of all
falls result from hazards like slippery or wet surfaces, poor
lighting, inadequate footwear and cluttered pathways in a home. To
help avoid these kinds of falls, Dr. Mary Tinette, director of
Yale's Program on Aging, suggests two proven measures.
</P>
<P>
   One involves exercises that increase physical strength and
balance. Strength training, like lifts with hand and leg weights,
has grown in popularity among older people. These exercises have
two benefits: they increase people's physical strength, thus
decreasing their chances of falling, and they increase bone mass so
that if a fall should occur, the risk of fracture is reduced.
Muscle strength is important to nearly every activity of daily
living, from getting out of the bed to climbing stairs.
</P>
<P>
   Tai chi has been demonstrated by osteoporosis researchers at the
Hospital for Special Surgery in New York to improve balance and
decrease the risk of falls in older people.
</P>
<P>
   Another important measure for maintaining balance is avoiding
side effects like dizziness and vision impairment caused by
medications. Those most at risk of falls take four or more
medications. Certain drugs, for example some drugs used to treat
high blood pressure or heart ailments, can cause dizziness, central
nervous system depression and movement disorders that increase the
risk of falls.
</P>
<P>
   Tinette suggests that people discuss with their physicians the
possibility of reducing the number of drugs taken and keeping
dosages to the minimum necessary to control the ailment. Effective
alternative medications can sometimes be prescribed to avoid the
side effects that make falls more likely.
</P>
<P>
   The Finnish researchers also attributed the increase in falls
among the older people to an increase in alcohol consumption and
the use of psychotropic drugs. Older people are more susceptible to
the adverse effects of mind-altering chemicals; an amount of
alcohol that was handled well at 40 may become a serious hazard at
60.
</P>
<P>
   The fall-prevention program of the American Academy of
Orthopaedic Surgeons suggests a number of ways to help the elderly
stay on their feet.
</P>
<P>
   _ Install sturdy hand rails on all stairways and grab bars in
the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cover stairs with tightly woven carpet or nonslip treads.
</P>
<P>
   _ Avoid climbing and reaching up to high shelves.
</P>
<P>
   _ Use a step stool with handrails
</P>
<P>
   _ Do not wax floors and always clean up spills as soon as they
happen.
</P>
<P>
   _ Wear low-heeled shoes with nonskid soles. Avoid thick, heavy
soles and keep laces tied so that the shoes fit snugly.
</P>
<P>
   _ Try not to use a bed that is too high, and before getting out
of bed, sit on the edge for a few minutes to be sure you are not
dizzy.
</P>
<P>

business-size envelope to Don't Let a Fall Be Your Last Trip,

<P>
   The methodology for choosing one's friends is always a complex
business, but one of my enduring criteria, along with decency and
humor, is that they exhibit a literary curiosity. This is not
snobbish: It can mean anything from an amused regard for the
semiotic clues in ``The X-Files'' (1066 on a hotel room door!) to
an appreciation of urban billboards; just as often, the trait
presents as a fondness for good gumshoe or for Edith Wharton. The
point is that their curiosity ignites my own, and some ensuing
attention is paid to the narrative thread that unites us all.
</P>
<P>
   Thus it was that my recent innocent question to two eminently
trustworthy bibliophiles _ ``What are you reading?'' _ launched
wonderful stream-of-consciousness sojourns with each of them. One
half-apologized that he was immersed in ``village novels,'' which
sent us from Barbara Pym to Thomas Hardy to Virginia Woolf, whose
protagonist in ``The Years'' exhibits a healthy fear of clipped
roses and rural clergymen. Next came the sigh from a friend with
one foot in the 19th century, who conceded that, these days, he was
``doing time'' with contemporary fiction. ``I'm thinking of going
toward Dickens, actually,'' he said, his voice lighting up. ``I'm
interested in seeing if he's as flat as I remember. I don't mean
that in a bad way.''
</P>
<P>
   What he meant, of course, was that in Dickens plot is
everything; what I liked about his comment was that its
eccentricity made me stretch. And stretching is one of the
requisite pleasures of reading in the summer, when we foster the
illusion that there is more time to read _ though there is, in
fact, quite a bit less. Instead there is grass to mow, rivers to
row, gardens to govern. But still we beat on toward the promise of
time's expanding chambers: all those unread novels and untraveled
literary paths, giving us, like the ever-hopeful Gatsby, our blue
lawns and green light.
</P>
<P>
   Many twinklings on the horizon this summer; certainly the most
neon among them is the much-buzzed ``Turn of the Century,'' Kurt
Andersen's wickedly funny satire of New York manners set the day
after tomorrow, in the year 2000 _ a world where cell phones and
moral consciences continue to shrink, but where the latte from
Starbucks is still very, very venti. Mischief-makers Christopher
Buckley and Julian Barnes have focused their acerbic sights on,
respectively, Washington, D.C., (``Little Green Men'') and that
other sceptred isle (``England, England''); Salman Rushdie, whose
inimitable humor is too often lost in the excesses of his
imagination, has gone global-rock 'n' roll in ``The Ground Beneath
Her Feet.''
</P>
<P>
   The most literary ado of the season is being made about Ralph
Ellison's ``Juneteenth,'' to be published this week; the great
manuscript _ some four decades in progress, and still uncompleted
at Ellison's death in 1994 _ has been whittled to less than a third
its original size. Raising even more questions about posthumous
publication will be Scribner's release of Ernest Hemingway's ``True
at First Light'' later this month; the fictional memoir (ridiculous
term) is the last of the unpublished literary estate, and perhaps
ought to have stayed that way. If nothing else, these contributions
might entice readers to return to Ellison's only other novel,
``Invisible Man,'' or to any of Hemingway's finest work _ this
year, for me, it was ``A Farewell to Arms.''
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to war, which brings us to Ward Just, who in ``A
Dangerous Friend'' has delivered a hauntingly, melancholy Saigon
novel that the narrator insists is not a war story. No matter; as
Just, a former war correspondent turned novelist, has continually
implied, the truth never lies in mere truths. Sebastian Faulks
(whose 1996 bestseller about the First World War, ``Birdsong,'' is
on my why-haven't-I-read-this? list) has turned to the Second World
War in the recently released ``Charlotte Gray.'' Fellow British
writer Pat Barker, whose critical reputation was ensured with her
World War I ``Regeneration'' trilogy, has gone back to the domestic
novel with ``Another World,'' but the old soldier at its center _
clinging to and trapped by his memories of combat _ is the
cornerstone of the book.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart O'Nan, who in previous novels has written about World
War II (``A World Away'') and Vietnam (``The Names of the Dead''),
has frighteningly captured a plague in small-town, 19th-century
Wisconsin in the tersely realized ``A Prayer for the Dying.''
Equally scary but, one must assume, less literary will be Thomas
Harris's forthcoming ``Hannibal,'' the ``Silence of the Lambs''
sequel for which Lecter lovers are no doubt hungering. The summer's
stock of thrillers seems as inviting as it's been in years, with
contributions from John Katzenbach (``Hart's War''), Patricia
Cornwell's ``Black Notice'' (a Kay Scarpetta novel coming next
month), John le Carre's respectably pin-striped ``Single &AMP;
Single,'' and Martin Cruz Smith's latest ``Gorky Park''
installment, ``Havana Bay.''
</P>
<P>
   If last June's heat-wave madness award went to ``Bridget Jones's
Diary,'' the publicity for which was as overblown as an inflatable
dragon, this year's bumper crop of babe fiction alleges almost as
much but delivers even less. The most touted among this dubious
harvest are American Melissa Bank's debut collection, ``Girls'
Guide to Hunting and Fishing,'' which is graceful but forgettable,
and British writer Sue Margolis's ``Neurotica,'' which is shrill.
Turn instead to Julie Hecht's hilarious collection from 1997, ``Do
the Windows Open?,'' or to Lorrie Moore's stunning 1998 stories,
``Birds of America.''
</P>
<P>
   This year's finest work in American fiction has come in the
short story, a form that is lovingly honored in Houghton Mifflin's
premier one-volume edition, ``The Best American Short Stories of
the Century.'' Selected by John Updike and series editor Katrina
Kenison, the 55 stories present a remarkable portrait of America
since 1915 (the series' inception); they also compose a revealing
tribute to the tenets of short fiction as it has changed over the
decades. Two of the writers honored therein, Annie Proulx and Gish
Jen, are showcased in their own collections this spring: Proulx's
indelibly tough Wyoming stories in ``Close Range,'' and Jen's
graciously intelligent ``Who's Irish?''. Other notable literary
collections include Christopher Tilghman's ``The Way People Run''
and Nathan Englander's taut debut stories, ``For the Relief of
Unbearable Urges''; those who like their prose hard-edged will find
that quality in Thom Jones's ``Sonny Liston Was a Friend of Mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Lots of roaming the natural world this spring: In ``Bone by
Bone,'' Peter Matthieson completes his Watson trilogy, set in the
Florida Everglades. David Guterson, returning to the Washington
state he so carefully evoked in ``Snow Falling on Cedars,''
captures the smaller world of a dying man in ``East of the
Mountains.'' Two novels attempt to inhabit the perspective of other
mammals, with mixed results. Paul Auster's ``Timbuktu'' follows
around a faithful dog named Mr. Bones whose owner has died, but the
novel reads like an anthropomorphic, video-cam day trip. In ``The
White Bone,'' with an imagined society of African elephants,
Barbara Gowdy fares somewhat better _ she doesn't make her animals
silly extensions of human fancy, like Auster, but you may have
trouble keeping all the names straight.
</P>
<P>
   Now, back to that village fiction where we began: the perfect
scaffolding, after all, for order and reason and civilization,
which means that anything might happen within those county lines,
and often does. This literary license, wherein the domestic houses
the unruly, has been a mainstay for writers from Jane Austen to
William Trevor; the tradition is valiantly upheld this season in
Penelope Lively's ``Spiderweb,'' a beautifully crafted novel based
in Somerset. For those summer readers for whom even a small
township in the west of England seems a little, well, modern, I
refer you to that sublime architecture of village fiction, George
Eliot's ``Middlemarch.'' Like Thoreau wandering Concord, you may
travel widely there without ever leaving home.
</P>
<P>
   And to a friend who eschews the contemporary for the glory days
of Eliot and English order, I might also mention Michael
Cunningham's homage to Virginia Woolf in his 1998 novel, ``The
Hours.'' Which will then entice you to turn to Woolf's ``Mrs.
Dalloway,'' which is, in fact, one of the superior camouflage acts
in literary history: a war novel posing as a domestic one.

WHO'S IRISH? 
By Gish Jen. Knopf. 
208 pp. $22. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nobody's having more fun with American diversity than Gish Jen.
Even using the word diversity does an injustice to her, since her
fiction has none of the reverence and political correctness usually
associated with it. Jen is the writer whose 1996 novel ``Mona in
the Promised Land,'' her second, tells the story of a single-minded
Chinese-American teen who converts to Judaism, matzo balls and all.
On the book jacket: a bagel superimposed over a bowl of won-ton
soup. And Jen is the writer who begins her new collection of
stories, ``Who's Irish?'', with the portrait of a miffed Chinese
immigrant whose daughter and Irish son-in-law deliver therapy-era
clunkers like, ``I'm not telling you what to do. . . . I'm telling
you how I feel.''
</P>
<P>
   It would all be about culture clash and the problems of
assimilation, except that Jen is too good-humored and ambitious to
wrestle with moral judgment. One of the greatest charms of her
fiction is her position as a bemused chronicler _ of the way things
are in this crazy mishmash of an America, of the power and the
limitations of family roots, and, most important, of the hugely
comic potential in human nature. For the most part, no matter how
complicated or ``sensitive'' the situation _ a Chinese-American
woman mistaken for Japanese by a friend, a Chinese immigrant
awkwardly romancing the American country-club set _ Jen is there to
attach a smirk to the confusion. She's like the loving parent to
her characters as they go through their identity crises.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's Irish?'' is a strong addition to her body of work, which
in addition to ``Mona in the Promised Land'' includes ``Typical
American,'' a novel about three immigrants caught in the promise of
1950s America. The collection is mostly peopled with Asian
immigrants and their American-born children, particularly those who
struggle with the old-world thinking of their parents. Recalling
his school experience, a Japanese-American man recalls, ``The ones
with immigrant parents in particular seemed to do nothing but
perform, perform, only to be pronounced still lacking.'' In
``House, House, Home,'' the heroine is a Chinese-American woman who
isn't interested in pursuing her parents' American Dream of money,
business, and material reward. She wants to be an artist, and
marries an unconventional art teacher more than twice her age to
rid herself of any remnant of immigrant concerns with social
acceptance. But the marriage falters. ``Could an elective outsider
ever know what it was like to be the other kind of outsider?'' she
wonders.
</P>
<P>
   The book has eight stories, all of them good. Two contain
characters and the nostalgic tone from ``Mona in the Promised
Land,'' and two are long, more serious, and beautifully fleshed
out. The best of the long stories is ``Duncan in China,'' with a
momentous hike up the mountain of Tai Shan that brings to mind
nothing less than the famous muddle of E. M. Forster's ``Passage to
India.'' Duncan is an aimless Chinese-American who moves to China
to find himself, and to avoid his mother's deification of a
wealthy, BMW-driving brother. But when he is face to face with the
conditions in China, and with a poverty-stricken cousin who
suffered through the Cultural Revolution, he realizes just how
American he is. After landing in Shandong, Duncan sees that ``the
China of the early 1980s had more to do with eating melon seeds
around a coal heater the size of a bread box than about Sung
dynasty porcelain.'' Naturally, the story is so much richer than
its summarization, and a few of the dialogue exchanges, ridden with
misunderstanding, are models of nuance.
</P>
<P>
   While both her novels contain serious drama, with incidents of
family violence and racial discrimination, a redemptive lightness
almost always hovers close by. They are, ultimately, comedies. One
of the revelations of ``Who's Irish?'' is Jen's ability to portray
hopelessness without falling back on a sweet moment. Two of the
stories here, ``Chin'' and ``Birthmates,'' are fairly unrelenting
in their sadness. ``Birthmates,'' which recently earned its way
into ``Best American Short Stories of the Century,'' is a
heartbreaking look at Art Woo, a failing businessman in the
computer industry. An emotionally stunted man who could not help
his ex-wife grieve for their 4 1/2-month-old fetus, Art finds
himself staying at a welfare hotel during a computer conference,
slipping further than ever from the American Dream. A cold bath of
a story, ``Birthmates'' ends with an unforgettably powerful image.
</P>
<P>
   But even in these heavy moments, Jen never lets her tales slip
into the realm of lesson. Her imagination is far too lively for
that. First and foremost, her fiction is about her characters, and
the amusing, and sometimes, tragic, ways they find out who they are
in American society. Never relying on political correctness _ or
the backlash against it _ for her ballast, Jen deals with the
realities, and not the theories, of living in this country.

FILLING UP THE BOOKBAG FOR A MURDEROUS SUMMER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBIN W. WINKS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As spring turns into summer, I always find myself looking for
mystery and detective novels that combine my desire for a strong
sense of place (no doubt because the scent of faraway places with
strange-sounding names is in the air) with a story of our days;
escape combined with compelling immediacy. Winter is a single malt
and a contemplative view of crime; fall is all nostalgia and a
willingness to venture into the past; high summer is short reads
between quick dips. But the transition from spring to early summer
is full of the promise of places to come and the memory of events
just told.
</P>
<P>
   In such a mood I ventured in to Pamela Thomas-Graham's ``Blue
Blood'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $23). Thomas-Graham's first Ivy League
mystery, ``A Darker Shade of Crimson,'' was set at Harvard; now she
has come to Yale, and no doubt she will move on to the Big Green of
Dartmouth. But for the nonce she has chosen to tell us the tale of
a controversial Yale Law School professor, impossibly young and
improbably beautiful, who is found on a deserted New Haven street
dead of multiple stab wounds. A dean of a college is suspected of
the crime, and 30-year-old African-American economics professor
Nikki Chase hurries down from Cambridge to solve the crime. The
plot is remarkably silly, the writing flat, and though
Thomas-Graham has clearly done some eyeball research on the Yale
campus, she gets a good bit wrong (including, it appears, believing
that a college at Yale is overseen by a dean, rather than a master
_ a confusion I take personally, having once been the latter and
never the former). There is a good amount of aimless activity
through which Chase solves the crime ahead of the police
(naturally) and is confronted by the mad murderer high in Harkness
Tower, the symbol of the Yale campus. I enjoyed the book, since
it's fun to see one's own neighborhood used, or misused, but the
enterprise also struck me as in bad taste and quite graceless.
Dartmouth beware.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Dana Stabenow keeps on getting better. All
her books tell us about Kate Shugak, a lively feminist in Alaska,
and in ``Hunter's Moon'' (Putnam, $23.95), Kate and a friend have
been hired to guide some German computer executives into the
wilderness in search of big game. Soon they are the game, and then
Kate is, too, as Stabenow replays variants on ``And Then There Were
None,'' the Christie classic. The Germans are objectionable and
stupid, Alaska is its always appealing self, and Kate's hunt pulls
us into summer splendidly.
</P>
<P>
   James Thayer's ``Terminal Event'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $25) is a
riveting look at an airplane crash that leaves no survivors. Jon
Durant, a former National Transportation Safety Board investigator,
invites himself into the investigation because his wife was among
those killed. Durant needs to believe a bomber destroyed the plane,
while primary investigators are inclined to blame pilot error.
Thayer takes us step-by-step through the complex and technical
detail of such an investigation without putting a foot wrong; a
mountainside in the state of Washington comes alive in painstaking,
compelling detail. This is, I suspect, going to be the best book of
the summer, but it isn't for reading on the plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``Muscle Memory'' by William C. Tapply (St. Martin's, $23.95)
will be fine for the plane. Brady Coyne, a Boston lawyer who keeps
getting drawn into criminal investigations, manages to do what he
is actually supposed to do this time, to help a former professional
basketball player handle a divorce suit. The player's wife, who is
demanding a divorce for reasons he claims to be unable to grasp, is
found murdered, and Coyne soon discovers that just about everybody
is lying to him. The alert reader will see the solution to all this
dishonesty well before Coyne does, but it's rather nice to be more
intelligent than a lawyer for a change, and Tapply tells a good
story.
</P>
<P>
   So does K. C. Constantine, whose ``Blood Mud'' (Mysterious
Press, $23) brings Mario Balzic _ retired as police chief of
Rocksburg, Pa. _ back into action as a private cop. The dialogue is
as true (and coarse) as ever; the sense of a country living on the
edge, next to despair but not quite there yet, is as sharp as ever;
and anyone who has admired Constantine in the past will be happy to
see him fully back in command. If you're not familiar with him,
this book is a good chance to make Balzic's acquaintance. Do it
now, before too much cholesterol and too many tall glasses of
Chardonnay do him in.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the book that will stay with me the longest is Tom
Nolan's ``Ross Macdonald: A Biography'' (Scribner, $32), which
enters a fairly crowded field and more than holds its own. Strictly
as biography, Nolan's is the best we have on Macdonald: full of
rich, relevant details, careful, well told, compassionate without
being reverential. One wonders why the publisher wanted a two-page
introduction by Sue Grafton. It adds nothing, and this study
requires no boosting, just plain reading and respect. Nolan reviews
mystery fiction, he knows what a reader will need, and he ushers
those of us who read this kind of stuff all year long into the
inner thoughts of a writer who was a man for all seasons.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PLAINSBORO, N.J. _ In its heyday it was a palace among physics
laboratories, with an enviably fat budget, ample support staff and
the prestige that comes to research institutions working at the
cutting edge in solving global problems. But today, the Princeton
Plasma Physics Laboratory, still a leader in hydrogen fusion
research, is so short of cash that it can no longer afford even a
receptionist.
</P>
<P>
   However, a dry spell of discouragements and spending cuts for
fusion research may be ending. With their backs to a financial
wall, specialists in the field are banding together to pursue the
elusive goal of harnessing thermonuclear fusion, the process that
drives the sun and hydrogen bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders in the field say the new spirit calls for lean,
selective financing of small-scale experiments as well as the large
ones that have dominated the field's history, increased cooperation
between long-standing competitors, and a lot of patience.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of hydrogen fusion, the joining together of hydrogen
nuclei to produce useful energy, have suffered too many
frustrations over the years to hope for too much too soon. Fusion
energy will not come tomorrow. But it could become a reality in the
mid-21st century, believers say, and slow the carbon dioxide
pollution of the atmosphere by the burning of fossil fuels _ a
problem that may be leading to disastrous global warming.
</P>
<P>
   Pressed by tight budgetary constraints imposed by Congress,
competing fusion laboratories have begun sharing and coordinating
their research to a greater extent than ever and have drafted
guidelines for allocating their limited resources as they would an
investment portfolio, giving major financing to the most promising
projects but gambling some funds for high-risk but potentially
fruitful experiments.
</P>
<P>
   Next month fusion scientists and engineers from around the world
will hold a meeting in Snowmass, Colo., to discuss all the devices
and proposals currently on the table. It will be the first meeting
of its kind, according to its co-chairman, Dr. Michael E. Mauel of
Columbia University, and it signals a growing realization that if
fusion energy is ever to become a reality it will require global
cooperation rather than endless competition between nations and
individual laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   The main obstacle to accelerated research fusion, many
scientists say, is the disincentive created by low fossil fuel
prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now,'' said Dr. Robert J. Goldston, director of the
Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory in New Jersey, ``a bottle of
table water costs more than a bottle of gasoline. But cheap oil
won't last forever, and in any case, the burning of fossil fuels
may be contributing to global warming. Fusion, which could produce
enormous amounts of energy at reasonable cost with only negligible
amounts of radioactive waste and no pollution of the atmosphere,
may be our only practical alternative to fossil fuels.''
</P>
<P>
   No one doubts that hydrogen fusion can be achieved. Huge pulses
of fusion power have already been generated by experimental fusion
reactors in the United States and Europe. The trouble is that until
now, conventional generating plants have had to supply more energy
to kindle a thermonuclear pulse than the pulse itself produces.
</P>
<P>
   No one has yet been able to squeeze thermonuclear fuel tightly
enough and long enough to ignite a self-sustaining fusion reaction.
</P>
<P>
   In the sun, energy is produced when hydrogen nuclei fuse to
produce helium, a heavier element. But for hydrogen nuclei to
overcome their mutual electrostatic repulsion and get close enough
to fuse, they must have very high velocities, that is to say, they
must be very, very hot.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of different reactor designs have been built, tested and
abandoned over the years, most of which belong to one of two main
categories: magnetic confinement, the squeezing of plasma by
magnetic fields; and inertial confinement, the squeezing of hot gas
by the implosion of miniature hydrogen bombs.
</P>
<P>
   A magnetic confinement device uses powerful interlocked magnetic
fields to contain and compress hot, electrically charged plasma (a
kind of gas) within a vacuum chamber. The plasma must never touch
the solid walls of its container; otherwise, it instantly loses its
heat and can never be coaxed into undergoing fusion. Everything
depends on keeping the plasma's magnetic bottle tightly stoppered,
which is no easy task.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the stars of magnetic fusion experiments have been
devices called tokamaks. One of the largest and most successful of
these machines was the Princeton laboratory's big Tokamak Fusion
Test Reactor, which in 1994 produced a record-breaking pulse of
10.7 million watts of fusion power. It was shut down two years ago
for lack of money.
</P>
<P>
   The device's lineage goes back to the early 1950s, when the
Soviet scientists Andrei Sakharov and Igor Tamm proposed the design
and named it tokamak _ the Russian acronym for ``toroidal magnetic
chamber'' _ a doughnut-shaped machine that compresses fusion fuel
magnetically.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, however, the seemingly simple tokamak idea proved to
conceal endless pitfalls and complications, and despite great
progress in understanding the behavior of plasmas, commercial
fusion power by magnetic confinement is still only a dream.
</P>
<P>
   A competing approach to fusion is inertial confinement, in which
hydrogen bombs the size of small BB pellets would be detonated in a
target chamber, transferring their energy to a metal ``blanket.''
</P>
<P>
   In an inertial confinement reactor, each hydrogen-filled pellet
would be the target of batteries of high-powered lasers, particle
beams or X-rays. A blast of this radiation would vaporize the
plastic outer layer of the tiny fusion pellet. The resulting
implosion would drive the plasma formed from the vaporized pellet
inward on itself, compressing and heating the fusion fuel inside it
until a thermonuclear explosion occurs.
</P>
<P>
   The thermonuclear pop of each pellet, yielding energy equivalent
to the blast of 100 pounds of TNT, could simulate a thermonuclear
weapon explosion _ a similarity that has important implications for
both science and thermonuclear weapons programs. The Lawrence
Livermore Laboratory in California is a leader in this approach to
fusion.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Livermore is a crucial player in the Science-Based Stockpile
Stewardship and Management Program, which monitors the health of
the nation's nuclear weapons. Fusion experiments using the
gargantuan laser array Livermore is building as the National
Ignition Facility will help the laboratory evaluate the nuclear
stockpile without having to detonate nuclear explosions banned by
treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Because their research has both scientific and military
purposes, Livermore and the other two weapons laboratories
supported by the Department of Energy, Sandia and Los Alamos
National Laboratories, receive financing for both categories of
research. This makes them richer than laboratories like the
Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory, which receive only science
financing.
</P>
<P>
   Competition for funding has always been a source of friction
between rival partisans of magnetic and inertial fusion, and the
sharing of ideas, experimental data and equipment was often
minimal. Experiments by rival camps sometimes wastefully duplicated
research.
</P>
<P>
   But a new spirit of closer cooperation has developed. In an
interview, Mauel, a Columbia University fusion expert, praised
leaders of the magnetic and inertial confinement fields for healing
many of their long-standing differences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. E. Michael Campbell, the laser director at Livermore, and
Rob Goldston, the Princeton director, are doing a wonderful job
bringing us all together as a team,'' Mauel said. ``As a
co-chairman of the big fusion meeting we're holding in Snowmass
next month, I know that there's still competition among us. But
we're working together more than we used to.''
</P>
<P>
   A center of interest in the fusion race is the National Ignition
Facility that Livermore is building _ a $1.2 billion array of 192
lasers packed into a building that could contain a football
stadium. When it begins operating in 2003, its scientists hope that
progress toward sustained power-producing fusion will be greatly
accelerated.
</P>
<P>
   At Princeton, financing will remain much less lavish. The
laboratory will have to spend $48 million in the next three years
just to demolish its decommissioned Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor,
which still contains traces of the radioactive tritium it used as
fuel. The big machine's reaction chamber will be filled with
concrete and then sawed into pieces for disposal, safely isolating
the tritium until it decays harmlessly.
</P>
<P>
   At its peak in the 1980s, the Princeton center employed about
1,300 people. Today it has about 400.
</P>
<P>
   But the laboratory has retained most of its senior scientists
and is still doing important experiments.
</P>
<P>
   Goldston and his colleagues believe magnetic fusion research in
the United States will need a bit more than $300 million a year to
regain momentum _ a substantial increase from its present level of
$223 million. At its peak, magnetic confinement research received
as much as $370 million.
</P>
<P>
   But fusion physicists are learning to live within tight budgets.
</P>
<P>
   In the spirit of no-frills research that has followed the
closing of its big tokamak, Princeton has already completed a much
more modest fusion reactor called a spherical tokamak, which
resembles an apple with a thin core rather than a doughnut. The
$23.8 million machine incorporates a highly efficient magnetic
confinement system and will begin full operation in August. (By
comparison, Princeton's big tokamak shut down two years ago cost
more than $1.4 billion.)
</P>
<P>
   Other magnetic fusion projects in the United States are under
way at the General Atomics Co. (which operates its big DIII-D
tokamak in San Diego), the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, the Naval
Research Laboratory, the University of Rochester, the University of
Wisconsin, Oak Ridge National Laboratory and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Time and again, however, multimillion-dollar tokamaks,
stellarators, spheromaks, inertial confinement systems and other
devices with unfamiliar names have fallen far short of the
conditions needed to sustain a thermonuclear ``burn'' _ the
continuous joining-together of hydrogen nuclei into helium.
</P>
<P>
   Taxpayers, members of Congress and many scientists outside the
fusion research community have grown weary with the ever-receding
goal and the huge cost of many fusion experiments.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, many of the heady predictions during the early years
of fusion research proved to be wildly overblown. Enthusiasts used
to claim that hydrogen, the most abundant of all substances in the
universe, could power the world cheaply and forever.
</P>
<P>
   However, ordinary hydrogen is not viewed as a fusion fuel that
could be used in the foreseeable future. Commercial reactors of the
near future, if such are built, will almost certainly require fuel
mixtures of two hydrogen isotopes _ deuterium and tritium, not
common hydrogen. Tritium, which is radioactive, is produced only at
great expense from reactors that burn uranium.
</P>
<P>
   Another impediment is that the fusion of deuterium and tritium
can be ignited only at a temperature around 100 million degrees
Celsius (180 million degrees Fahrenheit) after being compressed to
a density 20 times that of lead. These conditions are difficult to
create.
</P>
<P>
   Confining a dollop of super-hot compressed plasma has proved to
be harder than compressing and shaping a blob of jelly using only
rubber bands. Each clever idea of the plasma physicists for solving
this problem has been matched by a new challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1996, federal support for the fusion energy has program
declined by 40 percent, and last year the United States withdrew
from a partnership with Russia, Japan and Europe intended to create
a gigantic fusion research machine _the International Thermonuclear
Experimental Reactor. It was a heavy blow to fusion prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just too expensive,'' Goldston said. ``We simply have
to choose a path consistent with national priorities. It will take
longer, but we'll get there. We must get there.''

VENTURA WRESTLES WITH POLITICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Reading Jesse Ventura's recently published autobiography, ``I
Ain't Got Time to Bleed: Reworking the Body Politic From the Bottom
Up,'' I had the impression that the new governor of Minnesota is
not the figure of fun many think he is. Consider the following:
</P>
<P>
   --He won.
</P>
<P>
   --Some of his ideas are interesting.
</P>
<P>
   --He's bigger than you.
</P>
<P>
   --Anybody Garrison Keillor despises have something going for
him.
</P>
<P>
   In his autobiography, Ventura reveals the secret of his
political success: ``The bottom line is that my opponents were
boring.''
</P>
<P>
   To be boring in America at the end of the 20th century is the
kiss of death. Who would know this better than a former
professional wrestler?
</P>
<P>
   Ventura places himself in a distinguished company of
entertainers who have gone into politics: Ronald Reagan, Sonny
Bono, Fred ``Gopher'' Grandy, among others. He observes, ``There's
a lot about entertainment that translates directly to the kind of
public relations you have to do in public office.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I Ain't Got Time to Bleed'' (the title is a line spoken by the
character he portrayed in the movie ``Predator'') has not been
getting the attention it deserves, which is curious, because it has
just about everything it takes to make a bestseller _ sex,
violence, drunkenness, tragedy, romance, redemption, power,
celebrity names, nods to fate and destiny, and, not least, his
political manifesto. Ventura's controversial proposals to
decriminalize prostitution and drug possession have gotten a lot of
attention, but he also has some interesting ideas about education
and campaign reform, among other issues.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever else it may be, ``I Ain't Got Time to Bleed'' isn't
boring, in contrast to the recent NBC movie ``The Jesse Ventura
Story,'' which presented a G-rated Norman Rockwell version of his
life. If I'm not mistaken _ I was flipping, I admit it _ the TV
movie didn't dwell upon his marijuana and steroid use, his visits
to Nevada brothels, his drinking bouts, and a variety of other
youthful and not-so-youthful high jinks that are recounted with a
mixture of pride and rue in his book. Ventura admits to having sown
vast acres of wild oats, and he did it all long before he was
elected, unlike certain other office holders.
</P>
<P>
   Professional wrestling and politics have a lot more in common
besides what Ventura calls the f-word _ fake. He writes, ``Toughing
it out in the ring against hails of insults and dealing with all
the backstabbing and betrayal and infighting _ what better training
is there for public office?''
</P>
<P>
   There are some major differences. For example, Ventura explains,
``the prime directive of wrestling is to protect your opponent as
you would protect yourself.'' Which means it must be a more
civilized arena than politics, by and large.
</P>
<P>
   It's a little scary to discover how close Ventura came to never
running for office. He'd done a pilot for a TV series called ``Tag
Team'' about two professional wrestlers who become police officers.
The concept for the show originated with a 6-year-old boy, the son
of a writer. Surprisingly, television being what it is, the network
killed it, leaving Ventura at a loose end.
</P>
<P>
   It was fate, he reveals. The show was canceled because he was
destined to become governor. ``I hope I'm not destined to become
president,'' he writes. ``I don't say that with arrogance. . . . I
don't want the presidency. I'll never say never, because you never
know what will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed. You never know.
</P>

ASTRONOMERS URGED TO FOLLOW THEIR STARS 
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Minn., Ill.) (The Science Times) 
(HLW) 
 By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The head of the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration has a message for the country's astronomers: stop
hugging the Hubble Space Telescope.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel S. Goldin, the NASA administrator, certainly meant no
disrespect for the orbiting telescope, regarded by many as the most
successful space project of the decade. Its spectacular pictures
and revealing data from the depths of the universe have stretched
the dimensions of wonder for scientists and the public alike. And
it is still going strong.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, in a June 3 speech to a national meeting of the
American Astronomical Society here, Goldin was exhorting scientists
to think expansively and identify new technologies for spacecraft
and telescopes needed for understanding more about the composition,
evolution, structure and origin of the universe. He called on them
to recommend ``visionary goals that will resonate, that will
excite, that will carry humanity far, far into the future.''
</P>
<P>
   While he made no specific proposals or immediate promises of
increased spending, Goldin offered some ideas to illustrate the
scope of thinking he had in mind. He challenged scientists to
conceive of new techniques to search for life on Earthlike planets
around other stars, and durable, low-cost propulsion systems
capable of sending robots there. He imagined robots the size of
soft-drink cans with software systems mimicking biological
processes, which would be able to adapt to and deal with
unanticipated problems and thus evolve into ``intelligent
interstellar probes.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldin also spoke of deploying into deep space ``gossamer
telescopes'' with mirrors several hundred feet wide (Hubble's is
less than 8 feet) and arrays of widely separated telescopes capable
of coordinated observations for even sharper images of the cosmos.
Other space probes might be able to measure gravitational radiation
from the first microseconds of the universe's creation in the
theorized Big Bang. One might even be sent to hover over and obtain
direct images of the consuming gravitational forces at regions
known as black holes.
</P>
<P>
   The audience of senior astronomers as well as graduate students
just starting their careers broke into laughter when Goldin,
driving home his anticomplacency message, said, ``Too many of you
are hugging the Hubble Space Telescope.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the knowing laughter that comes from hearing a truth
exposed. Because of years of budget constraints, astronomers said
later, those in the field had stopped dreaming and were clinging to
what they had, dwelling on ways to keep the Hubble operating longer
or developing a larger version, called the Next Generation Space
Telescope, for launching in the next decade. The Hubble, deployed
in 1991, was designed to have a 15-year lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's telling us it's OK to dream again,'' said Dr. Michael S.
Turner, University of Chicago astrophysicist.
</P>
<P>
   Some astronomers expressed skepticism. Where's the money? How
can we dream if we do not have something now to live on and work
with? Where are specific plans or new institutional frameworks for
transforming dreams into reality?
</P>
<P>
   Such reservations might have been more widespread if the call to
dream again had come from anyone other than Goldin. Since he became
NASA administrator in 1992, he has shaken and stirred the agency
more than any previous leader in the period after the Apollo
lunar-landing project of the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert Gehrz of the University of Minnesota, the president
of the astronomical society, said Goldin ``has been widely
praised'' for reviving and streamlining the planetary exploration
program and then establishing a new effort, called the Origins
Program, bringing together biologists, astronomers, and planetary
scientists to study the newly discovered extrasolar planetary
systems for evidence of life.
</P>
<P>
   To save a moribund planetary program, Goldin introduced a new
design philosophy of ``faster, cheaper, better'' missions,
replacing the past reliance on expensive, multi-purpose spacecraft.
These missions took years to get off the ground, and a single
failure often left scientists with nothing. Under the new program,
modest Mars expeditions are setting forth every two years in a
sustained program leading to a return of Mars rocks in the middle
of the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, at another astronomy meeting, as observers were
detecting the first planets around other stars, Goldin announced
his vision for the Origins program.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time, we didn't have a nickel in the budget for
Origins, just a vision that we might someday be able to search for
life on other planets,'' Goldin reminded a group of scientists in
another speech 10 days earlier. ``Now Origins is funded at $1
billion over five years. It happened because the scientific
community came to consensus, embraced a vision and pressed ahead
with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked why astronomers should take his new challenge seriously,
Goldin replied: ``I've delivered every time I've pushed the
boundary.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldin's speech came at an opportune time because, under the
auspices of the National Academy of Sciences, astronomers are
conducting a broad review of research goals and priorities for the
next decade. The study, to be completed by the end of the year, is
headed by Dr. Christopher McKee of the University of California at
Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   Goldin conceded that NASA would not be able to count on an
expanding budget to pay for new undertakings. Its annual budget is
$14 billion and not likely to be increased much in coming years.
Indeed, its budget is continually under pressure from cost-cutting
Congresses. Of that amount, $2.2 billion is spent on space
sciences, with most of the balance going to human flight programs
like the space shuttle and the International Space Station, now
being assembled in Earth orbit.
</P>
<P>
   But Goldin said in the interview that he hoped to increase space
science's budget share. He is also holding discussions with leaders
of the National Science Foundation and the Energy Department to
undertake more joint and coordinated research efforts, especially
those combining particle physics and astrophysics to explore primal
mysteries of cosmic origins and evolution.
</P>
<P>
   Just as he enforced a new design philosophy for planetary
missions, Goldin said the space agency should reverse its approach
to all astronomy programs. In most cases, he said, the practice has
been to plan a mission and then develop the necessary instruments
to carry it out.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, the NASA leader recommended that, instead, the
agency should support research on ``a continuing line of
cutting-edge technology'' in imaging systems, spectrographs for
examining light from space objects, lightweight telescope mirrors,
innovative robotics and new, less expensive propulsion systems.
Then missions should be launched as soon as the technology is
ready, and no later. ``We cannot suffer from the `ready-aim-aim'
syndrome, which we've seen too much of,'' Goldin told the
astronomers.
</P>
<P>
   With this approach of ``just-in-time'' technology, Goldin said,
the new emphasis will be on ``fast turnaround times of only a
couple of years and costs of just a few million dollars'' for new
missions involving new exploring techniques. By then, sometime well
into the next decade, he said it would be time to send the Hubble
and other old observatories ``into well-deserved retirement.''
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers ``hold tight to older technologies because we are
comfortable with them,'' he said, but they ``consume a great deal
of money for maintenance and updating, preventing us from
developing and launching new and improved systems.'' Then he
warned, ``We cannot continue on this path.''
</P>
<P>
   Listening to Goldin talk, Turner of Chicago whispered to the
person in the next seat, ``He's a street-smart dreamer.''

A SUMMER OF SARGENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRISTINE TEMIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This may be the ``Sargent Summer'' in Boston, but there are
ambitious shows all over the state, from ``Stuart Davis in
Gloucester'' to ``Introjection: Tony Oursler Midcareer Survey,
1976-1999'' in Williamstown.
</P>
<P>
   And there's MASS MoCA. At last. Thirteen years in the making,
the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art in North Adams has
finally opened on a 13-acre campus of 19th-century factory
buildings, several newly renovated. MASS MoCA has evolved into a
huge center for visual and performing arts, an especially
sympathetic home for the too-big, the too-experimental, the
too-tough-to-categorize. A day there is a glorious dip into
end-of-century culture. This first summer, look for major
installations by the likes of Oursler, Joseph Beuys, Robert
Rauschenberg, and Mario Merz; a series of sound installations,
including one in an abandoned quarry; lectures by a list including
South Africa's distinguished anti-apartheid artist William
Kentridge; performances including a collaboration by choreographer
Trisha Brown and artist Terry Winters (June 26); and the new 3-D
digital opera ``Monsters of Grace,'' by Philip Glass and Robert
Wilson (July 17.) MASS MoCA is putting the state on the
contemporary art map as no Boston institution has managed to do.
</P>
<P>
   MoCA is the latest and largest addition to the already rich
northern Berkshire art scene. The Williams College Museum of Art,
where the MoCA idea was hatched all those years ago, has organized
an important retrospective of the work of Oursler, a video artist
who gives his explorations of human neuroses and psychoses a veneer
of humor.
</P>
<P>
   The Clark Art Institute, also in Williamstown, offers
``Jean-Francois Millet: Drawn Into the Light'' (June 20-Sept. 6),
the largest assemblage of Millet works seen in the United States in
a quarter-century. On the checklist are star paintings like the
1857 ``The Gleaners'' from Paris's Musee d'Orsay, which hasn't lent
it in decades. Bravo to the Clark for coaxing it away.
</P>
<P>
   It was the great early-20th-century American painter John Sloan
who persuaded Stuart Davis to start summering on Cape Ann in 1915.
The area, Davis later wrote, ``had the brilliant light of
Provincetown, but with the important additions of topographical
severity and the architectural beauties of the Gloucester
schooner.'' He was a regular there until 1934, painting pivotal
pictures that form the core of ``Stuart Davis in Gloucester,'' at
the Cape Ann Historical Museum.
</P>
<P>
   The Maine art trail
</P>
<P>
   The state of Maine has latched on to the art-tourism phenomenon
by group-hyping its seven major art museums, in communities from
Ogunquit to Orono, as the ``Maine Art Museum Trail.'' Among trail
members' notable shows are ``Love and the American Dream'' at the
Portland Museum of Art (June 24-Oct. 17) and ``Inventing Acadia:
Artists and Tourists at Mount Desert'' at the Farnsworth Art Museum
in Rockland. The trail's Web site is www.maineartmuseums.org.
</P>
<P>
   Another trail member, the Colby Museum of Art, follows another
art world trend: the new wing. Next month, Colby opens its
9,000-square-foot Lunder Wing, named for museum patrons Peter and
Paula Lunder and designed by Los Angeles architect Frederick
Fisher, also responsible for the award-winning redesign of the P.S.
1 Contemporary Art Center in Long Island City, N.Y. Colby, which
already has a wing dedicated to the paintings of Alex Katz, now has
space to show more of its historic and contemporary collections,
which run from John Singleton Copley to Sol LeWitt.
</P>
<P>
   Closer to home
</P>
<P>
   Back in Boston, the Institute of Contemporary Art devotes its
space to ``Kerry James Marshall: Mementos'' (Tuesday to Aug. 22). A
native of Birmingham, Ala., Marshall came of age with the civil
rights movement, which this exhibition of his painting, sculpture,
and video honors.
</P>
<P>
   The DeCordova Museum in Lincoln presents the 1999 edition of the
DeCordova Annual (June 12-Sept. 6), a much-anticipated series of
mini-shows featuring discrete bodies of work by contemporary New
England artists, a dozen this time. Visitors will want to get
outside to enjoy the DeCordova's sculpture park, too, and the
yearlong outdoor terrace installation of the bronze self-portraits
of Robert Arneson, opening June 19.
</P>
<P>
   Once considered peripheral to a contemporary art scene anchored
in Europe and the United States, countries in Asia, Africa, and
South America have come into their own in recent years. The Peabody
Essex Museum in Salem recognizes one such nation's current work in
``Timeless Visions: Contemporary Art of India,'' up through Oct.
31.
</P>
<P>
   Return to the Age of Aquarius with ``Linda McCartney's Sixties:
Portrait of an Era,'' black-and-white photos of icons including the
Who, the Stones, and, of course, the Beatles, at the Currier
Gallery of Art in Manchester, N.H. (Aug. 14-Oct. 4).
</P>
<P>
   The late collector Paul Mellon revived the reputation of George
Stubbs, previously categorized as a ``horse painter.'' To honor
Mellon's prescience and his generosity to many US museums, the Yale
Center for British Art in New Haven offers ``George Stubbs in the
Collection of Paul Mellon: A Memorial Exhibition,'' through Sept.
5.
</P>
<P>
   Evicted from three buildings in just a decade, Real Art Ways, a
notable alternative space in Hartford, has once again rebounded.
RAW unveils its newly renovated galleries at 56 Arbor St. on June
27. If you're in Hartford soon, check out the shows at its
venerable Wadsworth Atheneum: ``Caravaggio's `St. John' &AMP;
Masterpieces from the Capitoline Museum in Rome,'' up only through
June 20, so hurry; ``Norman Lewis: Black Paintings, 1946-1977,''
through June 27; and ``Alfred Stieglitz, Georgia O'Keeffe, &AMP;
American Modernism,'' through July 11.
</P>
<P>
   Even with all this other activity, Sargent rules the summer. In
addition to the presentation of the traveling ``John Singer
Sargent'' show at the MFA, there are related exhibitions at
Harvard's Fogg Art Museum and the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum.
The Gardner's ``Sargent: The Late Landscapes,'' up through Sept.
26, focuses on a little-examined aspect of the work of a painter
typecast as portraitist. The Fogg's ``Sargent in the Studio:
Drawings, Sketchbooks, and Oil Sketches'' (June 10-Sept. 5) reveals
the behind-the-scenes labor of an artist whose work looks
spontaneous.
</P>
<P>
   If Sargent strikes you as glib _ a reaction shared by many _
take in another, grittier Harvard show, ``Death by Hogarth,'' that
18th-century satirist's examination of the implications of the word
``execution,'' at the Fogg Art Museum through July 18.
</P>
<P>
   Should you want to dig into the construction project that is
disrupting Boston for the foreseeable future, pay a visit to the
Boston University Art Gallery's ``Boston Artists and the Big Dig.''
Up through June 27, it includes 12 artists' responses to what is,
in addition to everything else, a massive visual fact of life.

   Sure, it almost went under a few months ago, but Dance Umbrella
is flying again, with an International Aerial Dance Festival that
gathers 11 companies of performers who are airborne, courtesy of
bungee cords, harnesses, and trapezes. Among the highlights of the
June 17-20 shows at the Emerson Majestic Theatre in Boston will be
David Parsons's ``Caught,'' a deer-trapped-in-headlights solo in
which strobe lights capture a dancer whizzing through the air.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Summer Dance Festival, primarily a training program
in jazz, tap, and musical theater, also offers free informal
performances on City Hall Plaza at 6 p.m. on July 9, 16, and 23.
Noted jazz dancer Danny Buraczeski is among the choreographers
showing work in the series.
</P>
<P>
   To catch the rest of the summer dance scene, you'll have to
travel. Not far, though, in the case of the Summer Stages Dance
program at Concord Academy in Concord, Mass. The school's new
Graham Gund-designed fitness facility includes a 2,500-square-foot
studio/performance space, headquarters for the dance program run by
academy faculty members Amy Spencer and Richard Colton. Essentially
an intensive student workshop, the summer program also features a
``Meet the Artist'' series, open to the public, with the
distinguished dance critic and historian Marcia B. Siegel
moderating presentations by faculty artists: Heidi Latsky &AMP; Larry
Goldhuber on July 15; Randall Jaynes on July 22; and Arthur Aviles
on July 29.
</P>
<P>
   Dance companies are ever seeking new settings in which to
perform; resorts are always on the lookout for new attractions to
lure guests. Both needs are met when the Boston-based flamenco
troupe Ramon de los Reyes dances at the Seven Hills Country Inn and
Restaurant in the Berkshire town of Lenox on Aug. 2.
</P>
<P>
   It's been a lean season for ballet in Boston, but if you drive
west this summer, things improve. The Saratoga Performing Arts
Center in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., the summer home of the New York
City Ballet, presents another Balanchine-based troupe this year,
too: Edward Villella's Miami City Ballet, which dances at SPAC June
11 and 12. Miami's programs feature some of Villella's greatest
Balanchine roles, including ``Prodigal Son'' and ``Rubies.'' The
July 7-24 City Ballet season at SPAC, meanwhile, opens with five
performances of the controversial new ``Swan Lake,'' choreographed
by current company director Peter Martins.
</P>
<P>
   A contingent from New York City Ballet turns up in Manchester,
Vt., for a July 28 show at the Southern Vermont Art Center, a
lovely theater halfway up a mountain. On the program, which is
presented by Ballet Manchester, is Martins's ``Barber Violin
Concerto.'' Ballet Manchester also presents six principals from the
Hartford Ballet at SVAC on Aug. 11.
</P>
<P>
   The Bates Dance Festival at Bates College in Lewiston, Maine,
offers 12 public performances this year, including Doug Varone and
Dancers in a July 23 and 24 program featuring Varone's new ``Bel
Canto,'' a comic dance set to Bellini. Other Bates highlights
include Philadelphia-based hip-hop troupe Rennie Harris
PureMovement in ``Rome &AMP; Jewels'' on Aug. 6 and 7, and ``New Works:
Sean Curran &AMP; Victoria Marks'' on Aug. 12. Performances are in
Bates's Schaeffer Theatre.
</P>
<P>
   Bolshoi principal Nina Ananiashvili is one of the great dramatic
ballerinas of the late 20th century. Among the fellow Bolshoi
dancers she brings to the Berkshires for her Aug. 25-29 Jacob's
Pillow run is Alexei Ratmansky, a choreographer who will present
two US premieres. Highlights from the standard Russian repertory
are also on the Ananiashvili program.
</P>
<P>
   Another Pillow highlight is the return of the Mark Morris Dance
Group, Aug. 3-8, with Morris's ``Dancing Honeymoon,'' set to songs
of Gershwin, Kern, and Porter. The Morris gig is even more notable
than usual, since the company isn't scheduled for a Boston visit
next season.
</P>
<P>
   The Pillow presents the Trisha Brown Company July 7-11, in the
world premiere of Brown's first work set to jazz, a collaboration
with trumpeter Dave Douglas and painter Terry Winters. There's a
related first, the Brown/Winter lecture/performance at the
Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art (MASS MoCA) in North Adams
on June 26. An off-campus Pillow presentation, the event coincides
with a joint show of works on paper by Winters and Brown: Turns out
the choreographer is an impressive draftsman, too.
</P>
<P>
   How many times have you longed for a bed during a performance?
Berkshire-based choreographer Laurie McLeod is providing them. Each
audience member at her series of three open rehearsals in MASS
MoCA's theater _ Aug. 6, 10, and 12 _ gets a futon to lie on while
watching the dancers of her ``Victory Girl Productions'' clamber up
the walls and dangle from the rafters. After each run-through, the
audience will make suggestions and McLeod will incorporate them or
not, presenting the evolved version the next time around, for a
very relaxed audience.

   IN THE LAB: A Gonorrhea Vaccine Is Tested in Mice
</P>
<P>
   Researchers working with mice have developed a vaccine for
gonorrhea that is delivered through the nose and reduces vaginal
colonization of gonorrhea bacteria. The findings were reported last
week in Chicago at a conference of the American Society for
Microbiology.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 62 million people suffer from gonorrhea worldwide,
according to the World Health Organization. The American Social
Health Association, an organization that studies sexually
transmitted diseases, estimates that in the United States, 650,000
new cases are reported each year, though experts note that the rate
has been declining fairly steadily over the past decade. But the
disease is rising among young people and in minority groups.
</P>
<P>
   The research, involving 60 mice, was conducted at the Uniformed
Services University of the Health Sciences in Bethesda, Md. Dr. Ann
Jerse, a microbiologist at the university and her colleagues found
that when proteins from the bacteria that causes gonorrhea were
applied in the noses of the mice, cells in the nasal cavity
attached themselves to the foreign antigen and eventually migrated
to the vagina, where they were found to stimulate local immunity
throughout the mice. ``This is a real breakthrough,'' said Jerse.
``Gonorrhea is an expensive and painful disease.''
</P>
<P>
   It also is a leading cause of infertility among women worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Gonorrhea can be cured with antibiotics, but symptoms in women
often go unnoticed until it causes permanent scarring of the
reproductive organs.
</P>
<P>
   The success of the gonorrhea experiment in mice bodes well for
other nasal vaccinations in animal trials, including meningitis and
the influenza virus. ``We are cautiously optimistic,'' said Linda
Alexander, president and chief executive officer of American Social
Health Association, which is in Research Triangle Park, N.C.
``Vaccines offer the only true hope in protection against sexually
transmitted diseases.''
</P>
<P>
   THERAPIES: Vitamin E Disappoints as Skin Healer
</P>
<P>
   In a recent study, researchers were surprised to find that
vitamin E oil, generally recommended to help wounds heal more
smoothly, was not effective. ``We were shocked,'' said Dr. Leslie
S. Baumann, the director of cosmetic dermatology at the University
of Miami School of Medicine, who conducted the research. ``We
thought we had proven how great vitamin E was. Instead, it was
obvious that it was worse than the placebo.''
</P>
<P>
   In the small study, published recently in The Journal of
Dermatologic Surgery, Baumann enrolled 15 patients who had
undergone surgery to remove skin cancers. They were given the two
creams and instructed to use each on one half of the wound.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the patients dropped out of the study within 48 hours
because of skin irritation from what turned out to be the vitamin E
cream. Two others later developed similar rashes.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of one week, half the patients thought the area
treated with the placebo, a Vaseline-like ointment, was healing
better, though later 70 percent reported no difference. Physicians
called in after 12 weeks to examine the wounds thought there was no
difference in 60 percent of the wounds, and that the ointment side
was better in 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In a commentary in the journal, Dr. Arnold W. Klein of Los
Angeles noted that many cosmetics contained a form of vitamin E
that was less likely than the one used to cause rashes and
suggested further research with them, as well as with different
doses. Baumann said she had been trying to replicate the way her
patients had been dosing themselves _ by breaking open vitamin E
capsules and applying their contents to their wounds.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David H. McDaniel, an assistant professor of dermatology at
Eastern Virginia Medical School in Virginia Beach, said there had
been quite a ``tug of war'' about vitamin E among researchers. His
patients most often apply the contents of vitamin E capsules
directly to their wounds, a practice he said would seem to be of
``unpredictable benefit'' at best, he said. ``If somebody comes in
for a consultation, I'll tell them that I've seen it work in some
cases and cause rashes in other cases,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To help healing, Baumann recommends taking 500 milligrams of
vitamin C twice a day to aid collagen production; applying an
antibacterial ointment; and covering a wound with a polyurethane
dressing like Tegaderm.
</P>
<P>
   PATTERNS: A Closer Look at Those Who Stay Slim
</P>
<P>
   The National Weight Control Registry is keeping tabs on more
than 2,500 people who have lost weight, and researchers are looking
for more volunteers to join the study. Participants must have lost
at least 30 pounds and kept it off for at least one year.
</P>
<P>
   In the five years since the study began, the researchers have
come up with some general findings about people who lose weight and
keep it off.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've learned so far is that these people have not found
any secret to maintaining a weight loss,'' said Dr. James O. Hill
of the University of Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   But there seem to be three common factors, he added: They eat a
low-fat diet, watch their total calorie intake and have a ``very
high level of physical activity.'' Most walk each day and many do
so briskly for at least an hour. They also reported doing
bicycling, aerobics or resistance training.
</P>
<P>
   Hill and his colleague, Dr. Rena Wing of the University of
Pittsburgh and the Brown University School of Medicine, are trying
to identify the psychological, physiological and behavioral factors
that separate these people from the millions who try and fail.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like these people are so different from other
people,'' Wing said. Most had tried to lose weight before, but
failed. ``It seems to me that they had a whole different approach:
`This time I'm going to do it.'''
</P>
<P>
   The registry can be reached at (800) 606-6927 or at the e-mail
address Registry(AT)MSX.UPMC.edu.

WHAT POWERS AUSTIN POWERS? QUIET OBSERVATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB STRAUSS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Mike Myers's public image is not exactly that of a
bookworm. The former ``Saturday Night Live'' comic achieved fame
playing highly social characters such as Wayne Campbell, the genial
teenage host of the cable access rock party (and later hit-film
franchise) ``Wayne's World.'' Or the talkative Linda Richman, the
world's most effusive Barbra Streisand fan, based on Myers's own
mother-in-law. Even the bent, blase Dieter, MC of the German dance
show ``Sprockets,'' gets out there and mixes.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, Myers has enjoyed great success with his most outgoing
character yet: Austin Powers, a swinging British superspy
cryogenically frozen in the 1960s, thawed out, and ready to resume
his playboy lifestyle in the more conservative 1990s. The 1997
low-budget ``Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery'' was not
only a solid profit maker for New Line Cinema. The spoof of James
Bond films and early psychedelia struck a deep chord in kids and
pop-culture pundits alike, resulting in a kind of media afterlife
that's raised the bucktoothed, furry-chested sex symbol to an
almost Connery-like status of his own.
</P>
<P>
   But it is, paradoxically, the introverted Myers's penchant for
quiet observation and in-depth study that has made Austin and his
other comic creations such detail-rich screams.
</P>
<P>
   ``His father was an encyclopedia salesman, and I always joke
that that made Mike a comedy and pop-culture encyclopedia,'' says
Jay Roach, director of ``Man of Mystery'' and its sequel, which
opens Friday. ``He can absorb anything and store it, categorize it
and cross-reference it. He does that in the writing process and the
performance process. What he also stores is his own recombined,
reinterpreted versions of things. There's a spirit of organized
chaos that Mike makes possible.''
</P>
<P>
   In the sequel, the naughtily subtitled ``The Spy Who Shagged
Me'' (ask a British friend), our hero's longtime, uptight nemesis
Dr. Evil (also played by Myers) manages to steal Austin's
magnificent mojo. The villain takes the all-important life force
back through a time machine to Carnaby Street-era London. Austin
pursues and is assisted in his quest by miniskirted mod squadette
Felicity Shagwell (Heather Graham of ``Boogie Nights''), a CIA
agent as uninhibited as he is _ or was before the mojo went
missing.
</P>
<P>
   In typical fashion, Myers, 36, is more interested in discussing
the serious emotional themes of the Austin Powers movies than their
silly shenanigans and infantile-to-sophomoric gag range.
</P>
<P>
   ``The central question of the first movie was: Will Austin find
love despite his outmoded sexual mores?'' Myers, short and stocky
and a model of soft-spoken Canadian politeness, says with utter
sincerity. ``The central question of `The Spy Who Shagged Me' is:
Will Austin find love despite his lack of belief in love due to a
broken heart and a rekindling of his old swinger ways? We don't
have a whole lot in common, but Austin and I are believers in true
love, to that extent.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarities end there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike's the least flirtatious guy I've ever worked with,'' says
Heather Graham. ``He's so incredibly devoted to his wife. It's very
romantic. And it's just funny that the man who makes the movies
about the swinging guy is really like that.''
</P>
<P>
   `Not a big hugger'
</P>
<P>
   Myers says he's more than just conjugally committed. ``I have a
very healthy and well-maintained proximic bubble. Much to the
amusement/frustration of my New York Jewish wife and her family,
I'm not a big hugger. I'm a very shy person, ultimately. And it's
not only being Canadian, but from growing up in a British-Canadian
house. You don't cry a lot, you tend to shake hands and not hug.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, Myers and his wife of seven years, writer Robin
Ruzan, are almost always in close, well, proximity. She's often at
his side during interviews and hockey games, sure signs of true
love if there ever were any.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what shocked us both was how different our upbringings
were, but how we nevertheless came to the same conclusions about
how we wanted to live,'' he says of the match. ``We literally do
say `How did we find each other? What are the odds?' I mean, I'm so
Protestant, so English, and so Canadian. She's Jewish, such a New
Yorker, and so American. I don't even know if it's that opposites
attracted each other. It's more just shock that two different
laboratories came up with the same equation.''
</P>
<P>
   Family has always been a source of strength and inspiration for
Myers. He speaks with wistful affection of his father, who died in
1991 after a harrowing battle with Alzheimer's disease. The elder
Myers moved his family from Liverpool to the Toronto suburb of
Scarborough before Mike was born, and brought his love of absurdist
British comedy along with him. When not, yes, giving his three sons
(Mike's the youngest) encyclopedias to read, he would immerse them
in reruns of ``The Goon Show,'' ``Beyond the Fringe,'' and ``Monty
Python's Flying Circus.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike's mother, meanwhile, had once been an actress, and she
detected talent in her son at an early age. Mike appeared in a
number of Canadian commercials as a kid, and on graduating from
high school he had to choose between college and a gig with
Toronto's Second City improvisational comedy group. He chose to go
with the organization that trained Gilda Radner, Dan Aykroyd,
Martin Short, and many others who'd made their mark in TV sketch
comedy, and like most of them ended up getting his big break on
``SNL.''
</P>
<P>
   Canada the salad bowl
</P>
<P>
   Myers sees a link between Canada and comedy _ and no, not a glib
one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're an observer nation,'' he says. ``We're not
America, we're not England, we're also not the country your parents
came from. It's an odd thing; we're not a melting pot, we're a
salad bowl. So we tend to observe how people talk, how they do
things. We even have a ministry of multiculturalism. And because of
that, we have this wonderful appetizer tray of the world and the
world's behavior. I think that's what it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Myers's approach hasn't always worked. Following the
$100 million-plus success of his debut feature ``Wayne's World,''
``So I Married an Axe Murderer'' crashed both critically and
financially and was followed by several years of professional
inactivity. Even though his own dramatic portrayal of disco
impresario Steve Rubell earned high praise, the
not-intended-to-be-a-comedy ``54'' was laughed off screens last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Austin Powers has put Myers back on top, but it has also brought
with it heightened expectations of popularity that may not be
realistically attainable. Like a true academic, though, he keeps
the ups and downs of stardom in detached perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been an amazingly positive experience, I've enjoyed every
aspect of it,'' he says. ``But if you make stuff, and I made stuff
on `Saturday Night Live' for six years, one of the deaths of
creativity is being results-oriented, having any sort of
expectation or attachment. What you have to do is just focus on
what you're working on at the time. I love doing that, and that's
kind of where my emphasis lies. Having said that, that Austin
Powers has met an audience, that anyone should like it, is kind of
a miracle and kind of amazing _ I always thought of it as just this
great cosmic in joke that was specific to my house. It's nice; just
for total accuracy, I don't shun it.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I never make any plans. You can't. It has to do with one
day finding out my father has Alzheimer's and one day he's dead. I
think what happens is you stop and realize it's bigger than you.
You have to drop all plans for world domination at that point. It
really is Operation Meteor (that) can hit the planet at any time.''

ROCKIN' REUNIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Reunions, high ticket prices, teen idols, a new concert tent,
and Woodstock's 30th anniversary help shape this soon-to-be frantic
summer pop season. Many of the same faces are surfacing again _
from Jimmy Buffett to Steve Miller to Tony Bennett _ but the
excitement lies in the return of Bruce Springsteen and the E Street
Band, as well as in one-time-only double bills of Bob Dylan/Paul
Simon, Alanis Morissette/Tori Amos, and Ani DiFranco/Maceo Parker.
</P>
<P>
   For the more stout of heart, rap-metal band Limp Bizkit blares
onto the road. And, let's face it, any summer in which Cher is
touring has got to provide some much-needed comic relief.
</P>
<P>
   The Springsteen tour will dwarf all others. He comes to the
FleetCenter Aug. 19 and 21, though late last week the rumor was
that he would add as many as three more dates before tickets
actually go on sale. Springsteen has played somber acoustic music
the past few years, but his return to rock arenas with his New
Jersey brothers should again earn him lion-heart status.
</P>
<P>
   Springsteen brings a consummate showmanship, as does the other
big reunion group _ Boston's J. Geils Band, which plays in its home
town June 23-24. Between Springsteen and Geils's Peter Wolf,
they'll bop around stage more often than a dozen shoe-gazing bands
combined. (The other expected reunion, of Crosby, Stills, Nash, and
Young, has been postponed till the fall.)
</P>
<P>
   Springsteen is charging a top ticket of $67.50 _ hardly cheap,
but a bargain next to Cher's $75 at her Tweeter Center show July
17, Dylan/Simon's $115 at their Tweeter date July 22, and the
almost unfathomable $151 to see Whitney Houston at the Wang Center
July 7-8. Was it that long ago that Houston played reasonably
priced concerts on Boston Common?
</P>
<P>
   No stadiums, but . . .
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, there are no stadium shows this summer. We had two
Foxboro Stadium headliners last month _ the Dave Matthews Band and
George Strait _ but that's it for the season.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the summer is jampacked at the 19,900-capacity Tweeter
Center in Mansfield and the new, 5,000-seat BankBoston Pavilion on
Northern Avenue's Pier 8 in Boston. The latter venue, which opens
July 10 with the Temptations and Ashford &AMP; Simpson, will have
harbor views, though there are worries about noise from Logan
Airport traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Noise concerns haven't deterred a crowd of artists from signing
on for performances at the site, however. Among the more appealing
acts: soul diva Aretha Franklin on July 12, disco survivor Donna
Summer on July 14, dance-rockers Jamiroquai on July 18, the
swinging Brian Setzer Orchestra July 20, country star Faith Hill
July 27, jazz dean Tony Bennett Aug. 20, and the Latin-spiced Gipsy
Kings Sept. 10-11.
</P>
<P>
   The new pavilion also has booked more classic rock acts, a sign
that some former arena rockers have shrunk into the tent market.
These include Chicago and the Doobie Brothers July 11; Jethro Tull
Aug. 26; and the Moody Blues Aug. 31. (The last is not announced
officially yet.)
</P>
<P>
   Despite these moves, classic rock is still a major force at the
larger Tweeter Center. The Don Law Co., which books the venue for
SFX Entertainment, reports fast-moving sales for the
Journey/Foreigner bill June 20, and the hair-band odyssey of
Poison, Ratt, Great White, and LA Guns July 15. Sales have also
been brisk for ex-Pink Floyd singer/ guitarist Roger Waters Aug. 4,
and the Steve Miller/George Thorogood &AMP; the Destroyers bill July
31. The Allman Brothers Band is there twice this summer _ June 26
and Aug. 20 _ though that's one fewer than its three appearances
last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Boomers will again be served, but so will teenagers. The growing
teen market has already caused 'N Sync's shows of July 24-25 at the
Tweeter Center to sell out. Look for the same for Britney Spears at
BankBoston Pavilion Sept. 1. Other teen-slanted bills are Brandy
and Tyrese at Tweeter June 25 and a Nickelodeon-sponsored night
with Monica, Tatyana Ali, and 98 Degrees at Tweeter June 29.
Meanwhile, far older teen idols (Mickey Dolenz, Peter Noone, and
Bobby Sherman) play the North Shore Music Theatre in Beverly July
24.
</P>
<P>
   As for festivals, there's the first-time Guinness Fleadh at
Suffolk Downs June 19 with Elvis Costello, Hootie and the Blowfish,
and many others (unfortunately, not Van Morrison, who would have
put it over the top).
</P>
<P>
   But there's no Lollapalooza, H.O.R.D.E., or Smoking Grooves,
since these fests have fallen victim to the enormous number of
radio-sponsored shows nationwide. The recent WBCN alternative-rock
River Rave _ with the Red Hot Chili Peppers headlining _ was really
a de facto Lollapalooza. That leaves the Ozzfest and Lilith Fair as
two of the bigger festivals left. The Ozzfest is at Tweeter June 16
and 18. The Lilith Fair arrives at the Mansfield venue Aug. 3, but
it will be the last year for the fair, says founder Sarah
McLachlan. She headlines a potent Lilith lineup that includes the
Pretenders, Sheryl Crow, and Aimee Mann.
</P>
<P>
   A choice of smaller fests
</P>
<P>
   Smaller festivals have gained momentum, notably the neo-hippie
Berkshire Mountains Music Festival in Great Barrington Aug. 13-15
(run by Boston's Gamelan Productions and featuring Los Lobos,
Strangefolk, the Slip, and Jiggle the Handle); the Vans Warped Tour
in Northampton July 17 with Cypress Hill, Ice T, and Blink 182; and
the Cape Cod Summer Music Festival at Falmouth's Barnstable County
Fairgrounds July 31 with Maceo Parker, Morphine, and Violent
Femmes.
</P>
<P>
   Outside of New England, Woodstock, the granddaddy of rock
festivals, will make the summer's biggest splash July 23-25 at the
decommissioned Griffiss Air Force Base in Rome, N.Y. Everyone from
Aerosmith and the Dave Matthews Band to Korn, Limp Bizkit, DMX,
Wyclef Jean, Rage Against the Machine, Metallica, and even Willie
Nelson is performing.
</P>
<P>
   This year's Woodstock will attempt to be cutting-edge, defying
the general summer trend toward predictability. Among the more
far-out shows closer to Boston: the Electronica tour with Orbital,
Crystal Method, and Lo-Fi All Stars at Worcester Palladium July 10;
and the in-your-face Limp Bizkit/Kid Rock/Staind bill at Lowell's
Tsongas Arena July 23.
</P>
<P>
   There's a lot to interest folk-rockers this summer, starting
with Ani DiFranco at the FleetCenter June 17 and the Dylan/Simon
bill at the Tweeter Center July 22-23.
</P>
<P>
   Country fans also have much to crow about. Video goddess Shania
Twain is at the FleetCenter June 14. Country-rock/folkie Mary
Chapin Carpenter is at BankBoston Pavilion July 23, followed by
Lyle Lovett July 31 and Dwight Yoakam (with Deanna Carter) Aug. 15.
Holliston native/Nashville star Jo Dee Messina is at Indian Ranch
in Webster that same day, and the Mavericks at Hampton Beach (N.H.)
Casino Ballroom that same night.
</P>
<P>
   The never-shy Wynonna belts it out at the South Shore Music
Circus July 14 and North Shore Music Theatre July 19. The Music
Circus also has Lorrie Morgan June 18, Martina McBride July 17, and
Vince Gill Aug. 14. Alabama headlines the WKLB Country Festival
with Ty Herndon and the Kinleys at Tweeter Aug. 28. Traditionalist
Junior Brown is at the Middle East July 22 and the Beachcomber in
Wellfleet July 23.
</P>
<P>
   If you're a blues fan, you'll have a busy summer. B. B. King is
at BankBoston Pavilion Sept. 14. Buddy Guy, Jimmie Vaughan, and
Shemekia Copeland are at the Music Circus June 19 in a sweet bill.
Susan Tedeschi is at the Music Circus Sept. 3. The City of
Presidents Blues Festival is at Quincy's Veterans Memorial Stadium
June 27 with James Cotton, Shirley Lewis, Bruce Katz, Love Dogs,
and more. Former Rolling Stone Mick Taylor is at the House of Blues
July 8-9. The Winter Island Blues Festival in Salem is July 10
(with Booker T &AMP; the MGs and Derek Trucks) and July 11 with
Shemekia Copeland and Entrain. The annual Battle of the Blues Bands
is at Harpers Ferry July 2-4.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, one of the most-asked questions: Where are the
Backstreet Boys? Look for them in the fall, not summer. Where is
Ricky Martin? Same thing. Hey, not everyone tours in the summer. It
just seems that way.

CAVALLI OPERA TOPS FESTIVAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   An international audience has gathered for the Boston Early
Music Festival June 7-13, and the centerpiece of more than 100
official and concurrent events will be a major new production of
``Ercole Amante,'' a spectacular opera the Italian composer
Francesco Cavalli wrote for the court of Louis XIV. The cast
includes Nathaniel Watson, Lisa Saffer, and William Hite, and the
work is under the artistic direction of Paul O'Dette and Stephen
Stubbs. Following the Boston run, the cast moves out to Tanglewood
for another pair of performances, before moving on to the Utrecht
Festival in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   Constantin Lifschitz is not the most publicized of the young
Russian pianists, but he is the most significant. His superior
technical skills can be taken for granted; what is so compelling is
how personal, risky, intense, and emotionally exposed his playing
is. His program at the Taubman Institute and International Piano
Festival and at Monadnock Music features music by Bach (the Italian
Concerto and French Ouverture), Beethoven (six bagatelles), Chopin
(two scherzi), and Shostakovich (Sonata 2).
</P>
<P>
   Tanglewood's Festival of Contemporary Music this year is under
the artistic direction of Asian-American composer Tan Dun and
features several works by another of the composers in residence,
Britain's George Benjamin. The festival is an interesting place to
find out what is on the minds of young composers _ what they are
thinking about and listening to will frequently turn out to be what
the rest of us will be thinking about and listening to in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   Tanglewood has announced what looks like a very strong season.
Among the highlights should be a suite from Andre Previn's opera
``A Streetcar Named Desire'' (July 10), Seiji Ozawa conducting a
Duke Ellington program with Wynton Marsalis (July 24), a joint
concert by the Tanglewood Music Center Orchestra and the Gustav
Mahler Youth Orchestra under Ozawa Aug. 1, and the Gustav Mahler
Orchestra in a performance of Mahler's Seventh Symphony under the
direction of Claudio Abbado Aug. 7.
</P>
<P>
   Lifschitz's recital comes in a context of 10 others in a crowded
two weeks of activity at the Taubman Institute. Among the
distinguished recitalists will be Beth Levin (July 16), Kemal Gekic
(July 17), and Piotr Anderszewski, the last the most remarkable
pianist to have emerged from Poland since Krystian Zimerman (July
20). Lifschitz shares the Monadnock Music schedule with the New
Zealand and Ciompi String Quartets; pianists Christopher Taylor,
Sergey Schepkin, Virginia Eskin, and Russell Sherman; and the piano
trio Triple Helix. Monadnock's opera this summer is Rossini's ``La
Cenerentola'' (Aug. 28) with D'Anna Fortunato returning to the
title role she sang there 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Another traditional haunt of lovers of piano music, chamber
music, unusual repertory, and important if unheralded artists is
the Newport Festival, July 9-25. This summer's debut artists
include pianists from Cuba (Juana Zayas), Ireland (John O'Conor),
Russia (Vladimir Ovchinnikov), Azerbaijan (Farhad Badalbeily), and
Argentina (Nelson Goerner). Victor Borge returns July 16 for an
 &UR; evening &LR;  of comedy in music, and the eminent British pianist Dame
Moura Lympany emerges from retirement for high tea and a
``conversation'' July 24. The season closes July 25 with an
appearance by that great Newport favorite Dubravka Tomsic.
</P>
<P>
   Not so very long ago, if you wanted to hear music in the summer
you had to travel out of town. The gap has now been filled. July in
Jordan presents a full schedule in air-conditioned Jordan Hall.
Among the participants are Russell Sherman, Wha-Kyung Byun, and a
number of their most celebrated students in a program of piano
ensemble music (July 6), the Apollo Ensemble (July 7), Aston Magna
(July 14), the Borromeo String Qaurtet and friends (July 20), and
the Handel &AMP; Haydn Society (July 22). Popular attractions include
violinist Mark O'Connor (July 8) and Arlo Guthrie (July 22).
</P>
<P>
   Early music continues beyond the confines of the Early Music
Festival in the Boston University Series coordinated by Mark Kroll
(Wednesdays June 9-30) and in the International Baroque Institute
at the Longy School of Music (July 20-24). The Society for
Historically Performed Performance tours a New England circuit that
brings it to Lindsey Chapel in Emmanuel Church Thursdays from June
24 to July 22.
</P>
<P>
   The goals of the early-music movement are continued in the
activities of American Classics, which works to recover American
popular music from earlier periods. There will be three concerts in
the Longy School beginning June 15 with a cowboy music program
called ``How the West Was Sung.'' The Lydian Quartet's annual
summer festival at Brandeis University runs Sunday nights through
June. Lee Hyla and David Rakowski are the composers in residence at
the Composers Conference and Chamber Music Center at Wellesley
College July 28-Aug. 7.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout New England there seems to be a chamber-music
festival wherever at least three musicians can find three folding
chairs. The Rockport Festival, under the direction of David Deveau,
offers strong programs throughout June. The Cape &AMP; Islands Chamber
Music Festival flourishes in various locations Aug. 3-20. The
granddaddy of them all is Marlboro Music on weekends from July 17
through Aug. 15 in Persons Auditorium at Marlboro College in
southern Vermont; programs at Marlboro are never announced in
advance.
</P>
<P>
   Opera is not quite the missing art it used to be in New England
summers. The big event of the season will be the premiere of
Stephen Paulus's ``Summer,'' based on the novel by Edith Wharton,
in the Koussevitsky Arts Center at Berkshire Community College
beginn

   The man of the summer who has 'em all ravin', to paraphrase Cole
Porter, is the bard from Stratford-on-Av'n. There's nothing new
about Shakespeare in the summer, but the success of ``Shakespeare
in Love'' has theater companies hunting for every word good Will
has written. Leading the charge is the Oscar-winning star of that
film, Gwyneth Paltrow, returning to the Williamstown, Mass., stage
for ``As You Like It,'' the run of which is already sold out.
</P>
<P>
   If your taste runs less to Shakespeare than to commercial
theater, particularly musicals, there's good news for you, too,
since the downtown scene is more lively than usual, fueled by
``Titanic'' and the return of ``Rent.'' ``Titanic,'' now renamed
``Titanic: A New Musical,'' begins its two-week run at the Wang
Theatre Wednesday and opens for review Friday. The show, unlike the
movie, was not immediately embraced when it opened, in 1997, but as
the kinks with the complicated stagecraft were ironed out, both
audiences and critics started to warm to it, and when it deservedly
won that year's Tony for best musical, along with four other Tonys
(one for the Maury Yeston score), its success was guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rent'' _ June 15-28 at the Shubert Theatre _ has gone in the
opposite direction, opening to spectacular reviews and immediately
becoming the hot ticket and Tony winner of the 1996 season.
Reactions started to cool when it began to tour the following year,
so it will be interesting to see how it plays now that both the
hype and anti-hype have cooled.
</P>
<P>
   Another summer entry downtown is ``Fame _ The Musical,'' which
runs from July 6 to 18 at the Colonial Theatre, and is based on the
1980 movie about New York's High School of the Performing Arts. The
musical keeps the title song, but has a new score by Jacques Levy
and Steve Margoshes. It's followed at the Colonial by the revival
of ``Evita,'' July 21-Aug. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The unofficial New England Shakespeare festival begins with the
touring members of the Royal Shakespeare Company in New Haven
performing ``Troilus and Cressida'' beginning June 25 at the Long
Wharf Theatre, where it will play in repertory with Brian Friel's
adaptation of Turgenev's ``A Month in the Country,'' which begins
July 23. The visit is part of this year's International Festival of
Arts &AMP; Ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Boston, ``Measure for Measure'' is this year's Publick
offering of Shakespeare on the Charles. It follows ``Yeomen of the
Guard,'' which is there now, but the local theater community might
be a bit more intrigued by the third production, ``Nine,'' Aug.
5-Sept. 5, in which Lyric and Publick Theatre artistic director
Spiro Veloudos plays the Federico Fellini/Marcello Mastroianni
character from ``8 1/2,'' the film from which Yeston and Arthur
Kopit adapted the musical.
</P>
<P>
   `Caesar' on the Common
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The Commonwealth Shakespeare Company gets serious with its
Shakespeare this year, ``Julius Caesar,'' running from July 30 to
Aug. 14 at the Parkman Bandstand on Boston Common. Company head
Steven Maler will again be directing. In addition to the usual high
quality of the production values, you can't beat the ticket price _
it's free.
</P>
<P>
   Unless you have tickets, you won't be seeing Paltrow in ``As You
Like It'' at Williamstown (Aug. 4-15), but tickets remain for Bebe
Neuwirth (opposite her old ``Cheers'' cohort Roger Rees) in ``The
Taming of the Shrew'' (July 7-18). Another fellow who brushed up
his Shakespeare, Tom Stoppard, will be represented by ``Rosencrantz
and Guildenstern Are Dead'' on the smaller Nikos Stage. Other
highlights are Tennessee Williams's ``Camino Real'' (June 23-July
4) with Ethan Hawke and Blair Brown; ``A Raisin in the Sun'' (July
21-Aug. 1) with James McDaniel; and Arthur Miller's ``The Price''
(Aug. 18-29), all on the Main Stage. Three new plays follow ``R&AMP;G''
on the Nikos Stage: Warren Leight's ``Glimmer Brothers'' with David
Schwimmer (July 14-25); John Guare's ``Chaucer in Rome'' (July
28-Aug. 8); and Kenneth Lonergan's ``The Waverly Gallery'' (Aug.
11-22). WTF also goes to the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary
Art, in North Adams, for a musical set inside the atom, ``Quark
Victory,'' July 22-31.
</P>
<P>
   The best Shakespeare you can find year in, year out is at the
Lenox-based Shakespeare &AMP; Company. This season's outdoor mainstage
production is ``Love's Labour's Lost'' (July 23-Aug. 9), performed
at Edith Wharton's estate, the Mount. The company's artistic
director, Tina Packer, won't be leading that production, though.
She's moving indoors to the new 500-seat Duffin Theatre on East
Street at Lenox Memorial Middle and High School, where she'll be
directing Jonathan Epstein in ``Richard III,'' July 8-Aug. 1. Back
at the Mount, the Wharton adaptations are ``Glimpses of the Moon''
(June 18-Sept. 4) and ``Summer'' (Aug. 10-Oct. 17). The season
opens with Tod Randolph as Virginia Woolf in ``A Room of One's
Own,'' May 28-Aug. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in Western Massachusetts, the Berkshire Theatre
Festival in Stockbridge has a nice mix of quality writers and
directors. Christopher Renshaw (``The King and I'') opens the
season with the Sherlock Holmes mystery ``The Crucifer of Blood''
(June 24-July 10). Eric Hill follows with Orson Welles's ``Moby
Dick _ Rehearsed'' (July 13-31); Karen Allen stars in Joan
Ackermann's ``The Batting Cage'' (Aug. 3-14); and the mainstage
season concludes with David Ives's new comedy, ``Lives of the
Saints'' (Aug. 17-Sept. 4). The smaller BTF Unicorn has been one of
the more daring Berkshire venues under Hill's direction and offers
one of the more intriguing Shakespeare pieces of the season,
``Love's Fire'' (June 16-July 17), with seven top writers,
including Tony Kushner and Eric Bogosian, transforming his sonnets
into short plays. Richard Corley, who directed the sensational
``Quills'' two years ago, is back with his adaptation of ``Shoot
the Piano Player'' (July 22-Aug. 7); and Hill closes the season
directing ``Starr's Last Tape'' (Aug. 24-28).
</P>
<P>
   Playing in the Berkshires
</P>
<P>
   The newest kid on the Berkshire block is Barrington Stage Co. in
Sheffield, which opens with a revival of Jerry Herman's ``Mack and
Mabel'' (June 22-July 18) and follows with George C. Wolfe's
adaptation of Zora Neale Hurston's ``Spunk'' (July 21-Aug. 8),
closing with ``Tea'' (Aug. 5-22), Velina Hasu Houston's story about
the daughter of a Japanese war bride and an Indian-African-American
serviceman. In a new venue, Theatre Under the Stars, the company
presents the regional premiere of ``St. Nicholas,'' Conor ``The
Weir'' McPherson's one-man play about that lowliest of creatures,
the theater critic.
</P>
<P>
   Barrington Stage isn't the only theater to dare a season sans
Shakespeare. The American Repertory Theatre has a post-season
season with David Mamet's ``Boston Marriage,'' through June 27 at
the Hasty Pudding Theatre, and Eric Bogosian's ``Wake Up and Smell
the Coffee,'' June 22-27 at the Loeb Drama Center in Cambridge.
Davis Robinson directs the premiere of Beau Jest's latest
collaboration, ``The Last Resort,'' June 9-26 in the company's
South End theater, and Wellesley Summer Theatre has Brian Friel's
``Dancing at Lughnasa'' through June 26.
</P>
<P>
   North of Boston, Israel Horovitz's Gloucester Stage Company in
Gloucester is doing a season of his plays for its 20th-anniversary
season _ ``Park Your Car in Harvard Yard'' (July 7-18), ``Fighting
Over Beverly'' (July 28-Aug. 15), the premiere of ``Fast Hands''
(Aug. 18-Sept. 5), and ``Strong Man's Weak Child'' (Sept. 8-26).
</P>
<P>
   At the North Shore Music Theatre in Beverly, ``My Fair Lady''
continues through June 20, followed by the company's coproduction
with the Huntington of ``The Mikado'' June 29-July 18. Other
highlights include ``Kiss of the Spider Woman'' (Sept. 7-26) and
``The Secret Garden'' (Oct. 5-24).
</P>
<P>
   Going south, the Wellfleet Harbor Actors Theatre presents a
production of Steven Dietz's Pirandellian play within a play within
a play, ``Private Eyes'' (through June 20; a different production
returns to Shakespeare &AMP; Company, Aug. 5-Sept. 5); John Patrick
Shanley's ``Psychopathia Sexualis'' (June 30-July 24); David Ives's
``Mere Mortals'' (July 30-Sept. 5); and Sam Shepard's ``Eyes for
Consuela'' (Sept. 16-Oct. 10). The Provincetown Repertory Theatre
begins with Horton Foote's ``The Trip to Bountiful'' (June 15-July
3) and continues with Tennessee Williams's ``The Glass Menagerie''
(July 13-Aug. 8) and ``Goreyphobia'' (Aug. 17-Sept. 11). ``On the
Twentieth Century'' continues at the Goodspeed Opera House in East
Haddam, Conn., through July 3.

   ``Gods and Monsters'' _ One of last year's best films features
Ian McKellen's portrayal of horror-film director James Whale,
complete with his wandering eye for young boys. Brendan Fraser, in
a role that's about as far from ``George of the Jungle'' as you can
get, is remarkable as Whale's object of affection.
</P>
<P>
   ``My Sweet Suicide'' _ A dark comedy about a guy so inept he
must engage a woman to help him commit suicide. The story is bleak
but funny, in a nasty sort of way. Not for everyone, but fans of
writers such as Dennis Potter may find it intriguing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Psycho'' _ Was there ever a less promising rehash than this
one? Why take a work of absolute genius, one that was unmistakably
original, and remake it into something that only a marketer could
love? Director Gus Van Sant, whose career peaked with the bleak
``Drugstore Cowboy,'' shouldn't make films-by-numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the Earth to the Moon'' _ Tom Hanks's HBO miniseries on
American lunar exploration was one of television's great events
last year. Hanks's production humanizes the astronauts, and while
it's not as good as Philip Kaufman's ``The Right Stuff,'' it's well
worth renting.

   Turbocharged Lizards

<P>
   An easy way to improve the performance of a race car is by
adding a turbocharger, a compressor that pumps extra air into the
engine, allowing the fuel to burn more efficiently.

   Scientists have discovered that a monitor lizard is similarly
souped up. It comes equipped with a turbocharger of its own, a
``throat pump'' that provides extra air for the lungs.

   When lizards walk and run, they amble from side to side, flexing
their bodies laterally. The muscles that are responsible for this
flexing work in a different direction to expand the chest for
breathing. So, according to one hypothesis, at higher speeds
flexing predominates and breathing suffers, meaning that most
lizards cannot get enough air.
</P>
<P>
   Studies of monitor lizards have tended to contradict this
hypothesis, however, because they have not shown any constraint on
oxygen consumption. The new work, by scientists from Harvard, the
University of Massachusetts and the University of California at
Irvine, demonstrates that the difference is the monitor lizard's
throat pump.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, who reported on their work in the journal
Science, used videoradiography _ moving X-rays, in essence _ to
view what went on inside a lizard as it trundled along on a
treadmill.
</P>
<P>
   As the lizard breathes, air is drawn both into the lungs and
into an expanding cavity in the throat area. The cavity contracts,
pumping the air into the lungs. When the researchers disabled the
throat pump by propping the mouth open, monitor lizards showed the
same impairment of lung activity as other lizards.
</P>
<P>
   The Making of a Disaster
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane Mitch, which struck Central America in October, was
the deadliest storm in the Western Hemisphere this century. About
11,000 people were killed, mostly in Honduras and Nicaragua, in the
flooding and mudslides that accompanied days of torrential rain.
</P>
<P>
   But while it was torrential, that rain was not exceptional,
according to a new study by British and American researchers.
Rainfall amounts in the storm, they say in a letter to the journal
Nature, were comparable to other severe storms in the Atlantic
region.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists had a bit of good luck: one rain gauge survived
the deluge (they are often destroyed in hurricanes), and recorded
35 inches of rain over four days ended Oct. 31.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers suggested that other factors were largely
responsible for the widespread damage and loss of life. Among
these, they say, were the timing of the storm (it came at the end
of the rainy season, when the ground was already saturated and
could not soak up any more rain), the deforestation of hillsides
for use in agriculture, and forecasts that had predicted the storm
would move to the north and stay at sea, when it turned south and
inland.
</P>
<P>
   Wind-Borne Pollution
</P>
<P>
   National parks and wilderness areas are innocent bystanders amid
the violence that is air pollution, soiled by contaminants carried
on the wind from urban areas. Things have gotten so bad that in
April, the Clinton administration asked states to develop
long-range plans for cleaning up the outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   Further evidence of the extent of the problem comes from a study
of the air at Mount Rainier National Park in Washington, which
shows that it has higher concentrations of ozone than nearby urban
areas. Elevated ozone levels can harm vegetation and animals,
including humans.
</P>
<P>
   The study, by a scientist with the U.S. Geological Survey,
showed that the park, which is only 60 miles from Seattle, has the
highest average weekly levels of ozone of any location in the
state.
</P>
<P>
   Most of this is from ozone-creating compounds produced by the
burning of fossil fuels in cars and industry in the Seattle area.
But the problem is exacerbated because of Mount Rainier's
elevation. Ozone concentrations tend to increase at higher
altitudes as some ozone from the stratosphere disperses downward.
</P>
<P>
   A Failed Planet
</P>
<P>
   Astronomy has been awash in recent discoveries of planets
orbiting other stars. Now, researchers from the University of
Arizona say they may have found the remnants of a failed planet
circling a double star system 150 light-years from Earth.
</P>
<P>
   The astronomers analyzed infrared emissions from material around
the star system and determined that it was coming from dust similar
to that in the bands of dustin the asteroid belt between Mars and
Jupiter. That belt resulted from a would-be planet that could not
form because of Jupiter's huge gravitational forces. The scientists
concluded that similar forces must be at work in the double star
system to account for the debris.  &QL;

IT'S NOT WISE TO SAVE FOR COLLEGE IN CHILD'S NAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. When was the last time you filled out a college financial aid
form? You continue to advise readers to use their own name on
college savings, because the student's name will hinder the
applicant's eligibility. As a parent of five, I have filled out
said forms, and there is a section for listing the parents' assets.
Why? Because the parental assets are computed to determine the
family contribution. That means the more the parents have, the more
they are expected to contribute, and therefore the less financial
aid given. Short of going to court and disowning your child, your
assets will be calculated into the allotment of aid. Please check
your sources for educational financial aid.
</P>
<P>
   M.S., Bethlehem, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The last time I filled out financial aid forms was about a
year ago, and if I had a choice of doing it again or a root
canal... well, I'd have to think about it.
</P>
<P>
   You're correct that both the parents' and students' assets must
be listed on financial aid applications, but they are treated very
differently when it comes to awarding grants. How differently? The
assumption is that each year the student should be willing to
contribute 35 percent of his or her assets to the cost of
education. Only up to 5.65 percent of the assets of the parents,
though, are deemed to be available to meet the college bills. It's
for that reason that the authors of the 1999 edition of ``Paying
for College Without Going Broke'' by Kalman A. Chaney and Geoff
Mertz say (in a headline, no less), If you have any hope of
financial aid, never put money in your child's name. They cite as
an example a college savings fund of $40,000 in the parents' name
which would be assessed for up to $2,260 for the first year of
college. The same asset in the student's name would be assessed for
up to $14,000.
</P>
<P>
   One further factor that sometimes arises here is that when money
is put in the student's name, it's usually done through a uniform
gifts to minors account. More than a couple of time over the years
I've had letters from people who bitterly regret having made that
move, but for a different reason. This is because once the minor
attains majority status, the money is legally his or hers, with no
strings attached. And if it then turns out that the owner of this
money is more attracted to a motorcycle or a muscle car than
tuition bills, there's nothing that the donor can do about it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. In a recent column you mentioned that money saved for
children's education is best saved in the parent's name, as that
would increase the child's ability to obtain financial aid. Is this
true even with the new Education IRAs which allow contributions of
$500 a year and provide tax-free accumulations?
</P>
<P>
   K.M., Rancho Santa Margarita, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The editors of the book cited above, ``How To Pay for College
Without Going Broke,'' are very leery of the Education IRA. Noting
first that there had been no firm ruling on how Education IRAs will
be treated on financial aid applications, they're pretty clearly
leaning toward the opinion that they will be treated as the
student's assets. ``At the present time,'' they summarize, ``it
seems that Education IRAs are only appropriate for upper-income
families with relatively young children who are absolutely certain
they will not qualify for financial aid.''
</P>
<P>
   Note that the phrase ``upper income'' does not necessarily
relate to assets.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the numbers. If you put $500 into an Education IRA at
the start of every year and achieve 10 percent annual returns, over
the course of 12 years you would amass $10,692, and the pool will
be tax-free only if it is used for educational expenses. Suppose,
on the other hand, that a similar amount was invested in a parent's
name at the start of every year, and an amount sufficient to pay
the tax liability was withdrawn at the end of the year. After 12
years, you would have accumulated $9,050, and the student aid
formula would require that no more than $511 of it be applied to
the student's educational cost!
</P>
<P>
   So who should be attracted to the Education IRA? Primarily
people with a very substantial income level. But people with
substantial assets and moderate income would probably be better off
keeping the money in their own names. Editors Chaney and Martz cite
one case in their book to demonstrate how substantial a parent's
assets can be without disqualifying the child for aid -- that of a
person who owned a $1 million New York City apartment and a stock
portfolio worth more than $2 million, and whose daughter qualified
for a $4,000-a-year need-based grant.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am a single woman, 53, and plan on retiring in 10 years. My
current salary is $43,000 a year, and I contribute $5,000 of it to
a 401(k) program, with the money invested in T. Rowe Price's
Mid-Cap and Science and Technology funds. I also have both taxable
and tax-deferred portfolios. The taxable account includes $22,000
in Seligman's Michigan Municipal Tax Exempt fund, $3,300 in
Seligman Common Stock, $8,000 in Kemper High-Yield, $3,000 in
Kemper Small-Cap, and $12,000 in Kemper US Government Bond funds.
In an IRA portfolio I have $7,500 in Putnam Growth and Income and
$27,000 in Putnam Voyager funds. Do you think I am being too
conservative with my Seligman and Kemper investments? Why do you
anticipate the funds will amount to in 10 years?
</P>
<P>
   P.R., Auburn Hills, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, I would tend to think you're being too conservative, but
I also hesitate to suggest major changes. That's for several
reasons, but largely because conservative portfolios such as yours
tend to get that way on purpose, reflecting a limited appetite for
risk on the part of the owner. The thing that stands out to me is
that big position in the Seligman Michigan tax-exempt fund. Are you
sure that your tax bill is heavy enough so that this $22,000 is
working hard enough for you? With a 4.6 percent yield that's free
of both state and federal taxes, it seems attractive enough. But
its 10-year record of average annual total returns is 7.45 percent.
</P>
<P>
   As alternatives, you might consider two funds that would
generate taxable distributions but that would also likely offer
considerably higher total returns. One is Seligman's Income fund, a
balanced offering with 36 percent of its assets in stocks and a 4.1
percent yield. Its 10-year total return is 10.49 percent. The
second is Seligman High Yield, a junk bond fund with a 10-year
record of 11.39 percent average annual total return and a current
yield of 9.9 percent. I think that if you examine your tax
situation closely, you'd find that you would be better off at the
end of a decade on an after-tax basis if you were to switch to one
of these funds and pay the tax liabilities that are inherent in
these holdings.
</P>
<P>
   Currently I calculate the fund portfolio is 49.3 percent
invested in stocks, which also seems like a conservative number.
While you don't give a balance for your 401(k), whatever the amount
is, and all of the substantial ongoing contributions, will be in
stocks, so the total portfolio probably is nowhere near as heavily
dominated by fixed-income issues as it appears from your list. And
as I said at the outset, conservative portfolios usually don't get
that way by accident, so if you're comfortable with this, I'd say
it's fine.
</P>
<P>
   As for a growth projection, if we use an estimate of 8 percent
average annual growth within the portfolio -- based upon
expectations of about 6 percent growth from the fixed income side
and about 10 percent from the stocks -- the estimated accumulation
would be $178,758. And presuming that youve just begun the 401(k),
if we estimate 10 percent average annual portfolio gains within the
account and $5,000 annual contributions, you would amass $83,329
over the course of a decade.

UNDATED: we didn't bother. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The only thing that had our attention at that moment was what to
do next, and that is maybe the best thing about cruising as a
family: undivided quality time. No worries about dinner or driving
or cleaning.
</P>
<P>
   The Norwegian Sea docked at Cozumel, Mexico and Roatan,
Honduras. Adventurous cruisers got the creative options: A jeep to
ride in the Mexican jungle (if you're over 6); Aztec ruins to climb
(not recommended for children); and dolphins to swim with (must be
8 or older).
</P>
<P>
   Some cruise lines have changed their shore excursions to
accommodate kids, and some even offer kids-only treks into Alaska
and on some islands. We learned to explore on our own, at Wilson's
pace.
</P>
<P>
   Cruises can be affordable when you consider that meals, rooms
and entertainment are one fee. Most large lines treat children as a
``third passenger,'' meaning they are charged a rate, often $99 or
$199 per child, plus port charges, which vary.
</P>
<P>
   But the shore excursions can get pricey with children. The
Tropical Safari Jeep Tour was $68 a person, the Tulum Ruins tour
was $69, Dolphin Discovery was $87. It's another reason to try your
own thing.
</P>
<P>
   In Cozumel, we rented a taxi and took the Little Man into as
many discount jewelry stores as he could tolerate, then we sat on
the curb and watched college kids drunk on tequila navigate
scooters. Wilson was amused.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, we found Chakannaab State Park and a shallow
lagoon of purple water, where Wilson spent hours combing a
limestone reef searching for blue-legged hermit crabs and
yellow-painted sea snails. It cost us $14 admission; Wilson got in
free.
</P>
<P>
   On Roatan _ a diver's secret for 20 years and now a cruise ship
destination 30 miles off the coast of Honduras _ we spent $38 each
(children 3 and under free) for a bumpy bus ride through the jungle
to a private resort named Tabyana Beach. We spent the day under
coconut trees, on pearly sand, beside a reef second in size to the
one off the coast of Australia. The water there was so clear that
Wilson could stand and watch while schools of silver-sided
angelfish swam around him.
</P>
<P>
   Years from now, he may not remember these little things. But we
will. And that's why we'd go again. And we'd take him along.

GOP CONGRESS, CLINTON FACING NEW BUDGET STRUGGLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARIA RECIO 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Six weeks after approving a balanced federal budget
for fiscal 2000, Congress returned this week to a spending showdown
so bitter that it threatens another government shutdown.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton accused Republican lawmakers of approving a
``blueprint for chaos'' that calls for deep cuts in domestic
programs to stay within the spending limits agreed to in the 1997
balanced-budget agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority budget plan is simply not realistic,'' Clinton
told reporters in the Rose Garden after a Cabinet meeting Thursday.
``It is a blueprint for chaos, and we can do better.''
</P>
<P>
   He asked Congress to work with him on a bipartisan budget plan.
</P>
<P>
   The president, who spoke as lawmakers were taking their Memorial
Day vacation, added that a divided House has not passed any of the
13 appropriations bills that fund the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``These cuts would be so damaging that Congress itself to date
has been unwilling and unable to move some of the most basic and
normally noncontroversial spending bills out of their committee,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   But there seems to be no easy solution to the split between
Republicans and Democrats over spending priorities and between GOP
conservatives and moderates over adhering to the caps.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is how Congress can cut more than $20 billion from
current spending to stick to the fiscal 2000 spending limit of $538
billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that it is a lot easier to promise fiscal
restraint than it is to deliver on it,'' said Sen. Phil Gramm,
R-Texas, a deficit hawk for his entire congressional career.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's happening is that we all committed to a fiscal
responsibility wedding, but now people are saying, `I don't want to
go down the aisle.'''
</P>
<P>
   When it returns, the House will try to jump-start the stalled
appropriations process. Just before the recess, it did not pass the
first of the 13 appropriations bills that will keep the government
operating after Oct. 1, the start of the new fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   Why is this happening in a time of budget surplus?
</P>
<P>
   Gramm said that ``every penny'' of this year's budget surplus of
more than $100 billion is from the surfeit in the Social Security
trust fund, setting up a conflict with anyone who wants to protect
the national retirement fund.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that sticking to budget caps agreed to in the 1997
balanced budget deal, protecting Social Security by refusing to dip
into the fund, passing huge emergency spending bills and approving
tax cuts are incompatible.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem comes down to two words: spending caps. The caps
look a lot different from the vantage of surplus politics than the
perspective of deficit politics,'' said Marshall Wittmann, director
of congressional relations at the Heritage Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``When there's money to be spent, people in Washington want to
spend it,'' said Wittmann, a Waco native. ``Pigs are attracted to
slop. People in Fort Worth understand this.''
</P>
<P>
   In a speech to the Brookings Institution on Wednesday, Jacob
Lew, director of the Office of Management and Budget, complained
about the GOP plan to stay within the spending limit by boosting
defense and making deep cuts in popular domestic programs. He said
that the Labor, Health and Human Services and Education departments
would be cut by 18 percent from current levels.
</P>
<P>
   Lew said that the funding plans ``leave Congress with no
apparent alternative but to break the budget caps and spend the
surplus.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lew's advocacy of President Clinton's proposals to raise
money by increasing cigarette taxes and other fees has no GOP
support.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Lew's criticism, Gramm said, ``Other than the guy at
the top, he's the biggest double-talker in this administration.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., ranking member on the House
Appropriations Committee, told reporters, ``We're headed for
another budget train wreck.''
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, the impasse over spending was so great that House
Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., ended up agreeing to a $20 billion
increase over the limits _ a move that enraged the conservative GOP
base.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the current House speaker's effort to move the
appropriations bills, Obey said, the speaker's ``problem is that if
they try to short-circuit the problem (by raising the caps), the
right-wingers won't abide it.''
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., got a taste of that
opposition before recess when a group of conservatives stalled the
appropriations bills with a slew of budget-cutting amendments to an
appropriations bill.''

YUPPIE RALLY TURNS INTO ANTI-YUPPIE GATHERING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KEAY DAVIDSON  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A rally ostensibly organized to protect the
civil rights of yuppie newcomers to the Mission District of the
city apparently attracted just about everybody in the neighborhood
except the yuppies.
</P>
<P>
   A crowd of about 200 Mission residents, responding angrily to an
advertisement for the ``Stop the Hate'' rally, gathered to defend
themselves against what some of them called false accusations by
wealthy newcomers buying up property in their neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Mission residents should demand an end to yuppie-led
gentrification of the neighborhood, said Van Jones, one leader of
the counter-rally.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstration was held Sunday on the very spot _ by Dolores
Park _ where the original Stop the Hate rally was to be held. It
was unclear whether the original Stop the Hate rally was a hoax or
if its sponsors _ purportedly groups such as Safe Parking for
Utility Vehicles Working Group _ simply decided not to show.
</P>
<P>
   The economic boom in the San Francisco Bay area and a shortage
of housing have caused prices for homes and apartments to soar,
pitting working-class people against the more affluent in a
competition for housing.
</P>
<P>
   No one appeared to be in charge of the counter-rally. At first
it resembled a large outdoor garden party where almost everyone was
chatting amicably and greeting neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Then someone produced a megaphone, and the speeches began.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your ancestors came here to take our lands,'' shouted one
speaker, Cristianne Dugan-Cuadra, who identified herself as a
junior studying art at San Francisco State. ``We don't want you
riding your sports utility vehicles, showing off what you've got,
while kids in the Mission District aren't graduating because of
jail.''
</P>
<P>
   If any of the newcomers were around, they kept a low profile.
</P>
<P>
   The police monitored the demonstration and says there were no
fights or arrests.
</P>
<P>
   An advertisement for the rally that ran in the San Francisco
Weekly claimed that new residents of the Mission have been victims
of hate crimes and ``are treated with contempt and targeted by
vandals.''
</P>
<P>
   The ad listed a number of purported rally sponsors but gave no
addresses and listed only a single telephone number. On Sunday
after the rally, the phone number was answered by a recorded
message left by someone who called himself Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions between older, lower-income Mission residents and
wealthy newcomers have grown in recent months, with the appearance
of fliers from a group calling itself the Mission Yuppie
Eradication Project. The fliers urged residents to destroy ``yuppie
bars and restaurants.''

   NEW YORK _ Taking a bold approach to addiction, researchers at
Columbia University are offering free heroin to addicts and paying
them to use it under a federally authorized program aimed at
finding a cure for their drug habits.
</P>
<P>
   Two trials involving heroin injections are among six related
drug-addiction studies being conducted at Columbia's College of
Physicians and Surgeons, all of which focus on the role existing
medications can play in defeating drug addictions.
</P>
<P>
   Since September, 14 addicts have received regular doses of pure
heroin after being given naltrexone (pronounced nal-TREX-own),
buprenorphine (boo-pruh-NOR-fin) or methadone, which are
medications found to be effective in neutralizing heroin's high.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers want to learn whether stronger doses of these
medications are needed and can be prescribed without risk,
particularly in light of the increasingly pure heroin being sold on
the streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``A dose that was probably good enough 15 years ago may not be
good enough for heroin now,'' said Dr. Herbert D. Kleber, a
professor of psychiatry at Columbia who directs the medical
college's division on substance abuse and is medical director of
the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Heroin and cocaine have been tested on mice and other laboratory
animals. But Columbia's study is now the only one in the country
testing addicts with heroin, although researchers at Harvard have
done so and researchers at Johns Hopkins plan to.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a promising drug in animal trials,'' Kleber said,
``you need to do it in human trials to see if it adequately works,
because we're different from animals in physiology, metabolism and
the ability to report on subjective effects'' of drugs like heroin.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Marian W. Fischman, a psychologist at Columbia who studies
medications for drug abusers, said the volunteers, who agree to
stay in the hospital for six or seven weeks, had rejected offers to
treat their heroin habit. ``We would not give a drug of abuse to
someone who was seeking treatment,'' she said. ``We refer anyone to
treatment who would even moderately consider it.''
</P>
<P>
   The medications being tested affect the brain different ways.
Naltrexone is an antagonist, meaning that it blocks the effect of
heroin on the brain's receptors. Methadone is an agonist, which
stifles the craving for heroin by binding to the brain receptor.
The third, buprenorphine, acts as an agonist at lower doses and as
an antagonist at higher doses.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike methadone, naltrexone could be available with just a
doctor's prescription. But because a dose lasts only a day or so
and leaves some users feeling anxious and unhappy, many tend to
quit. Fewer than 2,000 heroin addicts nationwide take naltrexone,
compared with 115,000 methadone users.
</P>
<P>
   In one study, the researchers are experimenting with a
slow-release form of naltrexone that lasts 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   The second study, involving buprenorphine and methadone, gives
participants who have received a dose of either drug the chance to
perform laboratory tasks for heroin or for money. If the drug works
properly, the addict will logically choose the cash. But to earn a
full dose of heroin or $20, the participant must work hard, by
pushing a button as many as 11,500 times.
</P>
<P>
   The study is taking place while buprenorphine is undergoing
approval by the Food and Drug Administration. ``Buprenorphine may
have certain advantages over methadone,'' Kleber said. ``It's
longer acting, easier to withdraw from and has a ceiling effect''
on depressing breathing, he said, making it unlikely that a user
could overdose on it.
</P>
<P>
   The heroin addicts are recruited for the studies through
newspaper advertisements as well as word of mouth. Strict standards
for acceptance exclude anyone who is dependent on other drugs, was
convicted of a violent crime, is on probation or parole or has
medical or psychological problems making them unsuitable
participants. And because of the hospital time involved, the
addicts would not be able to hold a job during the test.
</P>
<P>
   The National Institute on Drug Abuse, which is financing all six
studies with $708,000 in grants this year, has issued the program a
certificate of confidentiality so that the names of participants
cannot be subpoenaed by prosecutors or the police.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to guarantee them confidentiality,'' said Kleber, who
declined to let addicts in the studies be interviewed or
photographed. According to the protocol summaries, up to half of
them are white, with the rest primarily black or Hispanic. Roughly
a third are women.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do everything possible to minimize the risks in terms of
the selection of subjects,'' Kleber said. They must be physically
healthy, from 21 to 45 years old, and dependent only on heroin, not
on other drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers are mindful of reducing the harm that heroin
users cause themselves. ``They take less drugs with us than they
would on the street, and they're being taken better care of,'' said
Kleber, who with Dr. Marc Galanter was co-editor of ``The American
Psychiatric Press Textbook of Substance Abuse Treatment'' (1994),
widely used by health professionals.
</P>
<P>
   First, the volunteers go through several days of detoxification,
in which their heroin is stopped and they are put on sufficient
buprenorphine to suppress the pangs of withdrawal. Then they are
given naloxone, a medication used by emergency room doctors to
treat heroin overdoses, to make them ready for naltrexone. Once
this is administered, they go back to heroin again to see whether
it is neutralized by the naltrexone and for how long.
</P>
<P>
   Because street heroin varies widely in purity, the National
Institute on Drug Abuse supplies the studies with pharmaceutically
pure heroin, with the approval of the Drug Enforcement
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``It is given under very safe conditions,'' Kleber said. ``We
carefully monitor the effects of drugs on the body. And they have
to keep responding on a computer to tell us how they feel.''
</P>
<P>
   The testing takes place in a small room, where the addict is
wired to a battery of machines measuring vital functions like heart
rate and blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   During the individual sessions, which last about two hours, the
addicts answer a succession of questions from the computer. Are
they yawning or sweating? Do they feel depressed, sedated or
energetic? How much would they pay for the heroin they feel, on a
scale from nothing to $20? On the street, a bag of heroin supplying
a single high costs $10.
</P>
<P>
   ``Addicts don't like to be able to take drugs in controlled
circumstances like this,'' Kleber said. ``It's not the way they
prefer to take drugs. They want to use drugs when they want, as
much as they want.''
</P>
<P>
   The addict is also asked to perform tasks, like duplicating
patterns on a computer screen. ``People who are intoxicated have an
impairment of higher functions,'' said Dr. Adam M. Bisaga, a
psychiatrist who helps supervise the tests.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers watch from behind a one-way mirror. Every 20
minutes, a researcher steps in and takes a snapshot of a
volunteer's pupil to measure the heroin's effect. (Heroin
constricts it; cocaine dilates it.)
</P>
<P>
   During their hospital stays, the addicts must attend lectures
about heroin's effects on their bodies and learn about ways to
shake the habit. ``There's potential value for them at a later date
if they decide they do want treatment,'' Kleber said. And, he
added, ``they're free to leave at any time.''
</P>
<P>
   The addicts agree to participate in the studies for $25 a day,
but if they complete the study, the amount doubles to $50 a day,
for a maximum of about $2,700 which they must pick in weekly
intervals of $300 at the hospital after the study is over.
</P>
<P>
   When the participants pick up their checks, study workers try to
counsel them to seek treatment. They are also paid for several
weeks of detoxification and preparation before the studies
officially begin.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is for staying in the hospital for six weeks, which is
something that most people don't want to do,'' Kleber said.
``There's isolation, boredom, inactivity.''
</P>
<P>
   A third study financed under the federal grant focuses on heroin
users who do want treatment. They are given naltrexone, but no
heroin, as outpatients, with a spouse or friend as a monitor.
``It's a very sophisticated approach, teaching somebody to become
part of the therapy team,'' Fischman said.
</P>
<P>
   Here, the volunteers are paid only $25 a week, plus $3 for
transportation, if they keep taking the naltrexone and produce
clean urine in a drug test. The money is given in vouchers for
food, clothes for a job interview and what Kleber called other
``pro-social'' needs.
</P>
<P>
   About 810,000 Americans regularly use heroin, according to the
White House's Office of National Drug Control Policy, and 3.6
million are regular cocaine users, but a proven cure for their
addiction has yet to be found.
</P>
<P>
   And even when an addict withdraws from heroin, a cocaine habit
often remains.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Edward V. Nunes, the investigator for the cocaine studies,
estimated that at least 25 percent of people who take methadone to
block their addiction to heroin continue abusing cocaine. ``Part of
the trouble with cocaine is convincing the patient that they need
help.'' Nunes said. ``The majority of them really dance around
it.''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, the three other Columbia studies are looking at
cocaine and how its use is affected by desipramine, an
anti-depressant; respiridone, an anti-psychotic, and memantine, a
drug marketed in Europe for dementia and Alzheimer's disease. No
cocaine is dispensed in these studies because the volunteers have
accepted the offer for treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier studies have suggested that such medications may be
useful in blocking or diluting a cocaine high.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one has been successful in developing a drug for cocaine,''
Kleber said, ``so we're looking at treatment for sub-groups'' of
addicts whose underlying emotional and mental problems may have led
them to cocaine abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Kleber said that finding a cure for drug addicts would have
spillover benefits of reducing crime and cutting welfare and
health-care costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The community should support treatment,'' he said, ``not only
because it is good for the addict but also because it's good for
the rest of us.''

BETA BLOCKERS

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. What is the beta that beta blockers block?
</P>
<P>
   A. The drugs are mainstays in the treatment of high blood
pressure and cardiac problems that can follow a heart attack. The
beta blockers, which include propranol and atenolol, slow the
heartbeat, decrease blood pressure, normalize some irregular heart
rhythms and reduce the contraction force of the heart muscle. They
work by blocking the action of the hormones adrenaline and
norepinephrine, powerful stimulants that are released by the body
during stress or exercise and that raise blood pressure and tell
the heart to beat faster and pump harder.
</P>
<P>
   More technically called beta-adrenergic blockers, the drugs
actually block a class of chemical receptors called beta nerve
receptors on the surface of cells in the sympathetic nervous system
that help control the heart.
</P>
<P>
   Unblocked, these receptors, or attachment sites for molecules,
are where adrenaline and norepinephrine normally attach to the
cells and transmit chemical messages governing the heart.
</P>
<P>
   When the beta receptor sites are blocked so that the hormones
are limited in their action, a complex change takes place in the
heart's chemical responses, according to ``The Mayo Clinic Heart
Book.''
</P>
<P>
   As the heart rate, blood pressure and force of contraction drop,
the circulatory system's need for oxygen is reduced. That is
especially helpful in people whose oxygen supply is reduced by
circulatory system disease.

GETTING WAITING ROOMS TO RUN ON TIME

<P>
   The crowd was growing larger and its mood was turning ugly.
People were muttering to each other, picking up magazines and
tossing them aside, checking their watches, snarling at the
personnel behind the check-in counter.
</P>
<P>
   Bad weather at JFK? A train out of service at Penn Station? No,
actually, this was the scene a few weeks ago in the waiting room of
the medical clinic where I work, where one of the creakiest known
systems of human processing, health care in action, had temporarily
ground to a halt.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that it was the arrival of a couple of sick people that
had jammed the works of a system intended to deal with sick people
should come as no surprise. Medical science can measure most things
these days, but one quantity remains eternally, enragingly
imprecise: how long doctors should take to do their work. The
single feat dangling permanently out of reach of the biomedical
revolution seems to be how to make the whole magnificent enterprise
run on time.
</P>
<P>
   And so waiting continues to be one of the great levelers of
health care. The lavishly insured do it and the totally uncovered
do it, on Park Avenue and at Bellevue they do it, for specialists
and for GP's, for emergencies and for checkups, for good care, bad
care, and occasionally for no care at all (``He's stuck in the OR.
Would you like to reschedule?'').
</P>
<P>
   Once, waiting was not considered a problem. The doctor's time
was of the essence; nobody else's mattered. The impoverished came
to the hospital dispensary early in the morning, a couple of
hundred at a time, and waited. The well-off came to office hours, a
handful at a time, and waited. Specific appointment times were
rare.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as efficiency, cost-effectiveness and consumer satisfaction
become prominent health care goals, the value of everyone's time is
getting a certain amount of lip service. Still some of the new
principles of patient flow might well apply to flipping burgers on
a fast-food grill. More patients mean more cash, after all, and
idle doctors mean money lost. Lavish overbooking can compensate for
costly broken appointments. The usual solution to an overbooked
waiting room and a sluggish cash flow alike: speed that doctor up.
</P>
<P>
   But the profit-making assembly line of health care never did run
smooth. A set of studies published in The Journal of Family
Practice last year showed that the more time a doctor spent with a
patient, the more satisfied with the visit the patient was,
particularly when the doctor took some time just to chat. Faster
doctors who saw more patients a day had less satisfied patients.
Their patients were also less likely to be up to date on
immunizations and important screening tests like mammograms.
</P>
<P>
   Studies have shown that patients who are generally satisfied
with their doctors are less likely to sue if something goes wrong.
Surveys from around the world confirm that the single greatest
stressor for a medical provider in the course of the day's work is
to be behind schedule. No study is needed to show that stressed
doctors do not chat.
</P>
<P>
   And so hospitals, clinics and medical offices are now creating
schedules from complicated multivariate equations that balance
cash, stress, waiting time, no-show rates, patient satisfaction,
malpractice considerations, and just incidentally, the nature of
the health care dispensed.
</P>
<P>
   All the solutions are different. My clinic recently sliced our
allotted time with each patient down to 20 minutes. This was
intended to balance out a very high rate of broken appointments so
that each of us might do better at meeting a quota of 1.43 patients
per hour _ a modest demand, actually, considering a recent United
Hospital Fund study that clocked average physician speed in New
York City at 1.9 to 3.1 patients per hour.
</P>
<P>
   On some days the new system is fine: The right number of
appointments are broken and everyone chats up a storm. On other
days the world pours in, with appointments and without, each
patient more complicated and time-consuming than the last. These
are the days of near-riot in the waiting room as doctors register
ear-popping sonic boom speeds _ 3.2, 4.7, 5.3 patients per hour.
Those hours are chat-free.
</P>
<P>
   Some patients are calling ahead now for the equivalent of a
highway traffic report. Down the hall, one of my colleagues has
stopped looking at her watch and just hopes for the best. Another
is trying to reset her internal odometer with the help of an oven
timer perched on her desk. When it dings, she winds things up.
</P>
<P>
   A third is a true subversive at heart. She works slowly, and is
rumored to lock her door on occasion, and turn off the volume on
her phone. I happen to know that she has an immersion heater and a
large stash of tea bags in a desk drawer. It gives me a certain
pleasure to imagine that sometimes when things are bad out there in
the waiting room _ the crowds howling, the receptionists pleading,
the accusations and apologies flowing thick and fast _ inside her
examining room all is serene as doctor and patient methodically
sort through a lifetime of problems over a cup of tea.

THE ZEBRA FINCH: A SONGBIRD THAT WORKS A LIFETIME TO KEEP ITS SONG
ON KEY 
</HEADLINE>
  (The Science Times) 
(HLW) 
 By HENRY FOUNTAIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Among songbirds, the zebra finch is a one-hit wonder. It learns
a tune in its youth, and then is condemned to repeat it forever,
like an aging pop star on the oldies circuit.
</P>
<P>
   But while it might be thought that having to perform, say,
``Billy Don't Be a Hero'' every night could lead to a certain
hardening of the synapses, adult zebra finches maintain flexibility
in the brain. In fact, according to a new study, that's how they
keep in shape musically.
</P>
<P>
   A young zebra finch learns through auditory feedback, listening
to its own sounds and comparing them to a song in its head until it
gets it right. Little has been known about how a mature finch, a
``closed learner'' (compared to a canary, for example, which learns
new tunes all the time) maintains its song. But earlier studies
with deafened adult finches have suggested that they use feedback
as well.
</P>
<P>
   The new research, by Anthony Leonardo, a graduate student at the
California Institute of Technology, further explores the role of
feedback, not by deafening birds but by confusing them. Leonardo
developed a computer-controlled system for recording a finch as it
sings and then playing back certain notes in time-lagged fashion.
So a bird hears a jumble of notes: its own song out of its beak,
plus the playback from a loudspeaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a couple of weeks to months, you get very dramatic
changes in the songs,'' Leonardo said. Some notes were discarded,
new ones created and others distorted. Most of all, the birds
started to stutter, repeating the same note over and over. ``To a
human, it sounds kind of like a broken record,'' said Leonardo, who
described his results in the journal Nature. Once the confusing
feedback was removed, the birds' songs returned to normal over a
period of months.
</P>
<P>
   What might be happening, Leonardo said, is that adult birds are
using feedback in much the same way that young birds do, comparing
it to what they intended to sing. ``But we're putting an error
signal into the song, and they go about correcting things, and it
just gets worse and worse,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another possibility is that the birds are not doing any error
correction at all, but rather using the feedback of one note to
prepare the next. In this case, hearing a faulty note would produce
another faulty one: garbage in, garbage out.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the experiments show that while a zebra finch might
be a one-trick pony, it is far from a dullard, retaining a large
degree of flexibility in the brain. ``The system is quite dynamic,
even in adulthood,'' Leonardo said. Perhaps graying pop stars could
take heart: it's never too late to develop a new song and hit the
comeback trail.

THE OTHER BLUME TAKES OFF

 (Retransmitting for clients)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL KENNEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Randy Blume is at the controls of a rented
Piper Warrior II, and despite the fact that it's been a few years
since she's flown single-engine four-seaters, it is clear that the
air, _ from a pilot's seat _ is her element.
</P>
<P>
   Blume is making this hop out to Fitchburg, Mass., and back to
help promote her just-published first novel, ``Crazy in the
Cockpit.'' With her worn leather flying jacket _ a souvenir from
when she flew 727s out of Guam for Continental _ tossed in a back
seat, Blume looks the part, with a face permanently weathered from
years of sitting in sun-drenched cockpits and eyes that
instinctively squint when she takes off her blue-tinted shades.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking into her classic David Clark headset, she reminds her
passenger, ``Keep a lookout for traffic, will you?''
</P>
<P>
   That's because the small Fitchburg airfield, nestled in a bowl
just outside of downtown, is ``uncontrolled,'' which means there is
no control tower to alert pilots to other aircraft in the vicinity.
</P>
<P>
   Then _ perhaps because the 5-foot-2 Blume (``barely,'' she says
ruefully) has to take one hand off the controls to pull herself up
enough to look out over the rounded top edge of the instrument
panel _ another request: ``Look out, too, will you, for a place we
can land. That's always good to know in case the engine quits.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Like a good football field?'' her passenger asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``A big plowed field is better,'' Blume replies.
</P>
<P>
   The exchange could have come right out of ``Crazy in the
Cockpit.''
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital) I filled out the landing data form and passed it to
Neil. ``There seem to be wild pigs on the runway,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wild pigs?'' he asked. ``What does that mean?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It means we should overfly the runway and take a look,''
Duncan said, scratching his armpit and then sniffing his hand.
</P>
<P>
   Neil assented, and I told (the air traffic controller) our
plans, then made an announcement on the PA explaining to the
passengers what we'd be doing.
</P>
<P>
   When we flew over the runway, and sure enough, there was a group
of pigs sitting on the tarmac.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bummer,'' Neil said, looking uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Try buzzing them off,'' Duncan suggested.
</P>
<P>
   Neil descended to 500 feet and roared across the runway.
</P>
<P>
   The pigs didn't move.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought pigs were supposed to be smart,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are smart,'' Duncan said. ``They know precisely where to
sit to block the runway.'' (end ital)
</P>
<P>
   Randy Blume, 38, is the daughter of author Judy Blume and
confesses that as a teenager she was a bookworm. That she wrote a
novel _ even a novel about a woman who chooses flying over law _
should come as no big surprise.
</P>
<P>
   But that she was the young woman who chose flight school over
law school takes some explaining. ``I knew it was totally alien to
the way I was brought up,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Blume, who now lives in Cambridge, grew up in suburban New
Jersey and, after her mother divorced and remarried, Los Alamos.
Blume's father is a New York lawyer. She says she was probably
always interested in airplanes _ ``It's what I remember from going
on vacations.'' But more to the point, halfway through high school,
she discovered adventure through an Outward Bound course. She was,
Blume recalls, the petite tenderfoot who fell over backward when
she first hitched a backpack over her shoulders. But, she adds, ``I
went from being the last person in line with people yelling at me
to catch up, (to) being the leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Kendra, her heroine pilot in ``Crazy in the Cockpit,'' discovers
the lure of flying as an assignment for a college journalism
course. ``But I didn't go into flying to have something to write
about,'' Blume says.
</P>
<P>
   It was even more serendipitous than that. During her junior year
at Wesleyan University, in Middletown, Conn., a roommate's
boyfriend reported that he had taken flying lessons over the summer
and had ``soloed.'' On the strength of just that, Blume went up for
one lesson at Hartford's old Brainard Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was cool enough that I wanted to do it again,'' she says.
``I became totally obsessed. I read flying magazines tucked inside
textbooks. I wrote all my papers about flying. And I knew that I
wanted to be an airline pilot.''
</P>
<P>
   She had her private pilot's license by the time she graduated in
1983. That summer at her mother's vacation home on Martha's
Vineyard, when she was supposed to be getting ready for law school,
she was spending all her earnings on flying magazines.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that's what you want to do . . . '' she remembers her
mother saying. ``And that was all the permission I needed,'' says
the daughter. (Judy Blume did exercise some veto power over the
choice of a flying school, looking askance at flying-magazine
advertisements that featured ``come fly with me'' bikinied young
women.)
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital) ``How could this have happened?'' my mother wailed
when I'd told her I was deferring graduate school to become a
professional pilot. ``I've sent you to the best schools. I took you
to museums, concerts, the theater. I kept the house filled with
books. I didn't let you watch TV or eat Twinkies. Where did I go
wrong?'' (end ital)
</P>
<P>
   The question of the mother-daughter relationship seems to touch
a nerve. The inevitable question: ``How much of the book is real?''
brings a carefully considered response.
</P>
<P>
   ``The flying is all true,'' she says. ``It's pretty much exactly
as it happened. It's pretty hard to make too much up in this book.
I suppose I could have, but I've flown into those towns and I've
flown those planes.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the people are composites,'' she says. ``Especially the
mother. It's very important that I say that.''
</P>
<P>
   And just as ``there are a few lines in her books that are things
that I had said,'' Blume says, recalling that Judy Blume's classic
``Blubber'' is based on an incident in school she told her mother
about, ``there are a few lines that my mother said that got into my
book.''
</P>
<P>
   But, she adds emphatically, ``the mother character is not my
mother.''
</P>
<P>
   Judy Blume, incidentally, does not like flying _ even in
commercial jets.
</P>
<P>
   Blume has flown her father, John Blume, around to legal
appointments in southern California but she has taken her mother up
only once, a spin out over San Francisco Bay. ``I think she thought
it was a mother thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Blume is divorced and is raising her son, Elliot. ``One spring
day when I was still married and living in Beverly, I grabbed
Elliot, who was 3, and took him flying with me.''
</P>
<P>
   `` `Isn't this cool?' I asked him when we came down. `I don't
see what's so cool about it,' he said. `I have to sit in my car
seat just like in the car.' ''
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital)
</P>
<P>
   In the dream, I was flying a jet for a major airline. I was the
captain, but the first officer was telling me what to do because my
uniform hat (which had been designed for a man) kept slipping over
my eyes and I couldn't see. We were flying low, over the ocean, and
it was very dark. I was nervous because I didn't know how to land a
jet, but the first officer said we wouldn't have to worry about
landing if we just flew under the water. I didn't think the
airplane was supposed to get wet, but I pushed the control wheel
forward anyway. Just as the water started to splash over the
windshield, the phone rang.
</P>
<P>
   ``Want a charter?'' It was Dale, one of the pilots for Golden
Gate Aviation . . . where I was the senior charter pilot and,
because there weren't many charters, also a flight instructor.
</P>
<P>
   (end ital)
</P>
<P>
   After 2 1/2 years of flying for Continental Airlines, Blume gave
it up in 1989 to get pregnant. ``My obstetrician asked, `How can
you get pregnant if you're away four nights a week?' I was flying
for Continental out of Newark and was pretty senior, but it wasn't
working too well for my marriage, and the airline lifestyle was not
the way I wanted to raise a child.''
</P>
<P>
   So, out of the job she loved, Blume started to write about it.
The book could have been a memoir, but publisher DK Ink wanted a
novel, and that's how it turned out.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Blume says, ``for the first time since I left, I'm really
starting to consider going back to flying. Elliot's life is stable,
he's going into second grade. I could go back to flight instructing
tomorrow, but I wouldn't make enough to pay the baby sitter. What
I'd love is to be on call for a charter company.''
</P>
<P>
   The love is still palpable as Blume reminisces for a bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first commuter job was for East Hampton Air on Long
Island,'' she recalls. ``It was a 15-seat turboprop, and I couldn't
believe they were letting me do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then at Continental, I couldn't believe that they let me
take this 727, this big fun airplane.
</P>
<P>
   ``It still holds that appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital) The interphone rang (interrupting our cockpit
waterfight), and I picked it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's going on up there?'' Milli asked. ``I've got 21 medical
emergencies, and now Paulina is crying in the galley, saying we're
all going to die. Can I get a little reassurance, please?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything's fine,'' I said, choking back hysterics. ``I can't
imagine what she's talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   And suddenly, everything was fine. We were going to get to
Honolulu, and I was going to make it to Boston. Within a few months
I would be upgrading to first officer. . . .
</P>
<P>
   By the time Diamond Head came into sight, we'd cleaned up the
cockpit and dried off as well as we could. We all had wet sticky
hair, but we were too tired to care. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``Are all Atoll Locals like this one?'' Neil asked as we taxied
to the gate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Atoll Locals are just like any other kind of flying,'' Duncan
said. ``Boring in the back, crazy in the cockpit.''
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   For Jasmine Belanger, the mysterious leg pain started about a
year and a half ago, after she had been running regularly for six
months.
</P>
<P>
   Every time she approached a distance of four miles, the muscle
in her lower right calf would start to throb, quickly becoming
excruciatingly painful.
</P>
<P>
   The peculiar thing about the pain was that it completely
vanished within minutes after she stopped running, leaving no
residual ache. And it never occurred when she cycled, did the
Stairmaster or played tennis or volleyball. Repeatedly, Ms.
Belanger, 31, a New York City investment banker, tried to ``run
through'' the discomfort.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought maybe I was just being wimpy, that it was a matter
of no pain, no gain,'' she said. ``But I couldn't do it. Once the
throbbing started, it was impossible to continue running.''
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated, Ms. Belanger consulted four different sports
podiatrists, who prescribed remedies for flat feet, weak muscles
and a leg-length discrepancy. But whenever she resumed running, the
pain came back.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Belanger's symptoms, she discovered two months ago after
consulting an orthopedic surgeon, turned out to be typical of
chronic exertional compartment syndrome or CECS, a problem that
most frequently occurs in the legs of runners and soccer players
but also in the forearms of kayakers, canoeists, rowers and
gymnasts. Bodybuilders and athletes who use anabolic steroids also
appear to be at increased risk for CECS.
</P>
<P>
   With the syndrome, the fascia, inelastic tissue that creates a
compartment around a muscle, is too small to accommodate the muscle
when it expands during exercise. As a result, pressure builds up in
the overly tight compartment, compressing nerves, cutting off blood
and oxygen supplies to the area, and, consequently, causing pain.
</P>
<P>
   According to a 1997 Australian study, as many as 3 percent of
athletes who seek the services of a sports medicine clinic have the
syndrome. Although statistics are not available for this country,
many U.S. experts think it is on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compared to 10 or 15 years ago, there is no question that we
are seeing it much more frequently,'' said Dr. Mark R. Hutchinson,
an orthopedic surgeon at the University of Illinois in Chicago. He
recently wrote about CECS for the journal The Physician and Sports
Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Among women, in particular, the problem of the syndrome may be
growing, according to a review of CECS studies from 1967 to the
present that was published in a recent issue of The American
Journal of Sports Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The chief author, Dr. Lyle J. Micheli of Children's Hospital in
Boston, noted that in his own practice he treated only eight women
for the syndrome from 1980 to 1989, while he saw 45 women with the
problem from 1990 to 1997.
</P>
<P>
   This rise is explained in part by increased participation of
women in sports. ``But we also suspect that women are more
susceptible to compartment syndrome than men, although we don't yet
know why this would be,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, it takes people anywhere from one to two years to get
a correct diagnosis. ``I think CECS is often missed because many in
the medical community don't know to differentiate between different
types of leg pain,'' Hutchinson said. ``Everything is shin
splints.''
</P>
<P>
   Shin splints, a common problem among runners, occurs when the
tendons attached to the bones of the lower leg become inflamed and
irritated.
</P>
<P>
   One of the things that distinguishes CECS from other leg
complaints is ``the leg is rarely tender and seems normal when
examined,'' explained Dr. Jo Hannafin, orthopedic director of the
Women's Sports Medicine Center at the Hospital for Special Surgery
in New York. ``Another hallmark of CECS is that symptoms vanish
completely in a matter of minutes once the activity is stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, most athletes can engage in a variety of other
sports with no trouble; only activities like running or rowing,
which put nonstop, repetitive pressure on the muscle compartments,
trigger symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   The gold standard test for the syndrome is compartment pressure
testing, Hutchinson said. A large needle attached to a small device
that measures pressure is inserted into the muscle, then readings
are taken before and after exercise. If pressure readings are
abnormally high, it is a definitive diagnosis of CECS.
</P>
<P>
   According to a recent small study, massage and stretching may
help some athletes exercise for a longer period before pain sets
in, but only surgery has been shown to cure the syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves athletes with the condition with the choice of
discontinuing the activity that causes the pain or having a
fasciotomy, surgery that slices through the fascia and releases the
muscle so it can expand freely, Micheli said.
</P>
<P>
   Performed through small incisions, the surgery is usually done
in a hospital under local or general anesthesia, and the patient
goes home the same day. The rate of success for fasciotomies in the
leg range from 75 percent to 95 percent, according to studies.
</P>
<P>
   Data on fasciotomies to the forearm are scarce, but most experts
believe the arm operation is ``just as effective as it is for the
legs,'' said Hutchinson.
</P>
<P>
   Full recovery takes at least six weeks. Ms. Belanger, who had a
fasciotomy in her right leg two months ago, has already begun
running.
</P>
<P>
   Her motivation: ``I wanted to be a senior citizen who gets up at
six in the morning and goes for a run.''
</P>
<P>
   Some experts, however, question the need for recreational
athletes like Ms. Belanger to have surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``CECS is a benign condition,'' said Dr. David Humphries, an
Australian sports medicine physician who wrote an article on the
syndrome for the medical Web site Medscape (www.medscape.com). ``I
think people who are not elite athletes would be better advised to
take up a different sport than to go through all the nonsense of
compartment pressure testing and surgery.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some do well with the advice to cross-train,'' said Dr.
Randall R. Swain, clinical associate professor of family and sports
medicine at the West Virginia University School of Medicine in
Charleston. ``But if you know most runners, then you know most
won't quit if there is a surgery that can help.''

WHO SHOULD PUBLISH RESEARCH RESULTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Wis., N.M., N.Y., Ore., N.D.)   (af)  
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The director of the National Institutes of Health
has touched off a passionate debate by proposing that scientists
disclose and disseminate on the Internet the results of biomedical
research, so the full text of their reports would be available at
no cost to anyone with a computer anywhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The director, Dr. Harold E. Varmus, said his proposal for an
electronic publishing operation, called E-biomed, would speed the
progress of science by accelerating the exchange of information
among researchers and by vastly increasing access to it.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he said, the proposed new Web site could be ``a
democratizing force'' because any legitimate researchers, ``however
remotely located or poorly known,'' could enter reports on it.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials say they hope to coordinate their Web site
with the established scientific journals, some of which have begun
electronic publishing in a limited way. But the publishers of
scholarly journals, including many scientific societies, are
predictably cool to the idea.
</P>
<P>
   They say the new system would permit researchers to bypass paper
journals and circumvent the process of peer review, by which
scientists evaluate new work before it is published, and they fear
that the NIH will become a rival that could put them out of the
publishing business or slash the revenues they derive from their
journals.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jerome P. Kassirer, editor in chief of The New England
Journal of Medicine, which has 240,000 paid subscribers, said,
``E-biomed could have a disastrous effect on clinical journals.''
He worries that ``subscribers would have no reason for
subscribing'' if they could get the contents of journals free on
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The New England Journal is owned and published by the
Massachusetts Medical Society. It has for years had a strict policy
against publishing manuscripts whose ``essential substance'' has
been published elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The American Society for Microbiology, which publishes 10
scholarly journals, and the American Physiological Society, which
has 14, express similar concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Today's scientific journals trace their ancestry to The
Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, in England, and
the Journal des Scavants, in France. Both began publishing in 1665,
with a commitment to test scientific ideas by the experimental
method.
</P>
<P>
   In the 300 years since the gold standard of scientific
communication has the publication of a paper that has been reviewed
by expert colleagues, in a scientific journal.
</P>
<P>
   Varmus proposed two compartments or divisions for the new Web
site. Articles published in the first compartment would be subject
to scientific review by members of the editorial boards of various
journals. This is the process of peer review used for decades by
The New England Journal of Medicine, The Journal of the American
Medical Association, Science, Nature, Cell, Lancet and dozens of
other journals.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, or as an alternative, Varmus said, reports could be
posted immediately on the Internet, ``prior to any conventional
peer review.''
</P>
<P>
   For their work to be disseminated in this way, Varmus said,
researchers would need to get approval from ``two individuals with
appropriate credentials.'' Such credentials, he said, ``should be
broad enough to include several thousands of scientists, but
stringent enough to provide protection of the data base from
extraneous or outrageous material.''
</P>
<P>
   Varmus described this compartment of E-biomed as a ``general
repository.'' And he said ``virtually any legitimate work'' could
be posted there ``without traditional editorial review.''
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists say, however, that E-biomed could confuse or
alarm consumers by disseminating unverified information and ``junk
science'' not reviewed by experts in the field. They acknowledge
that Web users already have access to a huge amount of medical and
scientific information of widely varying quality, but they say it
is different when the government tries to organize a system for
publishing and distributing it.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Michael M. Cox, a biochemist at the University of
Wisconsin in Madison, said, ``The publication of an electronic
journal, supported by the NIH, as described in the Varmus proposal,
is among the very worst ideas I have ever heard.''
</P>
<P>
   If it is not subject to careful peer review, ``it will
inevitably become a massive repository of taxpayer-supported
junk,'' Cox said. ``Since it will be supported or sponsored in some
way by the NIH, it will be perceived as being legitimate.''
</P>
<P>
   But the proposal gets strong support from Rep. John Edward
Porter, R-Ill., who is chairman of the House Appropriations
subcommittee responsible for the budget of the health institutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``NIH is providing wonderful leadership to the scientific
community in encouraging use of the Internet to share
information,'' Porter said.
</P>
<P>
   Subscription prices, especially for highly technical journals
sold by large commercial publishers, have risen sharply in recent
years. Libraries pay $10,000 to $15,000 a year for titles on some
subjects like brain research.
</P>
<P>
   E-biomed, as envisioned by Varmus, would offer ``instantaneous,
cost-free access'' to research reports on biology and medicine,
thus saving money for individual scientists, libraries,
laboratories and government agencies.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Physicists and mathematicians already post many of their
findings, prior to publication in a journal, on a Web site operated
by the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico (xxx.lanl.gov).
But doctors say that biomedical research, especially clinical
research, is different because it can influence the care and
treatment of patients.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Frank, executive director of the American Physiological
Society, which publishes more than 35,000 pages a year in its
journals, said a patient could be injured or killed if a doctor
prescribed a certain course of treatment based on unverified
information posted on the proposed E-biomed site.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Richard M. Glass, interim co-editor of The Journal of the
American Medical Association, said articles ``often get changed
very extensively'' as they go through the review process. Because
authors are enthusiastic about their work, he said, they often draw
conclusions that go beyond the data, and they may see new
treatments as being more effective than they really are.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, supporters of E-biomed say it could make
valuable information swiftly available to doctors, patients,
researchers and the taxpayers who pay for much of the research.
</P>
<P>
   Charles V. Mobbs, an associate professor of neurobiology at the
Mount Sinai School of Medicine, in New York City, said, ``The
taxpayer is willing to pay for our research; we have an obligation
to make the results of that research available as quickly and
efficiently as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Mobbs praised Varmus' proposal, saying it could ``revolutionize
the way in which biomedical scientists carry out their work.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said, in the electronic version of their
reports, scientists could include film sequences, three-dimensional
images and large sets of data for which there is no space in
printed journals. This would presumably make it easier for other
scientists to replicate and build on the results.
</P>
<P>
   Varmus said that all reports filed in E-biomed could be searched
with a single computerized ``search engine,'' and readers could
jump electronically, by ``hyperlinks,'' to other articles, data
bases and Web sites. In addition, he said, E-biomed could become
``a communal site'' for worldwide discussion of scientific issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``E-biomed could be the most important change in scientific
communication since the formal journal,'' Dr. David J. Lipman, a
co-author of the proposal for electronic publishing, said in an
interview. Referring to NIH's new $15.6 billion budget, he added,
``We want to get the greatest public benefit in return for that $15
billion investment. We want the most possible eyes to see the
results.''
</P>
<P>
   Lipman is director of the National Center for Biotechnology
Information, a unit of the National Library of Medicine at the NIH.
</P>
<P>
   In outlining the proposal last month, Varmus said, ``The single
greatest attraction of E-biomed is that all of its scientific
content will be available without barriers to any user with
Internet access.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the proposal profess not to be alarmed at the
potential distribution of ``junk science'' over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   One researcher who sent an e-mail comment to the NIH, Dr. Bruce
Swanson of Adelaide, Australia, drew an analogy to the spread of
literacy and printing technology in medieval Europe. ``Were all
books going to be authoritative and accurate?'' he asked. ``Were
some dangerous to society? We can imagine priests saying, `Mass
printing and wide dissemination of books is OK so long as we insure
that every book is approved by a priest review process.'''
</P>
<P>
   Other commenters worry that E-biomed would expand the role and
power of the government. ``I am adamantly opposed to any federal
clearinghouse for scientific information,'' said David H. Farrell,
an associate professor of oral molecular biology at the Oregon
Health Sciences University, in Portland.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence P. Reynolds, a professor of reproductive physiology at
North Dakota State University, in Fargo, said: ``It's intrusive for
the government to play the role it's proposing. More than that,
it's unnecessary. Journals are already beginning to publish reports
in electronic format.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Reynolds acknowledged, in many cases, the full text of
articles is available only to paid subscribers or to consumers who
pay a special fee.
</P>
<P>
   E-biomed, as described by Varmus, would have a ``governing
board'' composed of scientists, editors, computer specialists and
representatives of agencies that finance biomedical research. The
NIH would ``assemble'' the board, which in turn would develop
``rules of operation'' for the E-biomed site, Varmus said.
</P>
<P>
   Frank, of the American Physiological Society, said he worried
that the choice of board members might be influenced by politics,
and that appointments might have to be cleared through the
department of Health and Human Services.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters and critics of E-biomed agree that something like it
is probably inevitable. ``Scientific communication is going to go
electronic,'' said Anthony J. Mazzaschi of the Association of
American Medical Colleges. ``It's just a question of when and
how.''

SEARCHING FOR A PILL TO BOLSTER THE SPERM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Md., Minn., Mass., Texas)   (af)  
 By ERIC NAGOURNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With a bit of fanfare but limited hard evidence, a Maryland
pharmaceutical company has begun marketing a dietary supplement
said to improve sperm quality to couples having trouble conceiving.
</P>
<P>
   Already, even while cautioning that research is still needed to
verify the claims, some fertility specialists have begun
recommending to patients that they try the product, Proxeed. In
large part, they say, they are doing so because the active
ingredients, long used for other purposes, appear to have no
side-effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason why I do it: It's safe,'' said Dr. Jon L. Pryor, a
researcher at the University of Minnesota and director of the
Center for Men's Health and Infertility at the Fairview University
Medical Center there.
</P>
<P>
   Pryor will be among a team of doctors who will soon be testing
the main ingredients in Proxeed, which was put on the market last
week by Sigma-Tau Pharmaceuticals of Gaithersburg, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials say the product, a powder dissolved in liquid
and taken twice a day, has the potential to help couples whose
inability to conceive stems from poor quality sperm not tied to a
specific medical problem. They base the claim on a series of tests
done in Europe over the years of the supplement's two main
ingredients, L-carnitine and acetylcarnitine, natural substances
made by the liver.
</P>
<P>
   Those tests, however, were small and done with few controls, the
company acknowledges. Later this year, researchers at the
University of Minnesota and Brown University will make a more
rigorous attempt to measure how, if at all, the substances affect
sperm quality.
</P>
<P>
   The tests, however, like those done in Europe, will make no
effort to gauge whether men taking the drug have more success at
conception. Researchers said the numerous factors involved in
making a successful pregnancy made such a test impractical.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, while a prescription drug offered to treat infertility
would have to undergo a rigorous approval process by the Food and
Drug Administration, Proxeed, as a dietary supplement, has to pass
no such hurdle. FDA officials said they would be likely to get
involved only if a safety issue _ not an efficacy issue _ was
raised.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors estimate that in about 40 percent of cases in which a
couple has problems conceiving, poor sperm quality is the reason.
And in about half of those cases, the problems _ like slowness,
lack of density or misshapenness _ have no discernible cause. In
other cases, the problems may be the result of past disease.
</P>
<P>
   Even doctors who agree that the product shows potential advise
men suffering infertility problems to seek medical evaluation
before using the supplement. In some cases, fertility problems can
signal a serious disease _ including cancer.
</P>
<P>
   But once those problems have been ruled out, doctors say,
Proxeed may prove a valuable tool.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm telling my patients is that I have a drug that may
help them,'' said Dr. Larry I. Lipshultz, president of the American
Society for Reproductive Medicine. ``As far as I can see, it does
not have any downside. We've got nothing to lose except the
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Proxeed costs about $95 month. But many seem eager to try it.
Brad Stewart, Sigma-Tau's executive director of consumer products,
said the company had received thousands of calls about Proxeed,
most of them from women.
</P>
<P>
   Among the men trying the product is Glenn W. Armbruster, a
patient of Lipshultz from Houston. Armbruster, 29, a computer
analyst, said he and his wife had been trying to have a baby since
1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything out there that offers any bit of help is worth
trying, in my opinion,'' he said.

AT NEARLY 6 BILLION, WE CAN'T AFFORD TO FORGET EARTH'S POPULATION
PROBLEM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JACK Z. SMITH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It took thousands of years, from the dawn of civilization till
the 19th century, for the world's population to reach 1 billion
people.
</P>
<P>
   But by this fall, probably sometime around mid-October, planet
Earth will be home to 6 billion humans.
</P>
<P>
   In the years since John F. Kennedy was elected president in
1960, the global population has virtually doubled.
</P>
<P>
   These population figures aren't any pie-in-the-sky numbers from
some alarmist environmental group. The statistics come from the
U.S. Census Bureau, based on a variety of expert sources on world
population.
</P>
<P>
   It's becoming increasingly obvious that the world is getting too
crowded. Its resources are being taxed like never before.
</P>
<P>
   The results of mushrooming population are painfully evidenced by
escalating traffic gridlock in fast-growing U.S. cities and
suburbs; increasingly restrictive governmental policies such as the
Chinese government's dictate limiting families to a single child;
diminished air quality in pollution-choked metropolises such as
Mexico City; denuded forests that contribute to environmental
disasters such as last year's massive flooding of China's Yangtze
River; the extinction of animal species in South America and Africa
due to loss of habitat; and increasingly pinched water resources in
exploding western U.S. cities such as Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   It all makes me wonder: What kind of planet are we leaving our
grandchildren, with the world's population expected to grow another
50 percent by 2050, to approximately 9 billion people?
</P>
<P>
   Let's get something straight. I'm not predicting the collapse of
civilization. But I think there's the potential for us to seriously
erode our quality of life and do major environmental damage if we
keep adding billions more people to the planet.
</P>
<P>
   I already can see the effect of mushrooming population on the
decisions I make in my personal world.
</P>
<P>
   I'm now more reluctant to leave Fort Worth and drive to places
such as north Dallas or Austin just because of the increasingly
congested traffic I'll face on roads like the LBJ Freeway or
Interstate 35. We can't expand highways fast enough to keep up with
the population growth.
</P>
<P>
   I had always planned to travel to Mexico City someday. Now, with
its 20 million people choking on polluted air and mired in traffic
jams, I've got no desire to go.
</P>
<P>
   My longstanding concern about spiraling population, and its
impact on the environment, was a factor in my deciding to have only
two children. It also influenced my decision to drive a small,
fuel-efficient car. And it's part of the reason I fill up my
recycling bin every week.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't meant to be any sanctimonious criticism of people who
don't live like I do. I personally know a number of first-rate
human beings who have four or five children, or drive a lumbering
Suburban, or consider recycling too big a hassle.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a lack of public awareness of the negative effects
of overpopulation, it's understandable. My profession deserves much
of the blame for that. While the news media devotes barrels of ink
and countless hours of air time to the Monica Lewinskys of the
world, we often bury stories explaining how exploding population
contributes to environmental deterioration and diminished living
standards.
</P>
<P>
   I bet you know how Monica got that stain on her now-famous blue
dress. But you were probably much less likely to have been informed
about how the overpopulation of China has contributed heavily to
deforestation in that country's Yangtze River basin, which in turn
contributed to severe flooding that killed more than 3,000 people,
dislocated millions of others and caused more than $30 billion in
losses last year.
</P>
<P>
   Overpopulation has become such a concern in China that the
government is now directing families to have only one child. I hope
that the problem of overpopulation can be solved by educating
people throughout the world about the need for intelligent,
voluntary family planning and by making certain that contraceptive
services are available to those who want them. (This need is
particularly acute among poor women in many Third World countries.)
</P>
<P>
   The more we continue to overpopulate the planet, the more likely
it is that governments throughout the world eventually will impose
severe restrictions on everything from family size to the amount of
water that each person consumes. That means a decline in both
individual freedom and quality of life.
</P>
<P>
   Is this the kind of world we want for our grandchildren?
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   JAZINCE, Macedonia _ Monday was the latest of the dark days for
refugee Xhemil Ismani, who woke up with his bags packed to go back
home to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   First, he heard on BBC radio that NATO's negotiations with
Yugoslav generals to end the fighting in Kosovo had collapsed
overnight. Then, he discovered the war had expanded to breach his
safe haven here in Macedonia, with the shelling of this Macedonian
village from Serb-held Kosovo province.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they have some few last bombs to spend. They know this
is a war they are losing. Now they are trying to destroy everything
that is Albanian -- the houses, the people, the children,
everything,'' said Ismani, 41, an English teacher who had come to
see if friends here made it safely through the attack. He lives a
few miles down the road with a family who
</P>
<P>
   gave him refuge in nearby Tetovo.
</P>
<P>
   The assault on Macedonia was a shocking rarity. While
Yugoslavia's Serb-controlled military have repeatedly attacked
positions next door in Albania where the rebel Kosovo Liberation
Army is quartered, Yugoslavia has tried not to fray its more
friendly relations with Macedonia -- which has absorbed nearly a
quarter-million of Kosovo's ethnic Albanian refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the attack was an angry, unsanctioned outburst by rogue
Serb soldiers, or a calculated message related to the collapse of
peace talks, the two events did happen almost simultaneously at
about 3 a.m. (local time) Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Ismani was among the score or more of people drawn to this
normally subdued rural village Monday afternoon to gawk at the
holes in roofs, shrapnel-pocked walls and two-foot-wide dents in
the earth made by the ordnance that Macedonian police here believe
was fired from a Serb military outpost just over the border. No
injuries were reported, though several houses were hit.
</P>
<P>
   Ismani, who had hoped the talks would make it safe to go home
within days, was frustrated at seeing his planned return to the
Kosovo town of Urosevac aborted. And the Macedonian villagers here
were fretting that they might have to become refugees, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had a chance, I would find a safer place for my
children,'' said Mustafa Abdiseljam, 56, whose red tile roof was
disfigured by a blackened hole about a yard in diameter.
Fortunately for his family of 12, the explosive blew into an
unoccupied second-floor sitting room.
</P>
<P>
   He believes the failure of the talks was related to the attack
on this ethnic Albanian village, a simple place where horses draw
haycarts down narrow bricked streets and many make do without
indoor plumbing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a demand to stop the war in Kosovo. The next thing
we know, Macedonian villages are being bombed,'' said Abdiseljam,
who showed journalists the sitting room where wooden roof beams had
crashed onto floor cushions. Intricate needle-point renditions of
flower bouquets were intact on the walls.
</P>
<P>
   He refused to tell a journalist where his family would sleep
Monday night. ``I'm afraid Serb forces will come here and massacre
my family,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other villagers and refugees said this is just one more example
of how the Serb-dominated Yugoslav leadership and Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic can never be trusted. They voiced
doubts that Yugoslavia will live up to any agreement and fears that
Macedonia will be drawn into fighting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the Serbs are lying. Even if they sign a (peace)
document, they will do the same things,'' said Enver Tusha, whose
family has been staying in a house next door to Abdiseljam's. His
family ran outside when the first explosion hit, and Tusha said he
saw the explosives arrive in a low arc from the direction of the
Yugoslav military outpost.
</P>
<P>
   Besim Nesimi, commander of the border police here, said all
evidence points to the Serbs as launching the attack, but he
refused to detail the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no room for thinking,'' he said. ``I am sure of it.''

MIAMI CAB COMPANY TRAVELS WHERE OTHERS FEAR TO TRED 
</HEADLINE>
  (rm) 
 By RICK BRAGG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ On a slow Sunday morning, with a warm rain drumming
softly against the iron awnings of the last taxi company in Liberty
City, Al Hooks and Charles Richardson stood on a sidewalk and
counted off the men who were shot to death while driving for
Society Cab.
</P>
<P>
   ``Robert Pollack, got killed at 85th Street and 14th Court, and
King Ballard, on 82d Street and 15th Street,'' said Hooks, a
manager and 30-year veteran at Society Cab who was shot in the
stomach in a robbery in 1984. ``Pinkney, at 83rd and 14th Avenue.
He called for help. And Mereday, 31st and 59th. And Willie Jackson,
924d and 334d. Henley Beecham was the last one, January, 17th and
51st Street.''
</P>
<P>
   The men could not recall all the names of the drivers who were
killed in robberies in the last 20 years. But being cab drivers,
they remembered the cross-streets. ``There might be another one,''
said Hooks, glancing at Richardson for help.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson, who has been shot in the shoulder and stabbed in the
chest with an ice pick in his 40 some-odd years of driving for
Society, shook his head. ``More than I care to remember,'' he said.
Then, for a moment, there was only the thump of rain and a ringing
phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taxi service,'' answered the dispatcher, Mattie Hunter, like
there was nothing special about it at all.
</P>
<P>
   Society Cab has become more than a taxi ride in some of Miami's
black communities. In a part of the city where taxi drivers must
carry change for a quarter because even a dime is more than most
people can tip, the drivers are the only ones who regularly answer
calls in Miami's harshest neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a piece of county legislation may do what gunfire could
not. In response to constant complaints from tourists that
Miami-Dade taxis are old, ugly and filthy, the county commission
has enacted a new taxi law that could gradually do away with older
cabs like the ones in Society's fleet of 23.
</P>
<P>
   In a neighborhood where people labor for minimum wage and taxi
drivers regularly settle for what people have in their pockets,
drivers cannot afford new taxis. Society's drivers have asked for
an exemption, but county officials have balked so far, but were
expected to consider that exemption this week. Without it, say the
drivers, Society will fade from existence.
</P>
<P>
   The black and mint-green cabs have been running for 50 years,
through riots and gang warfare, serving Liberty City, Overtown,
Opa-Locka, Carol City and other places, an area of tens of
thousands of people where gunfire is sometimes more consistent than
bus service, and crime is the cross people bear. They do it to make
a living, said drivers who work here, and because this is their
home, too. It may seem like a battle zone, but it is also a place
where mothers work two jobs, where old people go to church, said
Richardson. He knows, because he drives them there.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people here could do better, they wouldn't live here, but
they are here,'' said the 61-year-old Richardson. ``What are the
good people gonna do if we're not here? The other cab companies,
they don't even come out here.''
</P>
<P>
   The tourists who complained about taxis have almost certainly
never ridden in a Society cab. These cabs do not work the airports,
do not travel across the causeways to Miami Beach. They work 79th
Street and Little Haiti, and a dozen housing projects known only by
their street names, like Pork 'n' Bean Project, and an area people
here just call the Graveyard.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 40 or so drivers at Society Cab, the only black-owned,
black-operated taxi company in Miami-Dade County, most have been
shot or been shot at, or stabbed, or choked. Some, like Richardson,
still have the bullet inside them, and some, like Hooks, have left
bullets inside other people. At least 90 percent of them have been
robbed, and many cabs are dented from thrown rocks.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin ``Dark 'n' Lovely'' Scott holds the record for bullet
wounds among Society cabbies, with nine. His wounds forced him into
semi-retirement.
</P>
<P>
   All the drivers, women and men, are black. The only Hispanic
driver to ever work for Society was robbed and locked in the trunk
of his car, in his first week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been shot,'' said 62-year-old Daniel Ponder. ``But
I did have to shoot a man once.'' Most drivers are armed, because
they work too hard, they say, to give their earnings over to a
crackhead with a dime-store knife.
</P>
<P>
   Often, they get calls from other cab companies, saying they have
a fare who wants to go to Liberty City or elsewhere in the inner
city. ``The other company takes them to Biscayne Boulevard,'' the
bayside street that a great many Miamians regard as a sort of fence
between safety and risk, Hooks said. ``We take them from there.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   They see themselves not so much as cab drivers as ferrymen,
carrying their fares along treacherous rivers of asphalt, avoiding
the street corners where chunks of concrete and bullets fly out of
nowhere. Over time, the taxi service has become such a respected
part of the community that mothers trust drivers to take their
children to grandmothers, day care, schools and, sometimes, the
emergency room at Jackson Memorial Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The drivers routinely work for just a promise of payment, or
part of it. On a recent weekend, veteran driver Clyde Bain drove a
young woman more than 40 blocks to her data-processing job in North
Miami, fighting a downpour and wildly weaving traffic on Interstate
95. The meter showed $17.50. He took $17, no tip.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know her. She works. She has kids,'' said Bain, a native of
the Bahamas whose daughter will graduate from the University of
Miami this spring. ``If she's making minimum wage,'' he said of his
fare, ``then this ride cost her three hours work.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Miriam Fasze, 19, gets off work at her job in a North Miami
office at 4:30 a.m. ``I can't get a ride home from the other
companies,'' she said. ``They're afraid.''
</P>
<P>
   A bus ride would take three or four hours, and no one, said
Bain, stands at a bus stop in inner-city Miami at 4:30 in the
morning.
</P>
<P>
   He has been robbed just twice, but two drivers have died in cabs
he owned. It seems like too much risk for too little reward, but
Bain said that is a matter of perspective. People who live in
safer, nicer worlds, he said, would see it as foolish. But he has
raised a family with dignity, and every day the wheels of his taxi
turn, they bring other working people closer to that dignity.
</P>
<P>
   The sad truth, he said, is that most Miamians will not miss the
drivers if they are put out of business, because they do not know
they exist.
</P>
<P>
   ``They never see an area like this,'' said the 56-year-old Bain,
who has been driving for 20 years. ``They hit the expressway and
pass us by. They don't know that there are hard-working people,
trying to raise kids, to just eat. They think everybody out here is
trying to rob and steal.''
</P>
<P>
   His cab splashes through the heart of Liberty City, through
streets lined with tiny homes with postage-stamp yards, past
abandoned stores, past store-front churches with spray-painted
crosses and one that offers in neat letters, ``The Way, The Truth,
The Life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It may not seem like a lot,'' he said, referring to the
struggle he sees going on here, and his role in it. ``But it is.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The company pre-dates this new, troubled Miami.
</P>
<P>
   It began in 1949, Hooks said, with a ``phone on a post,''
outside the now-closed Cafe Society on Northwest 20th Street and
Third Avenue. From then into the 1960s, Miami's black neighborhoods
rang with music from high-end dance clubs, where Cab Calloway
shouted ``Hidie-Hidie-Hey,'' and Sammy Davis Jr. danced in a haze
of cigarette smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Society Cab was part of it. Its original owners painted a top
hat, cane and white gloves on their doors, promising that ``before
you can get your hat, cane and gloves, the cab is there,'' Hooks
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was Cafe Society, Harlem Square, Rockland Palace, Sir
John's, the Mary Elizabeth, the Night Beat,'' all gone, Hooks said.
``The riots killed them.''
</P>
<P>
   They folded in the violence that would become shorthand for
Overtown and Liberty City, for decades. First there were the riots
after the killing of Martin Luther King Jr., in 1968, the McDuffie
riots _ sparked by the killing of a black man by the police _ in
the 1980s, and the more recent drug wars that left gang members and
innocent bystanders bleeding in the streets.
</P>
<P>
   All the other black-owned cab companies folded. Buses ran only
when it was safe. But Society kept running, Hooks said.
</P>
<P>
   Crack cocaine changed everything in the mid-1980s, as it did in
other inner cities, as addicts fed their habits with anything they
could steal. Society's cabs became targets, and life in the
driver's seat of the Ford Crown Victorias and Chevrolet Caprices
became much cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   On Mother's Day 1994, three young men climbed into Al Hooks' cab
at 14th and 65th. He drove awhile, until one man shoved a gun at
him and said, ``OK, Papa, give it up,'' Hooks said.
</P>
<P>
   ``So,'' he said, ``we had a confrontation. He shot me once in
the stomach. I shot him in the chest. Bullet ripped me all open.''
</P>
<P>
   In the trauma unit, the police asked him if he could describe
his adversary. ``I looked over beside me and said, `There he is.'
''
</P>
<P>
   The man was lying next to him.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson's most terrifying attack was in 1970, when a man who
sat in the back seat mumbling to himself reached across the seat,
circled an arm around his throat and drove an ice pick into his
chest.
</P>
<P>
   The two men fought in the cab, then out the door, with the car
still rolling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We fought in the street,'' said Richardson, who finally got to
his radio and called for help. He did not call the police, but the
cab company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Family,'' explained Hooks.
</P>
<P>
   The cabs swarmed there. They did it when Al Hooks went down in
1984, and when Franklin ``Dark 'n' Lovely'' Scott was shot last
year. They even carried him to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few years, the drivers tend to pick up people they
know by sight, or by address. Many of them pass strangers by, and
pick up passengers who have grown old with the company, or at least
grown familiar.
</P>
<P>
   The drivers like Hooks and Bain are proud that their hard work
paved the way for a better life for their families, but they like
to believe it gives others, people they know only by address, a
push in that direction.
</P>
<P>

INJECTION OF CELLS AIDS MICE

 (Attn: Mass.)   (af)

<P>
   In a possible glimpse at the brain surgery of the future,
biologists have partly cured mice of a disease resembling multiple
sclerosis by injecting restorative cells into their brains.
</P>
<P>
   The cells migrated all over the brain and took the correct
action to repair the neural disease, in this case a lack of the
sheath that covers certain nerve cells and helps speed their
conduction of electrical signals.
</P>
<P>
   The approach is founded on the use of stem cells, the special
regenerative cells with which organs renew and repair themselves.
Dr. Evan Y. Snyder and his colleagues at Harvard Medical School
worked with neural stem cells, the progenitor cells that develop
into all of the other specialized cells of the brain.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder said that his experiment showed, in principle, that
neural stem cells can migrate all over the brain and develop into
the right kinds of specialized cells. Hence human neural stem cells
could serve to treat diseases that affect the whole brain, like
Alzheimer's and multiple sclerosis.
</P>
<P>
   The subjects of Snyder's study, which was reported in Tuesday's
issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, were
``shiverer'' mice, so called because they shiver uncontrollably
throughout their generally short adult life.
</P>
<P>
   The mice's problem is a mutation in the gene that makes myelin,
the material that sheathes the long extensions of certain nerve
cells. Because the gene is disrupted, the oligodendrocytes, the
special cells that do the cladding, are ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   In his experiment, Snyder injected neural stem cells from a
normal mouse into newborn shiverer mice, into the brain region from
which the stem cells originate. The new stem cells spread all over
the brain, transformed themselves into oligodendrocytes and churned
out myelin to wrap around the cells.
</P>
<P>
   The shivering abated in more than half the treated mice, and
some seemed fully normal.
</P>
<P>
   It was long thought that people die with the same set of brain
cells that they are born with. But recent findings have shown that
new brain cells are continually created from neural stem cells, at
least in certain regions of the brain. Snyder believes that neural
stem cell activity may be quite high in normal adult brains and
even higher in diseased brains.
</P>
<P>
   Even if neural stem cells do not migrate much in the adult
brain, it may be possible to equip them with genes that reawaken
the migratory instincts of their youth, Snyder believes. Stem cells
are particularly amenable to genetic manipulation.
</P>
<P>
   For a next step, he plans to repeat his experiment in adult
mice, then perhaps with monkeys, and then in an appropriate
clinical setting. Snyder envisions a new approach to many brain
diseases, based on the use of neural stem cells. ``It's very
conceivable that within this decade we will have a genuine
contribution to make to brain repair,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder's optimism is shared by other biologists who work on stem
cells, both in the brain and other organs, and who see themselves
as opening up a new field of medicine based on the body's own
repair system. The use of stem cells, together with the signals
that control the cells' behavior, is sometimes known as
regenerative medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do believe this represents a paradigm shift, that it's a
whole new way of repairing the brain by trying to invoke
fundamental principles of brain development,'' Snyder said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ron McKay, a neural stem cell expert at the National
Institutes of Health, said Snyder's experiment was ``pretty
impressive'' in showing how much of the shiverer mouse brains could
be re-sheathed in myelin. It proved the concept, he said, that if
neural stem cells are injected at the right stage in the brain's
development, they will develop into the appropriate kind of
specialized cell. ``I am utterly confident in the correctness of
the conclusion,'' he said.

IT'S HIGH-STAKES MUSICAL CHAIRS, AS ORCHESTRAS SEEK NEW LEADERS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES R. OESTREICH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Cleveland Orchestra announced on Monday that Franz
Welser-Moest would become its music director in 2002 on the
departure of Christoph von Dohnanyi, who has held that position
since 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Dohnanyi, who is 69 and is also the principal conductor of the
Philharmonia Orchestra of London, revealed two years ago that he
intended to resign, saying he wanted to give the orchestra time to
make an orderly transition. Welser-Moest, a 38-year-old Austrian,
has been the music director of the Zurich Opera since 1995 and was
the music director of the London Philharmonic from 1990 to 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the Cleveland Orchestra, on the eve of the annual
conference of the American Symphony Orchestra League, which begins
on Wednesday in Chicago, is the first out of the blocks in a race
among several top ensembles in the United States and abroad to snap
up the choice candidates in what is considered a limited field.
</P>
<P>
   The Philadelphia Orchestra is looking to replace Wolfgang
Sawallisch, who announced a decision similar to Dohnanyi's but
plans to stay until a successor is in place. The New York
Philharmonic has impressed its own desire for an orderly transition
on Kurt Masur, whose current contract expires in 2002. The Berlin
Philharmonic, meanwhile, in its search for a successor to Claudio
Abbado in 2002, is said to have refined the list of candidates to
Daniel Barenboim and Sir Simon Rattle, with Barenboim expected to
carry the vote this month.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland's choice is sure to raise the perennial issue of the
paucity of American music directors among major American
orchestras. ``We were looking for somebody well grounded in the
classical traditions of this orchestra as well as someone to lead
it into 21st century,'' said Thomas W. Morris, the orchestra's
executive director. ``That was the sum total of the requirements.
Being an American was not one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cleveland Orchestra has employed more American conductors
than most in recent decades, with Lorin Maazel the music director
from 1972 to 1982 and Leonard Slatkin the director of its Blossom
Festival from 1991 through this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Welser-Moest's appointment comes as no surprise. He was said to
be a candidate for the music directorship of the St. Louis
Symphony, assumed by Hans Vonk in 1996, and his name has arisen in
speculation about Cleveland and Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   But Welser-Moest's most closely analogous experience, with the
London Philharmonic, was far from untroubled. Though widely
respected as a musician, he was scarred by administrative battles
in a tense and politicized atmosphere as the city's five major
orchestras jockeyed for adequate shares of shrinking financing. The
London Philharmonic was in particular administrative disarray, and
no successor to Welser-Moest was announced until last November,
when Masur was named principal conductor as of next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Cleveland offered me the job, I was more than thrilled,''
Welser-Moest said on Monday. ``The Cleveland Orchestra has always
been very special.''
</P>
<P>
   He has committed, in a five-year contract, to spend 16 to 18
weeks a season with the orchestra, some 50 percent more than
Dohnanyi does now. He plans to curtail his activity at the Zurich
Opera, where his contract calls for two new productions and 35
performances a season, he said. ``At the moment,'' he added, ``I am
fulfilling that contract exactly 200 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   So with one seat suddenly occupied in a high-stakes game of
musical chairs, the Cleveland Orchestra has undoubtedly set the
agenda for informal discussion at the conference in Chicago.

<TEXT>
<P>
   A delicate but destructive machine, a kind of molecular power
drill deployed by tumors to punch their way through the body's
compartments, has been visualized for the first time by biologists
at Sweden's Karolinska Institute.
</P>
<P>
   The power drill exists not for the benefit of tumors, though
they exploit it, but for normal remodeling of the tough walls that
surround the body's main organs and tissues. The wall, a matrix
made mostly of collagen fibers, needs to be degraded from time to
time: when the organism is growing or when wounds have to be
repaired. So cells known as fibroblasts, which also make the
matrix, are equipped with a miniature power drill for busting holes
in it.
</P>
<P>
   This tool has long been of interest to cancer biologists because
it provides the escape mechanism for tumors to spread from one part
of the body to another. Tumor cells intent on breaking out from the
organ where they originate can apparently trick the fibroblast
cells into their matrix destruction mode.
</P>
<P>
   Like most of the body's molecular machines, the power drill is a
protein woven from a single ribbon of atoms. The ribbon is
precisely coiled and pleated in ways that confer specialized roles
on each of its separate regions or domains.
</P>
<P>
   The precise anatomy of the power drill protein has been brought
to light by Dr. Karl Tryggvason of the Karolinska Institute in
Stockholm, together with colleagues there and at the University of
Exeter in England. From their work, published in Science, the main
components of the miniature machine can be recognized, although
much remains to be understood about its operation.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly for so destructive a device, the machine has a
guard plate that shrouds its active center. Only when the guard
plate is cut away can the machine chew up matrix. Next is the
active center, which is not literally a drill but rather a
specialized catalytic device for cutting collagen.
</P>
<P>
   Further along the ribbon are three regions known as fibronectin
domains. Their purpose is not known for sure but they may serve as
claws to bring the collagen fiber to the active center.
</P>
<P>
   At the tail end of the ribbon is a complex domain that seems in
part to be the machine's off-switch because it is activated by
substances that are known to shut the power drill down. But the
domain may also have a role in helping to home in on the collagen
fibers.
</P>
<P>
   The power drill protein is secreted, in inert form, by the
fibroblasts, but these cells carry on their surface a cutting
device that activates the protein by severing its guard plate area.
</P>
<P>
   Tryggvason said he became interested in the protein 20 years ago
when trying to understand how a spreading tumor managed to cross
the matrix wall. Working as a postdoctoral student at the National
Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md., he and a colleague first
purified the protein in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   It is known to biologists as matrix metalloproteinase-2, metallo
referring to the zinc atom that is part of its collagen-chewing
maw, and 2 because it is part of a family of 16 proteins that
remold connective tissue. The specialty of matrix
metalloproteinase-2 is chewing up collagen IV, the type of collagen
that is the main component of the extracellular matrix.
</P>
<P>
   To visualize the protein's working parts, Tryggvason had to make
it form regular crystals that could be X-rayed so as to reveal the
twists and turns of its backbone ribbon. Biologists have been
trying to snap the protein's X-ray picture for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is extremely difficult to crystallize,'' Tryggvason said.
The reason is that the protein is not only good at chewing up
collagen but chews itself up too. Many attempts to make crystals
triggered the self-destruct mechanism.
</P>
<P>
   Tryggvason succeeded by synthesizing a mutant form of the human
protein, one in which the active center was permanently disarmed by
making a minute change in the DNA of the gene that specifies its
structure.
</P>
<P>
   Other metalloproteinases are also involved in the breakout of
tumors, and drugs that inhibit them have been developed as an
anti-cancer strategy. But patients developed serious side effects
after several months.
</P>
<P>
   Biostratum, a privately held company co-founded by Tryggvason
and located in Research Triangle Park, N.C., said it hoped to
develop a drug that would inhibit matrix metalloproteinase-2 alone,
curbing tumor growth with fewer side effects than the drugs that
inhibit all metalloproteinases.

HIGH ENERGY DRINKS AND SNACKS FUEL ATHLETES
</HEADLINE>
  Includes color photo of a whitewater kayaker with a sport drink 
 By CLIFTON DANIEL 
 c.1999 New York Times Regional Newspapers 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When competitive runner Gray Fore goes for a relatively short,
five-mile jaunt, she travels light, toting nothing more than a
bottle of water.
</P>
<P>
   But when training dictates a two-hour, 15-mile run, she prepares
like an astronaut on a moon mission, loaded down with energy bars,
power gels and sports drinks, which she munches and guzzles at
intervals along the way.
</P>
<P>
   ''It might just be all in my mind, but they definitely help,''
said Fore, of Wilmington, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Sports drinks, now available in a range of neon colors, are in
demand these days _ and not just from serious athletes. Even casual
runners, cyclists and sports enthusiasts are looking for ways to
boost their body's power and endurance.
</P>
<P>
   Tagging along for the race are an assortment of concentrated
''sports snacks,'' as well, such as the PowerBar and its ilk _ an
assortment of granola-like energy bars and gels designed to give
runners and cyclists a boost. MUNCH ON
</P>
<P>
   Before a 13-mile run, Fore stokes her furnace with a PowerBar, a
flat, 4-inch slab of oat bran, pear juice concentrate and a slew of
other, unpronounceable ingredients like maltodextrin, a complex
carbohydrate.
</P>
<P>
   Like most things that are good for you, the bars aren't close to
delicious. As the joke goes, the chief ingredient is sawdust. Some
brands, including PowerBar's Harvest Bar and the Clif Bar, are
designed to taste better, with flavors that include chocolate chip
cookie dough.
</P>
<P>
   But granola bars can be hard to digest, so every five miles into
a long run, Fore refuels with ''power gel,'' a high-energy goop
with nutritional properties similar to a PowerBar but with the
texture of fruit-flavored icing.
</P>
<P>
   Runners and cyclists often stash their food and drinks at set
locations along their route, carry fanny packs or bike bottles, or
carry packets of power gel in special pockets in their running
shorts. HYDRATE YOUR THIRST
</P>
<P>
   Fore fell in love with power drinks after being offered an
ice-cold, cherry Powerade after a race.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let me tell you, that stuff was fantastic,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   For exercise lasting over an hour, sports drinks' blend of
carbohydrates and electrolytes will enhance performance for
athletes _- even weekend athletes. Carbohydrates are for energy,
and electrolytes such as sodium and potassium maintain fluid
balance.
</P>
<P>
   Dehydration, say health and fitness experts, is a real threat to
athletes, and can cause fatigue, headaches and muscle cramps. After
all, on warm days, you can easily lose a pound of water during a
half-hour of running.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid dehydration, someone engaged in strenuous exercise
should drink about 5 to 12 ounces every 15 to 20 minutes, according
to a report by the American College of Sports Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Other findings: The day before a race or workout, eat well and
drink plenty of fluids. Two hours before a race or workout, drink
around 16 ounces of fluid.
</P>
<P>
   During exercise, drink early and often. Go for cool, tasty
beverages. You'll drink more. (Avoid soda or fruit juice, however.
They aren't diluted enough.)
</P>
<P>
   After exercising, drink extra fluids even beyond your feelings
of thirst. GO, GATORS
</P>
<P>
   Gatorade is the granddaddy of sports drinks and rules what's
called the ''active thirst market'' with a 79.4 percent share,
according to Beverage Digest. The closest competitors are Powerade,
with 11.2 percent of the market, and All Sport, with 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Born of necessity in 1965, Gatorade was conceived when coaches
for the University of Florida football team noticed their players
were flagging during the second half of every game.
</P>
<P>
   College researchers analyzed team members' sweat to see what
vital nutrients players might be losing. They came up with a
concoction that contained sodium, potassium and carbohydrates
(sugars and starches) _ all essential to muscle performance.
</P>
<P>
   Sodium also helps the body absorb carbohydrates. And it spurs
athletes to drink more, which helps speed rehydration, said Don
Printy, dietitian for New Hanover Regional Medical Center in North
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ''A sports drink provides the perfect 'twofer' before, during
and after a run,'' says Liz Applegate, in ''Runner's World''
magazine. ''It hydrates and energizes you.''
</P>
<P>
   The original Gatorade tasted like nothing so much as salty
water. Legend has it that a coach's wife added lemon or lime to the
mix to make it more palatable.
</P>
<P>
   Thereafter, the newly energized Gators became known as the
''second-half team.'' When they beat Georgia Tech in 1967, Tech
coach Bobby Dodd was supposed to have said: ''We didn't have
Gatorade and that's what made the difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Stokely-Van Camp bought the formula and started marketing the
drink as Gatorade in 1967. Quaker Oats Co. took over Stokely-Van
Camp, and Gatorade, in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Gatorade alone brings in $1.5 billion per year in sales. The
beverage's biggest threat comes not from another sports drink
company, but from Mother Nature. ''Water is one of Gatorade's
biggest competitors,'' said Gatorade spokeswoman Jill Kinney.
</P>
<P>
   A recent study, however, shows that taste may be winning out
over convenience.
</P>
<P>
   Texas A&AMP;M researcher and physiologist Jack Wilmore collaborated
with the University of Western Australia for a study that pitted
water against sports drinks. During and after a 90-minute workout,
runners were allowed to drink as much as they wanted. They drank
over 50 percent more sports drink than water.
</P>
<P>
   Capitalizing on this search for flavor, sports drinks _ which
used to be available only in generic lemon-lime _ now come in
exotic flavors and neon colors, such as All Sport's Extreme
Watermelon and Gatorade's Whitewater Splash. THE COST OF A BOOST
</P>
<P>
   Keeping your energy up isn't cheap, at least not compared with
pennies-per-gallon tap water. A gallon of Gatorade, the priciest of
the sports drinks, sells for about $4. Athletes might do better
with the powdered form, which costs the same, but makes two
gallons. PowerBars run about $1.59, which works out to 70.17 cents
per ounce, compared to 26.9 cents per ounce for a Nature Valley
Crunchy Granola Bar, a fairly high-end snack.

HEIRLOOM TOMATOES: EVERYBODY'S TASTE OF SUMMER
</HEADLINE>
  Includes color photo of a selection of red and orange heirloom
tomatoes. 
 By KAREN BAAR 
 c.1999 Karen Baar 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Baylor Lowes was surprised when he confronted the tomato cart at
Bix Restaurant in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ''The waiter brought out a large stainless cart, the way they
used to serve prime rib,'' Lowes explains. ''There was an exotic
mixture of heirloom tomatoes _ red, variegated, yellow, green and
purple _ which he went on to describe as he prepared and dressed
the salad. It was quite entertaining.''
</P>
<P>
   But you don't have to eat in a tony restaurant to sample
heirloom tomatoes. Home gardeners have been growing them for years,
and they're now appearing frequently at farmers markets, too.
</P>
<P>
   What's driving this trend is flavor so exquisite, it's hard to
believe these odd-shaped, colorful vegetables bear any relation at
all to those sold at the supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   An heirloom vegetable is open pollinated, meaning it will breed
true and consistently from seed, even though its parentage may be
complex.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's the literal definition,'' says Lawrence
Davis-Hollander, director of the Eastern Native Seed Conservancy.
''But we also say that heirlooms are varieties that are 50 years
old or older and have been handed down for a couple of generations
or more.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis-Hollander estimates 5,000 to 7,000 tomatoes meet this
definition. Many of their names such as Cherokee Purple or Aunt
Lucy's Italian Plum, describe their heritage, while Czech Yellow,
Biely Naliv, and countless others evoke immigrants' tales.
</P>
<P>
   The tomato seeds that came to this country in the bags of
European immigrants certainly had a circuitous journey. Wild
tomatoes originated in South America. They were first domesticated
and cultivated by pre-Columbian Indians in what is Mexico today; in
fact, the name ''tomato'' comes from the Nahuatl word tomatl.
</P>
<P>
   Explorers brought tomatoes from the Americas to Europe in the
early 1500s. A member of the sometimes deadly nightshade family,
the tomato was feared as a poisonous fruit in some places.
</P>
<P>
   But by the mid-17th century they were being consumed in Spain,
and by the 18th century they had become a part of Italian cuisine.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the tomato remained an object of suspicion for the
English and, by extension, the American colonists, until the 1830s.
</P>
<P>
   Since then there has been a total about-face.
</P>
<P>
   ''No American kitchen garden is complete without its tomatoes,''
says William Woys Weaver, author of ''Heirloom vegetable
Gardening.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It is probably safe to say that Americans judge vegetable
gardens today by the tomatoes in them, rather than by the cabbages
or carrots or other vegetables,'' Weaver adds.
</P>
<P>
   But heirloom varieties are not standard fare at supermarkets,
because they don't fit into what Joel Patraker, assistant director
of Greenmarket, a farmers market in New York City, calls the
food-mile scenario.
</P>
<P>
   On average, he says, the food we eat travels 3,000 miles to get
to our plates. Tomatoes sold at the supermarket, therefore, must
have a long shelf life and be able to withstand being packed in
cartons of 25 pounds or more.
</P>
<P>
   And let's not forget the profit motive. Large farms in this
country tend toward monoculture; that is, they grow one big crop.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, because heirloom tomato plants are less productive
and tend to be more susceptible to disease than modern hybrids,
they are even less attractive to large growers.
</P>
<P>
   But these issues aren't as important to home gardeners, who
select vegetables based on taste, a quality heirlooms have in
spades.
</P>
<P>
   Davis-Hollander compares heirloom tomatoes to wine: ''They might
even be more complex than wine. Every tomato tastes different,
especially when grown in different soil in different years. It's
about locality and regionality.''
</P>
<P>
   Divine taste is not the only reason for buying heirloom
tomatoes. Buying these gems means buying locally, thereby helping
to preserve the dwindling number of small farms in this country.
</P>
<P>
   At least for the foreseeable future, you'll find heirlooms only
by planting your own or buying from local farmers. But things are
changing, thanks to the growing sophistication of American
consumers, who, once they've tasted how wonderful these tomatoes
can be, keep coming back for more.
</P>
<P>
   Someday, we may even see them in the supermarket, following in
the path of other gourmet foods.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you asked a farmer ten years ago if he thought he'd see his
mesclun in Stop &AMP; Shop, he'd have said no,'' says Davis-Hollander.
''I think eventually more heirlooms will get into the supermarket.
It will remain somewhat of a niche market, but there will be a
bigger niche.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, why not try growing them? It's easy to get started.
Driven by an eager market, more and more seed companies, including
mainstream catalogs, are offering seeds for heirlooms.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe your aunt Tillie or a friend will give you some seeds.
Then you can become a link in the chain of gardeners who are
preserving this precious and delicious-heritage.
</P>
<P>
   Heirloom Index
</P>
<P>
   There are thousands of heirloom tomato varieties, so you can
experiment in your garden indefinitely until you find your
favorites. Before planting, however, consider how you're most
likely to use them _ sliced in salads, cooked in pasta sauces,
dried, or just eaten whole _ and choose the varieties best suited
for that purpose. SLICING TOMATOES
</P>
<P>
   A good slicing tomato is meaty, with a fruity, complex taste and
a pleasing balance of sugar and acid that can stand up to a
vinaigrette. Here are some examples:
</P>
<P>
   Brandywine. Probably the most famous of all American heirlooms,
large and lobed in pink or yellow.
</P>
<P>
   Oxheart. Sometimes called strawberry tomato because of its
shape, large and reddish orange. White Wonder On the small side,
cream-colored or yellowish white.
</P>
<P>
   Pineapple. Described as ''a big ugly sucker but incredibly
tasty,'' large and yellow, with pink stripes or marbling.
</P>
<P>
   Pruden's Purple. Large and meaty, pale pink to purple. PASTE
TOMATOES
</P>
<P>
   When making tomato paste or sauce, look for varieties with more
pulp and less water, as well as a sweet, rich taste.
</P>
<P>
   Grandma Mary Red. Good size, high proportion of meat to juice.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Patti's Italian Paste. Red heart-shaped fruit, good
production.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbertie. Slightly square, five inches long, flavorful, and
meaty. TOMATOES FOR DRYING
</P>
<P>
   Even more so than paste tomatoes, good drying tomatoes should
have a deep ''tomatoey'' flavor and a low juice content.
</P>
<P>
   Principe Borghese. Small, red, and plum-shaped.
</P>
<P>
   Black Plum. Brownish red to mahogany in color, plum-shaped,
about one and a half inches long. CHERRY AND OTHER SMALL TOMATOES
</P>
<P>
   Because it's so simple just to pop these into your mouth, look
for a juicy, mild, sweet flavor. They shouldn't be overly sugary;
it's good to have some tartness.
</P>
<P>
   Yellow Pear. Small, pear-shaped, mild, and sweet.
</P>
<P>
   Red Pear. A bit larger than the yellow pear and more
full-flavored.
</P>
<P>
   Red Currant. Tiny fruit in clusters, with intense flavor. &QL;

`THE FIRST WORLD WAR': TOOLS FOR DESTRUCTION, BUT NONE FOR TURNING
BACK 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eight decades after the close of World War I, its formative
impact on this bloody century remains all too clear. As the eminent
military historian John Keegan points out in his latest book, the
First World War not only swept away the great empires of Central
and Eastern Europe and left 10 million dead, but also left ``a
legacy of political rancor and racial hatred so intense that no
explanation of the causes of the Second World War can stand without
reference to those roots.''
</P>
<P>
   The war opened the way to totalitarianism, ``a new word for a
system that rejected the liberalism and constitutionalism which had
inspired European politics since the eclipse of monarchy in 1789.''
And the chaos left in the war's wake fertilized deadly impulses
that persist, as the current crisis in Kosovo attests, to this day:
from the massacre of ethnic minorities to ``the extinction of small
national sovereignties, the destruction of parliaments and the
elevation of commissars, gauleiters and warlords to power over
voiceless millions.''
</P>
<P>
   With ``The First World War,'' Keegan has written a kind of
companion volume to his 1989 book ``The Second World War.'' Once
again, he uses his military expertise to analyze strategic and
operational developments and put them into historical perspective.
And once again, he uses his narrative abilities, honed in a dozen
books (including such classic works as ``The Face of Battle'' and
``The Mask of Command''), to bring to life such famous engagements
as Gallipoli, Verdun and Passchendaele.
</P>
<P>
   Keegan's book is at once more analytic and less encyclopedic
than Martin Gilbert's 1994 book ``The First World War: A Complete
History.'' Although Keegan does an eloquent job of evoking the mood
on the battlefield and the appalling loss of life suffered during
operations like the Somme, his account relies less on the
testimonies of individual soldiers than Gilbert's. Instead, his
narrative is animated by sharply stated assessments of long-term
strategies and short-term tactics, political goals and military
means.
</P>
<P>
   He blames the German Kaiser's ``strategically unnecessary
attempt to match Britain's maritime strength'' in the years before
1914 for contributing to the ``fatal hostility between the two
countries'' and for galvanizing ``the neurotic climate of suspicion
and insecurity from which the First World War was born.'' He
contends that the Germans' ``failure to match the Allies in tank
development must be judged one of their worst military
miscalculations of the war.'' And he argues that the British
general Douglas Haig's ``profligacy with men'' prolonged the agony
on the western front: ``On the Somme he had sent the flower of
British youth to death or mutilation,'' Keegan writes; ``at
Passchendaele he had tipped the survivors into the slough of
despond.''
</P>
<P>
   On the much debated question of the generalship of World War I,
Keegan is of two minds. He concedes that the opulent life style of
many generals _ ``the well-polished entourage, the glittering motor
cars, the cavalry escorts, the regular routine, the heavy dinners,
the uninterrupted hours of sleep'' _ stood in harsh contrast to the
``cold rations, wet boots, sodden uniforms, flooded trenches'' that
their subordinates had to endure. He also argues, however, that
most of the accusations of ``incompetence and incomprehension''
made against these generals were probably misplaced.
</P>
<P>
   With ``battle-altering resources'' like reliable armored,
cross-country vehicles and portable two-way radios a tantalizing
few years out of reach, Keegan writes, ``the generals were trapped
within the iron fetters of a technology all too adequate for mass
destruction of life but quite inadequate to restore to them the
flexibilities of control that would have kept destruction of life
within bearable limits.''
</P>
<P>
   As Keegan sees it, World War I was both tragic and unnecessary _
``unnecessary because the train of events that led to its outbreak
might have been broken at any point during the five weeks of crisis
that preceded the first clash of arms, had prudence or common good
will found a voice.'' Like many historians before him, he
acknowledges the role that interlinking alliances and abstract
military strategies played in setting off the conflagration, and he
adds that ``the existence of a permanent medium of negotiation
between the European powers'' _ like regular summit conferences, or
a ``hot line'' between government leaders _ might have robbed such
war plans of ``their menacing instantaneity.''
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks between the slaying of the Hapsburg heir, Archduke
Franz Ferdinand, by Serbian-backed assassins on June 28, 1914, and
the outbreak of fighting in August, he suggests, ``events
successively and progressively overwhelmed the capacity of
statesmen and diplomats to control and contain them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Honorable and able men though they were,'' he writes, ``the
servants of the chancelleries and foreign officers of the great
powers in the July crisis were bound to the wheel of the written
note, the encipherment routine, the telegraph schedule. The
potentialities of the telephone, which might have cut across the
barriers to communication, seem to have eluded their imaginative
powers. The potentialities of radio, available but unused, evaded
them altogether.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout this volume, Keegan captures the anomalous, even
surreal quality of the war. He describes the persistence of archaic
uniforms (frogged jackets and scarlet trousers for France's light
cavalry; similarly antiquated outfits adorned in 10 shades of red
for the Austrians) and ancient methods of communication (signal
flags on the high seas; runners and carrier pigeons on land),
alongside such technological innovations as the submarine, the
airplane and the tank.
</P>
<P>
   He shows how cruelly the combatants' original expectations for a
quick, short war were betrayed. And he meticulously traces the
terrible escalation of a local crisis (Austria's determination to
punish Serbia for the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand) into a
world war, a war that claimed the lives of 1 million British, 1.7
million French, 1.5 million of the Hapsburg Empire, 2 million
Germans and 1.7 million Russians. It was a war that would transform
``a prosperous continent at the height of its success as a source
and agent of global wealth and power and at one of the peaks of its
intellectual and cultural achievement'' into what the English poet
Siegfried Sassoon called ``death's gray land.''

FILM ON GAYS GETS MIXED REVIEW FROM PBS AFFILIATES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CAROL NESS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ If the point of showing the groundbreaking
documentary ``It's Elementary'' on television is to stimulate a
public dialogue on teaching children about tolerance of
homosexuality _ well, it's halfway there and the video's only just
hitting the airwaves.
</P>
<P>
   Because of a full-tilt crusade by the Christian right to keep it
off public television, the buzz is up about the broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   Stations in 23 of the top 30 markets have scheduled the
critically acclaimed San Francisco-made documentary, starting with
WNET in New York last week and stretching through September. Five
others have said they will air it; Dallas and Cleveland are the two
biggest stations to decline.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, 89 public stations of 347 across the country have
scheduled it, 17 more are on board but haven't set a date, and 53
are still considering it.
</P>
<P>
   KQED of San Francisco is sponsoring the broadcast after the
Public Broadcasting System, ever skittish about scaring off its
congressional sponsors with controversial programming, turned it
down for national distribution without saying why.
</P>
<P>
   The hope of KQED and the film producers is that the broadcasts
will encourage people to go beyond what they think they know about
the subject and get them talking to each other about their
legitimate, highly charged differences.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a huge cultural turning point,'' said Debra
Chasnoff, who directed and (with Helen Cohen) co-produced the
77-minute video, cut to just under an hour for TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's really significant. When we started working on
this film in the early '90s, people said America is not ready to
talk about this at all,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ready or not, since the debut in 1996, people have found it
harder and harder to avoid the issue of educating children about
the existence of gays and lesbians and about tolerance.
</P>
<P>
   Chiefly aimed at adults, the film is in use now by about 3,000
schools, plus 500 colleges of education, mostly to help teachers,
Chasnoff said.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years, gay students and their parents have
successfully sued schools for failing to protect them from vicious
harassment. Gay and lesbian teen-agers have been coming out of the
closet and, with their parents, forcing schools to deal with their
presence. Gay and lesbian parents, like Chasnoff, have stepped up
efforts to ensure their own young children aren't ostracized in
class.
</P>
<P>
   When Chasnoff started the film, her eldest son, now 10, was
entering kindergarten in a San Francisco public school.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thought his family _ two moms _ was the greatest thing on
Earth,'' Chasnoff said. ``I was really concerned about what kind of
information he would start to get from other kids or from the lack
of discussion of lesbians and gay people in the elementary school
curriculum.''
</P>
<P>
   Her concerns were confirmed in one hair-raising moment, when she
and her partner spoke to his second-grade class.
</P>
<P>
   ``We walked in. One little boy looked at me and said, `Are you a
lesbian?' Then he screamed and ran to the other side of the room,''
Chasnoff said. ``Where do they get the idea, by second grade, that
a classmate's mom is a potential object of disgust?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Elementary'' takes viewers into six classrooms, where it
becomes clear that even the youngest have heard about gay people
and have absorbed negative attitudes about them.
</P>
<P>
   In one New York City classroom, children volunteer dozens of
words they associate with ``gay,'' including ``love,'' ``pervert''
and ``sick.''
</P>
<P>
   The message of the video is that homophobia gets ingrained early
and hurts people, and that schools are one place to teach
tolerance.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of our goals was to open up the public dialogue on the
issue when nobody was talking about it. Should the schools be doing
this or not? It was just assumed that of course they don't talk
about it in schools,'' Chasnoff said.
</P>
<P>
   Several conservative Christian groups are trying to keep the
show off the air. The organizations include the American Family
Association, the Florida-based Coral Ridge Ministries, and the
Concerned Women for America.
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco, KQED is taking special care with its own
presentation later this month to include views outside of the
film's, wrapping it into a two-hour program that includes an
in-studio debate and viewer call-ins.
</P>
<P>
   About a dozen people who haven't seen the film are being
invited, most of them parents representing the full range of
attitudes about homosexuality, said Mary Bitterman, president and
chief executive of KQED.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not looking for people who would just polarize the
discussion because their minds are completely set,'' Bitterman
said. Instead of representatives of the groups crusading against
the film, the station sought ``people in our community who may be
supportive of what those organizations do.''

UNION, PORT LEADERS HUNKER DOWN FOR CONTRACT TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GEORGE RAINE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ This year, cargo valued at more than $300
billion will move in and out of ports in Oakland, Long Beach, Los
Angeles and elsewhere along the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   It is lumber and grain bound for Asian markets, and Barbie dolls
destined for American girls, and there's every reason to believe
the future for trade is bright.
</P>
<P>
   That is why labor leaders and economists _ as well as
manufacturers, retailers, shippers and others around the world
whose fortunes are tied to open seas and efficient ports _ shudder
at the thought of trouble on the docks.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators in mid-May began work on a new three-year contract
that would replace the agreement expiring July 1 and bind 10,000
West Coast members of the International Longshore and Warehouse
Union (ILWU) to 90 U.S. and foreign shipping operators.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone involved in the negotiations, which are taking place in
San Francisco, took an oath of silence until they have a product.
Both sides, however, have said they expect a satisfactory result,
considering that the pressure to maintain the flow of trade is
extraordinary.
</P>
<P>
   Despite those assurances, there is a history of tension in the
longshoremen-shippers relationship, and several volleys of tough
talk were fired by both sides earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   The stage was set for negotiations that Joseph Miniace, the
president and chief executive of the San Francisco-based Pacific
Maritime Association, representing shippers and terminal operators
in contract talks, called the most important in PMA's 50-year
history.
</P>
<P>
   Art Pulaski, executive secretary and treasurer of the California
Labor Federation, which coordinates legislative and political
action on behalf of 2.1 million union members, said of California
ports: ``These are the ports of entry of California's prosperity
and growth. The contract affects not simply 10,000 jobs, but
hundreds of thousands of jobs that depend on California trade.''
</P>
<P>
   Although there is now no public airing of details under
discussion, Miniace said in a recent letter to PMA members that
increasing economic pressures have ``highlighted concerns about
stagnating and declining productivity at West Coast marine cargo
terminals.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``Terminal operators have not enjoyed the return on
investments through productivity increases that other industry
sectors have experienced. The productivity issues will not go away,
and its improvement will remain a high priority.''
</P>
<P>
   Productivity is likewise a mantra for the ILWU, said its San
Francisco-based president, Brian McWilliams. ``Every quarter it's
the same old thing _ productivity is down and the West Coast is
going to lose business because of its high labor costs and, of
course, the unreliability of the work force,'' he said in a
pre-contract negotiations letter to members. ``And yet for all
PMA's predictions of industry disaster, every quarter we are
breaking records for the most containers moved through our ports.''
</P>
<P>
   In the talks, productivity is a word with many meanings, but
fundamentally it means efficiently moving cargo about so that it
can get to market quickly. It also means the use of technological
enhancements that threaten some traditional union jobs, and these
are the issues on the table, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, record-keeping and planning for how a vessel is
loaded and unloaded _ for years done on paper on the docks _ can
now be done by computer from anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was our work, our jurisdiction, and they're trying to
take some of that work away,'' said a source familiar with the 104
issues that the ILWU negotiating team took into the talks. ``They
want to send that off to a right-to-work state like Utah and pay
somebody eight dollars an hour to key it into a computer.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray Boyle, the director of the Maritime Division of the Port of
Oakland, the fourth largest port in the nation, believes both sides
can benefit by enhancing productivity.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about how we can move forward and make our operations
more productive, take advantage of the automation, the innovation,
that's around and available, and still have a viable, productive
work force,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the ILWU wants better benefits packages and pension
and wage increases, according to a source close to the talks.
</P>
<P>
   ILWU members are relatively handsomely compensated. The standard
hourly wage is $25.68, but that does not include overtime or
bonuses paid those with certain skills, which fatten checks.
</P>
<P>
   According to PMA research, the average fully registered ILWU
longshore workers paid for at least 2,000 hours last year earned
$99,016, while clerks and foremen _ ``walking bosses'' _ earned up
to $117,617 and $156,251, respectively.

RESEARCHERS SHATTER THE MYTH OF THE BRAVE MEERKAT SENTRY 
</HEADLINE>
  (The Science Times) 
(HLW) 
 By CAROL KAESUK YOON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   While his compatriots scuffle about in the sand for delicious
scorpions or fat, tasty mice, one meerkat stands alone, bolt
upright on an exposed perch, scanning for hawks with dark eyes
wide, ready to call out at the first sign of danger. Like other
such guards in the animal kingdom, these endearingly vulnerable
meerkat sentinels have long impressed biologists as true altruists
_ creatures willing to forgo food and to brave danger to protect
others.
</P>
<P>
   Now a study in the current Science suggests that these beasts
may not be such adorable heroes after all. Researchers have
discovered that meerkats abandon their hunting to act as guards
only when their bellies are good and full. And they appear to do
so, not as an act of noble daring, but because by being the first
to see a predator, they can be sure of being the first down a hole
and out of harm's way. Standing guard, researchers concluded, may
be the safest thing to do once a meerkat has had enough to eat.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers say the discovery that sentinel behavior can arise
from the most selfish of motives suggests that other apparently
self-sacrificing acts could well turn out to be self-serving upon
closer scrutiny. In addition, the researchers say, the new study _
which exactly fulfills a set of predictions for the behavior of a
selfish sentinel _ may explain why some animals fight for the
position.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be that quite a lot of sentinels are selfish,'' said
Dr. Tim Clutton-Brock, a behavioral ecologist at Cambridge
University in England, who observed meerkats for thousands of hours
with more than 30 colleagues over five years.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kevin J. McGowan, a behavioral ecologist at Cornell
University in New York state who has studied sentinel behavior in
birds, said that biologists had assumed such behaviors were
altruistic, often with little evidence. ``There are a lot of things
that people know for a fact that simply aren't so,'' he said.
Calling the study important, he said of the meerkats: ``Each one of
these guys is doing his own selfish best.''
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to see why the researchers figured the sentinel post
risky when they first started studying meerkats in the Kalahari
Desert in southern Africa. Skittish to begin with, meerkats,
peering nervously from an exposed perch waiting for a hawk to soar
in, do seem at risk of being eaten and appear particularly daring.
In addition, while the other protected meerkats are at their
leisure to dig away for food, heads stuck in the sand, rear ends
very much exposed, the poor sentinel seems forced to fast.
</P>
<P>
   So Clutton-Brock said he and colleagues at first accepted the
standard altruistic explanation. According to a theory known as
kin-selection, altruists get their genes passed on by helping
relatives who share their genes to survive and reproduce, just as
they could by producing their own offspring.
</P>
<P>
   But researchers found that while meerkats live in family groups,
unrelated animals that join the group often act as sentinels.
Meerkats even act as sentinels when they are alone and no one needs
protection. Looking closer, the researchers found that these
supposedly daring sentinels always positioned themselves near a
hole where they could dive for cover. And never in more than 2,000
hours of observations was a sentinel attacked or killed. Meanwhile,
Clutton-Brock said, other meerkats were hauled away by predators.
</P>
<P>
   And, while the researchers had thought these sentinels rotated
shifts, they found instead that who was on duty depended largely on
who had last eaten the most. Simply by providing a meerkat with a
hearty meal of a hard-boiled egg, the researchers could speed the
return of that animal to a sentinel post.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a beautiful set of data that fulfill my predictions and
then some,'' said Dr. Peter Bednekoff, behavioral ecologist at
Eastern Michigan University in Ypsilanti, who first suggested the
notion of selfish sentinels. He said other examples were likely to
be identified soon.
</P>
<P>
   But not all the animal kingdom sentinels, a group that includes
monkeys, scrub jays and antelopes, have it as easy as meerkats.
</P>
<P>
   At least in some species, sentinel behavior is indeed deadly and
self-sacrificial. In the dwarf mongoose, males low in the hierarchy
make up a rear guard. Keeping watch from behind as the group hunts
for food, these sentinels are often killed as they run to catch up
with their escaping companions. And some sentinels take these risks
to benefit their close relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Even the adorable meerkat may yet redeem itself as a bit of an
altruist. Although being a sentinel may itself not entail great
risk, it is hard to imagine a selfish reason for their giving a
shout of warning before dashing for cover.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real question is why do they give an alarm call?'' said
Dr. Paul W. Sherman, animal behaviorist at Cornell. Describing the
study as fascinating, he added: ``The call tells us there's
something more than selfishness involved.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, meerkats have reason to be altruists. Although
unrelated animals live in meerkat groups, most are close relatives,
individuals whose evolutionary fates are closely linked.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman noted that such mixtures of selfishness and altruism
should not be surprising. In research with ground squirrels, he
found both self-sacrificing and selfish alarm calls. Female ground
squirrels give an altruistic alarm call that endangers the caller
while effectively alerting the young nearby. But there is also a
selfish alarm call that squirrels give, not to protect others, but
to protect themselves. When callers make the selfish whistle, a
pandemonium of running, whistling squirrels ensues in which the
original caller can hide.

ACTOR PLAYS SECOND FIDDLE IN INDIE FILM 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARLA MATZER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Does Samuel L. Jackson want to be Morgan Freeman?
</P>
<P>
   He's certainly not giving up the action and suspense genres for
art films. The 50-year-old Jackson is wrapping up work on the
military courtroom drama ``Rules of Engagement'' with Tommy Lee
Jones, and he plans to star next in an update of ``Shaft,''
directed by John Singleton. In July, Jackson will star in the
``Deep Blue Sea,'' a scientists-vs.-killer-shark epic.
</P>
<P>
   But when he heard that Freeman had bowed out of the independent
film ``The Red Violin'' because of a scheduling conflict, Jackson
stepped forward to claim the small but important role of violin
expert Charles Morritz for himself. He'd read the script, which he
found ``very moving,'' and saw the role of Morritz as an
opportunity to keep changing as an actor.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, ``Violin'' director Francois Girard
recalled, ``When I met with Sam, I wasn't sure if he knew that
(Freeman) had been up for the role first, so I was kind of dancing
around that fact. Then Sam said, `I want you to know I'd be honored
to be your next choice after Morgan Freeman.' To me, that was very
elegant.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said that he figured if it was good enough for Freeman,
it was good enough for him. ``If you think of me in the same
sentence that you think of Morgan Freeman, I figure ... hey, I'll
do it,'' said Jackson, with obvious admiration for his fellow
actor.
</P>
<P>
   In the movie, being released Friday by Lions Gate Films (which
released the critically acclaimed ``Gods and Monsters'' last year),
Jackson plays a top violin appraiser who discovers a shocking
secret about the priceless red violin of the title. The film is
unusual in many respects. The story of the almost humanlike
instrument is told in a series of flashbacks over the course of
four centuries, with Jackson's character appearing on screen for
less than 20 brief, but pivotal, minutes.
</P>
<P>
   After the secret of the violin is revealed, it is Morritz who
realizes the violin may be too valuable to be simply auctioned off
to the highest bidder. He is forced to make a life-changing
decision about the instrument.
</P>
<P>
   Over the centuries, the violin is, by turns, the unborn child of
the violin maker, the mother of a young orphan prodigy and the
lover of a flamboyant virtuoso. The story, which takes the audience
from Europe to China to North America, is a far cry from the
underworld inhabited by some of Jackson's most memorable
characters.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, at 50 _ albeit a hip, youthful 50 _ seems to be making
sure he will still be getting challenging roles at 60. The
62-year-old Freeman's career isn't a bad model to emulate. Like
Freeman, Jackson only came into his own as a film actor later in
life. Now, when directors want a dignified actor who exudes moral
authority, they call Freeman.
</P>
<P>
   While Jackson started in theater and has played a range of
roles, he has become known on film for low-life characters like
crack addict Gator in ``Jungle Fever'' and hit man Jules Winfield
in ``Pulp Fiction.'' He admits those roles weigh a little heavily
at times.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I got paid for each reference I've had to Jules (from
fans), I'd be terrifically rich,'' said Jackson with a weary smile.
``At least three times a week, someone comes up and asks me, `Hey,
you know what they call a Quarter Pounder with Cheese in France?'
And I say, `No _ what?''' Jackson said, feigning wide-eyed
ignorance at the line from ``Pulp Fiction.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' he added with a shrug, ``it doesn't really bother me.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Jackson seems to take it all in stride. Describing the
violin of the movie's title, he says, ``It's been through cultural
differences, it's been through social change, it's been in
jeopardy.'' The same could be said of Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   After growing up in Tennessee and becoming a student activist at
Morehouse College, Jackson made a name for himself on the New York
stage. Later he fought and won a battle with substance abuse. In
his career, his persistence in going after roles that weren't
necessarily written for a black actor finally paid off. His intense
portrayal of Gator in 1991's ``Jungle Fever'' cemented his fame.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he's enjoying his success _ but also appears to be staying
very grounded, even as he takes roles in such blockbusters as
``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom Menace.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I always like to see my movies in a theater, with an
audience,'' Jackson says. ``I consciously plan to do things that
make sense to an audience, so I like to see if I made the right
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   But what about the common claim among actors that they don't
like to watch themselves on screen? ``Come on,'' Jackson says
dismissively. ``If you don't like watching yourself, do theater. Or
get another job.''
</P>
<P>
   Girard, whose quirky credits include ``Thirty Two Short Films by
Glenn Gould,'' admires Jackson's emotional honesty and his striving
to keep growing as an actor. ``We live in a system that tends to
keep us where we've been successful,'' said Girard, a slightly
built 36-year-old with the rather wild-eyed look of an artist.
``It's the same thing for directors: We keep getting offered the
same type of projects ... It's the responsibility of the artist to
escape that.''
</P>
<P>
   To aid in Jackson's preparation for the role, Girard sent him
stacks of information about violins and their appraisal. Jackson
learned from a top appraiser who served as a consultant on the film
how to handle and examine a violin like an expert.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson recalls there was even a bit of real-life drama
involving the violin during the filming _ somewhat mirroring the
emotional backdrop against which the violin's story is told.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the violins I handle in the movie is actually a $5
million Stradivarius,'' said Jackson. ``The producer got someone to
lend it to us ... and he carried it to Montreal and left it with
this other assessor, who has a vault in his house there.''
</P>
<P>
   Continued Jackson, ``The day before we were supposed to use the
violin, the assessor's wife discovered he was having an affair, and
locked him out of the house. They had to get the police to go to
his house so they could get the violin.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson flashes one of his mischievous, toothy grins. The actor
knows that wherever a film is set _ and whether the characters are
made of flesh and blood or wood _ passion is universal. It's his
talent at ``showing that on the outside,'' as he puts it, that he
counts on to keep him on top in the fickle world of Hollywood.  &QL;

EXPERTS ASK WHY SO FEW TAKE DRUGS FOR MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS 
</HEADLINE>
  (The Science Times) 
(mk) 
 By DENISE GRADY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Four months ago, Valerie Millerick finally made a decision that
she had been putting off for years: She began taking weekly
injections of a drug called Avonex, to treat multiple sclerosis.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Millerick, who is 54, had been living with the illness for
about two decades, and for most of that time she did not think she
was sick enough to need regular treatment.
</P>
<P>
   But multiple sclerosis can be insidious. It often takes a course
of remissions and relapses, and recent studies have shown that even
during remissions, the disease may be silently eating away at the
nervous system. It destroys myelin, the protective sheath around
nerve fibers in the brain and spinal cord, and gradually begins to
damage the nerves themselves. Although it is not commonly fatal, it
can cause permanent weakness, paralysis, loss of eyesight and
memory and slowing of thought processes.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly last year, Ms. Millerick felt herself losing ground to
repeated attacks of intense fatigue and weakness. But she works
full time as head of a nursing agency that she founded in Valley
Cottage, N.Y., and she would not give in to the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was battering me,'' she said. ``Every time you have an
attack, it leaves you with a little bit of residual damage.'' Her
right hand and leg were weakened permanently, and to walk any
distance she needed a cane.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw myself in a wheelchair, and that's not where I want to
be,'' she said. ``I had to do something to stop it.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no cure for multiple sclerosis, but Avonex and two
other drugs, Betaseron and Copaxone, can keep it from getting
worse. For most patients, each drug produces a 30 percent reduction
in the frequency of flareups and the progression of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Since she began taking Avonex, Ms. Millerick has not had another
attack. ``I think I made a wise choice,'' she said, ``but I wish I
had made it a few years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though scientists have hailed the drugs as a breakthrough,
patients have been slow to take them. Last fall, the Multiple
Sclerosis Society reported that only 18 percent of the people who
could benefit from the drugs were using them.
</P>
<P>
   That is something that the National Multiple Sclerosis Society
is trying to change. It may be human nature to deny the severity of
an illness and to put off taking medicine and leave well enough
alone. But experts have come to believe that multiple sclerosis
patients who do so may suffer irreversible losses that medication
might have prevented or at least delayed.
</P>
<P>
   Betaseron has been available in this country since 1993, and
Avonex since 1996. Both are forms of beta interferon, an artificial
version of a natural substance made by the immune system. Copaxone,
which also acts on the immune system, was approved in this country
in 1997. The three drugs are the first ones ever proven to slow the
underlying course of multiple sclerosis, which is thought to be the
result of a malfunctioning immune system that turns against the
patient's own tissues.
</P>
<P>
   In November, the society formally recommended that every patient
with the relapsing form of the disease _ the most common type,
affecting 70 percent of the 300,000 to 350,000 patients in the
nation _ should start taking one of the three drugs as soon as the
condition is diagnosed.
</P>
<P>
   But doctors also acknowledge that the treatments can be
difficult. The drugs cost $1,000 a month and must be given by
injection _ daily, every other day or once a week, depending on the
drug. The course of treatment is indefinite, probably lifelong. The
interferons can cause flulike fever, chills and aches, and pain and
swelling at the injection site. For all that trouble, the drugs do
not cure the disease and may not make people feel better.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have to take these treatments on faith,'' said Dr.
Stanley van den Noort, chief medical officer of the National
Multiple Sclerosis Society and a professor of neurology at the
University of California at Irvine. ``For a year or two, the drugs
don't make them feel better. But I've had patients on Betaseron for
five or six years, and you couldn't get them off with pliers. They
love it.''
</P>
<P>
   Van den Noort said doctors, patients and insurance companies all
contributed to the low use of the drugs. ``A lot of doctors are
reluctant to use these drugs because of side effects,'' he said.
``They tell patients, `You're too mild, you don't need this.'''
</P>
<P>
   That is what many patients want to hear. And, he added, insurers
and health maintenance organizations do not promote treatment,
either, because they would rather not pay for it. Part of the
reason the society issued its recommendations was to make it clear
to insurers that patients need the drugs, van den Noort said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Both doctors and patients have to get used to the idea of using
a medicine that, at best, will maintain the status quo, rather than
improve it. Mimi Mosher, a 37-year-old graphic designer in
Mechanicsville, Va., who has taken both Betaseron and Avonex, said
that limited goal can be hard to accept.
</P>
<P>
   ``Initially, I had a misconception,'' Ms. Mosher said. ``I
thought I had pretty well educated myself and yet I still felt,
`I'm not getting any better from this. Why am I taking it?' I was
expecting some radical event. What's carved in your mind is that
medicine is supposed to make you better, even though I was fully
aware that's not how interferon works. It's a slow-you-down,
maintenance kind of drug.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mosher said that after taking Betaseron for two years, she
became skeptical about it and stopped for about eight months. ``I
had more fatigue, and my endurance dropped,'' she said. ``I was too
tired even to speak, or to listen to my son.''
</P>
<P>
   But when she went back on medication (she switched to Avonex),
she regained her energy. ``I feel that I have basically leveled off
with the disease,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Other patients remain wary and skeptical of new drugs, sometimes
because of bad experiences. One, a lawyer who did not want her name
printed, said drugs she was given years ago for eye problems from
multiple sclerosis were later found to cause the very problem they
were supposed to treat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's science like this that makes me cynical,'' she said.
``They know something now, but what will they think in 20 years?''
</P>
<P>
   She prefers to treat herself with acupuncture, vitamins and
other supplements and a vegetarian diet that meets the low-fat
regimen that is recommended for all patients with multiple
sclerosis. But she will also enter a study of Estriol, a hormone
produced by pregnant women. It is experimental, but she was
encouraged by what she read about results in animal tests, and the
natural aspect of it appealed to her.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a gut feeling, I guess,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn Wilmott, who has multiple sclerosis and runs support groups
for the Southern California chapter of the national society, also
had bad experiences with treatments, including severe side effects
from both Betaseron and Copaxone. But about a year ago she decided
to try Avonex anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm loving it,'' she said. ``My memory is much better. I can
handle more than one project at a time without major confusion. ''
</P>
<P>
   Before taking the drug, Ms. Wilmott had lost some of her
eyesight and her ability to walk, and she does not expect to regain
them. But she hopes to hold her ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be proactive,'' she said. ``You can try one drug,
and if it doesn't work, try another. This disease causes definite,
permanent nerve damage and brain atrophy. Stop it while you can.''

COMPUTER NAVIGATES NASAL PASSAGES DURING SURGERY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PHIL DAVIS  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Imagine breathing with marbles shoved up both
nostrils.
</P>
<P>
   That's how Thomas Fox, a 41-year-old engineer from Corona, felt
for most of his life _ thanks to severely blocked sinuses that
began developing when he was only 13. Prescription drugs couldn't
shrink the swollen tissue and nasal polyps, a benign form of tumor,
that clogged his sinus passages.
</P>
<P>
   And the only thing a corrective surgery at age 15 gave him was
scar tissue that made the blockage worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's painful,'' Fox said. ``For more than 25 years, I probably
haven't been able to pull any air through my nose. It got to the
point I couldn't taste or smell my food and I was lucky if I got
three or four hours of sleep a night.''
</P>
<P>
   On May 28, Fox finally lost those marbles.
</P>
<P>
   That morning, surgeon Marc Kerner guided a thin instrument
called a microdebrider up Fox's nose and suctioned away 28 years of
blockage.
</P>
<P>
   What makes his surgery stand out among the roughly half a
million other sinus operations performed each year in the United
States is the equipment: a new computer system called InstaTrak,
the first of several new devices designed to make sinus surgery
safer.
</P>
<P>
   The InstaTrak computer provides the surgeon with an
unprecedented, personalized road map to a patient's sinuses and
real-time tracking of the surgical tool _ vital information
considering the honeycomb of sinuses in the skull are separated by
mere fractions of an inch from the eyes and brain.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how it works: A computer scan of the patient's sinuses _
called a Computed Tomography (CT) scan _ is downloaded into the
InstaTrak computer, which displays the images on a monitor in the
operating room. A plastic headset _ worn by the patient during the
scan and the surgery _ provides a frame of reference for the
computer to track the microdebrider, which has a tiny
electromagnetic homing transmitter on its tip.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor follows the instrument's progress by watching a set
of crosshairs moving across the CT scan. An endoscope, a small
4-millimeter-diameter telescope, provides a live, close-up view of
the progress of the surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see exactly where you are,'' said Kerner, the surgeon
who brought the equipment to the San Fernando Valley and is
training other surgeons to use it. ``Sinus surgery can be very
dangerous. It basically used to be done blind. You'd go in there
and kind of pluck around and hope you're OK. This has allowed us
more precision. There's less guesswork involved, and I can go right
for the specific area that's blocked.''
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, the surgery requires no incisions and the patient
can go home after only a few hours. Without the computer, surgeons
enter hard-to-reach spots in the sinuses through an incision
between the eye and the nose.
</P>
<P>
   InstaTrak surgery costs under $2,000 and should be covered by
medical insurance, Kerner said. That's about the same as more
traditional sinus surgeries, except that they sometimes also
require a night in the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The technological breakthrough is good news to people like Fox
and 59-year-old Gene Brundage of Granada Hills, who suffer from a
severe sinus infection called acute sinusitis. The infection,
common among those who suffer serious allergies, leads to swollen
tissues that prevent mucus from draining from the sinuses, which
can lead to complications ranging from constant, agonizing
headaches to loss of the ability to hear, smell or taste.
</P>
<P>
   Sinusitis feels like an allergy attack that won't go away,
Brundage said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a cold, you're sniffling a lot,'' he said. ``But it
doesn't go away. It just gets worse.''
</P>
<P>
   About 35 million Americans suffer from sinusitis, according to
the American Society of Otolaryngology _ Head and Neck Surgery.
Many people dismiss the infection as a typical allergy attack or
cold, but there are some differences.
</P>
<P>
   The society suggests seeing a doctor if: headaches and sinus
pressure last more than a few days; nasal discharge is a
yellow-green color (compared to more normal clear or white
discharge); or coughing and congestion last more than 10 days. Bad
breath and a fever also can indicate sinusitis instead of allergies
or a common cold.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, most cases can be treated with prescription drugs.
But more than half a million people a year seek surgery to correct
the malady _ often because the blockage is preventing medicine from
reaching the infected area.
</P>
<P>
   That's what happened to Brundage, a singer and actor in musicals
who can't afford to have the constant sniffles that accompany
chronic sinusitis. Unlike Fox, Brundage's blockage _ a combination
of infected sinuses and benign nasal polyp tumors _ wasn't painful,
but it was a nuisance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so gradual as it happens to you, your body just
compensates,'' Brundage said. ``I thought I just had another sinus
infection. I've had sinus infections for a million years because I
live in L.A., and I live in the Valley, which I've been told is the
worst place on Earth to live if you have bad allergies.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerner convinced a reluctant Brundage to try InstaTrak Surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm fine. I've noticed it's a little easier to breath,''
Brundage said. ``When the doctor first told me about it, I said,
`Oh, I don't think so.' But when I did it, it was nothing. Of
course, I !ital!was!off! out at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox's blockage was worse _ so the aftereffects of the surgery
have been much more painful. It took about two days for the pain to
turn to discomfort.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel fine,'' Fox said three days after his surgery. ``I can
get air through my nose now. If this is an indication of what my
nose will be like at the end of the healing process, I should be
feeling really good. I can actually feel a difference inside my
nose. It's bigger inside, as odd as that sounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure this will absolutely change my life, and I'm grateful
for that,'' he continued. ``Dr. Kerner was the first doctor who
looked up my nose and said, `I can fix this.' I just wish I'd known
about this sooner.'' &UR;  &QL;

COURT OF APPEALS KO ' S TAX DOLLARS FOR RELIGIOUS SCHOOLS

<P>
   On May 27, the U.S. First Circuit Court of Appeals
short-circuited any attempt to pass school voucher laws that
transmit taxpayer dollars into religious schools. The ruling
directly affects the states and territories under its jurisdiction:
Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Puerto Rico.
However, the court's ruling will be felt by every state of the
nation. This is the first religious voucher case to reach the
federal appellate level.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was a clear victory for opponents of voucher
systems that would put public funds into religious schools. It was
a clear victory for those who understand constitutional history and
the founders' mandate to keep church and state separated.
</P>
<P>
   This court case arose in Maine. The state legislature had
enacted a statute that provides schooling for students who live in
rural communities that don't have any public schools. For these
students, the state pays grants directly to qualified private
schools that are non-sectarian.
</P>
<P>
   Maine's Constitution and its Declaration of Rights do not
specifically prohibit the payment of tax dollars to religious
schools. Article I, Section 3 of the state's Declaration of Rights
proclaims that `no subordination nor preference of any one sect or
denomination to another shall ever be established by law.` But less
than two months ago, the Maine Supreme Court upheld the state law
that excludes taxpayer funding for religious schools.
</P>
<P>
   Elwood Strout and other parents challenged the law in federal
court claiming that it discriminates against religious schools and
violates their religious liberty. The parents, who live in rural
areas that do not have public schools, wanted the state to pay the
tuition for their children to attend St. Dominic's Regional High
School, a private sectarian school in Lewiston.
</P>
<P>
   The parents lost at the federal district court level and
appealed.
</P>
<P>
   In the case (Strout vs. Commissioner, Maine Department of
Education), the unanimous appeals court issued a sweeping decision
that declares, in part: ``A statement to the effect that `Congress
shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion,' U.S.
Const. amend. 1, is hardly equivocal language. ... Separation of
church and state constituted a paramount principle and goal in the
minds of some of the most influential of the Framers both by dint
of historical experience, and personal conviction.''
</P>
<P>
   Further in the decision, the court declares, ``Upholding the
Establishment Clause, which is aimed at avoiding an entangled
church and state, is such a paramount interest. In the long run, an
entanglement of the two has been shown by history to be oppressive
of religious freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   The court made short work of the parents' claim that the Maine
law violates the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment and
thereby their religious freedom. The court pointed out that the law
`does not prevent attendance at a religious school. Nor does it
prevent religious education of children in Maine. All it means is
that the cost of religious education must be borne by the parents
and not the state.`
</P>
<P>
   At the conclusion of the decision, the court agrees that parents
have `a fundamental right to direct the upbringing and education of
their children.` However, the court notes, ``that fundamental right
does not require the state to directly pay for a sectarian
education. Here, the statute does not prevent the parents from
doing what they wish; it only prevents the state from helping pay
for their wishes.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bill of Rights protects an individual's fundamental
liberties from encroachment by the government. Freedom of speech,
as guaranteed by the First Amendment, does not force that the
government pay to print the pamphlets that someone wishes to
distribute. Nor can a citizen demand that the government buy him a
gun because the Second Amendment guarantees ``the right of the
people to keep and bear arms.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a major loss for the religious right, which wants to tap
taxpayer dollars for the honor of sending their children to
sectarian schools. The American Center for Law and Justice, founded
by TV preacher Pat Robertson, made a tactical error by involving
itself in this case and taking it to the First Circuit Court of
Appeals. There was little hope of winning, a summary judgement at
the district court level should have indicated as much. The Maine
Supreme Court's own ruling in a similar case should have alerted
ACLJ to forego an appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps ACLJ has money to burn. According to a news story in The
Virginian Pilot, June 2, Robertson recently reached a deal with
Liberian dictator Charles Taylor which allows Robertson's company,
Freedom Gold Ltd., to mine for gold in the Bukon Jedeh region of
Liberia. The Virginian Pilot sketched Taylor's escapades: He fled
to the United States in 1983 after allegedly stealing $1 million
from the Liberian government. He escaped from a Massachusetts jail
in 1985, and four years later started a bloody civil war in
Liberia. But this isn't the first mining deal Robertson has made
with dictators. In the early 1990s, he made a deal with Zaire's
dictator Mobutu Sese Seko to dig for diamonds.
</P>
<P>
   It would have been wiser if Robertson had simply offered to pay
for the Strouts and the other parents to send their children to a
religious school of their choice.
</P>
<P>
   Now, there is a firm decision by a federal appellate court that
cannot be ignored by other federal districts. And the moves in
various state legislatures to pass voucher laws will be stymied.
This is a clear indication that such laws will be challenged in
federal court. And will likely be struck down.
</P>
<P>
   If we are to remain faithful to the intent of the founders and
the religious clauses of the First Amendment, American taxpayers
must never be forced to subsidize religious institutions.
Fortunately, the First Circuit Court of Appeals recognized that
truth.

POLLS GIVES DAVIS HIGH RATINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SALLADAY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ Gov. Gray Davis' reputation appears to have
thrived among California's Hispanic population despite criticism
over his handling of a ballot initiative designed to cut off
government services to illegal immigrants, a new survey shows.
</P>
<P>
   The survey of California voters, taken a week after Davis hosted
a three-day visit by Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo, shows 75
percent of Hispanic voters rate Davis' job performance as
``excellent or good.'' Davis, a Democrat, recently angered Hispanic
advocates by sending the fate of Proposition 187 to a court
mediator instead of dropping his defense of the anti-illegal
immigrant measure altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Davis got high marks among all voters surveyed as well, with 56
percent of them giving him the two highest ratings and 36 percent
saying he was doing a ``fair or poor job'' after six months in
office.
</P>
<P>
   In comparison, former Gov. Pete Wilson scored a 15 percent
``excellent or good'' poll rating in his early years in office _ at
the time of a brutal recession _ and former Gov. Ronald Reagan
never got higher than a 42 percent ``excellent or good'' rating
from the Field Poll during his two terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this shows is that `It's the economy, stupid,''' said Del
Ali of Research 2000 in Rockville, Md., which conducted the poll
for the San Francisco Examiner and KTVU-TV. ``Despite what you may
think on Proposition 187, Gray is not a confrontational or
controversial character. He's just right in the middle of the road,
right where you should be.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican consultant Dan Schnur conceded that the governor is
doing at least part of his job well.
</P>
<P>
   ``When economic times are good, what you want is the most
cautious, risk-adverse, impossibly inert governor you could
possibly find. By that measure, he's doing a hell of a job,''
Schnur said.
</P>
<P>
   The Examiner-KTVU poll on Davis' performance was part of a
larger statewide survey that asked voters their views on the
upcoming U.S. Senate race, a school voucher initiative, and another
March 2000 ballot measure that would outlaw gay marriages.
</P>
<P>
   Davis was elected last year by a 20-point margin over
then-Attorney General Dan Lungren. It was one of the biggest
landslides in California history, and it came, analysts believe,
because voters felt turned off by Lungren's conservatism and
comfortable with Davis' centrist mantra.
</P>
<P>
   As for Davis' apparent support among Hispanic voters, Garry
South, a political adviser to the governor, said: ``Most Latino
voters are moderate in nature. They didn't appreciate 187 ... but
they are far more concerned about their daily lives.''
</P>
<P>
   In the poll, only 13 percent of Republicans said they think
Davis is doing a poor job. Thirty-nine percent of Republicans think
he's doing an ``excellent or good'' job.
</P>
<P>
   The Research 2000 pollsters questioned 810 registered voters
across California May 27-29. The survey attempted to match the
racial makeup and party affiliations of the state's registered
voters. Among the other findings:
</P>
<P>
   _ A measure to outlaw gay marriages in California is getting
less- than-expected support, with only 54 percent of those surveyed
saying they would vote for the initiative next year.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., continues to dominate any
match-up with the current field of Republicans considering a run
against her next year. She remains one of the most popular and
well-recognized politicians in California, with 57 percent of those
surveyed having a favorable view of her. One-third of those
surveyed held an unfavorable opinion of her after seven years in
office.
</P>
<P>
   The two highest-ranking Republicans in the state _ Insurance
Commissioner Chuck Quackenbush and Secretary of State Bill Jones _
both score well compared with other Republicans in a theoretical
contest against Feinstein, but many Californians don't recognize
their names.
</P>
<P>
   _ According to the poll, those surveyed don't like a March 2000
ballot initiative that would allow taxpayer-supported vouchers so
people can send their children to private or parochial schools. A
similar measure on the November 1993 ballot only got 30 percent of
the vote.
</P>
<P>
   The poll showed 54 percent of those surveyed oppose the measure,
compared to 41 percent in favor. Asians, Hispanics and blacks
particularly oppose the initiative, according to the poll _ with
opposition ranging from 68 percent to 71 percent.

 &HT;    TIME TO 'BREAK THE SILENCE' ON MENTAL ILLNESS, MRS. GORE SAYS
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Tipper Gore hosted the first-ever White House
conference on mental health Monday, continuing her own recovery
from depression as she aided the Clinton administration's efforts
to battle the stigma of mental illness.
</P>
<P>
   With her husband, Vice President Al Gore, at her side, Mrs. Gore
convened the one-day conference with her first discussion in a
public forum of her own battle with depression following the
life-threatening injuries to her son in a car accident in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mental illness is not just something that happens to other
people, somebody over there,'' she said. ``We have to realize that
it happens in our American families, in our American communities,
and that means it calls on a response from all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gore told the conference it was time to ``break the
silence'' about mental illness, the way it was with cancer and AIDS
in previous decades, to encourage those suffering from mental
health problems to seek help.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must recognize mental illness for what it is _ it is an
illness that can be treated, and it can be treated successfully,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton used the conference to announce a $7.3 million
study of mental illness by the National Institute of Mental Health.
He also ordered the 285 health plans used by federal employees to
cover mental illness and substance abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirty-six years ago, President Kennedy said we had to return
mental health to the mainstream of American medicine,'' Clinton
said. ``Thirty-six years ago he said it, and we're still waiting.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House also announced a national training program for
teachers to identify and help troubled children, an idea stemming
from the recent student shootings in Colorado and Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   The conference, held at Howard University in Washington, was
linked to more than 1,000 sites nationwide by satellite and
involved five Cabinet secretaries and 20 members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In recent interviews about her depression, Mrs. Gore has
declined to discuss her symptoms or the treatment she underwent.
But Monday, she disclosed that she sought professional help after
friends told her, as she put it, ``I was not myself.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president, the leading candidate for the Democratic
presidential nomination, told the conference that the Gore family
learned from his wife's experience that ``when mental illness
strikes, it affects not only the person who is involved but the
entire family.'' He said his family became ``much stronger'' as a
result of the experience, but did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, too, praised the Gores as examples of how to deal with
mental illness in a family. And he added a political tone to the
conference in observing that the Gores have done more than others
in turning ``family values into real concrete improvement'' for
average Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton at the
conference also highlighted the ever increasing importance of
politics in White House events. Mrs. Clinton, who said ``we should
do whatever it takes to remove the stigma from mental illness,'' is
preparing to run for the U.S. Senate in New York.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the least political of the primary participants in the
conference was Mrs. Gore, who has long championed the issue of
mental illness, her interest in the subject stemming to her
childhood and her mother's periodic bouts with clinical depression.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked her to be my national adviser for mental illness
because she knows more and cares more about this issue than anyone
else I personally know,'' the president said of Mrs. Gore, who does
volunteer work with the mentally ill and homeless in Washington and
who has two degrees related to family therapy.

SYSTEMS DESIGNED TO HOLD A HOMEMADE SUN 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MALCOLM W. BROWNE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scientists have developed a variety of devices and systems in
which they hope to be able to compress hydrogen to the densities
and temperatures needed to sustain thermonuclear fusion reactions.
Among them are these: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TOKAMAKS
</P>
<P>
   Tokamaks, reactors that are shaped like doughnuts and occupy
large buildings, are chambers from which air has been removed and
into which is injected a diffuse plasma of hydrogen isotopes,
especially mixtures of deuterium and tritium. The plasma, a hot,
electrically charged gas, is compressed within the doughnut by two
sets of magnetic fields, one in which the magnetic field circles
the doughnut the long way around and the other in which the
magnetic field lines run the short way around the doughnut tube.
</P>
<P>
   By varying the geometry and strength of the fields, they can be
adjusted to produce a uniform compressive force on the plasma. But
even with uniform compression, turbulence and instabilities develop
in a tokamak's plasma, cooling it and enormously complicating the
goal of achieving sustained fusion.
</P>
<P>
   To ignite fusion, the compressed plasma in a tokamak must be
raised to the temperature of the Sun, and various strategies have
been developed for this. Part of the necessary heating is achieved
simply by compressing the plasma. Another technique involves
passing an electric current through the plasma, thus heating it in
the same way electricity heats a toaster wire.
</P>
<P>
   Heating can also be achieved by ducting microwave energy into
the plasma, and another technique heats the plasma by shooting
beams of neutral particles into it from an accelerator. Once fusion
is initiated, helium ions (also called alpha particles) produced by
the fusion of hydrogen nuclei transfer their energy to the plasma
and help to heat it.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of tokamaks have been built and tested in many countries.
Although the United States withdrew from a project called the
International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor _ a huge tokamak
the planning for which has already consumed $1 billion _ Russia,
Europe and Japan are continuing some work on the machine. But
prospects for financing the project to completion seem bleak.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the largest existing tokamaks continue to produce
impressive fusion pulses. The Joint European Torus in England
achieved a record for fusion power in a burst of 20 million watts. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SPHERICAL TORUS MACHINES
</P>
<P>
   These are similar to tokamaks, in that they compress plasma fuel
within toruses using interlocking magnetic fields. But they have
much thinner cores than ordinary tokamaks, giving them a shape more
similar to that of an apple than a doughnut. Their more or less
spherical shape permits more efficient compression of plasma than
can be achieved in a conventional tokamak.
</P>
<P>
   A small spherical torus built and tested in Britain has already
proved to have a very high ratio of plasma compression to magnetic
field strength. Improving this ratio is a major goal of all
magnetic confinement fusion devices.
</P>
<P>
   The Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory has built a somewhat
larger spherical torus reactor that is scheduled to begin an
experimental program in August. Scientists believe that this type
of reactor, with a tight magnetic field passing through its core,
may be able to compress plasma and reach fusion conditions more
cheaply than is possible with conventional tokamaks.
</P>
<P>
   Princeton's National Spherical Torus Experiment will not achieve
fusion, but it will allow operators to experiment with a wide
variety of conditions. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   STELLARATORS
</P>
<P>
   Like tokamaks, these are more or less doughnut shaped, but their
magnetic fields are designed to shape the compressed plasma into a
warped helix with many kinks. Unlike a tokamak, a stellarator need
not be perfectly symmetrical. Its configuration is believed to
control plasma turbulence more efficiently than does a tokamak. Oak
Ridge National Laboratory and the Princeton laboratory hope to get
federal financing next year to build a small stellarator of
advanced design. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LEVITATED DIPOLE EXPERIMENT
</P>
<P>
   This scheme, a joint project of the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology and Columbia University, is one of several based on
highly speculative ideas that fusion scientists have identified as
worth a small exploratory investment of several million dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The levitated dipole idea came in 1987 to Dr. Akira Hasegawa,
who was working at Bell Laboratories at the time and analyzing data
from the Voyager flybys of Jupiter and its moons. Hasegawa was
inspired by the discovery that Jupiter's magnetic field seemed to
be able to capture and confine plasma reaching it from both the
solar wind and the moon Io, and he theorized that similar plasma
confinement might be achieved in the laboratory with a magnetically
levitated superconducting coil playing Jupiter's role.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists in charge of the present attempt to put
Hasegawa's idea into practice are Dr. Michael E. Mauel of Columbia
and Dr. Jay Kesner of MIT.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Department of Energy held a competition two years ago for
the funding of new experiments, and out of 42 proposals two were
chosen, including ours,'' Kesner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd think that this model for plasma confinement would have
occurred to someone a long time ago,'' he said, ``but plasma
researchers didn't know there were plasmas captured by
magnetospheres surrounding planets.''
</P>
<P>
   Kesner and Mauel are building a doughnut-shaped superconducting
magnet that will weigh about half a ton. When finished, the magnet
will be suspended in a vacuum chamber supported solely by a
feedback-controlled magnetic field. The two scientists expect to
float their heavy magnet in the empty space within their test
chamber for at least eight hours at a time.
</P>
<P>
   An electric current introduced into the superconducting magnet
will continue to flow indefinitely, because a superconductor offers
no resistance to electricity. This, the scientists hope, will
create a magnetic field capable of drawing in charged plasma.
</P>
<P>
   Whether such a device could ever be used to raise plasma to
fusion temperature remains to be seen, and it is probable that even
if it did, Kesner said, the fuel would have to be an exotic mixture
of deuterium and helium-3 _ a fuel that would not heat up the
ultracold magnet and destroy its superconductivity by emitting
swarms of high-energy neutrons.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is that helium-3 is very rare on Earth, and the
necessary quantities might be available only on the Moon, where it
is created by the impact of cosmic rays on the lunar surface.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a floating dipole reactor could efficiently power a
long-endurance rocket that might one day be sent to a nearby star,
the scientists believe. &QL;
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   ENGINEERING STUDIES
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists and engineers have argued that fusion energy is
inherently impractical because a fusion reactor costing billions of
dollars would quickly wear out. The flood of very high-energy
neutrons produced by hydrogen fusion penetrates metal and disrupts
its crystalline structure, causing it to expand and become
dangerously brittle. If the neutron bombardment were to reach the
metal wall of a reactor's vacuum chamber, the entire chamber could
eventually collapse, destroying the reactor.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the latest reactor plans call for capturing the neutrons
in a metal ``blanket'' (probably made of lithium) surrounding the
hot plasma fuel. The neutrons would heat the blanket, and this heat
would be transferred to a steam boiler to power a conventional
turbine. The lithium blanket and some other internal components of
the reactor would wear out in a few years, but could be
periodically removed and replaced at relatively modest cost. The
main part of the reactor would be spared. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   INERTIAL CONFINEMENT
</P>
<P>
   Besides compressing and igniting fusion fuel magnetically, the
fusion reactions could also be ignited by an implosion as in
hydrogen bombs.
</P>
<P>
   In an inertial confinement reactor, the mixture of deuterium and
tritium fuel is encapsulated as a thin frozen coating on the inside
of tiny plastic hollow spheres. For each shot, a sphere is encased
in a metal ``hohlraum,'' a chamber about the size of a pencil
eraser placed at the focus point of 192 powerful lasers.
</P>
<P>
   When the lasers hit the hohlraum, it emits a blast of X-rays
that vaporize and compress the fuel sphere it encloses, imploding
the sphere and raising the temperature of the fuel inside it to the
ignition point, 100 million degrees Celsius or so. During the brief
fusion reaction that ensues, the immense energy it produces is
absorbed by a surrounding metal ``blanket,'' which transfers heat
to a steam-powered electric generating plant.
</P>
<P>
   This will be the basis of the $1.2 billion National Ignition
Facility under construction at Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory in California. Because experiments using the machine
will help to monitor the combat readiness of America's arsenal of
nuclear weapons, part of its financing comes from the Department of
Energy weapons program. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Z PINCH
</P>
<P>
   A variant of inertial confinement fusion called a ``Z pinch'' is
under development at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque,
N.M.
</P>
<P>
   This device would implode little thermonuclear fuel capsules
like those the Livermore laboratory is developing, but without
lasers. Instead, scientists have invented a cylindrical array of
very fine tungsten wires and a gigantic capacitor, a device that
can store and instantaneously discharge huge electric charges.
</P>
<P>
   When the Sandia capacitor is fired, it sends a current of 20
million amperes through the fine wires in the Z pinch, and the
wires are converted into super-hot plasma. The plasma is driven
inward upon itself by the huge magnetic field produced by the
sudden current. The collision of the imploding plasma generates a
gigantic X-ray pulse and this, it is hoped, can implode fuel
capsules to reach ignition.
</P>
<P>
   The Z pinch and a more powerful successor planned by Sandia, the
X-1, will not ignite a sustained reaction but should produce a
pulse of fusion.

<P>
   SPARTANBURG, S.C. _ Two years ago, Van Epps rode onto the pages
of cycling's record books.
</P>
<P>
   He became the first person on an arm-powered cycle to complete
the Assault on Mount Mitchell, a 105-mile ride from Spartanburg to
the summit of the highest mountain in North Carolina. And he's done
it twice since then.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, Epps is disabled. He lost his right leg eight years
ago in a bicycle accident. He spent months in the hospital and has
undergone more than a dozen surgery related to the injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Epps left another set of tire tracks in the books.
</P>
<P>
   The 35-year-old cyclist became the first person riding an
arm-powered cycle to qualify for the prestigious 750-mile
Paris-Brest-Paris ride.
</P>
<P>
   The bicycle ride through France began in 1891 and takes place
every four years. This year's event begins Aug. 23. Because of its
length, it is considered one of the toughest cycling events in
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Qualifying is big,'' Epps said. ``Going over there is bigger.
There will be no support help; just me and the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Epps conquered the 6,684-foot Mount Mitchell for the third time
in the middle of May. Then, he qualified for the Paris-Brest-Paris
on a large tricycle called a Freedom Ryder.
</P>
<P>
   Paris-Brest-Paris is billed as a ride, not a race. Cyclists,
however, must complete it in no more than 80 hours. Riders are
eliminated if they don't make it to checkpoints on time.
</P>
<P>
   To qualify, Epps had to complete four long-distance rides within
a certain period of time. The distances ranged from 125 to 375
miles.
</P>
<P>
   For Epps, and the other riders who will tackle the
Paris-Brest-Paris challenge, it is a personal race against the
clock. Riders are allowed to rest, or even sleep, as long as they
reach the checkpoints in time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The riders with legs have more time to rest because they're
faster,'' said Epps, a high school teacher who lives in
Spartanburg.
</P>
<P>
   He will have additional time if his mentor and trainer, John
Bryan, is successful with his training plan that would move Epps
from a tricycle onto a two-wheel bike.
</P>
<P>
   But first, Bryan has to teach Epps how to ride the custom
two-wheeler.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he can learn to ride it, he'll pick up one to one and a
half miles per hour,'' Bryan said. ``Over the course of 750 miles,
that'll give him 10 hours he can sleep and rest. That's the only
way Van will be able to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryan's plan draws on his 45 years experience as a mechanical
engineer. He has designed a way to install small wheels that Epps
can lower with a lever to prevent him from toppling over at low
speeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess you could call them training wheels,'' Bryan said.
``Able-bodied riders can put the legs down to stabilize themselves.
Van can't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryan, 64, knows about the Paris-Brest-Paris ride from
experience when he finished the course in 1983. ``I cherish this,''
he said, showing off the medal he received for finishing the ride.
</P>
<P>
   The Paris-Brest-Paris course covers a meandering route through
the French countryside, from Paris to the Brittany Coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the riders who've qualified are physically strong,'' Bryan
said. ``The question is, `Are they mentally ready?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Bryan is the founder and promoter of the Assault on Mount
Mitchell bicycle ride, an event that will celebrate its 25th
anniversary next May. He is also an official qualifier for the
Paris-Brest-Paris, in charge of an area covering several southern
states.
</P>
<P>
   Bryan's encouragement helped Epps return to riding after his
accident, spurred him to try the Assault on Mount Mitchell and gave
him the confidence to try for Paris-Brest-Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ``The French are going to be skeptical when Van shows up,''
Byran said. ``But after he passes a few of the checkpoints, the
word will pass all up and down that highway. They'll all know about
him.''

GUIDE TO L.A. HISTORY COLLECTIONS PUBLISHED

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Culminating a four-year project involving the
Getty Research Institute and 200 Los Angeles cultural
organizations, the first directory of little-known archives and
historical collections about the history of Los Angeles was
published Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The project was coordinated by L.A. as Subject, a research
project of the Getty Research Institute, in partnership with local
community museums, libraries, government offices, universities,
neighborhood organizations, places of worship, and individual
scholars and artists.
</P>
<P>
   The 350-page ``Cultural Inheritance/L.A.: A Resource Directory
of Less Visible Archives and Collections in the Los Angeles
Region'' identifies and defines 178 private and public archives and
collections, including documents, photographs and other primary
source materials.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these resources are unpublished and have not been easily
accessible to scholars, researchers and artists. Among those
collections included are the Antelope Valley Indian Museum;
Department of History, California State University, Northridge;
Glendale Central Library, Special Collections; Records Center, City
of Burbank; the Automobile Club of Southern California's History
Archive; Sephardic Temple Tifereth Israel; the Public Utilities
Center; the International Gay and Lesbian Archive; the Italian Oral
History Project; and the archives and collections of the Western
States Black Resource and Educational Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to shed light on interesting resources about the
history and culture of the Los Angeles region that until now have
either been on the margins of credible source materials, or simply
not known,'' said Karen Stokes, project manager for L.A. as
Subject. ``We hope the directory will be indispensable as a
resource tool in promoting new research, scholarship, and artistic
production about the Los Angeles region.''
</P>
<P>
   The directory, accompanied by an online version, was released
Monday at a two-day Getty symposium. (The online address is:
www.getty.edu/gri/public/lasubject.htm.) Titled ``Mapping L.A.: A
Global Prototype,'' the event is bringing together scholars,
researchers and community heritage preservations, using ``mapping''
as a metaphor for how Los Angeles is studied, examined and
translated. Participants are examining methods and practices of
mapping _ social, cognitive, political, electronic and cartographic
_ and the implications of drawing them together.
</P>
<P>
   In conjunction with the launch of the directory, exhibitions at
two venues are showcasing local archives and collections.
``Illuminating Visual Culture, Artifacts, and Documents: The Harbor
and Coastal Cities Corridor'' at the Social and Public Art Resource
Center in Venice features cultural materials that reflect the
transformative histories of communities in the coastal cities
between Ventura and Orange counties. This exhibition will run
through July 22. ``Expressions in the Gallery: Less Visible Culture
in the Central City Corridor'' at the Watts Labor Community Action
Committee represents the social, cultural and economic histories of
communities in the area bounded by L.A. Civic Center to the north,
East Los Angeles to the east, West Los Angeles to the west and
Watts to the south. It will run through June 30. &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ Ever since he was kicked out of the White House
inner circle for carelessly cavorting with a prostitute, political
consultant-turned-pundit Dick Morris has been vengefully dumping on
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's publicly turned against Hillary Clinton, too, brashly
predicting in the Hill, a weekly newspaper that covers Congress,
that if she runs for the U.S. Senate from New York, she will surely
lose.
</P>
<P>
   What brass. What balderdash.
</P>
<P>
   Morris contends the first lady's issues will be mushy with a
moderate Republican opponent and that she _ like other women
candidates without issues, will come across as ``strident, bitchy,
arrogant and contentious.''
</P>
<P>
   Further, he says she can't fight off the carpetbagger charge and
is so well known that she'll never get more support than she has
right now. A recent trial heat shows her losing to New York GOP
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani by 43.7 percent to 49.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Wow. Take that, tough lady. Morris didn't even go into other
complaints that she will siphon funds and attention from less
famous Democratic candidates, unite Republicans tired of the very
name Clinton and confuse voters who expect her to huddle over her
own hearthstone and tend to her duties as first lady.
</P>
<P>
   Morris's real zinger is his claim that ``everybody in New York
state knows all there is to know about the first lady. Any vote she
doesn't get right now she isn't going to get as the race unfolds.
But (Giuliani) is not well known in parts of upstate. As his
recognition increases ... he will increase his vote share and widen
his lead over Hillary.''
</P>
<P>
   How did Morris ever get a reputation as a big political thinker?
He makes an assumption that the more people get to know Giuliani,
the better they will like him. But wait a minute. Maybe ignorance
is bliss. Maybe a smart-aleck Manhattan mayor won't translate well
in upstate New York. It's a definite possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Morris makes a second silly assumption that Hillary Clinton's
image is frozen in the public mind. But which image? She transforms
herself regularly and is undoubtedly about to do it again. She has
played more parts in the White House than Judi Dench has on stage.
</P>
<P>
   We could put this rubbish down to the customary partisan
campaign clang. But the sexist undertone is painfully striking, as
outrageous as it is unmistakable, a barely disguised double
standard imposed on her candidacy traceable to the fact that she is
female.
</P>
<P>
   Naively, we of her gender had thought the worst was behind us
with Geraldine Ferraro and the increasing number of women in
Congress. To judge by the early attacks on Hillary Clinton, we
ain't seen nothin' yet.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Breslin, the New York Post's blue-collar columnist,
incredibly admonished the first lady: ``Please don't cry when you
lose.'' What patronizing poppycock. Has this man been on an
isolated desert island the past six years? She never cries in
public. Bill cries, Ronald Reagan cried. But Hillary does not.
</P>
<P>
   She is being tackled for never having lived in New York state or
spending much time there, although legally she is required to have
a local residence only on Election Day 2000. Yet precedents exist
for male political carpetbagging all over the country.
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers elected Robert Kennedy of Massachusetts in 1964 and
James Buckley of Connecticut in 1970 to the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   New Yorker John D. ``Jay'' Rockefeller IV moved to West Virginia
for the sole purpose of seeking office there and has held its
junior Senate seat for 15 years. Rep. Patrick Kennedy, son of Sen.
Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, relocated his base to Rhode
Island for the same reason and is expected to seek a Senate seat
soon.
</P>
<P>
   Texan Michael Huffington moved to California to run for the
Senate, but throwing money around turned out to be his only
political idea and he deservedly lost. Many others over the decades
have uprooted themselves to find an electoral environment more
agreeable than their native soil. Why not Hillary Clinton?
</P>
<P>
   Other critics describe the first lady as audacious and vain for
daring to run for the Senate without previously having held an
elective public office. She is depicted as having sinister motives
of revenge, rather than the familiar unisex ambition for power
common to all politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Congress is full of doctors, lawyers and business executives
who had never previously stood for election and who won because of
_ rather than in spite of _ their ``outsider'' status. Of the 74
Republican freshmen elected to the House in 1994, 48 had no
legislative experience and many had not held any state office.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans Steve Forbes, Patrick Buchanan, Elizabeth Dole and
Gary Bauer are campaigning for no less than the presidency, the
highest political honor we can bestow, without having first held
any other elective office.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Hillary Clinton is a mere wife. The same critics who
decry her qualifications also dredge up stale controversies that
sprang from her obvious influence over public policy.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans cite her failed health care reforms during Bill
Clinton's firs

<P>
   Texan Michael Huffington moved to California to run for the
Senate, but throwing money around turned out to be his only
political idea and he deservedly lost. Many others over the decades
have uprooted themselves to find an electoral environment more
agreeable than their native soil. Why not Hillary Clinton?
</P>
<P>
   Other critics describe the first lady as audacious and vain for
daring to run for the Senate without previously having held an
elective public office. She is depicted as having sinister motives
of revenge, rather than the familiar unisex ambition for power
common to all politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Congress is full of doctors, lawyers and business executives
who had never previously stood for election and who won because of
_ rather than in spite of _ their ``outsider'' status. Of the 74
Republican freshmen elected to the House in 1994, 48 had no
legislative experience and many had not held any state office.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans Steve Forbes, Patrick Buchanan, Elizabeth Dole and
Gary Bauer are campaigning for no less than the presidency, the
highest political honor we can bestow, without having first held
any other elective office.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Hillary Clinton is a mere wife. The same critics who
decry her qualifications also dredge up stale controversies that
sprang from her obvious influence over public policy.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans cite her failed health care reforms during Bill
Clinton's first term as an example of frightening, liberal,
big-government tendencies. But the adequacy of medical care remains
a major issue and the first lady is on the right side there.
</P>
<P>
   The dwindling Whitewater investigation by Independent Counsel
Kenneth Starr drags on, with no public resolution yet of questions
about her role in missing law firm records, travel office firings,
real estate investment deals and commodities futures trades. But
Republicans who think she can be tarred much more than she already
has been with those old scandals are dreaming.
</P>
<P>
   It is not even certain that Giuliani, widely expected to be her
opponent, can win his expected GOP primary against Rep. Rick Lazio
of Long Island, who is backed by New York Gov. George Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   For Hillary Clinton, winning the Senate seat would be the
equivalent of winning an Oscar and a Tony in the same year, as
Dench just did. It is a goal worth pursuing, but she will have to
earn it.

CLINTON TO SEEK MEDICARE EXPANSION TO COVER DRUGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton is preparing one of the last
major domestic initiatives of his presidency _ a politically
appealing but expensive proposal to have Uncle Sam pay part of the
bill for prescription drugs for nearly 40 million Americans over
age 65.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton may outline the multibillion-dollar proposal before
leaving for the Group of Eight summit in Cologne, Germany, next
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   A senior White House official, speaking Monday on condition of
anonymity, said Clinton is weighing a variety of ways to pay for
the expanded Medicare coverage. Clinton may draw money from the
federal budget surplus, finance part of the plan through Medicare
cost savings or obtain co-payments from beneficiaries, the official
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever option the president decides upon, the cost to the
beneficiary will be substantially below the costs the elderly bear
from private insurance,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the source of funding, Clinton faces a tough sell on
Capitol Hill where the Republican-controlled House and Senate have
been leery of expanding Medicare coverage at a time when the
entitlement program already faces bankruptcy in 2015.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. William Roth, R-Del., chairman of the Senate Finance
Committee, said last month that his panel would not take up
Medicare reform until late summer at the earliest _ a timetable
that virtually forestalls final congressional action this year.
</P>
<P>
   Studies show that elderly Americans face enormous costs from
prescription drugs, with 80 percent of retired people taking a
prescription drug each day. Drug prices rose 51 percent between
1990 and 1995 alone.
</P>
<P>
   A bipartisan Medicare commission led by Sen. John Breaux, D-La.,
and Rep. Bill Thomas, R-Calif., concluded earlier this year that
universal coverage for prescription drugs was too expensive because
it would cost $20 billion a year now _ and more when the Baby Boom
generation begins to retire in 2011.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the commission proposed Medicare coverage for
prescription drugs for couples with joint incomes of less than
$13,000. But the proposal failed to win majority support from the
commission and was dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, Medicare reimburses elderly Americans for hospital
costs and a share of costs for physicians. But Medicare does not
pay for prescription medications given outside a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   An official at the federal Health Care Finance Administration
which administers the Medicare program said Monday the Clinton
administration proposal will seek to expand prescription drug
subsidies currently provided to 6.7 million Medicare beneficiaries
who have elected to receive health care under health maintenance
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of those managed care plans have been offering drug
coverage _ either at a low cost or at no cost to the
beneficiaries,'' the HCFA official explained, speaking on condition
of anonymity. ``The White House plan would make that kind of
coverage available to other Medicare beneficiaries.''
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said Clinton would propose voluntary
co-paid prescription drug coverage for considerably less than the
$90 per month premium now available to the elderly under
supplemental insurance sold by private companies.
</P>
<P>
   White House chief of staff John Podesta said on CBS News' ``Face
the Nation'' that Clinton's plan would ask Medicare beneficiaries
to pay ``a modest premium.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But in exchange for that, they will have a prescription drug
benefit that's better than anything you could buy today in the open
market,'' he said.
</P>
<P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The White House warned in March that 15 million Medicare
beneficiaries ``have absolutely no prescription drug coverage,
millions more have totally inadequate coverage and our nation's
elderly are paying excessively high costs for their desperately
needed medications.'' The White House added: ``The president's
Medicare reform proposal will address these unmet challenges.''
</P>
<P>
   Providing prescription drug coverage for America's elderly
promises to be a hot issue in the presidential campaign in 2000.
Americans over age 60 voted for Republican candidates for the House
and Senate in 1998 _ a reversal in their support for Clinton in his
presidential campaigns in 1992 and 1996.

MAJOR CHANGES IN STORE FOR 100-YEAR-OLD YOSEMITE CAMP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LARRY D. HATFIELD  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK, Calif. _ When Camp Curry opened in this
majestic place 100 years ago this month, you could rent a tent for
$2 a day or $12 a week, get three squares a day and a clean napkin
with every meal.
</P>
<P>
   That year, 1899, only 4,500 people visited Yosemite, one of the
crown jewels of America's national parks. Some 290 of them stayed
in the 25 tents at Camp Curry.
</P>
<P>
   This year, more than 4.5 million people will trek to Yosemite
and about 333,000 of them will stay at Camp Curry, now called Curry
Village.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things have changed,'' Loy Cutshall said, sitting beneath
7,000-foot Glacier Point and admiring nearby Half Dome. ``But there
is something permanent here that won't ever change.''
</P>
<P>
   Loy and Robert Cutshall, of Brea, Calif., first saw Yosemite
more than 50 years ago as young camp workers. Both now 70, they
honeymooned here _ in Cabin 261 _ and will celebrate their 48th
wedding anniversary next week.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, along with the first big wave of summer season
tourists, they celebrated Camp Curry's 100th birthday in a series
of special events put on by the Yosemite Concession Services Corp.,
which now runs Curry Village. The nearly 1,200 square miles of
scenic wild lands that comprise the park itself were set aside in
1890.
</P>
<P>
   While visitors took a nostalgic look back at the past 100 years,
they also were taking an uneasy look forward to the next 100.
</P>
<P>
   The vast numbers of tourists have long put increasing pressure
on this narrow little valley carved into the middle of the Sierra
Nevada. Man's footprint has been ever larger and Mother Nature has
been fighting a losing battle.
</P>
<P>
   More than two years ago, Mother Nature struck back. On New
Year's Day 1997, heavy rains and a melting snowpack sent the Merced
River roaring out of its banks in the worst flooding in the valley
in 80 years.
</P>
<P>
   Roads, campgrounds and buildings were destroyed to the tune of
$178 million in damages.
</P>
<P>
   With the destruction came opportunity _ and controversy. The
National Park Service tried to combine repairs with the long-term
goal of reducing congestion and restoring the valley to a more
natural state.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the Park Service proposed moving 210
buildings and replacing 440 others of the original 495 rooms at the
Yosemite Lodge. That would involve building an access road closer
to the Merced, which has wild and scenic rivers protection, adding
bike and walking paths and relocating eight acres of parking.
</P>
<P>
   Climbers disagreed and sued to block the lodge redevelopment.
The Sierra Club also filed suit and, in October, U.S. District
Judge Charles Breyer agreed. It was back to the drawing boards.
</P>
<P>
   In December, Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt announced that the
Park Service was combining four separate park redevelopment plans
into one. A draft of that plan was due this month but has been put
off until early winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have listened to the public responses to previous planning
proposals and we got the message loud and clear,'' Babbitt said.
``It makes sense that we roll things into one comprehensive package
that can be reviewed in total.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taken together, it will meet our expectations to restore
natural areas and to protect resources while at the same time
improving the quality of visitor experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt may be overly optimistic about meeting expectations. The
$176 million Valley Implementation Plan, for instance, may include
proposals to move employee housing outside the park, to El Portal.
</P>
<P>
   That brought vigorous opposition last week from the descendants
of David and Jennie Curry, the Redwood City school teachers who
opened Camp Curry on June 1, 1899, because they wanted an
affordable alternative to the $4-a-day Sentinel Hotel in the
valley.
</P>
<P>
   Their grandsons _ David Curry of Berkeley and John Curry of
Hilton Head, S.C. _ say moving employee housing out of the park
would destroy one of the biggest incentives for young people to
work there.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 1,500 summer employees here and 500 in the winter
and most of them are here totally for the experience of living in
the park, not for the job,'' said John Curry, a resort consultant
who worked in Yosemite as a young man.
</P>
<P>
   ``And they are quality people. You couldn't get that employee if
it weren't for the ability to live in the park.''
</P>
<P>
   David Curry said part of the park's strengths is that workers
have a sense of community.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody is going to be attracted to this community if workers
are scattered somewhere outside the park, if their kids can't go to
school here. ... One hundred years of experience is being whittled
away.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are other controversies. The new master plan will contain
proposals to sharply limit vehicle traffic into the valley by
creating a central parking area and using shuttles to ferry
visitors into the park.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates say that would end the bumper-to-bus traffic that
pollutes the valley throughout the summer and, increasingly, in the
winter. Others argue it is just moving the problem.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a battle brewing pitting some counties around
Yosemite and conservationists against the Park Service over
development of a regional transit system feeding the park and over
the use of diesel buses.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of diesel-spewing buses ``are a step backwards, even
compared to cars, which I have no particular love for,'' said David
Brower, founder of Earth Island Institute and Friends of the Earth,
and onetime executive director of the Sierra Club.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter last week to California Department of
Transportation, Brower said the ``level of pollution generated by
diesel engines is unacceptable both for human health and for the
health of wildlife and trees in the Park.''

 &HT;    SHE SAID: A siren call a mother just can't resist
 &HT;    By Maureen Downey
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   One recent night while pacing the floor with a restless infant,
I decided that parents fall into two basic groups: those who let
their babies cry themselves to sleep and those who don't.
</P>
<P>
   I'm in the second group, which is why I'm writing this on
deadline instead of last night, when I should have. A 16-pound air
raid siren ran me off of my computer. Given the choice between
placating my editor or little Becca Lucia, I'll take my daughter.
She yells a lot louder.
</P>
<P>
   Most parents will stand outside their baby's room some nights,
resisting with every ounce of will the urge to dash in and snatch
up a crying infant. With our older two children I just gave up
immediately, rocking or nursing them to sleep against the advice of
the experts. My instincts then _ and now _ won't let me follow the
experts.
</P>
<P>
   I've been rewarded with warm, empathetic kids who won't let me
kill the bugs in the house. (I have to gently escort them outside.)
Neither of our older children has ever been bothered with
nightmares; neither tries to sneak into our bed in the middle of
the night.
</P>
<P>
   A friend shakes her head over my nighttime floor pacing and
insists I haven't learned a thing from having two older kids. She's
wrong. What I've learned is how quickly babies grow up and turn
into independent children who don't need rocking.
</P>
<P>
   Tomorrow, our oldest graduates from elementary school. She
doesn't need me to cuddle, or read from ``Goodnight Moon.'' She
closes her door at bedtime and rereads ``The Diary of Anne Frank.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's a good thing. Because now it's the twins' turn.
</P>
<P>
   When baby cries, it's time to get tough
</P>
<P>
   By Bo Emerson
</P>
<P>
   c. 1999 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   You've all heard this sound. It starts out as a wail, then turns
gutteral and strangulated, like a scary infant death rattle.
</P>
<P>
   This is my evening serenade. This is the time when Rebecca
Lucia, the usually delightful biscuit of love, becomes a raging,
head-spinning, Exorcist-style pocket monster. And her softhearted
mother, for the umpteenth time, will trot upstairs to rescue the
screaming angel from behind the bars of her prison crib.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, as I write this column, we've been through the ritual
yet again. We pretend to put her down, we wait through the screams,
then, against my stern protests, Maureen picks her back up. And
there they are, the picture of Madonna-ish tranquility, Becca
sucking away and Maureen giving me the hairy eyeball.
</P>
<P>
   The poor little thing rubs her eyes and puts her fist in her
mouth and is obviously tired. She should be. It's almost 11 p.m.
But unlike her brother Joseph, Becca does not like to sleep. She
does not go gently into that good night. She is dragged kicking and
screaming beneath the waters of sleep.
</P>
<P>
   The pediatrician tells us that at 5 months an infant can learn
to put herself to sleep. Most babies will resist at first, says the
doctor, but within three days the fight will dwindle to a few
moments of whimpering, and then it's off to dreamland.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, we haven't made it past Day One yet. In fact I think
Becca's stamina is actually increasing, as we train her to hold out
longer. (Her current record is 56 minutes.)
</P>
<P>
   I have no desire to let babies cry. But I don't think we should
practice this halfhearted tough love. I say let's soldier through,
at least one night. Or else let's just admit defeat, brew some
coffee and call it a slumber party.

 &HT;    `Army for the arts'
 &HT;    By Dan Hulbert
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Atlanta Arts Accords, a sort of cultural Magna
Carta proclaiming support for public funding of the arts, was
signed Monday by members of the national organizations of mayors,
governors, counties and state arts agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The signing ceremony at the Atlanta Hilton was a high point of
the four-day convention of Americans for the Arts, which ends
today. It is an unprecedented gathering of the group, an assembly
of arts supporters in government and business and an advocate for
the National Endowment for the Arts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an historic joining of a powerful army for the arts,''
said Fulton County Commission Vice Chairman Michael Hightower, a
member of the Americans for the Arts board, who signed on behalf of
the National Association of Counties.
</P>
<P>
   Adrian King, manager of arts and education programs for the
Coca-Cola Foundation, drew up the single-page document, which
affirms that ``public support for the arts . . . has been critical
in enhancing American civilization.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I sign this gratefully,'' a smiling William Ivey, chairman of
the NEA, said at the luncheon gathering of 800 delegates. Although
the NEA enjoys more support than at any time in the past decade,
Ivey has said that, as Congress debates President Clinton's
proposed 50 percent budget increase for the agency, ``This document
will be an important tool for me as I make the case for the arts.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Mayor Bill Campbell signed on behalf of the U.S.
Conference of Mayors.
</P>
<P>
   The convention began Saturday on an unabashedly boosterish note,
with Hightower welcoming delegates to ``the greatest city in the
greatest state in the country'' and exhorting them to ``spend lots
of money!'' The Fulton County Arts Council distributed tote bags
emblazoned with, ``Atlanta: The Heart of Southern Arts.'' Keynote
speeches by Johnnetta B. Cole, presidential distinguished professor
at Emory University, and Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.) kept delegates
buzzing about their passionate eloquence for the arts. Hundreds of
conventioneers sampled Atlanta theatrical productions and bus tours
organized by the cultural tourism department of the Atlanta
Convention and Visitors Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Another signature event was Monday's Youth Arts Summit.
Delegates were given studies showing the benefits of the arts to
economic development, education and in controlling juvenile
delinquency. But no one made the case more vividly than panelist
Aimee Chan, an 18-year-old senior at Woodward Academy.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my volunteer work I see children from homes so broken they
don't know right from wrong,'' said Chan before a ballroom crowd of
several hundred, ``but when you give them even the most basic arts
and crafts, you see this explosion of creativity. They have an
experience that no one else can imagine for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Barry Hessenius, president of the California Assembly of Local
Arts Assemblies, called the convention ``a great way for the arts
to learn about selling ourselves, because in the past we've been
lousy at that. We've let others define the arts as something
elitist. But now we have things like (the Accords) to hammer home
the message: `We're not a frill. We're as `core' as you can get.'

 &HT;    CNN Headline News getting a new format
 &HT;    By Jill Vejnoska
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's the deal: It's the news for people without much free
time. People with remotes.
</P>
<P>
   A bit succinct, perhaps, but that's right up CNN Headline News'
alley. On Monday, the cable network that provides the latest news
every half-hour unveiled format changes aimed at better serving its
younger-skew-
</P>
<P>
   ing, increasingly time-pressed, audience.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning at 6 p.m. June 15, there'll be more stories. Graphics
highlighting upcoming stories. Plus no more grouping of stories by
topics, such as politics, international news or _ where's that
clicker?! _ science and technology.
</P>
<P>
   And get ready, sports fans. That ticker of scores and stock info
will keep running onscreen, even when the network cuts away to
national commercials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the youngest demographics of all the news networks,''
said Headline News president Bob Furnad, who characterized
competitor MSNBC's audience as nearly six years older than Headline
News' ``time optimizers.'' ``(They're) people who are juggling work
and the gym and hobbies and family and have little time, but people
to whom news is important.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the major changes announced Monday:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  More news: Story count has already been increased by 50
percent each half-hour, Furnad said. Packages from CNN, which
generally run about two minutes, are being cut down by as much as
45 seconds. On Sunday nights and Monday mornings, ``Week
at-a-Glance'' will flag important upcoming events; on weekends,
``Headline News Best Bets on . . .'' will use input from Time Inc.
magazines to recommend movies, investments, etc.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Less ``flow'': That's news biz talk for grouping stories by
topics, which Headline News will eschew in hopes of keeping
viewers. Or maybe not. An onscreen ``sidebar'' will identify the
next two stories coming up on the news segment. ``We think that
time optimizers will find the network more useful,'' Furnad said.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Less repetition: The 24-hour broadcast day will be divided
into four, six-hour ``dayparts,'' each with its own name, on-air
color and anchor. (For instance, ``Third Watch,'' from 6 p.m. to
midnight, will feature popular anchor Lynne Russell and green as
its main color.) And with the exception of some major breaking
stories, one daypart's news packages won't repeat on another's.
``So if you saw a Wolf Blitzer package today at 7 a.m., you won't
see that Wolf Blitzer piece this afternoon between noon and six,''
Furnad vowed.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  More stocks and jocks: Furnad hears the most complaints about
the ``superticker'' disappearing during commercials. But now, the
onscreen ``crawl,'' featuring sports scores, stock quotes, state
news and weather, will be larger, easier-to-read _ and remain
visible during national advertising.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  More visibility: The network will spend several million
dollars on promotion _ both on sister channels and elsewhere _ in
an offbeat ad campaign created by a New York agency. It's the first
time Headline News has hired an outside agency to promote itself.

 &HT;    Bigger-than-life folks tackle heroes
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Debut issue
</P>
<P>
   To make sure their customers never get caught without
</P>
<P>
   anything to read, Starbucks
</P>
<P>
   has launched Joe, a magazine designed to stimulate
</P>
<P>
   coffeehouse conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Who better to write about heroes than heroes? That was the
thinking behind Time's ($3.95) ``Person of the Century'' project.
In the final installment of 20 nominees, Henry Aaron writes about
Jackie Robinson, and avid soccer fan Henry Kissinger offers his
views on Pele.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say certain people are bigger than life,'' Aaron writes,
``but Jackie Robinson is the only man I've known who truly was.''
</P>
<P>
   How was the list of nominees compiled? Time's editors say they
looked at people who liberated a segment of society. ``Jackie
Robinson broke the color line in baseball; Helen Keller demolished
old notions about the blind and deaf; Harvey Milk dared to put
himself on the ballot as an openly gay candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, there are the old standby heroes such as Charles
Lindbergh, Muhammad Ali, Mother Teresa, Anne Frank and America's
GIs.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  EYE-OPENER: When director Stanley Kubrick asked Frederic
Raphael to work with him on a script in 1994, the screenwriter for
``Darling'' and ``Two for the Road'' jumped at the chance.
Basically, Kubrick wanted to adapt an Austrian novel about a
devoted couple whose lives spin off into an erotic nightmare at a
masquerade ball in which they are separately propositioned.
Raphael, who describes his experiences with the temperamental
director in The New Yorker ($3), soon found himself in his own
nightmare. Kubrick wanted the script for ``Eyes Wide Shut'' to be
unmistakably his, and he wanted to move the action from
turn-of-the-century Vienna to contemporary New York. Hadn't many
things changed since then, Raphael asked, including relations
between men and women? ``Think so?'' Kubrick said. ``I don't think
so.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  SHAGADELIC: The publicity machine for ``The Spy Who Shagged
Me'' is cranked and running at full speed, with Mike Meyers gracing
the covers of Entertainment Weekly ($2.99) and GQ ($3) this week.
Not surprisingly, the Entertainment Weekly article is little more
than an unabashed plug for the film. The more balanced GQ profile
delves into Meyers' background as the son of an Encyclopaedia
Brittanica salesman who died tragically after being diagnosed with
Alzheimer's. The elder Meyers was a major influence on his son's
sense of humor, writes John Brodie. ``He loved ... Peter Sellers,
Beyond the Fringe, Monty Python and the early `Saturday Night
Live.'''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  COFFEE BREAK: Joe ($3), a magazine sold exclusively in
Starbucks stores, debuts June 16 with an impressive lineup of
articles, including a quirky essay by author Joy Williams about the
Unabomber's cabin. Produced under a joint agreement with Starbucks
and Time Inc., the magazine is slick and obviously aimed at a young
upscale audience. Much of the premiere issue takes an edgy look at
trust in human relationships. ``It is not a magazine about
coffee,'' says Starbucks Chairman Howard Schultz, ``but it is
certainly inspired by the idea of coffeehouse culture.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  JUNGLE JANE: Robyn Burnham leads a swinging life, literally,
as a paleobotanist whose specialty is studying vines of the South
American rain forest. In an intriguing profile in the second issue
of Women Outside ($3.95), Kent Black follows the 42-year-old
Burnham deep into Ecuador's heart of darkness in search of
medicinal plants.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  UNDER PRESSURE: Stress is a common complaint, but it's more
than an annoying byproduct of a frantic lifestyle. It can be a
killer, experts say in a Newsweek ($3.50) cover story. Scientists
acknowledge that living a stress-free life is not a realistic goal,
but there are ways to deal with tension. Suggested treatments
include meditation, massage, exercise and structured group support.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  QUICK READS: The readers of Jane ($2.95) voted the Rolling
Stones' ``No Security Tour'' as worst of 1999 in the magazine's
second annual entertainment poll. Second was Lilith Fair, followed
by the Spice Girls. ... Jezebel ($3.95) profiles superstar Shania
Twain and drag supermodel RuPaul in the June issue.

UNDATED: safety proposals. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Safety Board's in-depth investigations have clearly
demonstrated that fatigue is a major factor in transportation
accidents,'' the report says. ``Despite the many statements made by
the DOT about the importance of addressing fatigue in
transportation, only one of the three intermodal recommendations
issued to the DOT more than 10 years ago has been fully
implemented.''
</P>
<P>
   Setting a two-year time frame, NTSB officials went on to call
for research-based FAA regulations that set hours of service and
consider predictable ``human sleep and rest'' needs and circadian
rhythms.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is that accidents can be prevented by making sure
people are more alert during certain times of the day and working
so many hours,'' said Ted Lopatkiewicz, NTSB public affairs
representative.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, identifying fatigue as an accident factor is
difficult for investigators. Unlike drugs or alcohol, no one can be
chemically tested for exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators in Little Rock will be relying primarily on
circumstantial evidence, such as admissions of fatigue, co-workers'
testimony, recorded voice transmissions that indicate tiredness,
logging of long duty or flight hours, hours slept and circadian
patterns.
</P>
<P>
   Aviation watchers say myriad psychological factors could be at
work, including what Burnett calls ``get-there-itis,'' which
affects some pilots.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, ``You want to get the plane down and get home,''
Burnett said.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's what many believe is a common pilot mind-set.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pilots don't tend to say, `We're too fatigued,''' said David
Stempler, president of the Air Travelers Association in Washington.
``One of the great traits pilots have is their can-do spirit, that
they think they can accomplish anything. But that's also one of
their problems _ they could say, `Let's get to Little Rock
tonight.'''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to revise work-shift times have been stalemated almost
every step of the way by a lack of resolution among the FAA, pilots
associations and airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Fatigue factors began grabbing attention in Washington in 1989,
after the NTSB found several transportation accidents during that
decade were at least partially caused by fatigue. It urged the
industry to launch fatigue research programs, develop educational
materials and upgrade regulations.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, the NTSB placed ``operator fatigue'' on its list of
most wanted transportation safety improvements. It has stayed there
ever since.
</P>
<P>
   The only major change has been to bring noncommercial, or cargo,
planes under many of the same standards as commercial flights,
shortening some pilot duty and flight times in that industry.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, the FAA announced the formation of a rule-making
committee to tackle some of the fatigue issues and, a few years
later, came up with proposals that included minimum daily rest
periods of at least 10 hours and 36 consecutive hours of rest
within seven calendar days of duty. Those recommendations
languished. In 1996, another working group was formed and
established goals but couldn't decide how to meet them.
</P>
<P>
   Unions such as the Air Line Pilots Association, based in
Herndon, Va., lobbied for many changes but ran into opposition from
airlines and air-equipment manufacturers, their officials said.
They have pushed for tighter duty times, proposing 12-hour duty
times and greater rest periods for pilots and crews.
</P>
<P>
   ``The airlines have been opposed to it because they see it as
restricting their ability to schedule pilots,'' said Bob Flocke, a
spokesman for the Air Line Pilots Association.
</P>
<P>
   But Walt Coleman, president of the Regional Airline Association,
said airlines simply want regulations grounded in scientific
theory, not guesswork.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a serious issue in that there's a continuing
difference of opinion as to what some will say is a contributing
factor,'' Coleman said.
</P>
<P>
   He emphasized that pilots must meet their responsibilities ``to
be fit to fly'' and must acknowledge their fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   There's more to the debate than just caps on shifts.
</P>
<P>
   Other fatigue concerns include adequate rest time for reserve
pilots _ those who are ``on call'' for 24 hours over as many as
five days with no guaranteed rest periods _ and rest periods that
take into account commute times from pilots' homes.
</P>
<P>
   Only five carriers have schedules that permit crew rest while on
reserve status. American is not among them, said American Airlines
Capt. Rich Rubin, the Allied Pilots Association's expert on pilot
fatigue. The Allied Pilots represent American's 9,300 pilots.
</P>
<P>
   Stemper said that he believes that a tragedy tied to fatigue
unfortunately will have to be the motivating force in revising and
unifying work-shift limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a very complicated set of regulations, and that
makes it very hard for the guys in the business,'' Stemper said.
``Unfortunately, it's sort of a tombstone mentality at the FAA.
Until things get really bad, it doesn't get better.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, FAA chief Jane Garvey met Friday morning with a group
of pilots, including Rubin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been working quietly within the system for years to get
the FAA to take this important step to protect the ... public,''
said Rubin, a Miami-based 767 captain who chaired the FAA working
group on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said he believes that the maximum period for continuous
duty should be 12 hours. ``Fatigue is typically a factor of time on
task and time awake. When you're fatigued, you make mistakes.''

LITTLE ROCK CRASH RAISES ISSUE OF PILOT FATIGUE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MILES MOFFEIT 
and MARIA RECIO 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Aviation experts believe that it is a significant factor in many
airplane accidents. Federal safety board officials have
consistently ranked it among their ``most wanted safety
improvements.''
</P>
<P>
   It also happens to be a political hot potato that has been
tossed back and forth within the Federal Aviation Administration
since the early '90s.
</P>
<P>
   The subject: pilot fatigue and whether decades-old regulations
governing how long pilots work need to be overhauled.
</P>
<P>
   As investigators study the June 1 crash of American Airlines
Flight 1420, possible weariness in the cockpit is a focus of the
National Transportation Safety Board, which has pushed for FAA
policy revisions to reduce fatigue in transportation industries.
</P>
<P>
   Some aviation experts are troubled that American pilot Richard
Buschmann, who was killed in the crash, had logged 13 hours and 20
minutes. They wonder whether a powerful mix of fatigue and other
stresses contributed to Buschmann's decision to land despite
gale-force storms around Little Rock National Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Hours before the crash, the safety board released new safety
recommendations to the FAA, urging revisions to pilot work shifts
now capped at 16 hours and rebuking them for dragging their feet on
revisions since 1989. The NTSB report and the questions surrounding
the Little Rock crash have reopened the debate on pilot fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   Although FAA officials declined to comment on the NTSB report,
they said Friday that they would step up surveillance of the
flight/duty time rules and that air carriers must comply with
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA has never cited a carrier for failure to comply with
duty time rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're putting the airlines on notice that we're going to be
enforcing the existing regulation,'' FAA spokeswoman Diane
Spitaliere said.
</P>
<P>
   The new scrutiny is unrelated to the Little Rock crash, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Buschmann was well within federal standards, but his workload is
still viewed by some as too lengthy _ 7 1/2 hours of his shift
involved flying the plane.
</P>
<P>
   Former NTSB Chairman Jim Burnett, a safety consultant who
visited the Little Rock wreckage this week, said duty limits on
pilots should be re-examined. Current law restricts pilots of large
commercial planes to 16-hour shifts and no more than eight ``flight
hours'' on the shift. American Airlines' standard, stated in labor
contracts, is 14 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Burnett contends that those limits are lax.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked 14 hours yesterday, but what I do is not critical to
human lives the way pilots' jobs are,'' Burnett said. ``The last
act of every pilot's workday is landing the airplane. That act may
become routine, but at the end of a 14-hour workday, judgment calls
may not be alert enough to be made.''
</P>
<P>
   Other aviation experts caution against drawing quick conclusions
based on the Little Rock crash.
</P>
<P>
   Although pilot fatigue has been viewed as a factor in crashes
involving planes flying for at least 20 small U.S. air carriers,
including cargo companies, in the last 20 years, according to NTSB
records, fatigue findings have been rarer in major airline
disasters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an important issue, but a slippery issue,'' said Mike
Overly, editor of the Aviation Safety Monitor based in Ohio. ``It's
just very difficult to pin down. It seems you might be able to look
at the duty hours and say they're too close (to the limit), but you
don't know actually what transpired.''
</P>
<P>
   American Airlines is not releasing recent work schedules of the
Flight 1420 cockpit crew. Nor are company officials commenting on
whether exhaustion could have been a factor. But airline spokesman
Tim Smith said the pilots were within allowable work-shift limits
set by union contracts and federal law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both pilots had been off for several days prior to the
accident,'' Smith said, stressing that most of American's work
limits are tougher than federal guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   NTSB investigators acknowledged that they would be studying
possible fatigue factors in examining the crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have recovered recorders and the tower transmissions. From
here we will go into understanding what the pilots were trying to
do,'' said George Black, an NTSB spokesman, adding that the
circadian rhythms of the crew would be examined.
</P>
<P>
   Circadian rhythms are a hot topic among NASA researchers who
have developed fatigue countermeasure programs. They believe flight
duties should, whenever possible, be scheduled to conform with
natural body rhythms, which cause most people to function more
alertly in late morning and early evening hours. They also
recommend that work shifts should be scheduled to ensure that crew
members stay alert.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   The new safety recommendations issued by NTSB officials June 1
urge the Federal Aviation Administration to establish
scientifically based standards for addressing crew fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   Although it praised some agencies for making headway in
fatigue-education programs, the safety report sharply criticized
the U.S. Department of Transportation and the FAA for not
addressing many NTSB safety proposals.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Oppressive heat and humidity will continue for one more day
across the Northeast before a cool front slowly sags southward into
the region. Areas from southern New England to Virginia will see
temperatures soaring into the '90s as well as very high humidities
to make it feel as if it is near 110 degrees in many locations.
</P>
<P>
   A cool front stretching from northern New England to the upper
Great Lakes will spark a line of fast moving, strong thunderstorms
over northern New York, Vermont and New Hampshire. The passage of
the front in the upper Great Lakes will be more benign as only a
few showers are expected.
</P>
<P>
   A ridge of high pressure off the Carolina coast will keep much
of the southern Atlantic states under mostly sunny skies and very
warm temperatures. Meanwhile, a weak disturbance aloft will trigger
more showers and thunderstorms from Florida to Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   Aided by a warm, moist flow from the Gulf of Mexico,
thunderstorms will erupt in the central Great Plains. A low
pressure system moving out of the Rockies will initiate a few more
showers and perhaps a rumble of thunder over the Dakotas. Behind
this storm, much of Montana will once again see periods of rain and
drizzle as well as temperatures struggling to reach the upper 50s.
</P>
<P>
   Showers will inundate the Pacific Northwest as cool, moist air
from the Pacific is forced up the coastal ranges. Sunny skies will
prevail across the Southwest, except on the immediate Southern
California coastline where a persistent marine layer will slowly
dissipate throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Heat Index
</P>
<P>
   Parts of the Northeast have been under a heat warning for Monday
and Tuesday. A heat warning is usually issued when the heat index
is forecasted to rise above 100 degrees on consecutive days. The
heat index, a warm season analog to wind chill, is an attempt to
quantify the effects on humans of the combination of warmth and
high humidity. When the air has a high moisture content, cooling by
evaporation from the skin is reduced and the stress on the human
body is increased. However, the heat index does not account for
variables like wind or sunshine, which can contribute to heat
stress.

 &HT;    IBM: MICROSOFT BROKE THE ANTITRUST LAWS
 &HT;    460&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For the first time in the Microsoft trial, a
federal court heard a corporate witness provide clear evidence
Monday that the software giant had broken the nation's antitrust
laws.
</P>
<P>
   The detailed accusations came from Garry Norris, a mid-level IBM
Corp. manager.
</P>
<P>
   He testified that Microsoft refused to renew IBM's licenses for
Windows at a competitive price because IBM would not agree to stop
selling computers loaded with its competing OS/2 operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Nor would Microsoft tolerate IBM's resolve to market its Lotus
Smart Suite, an all-inclusive business product in competition with
Microsoft Office, Norris said.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, IBM did obtain a Windows 95 license. But, Norris
charged, Microsoft charged an inflated royalty, and it agreed to
sign only 15 minutes before Windows 95 went on public sale in 1995.
That, in itself, cost IBM millions of dollars in lost revenue
because the company was unable to preload the operating system on
its machines prior to the rollout.
</P>
<P>
   Norris quoted Mark Baber, a former Microsoft executive who
negotiated with IBM during the period, as telling him: ``This is
the only game in town. Where else are you going to go?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was crystal clear to us that there was no viable commercial
alternative,'' said Norris, who kept a detailed journal of his
troubled negotiations with Microsoft officials.
</P>
<P>
   Norris served a crucial witness for the government after none of
the nation's major computer makers proved willing to support the
government's claims that Microsoft uses the prices for its dominant
Windows operating system to penalize enemies and reward allies.
</P>
<P>
   Even at that, the Justice Department was obliged to issue
subpoenas to compel Norris to testify and for IBM to produce a
welter of purportedly incriminating documents. Once he took the
witness stand, however, Norris became a highly cooperative witness
for the prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Summarizing outside the courtroom what he viewed as the
``devastating impact'' of Norris's testimony, David Boies, the
government's lead lawyer, said, ``When you have monopoly power, the
law says you are clearly not free to go out and try to induce
people not to compete. Agreements not to compete are fundamentally
inconsistent with the free market system and the anti-trust laws.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Murray, a Microsoft spokesman, said the ``government had
presented a selective and one-sided narrative of the complex
business relationship'' between the two large firms. It will be
corrected when Norris is cross-examined, probably on Tuesday,
Murray predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, Microsoft President Steve Ballmer said in a CNBC
interview that ``we didn't try to push out OS/2 in any sense in the
negotiations we had with IBM.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   On the witness stand, Norris recalled that Microsoft Chairman
Bill Gates became so angry over IBM's defiance on the software
issue that the multibillionaire screamed at Norris's boss during a
phone call a July 1995 while Norris stood nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was pretty loud,'' Norris said, eliciting nervous laughter
in the crowded courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Norris worked for an IBM division based in Raleigh,
N.C., that produced a line of personal computers closely mated to a
``family'' of Microsoft software. Meantime, another IBM division
based in Austin, Tex., was marketing both OS/2 and Windows versions
of Lotus Smart Suite.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because we were competing, we were suffering,'' Norris said.
``They were a liability to the IBM PC company.''
</P>
<P>
   Norris, frustrated by his inability to strike what he viewed as
fair agreements with Microsoft in 1995 and 1996, testified that IBM
saw the total fees it paid to Microsoft rise from $40 million in
1996 to $440 million last year as a result of its stance.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who will rule in
the antitrust trial later this year, took frequent notes,
occasionally asked clarifying questions and closely studied e-mails
and other documents projected on a 10-foot screen in the courtroom.

   KOSOVO-RDP (Bonn, Germany) _ Ledeall. Daylong talks among
foreign ministers of the United States, six other Western nations
and Russia broke up Monday without Moscow's agreement on tough NATO
peace terms for Kosovo that are laid out in a draft U.N. Security
Council resolution. Developing. By Jane Perlez.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-ALBANIA (Kukes, Albania) _ When he heard the news of a
peace deal between NATO and the Yugoslav government last week _ a
deal that might send him back home after two months as a refugee _
Ismet Memaj reacted by celebrating. ``I drank all day,'' said
Memaj, a 52-year-old construction worker. ``It's true. I was so
happy.'' By Ian Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-NATO (Brussels, Belgium) _ NATO held back most of Monday
on carrying out threats to intensify its bombing of Yugoslavia if
Belgrade did not promptly accept allied terms on Kosovo. Allied
officials said they hoped that the restraint would help persuade
Russia to back a U.N. Security Council resolution on ending the
crisis. By Craig R. Whitney.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-REFUGEES (Jazince, Macedonia) _ Macedonian government
officials Monday said over thirty rounds were fired into this
border village by Yugoslav forces Sunday night from inside Kosovo.
The attack was the most serious eruption of violence along the
Kosovo-Macedonia border since NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia began in
late March. What motivated the attack was not clear, but they
illustrated both the ability of Yugoslav forces to destabilize the
border area and the continuing operations of the Kosovo Liberation
Army in Macedonia. By David Rohde.

   KOSOVO-SERBIA (Krnjaca, Serbia) _ For five years they have
lived, four adults in a single room, in this drab compound of
makeshift huts on the outskirts of Belgrade. The Sehovac family,
Serbs who fled Sarajevo in 1994, are sunk in a world of depression
and bitterness. By Carlotta Gall.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-MACEDONIA (Skopje, Macedonia) _ The military talks
intended to seal the withdrawal of Serbian forces from Kosovo fell
apart over the weekend when Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
realized that this technical military agreement would become the
legal basis for the Kosovo peacekeeping forces, rather than a U.N.
referendum, which he believed had been agreed to in the peace
settlement reached last week, according to NATO and senior Western
diplomats. By Elizabeth Becker.

AN AMBITIOUS END TO A CROSS-COUNTRY COLLABORATION 
</HEADLINE>
   By KENNETH BAKER  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. &LR;   &LR; _ ``Surroundings: Responses to the American
Landscape,'' which opened Sunday at the San Jose Museum of Art,
culminates a four-year program of loan exhibitions from New York's
Whitney Museum of American Art. The four yearlong shows have drawn
a thematic survey from New York's greatest public collection of
20th century American art.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the last installment is neither climactic nor conclusive. It
portrays the century's end as a moment of artistic confusion,
marked by clashing ideas of art's social relevance.
``Surroundings'' leaves us wondering not only which of the works in
the exhibition future audiences might consider 20th century
classics, but also whether the idea of classic artworks will even
have a future.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at certain things in the show for the first time, such
as Keith Sonnier's glass and neon ``Ba-O-Ba, Number 3'' (1969) or
Alan Saret's tangle of wire, ``Mount Tai'' (1987), it is easy to
forget that landscape is the unifying thread of ``Surroundings.''
</P>
<P>
   The show's curators, Beth Venn of the Whitney and Cathy Kimball
of the San Jose museum, make a brave attempt to expand the
visitor's thinking beyond the traditional scope of landscape
imagery in painting.
</P>
<P>
   It may take several passes through the exhibition to notice some
of the less obvious linkages. For example, Sonnier's neon piece and
Edward Hopper's ``Railroad Sunset'' (1929) appear very different in
form and sensibility. Yet the play of color in them is startlingly
similar, almost as if Sonnier's work were an abstraction of
Hopper's.
</P>
<P>
   Noticing their chromatic rhyming, one might start to relate
Sonnier's work to neon street signs and thus to the emotional
desolation of the urban landscape, the subject of so many Hopper
paintings.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, were Sonnier's piece to be encountered in
another context _ say in San Jose's last Whitney show,
``Alternating Currents: American Art in the Age of Technology'' _
it might never be related to landscape at all.
</P>
<P>
   Too many of the affinities in ``Surroundings'' seem cleverly,
but superficially, contrived. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  For example, it is exciting to see Alex Katz's ``Dark
Reflections'' (1995) _ an unusually fine picture by an overrated
painter _ alongside Christopher Wilmarth's glass and steel
sculpture ``Clearing No. 1 of Nine Clearings for a Standing Man''
(1973). &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  The Katz, a nearly abstract image of a tree reflection in a
lake's surface by night, exudes a thin, gray-green light like that
which diffuses through the upright panel of green frosted glass in
Wilmarth's sculpture. Behind the glass the edges of a folded sheet
of steel soften and vanish as they recede, as though disappearing
into mist.
</P>
<P>
   The Wilmarth may be concerned with sensations of closeness and
distance, but to think of it as landscape sculpture is to take its
title too literally and shut down its mystery.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of works among the 59 pieces that fall readily
under the show's subtitle, ``Responses to the American Landscape.''
But for every Charles Burchfield, Georgia O'Keeffe or Marsden
Hartley, there is something such as George Sugarman's meandering
painted wood sculpture ``Inscape'' (1964) _ a satisfying, seldom
exhibited work _ or Louise Nevelson's ``Rain Forest Columns,''
which seem to be included more because of their titles than for
what they are.
</P>
<P>
   And there are some curious omissions. Robert Morris and Michael
Heizer are represented by drawings, so where is Robert Smithson?
</P>
<P>
   The show tightens up again in the last room, where the line
between social and natural landscape is blurred not by the curators
but by the artworks themselves.
</P>
<P>
   A drawing for Christo's colossal 1976 ``Running Fence,'' a
project that still lives in local memory, reminds us how powerfully
social and aesthetic dimensions can converge in artworks done on
the land. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Roger Brown's painting-with-diorama ``XXX Exxon'' (1989), on
the other hand, responds to the Exxon Valdez disaster so
heavy-handedly that its outrage is laughable.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps mindful that ``Surroundings'' was their last shot,
curators Venn and Kimball have tried to do too much, to blur too
many categories, call too much into question at once. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Still, the San Jose/Whitney program has been a success
overall.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, San Jose director Josi Callan struck a deal for a
series of long-term loans from the Whitney's permanent collection
with David Ross, then the Whitney's director. In June 1998, Ross
became director of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.
</P>
<P>
   Because San Jose has a small permanent collection, the idea was
to use the Whitney's resources to lay a foundation for future
programming. Each show has lasted a year, giving the South Bay art
public plenty of time to revisit it and see it play off against
other, more transient museum events.
</P>
<P>
   How much educational staying power the San Jose/Whitney
partnership will have remains to be seen. But the value of the
program during its run is beyond question. It argues for a home
truth about art: that there is no substitute _ high-tech or
otherwise _ for eyes-on confrontation with art objects themselves,
especially those considered canonical.
</P>
<P>
   We can only hope that other museums around the country take note
of San Jose's initiative and follow its example.

 &HT;    Email over the cell phone? Soon, Southern LINC says
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Southern LINC said Tuesday it plans to offer its
customers the ability to send and receive E-mail from their
wireless phone.
</P>
<P>
   The features, expected to be available by fall, include using
your cellular phone screen as a small Web browser, access to
bookmarked Web sites to check stock prices, weather conditions or
any other text-based information available on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The new features will be available to Southern LINC's customers
in its six-state coverage area. The company has not said how much
it would cost.
</P>
<P>
   Southern LINC is the telecommunications division of Southern
Company, a regional utility company based in Atlanta. The company
has more than 100,000 customers.
</P>
<P>
   Southern LINC's digital wireless coverage area includes part of
southeastern Mississippi, including Biloxi, Hattiesburg and
Meridian; most of Alabama and Georgia, sections of north Florida,
including Pensacola and Panama City, and smaller bits of southern
Tennessee and western South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   The company's product is a blend of two-way radio and cell
phone: It gives one-button access to one person or a group, or
traditional cellular phone service or paging, which transmits
numbers or words.
</P>
<P>
   The new features add a Web browser, e-mail and fax capabilities
to the wireless phone. The small Web browser can display up to 6
lines and 16 characters at one time. Users can edit which e-mails
are forwarded to their wireless phone. Replies are typed in, using
the phone's number pad and a predictive speller technology.
</P>
<P>
   The company initially targeted businesses with a mobile
workforce but has been adding traditional business customers, said
Robert G. Dawson, Southern LINC's chief executive.

 &HT;    Supercomm99 to showcase merger of mediums, ADSL standardBy
Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Convergence of the telephone, other telecommunication
devices and the PC is the hot topic at this year's Supercomm99
going on now through Thursday at the Georgia World Congress Center.
</P>
<P>
   Billing itself as the Number One communications industry event,
Supercomm has more than 700 exhibitors and plenty of flash and
glitz to promote the latest products and services for what is now a
very hot part of the technology industry.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 46,000 attendees walked the floors of last year's
conference, and an equal, if not larger number of industry
professionals, analysts and entrepreneurs are expected to attend
this year. High on this year's agenda is the deployment of
high-speed Digital Subscriber Line telephone access to the
Internet, fiber optics and ``last-mile'' access from the
telecommunications provider to the consumer.
</P>
<P>
   The Supercomm exhibitors and panels are focused on products and
technologies that can speed the process of bringing ``always on''
Internet access to home Net users. Most major telecommunications
companies including BellSouth, BellAtlantic, SBC and others are
beginning to deploy high-speed Internet service, but getting that
service to every telephone customer has been rough going for a
variety of technical reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Also topping the agenda is the adoption next month of the
Universal ADSL standard, a type of modem jointly developed by
telecommunications and computer companies that facilitates the
installation and use of high speed Internet access service.
</P>
<P>
   One lesson the conference learned from last year is that a
number of analysts, brokers, venture capitalists and others come
trying to find ``the next big thing'' in telecommunications. To
accommodate this audience segment, Supercomm will offer financial
presentations by communications companies.
</P>
<P>
   Along with traditional telecommunications companies, there is
also an increasing number of start-up companies looking to find a
niche in a rapidly expanding sector. Highlighting the diversity of
this year's Supercomm is this year's keynote address from Microsoft
president Steve Ballmer, who is expected to discuss how the
software giant plans to establish its presence in the broadband
arena.

 &HT;    Stanley Cup Finals at a glance
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Buffalo Sabres vs. Dallas Stars
</P>
<P>
   _ Resumes: Buffalo went 37-28-18 during the regular season and
eliminated Ottawa (4-0), Boston (4-2) and Toronto (4-1) in the
Eastern Conference playoffs. Dallas went 51-19-12 during the
regular season and eliminated Edmonton (4-0), St. Louis (4-3) and
Colorado (4-3) in the Western Conference.
</P>
<P>
   _ Head to head: Each team won at home in two regular-season
meetings. The Stars won 4-1 Oct. 10, scoring three power-play goals
against Dominik Hasek. Buffalo won 2-1 on March 5 behind rookie
goalie Martin Biron when Hasek was injured.
</P>
<P>
   _ Final exams: Neither franchise has won a Cup. The Sabres lost
to Philadelphia 4-2 in 1974-75. The Stars lost twice when based in
Minnesota, 4-1 to the New York Islanders in 1980-81 and 4-2 to
Pittsburgh in 1990-91.
</P>
<P>
   _ Numbers: Hasek (11-2, 1.82 goals-against, .938 saves pct.) has
been typically impressive, but he has had to be a one-man team of
late. Offensively, the Sabres have been led in the playoffs by
Curtis Brown (7-5-12), Dixon Ward (6-5-11), Michael Peca (4-8-12)
and Jason Wooley (3-10-13). Miroslav Satan (40 goals regular
season) recently returned from an ankle injury. For Dallas, Joe
Nieuwendyk (9-9-18) has been unstoppable and remains the best
face-off man in the league. Just behind are Mike Modano (5-11-16),
Jamie Langenbrunner (9-5-14) and Brett Hull (5-7-12). Ed Belfour's
numbers (12-5, 1.83, .927) rival Hasek's.
</P>
<P>
   _ How Dallas can win: The Stars are deeper and more experienced,
and they excel in positional, reactive hockey. If the Stars force
the Sabres' speedy wingers to the outside and limit rebound
attempts against goalie Ed Belfour, they have the ability to sweep
this series. Dallas' power play has struggled in the playoffs (12.3
percent) but has successfully killed 88.7 percent of its penalties.
</P>
<P>
   _ How Buffalo can win: The Sabres need to exploit their two best
weapons: Hasek and speed. If the world's best goalie can keep
Dallas in check, the Stars might wear down. They are a relatively
old team and have played consecutive seven-game series. Buffalo has
been off for 10 days and creates scoring chances off its speed. The
Sabres also have become a more aggressive offensive team as the
playoffs have gone on.
</P>
<P>
   _ Prediction: Dallas in six.

 &HT;    NHL Notes: Expansion team begins search for coach
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ While two teams prepare to play for a Stanley Cup, the
general manager of the Atlanta Thrashers takes his coaching search
to a new level today.
</P>
<P>
   Don Waddell will interview former Phoenix coach Don Hay today
for Atlanta's head-coaching vacancy. Hay becomes the first
candidate brought to Atlanta to get past the
informal-interview-and-lunch level. Hay, a long-time successful
coach in the Canadian juniors, coaches Tri-City in the Western
League.
</P>
<P>
   A new name is on the Thrashers' list of candidates: Ron Low. Low
resigned as Edmonton coach late Sunday after refusing a one-year
extension without a raise from his salary of $325,000, which was
the second-lowest among league coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably should talk to him,'' said Waddell, who has been
doing background checks on Low and several other potential
candidates. ``He did a good job in Edmonton.''
</P>
<P>
   Waddell would not say if he would bring Low to Atlanta for a
formal interview. The GM also has had preliminary meetings with
former Buffalo coach Ted Nolan and Ottawa assistant Mike Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   Low coached the financially strapped Oilers for five seasons,
the second longest tenure in the league to Scotty Bowman's six with
Detroit. His cumulative record is 106-125-28, including 33-37-12
this year and three playoff appearances in a row, but the Oilers
never made it past the second round. Low's contract expired June 1,
and Edmonton GM Glen Sather offered only the one-year deal.
Assistant Kevin Lowe is expected to be named his replacement.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, neither Buffalo assistant coach Don Lever nor Dallas
assistants Doug Jarvis or Rick Wilson, all possible Atlanta
candidates, have been contacted. Lever said Monday that he got in
touch with Thrashers assistant GM Les Jackson during the season.
``I'm hoping to hear from them when we get done with the
playoffs,'' said Lever, who played for the Atlanta Flames for four
months. ``I'd like to have a crack at it.''
</P>
<P>
   No underdog
</P>
<P>
   Dallas coach Ken Hitchcock said his team has no reason to
underrate Buffalo. ``They were a seven seed (in the East) only
because they had injuries,'' Hitchcock said. ``They were a one or
two seed around Christmas, but injuries pushed them down. After
they swept Ottawa in the first round, you could see this was a
legitimate hockey team. When we lost to them in Buffalo this year,
our players left the game feeling that New Jersey and Buffalo were
the two best teams we had faced.''
</P>
<P>
   Slush update
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo coach Lindy Ruff didn't expect the ice in Reunion Arena
to be very good _ and his fears were realized. ``It's good for
about the first five or 10 minutes, then it's a problem,'' Ruff
said. ``It will hinder us because we're a skating team but we'll
have to adjust to it.

TELEVISION REVIEW: THE ISSUE OF FREE SPEECH, THE VOICE OF BIG
MONEY
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. Time, channel are
for New York area. Check local listings.) 
(ms) 
 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bill Moyers begins ``Free Speech for Sale,'' Tuesday
night's vigorous assault on the power of moneyed interests in
American politics, with the story of Cindy Watson, a Republican
member of the North Carolina General Assembly who took on the
state's hog farmers. When her constituents complained about the
odors of hog waste and its effect on drinking water, she pushed for
restrictions on the growth of hog farms, the state's biggest
agricultural industry, until they cleaned up their act.
</P>
<P>
   Well, in the next election, Ms. Watson was cleaned away with a
big-money television blitz by a group calling itself Farmers for
Fairness, a euphemism for the hog growers. As long as such front
groups avoid the words ``vote for'' or ``vote against,'' they are
not regulated by campaign finance laws. Thus, by courtesy of a much
criticized Supreme Court ruling, special interests have been
granted the rights of free speech once reserved for individuals,
insuring that plenty of money is available to enhance corporate
welfare.
</P>
<P>
   Moyers' report, which echoes the arguments of advocates for
tougher rules on campaign spending, confirms that the hoggish
pursuit of power is not confined to the hog business.
</P>
<P>
   Take the cigarette companies. In their 1998 fight to defeat the
popular McCain bill, which would have held the tobacco industry
accountable for the deleterious health effects of smoking, big
tobacco spent a record $40 million on what Moyers calls ``salvo
after salvo of half-truths and distortions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Free Speech for Sale'' offers little hope that television news
can be depended on to cover touchy issues. Critics of the 1996
Telecommunications Act, which is described Tuesday night as a
giveaway to media heavyweights, report that in nine months of
debate the three major networks' evening news programs carried only
19 minutes on an act that meant billions for their bosses. The
crucial question of whether broadcasters should be made to pay for
control of the new digital spectrum, which promises to bring them
fresh fortunes, went largely ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Lewis of the Center for Public Integrity, who keeps an
eye on big-money propaganda, says that for the networks to have
covered the digital spectrum issue ``would be like a bank robber
stopping the bank robbery and saying: `Look at what we're doing
here. Let's have a press conference in front of the bank while
we're doing it.'''
</P>
<P>
   With media conglomerates being steadily engorged through mergers
and consolidations, the prospect of news departments' taking on
their own industries becomes ever dimmer. The message of ``Free
Speech for Sale'' is that speech has become an expensive commodity
that only the very wealthy can afford and can be counted on to use
to drown out less powerful voices.

<P>
   In any accounting of the most important people in the performing
arts this century, Luis Bunuel and Peter Brook would figure
prominently. Because he is far less well known, Jean-Claude
Carriere would probably not make the list. But he is the primary
writer behind the vastly different directors: Bunuel, the creator
of dreamlike reveries on eroticism and society; Brook, the ensemble
explorer of cultural myths.
</P>
<P>
   It is with Carriere that the directors have had their longest
and most rewarding creative relationship. By his own description,
he is ``a transmitter'' who has chosen to spend most of his life as
a conduit for the visions of other artists, as, in effect, a
servant of two masters.
</P>
<P>
   Carriere, who is French and lives in Paris, wrote six of
Bunuel's most memorable films, including ``Belle de Jour'' and
``Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie.'' Over 25 years, he also did
the adaptations for Brook's stage productions of ``The Conference
of the Birds,'' ``The Tragedy of Carmen'' and ``The Mahabarata,''
among others.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, explaining his relationship with Carriere, Bunuel
said, ``I give my ideas and we discuss them and then he writes for
me.'' The director wanted an instant reaction, and each had a right
of veto. During a recent visit to New York, Carriere said, ``I had
to help him find what he really wanted to do.''
</P>
<P>
   In his memoir, ``Threads of Time,'' Brook wrote about their
decade of work together on ``The Mahabarata.'' Carriere, he said,
was ``never satisfied, always open to criticism, untiring, never
short of ideas, writing all the time.'' He added, ``I cannot
imagine a better collaborator.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the adaptable Carriere was the writer or one of the
writers for the films ``Danton,'' ``The Return of Martin Guerre,''
``The Tin Drum'' and ``The Unbearable Lightness of Being.''
</P>
<P>
   There is another, more personal aspect to his career. He has
written four original plays, the latest of which, ``La Terrasse,''
is in previews and is scheduled to open Tuesday night at the
Manhattan Theater Club. In New York briefly for that production,
Carriere talked about his play and his collaborative techniques.
The idea for his new play had been fermenting for 30 years, ever
since he and Milos Forman were working on a screenplay in an
apartment in Paris. A real estate agent arrived with a prospective
tenant. Carriere thought that would be an interesting way for
characters to meet.
</P>
<P>
   When he finally wrote ``La Terrasse'' several years ago, it
became a comedy about diverse people who come together in an
apartment suddenly on the market. A stranger inspects the rooms at
the same time that the couple living there are breaking up. The
intrusive visitor begins making demands. Soon he is in the kitchen
fixing a late lunch. Later he decides to take a nap. As other
characters enter, slamming doors and jumping off the apartment's
terrace, the play evokes the feeling of a classic French farce with
a touch of Ionesco. The playwright freely acknowledged the
influences while adding that the writing was also intuitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dream of a writer is to be surprised by his characters,''
he said. ``All of a sudden, they are living their own lives; they
are not prisoners anymore.'' In this case, he has an adapter, Mark
O'Donnell, who did the English-language version of the play. It is
directed by Mike Ockrent.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting on his career, Carriere, a large, bearded and
effusive man, said it was a natural progression for him to become a
writer and an adapter of the works of others. He was born 67 years
ago in Colombieres sur Orb. At first he had considered teaching
history, but then he wrote a novel. From there, it was a sidestep
into films, in which he always had a major interest.
</P>
<P>
   Carriere gave full credit to his directors for their
inspiration. As he once said, ``My collaborators oblige me to
think.'' He met Bunuel in 1963 when he was one of many candidates
to write the screenplay for Bunuel's ``Diary of a Chambermaid.'' At
their first meeting at a hotel in the south of France, the director
asked Carriere if he drank wine. He answered that not only did he
drink wine, but that his family owned a vineyard. Apparently that
was the right answer. It endeared him to the director, who
immediately began what turned into a 20-year working relationship.
</P>
<P>
   During that time, Carriere also wrote Bunuel's autobiography,
``My Last Breath,'' one of many signs of his power of mimicry. When
Bunuel read a sample chapter, he said: ``This is very strange. I
have a feeling I have written this.'' Carriere took that as a very
high compliment.
</P>
<P>
   Bunuel's effect on him was so strong, Carriere said, that 16
years after the director's death there is ``no one day in my life
that I do not pass some time with him.'' He added, ``He helps me
now not only in my work but in my life.'' He was absolutely
faithful to his principles. ``He said what he would not do for one
dollar he would not do for one million dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   Comparing the two directors, Carriere reached for metaphors:
``Peter is a brook, like clear water going from one ground to
another one, bringing fertility. Bunuel was a block of Spanish
stone. You have to dig inside to find if there is some corner of
the stone which has not been explored yet.''
</P>
<P>
   With Bunuel, the work was all done privately between the
director and the writer. With Brook, Carriere became a member of
the director's company, even exercising with the actors. He was
responsible for the text and he was expected to be able to explain
the dramatic movement to the actors.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no neat separation between the writing and the
directing,'' he said. ``If I need Peter _ and very often I need him
when we are translating Shakespeare because he knows Shakespeare
better than anybody in the world _ he is with me, on my shoulder.
And when we go from the writing to the directing, I am with him.''

&HT;        PA SENATORS REACT TO KOSOVO PEACE AGREEMENT
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Mary M. Shaffrey  
 &HT;    c. 1999 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, June 7 - The peace agreement reached last week
between Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic and the international
community has fallen apart, but Pennsylvania's senators still want
the issue addressed and are not backing down from their original
positions.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Arlen Specter (R) sent a letter to President Clinton last
Thursday urging him to make sure any peace agreement reached would
include the extradition of President Milosovic.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have a peace settlement that leaves Milosevic as
President of Yugoslavia, we invite his initiating future wars...and
we allow him to get away with murder because we acknowledge his
bargaining power,'' Specter said in the letter.
</P>
<P>
   He also went on to say Secretary of State Madeline Albright has
recognized the threat of keeping Milosevic in power, because his
history of starting four wars in the past indicates he will start
another war in the future.
</P>
<P>
   John Ullyot, a spokesman for Specter, said it was too premature
to comment on the status of the peace talks, but that Specter is
``anxious to see that Milosevic is brought to trial at The Hague
(Netherlands) for his war crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Traynham, Press Secretary for Sen. Rick Santorum (R) said
that Santorum shares the same concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are still unanswered questions, specifically how do you
treat Slobodan Milosevic and who is going to pay for everything,''
said Traynham.
</P>
<P>
   Pennsylvania residents' calls into Santorum's office have been
mixed, but people are getting their thoughts across.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of them are calling and saying that we shouldn't be over
there in the first place and say this recent action is just the
proof in the pudding,'' Trayhnam said.
</P>
<P>
   Specter's office has not received that many calls, said Ullyot.
But according to the www.senatevotes.com site, where constituents
can post e-mail messages for their senators, Specter is getting an
earfull.
</P>
<P>
   ``Didn't we learn anything from Viet Nam? Haven't we learned to
stay out of others Civil Wars?'' asked Paul Cruce. Cruce went on to
say that President Clinton was using this war to divert attention
from ``Chinagate,'' and he urged Specter to ``Quit being the
Demoncraps accessories to the crime.''
</P>
<P>
   The peace talks broke down over the weekend when Serbian
military leaders rejected the terms of the agreement reached last
week. Milosevic stated today that he is committed to peace in the
area, but there is still disagreement over when the Serbian troops
will leave Kosovo and what role Russia will play in the
peacekeeping operation. Talks are scheduled to resume tomorrow.

 UNDATED: with him.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Each was the most demanding of directors, he said: ``You can't
work with them with your hands in your pockets. You have to prepare
and concentrate. It's like going in the finals of the Olympic
games. If you are distracted, they will feel it immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Carriere has never been interested in directing, he has
occasionally acted. For Bunuel, he played a priest in ``Diary of a
Chambermaid'' and a bishop in ``The Milky Way.'' He recalled that
the director told him, ``You are a very good actor, but only for a
priest.'' Once he played the role of a veterinarian in a movie for
another filmmaker. After the film was shown to Bunuel, Carriere
asked him what he thought of his acting. He said, ``You are very
good, but only for priests _ and veterinarians.'' Carriere
commented, ``My field was enlarging.''
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of his career, Carriere worked with another
celebrated movie artist, Jacques Tati. Because he had written a
novel, he was asked to write novelizations of Tati's films ``Mr.
Hulot's Holiday'' and ``My Uncle.'' At their first meeting, Tati
asked him what he knew about filmmaking. Carriere answered, ``Very
little,'' and Tati assigned one of his film editors to give him a
quick course. Carriere recalled that the editor put the script of
`` Hulot'' on a table next to the first reel of the film. ``She
told me that the only problem is to go from this to this. You have
to change from one language to another. It's like alchemy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tati taught me how to observe,'' Carriere continued, ``how to
sit in a cafe in Paris and to look at the passersby and to guess
what their story is, even a little moment of their story, a comic
effect. Tati supposed that the world had been created by God in
order to lead to a comic film.''
</P>
<P>
   Explaining how he is able to work with so many disparate
directors with distinct points of view, he said, ``The quality of
the work is the same.'' Realistically, he added, ``It doesn't work
every time. It depends on the director and on the story. My real
collaborations are always very long.''
</P>
<P>
   Each is a hand-tailored project, and for its duration it is a
preoccupation, in which Carriere acts as scholarly investigator as
well as adapter.
</P>
<P>
   His interests, on and off screen, are wide, from art to
astrophysics. One of his recent projects is a book about science
written without using scientific language. As he said, ``Nobody
should be excluded from knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he has occasionally worked with French directors like
Louis Malle and Jean-Luc Godard, generally Carriere's collaborators
have been foreign, and he has often undertaken non-French subjects.
``I've never written what can be called a Parisian film or play,''
he said. ``When I work on my own French culture, I like to do it
with Bunuel or Andrzej Wajda, who can look from outside.'' For
Wajda, he wrote ``Danton,'' about the French Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``In `Discreet Charm,' Bunuel's look is unique,'' he said. ``No
French director would show the French bourgeoisie the way he did.''
Bunuel described the film as illogical and irrational. Strange
things occur during an interrupted dinner. At one point, the French
army stops by while on maneuvers.
</P>
<P>
   Carriere added that his initial distance from ``The Mahabarata''
and ``The Conference of the Birds'' enhanced his work on those
plays. With equal agility, he was one of the screenwriters of
Volker Schloendorff's film of ``The Tin Drum,'' Guenter Grass'
novel about Germany in the first half of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   Asked which of his many films best represented him, Carriere
said: ``That's the only question I never ask myself. Louis Malle
once told me, `You are very lucky, you have no ego.' I don't know
if that's true, but I don't feel I have a message to deliver. If I
am somewhere, I am in this scattered curiosity.''

 &HT;    Charter closing controversial hospitals
 &HT;    By Andy Miller
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Alpharetta, Ga.-based Charter Behavioral Health
Systems is closing a Charlotte, N.C. facility featured in a CBS
News program that alleged problems in the psychiatric hospital
chain.
</P>
<P>
   Charter Pines in Charlotte will close due to care issues
determined during an internal company investigation, Charter said
Monday. Charter, a private company, also will shut psychiatric
services at a second hospital, in Largo, Fla., merging those
operations with its Tampa facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Charter's chief executive officer said Monday the closures will
occur for several reasons, and not because of the ``60 Minutes II''
report.
</P>
<P>
   But the month-old company probe followed the ``60 Minutes II''
report, anchored by Ed Bradley and aired in April, that alleged
patient care problems, including injuries and two deaths, at
Charter facilities. In the program, a social worker, employed for
eight weeks at the Charlotte hospital, wore a hidden camera to
detail conditions there. The CBS News report alleged unsafe
conditions, falsification of medical records, and lack of employee
training at Charter facilities.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the hospital closings, Charter CEO Mike French
said, ``These were facilities where we needed to take immediate
action.''
</P>
<P>
   French, who took over as Charter president and CEO last October,
added that he didn't anticipate other closings, but didn't rule out
such action.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make it absolutely clear to the communities we
serve that we will be in compliance with established industry and
company standards, or we will take swift and immediate action,''
French said, insisting that overall, Charter hospitals maintain
good relationships with local communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take great issue with comments'' made on the ``60 Minutes
II'' program, French added.
</P>
<P>
   Charter, which operates about 90 psychiatric hospitals, denies
system-wide wrongdoing. The company is half-owned by Magellan
Health Services, which is moving its corporate headquarters from
Atlanta to Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, the federal agency that oversees Medicare and
Medicaid said deficiencies recently found at a Charter hospital in
New Hampshire ``constitute a serious and immediate threat to the
health and safety of people receiving services at this facility.''
</P>
<P>
   The Health Care Financing Administration report cited injuries
among child and adolescent patients while restrained; improper use
of seclusion; inappropriate sexual activity by patients; and injury
to patients from self-abuse. No new Medicare or Medicaid patients
can enter that Nashua, N.H., facility after Wednesday, and patients
there currently will be relocated to another facility, HCFA said.
</P>
<P>
   An HCFA spokesman said Monday that the exclusion of the New
Hampshire hospital as an immediate threat to patients is the first
in the agency's history.
</P>
<P>
   Charter said it hoped that a corrective action plan, submitted
to federal officials, would persuade HCFA to rescind the order for
the Nashua hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The federal probe of Charter hospitals in Boston and Nashua,
N.H., came as a result of a routine review, Charter said.
</P>
<P>
   The company has hired consulting firm Towers Perrin to review
its policies and procedures, including training and staffing.
Charter is also reviewing clinical care at all its hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   French acknowledged the ``60 Minutes II'' program had a brief
impact on company revenues. He said managed-care firms that had
suspended patient referrals to Charter facilities have resumed much
of that business.
</P>
<P>
   The federal Office of the Inspector General, which fights
health-care fraud, is reviewing the CBS News allegations against
Charter. And a recent Magellan filing with the Securities and
Exchange Commission said the OIG, the Department of Justice and
other federal agencies are investigating Charter facilities.
</P>
<P>
   The National Alliance for the Mentally Ill, a consumer advocacy
group, said Charter's patient-care problems also are present in
psychiatric facilities run by other organizations, including
state-run hospitals and residential treatment programs.
</P>
<P>
   Poorly trained workers, in understaffed facilities, often resort
to violence, including placing patients in physical restraints when
patients become agitated, noted Clarke Ross, NAMI's deputy
executive director for public policy.
</P>
<P>
   NAMI supports congressional legislation limiting use of
restraints, and increased regulation of psychiatric facilities,
including public reporting of deaths and serious injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want more external review of the use of restraints,'' Ross
said.
</P>
<P>
   The ``60 Minutes II'' program opened with a discussion of the
death of a 16-year-old at Charter's Greensboro, N.C., hospital. The
patient, Tristan Sovern, died in restraints. According to CBS News,
Sovern had a towel and then a sheet wrapped around his mouth, and
died of asphyxiation.
</P>
<P>
   Though Charter opposes the increased regulation, Ross said, the
company ``is making a conscientious effort to improve their
internal operations.''

PROTESTERS URGE BUSH TO SEEK LAW AGAINST HATE CRIMES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAIME CASTILLO  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ About two dozen people marked the one-year
anniversary Monday of the dragging death of James Byrd Jr. with a
prayer vigil and a plea to Gov. George W. Bush to call a special
legislative session to pass a bill against hate crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers, who did not include members or representatives of
the Byrd family, urged Bush to delay his foray into presidential
politics, if necessary, to deal with the issue by the end of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is scheduled to begin a four-day trip Saturday to Iowa and
New Hampshire to test the waters for his all-but-announced bid for
the Republican presidential nomination next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I promise you had we not received a tax break, (Bush) would
have called a special session to make sure a tax break bill would
have been passed,'' Kyev Tatum, a spokesman for the National
Coalition of African-Americans United for Self Empowerment, said of
major legislation that passed in the just-completed Texas
legislative session.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're asking for him to do is to do the exact same thing
he would do with taxes or with education reform or with any of
those issues he is extremely compassionate about,'' Tatum added.
</P>
<P>
   A comprehensive hate crimes bill named for Byrd, the Jasper man
who was dragged behind a pickup truck for more than 2 miles until
his body lay in tatters, passed the Democratic-led Texas House but
died in a Republican-controlled Senate committee.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would have stiffened penalties for most crimes fueled
by race, ethnicity, gender, disability, religion or sexual
preference.
</P>
<P>
   The issue split lawmakers along party lines with Democrats
charging their Republican colleagues with backing off the
legislation because it provided protections for homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   GOP lawmakers responded that it was more divisive to split
people into groups by making them different in the eyes of the law.
The Republican governor, who has resisted saying whether he would
have signed the bill if it had reached his desk, said he does not
believe new legislation is necessary to deal with crimes motivated
by hate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush encourages prosecutors to use the tough hate
crimes law already on the books in Texas,'' said Scott McClellan, a
Bush spokesman. ``Texas has tough anti-crime laws on the books, and
those who commit heinous crimes will be held accountable.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the James Byrd Jr. Act, however, contend the
state's current law on hate crimes is based on a vague concept of
bias, which makes it difficult to enforce.
</P>
<P>
   Three white suspects were charged in connection with the death
of the 49-year-old Byrd. One defendant, John William King, 24, was
convicted earlier this year and sentenced to death. The others are
still awaiting trial.
</P>
<P>
   One of the participants in Monday's brief prayer session, the
Rev. Herman Foster of San Marcos, said Bush's response to the
group's cries will, in Foster's mind, offer a glimpse of the
governor's mettle for higher office.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is looking to run for president,'' Foster, 63, said. ``I
would think he would show himself now in terms of taking a stance
on a very important issue.''

JUSTICES DEAL BLOW TO TEXAS CASE INVOLVING DEAD TODDLER 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court on Monday dealt a devastating
blow to prosecutors seeking to convict an El Paso-area woman who
allegedly killed her baby daughter and then enlisted the public's
help in finding her ``missing'' child in January 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The justices, without comment, refused to hear the prosecution's
appeal of a Texas judge's decision prohibiting them from using at
trial incriminating statements the mother, Heidi Schramm Consaul,
allegedly made to police after requesting to speak with an
attorney. The high court's rejection of the appeal might end the
prosecution's case against Consaul, as lawyers will be unable to
use perhaps the most damning testimony _ her own statements _ at
trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're disappointed,'' said John Davis, chief appellate lawyer
in the district attorney's office for El Paso, Hudspeth and
Culberson counties. ``At this point, it's very doubtful that we can
go forward with a prosecution.''
</P>
<P>
   Consaul's compelling story of her missing 18-month-old daughter,
broadcast on local television, inspired sympathy from residents.
The FBI, sheriff's deputies and local rescue teams _ including one
from a nearby New Mexico county _ joined the hunt for the baby
girl.
</P>
<P>
   El Paso County detectives, suspecting the mother's involvement,
brought Consaul in for questioning and informed her of her right to
an attorney, which she accepted. She then demanded that the
officers find her daughter and later urged a television news
audience to aid in the search.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, after being informed she had failed a
lie-detector test, Consaul told officers she had awakened from a
nap and found her daughter had suffocated on a plastic bag. The
mother then allegedly led the officers into the desert near Horizon
City, where they found the child's body.
</P>
<P>
   When an autopsy revealed that the girl had been killed, Consaul
was charged with capital murder.
</P>
<P>
   The case against the mother rests largely on her incriminating
statement that she had abandoned her daughter's body. Hence, the
trial judge dealt a severe blow to the prosecution by ruling that
and other statements inadmissible because they followed Consaul's
request to speak with an attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Once the mother asked for counsel, the police were
constitutionally barred from questioning Consaul without a lawyer
present, the trial judge ruled. The Eighth District Court of
Appeals agreed with the judge.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, without comment, declined
to hear the prosecutors' appeal, prompting them to turn to the U.S.
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   In its appeal to the high court, the prosecution argued that
Consaul effectively rescinded her request for counsel when she
later told the police to find her daughter. Karen Landinger, an
assistant district attorney in El Paso, also said the mother's
request for an attorney expired when she left police ``custody''
and returned home, days before she told officers where they could
find her daughter's body.
</P>
<P>
   Consaul's demand for police action ``represented a desire of the
mother to open up a more generalized discussion with law
enforcement personnel relating directly or indirectly to the
investigation of her missing child, and constituted a re-initiation
of contact and waiver of her previous invocation of her right to
counsel,'' argued Landinger in a legal brief to the justices.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Without a big musical or Rosie O'Donnell to attract
viewers this year, the Tony Awards broadcast fell sharply in the
Nielsen ratings.
</P>
<P>
   In overnight figures from the country's 45 biggest cities, the
Tony Awards' rating was 7.9 on Sunday for the portion of the show
broadcast on CBS. That was down from a 10.3 rating last year, when
``The Lion King'' and ``Ragtime'' battled it out for best musical.
</P>
<P>
   The year before, the first time Ms. O'Donnell was the host, the
broadcast hit an 11.2 rating. (Each overnight rating point
represents 598,000 homes.)

AN AMBITIOUS END TO A CROSS-COUNTRY COLLABORATION

   SAN JOSE, Calif. &LR;   &LR; _ ``Surroundings: Responses to the American
Landscape,'' which opened Sunday at the San Jose Museum of Art,
culminates a four-year program of loan exhibitions from New York's
Whitney Museum of American Art. The four yearlong shows have drawn
a thematic survey from New York's greatest public collection of
20th century American art.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the last installment is neither climactic nor conclusive. It
portrays the century's end as a moment of artistic confusion,
marked by clashing ideas of art's social relevance.
``Surroundings'' leaves us wondering not only which of the works in
the exhibition future audiences might consider 20th century
classics, but also whether the idea of classic artworks will even
have a future.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at certain things in the show for the first time, such
as Keith Sonnier's glass and neon ``Ba-O-Ba, Number 3'' (1969) or
Alan Saret's tangle of wire, ``Mount Tai'' (1987), it is easy to
forget that landscape is the unifying thread of ``Surroundings.''
</P>
<P>
   The show's curators, Beth Venn of the Whitney and Cathy Kimball
of the San Jose museum, make a brave attempt to expand the
visitor's thinking beyond the traditional scope of landscape
imagery in painting.
</P>
<P>
   It may take several passes through the exhibition to notice some
of the less obvious linkages. For example, Sonnier's neon piece and
Edward Hopper's ``Railroad Sunset'' (1929) appear very different in
form and sensibility. Yet the play of color in them is startlingly
similar, almost as if Sonnier's work were an abstraction of
Hopper's.
</P>
<P>
   Noticing their chromatic rhyming, one might start to relate
Sonnier's work to neon street signs and thus to the emotional
desolation of the urban landscape, the subject of so many Hopper
paintings.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, were Sonnier's piece to be encountered in
another context _ say in San Jose's last Whitney show,
``Alternating Currents: American Art in the Age of Technology'' _
it might never be related to landscape at all.
</P>
<P>
   Too many of the affinities in ``Surroundings'' seem cleverly,
but superficially, contrived. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  For example, it is exciting to see Alex Katz's ``Dark
Reflections'' (1995) _ an unusually fine picture by an overrated
painter _ alongside Christopher Wilmarth's glass and steel
sculpture ``Clearing No. 1 of Nine Clearings for a Standing Man''
(1973). &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  The Katz, a nearly abstract image of a tree reflection in a
lake's surface by night, exudes a thin, gray-green light like that
which diffuses through the upright panel of green frosted glass in
Wilmarth's sculpture. Behind the glass the edges of a folded sheet
of steel soften and vanish as they recede, as though disappearing
into mist.
</P>
<P>
   The Wilmarth may be concerned with sensations of closeness and
distance, but to think of it as landscape sculpture is to take its
title too literally and shut down its mystery.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of works among the 59 pieces that fall readily
under the show's subtitle, ``Responses to the American Landscape.''
But for every Charles Burchfield, Georgia O'Keeffe or Marsden
Hartley, there is something such as George Sugarman's meandering
painted wood sculpture ``Inscape'' (1964) _ a satisfying, seldom
exhibited work _ or Louise Nevelson's ``Rain Forest Columns,''
which seem to be included more because of their titles than for
what they are.
</P>
<P>
   And there are some curious omissions. Robert Morris and Michael
Heizer are represented by drawings, so where is Robert Smithson?
</P>
<P>
   The show tightens up again in the last room, where the line
between social and natural landscape is blurred not by the curators
but by the artworks themselves.
</P>
<P>
   A drawing for Christo's colossal 1976 ``Running Fence,'' a
project that still lives in local memory, reminds us how powerfully
social and aesthetic dimensions can converge in artworks done on
the land. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Roger Brown's painting-with-diorama ``XXX Exxon'' (1989), on
the other hand, responds to the Exxon Valdez disaster so
heavy-handedly that its outrage is laughable.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps mindful that ``Surroundings'' was their last shot,
curators Venn and Kimball have tried to do too much, to blur too
many categories, call too much into question at once. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Still, the San Jose/Whitney program has been a success
overall.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, San Jose director Josi Callan struck a deal for a
series of long-term loans from the Whitney's permanent collection
with David Ross, then the Whitney's director. In June 1998, Ross
became director of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.
</P>
<P>
   Because San Jose has a small permanent collection, the idea was
to use the Whitney's resources to lay a foundation for future
programming. Each show has lasted a year, giving the South Bay art
public plenty of time to revisit it and see it play off against
other, more transient museum events.
</P>
<P>
   How much educational staying power the San Jose/Whitney
partnership will have remains to be seen. But the value of the
program during its run is beyond question. It argues for a home
truth about art: that there is no substitute _ high-tech or
otherwise _ for eyes-on confrontation with art objects themselves,
especially those considered canonical.
</P>
<P>
   We can only hope that other museums around the country take note
of San Jose's initiative and follow its example.

BOND PRICES RISE, THEN FALTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ROBERT HURTADO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bond prices faltered Monday after rising earlier in
the session for the first time in more than a week, as the higher
yield level for Treasuries attracted investors.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, at the end of New York trading, the price of the
benchmark 30-year bond was unchanged, at 90 5/32. Its yield, which
moves in the opposite direction from the price, remained at 5.96
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The covering of short positions in midmorning trading pushed
prices to session highs briefly, but concern that the strong
economy will ignite inflation and a lack of sustained interest
limited those gains.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is also waiting for retail sales, which may well be
stronger than the last couple of months and the consumer price
index,'' said Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset
Management. ``It has built in strong expectations of a near-term
Fed tightening.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the Commerce Department's scheduled release of the
Consumer Price Index, Fine continued that ``Even if next week's CPI
is nonthreatening, the Fed is still likely to tighten on June 30,
irrespective of the May CPI, because even a subdued CPI would have
to completely reverse market expectations in order to keep the
central bank on hold, which is very unlikely.''
</P>
<P>
   Adam Blankman, an analyst at Standard &AMP; Poor's MMS in San
Francisco, puts the chances for a Fed move at slightly less than
even. ``If you thought the May employment report would provide a
clear sense of where the Fed would be headed in the month ahead,
then think again,'' he said. ``The data were far from bullish, but
there were enough contradictions to prevent Treasuries from
extending the recent slide.''
</P>
<P>
   Many market participants are already predicting a quarter-point
increase and expect this week's economic reports to provide enough
incentive for the 30-year bond to test the 6 percent level, though
Blankman thinks that the final outcome will rest with the mid-month
congressional testimony by Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe the Fed will wait for a smoking gun to hike
rates,'' Blankman said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Pugliese, senior vice president and director of fixed
income at J.W. Genesis Financial Corp. in Boca Raton, Fla., said:
``It's difficult psychologically to buy today when there is a
chance it will be cheaper tomorrow. We have not seen the highest
rates for the year yet.''
</P>
<P>
   During Monday's weekly auction of new bills, the three-month
bills were awarded at an average rate of 4.51 percent, down from
4.62 percent last week, while the six-month bills were awarded at
an average rate of 4.76 percent, a tick higher than the 4.75
percent in that same auction a week ago.

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Like many old-style Mexican matriarchs, Emma
Castro Amador bore so many children that she cannot keep their
birthdays straight. Sometimes she even loses track of whether
Oscar, her 10th, came before David, her 11th.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I never regret having so many,'' says Mrs. Castro, who is
59 and bore 14 children in 25 years. ``I know the government tells
everybody to have fewer now, but I think its none of their
business.''
</P>
<P>
   On that point, however, none of Mrs. Castro's offspring agree
with her. In a generational divide repeated in millions of Mexican
families, all 14 say they are determined to limit their own
families to two or three children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Small families live better,'' says Gloria Munoz Castro, Mrs.
Castro's eldest daughter, repeating the jingle, broadcast
incessantly on television here for 25 years, after the government
reversed its population policies overnight to put a brake on
exploding growth. She has two children and says she will have no
more.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, Mexico's population is projected to reach 100
million, and the contrast between Mrs. Castro's family and those of
her children illustrates the extraordinary changes underway in the
country's family and population patterns, which hold important
consequences for the rest of North America.
</P>
<P>
   Because Mexican women like Mrs. Castro traditionally had so many
children, the population has quintupled since 1940, and will
continue to surge at about 1 million people a year for nearly three
decades.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment will remain high, since even when the economy is
robust it cannot provide jobs for the 1.3 million new workers who
go on the job market each year. Many of the jobless will continue
to emigrate; over the next decade, some 3.5 million Mexicans are
projected to travel to the United States to work and establish
residence.
</P>
<P>
   But because Mrs. Castro's children and others of the new
generation have opted for smaller families, Mexico's population is
projected to stop growing by 2045. As growth slows, Mexican
emigration to the United States could begin to slow within a decade
or so, according to a 1997 study on migration by the countries' two
governments. Demographers debate that point, however.
</P>
<P>
   The tremendous reduction in fertility, from 7 children per woman
in 1965 to 2.5 today, has brought a significant drop in the number
of dependent children supported by each worker. That is offering
Mexico what population experts call a ``demographic bonus,'' the
opportunity to generate higher savings rates and domestic
investments that can bring rapid development if the bonus is
managed shrewdly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The drop in fertility is a spectacular change that has meant a
revolution in mental attitudes,'' said Dr. Rodolfo Tuiran
Gutierrez, secretary general of Mexico's government-run National
Population Council. ``It's opening a demographic window of
opportunity for Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   When Emma Castro was born in 1940, Mexico's population was 19.6
million, little changed from what it had been in 1910, at the
outset of the Mexican Revolution. She married at 15 after a one-day
courtship, and bore her first son the following year, 1956. For the
next 25 years she bore one child, on average, every 21 months.
</P>
<P>
   Her experience was typical. In 1956, an American anthropologist,
Oscar Lewis, began collecting an oral history of a poor Mexico City
family, later published as ``The Children of Sanchez.'' When Lewis
first interviewed the patriarch, Jesus Sanchez, he had four
children, but when Mexican reporters interviewed him 14 years
later, Hernandez had fathered 16 more children.
</P>
<P>
   Government policy encouraged rapid growth, partly for historical
reasons. Mexicans believed that the 19th Century seizure of Mexican
territories stretching from Texas to California by the United
States would have been impossible had they not been so sparsely
populated.
</P>
<P>
   But in the late 1960s, as Mexico's postwar economic boom began
to slow, the population figures began to alarm experts. In 1970,
Mexico's population hit 48 million, and in an influential study
several prominent Mexican demographers warned that unless policies
changed it would more than triple by the year 2000, to 148 million.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with the challenge to national stability those projections
implied, President Luis Echeverria Alvarez in 1974 reversed course,
establishing a National Population Council to control population
growth and a network of government clinics to help couples plan
their families.
</P>
<P>
   The reversal came as women's attitudes about birth control were
already changing; ignoring the government and the Roman Catholic
hierarchy, many women in the 1960s and early 1970s were buying
contraceptives on the black market. As a result, the government's
new offer of family planning services began satisfying a repressed
demand, and Mexican families began changing dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``We were determined to have just two,'' said Munoz Castro, who
married in 1977. ``We didn't want to spend all our money just to
feed and clothe children.''
</P>
<P>
   Several of Gloria's married siblings and in-laws have no
children. Eira Hernandez Ramirez, a 39-year-old sister-in-law,
explained her childlessness: ``Food is expensive, the oil is
running out, water is scarce,'' she said. ``The future's just too
bleak.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But even though Mexican birth rates have plummeted, the
population has continued to expand. Although none of Emma Castro's
14 children have borne nearly as many children as she did, they
have produced 23 grandchildren. And millions of others in their
generation have formed new families, too. That is why the
population surged from 66.8 million in 1980 to 81 million in 1990
and is projected to reach 100 million next year.
</P>
<P>
   For more than two decades, the economy has failed to keep up
with the exploding population. Jean Maninat, director of the Mexico
office of the International Labor Organization, said that about 1.3
million new workers join Mexico's job market each year.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the population pressure,'' Maninat said. ``And despite
the government's efforts to generate investments, never in any year
has the economy created that many jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   In good years, the expanding economy and new investments can
create 900,000 or perhaps 1 million new jobs, leaving about 300,000
new job seekers unemployed. In 1995, a recession year, Mexico lost
500,000 jobs, meaning that together with the 1.3 million new
job-seekers, the ranks of the the unemployed grew by a total of 1.8
million.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico has accumulated at least 12 million unemployed since
population growth began to overwhelm the economy.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   A vast army of other Mexicans are sort-of-employed in the
informal sector, the platoons of windshield washers who converge on
cars at street corners and battalions of chewing gum vendors who
clog downtown sidewalks.
</P>
<P>
   Still others have emigrated to the United States. During the
1960s, only about 27,000 workers left Mexico each year to establish
permanent residence in the United States, according to Mexican
government figures. Today, it is currently about 277,000 a year,
according to the migration study.
</P>
<P>
   For the next 10 years or so, population growth is expected to
continue to generate mass emigration and millions of new
unemployed. But as the effects of the dropoff in fertility rates
continue, the number of people who join the job market each year is
projected to fall to about 650,000 in 2010, government demographers
estimate.
</P>
<P>
   If the economy continues to grow, then the number of Mexicans
who emigrate to the United States each year, legally and illegally,
could begin to decline, according to the migration study. But some
demographers believe that because wages in the United States are
often 10 times as high as they are here for the same work, Mexicans
will continue to emigrate even when jobs are available here.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The slowing growth is bringing Mexico good news of another kind.
In 1970, for every 100 Mexican workers there were 100 dependents,
mostly children and a few retired people. As the children have
grown up and entered the work force, this ``dependency ratio'' has
declined, to about 60 dependents for each 100 workers. By the year
2020, the burden of non-working dependents should decline still
further, to about 40 per 100 workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a moment in the evolution of populations when they
have the absolute best structure for development, and that's the
structure Mexico is developing right now,'' said Eduardo Arriaga,
an Argentine demographer who is a lecturer at Georgetown
University.
</P>
<P>
   This demographic bonus gives Mexico the opportunity to increase
domestic savings and with sensible economic management, could
result in higher per-capita economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   The bonus phase of Mexico's demographic transition is expected
to last for 30 years. By then, the population will be, on average,
far older than it is today, and millions of Mexicans will need
retirement care.
</P>
<P>
   The costs of caring for the elderly will be higher, because most
retired Mexicans now live with their children. But because the
characteristically large Mexican family is shrinking, increasing
numbers of Mexicans live alone, and in the future the elderly may
not be able to count on home care provided by their children.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mexican family is being transformed in crucial ways,''
said Carlos Welti, a demographer at Mexico's National Autonomous
University. ``Throughout our history, an important social safety
network has been the extended family, uncles, cousins. In the
future, fewer will have these relationships.''

`BLUES' PROTESTS BEING CUT BY CBS FROM TONY SHOW
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By ROBIN POGREBIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The morning after the Tony Awards ceremonies, it
wasn't the winners that theater professionals were talking about.
It was the musical number from ``It Ain't Nothin' but the Blues''
that was dropped from the CBS broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   The awards presentation, which is considered vital to the
financial health of many shows, featured high points from all the
other nominated musicals, including ``The Civil War,'' ``Fosse''
and two shows that have closed, ``Parade'' and ``Little Me.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the Sunday night Tony broadcast was running long, the
production number from ``Blues'' was eliminated at the last minute
to meet the network's strict cutoff time of 11 p.m., Eastern time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really unconscionable what happened,'' said Rocco
Landesman, the president of Jujamcyn Theaters, which experienced a
similar incident in 1996 with ``Smokey Joe's Cafe.'' He said, ``The
producer didn't seem to have control of the time.''
</P>
<P>
   The producers of the awards show, Tony Award Productions,
responded to an interview request by issuing a statement saying the
number was cut because ``it became clear that the show was running
long.'' The statement indicated that other material was cut as
well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We share in the disappointment of our community that the fine
performance of `It Ain't Nothin' but the Blues' and the other
elements of the broadcast fell prey to one of the inherent perils
of live television,'' the statement read.
</P>
<P>
   Producers of ``Blues'' said the effect could be dire. ``Cutting
this because of a disorganized Tony event could actually close
us,'' said Anita Waxman, one of the producers of ``Blues.'' She
added, ``So there are a lot of serious consequences to this
ridiculous little thing that happened last night.''
</P>
<P>
   Winning a Tony Award can mean a boost at the box office as well
as artistic bragging rights, but a live appearance on the
nationally broadcast show has also proved pivotal to many a
musical's future.
</P>
<P>
   The long-running success of ``Smokey Joe's Cafe'' is largely
attributed to the number that was featured on the Tonys in 1996. A
second number from ``Smokey Joe's'' was cut from the broadcast,
prompting protests from the producers. ``This can be devastating to
a show,'' said Landesman, who produced ``Smokey Joe's.''
</P>
<P>
   The producers of ``Blues'' said they needed the visibility. The
show has been doing business slightly above break-even, said Eric
Krebs, one of the producers. ``In a year of problematic musicals,
clearly we would have had a major boost from national exposure,''
Krebs said. ``Much of our strategy as to how to promote the show
was based on this national broadcast _ reaching audiences
interested in musical theater.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the ``Blues'' producers mobilized immediately. As
soon as the ceremony ended, they met backstage at the Gershwin
Theater with the broadcast producers to air their complaints. They
also enlisted a high-powered Hollywood lawyer, Bertram Fields. And
on Monday, the ''Blues'' producers planned to meet with members of
the League of American Theaters and Producers and of the American
Theater Wing, which jointly presented the Tonys, in the hopes of
gaining some sort of redress.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Blues'' producers may ask to be reimbursed for the
six-figure amount they paid to appear on the Tonys _ each Broadway
show is assessed a certain amount of money, depending on the costs
of mounting each number. The producers may also try to obtain
appearances on other CBS programs to compensate for their loss of
national exposure.
</P>
<P>
   But the disappointment felt by the actors, producers say, will
be lasting, particularly because ``Blues'' was the only black show
among the nominees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do volunteer work with troubled kids in L.A., and I asked
them to watch the show last night,'' said Ron Taylor, the
co-creator of ``Blues,'' in a statement. ``I have a hard enough
time telling these kids that the establishment cares about them,
and last night showed them that the establishment doesn't care.''
Taylor was also nominated for his performance in the musical.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blues'' moved to the Vivian Beaumont Theater from an Off
Broadway house right before the deadline for consideration in order
to capitalize on a Tony appearance and the chance for an award.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe this will be the catalyst to create a show that really
reflects better on the industry,'' Krebs said.
</P>
<P>
   Some Broadway producers felt that the ``Blues'' incident
signaled a need to make the awards ceremony better managed, as well
as more exciting.
</P>
<P>
   Several people who attended said they thought the segment
featuring straight plays in which actors did an overlapping montage
of their lines was an indecipherable waste of time.
</P>
<P>
   For at least one show, the Tonys were a potential life raft.
They were just what ``Side Man'' had been waiting for _ or hanging
by a thread for. The play has been hemorrhaging money, holding on
in hope of a ticket-building Tony Award. It got that on Sunday
night, winning the award for best play, along with a victory for
its dogged featured actor, Frank Wood, also a sentimental favorite
as an actor who had toiled for 12 years in downtown theater only to
be finally rewarded.
</P>
<P>
   In a season heavy on British imports and short on new American
work, ``Side Man'' was the only entry in its category written by a
living American. (It competed with Tennessee Williams' recently
rediscovered play, ``Not About Nightingales,'' which came over from
London.)
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, ``The Iceman Cometh,'' which originated in London,
featured several British actors and received wide critical praise,
lost in all the categories in which it faced off with ``Death of a
Salesman,'' which originated at the Goodman Theater in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how the voters voted, and these are strange
competitions,'' said Emanuel Azenberg, an ``Iceman'' producer.
``I'm comforted by the fact that it's sold out _ and that's no mean
comfort.''

FRAGMENTED WITH 15 PARTIES, THE 15TH ISRAELI PARLIAMENT IS SWORN
IN
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Ahmed Tibi, a longtime adviser to Yasser Arafat, the
Palestinian leader, pledged his allegiance to the state of Israel
on Monday. A healthy white carnation gleamed on his lapel.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Tibi, a Jerusalem resident and a freshman member of
the new Israeli parliament, was asked pointedly if he had really
meant it. Smiling proudly, Tibi, a physician, said that from now on
he should be known as an Israeli member of parliament representing
the Arab population _ and a former adviser to Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   With trumpets and choral music, the 15th Israeli parliament was
sworn into office on Monday afternoon. It is one of the most
fragmented and colorful in the country's history, with 15 political
parties _ Jewish and Arab, secular and ultra-Orthodox, dovish and
hawkish _ whose varied interests represent a roiling challenge for
prime minister-elect Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
   ``In its political and personal makeup, it's an impossible
parliament,'' said Nachum Barnea, a leading columnist for Yediot
Ahronot. ``And its first victim will be the new government.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak was not sworn in as prime minister on Monday, because he
has not yet forged a coalition government from the competing and
disharmonious forces.
</P>
<P>
   Under the law, he has until July 8 to do so, but he is the first
prime minister who failed to assemble a coalition by the official
swearing-in date for parliament.
</P>
<P>
   That is largely due to a change in the electoral system when the
outgoing prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, was elected in 1996.
Netanyahu overcame the problem by hastily cobbling together a
government. Learning from Netanyahu's mistakes, Barak is in no
rush.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this created an odd frame for the afternoon's brief,
relatively pomp-free ceremonies. Netanyahu, who plans to quit
parliament, still occupied his old chair as the leader of the
nation, surrounded by many of his former Cabinet ministers. Thus
the defeated government sat front and center for an event that
effectively ushered it out of office.
</P>
<P>
   President Ezer Weizman, opening the ceremonies, said Israel,
divided by so many splinter groups, was ``plagued by exaggerated
internal criticism and a poor self-image.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it seems as though you have to travel abroad to hear
kind words about Israel,'' he said. ``We are a country with a great
past and a contentious present, but with a promising future. Please
stop the self-criticism.''
</P>
<P>
   The new 120-member parliament is bound to be a different
organism from its predecessor. A third of its members are new.
There are more immigrants and more women _ 14 _ than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   Among the new women is Dalia Rabin-Pelosoff, 49, daughter of the
late Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who was assassinated in 1995 by
a Jewish extremist. Watching the ceremony, Leah Rabin, his widow,
beamed as her daughter, a lawyer, joined parliament as the sixth
member of the new Center Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very touching,'' Mrs. Rabin said. ``And not only the
question of being a mother. I cannot help but think of Yitzhak's
absence. He's missing here.''
</P>
<P>
   In the new parliament, the two major parties that dominated
Israeli politics for 20 years, Labor and Likud, have shrunk,
reshaping the balance of power.
</P>
<P>
   Labor, now a coalition party called One Israel, has 26 members,
making it the largest party, but still smaller than ever in its
history.
</P>
<P>
   Likud has dwindled to 19 and lost its leader, Netanyahu. Ariel
Sharon, the outgoing foreign minister, serves as temporary
chairman. But the party, suffering disunity and disarray, is
gearing up for a leadership battle. Ehud Olmert, the mayor of
Jersualem, plans to announce his candidacy on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Shas, the Sephardic ultra-Orthodox party, has grown, making it
almost the equal of Likud in numbers, with 17 members. But Shas,
too, has lost its leader, Aryeh Deri, who was convicted of
corruption this spring and gave up his seat after the elections.
</P>
<P>
   Parliament used to be split fairly cleanly into doves and hawks,
but now its dividing lines are more varied. Russian immigrants,
absent just over three years ago, now fill 10 seats between two
parties. A new center has emerged. And the secular and religious
camps are both beefed up _ and ultra-antagonistic _ after a
rancorous campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the seating charts will force accommodations. Monday,
Tommy Lapid, for instance, a cantankerous television personality
whose antireligious platform earned his new Shinui Party six seats,
took his seat in parliament for the first time, next to another
newcomer, Rabbi Chaim Druckman, head of the yeshiva system for the
National Religious Party.
</P>
<P>
   Others joining parliament include Rabbi Michael Melchior, leader
of the dovish Orthodox Meimad movement and the chief rabbi of
Norway (which is obviously not a full-time job); Uri Savir, a
Center Party member and one of the architects of the Oslo accords
that have guided the Israeli-Palestinian peace effort; Gennady
Riguer, a Ukrainian-born engineer who began his life in Israel as a
street sweeper; and Husseina Jabarra, the first Israeli Arab woman
to serve.
</P>
<P>
   As the members' names were called out in alphabetical order,
there were two Levys, three Katzes and five Cohens. Ran Cohen of
Meretz and Raanan Cohen of One Israel were so confused that they
answered for each other.
</P>
<P>
   With a new parliament in place, Barak will return to the
daunting task of forging a government. He has said he anticipates
forming a mid-size coalition of 66 members, including the left, the
center, one Russian party, the settlers and the ultra-Orthodox of
European descent. But disagreements among them remain.
</P>
<P>
   Barak could turn to the 10 members of the Israeli Arab parties,
but he seems unlikely to take the politically explosive step of
including them in his cabinet. Sensing this, the left and the
Israeli Arab community, which supported him almost unanimously,
have been harshly critical.
</P>
<P>
   But even if not admitted to the inner circle, the Israeli Arabs
are almost guaranteed to support Israeli-Arab peace negotiations _
and a One Israel government.
</P>
<P>
   Whether to include Shas is the thorniest question, but top
politicians in One Israel have been seeking to rehabilitate Shas'
image and to argue for its inclusion. They have portrayed Shas,
which is a both a religious and an ethnic pride movement, as a
necessary partner for peace. And Barak seems inclined to seek the
party's participation.

BLACK HOLLYWOOD SALUTES ITSELF
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif. N.Y., Pa., Mexico)   (jw) 
 By FELICIA R. LEE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is an incubator for the next generation of black filmmakers,
a chance to network and a respite from the business and art
conundrum. The Acapulco Black Film Festival in Mexico, now in its
third year, is also gaining a reputation for putting a high gloss
on hard work.
</P>
<P>
   The roster for this year's festival, which runs Tuesday through
Saturday, is a Who's Who of black Hollywood: Samuel L. Jackson and
Pam Grier are to receive career achievement awards this year. Spike
Lee, Denzel Washington, Oprah Winfrey, Angela Bassett and Whoopi
Goldberg are among this year's award nominees in a range of ``best
of'' categories in film, acting, writing, directing and music. The
poet Maya Angelou; Forest Whitaker, the actor and director; Regina
King, an actress, and Taye Diggs, an actor, are to take part in
workshops and panels.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of the festival is the screening of seven new
films and a new works in progress section to present and give
critiques of six others.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have a process of self-validation,'' said the
director and producer Warrington Hudlin, president of the Black
Filmmaker Foundation. The foundation sponsors the festival with
UniWorld Films, a division of Uniworld, a Manhattan-based black
advertising agency.
</P>
<P>
   Hudlin and his associates started the festival 19 years after
the founding of the Black Filmmaker Foundation because of blacks'
minuscule representation in Hollywood, from executives to actors,
as well as a sense that blacks received token representation at
most film festivals and award ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't allow your validation to come from outside your
community,'' said Hudlin, who with his brother Reginald has
produced and directed ``House Party'' ``Boomerang'' and ``Cosmic
Slop.'' ``Hollywood's psychic needs and emotional needs are often
so antithetical to the black community's needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Hudlin says that too many Hollywood executives support films
that uphold whites as the exemplars of beauty, courage,
intelligence and the like at the expense of people of color.
</P>
<P>
   The mixed reviews and disappointing box office returns for
``Beloved'' last year made things worse for black film, some say.
``Beloved,'' based on the Toni Morrison novel about the trauma of
slavery, starred Ms. Winfrey and was directed by Jonathan Demme.
Virtually every studio has been increasingly reluctant in recent
years to bankroll serious black films, saying they do not bring in
audiences or money. Given its star wattage, ``Beloved'' was seen by
Hollywood as a litmus test.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to get out there and do it for ourselves,'' said
Debbie Allen, the actress, writer and director, who won a career
achievement award last year at the festival. One of her most recent
film projects was ``Amistad,'' the story of a slave ship revolt
that she proposed to Steven Spielberg and for which she was a
producer. She is now writing and directing a film about a woman who
is possessed by the soul of a former lover.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real point is volume,'' Ms. Allen said of black films.
``There are so many films made by whites that don't do well. If you
have 10 comedies or 10 dramas, surely you'll get one blockbuster.''
</P>
<P>
   The film festival is not only an opportunity to nurture new
talent; it also exists to create networks of power like those that
exist in the music industry, the backers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are rich African-Americans who can finance movies,''
said the filmmaker Robert Townsend, the festival's master of
ceremonies. ``It's really about encouraging people to take charge
of their destiny.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Townsend said the goal of parity in Hollywood had to be viewed
as a long-distance run rather than a sprint. His own 1987 film,
``Hollywood Shuffle,'' is a classic paean to blacks in the movie
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Duke, actor and director of films like ``Sister Act 2: Back
in the Habit'' and ``A Rage In Harlem'' and a 1997 career
achievement award winner, is conducting an actor's ``boot camp'' at
the festival. He said the gathering had already led to some film
deals.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Scott Cherot's film ``Hav Plenty'' was shown at the
first film festival in 1997 and went on to theatrical release by
Miramax in 1998. He directed, wrote and starred in the film, which
was called a ``witty screwball comedy'' by Stephen Holden, a film
critic for The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Alison Swan's film ``Mixing Nia,'' about the adventures of a
young woman who is black and Jewish, won the Magic Johnson Best of
Festival Award last year and was subsequently sold to HBO, which
plans to show it in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a lot of contacts there,'' Ms. Swan said of the
festival in an interview from Los Angeles, where she is working on
a film adaptation of ``The Other Side of the River: A Story of Two
Towns, a Death and America's Dilemma,'' a book by Alex Kotlowitz
about the mysterious death of a black teen-ager in a small Michigan
town. In addition to meeting other filmmakers, she was able to get
a job directing a show on Nickelodeon that led to getting into the
Directors Guild of America.
</P>
<P>
   Donnice Wilson, a Los Angeles-based producer and writer whose
festival entry is a comedy about a womanizing minister called ``The
Rev. Do Wrong Ain't Right!'' said that being featured in the
festival's ``works in progress'' segment was a career breakthrough.
``I went to the first festival and I learned `don't be afraid to be
different,' '' Ms. Wilson said. ``Just because urban drama is what
we see, it doesn't mean that's the only thing out there.''
</P>
<P>
   For Rob Hardy, who grew up in Philadelphia and made his first
film in high school, the festival and the growing visibility of
black filmmakers have made a career in movies seem viable to many
young African-Americans. Even so, Hardy notes that he earned an
engineering degree to allay the worries of his parents.
</P>
<P>
   Hardy wrote and directed ``Trois,'' about a corporate lawyer who
persuades his wife to enter a menage a trois and has to live with
the results. It will be screened in Acapulco as a work in progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a plan for independent theatrical release,'' said
Hardy, who works in Atlanta. ``Getting the film made is the first
great obstacle. Getting the film to market is almost as great an
obstacle.''
</P>
<P>
   More buyers _ cable companies, motion pictures companies and
production companies _ will be in Acapulco this year than in past
years, Hudlin said, adding that Miramax, Cinemax, Showtime and USA
Studios were expected to attend.
</P>
<P>
   HBO, which Hudlin says has been especially supportive, is the
festival's presenting sponsor and will present winners of the HBO
Short Film Award. The grand prize winner is to receive a grant and
paid apprenticeship with HBO NYC Productions, a movie division of
the network. The Walt Disney Co., Magic Johnson Theaters and Bank
of America are among other corporate partners of the festival.
</P>
<P>
   The festival theme this year is love, sex and romance. The four
films from the United States include ``Love and Action in
Chicago,'' directed by Dwayne Johnson-Cochran and starring Courtney
Vance as a religious hit man; ``Personals,'' directed by Mike
Sargent and starring Malik Yoba as a journalist investigating the
dating business; ``An Invited Guest,'' a psychological thriller
directed by Timothy Folsome about a screenwriter who neglects his
wife, and ``Loving Jezebel,'' directed by Kwyn Bader, about a man
who always ends up with someone else's woman.
</P>
<P>
   Three foreign films from directors in Tunisia, the Congo and
Canada are to be screened. Two films explore questions of identity
and one is the story of an overweight musical prodigy.
</P>
<P>
   Some hard conversations are inevitable. As Hudlin and his
associates noted at the festival's founding, there are virtually no
blacks in the top echelons of movie studios. And blacks represent
less than 5 percent of the members of the Academy of Motion Picture
Arts and Sciences and the Directors Guild of America.
</P>
<P>
   Opportunities for black actors also remain scarce, studies by
the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the
U.S. Commission on Civil Rights and film industry groups have
shown.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a huge need for this, still,'' Kristal Brent Zook, a
professor of Pan-African studies at California State University in
Northridge, said of the Acapulco festival. Ms. Zook is the author
of ``Color by Fox: The Fox Network and the Revolution in Black
Television'' (Oxford University Press).
</P>
<P>
   ``Black films always have to fit into a paradigm that's
comfortable for mainstream audiences,'' she said, adding,
``Mainstream media are behind in that they haven't grasped the
complexities of America.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Black Americans have had to understand white culture to
survive,'' Ms. Zook said. ``There is a fine line that white America
walks between being interested in black culture and willingness to
engage black Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hollywood is more than a business. It's a reflection of where
we are as a society.''

AS TERM NEARS END, SUPREME COURT FACES TOUGH CASES 
</HEADLINE>
 COURT-HNS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Before the end of the month, the Supreme Court may
decide some of its toughest cases of the year _ whether
disabilities that have been corrected should be a bar to
employment, whether police can force loiters to move on and under
what conditions victims of job discrimination can sue for punitive
damages.
</P>
<P>
   In two cases, the court is asked to determine whether people who
correct disabilities through medication, eyeglasses, hearing aids
or other medical devices still deserve to be protected by the 1990
Americans With Disabilities Act.
</P>
<P>
   The cases involve a man with high blood pressure who was fired
as a truck driver and two nearsighted women who wanted to become
United Airlines pilots.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn Murphy of Manhattan, Kan., was fired by United Parcel
Service because of hypertension. When he sued, a judge threw the
case out because medication controls his problem and eliminates the
disability. Murphy since has found another job but is still suing
UPS.
</P>
<P>
   In the airline case, twin sisters Karen Sutton and Kimberly
Hinton, who were licensed as pilots for commuter airlines, applied
for jobs with United Airlines but were rebuffed because they
couldn't meet United's requirement for uncorrected vision of
20/100.
</P>
<P>
   The sisters claimed in their lawsuit that the requirement is
unfair. But the airline replied that because their eyesight was
corrected by glasses, they are not disabled under the meaning of
the ADA. A court of appeals ruled for the airline, but other
federal courts have ruled the other way.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, employers have fared well in ADA court battles.
They've won 92 percent of the 700 ADA cases resolved in court from
1992 to 1997, according to a study by the American Bar Association.
</P>
<P>
   But now employers feared that victories by the workers in the
current Supreme Court cases could lead to another slew of lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way in which the court defines the ADA will make all the
difference in the world as far as protecting the rights of disabled
people in the workplace,'' said Sally Dunaway, spokeswoman for the
American Association of Retired Persons, a Washington-based
organization for people 50 and older.
</P>
<P>
   In May, the court unanimously decided that people who received
federal benefits because of disabilities can still sue under the
ADA to force employers to accommodate them at their jobs. A Texas
woman named Carolyn Cleveland had suffered a stroke, temporarily
received Social Security disability pay, and with some
rehabilitation, returned to work part time. But after what she said
were taunts from fellow employees and the refusal of her company to
help her accommodate her disability, her work deteriorated and she
was fired.
</P>
<P>
   In its decision the high court overruled lower courts that had
said someone who is or was on Social Security disability benefits
is by definition unfit for employment and is either barred from
suing on grounds of disability discrimination or faces special
judicial hurdles in pursuing such a lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Another important case awaiting decision will determine if a
commonly used police tactic is constitutional.
</P>
<P>
   As issue is a 1992 Chicago ordinance that allows police to tell
loiters and others to move on and then arrest them if they don't.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 45,000 people were arrested under the law before the
Illinois Supreme Court in 1997 declared it an unconstitutional,
``arbitrary restriction on personal liberties.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the law say it criminalizes ordinary behavior in a
way that restricts First Amendment freedoms of assembly,
association and expression.
</P>
<P>
   The last major case yet to be decided involves the definition of
``reckless indifference'' _ two words in a federal anti-sexual
harassment law that could end up costing employers who lose
workplace bias lawsuits millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   A law that Congress passed in 1991 allows bias victims to
collect punitive damages in addition to back pay. But such damages
can be awarded only in cases when an employer's conduct shows
``reckless indifference'' to the bias that the employee suffered.
</P>
<P>
   During arguments before the high court in March, Chief Justice
William Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia, Sandra Day O'Connor,
Anthony Kennedy and Stephen Breyer accused Congress of enacting an
ambiguous law.
</P>
<P>
   ``This statute is simply confusing,'' Rehnquist said. ``Nobody
can pretend that's a clear guideline.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   By the end of its term on June 28, the court is expected to have
decided 90 cases, a number significantly lower than in years past.
Ten years ago, the court issued opinions in 146 cases. In 1981 it
handed down 170 opinions.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for the decline, according to legal experts, has been
court's increasingly conservative nature.

   ``This court simply has decided that it isn't the place where
people should go to get answers to every question,'' said Sherman
Cohn, a Supreme Court expert at Georgetown University here.
</P>
<P>
   Cohn said the court's most conservative members _ Rehnquist,
Scalia and Clarence Thomas _ often want state legislatures and
Congress to decide policies on most controversial issues such as
school vouchers, campaign financing, affirmative action and gay
rights. ``They just don't believe the court should be the last word
on these issues,'' Cohn said.

   No sleeping in on Sunday morning for San Francisco Mayor
 &UR; Willie Brown &LR; , who waltzed in his City Hall palace at the Black &AMP;
White Ball. Brown flew to Birmingham, Ala., on Sunday to be honored
for his commitment to education by the University of Alabama at
Birmingham, which made him a doctor of humane letters.
</P>
<P>
   He was nominated for the honor by the university's president,
 &UR; W. Ann Reynolds &LR; , who had been chancellor of California State
University when Assemblyman Brown was a trustee.
</P>
<P>
   Brown spoke about diversity in San Francisco and at the
Birmingham medical school. The Birmingham News quoted his speech:
``As graduates you have taken the first step to a life  &LR; long
commitment to learning,'' said Brown. ``All of this represents
something very special.''
</P>

<P>
   In an advice column written by  &UR; Alfonse D'Amato  &LR; in George
magazine, a woman in her ' &LR; 30s asks the former Republican senator
how she should handle a relationship with a ladies' man who is also
a younger man.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're just looking to fool around,'' advises D'Amato,
``then I say have a good time. But if you want a long-term
relationship, you need to look elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato appended a little notice of his own availability: ``I
suggest that you look for an older man who's not wealthy but can be
very charming.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Next time,'' he wrote charmingly, ``include your phone number,

   &UR; Pierre Salinger &LR; , journalist and former press representative of

Internet rumors about TWA Flight 800 being shot down by the Navy.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the saddest things that has happened to me was the
damaging effect this affair had on my future speaking engagements
around the United States,'' Salinger wrote in a column in the
Georgetowner. ``My agent  &UR; Janet Cosby &LR; , who used to engage me for
15 important speeches a year, &LR;  (at $10,000 to $20,000 per speech),
has only given me one since my comments on TWA 800.''
</P>
<P>
   Salinger still seems to believe the rumor. He wrote of a tape he
has since found that provides evidence that ``there were three Navy
ships in the area which could have shot down the plane.''

 UNDATED: Enforcement Administration.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``It is given under very safe conditions,'' Kleber said. ``We
carefully monitor the effects of drugs on the body. And they have
to keep responding on a computer to tell us how they feel.''
</P>
<P>
   The testing takes place in a small room, where the addict is
wired to a battery of machines measuring vital functions like heart
rate and blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   During the individual sessions, which last about two hours, the
addicts answer a succession of questions from the computer. Are
they yawning or sweating? Do they feel depressed, sedated or
energetic? How much would they pay for the heroin they feel, on a
scale from nothing to $20? On the street, a bag of heroin supplying
a single high costs $10.
</P>
<P>
   ``Addicts don't like to be able to take drugs in controlled
circumstances like this,'' Kleber said. ``It's not the way they
prefer to take drugs. They want to use drugs when they want, as
much as they want.''
</P>
<P>
   The addict is also asked to perform tasks, like duplicating
patterns on a computer screen. ``People who are intoxicated have an
impairment of higher functions,'' said Dr. Adam M. Bisaga, a
psychiatrist who helps supervise the tests.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers watch from behind a one-way mirror. Every 20
minutes, a researcher steps in and takes a snapshot of a
volunteer's pupil to measure the heroin's effect. (Heroin
constricts it; cocaine dilates it.)
</P>
<P>
   During their hospital stays, the addicts must attend lectures
about heroin's effects on their bodies and learn about ways to
shake the habit. ``There's potential value for them at a later date
if they decide they do want treatment,'' Kleber said. And, he
added, ``they're free to leave at any time.''
</P>
<P>
   The addicts agree to participate in the studies for $25 a day,
but if they complete the study, the amount doubles to $50 a day,
for a maximum of about $2,700 which they must pick in weekly
intervals of $300 at the hospital after the study is over.
</P>
<P>
   When the participants pick up their checks, study workers try to
counsel them to seek treatment. They are also paid for several
weeks of detoxification and preparation before the studies
officially begin.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is for staying in the hospital for six weeks, which is
something that most people don't want to do,'' Kleber said.
``There's isolation, boredom, inactivity.''
</P>
<P>
   A third study financed under the federal grant focuses on heroin
users who do want treatment. They are given naltrexone, but no
heroin, as outpatients, with a spouse or friend as a monitor.
``It's a very sophisticated approach, teaching somebody to become
part of the therapy team,'' Fischman said.
</P>
<P>
   Here, the volunteers are paid only $25 a week, plus $3 for
transportation, if they keep taking the naltrexone and produce
clean urine in a drug test. The money is given in vouchers for
food, clothes for a job interview and what Kleber called other
``pro-social'' needs.
</P>
<P>
   About 810,000 Americans regularly use heroin, according to the
White House's Office of National Drug Control Policy, and 3.6
million are regular cocaine users, but a proven cure for their
addiction has yet to be found.
</P>
<P>
   And even when an addict withdraws from heroin, a cocaine habit
often remains.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Edward V. Nunes, the investigator for the cocaine studies,
estimated that at least 25 percent of people who take methadone to
block their addiction to heroin continue abusing cocaine. ``Part of
the trouble with cocaine is convincing the patient that they need
help.'' Nunes said. ``The majority of them really dance around
it.''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, the three other Columbia studies are looking at
cocaine and how its use is affected by desipramine, an
anti-depressant; respiridone, an anti-psychotic, and memantine, a
drug marketed in Europe for dementia and Alzheimer's disease. No
cocaine is dispensed in these studies because the volunteers have
accepted the offer for treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier studies have suggested that such medications may be
useful in blocking or diluting a cocaine high.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one has been successful in developing a drug for cocaine,''
Kleber said, ``so we're looking at treatment for sub-groups'' of
addicts whose underlying emotional and mental problems may have led
them to cocaine abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Kleber said that finding a cure for drug addicts would have
spillover benefits of reducing crime and cutting welfare and
health-care costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The community should support treatment,'' he said, ``not only
because it is good for the addict but also because it's good for
the rest of us.''

USE OF STUN BELTS POSES QUESTIONS FOR NATION'S COURTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds., skedded earlier as STUN-GUNS-PRISONS)  
(rm) 
 By WILLIAM GLABERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last June, a municipal court judge in Long Beach, Calif.,
decided that a defendant, Ronnie Hawkins, was being disruptive at
the defense table. The judge issued an order to a court officer
and, by remote control, Hawkins was zapped with 50,000 volts of
electricity from a stun belt the guards had placed on him before he
entered the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins' case of high-tech discipline led to a temporary
injunction by a federal judge against officials' use of stun belts
in Los Angeles County courts. It was one of the first such rulings
nationally against devices that are becoming standard equipment for
court officers and prison guards across the country. Though
law-enforcement officials say the devices are actually activated
sparingly, the jolt through a person's kidney can cause temporary
paralysis and loss of control of bodily functions.
</P>
<P>
   The California case and a report to be issued by Amnesty
International on Tuesday morning are focusing attention on the
devices, which are attached to some inmates in federal and state
prisons and local jails across the country, and some prisoners when
they are taken to court.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts say it is becoming increasingly urgent for the
courts nationally to rule on whether new stun technologies are
permissible.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say they violate the Constitution's prohibition of
``cruel and unusual punishment'' and international human rights
agreements. The manufacturers and some law-enforcement officials
say that the stun devices can often be the least violent method of
maintaining control.
</P>
<P>
   But because the stun belts can be abused, the courts need to
address the legal issues posed by the new requirement that some
prisoners wear them, said Paul G. Chevigny, an expert on
law-enforcement procedures at New York University Law School. ``I
don't think there is an ironclad answer,'' Chevigny said. ``If you
think the person is misbehaving, the legal question is whether the
force you use is reasonable.''
</P>
<P>
   Some critics, like Amnesty International, say they believe use
of stun belts is inherently unreasonable and should be banned even
if they are activated rarely. In the report to be issued on Tuesday
morning, Amnesty International says the prison authorities and
other law-enforcement officials are increasingly requiring inmates
to wear stun belts and other electroshock equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The report says that laws and regulations now permit the use of
stun belts in correctional systems in 20 states, by local
law-enforcement officials in 30 states and by federal officials,
including the Federal Bureau of Prisons.
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty International said it found more than 130 jurisdictions
in America where officials attach stun belts to inmates or where
correction officers used shields that can stun inmates. Incidences
of people stunned by the devices were in Gwinnett County, Ga., Dade
County, Fla., and Oakland, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The belts are illegal in Michigan, Massachusetts and New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the last several years in conjunction with a rapid rise
of the prison population, institutions all over the country are
looking for new ways to control prisoners and they are turning to
stun belts at an alarming rate,'' Curt R. Goering, deputy executive
director of Amnesty International, U.S.A., said in an interview on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Some prison authorities, like those in New York state, choose
not to use stun belts even though they are legally permissible.
``We feel we have appropriate procedures in place and don't feel
the need to use stun equipment,'' said Mike Houston, a spokesman
for the New York state Department of Correctional Services.
</P>
<P>
   Some prisons which have authorized corrections officers to have
some inmates wear the belts say they have strict limitations on
when they might be activated. The Federal Bureau of Prisons has
permitted officers to require some inmates to wear the devices, but
the bureau's spokesman, Todd Craig, said there were careful
safeguards requiring that they be worn only by inmates who present
security risks, like potential escapees.
</P>
<P>
   Craig said no federal prison official had yet administered a
shock to an inmate. But he said federal prison officials had
concluded that the belts were effective deterrents. ``If there are
technologies we can use to stop an escape or prevent an assault,
which will ultimately protect the public, we're going to use those
technologies,'' Craig said.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts say the device, in wide use for only a few years,
is too new for the courts to have reached any consensus about
whether it is legally permissible for officials to require inmates
to wear them. In general under the Constitution, said David A.
Strauss, a constitutional law expert at the University of Chicago,
the Supreme Court has said that ``wanton and unnecessary force''
against inmates can be unconstitutional as a violation of the
provision barring ``cruel and unusual'' punishment.
</P>
<P>
   But, Strauss and other legal experts said, courts have given
prison authorities wide latitude in controlling emergencies like
possible escapes or assaults. ``Judges, including the Supreme Court
justices, are inclined to give officials a lot of leeway before
deciding that there has been `wanton and unnecessary force,'''
Strauss said.
</P>
<P>
   In the California case, Hawkins filed a federal civil suit
seeking damages from officials and an injunction barring the use of
the belt. He asserted that the devices violated not only the
Constitution but also international human rights guarantees. Many
international treaties include language barring ``cruel, inhuman
and degrading treatment or punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   In a preliminary ruling in January, the federal judge, Dean D.
Pregerson, agreed that even if the belt were not activated it would
have a ``chilling effect'' on a defendant forced to wear it. For
example, Pregerson said, a defendant who was forced to wear a belt
and was representing himself, as Hawkins was, might be afraid to
object to a judge's ruling for fear of being shocked.
</P>
<P>
   He issued a temporary injunction while the case was awaiting a
full trial. Before that could be held, Los Angeles County appealed
to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San
Francisco, where the case is pending.
</P>
<P>
   Judy Hammond, a spokesman for Los Angeles County, said Hawkins'
case was the first time court officers had activated a stun belt.
</P>
<P>
   The case has been somewhat of an embarrassment for the industry
that manufactures electric-shock devices. Dennis Kaufman, president
of one of the large manufacturers, Stun-Tech Inc. in Cleveland,
said Monday that any use of a stun belt to punish a defendant would
be inappropriate. He said the belt was designed to stop escapes and
potential assaults, like attacks on corrections officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The belt is not to be used for punishment,'' Kaufman said.
``If it is, consequently, it is clearly a violation of civil rights
as well as a violation of what the belt was designed for.''
</P>
<P>
   Some advocates for prisoners say the devices present a worrisome
new turn of technology. ``In prison settings, it is a clear opening
for abuse,'' said Elizabeth Alexander, director of the National
Prison Project of the American Civil Liberties Union.
</P>
<P>
   But some corrections officials say there has been no evidence of
abuse. James Turpin, legislative liaison of the American
Correctional Association, a national trade group for correctional
officers and administrators, said he knew of no evidence that the
devices were used with any frequency.

JUDGE DELAYS TRIAL OF FORMER HUD SECRETARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GARY MARTIN  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A federal judge on Monday postponed until after
Labor Day the conspiracy trial of former Housing Secretary Henry
Cisneros on charges that he paid hush money to a former lover and
lied to the FBI about it.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. District Judge Stanley Sporkin said he would go ahead
with a June 21 hearing to determine whether taped telephone
conversations between Cisneros and Linda Jones of Lubbock, Texas,
will be admitted as evidence when the trial starts on Sept. 7.
</P>
<P>
   Medlar, a former San Antonio fund-raiser known by her married
name, Linda Medlar, is expected to testify June 21 as a government
witness that the tapes are authentic.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Simon, a Cisneros lawyer, is asking the judge for a
psychiatric examination of Medlar to determine whether she is
competent to testify.
</P>
<P>
   Simon said Medlar has ``suffered from a severe mental illness''
and once became addicted to medication she was prescribed for her
condition.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Jackowski, a prosecutor for Independent Counsel David
Barrett, said he would file a response with the court opposing the
psychiatric exam. Jackowski said Medlar suffers from depression.
</P>
<P>
   Sporkin is expected to rule on the motions June 21.
</P>
<P>
   In a jab at the defense, Jackowski said a previous examination
found Medlar to be straightforward and clear in her accounts and
actions.
</P>
<P>
   That prompted Simon to counter: ``The government jailed Mrs.
Medlar for lying.''
</P>
<P>
   Medlar is currently serving time in a federal prison for bank
fraud, obstruction of justice and money laundering. The charges
were filed in a 28-count indictment returned by a federal grand
jury in Texas as part of Barrett's $7 million investigation into
Cisneros' tryst with Jones. She pleaded guilty to the charges.
</P>
<P>
   She also faces one count of conspiracy in a 21-count indictment
handed down in December 1997 accusing her, Cisneros and two of his
aides, John Rosales and Sylvia Arce, with concealing from the FBI
$250,000 in payments from Cisneros to Medlar.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros and Medlar made their affair public in 1988, when he
was a popular mayor of San Antonio. Although the relationship
crumbled and Cisneros reconciled with his wife, Mary Alice
Cisneros, he continued to pay Medlar, who was unemployed.
</P>
<P>
   Those payments, the indictment charges, were concealed from FBI
agents conducting a background investigation into Cisneros'
nomination by President Clinton to be secretary of Housing and
Urban Development. He served in that job from 1993 to 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros is the second Clinton Cabinet member to face a jury
trial on charges of wrongdoing. Former Agriculture Secretary Mike
Espy was cleared by a jury on charges of taking bribes and illegal
gratuities.
</P>
<P>
   Sporkin has agreed to let prosecutors and defense lawyers poll
prospective jurors to determine the impact the independent counsel
investigation of Clinton has had on their ability to render a fair
verdict in the Cisneros case.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has been the target of an independent counsel
investigation into of his role into the failed Whitewater land
development in Arkansas since 1994. Last year, independent counsel
Kenneth Starr expanded that probe to include the president's sexual
affair with a White House intern. That investigation led to
Clinton's impeachment by the House of Representatives, although the
Senate failed to muster the votes to remove him from office.
</P>
<P>
   The judge admonished defense lawyers in the Cisneros case not to
ask personal questions and refrain from seeking essays from the
jury pool.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want a lot of questions that are impertinent and
violate people's privacy,'' Sporkin said.
</P>
<P>
   The judge delayed the start of the trial for three months to
allow for the questionnaire to be assembled and to give ample time
to seat a jury from a pool of 300 prospective jurors.
</P>
<P>
   Betsy Paret, the U.S. District Court's chief deputy for
administration, said the summer vacation months would make it hard
to gather that number of potential jurors in four weeks. The trial
was scheduled to begin July 6.
</P>
<P>
   The June 21 motions hearing is expected to last two days. Simon
has vowed to challenge Medlar's credibility on the tapes, which she
admits she altered.
</P>
<P>
   The tape-recorded conversations are considered crucial to the
government's case against Cisneros, who is heard instructing Medlar
avoid talking with FBI agents conducting the background
investigation and questioning their ability to track down things
financial.
</P>
<P>
   Simon told the court he would use the government's tape
recording expert to prove the tapes are not the originals, have
been altered, and therefore should not be admitted as evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Jackowski has countered that ``very few'' of the tapes were
``edited.''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI contends that Cisneros told investigators he paid Medlar
about $60,000 before he was nominated to head HUD. The indictment
charges Cisneros paid her $250,000, including $73,000 after he took
office on Jan. 21, 1993.

UNPROFESSIONAL BEHAVIOR RAISES WARNING FLAG

   LOS ANGELES _ Question: There is a company that I would like to
join, and they seemed to respond favorably to my resume. They set
up an interview, but canceled it at the last minute, and then
canceled two later interviews. Is there anything I should be doing
to get an interview with them? T.M.
</P>
<P>
   Answer: How would a company feel about you if you broke three
interview appointments? They would figure that you are either
uninterested or a flake, or perhaps an uninterested flake. Is there
any reason for you to think differently of them?
</P>
<P>
   You can go ahead and call the company for yet another interview,
and they will probably schedule it for you. Why shouldn't they?
They can always break it. The fact is that if they were truly
apologetic and equally interested in you, they would have already
set up another interview date or they would be calling you right
now to do so.
</P>
<P>
   In this labor market, with such a scarcity of applicants in so
many fields, a company that treats a potential employee with such
disregard is waving a gigantic red flag. And, in your case, they
have waved three of them.
</P>
<P>
   The best step is to continue your job search and focus on
companies that truly respond favorably to you, rather than a
company that ``seemed to respond favorably'' to you. If that
original company sets up yet another interview for you, and
something better comes along, you know what to do.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My manager sent me a written critique of a report that I
wrote, and the tone of his comments was arrogant and somewhat mean.
My report was not all that bad, and his review threw me off. Should
I let this go or should I say something? T.S.
</P>
<P>
   A: Even if the best thing that could be said about your report
is that you made an excellent choice of fonts, there would still be
no reason for your manager to be condescending or snide.
</P>
<P>
   The most effective managers understand how important it is to be
a coach for one's employees. Managers who jump at opportunities to
insult their staff when mistakes are made are demonstrating little
more that their own insecurity and incompetence.
</P>
<P>
   Tell your manager that you have some questions about the report
and his feedback, and you would like to meet with him to discuss
them. At the meeting, you should take out the report and his
review, go through the key sections of the report, and link them to
some quotes from his review.
</P>
<P>
   When he hears how his words actually sound, his reaction will be
quite telling. Perhaps he will clarify what he meant, backpedal a
little, rationalize that he was having a bad day, or even
apologize. Or, he may say nothing at all. Either way, you should
ask for his suggestions as to the ways to prevent these problems
from occurring in the future. And, speaking of suggestions, you can
suggest that one solution may be more two-way communication with
him during the report-writing process.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We work in a small professional office, and a new associate
was just hired. He is bright and obviously competent, but his
values and political views are diametrically opposed to mine in
many important areas. The problem is that he is always ready to
debate, and he has an answer for everything. I don't want to go
through this every day, and I don't know how to stop it. Any
suggestions would be appreciated. P.R.
</P>
<P>
   A: Your associate does not realize that although his values
differ from yours, they are no more valuable than yours.
</P>
<P>
   Values are deep-seated beliefs, and most people inherently
believe that theirs are right, true and appropriate. As many
researchers have found, values are quite stable over time and do
not change quickly or easily. Although there are many examples of
people whose values have changed dramatically, this is often the
result of major life-changing events, and not the result of
constant hounding by a co-worker.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there are even some questions about people who feel the
need to constantly proclaim their values. One wonders if they are
trying to convince others or themselves as to the worth of their
values.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, you should tell this associate that you are not
interested in participating in the debate, but would certainly be
willing to talk with him about other topics, such as work. Whenever
he tries to draw you into a joust of values, do not engage. Doing
so will encourage him. The larger picture is that this is an
individual who has brought a good deal of baggage to work. If he
keeps up the present behavior, he may not even need to unpack. &QL;

EARLY ELECTION RETURNS TROUBLING TO INDONESIA'S RULING PARTY

<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ A top official of Indonesia's ruling party
said on Monday that early returns in national elections suggested
``we are losing'' and that the party would need to fight for a
place in a future government coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all tentative,'' said the official, Marzuki Darusman,
who is a deputy chairman of the party, Golkar. ``But early returns
are indicating that we are sort of trying to stabilize around third
place.''
</P>
<P>
   Such an outcome would turn Indonesian politics upside down after
three decades during which Golkar dominated the nation's political
and administrative life as the obedient tool of former President
Suharto.
</P>
<P>
   But it would not be the end of the struggle for the presidency.
Monday's vote is only the first step in a long process that will
involve coalition-building and closed-door maneuvering in which
Golkar will have the advantages of incumbency and money.
</P>
<P>
   Marzuki's assessment matches fragmentary early returns and
anecdotal information from different parts of the country, as well
as the apparent momentum of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   It also matches the optimistic private soundings of an aide to
Megawati Sukarnoputri, the candidate of the main opposition party,
the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle.
</P>
<P>
   But the official vote tally was coming slowly from around the
country in Indonesia's first free election in more than four
decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nail-biting time,'' said Dewi Fortuna Anwar, a close
adviser to President B.J. Habibie, who is trying to hold on to his
office as the Golkar candidate. ``I don't think we will know for
sure until a few days from now.''
</P>
<P>
   However the vote comes out, she said, ``I feel good. There's a
real celebratory mood here. Before, there was the feeling that you
have to vote a certain line. I hope that, whatever the result, we
continue to have a good mood.''
</P>
<P>
   In a speech on the eve of the vote, Habibie said, ``Maybe it is
no exaggeration if I suggest that the 1999 election is the day of
awakening of democracy in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   If so, he may have to abide by a result that does not make him
happy. Even in his home town, Parepare, in the province of South
Sulawesi, there were signs of trouble for Golkar. The party of the
native son won only 48 percent of the vote, far below local
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   And in the wealthy Jakarta district of Menteng, where Suharto
lives and where he cast his vote on Monday morning one year after
being forced to resign, his neighbors also turned against his
party.
</P>
<P>
   Like the three-week campaign that preceded it, voting throughout
most of the country was notably peaceful. Turnout was mostly high
except for some insecure areas like the province of Aceh, where
separatist guerrillas have tried to disrupt the voting.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes cheering and whooping as returns were tallied in
300,000 polling places around the country, voters seemed thrilled
just to be able to exercise their will without the pressures and
intimidation of past Golkar governments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, the entire mood is different from before,'' said Jani
Dipokusuma, 58, who owns a bookstore in Jakarta. ``There is a sense
of elation and a sense that change has got to come. Before,
everybody had to vote for the ruling party. Not any more.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many other voters interviewed on Monday, he refused to
reveal his choice, hoarding the happy secret of his newly free
vote.
</P>
<P>
   However exhilarating the experience was for the voters, though,
they were choosing just 462 members of a 700-member assembly that
is to select the next president later this year. No party is
expected to win a majority of Monday's votes. And the struggle for
the remaining 238 seats in the electoral assembly _ representatives
of the military, sectoral groups such as religious leaders and
provincial assemblies _ could decide the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are losing, of course, and that's a disappointment,''
Marzuki said. ``But it's not too bad. The system allows a building
of a numerical coalition where the winning party in the election
would be merely the first past the post. There is still some
distance until we get a new government, which may not precisely
reflect the percentage of the vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Most political analysts here have predicted that Golkar would
not place first in Monday's vote but have held out the possibility
that it could still secure the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The first returns on Monday came from Jakarta and surrounding
areas and indicated an expected win in this part of the country for
Mrs. Megawati's party. Golkar's strength lies in the more distant
islands of this far-flung nation of more than 200 million people.
</P>
<P>
   Marzuki said, however, that he had indications that Golkar was
not doing as well as he had hoped.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think for the first time we will have to take into account
the real possibility that they might emerge as a winner and we
might not even make it for the second place,'' he said, referring
to Mrs. Megawati's party.
</P>
<P>
   The future scenario, he said, depends on the final results. But
the scenario he depicted for an eventual Golkar presidency was a
tenuous one.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can get around 25 percent, we still have a good chance
of participating as a lead member of a coalition,'' he said.
``Under certain circumstances we might even end up as president
with the winning party sharing the speakership, for example, as a
compromise.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the party's top official, Akbar Tandjung, publicly
predicted that Golkar would win 40 percent of the vote, well above
the predictions of most political analysts. Privately, Golkar
officials told foreign diplomats that they were expecting to win 30
percent of the vote. That is still a high number in a political
field that has expanded since Suharto was in charge to 48 parties
from just 3.
</P>
<P>
   The difference, and the joy, of this year's vote is its
uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, in the last of Suharto's triumphant five-yearly
self-coronations, Golkar announced more than a month ahead of time
that it would win 70.2 percent of the vote. It was then happy to be
able to report that it had slightly exceeded its target.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like it much better now because you can choose,'' said
Frisdia, 23, a civil servant who voted in the eastern Jakarta
suburb of Tangerang.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, we always knew who would win; it was always solid
yellow,'' he said, referring to the party color of Golkar. ``There
was only one party to choose. So why did we even have elections at
all? It was strange.''

GUNMAN KILLS RADIO AND TELEVISION STAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ A popular television and radio personality often
described as Mexico's Johnny Carson was ambushed and fatally shot
on a Mexico City street Monday morning, numbing his fans and
bringing renewed calls for authorities to clamp down on rampant
crime in the world's largest city.
</P>
<P>
   Francisco ``Paco'' Stanley, 56, was murdered as he was leaving a
restaurant in the southern neighborhood of San Angel after
appearing on his morning television variety show.
</P>
<P>
   Police and witnesses said Stanley and one of his co-hosts, Jorge
Francisco Gil, were shot several times at close range as they got
into Stanley's sport utility vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley died instantly. Gil, 38, was hospitalized in serious but
stable condition with gunshot wounds to his legs. The assailants
fled the scene in a car and were still at large Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   News of the noontime shooting sent waves of grief and anger
across the country, which for the last five years has been plagued
by violent crimes. For more than 20 years, Stanley entertained
Mexicans with his dry, sarcastic wit on the radio and on the
country's two television networks.
</P>
<P>
   The motive for killing was unclear, but investigators voiced
suspicion that the number of shots fired signaled a deliberate hit.
Before being put into an ambulance, Gil reportedly told colleagues
at the television station, Azteca, that ``it was not a robbery.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems clear that the intention was to kill Paco Stanley,
but what we don't know is why,'' Samuel Del Villar, Mexico City's
top prosecutor, told the station Televisa.
</P>
<P>
   Both TV Azteca, which aired Stanley's show, and Televisa, his
previous employer, interrupted regular programming for live reports
throughout the afternoon. Normally composed newscasters shook their
heads in sadness and called for local and federal police officials
to work quickly to solve the crime and stem Mexico's plague of
violence.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley, who was the victim of a gunpoint mugging in December,
reportedly traveled with four bodyguards, but it remained unclear
where they were at the time of the shooting. TV Azteca also
reported that investigators had found at least one gun in Stanley's
car.
</P>
<P>
   There was chaos at the scene of the crime in front of a taco
restaurant. Colleagues and fans wept openly on the street as they
watched puzzled police try to piece the events together.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no reason he should be killed,'' Clara Guzman, 42,
said with tears in her eyes as she stood near the scene. ``He made
us laugh. But no one has any respect for life anymore. This is a
nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   The high-profile murder was sure to put new pressure on both
Mexico City Mayor Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, a presidential candidate for
the 2000 elections, and on President Ernesto Zedillo, who has tried
unsuccessfully to halt the country's crime wave.
</P>
<P>
   The slaying was one of the most sensational killings here since
the 1994 assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio, a leading
presidential candidate, who was shot in the head while campaigning
in Tijuana.
</P>
<P>
   Experts, however, say the current crime surge began with the
country's financial crisis in 1995 and has persisted because of
endemic police corruption and the growing influence of organized
crime and drug cartels.
</P>
<P>
   The violence has hit both affluent and poor.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the son of one of Mexico's most beloved singers,
Vicente Fernandez, was kidnapped and had two fingers chopped off
before his family paid an undisclosed ransom. The father of soccer
goalie Jorge Campos was also kidnapped but later released unharmed
after a ransom was paid. And American boxing promoter Don King was
robbed of a Rolex watch here in March 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The brother of interior minister and presidential candidate
Francisco Labastida Ochoa narrowly escaped a kidnapping attempt
earlier this year. And last week, a driver for another presidential
candidate, Vicente Fox of the conservative National Action Party,
was shot in the chest outside a Mexico City bank.

EAST TIMORESE ARE SUBDUED ON ELECTION DAY
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DILI, East Timor _ East Timorese voters offered a generally
subdued response at the start of voting in Indonesia's national
elections on Monday, with many people saying they were more
concerned about a U.N.-organized vote on self-determination
scheduled for Aug. 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've voted, but this is not important for East Timorese
people,'' said a university graduate who gave his name as Marcos.
``What is important is independence.'' He was among about 400
people at a polling place in Becora, on the outskirts of the
capital, Dili. Becora has been a longtime haven for
pro-independence supporters.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday evening, addressing a candlelit Mass that attracted
10,000 people, Bishop Carlos Belo said in a sermon that East
Timorese should vote in both the election and the referendum
according to their conscience. People should not feel forced to
vote he said. A church official said the bishop would be ``staying
home'' on Monday and would not vote.
</P>
<P>
   Voting outside Dili appeared less relaxed. In Ulmera, in the
troubled Liquica district, about 600 voters waited to vote. The
district is a stronghold of a pro-government militia, and
human-rights groups say voter intimidation has been widespread in
the area.
</P>
<P>
   Voters appeared nervous, but one elderly woman, acknowledging
that militia members were there, said, ``I'm old. I vote for who I
want to.''

INDONESIANS GO TO POLLS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ Closing the curtain on decades of
authoritarian rule, Indonesians voted largely peacefully Monday in
their first free election in 44 years, defying widespread
predictions of violence and taking the first step toward becoming
the world's third-largest democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democracy in Indonesia starts now. I hope this election will
make a new Indonesia, a better Indonesia,'' declared Arif Ridwan,
33, a hotel supervisor in central Jakarta after he proudly dropped
his ballots in locked wooden boxes and dipped his fingertip in
purple dye _ a device to keep people from voting more than once.
``I hope change starts today, because people are very tired of the
old way.''
</P>
<P>
   Ridwan, like two-thirds of the population that was either not
yet born or too young to have voted in the 1955 election, had never
cast a ballot in an open and fair election. Until former President
Suharto was forced out last year after 32 years in power, there
were only three government-approved parties and people were
pressured to vote for Suharto's ruling Golkar party, which always
won.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, 48 parties fielded 11,000 parliamentary candidates,
and there were only isolated reports of coercion or intimidation.
Unregistered voters who were barred from casting ballots burned
three polling boxes in Tangerang, 25 miles west of Jakarta, police
said. In the troubled province of Aceh, some 15,000 people
reportedly fled their homes and were unable to vote following
threats from separatists or the military, a network of university
election monitors reported.
</P>
<P>
   Still, voter turnout was estimated at more than 90 percent, and
there were no reports of injuries or killings.
</P>
<P>
   Yet with results still being tallied Tuesday morning and surveys
predicting that no party will win a majority, the hard work may be
just beginning. A disparate spectrum of parties will be forced to
form coalitions in the new national assembly in order to govern,
and it is possible that tensions will rise if expectations for a
reformist leadership are dashed.
</P>
<P>
   Some election observers also fear that even if voting was
conducted fairly, the results could be falsely reported. Because
the president is not being directly elected _ the national assembly
will choose the president later this year _ the stage may be set
for months of horse-trading, vote-buying, and alliance-breaking
among electors.
</P>
<P>
   Voters cast ballots Monday for 462 elected members of
parliament. The military, excluded from voting, will appoint 38
members. That group of 500 will join 200 government-appointed
assembly members from regional and social groups, and together will
select a president in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of targeting 130 million voters, you're targeting 700
people, and that's where the potential for money politics really
comes out,'' said Charles Costello, director of the democracy
program at the Atlanta-based Carter Center, which sent 100
observers to polling stations Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Carter led a delegation of observers who watched poll
monitors at several stations take an oath of honesty, shake out
ballot boxes to prove they were empty, and check the count of
ballots.
</P>
<P>
   Much is at stake for Indonesia's 210 million people. For
decades, Suharto's party muzzled and jailed its opponents and
gagged the press, even as it was accused of massive corruption and
abuse of power in the world's fourth-most populous nation. In the
last year, President B.J. Habibie, who replaced Suharto when his
mentor was ousted from power, has launched several overhauls,
including freeing many political prisoners and discussing
independence for the disputed territory of East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for many, the only acceptable outcome would be a thumping
defeat for Golkar _ something that is not guaranteed, especially in
remote, rural areas where people have known of nothing else and may
have limited information about newer parties. Election observers
worry if Golkar does better than expected and cheating is
suspected, frustrated voters may lash out.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary results early Tuesday showed opposition candidate
Megawati Sukarnoputri's Indonesian Democratic Party for Struggle
ahead with 55 percent of the vote, with Golkar next with 21
percent. But that reflected just 17,500 votes out of an estimated
118 million ballots cast.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, however, the mood among voters was expectant, calm
and optimistic. On a soccer field in Rempoa village in the province
of West Java, voters waited patiently in chairs for an hour before
polls opened, beneath a hand-painted banner declaring, ``Go to Hell
with Money Politics!'' Most declined to say who they were voting
for, reminding questioners with a smile that the ballot was secret
and that for the first time, they were free to choose whom they
wanted without fear.
</P>
<P>
   Aisah, 21, a clerk, recalled that in the last election, her high
school teachers said she had to vote for Golkar or she wouldn't
graduate. ``Golkar came to my school and gave computers, so we were
told we must choose them. Too many people were scared to do
anything else. But now I'm free,'' she smiled.

UNDATED: made a difference. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``It was like instant, overnight success,'' he said.
``Everything went from mediocre to pretty up there.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of his junior year, Endsley wanted to take on the
pommel horse, an event that takes considerable abdominal and
upper-body strength to support complicated leg swings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because he has part of his upper leg, he could control that on
the pommel horse and imitate doing scissors,'' Gonzalez said.
</P>
<P>
   During his senior year, Endsley earned 10s, the highest score,
on parallel bars and rings in his compulsory routines. He also
began doing double back-flip dismounts off the high bar and rings
and landing them with a deep knee bend, and an occasional hop.
</P>
<P>
   Driven by the dream of competing in the all-around, Endsley
decided to try vault and floor routines two months before the
district meet this year. He learned to tumble and vault, taking
several hops to generate speed instead of running. On the floor, he
learned how to hop his way into the same actions used by two-legged
gymnasts.
</P>
<P>
   Mustering enough force on the springboard to fly over the vault
in a handspring position was the biggest challenge Endsley faced,
he said. But he kept working at it with Gonzalez's encouragement
and succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone told him, `Why do this? You're already winning with
your three events,''' said Dominguez, who also competed in the
all-around. ``He said, `Because I can do it.' People said, `I don't
think you can do floor. And what are you going to do, hop your way
to vault?' But Chance said he was going to get everything he could
out of his situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chance boldly went where no one-legged man had gone before.
That's courage. That's heart. That's what makes him special.''
</P>
<P>
   With a strong all-around performance at the district meet this
spring, Endsley qualified for the Region III championships in the
all-around _ his personal goal. Although his performance at
regionals fell short of earning him a berth in the all-around at
state, he took the Region III parallel bars title, qualifying for
state in that event for the second consecutive year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am beside myself,'' Tana Samford said. ``I never, ever
thought seven years ago, I never knew there would be so much he
could do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm speechless every time'' he does any of his events.
</P>
<P>
   At the state competition, Endsley's performances showcased his
playful spirit. He learned to loosen up and play off the crowd,
grinning as he prepared to compete.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started to realize, after 10 years of training, if I don't
have it now, there's no sense worrying about it,'' he said. ``So I
just decided to go out there and have a good time, and it worked
great for me.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd at the Abilene High School gymnasium would hush amid
the commotion of several simultaneous events to focus on Endsley.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's known statewide, and I don't think he knows half the
people who know him,'' Dominguez said. ``When he competed at state,
everyone was saying, `Chance is going,' `Shhhh, Chance is going,'
`Hey, be quiet. Chance is going.' Even the competitors themselves
don't salute the judge (to begin their routines) until they see
Chance go.''
</P>
<P>
   Endsley finished third in the parallel bars with a three-day
score of 28.925. But when awards were given at the end of the meet,
Endsley took home more than a bronze medal.
</P>
<P>
   He was selected by the Texas High School Gymnastics Coaches
Association for the new Spirit of Courage Award, which the
association has said will not be given unless it is truly deserved.
</P>
<P>
   ``That really hit home,'' Endsley said. ``I was the first person
to ever receive the award, so that made it even more special.''
</P>
<P>
   He also was selected by the association to compete on Team
Texas, a group of seniors who participated last month in the
National High School Gymnastics Championships in Lincoln, Neb. His
performance on parallel bars helped the boys team to its seventh
consecutive national championship, and he earned fourth place in
the parallel bars finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chance is a role model for everybody, for the country,'' said
Trinity High School gymnast Aaron Jackson, Endsley's Team Texas
teammate. ``People stub their toe and get down on themselves. Well,
he lost a leg, and he never gave up.''
</P>
<P>
   Although gymnastics became his love and his life the past seven
years, Endsley plans to attend University of Texas of the Permian
Basin in Odessa in the fall to concentrate on academics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew if I went to OU, gymnastics would be there, and there'd
be no way I'd be able to stay out of it,'' he said. ``I decided I
wasn't going to put myself in that situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Endsley said he is determined to be an orthopedic surgeon so he
can help people similar to himself.He said he will miss gymnastics
but hopes that his time in the sport will leave a lasting
impression.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope people who saw me compete think, `Hey, if he can do it,
then I can do it. Maybe my problems aren't as bad as I thought.' ''

<P>
   Watching Chance Endsley compete in varsity gymnastics is a wild
ride down an emotional superhighway.
</P>
<P>
   Shock: ``Oh my gosh. He only has one leg.''
</P>
<P>
   Awe: ``Wait a minute. He's really good.''
</P>
<P>
   Fear: ``OK. There is no way he's landing on one leg.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Endsley nails the landing.
</P>
<P>
   On one leg.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't anticipate what he's about to do because they
don't know the person,'' said Gustavo Dominguez, Endsley's best
friend and a teammate at Odessa High School in West Texas. They
both graduated recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is an icon of courage.''
</P>
<P>
   Endsley's courage helped take him to the state and national
gymnastics meets as a senior _ seven years after he lost his right
leg in a freak accident.
</P>
<P>
   Endsley, then 11, was on a family trip to Sheffield, about 90
miles southeast of Odessa in a hilly region of the West Texas oil
patch. He and his siblings and cousins were pushing large rocks off
the mountainside when one of the rocks, ``about the size of a
Volkswagen,'' rolled back onto Endsley's leg, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The rock shattered his leg, breaking bones in 16 places and
leaving him bleeding profusely.
</P>
<P>
   His stepfather, Gary Samford, who was a medic in the Navy,
fashioned a makeshift stretcher and kept Endsley conscious while
they drove to a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the only thing keeping me from dying,'' Endsley said.
``He made me stay awake all the way down to Iraan'' just north of
Sheffield.
</P>
<P>
   ``I died in the hospital. They had to bring me back.''
</P>
<P>
   For 11 days, doctors tried to save Endsley's leg. Then Endsley
decided he had had enough. He told the doctor to amputate his leg,
said his mother, Tana Samford.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor gave Endsley a marker and told him to draw a line on
his leg where he still had feeling, and the leg was amputated from
that point _ his upper thigh _ the next morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you ever been in the hospital 11 days, where you're just
being drugged and in pain and everything else?'' Endsley said. ``I
was tired of it. It was the best way out. It was the only way out.
It wasn't going to be saved.''
</P>
<P>
   After the surgery, Endsley developed a blood yeast infection, a
condition that Endsley was later told is survived by 10 percent of
patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never knew anything was wrong with me,'' he said. ``People
would come in with a big smile on their face. I had no idea I only
had a 10 percent chance of living.''
</P>
<P>
   After being hospitalized about two months, Endsley went home. He
had already accepted his loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandma came in (the hospital room) and asked me, `Your leg
is gone. Aren't you upset?' I said, `No. It doesn't do any good to
be upset. It won't make it grow back,''' Endsley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when I decided to make the best of what I had.''
</P>
<P>
   He returned to school to start sixth grade on crutches, happy to
be back after missing the last month of fifth grade. During the
next three months, he learned to walk with a prosthesis.
</P>
<P>
   That year, he returned to gymnastics, which he had enjoyed
before the accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``My coach said, `Why don't you try it again?''' Endsley said.
``I didn't think I had much of a chance at it. But I gave it a
shot. And I'm glad I gave it another shot.''
</P>
<P>
   In seventh grade, Endsley began competing while wearing his
prosthesis, under the tutelage of Odessa High gymnastics coach Tony
Gonzalez, who said he had never turned away a student with a
disability.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw Chance as a challenge, to see how far he was going to
get and how much I was going to be able to teach him,'' Gonzalez
said. ``The first year was a trial, but I could see, even now when
I see video, there was improvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``More so than any other team member at the time, I could see a
difference in him, a difference in him trying to learn and excel.
So when I saw that desire, I said, `We can do something here.'''
</P>
<P>
   Endsley said he never won an event while wearing his prosthesis,
although he did not do poorly. The highest he placed was third on
the parallel bars in a dual meet in junior high school, and he said
the competition in junior high was not that strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``His prosthesis got in the way on landings and swings,''
Gonzalez said. ``He didn't have total control of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, a physics teacher, wondered about Endsley competing
without his prosthesis. Toward the end of Endsley's sophomore year,
Gonzalez persuaded him to try it.
</P>
<P>
   With clearance from Endsley's parents and his doctor, Gonzalez
and Endsley embarked on a scientific and physical challenge. To
perform forceful, flipping dismounts on events such as the high
bar, Endsley would need to absorb a great impact on one leg. His
doctor said Endsley's leg could handle it.
</P>
<P>
   ``From there, I said, `OK, Chance. Now we've got to condition
that leg,''' Gonzalez said. ``That was going to be the critical
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez stacked mats in the weight room and had Endsley jump on
and off them to strengthen his leg muscles. Endsley also did more
squats than he could count.
</P>
<P>
   He soon found his routines running more smoothly on parallel
bars, rings and high bar. He isn't sure why, he said, but the
freedom from his prosthesis clearly made a difference.

<P>
   Watching Chance Endsley compete in varsity gymnastics is a wild
ride down an emotional superhighway.
</P>
<P>
   Shock: ``Oh my gosh. He only has one leg.''
</P>
<P>
   Awe: ``Wait a minute. He's really good.''
</P>
<P>
   Fear: ``OK. There is no way he's landing on one leg.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Endsley nails the landing.
</P>
<P>
   On one leg.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't anticipate what he's about to do because they
don't know the person,'' said Gustavo Dominguez, Endsley's best
friend and a teammate at Odessa High School in West Texas. They
both graduated recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is an icon of courage.''
</P>
<P>
   Endsley's courage helped take him to the state and national
gymnastics meets as a senior _ seven years after he lost his right
leg in a freak accident.
</P>
<P>
   Endsley, then 11, was on a family trip to Sheffield, about 90
miles southeast of Odessa in a hilly region of the West Texas oil
patch. He and his siblings and cousins were pushing large rocks off
the mountainside when one of the rocks, ``about the size of a
Volkswagen,'' rolled back onto Endsley's leg, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The rock shattered his leg, breaking bones in 16 places and
leaving him bleeding profusely.
</P>
<P>
   His stepfather, Gary Samford, who was a medic in the Navy,
fashioned a makeshift stretcher and kept Endsley conscious while
they drove to a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the only thing keeping me from dying,'' Endsley said.
``He made me stay awake all the way down to Iraan'' just north of
Sheffield.
</P>
<P>
   ``I died in the hospital. They had to bring me back.''
</P>
<P>
   For 11 days, doctors tried to save Endsley's leg. Then Endsley
decided he had had enough. He told the doctor to amputate his leg,
said his mother, Tana Samford.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor gave Endsley a marker and told him to draw a line on
his leg where he still had feeling, and the leg was amputated from
that point _ his upper thigh _ the next morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you ever been in the hospital 11 days, where you're just
being drugged and in pain and everything else?'' Endsley said. ``I
was tired of it. It was the best way out. It was the only way out.
It wasn't going to be saved.''
</P>
<P>
   After the surgery, Endsley developed a blood yeast infection, a
condition that Endsley was later told is survived by 10 percent of
patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never knew anything was wrong with me,'' he said. ``People

MANDELA'S PARTY WINS 266 OF 400 SEATS IN SOUTH AFRICA

<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ Final election results in South
Africa show that the ruling African National Congress was returned
to power with even more votes than it won in 1994. But it fell just
one seat short of a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Five days after the country held its second post-apartheid
elections, its Independent Election Commission announced Monday
that it had finished counting and verifying the nearly 16 million
votes cast last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   According to commission figures, the ANC won 266 of Parliament's
400 seats. The liberal Democratic Party had the next-highest total,
with 38 seats, followed by the Zulu-nationalist Inkatha Freedom
Party, with 34 seats, and the Afrikaner-led New National Party,
with 28 seats.
</P>
<P>
   The newly formed United Democratic Movement, headed by Bantu
Holomisa, a former ANC official who was ejected from the party for
insubordination, got 14 seats. All told, 13 parties are to have
seats in South Africa's next Parliament, about twice as many as in
1994, though they will have 14 fewer seats between them.
</P>
<P>
   At the ceremony announcing the final count, South Africa's next
president, Thabo Mbeki, pledged that democracy was ``here to stay''
in South Africa. Mbeki, 56, currently deputy president, who was the
ANC's only candidate for president, borrowed from Yeats, saying:
``There were many in our country and elsewhere who thought that
things would fall apart, that the center could not hold.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mbeki, who is expected to take office on June 16, added that
it did hold: ``It has held in favor of democracy and of the people
of South Africa.''
</P>
<P>
   ANC officials started off the campaign season saying they wanted
a two-thirds majority so they could consider changing some aspects
of the constitution. But whn opposition parties focused their
campaigns on warning the electorate of the ANC's plans, the party's
officials began downplaying the goal.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Mbeki has dismissed its importance, saying he
had no plans to change the constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Some political analysts said that the failure to win two-thirds
of the Parliament's seats might be a blessing in disguise for the
party.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are saved from the internal struggles that might have
cropped up if they had the two-thirds majority,'' said Shaun
Mackay, a researcher with the nonprofit Center for Policy Studies.
</P>
<P>
   The ANC's victory was overwhelming, not only in the national
election, but in the nine provincial elections as well. It failed
to win a clear majority in only two provinces, the Western Cape,
which includes Cape Town, and KwaZulu/Natal, which includes Durban
and is the heartland of the Inkatha Freedom Party.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations over coalitions between various parties have
already begun.
</P>
<P>
   Several newspapers have reported that the ANC is offering
Inkatha's leader, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, the job of deputy
president in exchange for control over who will be the premiere of
the KwaZulu/Natal province.
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki seemed to give his strongest public signal yet that he
would name Buthelezi in his Cabinet to be announced next week.
</P>
<P>
   He called Buthelezi up to the stage from where he was sitting
with his Inkatha colleagues, saying jokingly, ``I want to take him
out of the IFP and put him in government.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the South African Press Association, Buthelezi
denied Monday night that he had been offered the deputy presidency.
On whether he would accept the post if it was offered, he replied:
``That is like saying if you were offered a box of chocolates,
would you eat them?''
</P>
<P>
   The ANC and Inkatha have been rivals for more than a decade.
Before the 1994 elections more than 10,000 people died in fighting
between the two sides. But in recent years, the two parties have
been trying to work together and Buthelezi has filled in as
president whenever President Nelson Mandela and Mbeki were out of
the country at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Although some areas of Kwazulu/Natal were tense during the
election campaign, violence was minimal.

UNDATED: made a difference. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``It was like instant, overnight success,'' he said.
``Everything went from mediocre to pretty up there.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of his junior year, Endsley wanted to take on the
pommel horse, an event that takes considerable abdominal and
upper-body strength to support complicated leg swings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because he has part of his upper leg, he could control that on
the pommel horse and imitate doing scissors,'' Gonzalez said.
</P>
<P>
   During his senior year, Endsley earned 10s, the highest score,
on parallel bars and rings in his compulsory routines. He also
began doing double back-flip dismounts off the high bar and rings
and landing them with a deep knee bend, and an occasional hop.
</P>
<P>
   Driven by the dream of competing in the all-around, Endsley
decided to try vault and floor routines two months before the
district meet this year. He learned to tumble and vault, taking
several hops to generate speed instead of running. On the floor, he
learned how to hop his way into the same actions used by two-legged
gymnasts.
</P>
<P>
   Mustering enough force on the springboard to fly over the vault
in a handspring position was the biggest challenge Endsley faced,
he said. But he kept working at it with Gonzalez's encouragement
and succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone told him, `Why do this? You're already winning with
your three events,''' said Dominguez, who also competed in the
all-around. ``He said, `Because I can do it.' People said, `I don't
think you can do floor. And what are you going to do, hop your way
to vault?' But Chance said he was going to get everything he could
out of his situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chance boldly went where no one-legged man had gone before.
That's courage. That's heart. That's what makes him special.''
</P>
<P>
   With a strong all-around performance at the district meet this
spring, Endsley qualified for the Region III championships in the
all-around _ his personal goal. Although his performance at
regionals fell short of earning him a berth in the all-around at
state, he took the Region III parallel bars title, qualifying for
state in that event for the second consecutive year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am beside myself,'' Tana Samford said. ``I never, ever
thought seven years ago, I never knew there would be so much he
could do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm speechless every time'' he does any of his events.
</P>
<P>
   At the state competition, Endsley's performances showcased his
playful spirit. He learned to loosen up and play off the crowd,
grinning as he prepared to compete.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started to realize, after 10 years of training, if I don't
have it now, there's no sense worrying about it,'' he said. ``So I
just decided to go out there and have a good time, and it worked
great for me.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd at the Abilene High School gymnasium would hush amid
the commotion of several simultaneous events to focus on Endsley.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's known statewide, and I don't think he knows half the
people who know him,'' Dominguez said. ``When he competed at state,
everyone was saying, `Chance is going,' `Shhhh, Chance is going,'
`Hey, be quiet. Chance is going.' Even the competitors themselves
don't salute the judge (to begin their routines) until they see
Chance go.''
</P>
<P>
   Endsley finished third in the parallel bars with a three-day
score of 28.925. But when awards were given at the end of the meet,
Endsley took home more than a bronze medal.
</P>
<P>
   He was selected by the Texas High School Gymnastics Coaches
Association for the new Spirit of Courage Award, which the
association has said will not be given unless it is truly deserved.
</P>
<P>
   ``That really hit home,'' Endsley said. ``I was the first person
to ever receive the award, so that made it even more special.''
</P>
<P>
   He also was selected by the association to compete on Team
Texas, a group of seniors who participated last month in the
National High School Gymnastics Championships in Lincoln, Neb. His
performance on parallel bars helped the boys team to its seventh
consecutive national championship, and he earned fourth place in
the parallel bars finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chance is a role model for everybody, for the country,'' said
Trinity High School gymnast Aaron Jackson, Endsley's Team Texas
teammate. ``People stub their toe and get down on themselves. Well,
he lost a leg, and he never gave up.''
</P>
<P>
   Although gymnastics became his love and his life the past seven
years, Endsley plans to attend University of Texas of the Permian
Basin in Odessa in the fall to concentrate on academics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew if I went to OU, gymnastics would be there, and there'd
be no way I'd be able to stay out of it,'' he said. ``I decided I
wasn't going to put myself in that situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Endsley said he is determined to be an orthopedic surgeon so he
can help people similar to himself.He said he will miss gymnastics
but hopes that his time in the sport will leave a lasting
impression.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope people who saw me compete think, `Hey, if he can do it,
then I can do it. Maybe my problems aren't as bad as I thought.' ''

NATO HOLDS BACK ON THREATENED BOMBING OF BELGRADE
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ NATO held back most of Monday on carrying
out threats to intensify its bombing of Yugoslavia if Belgrade did
not promptly accept allied terms on Kosovo. Allied officials said
they hoped that the restraint would help persuade Russia to back a
U.N. Security Council resolution on ending the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Still confident that President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia
would finally be forced to withdraw from Kosovo, the allies kept
pounding his army overnight Sunday, hitting about 50 armored
vehicles. But they did not strike the capital, Belgrade, or other
sensitive targets on Monday as long as negotiations on the
resolution continued near Bonn, Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Led by France, the continental European allies moderated
American and British outrage over the refusal by Yugoslav military
commanders on Sunday night to accept NATO military terms despite
Milosevic's agreement in principle last week to pull out 40,000
troops from Kosovo and let security forces and ethnic Albanian
refugees in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we finalize a draft resolution in talks with the Russians
and get it approved by the Security Council, then we can go ahead
with heavier strikes if Milosevic still refuses,'' a French
official in Paris said.
</P>
<P>
   President Jacques Chirac feared that Russia might balk in talks
at a conference center outside Bonn on Monday if the allies resumed
blasting targets all over Yugoslavia and in Belgrade with more than
300 bombing runs a day, as they were doing until last week.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov of Russia agreed to attend the
talks in Bonn only after Chirac called President Boris Yeltsin over
the weekend and pleaded with him to let Ivanov travel on Monday,
the French official said.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting of allied ambassadors here, American and British
representatives did not object to this European strategy for
keeping the Russians engaged in the diplomacy, officials said.
Though officials left the intensity of the bombing up to NATO
Secretary General Javier Solana and the top allied commander, U.S.
Gen. Wesley Clark, no big step-up in the bombing was evident while
talks continued in Bonn.
</P>
<P>
   There, the allies hoped, Ivanov, Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright and their counterparts from Britain and France, both also
permanent members of the Security Council, and the four other
countries attending would reach agreement on a draft resolution.
The allies also hoped that China would go along, giving Milosevic
no choice but to do what the resolution said and withdraw the
troops.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, the allies have pledged continued resolve to keep up
the bombing, which began its 76th day on Monday, and heaped scorn
on the Yugoslav leader for going back on his word. But the allies
also said they were confident that their firmness would soon allow
them to prevail.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still believe we've come a very, very long way in these 75
days,'' said NATO spokesman Jamie Shea. But he put off a champagne
celebration he had planned for Monday, letting the hordes of
journalists who cover NATO lunch off the cocktail sandwiches that
he had apparently ordered for a party Monday afternoon.

 BRUSSELS, Belgium: Monday afternoon.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   British Defense Minister George Robertson accused Milosevic of
``bad faith'' and ``procedural trickery.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Milosevic is trying to cull elements of victory out of the
defeat that last week's agreement represented,'' he said in London.
``We have moderated the air campaign in the last few days. They
will feel pain again.''
</P>
<P>
   But the alliance, which early Monday said that air operations
were ``accelerating toward their prior intensity,'' took its foot
off the accelerator, officials said, to give the foreign ministers
a chance to reach an agreement in Bonn.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanov did not arrive in a conciliatory mood, accusing NATO of
going beyond military issues in the weekend talks with the Yugoslav
military. ``NATO is trying unilaterally to say in this document
that an international force will be based on NATO units and have
the right to use force,'' Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
   Russia wants security forces to be under U.N. command and has
refused to discuss participating in any NATO security mission,
allied officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Russia also seemed to agree with a Yugoslav demand that allied
diplomats said had scuttled the military talks on Sunday in
Macedonia. The Yugoslav officers insisted that the 45,000 security
troops planned by the allies could enter Kosovo only if the
Security Council gave them a mandate to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Security Council, in line with the political agreement and
principles set out in Belgrade, is the only institution in charge
of scope, modalities and mandate of an international presence in
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia,'' a spokesman for the Yugoslav
Foreign Ministry, Nebojsa Vujovic, said Monday in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Allied diplomats said the Yugoslav commanders had also gone back
on Milosevic's pledge to Russian and European Union mediators on
Thursday in Belgrade that all 40,000 Serbian military, paramilitary
and police troops in Kosovo would withdraw when the international
community took over administration.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Foreign Secretary Robin Cook of Britain said Monday on
BBC Television that the Serbs had said that ``for the time being''
they wanted to withdraw their troops only to what they called
``peacetime levels.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That could mean them keeping 10,000 to 15,000 troops in
Kosovo,'' Cook said. ``Well, that's a nonstarter.''
</P>
<P>
   The British lieutenant general who will command NATO operations
in Kosovo, Sir Michael Jackson, rejected that proposal in his talks
over the weekend in Macedonia with the Yugoslav officers, allied
diplomats said. Sir Michael also turned down Yugoslav requests for
more than seven days to complete their withdrawal and more than 48
hours to deactivate their air defenses so that allied planes could
monitor the Serbian pullout, both parts of the agreement in
principle that former Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin of Russia
and President Martti Ahtisaari of Finland worked out with Milosevic
on Thursday in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian officers also made other attempts to go back on the
agreement, allied diplomats said. They wanted NATO forces, not the
retreating Serbs, to be responsible for clearing land mines from
Kosovo, according to allied officials. They also wanted to permit
only refugees with proof of citizenship to return to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   About 850,000 of 1.8 million ethnic Albanians have been driven
out of the province this year, and thousands said Serbian
authorities had confiscated and destroyed their citizenship and
identity papers before pushing the refugees into Albania and
Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The demands of the international community remain the only way
to guarantee the safe return of the refugees to their homes,'' Shea
said. ``General Jackson remains in the former Yugoslav republic of
Macedonia and is fully ready to discuss concrete implementation of
the Chernomyrdin-Ahtisaari agreement whenever the Serbs are ready.
The flap of his tent remains open.''
</P>
<P>
   General Jackson called off the talks with two Yugoslav generals
late Sunday night after the Serbs had balked at the agreement. But
officials said that lower-ranking officers from both sides had
established contact and that talks could resume any time.
</P>
<P>
   Before the talks Monday in Bonn, NATO planes flew more than 480
missions, down from 700 and more earlier last week, when the
weather was clear. The bombing continued Monday, with missile
strikes on Jagodina and Dobricevo in Serbia, the state-run Tanjug
news agency reported in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   But for the moment, most of the allied strikes appeared to be
concentrated on Serbian positions in Kosovo near the Albanian
border, where Serbian forces have been engaged in heavy fighting
with ethnic Albanian rebels from the Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy bombing by American B-52s continued for the second day in
a row there, reports from the field said. Despite the pounding,
Serbian forces fired artillery at rebel bases across the border in
Albania on Sunday and kept up heavy fighting against rebel
positions just inside the province and near the Pagarusa Valley
town of Orahovac, said a military command spokesman, Maj. Gen.
Walter Jertz.

 &HT;    Carter Center joins mental health debate
 &HT;    By Patricia Guthrie
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Teenagers and tornadoes, communities and crisis were
among the diverse range of topics discussed Monday during the
Carter Center's contribution to the White House Conference on
Mental Health.
</P>
<P>
   Via satellite feed, Georgia therapists, activists, behavioral
scientists and high school students listened to Vice President Al
Gore, his wife, Tipper, and first lady Hillary Clinton discuss the
importance in making mental health issues a part of comprehensive
health care and a part of household, school and church
conversations.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Surgeon General David Satcher led the panel discussions at
the Carter Center, along with Jane Delgado, president of the
National Coalition of Hispanic Health and a Carter Center mental
health task force member.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mental health is everybody's business,'' Satcher said. ``And
there should be community health centers that promote strong mental
health programs so the community knows `We're here for you,' and to
not be afraid to seek help.''
</P>
<P>
   Doris Smith spoke about losing her son, Mark Alan, when he
committed suicide at age 27, and how the suicide rate among young
African-American men continues to rise. ``For many reasons, the
African-American community will not discuss suicide,'' she said.
``It's a taboo subject in our churches, and among many people. I
know there are suicide survivors in Atlanta who will not come
forward and talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith now actively works with Georgia Survivors of Suicide, the
national Suicide Prevention Advocacy Network and Project HOPE, a
Georgia project to train leaders in the African-American community
about depression. At the Carter Center, her son's photo and song
lyrics were among many faces displayed on the Georgia Lifekeeper
Memory Quilt dedicated to those who had taken their own lives.
</P>
<P>
   On everyone's mind were troubled teenagers in the wake of recent
school shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Before the conference began, Satcher met privately with 20
Atlanta-area high school students in a roundtable discussion. They
talked about threats of violence at their schools, and the fear
that teenagers have in coming forward to talk about emotional
stress and problems at home.
</P>
<P>
   Vernon Veneno, a panelist from Dulce, N.M., who listened in,
offered one solution he's seen work in the small 3,000-population
Jicarilla Apache community of Dulce. Responding to suicide rates
that were twice the national average, the community borrowed a peer
program from Seattle called Natural Helpers in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Dulce High School surveyed its students and asked what peer they
felt comfortable talking to about home problems, alcohol, drugs,
thoughts of suicide and other issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody picked someone within their own group they could go
to and tell them, `My dad's been drinking again,' or `I feel like
going on and getting drunk,''' Veneno said.
</P>
<P>
   After five years of Natural Helpers at Dulce's middle and high
schools, the number of suicides dropped. ``It used to be two, three
or four kids killing themselves every year,'' Veneno said. ``But
since 1995, there's been only two completed suicides.''
</P>
<P>
   Crisis counseling in the aftermath of Dunwoody, Ga.'s 1998
tornado and the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing were also addressed at
the meeting.

JUSTICES FIND SHORTCUTS TO FEDERAL APPEALS BY STATE INMATES
UNACCEPTABLE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill.) (sw) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court on Monday shut the door tighter
on state inmates' access to federal court, ruling that prisoners
who have not first appealed to their state's highest court forfeit
their right to federal court review even if it was evident that the
state appeal would be fruitless.
</P>
<P>
   Under the federal law governing habeas corpus _ constitutional
review of a conviction or sentence _ a state inmate must first
``have exhausted the remedies available in the courts of the
state'' before seeking a federal court's assistance. The question
for the justices today, in a case from Illinois, was whether the
available remedies that must first be exhausted include an appeal
to a state high court where the criteria for selecting cases make
it virtually certain that the inmate's case will not even be heard.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-to-3 decision overturned a ruling by the 7th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals, in Chicago. That court held last year that
because the Illinois Supreme Court's rules were clearly intended to
discourage the filing of routine criminal appeals, it would be
unfair to penalize prisoners who try to follow those rules by going
directly to federal court. In 1997, the Illinois Supreme Court
reviewed only 33 of 1,072 criminal cases, a ratio roughly similar
to the justices' own rate of granting cases.
</P>
<P>
   All convicted defendants in Illinois are guaranteed the right to
an initial appeal before an intermediate court. The inmate in this
case, Darren Boerckel, a convicted rapist, had raised six issues
for appeal before the intermediate court, but presented only three
of them to the Illinois Supreme Court. The 7th Circuit ruled that
the Federal District Court in Peoria could nonetheless consider all
six.
</P>
<P>
   Writing for the majority on Monday, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor
said that as a matter of federal-state relations, as long as a
state has given its supreme court the choice to review a case,
federal courts should require that state inmates make use of the
available process so that the state court has a chance to exercise
its discretionary jurisdiction. Any issues not raised in the state
supreme court should be considered defaulted, she said. If the
state declines to hear a case, the inmate can then appeal to
federal court.
</P>
<P>
   The principle O'Connor invoked was the doctrine of ``comity,''
an aspect of federalism meaning that the federal government should
respect state institutions. ``This rule of comity reduces friction
between the state and Federal court systems by avoiding the
unseemliness of a Federal district court's overturning a state
court conviction without the state courts having had an opportunity
to correct the constitutional violation in the first instance,''
O'Connor said.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly 20 years, the court has been invoking federalism
principles to cut back on the federal courts' ability, through
granting writs of habeas corpus, to review the quality of justice
being administered by the states.
</P>
<P>
   But the dissenters on Monday, Justices John Paul Stevens,
Stephen B. Breyer and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, objected that comity
really supported the opposite result in this case, O'Sullivan vs.
Boerckel, No. 97-2048. If a state high court made it clear that it
did not want to be burdened with routine appeals, Stevens said in
an opinion the other two dissenters also signed, then federal
courts should not adopt a rule that has the effect of forcing
inmates to add to this unwanted burden.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most ironically,'' Stevens said, the court's decision ``will
undermine federalism by thwarting the interests of those state
supreme courts that administer discretionary dockets.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor's majority opinion was joined by Chief Justice William
H. Rehnquist and by Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy,
Clarence Thomas and David H. Souter. Souter also wrote a concurring
opinion to say that state supreme courts could insulate themselves
from the impact of the decision by issuing more precise rules about
the kinds of appeals they wanted to deflect to the federal courts
and did not want to hear themselves.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As the court's momentum seemed to flag with less than a month to
go in term, there were also these other developments on Monday:
</P>
<P>
   _ The court ruled that federal laws dating to early in the
century, which gave the government ownership of coal found under
millions of acres of Western land, did not apply to the methane gas
that is also found in the coal beds. The property owners own the
gas, Kennedy said in a 7-to-1 opinion. Ginsburg dissented and
Breyer did not participate.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, Amoco Production Co. vs. Southern Ute Tribe, No.
98-830, was a victory for a group of energy producers who owned the
lands. It overturned a ruling by the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals, in Denver. The government argued unsuccessfully that the
Coal Lands Acts of 1909 and 1910 reserved to itself both coal and
gas. Kennedy said that was not the intent of Congress, because
methane gas was seen at the time as a dangerous and unwanted
byproduct, only much later acquiring economic value.
</P>
<P>
   The Southern Ute tribe had been granted the coal rights by the
government and had been seeking ownership of the gas as well.
</P>
<P>
   _Acting on an appeal by a Nevada death-row inmate who committed
a double murder in 1993 at age 16, the court asked the Clinton
administration for its views on the issue the inmate raised:
whether Nevada is bound by an international treaty the United
States has signed that bars executing those who committed their
crimes before age 18.
</P>
<P>
   President Jimmy Carter signed the International Covenant on
Civil and Political Rights in 1977. When the Senate ratified it in
1992, it attached a ``reservation,'' at the urging of President
George Bush, declining to accept the capital punishment provision.
An additional question raised by Michael Domingues, the inmate in
this case, Domingues vs. Nevada, No. 98-8327, is whether that
action was valid. The treaty has been signed by 144 countries.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court ruled in 1989 that it did not violate the
Constitution to execute someone who had killed at age 16.
</P>
<P>
   The Nevada Supreme Court upheld the death sentence in this case
in 1996. Subsequently, lawyers for Domingues filed a new appeal
seeking a ``correction of illegal sentence.'' The Nevada Supreme
Court rejected that appeal last year by a 3-to-2 vote.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's views, expected next fall, are not binding
on the Court, which will eventually make its own decision, if it
chooses to hear the case.

YUGOSLAV GENERALS ARE SAID TO STALL FOR UN ROLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE _ Yugoslav Army generals who refuse to sign an
agreement for their withdrawal from Kosovo are buying time so they
can hand over control of the Serbian province to the United Nations
instead of NATO, political and military analysts here say.
</P>
<P>
   Those analysts say the generals are acting on the orders of
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, who in order to stay in
power needs to portray his capitulation as a victory by pushing
NATO aside and getting the UN to take over peacekeeping operations
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But to do that, Milosevic needs a Security Council resolution
that would spell out that the UN will oversee the international
peacekeepers, which will include NATO troops. Efforts to draw up
and submit that resolution to the UN will resume Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   After the talks broke down, NATO on Monday night started bombing
the capital, Belgrade, for the first time in five days, a lull that
had been interpreted here as a good-will gesture.
</P>
<P>
   The refusal of Yugoslav generals to sign the six-page document
that stipulates the withdrawal of 40,000 Serb troops from Kosovo
had been seen by some as a split between the army and the
government in Belgrade. Some have even suggested the generals'
refusal to accept the terms that Milosevic and the Serbian
parliament had approved Thursday as having the makings of a
potential coup.
</P>
<P>
   But both political and military analysts said that Milosevic
remains committed to ending the war based on the principles
outlined by the Group of Eight industrialized nations and Russia,
and that the military remains loyal to the regime.
</P>
<P>
   The United States asked the Security Council to schedule a
meeting Monday to approve a resolution to end the war over Kosovo,
but the G-8 foreign ministers were unable to agree on the language.
Negotiations are scheduled to resume Tuesday in Bonn, with the
Russians arguing on behalf of the Serbs. The Russians are demanding
an immediate halt to the bombing, and could use their veto on the
Security Council as leverage.
</P>
<P>
   However, National Security Council spokesman David Leavysaid
there was ``substantial progress'' Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The talks haven't broken down. There's still mil-to-mil talks
in Macedonia, and the G-8 ministers meeting in Bonn. We always said
we had to be cautious here, but they're making substantial process,
going over in detail what the elements of the agreement are,
synchronizing various steps. We're going to keep at this until we
find a solution.''
</P>
<P>
   President Martti Ahtisaari of Finland, who helped persuade
Milosevic to accept the deal last week, said Milosevic had assured
him Monday by telephone that he intended to honor the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin spoke
Monday for about 10 minutes, going over the remaining
disagreements. They agreed the Ahtisaari-Chernomyrdin agreement
should be the basis of the settlement. Leavy said there is ``no
question'' Yeltsin supports the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Goran Matic, a spokesman for the Yugoslav government, gave an
upbeat assessment Monday, saying that a Security Council resolution
would resolve the stalemate.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview at his Belgrade home, the former Yugoslav Army
chief of staff, Stevan Mirkovic, insisted that the army command
staff was still under Milosevic's control, and that their refusal
to sign the withdrawal document was merely a stalling tactic meant
to allow a Security Council resolution that would transfer from
NATO to the UN responsibility for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be over in three days or less,'' said Mirkovic, 70,
who was harshly critical of both Milosevic and the military, saying
they should have fought to hold on to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Mirkovic said the chief complaint put forward by Serb generals _
that seven days was not long enough to pull out 40,000 troops and
equipment _ is specious. He said the Serb forces could withdraw in
less time.
</P>
<P>
   But he and others said the generals had legitimate concerns
about the threat posed by the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army both to
withdrawing Serb forces and Serb civilians living in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Mirkovic said that, whether in the name of NATO or the UN, the
acceptance of the peace plan that calls for a withdrawal of Serb
troops and their replacement with international peacekeepers ``is
the end of Kosovo'' as part of Serbia. He said that to survive
politically, Milosevic must persuade the public that he had managed
to sidestep NATO and let the UN, to which Yugoslavia belongs, help
the Serbs disarm the KLA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have rather seen a real war. I would have rather lost
the war honorably, as we did in the 14th century, when our leaders
died in war rather than surrender,'' said Mirkovic, referring to
the 1389 battle in Kosovo that the Serbs lost to the Turks in a
defining moment which Serbs see as the birth of their nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no winner here,`` he added. ``NATO has been shamed,
by refusing to fight on the ground. We have been shamed, too, by
giving in to NATO.''
</P>
<P>
   Bratislav Grubacic, a political analyst in Belgrade, said
Milosevic remains firmly in charge. He sees the generals' refusal
to sign the agreement as an attempt to secure political cover for
Milosevic _ a UN resolution on Kosovo that the president can sell
to the public as a victory over NATO.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs an alibi,'' said Grubacic.
</P>
<P>
   It remains unclear, meanwhile, how many of the 10 million people
in Yugoslavia know what is going on. Government-controlled
television, on which the vast majority of people rely for
information, has been reporting that the discussions in Macedonia
have been between Yugoslav generals and UN officials, not NATO.
</P>
<P>
   The official media has also suggested that NATO has tried to
make new demands on the Yugoslav government. Many people here
express worry that the deal will collapse, but others say their
government should not be humiliated.
</P>
<P>
   Zarko Culum, 41, a tram driver, voiced the sentiment of the
latter group, saying, ``We've given up enough. They've squeezed us
like lemons.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieutenant General Mike Jackson, commander of NATO's 16,000
troops in Macedonia, which are set to move into Kosovo, announced
early Monday that the Yugoslav generals were refusing to sign the
withdrawal document.
</P>
<P>
   In response, he said, NATO would intensify its bombing campaign,
which had been scaled down last week in response to Milosevic's
announcement that he accepted the G-8 terms.
</P>
<P>
   Citing a string of broken promises by Milosevic throughout the
decade, NATO has said it will not stop its bombing campaign until
it sees evidence of troops withdrawing from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   NATO underscored its determination to continue its pressure by
using B-52 bombers to pound Serb positions just inside Kosovo near
the Albanian border.
</P>
<P>
   NATO bombs also hit the Ekohrana agricultural complex near
Boljevac about 12 miles southeast of Belgrade in the afternoon,
killing three people, the official news agency Tanjug said.
</P>
<P>
   Zoran Djindjic, the leader of a main opposition party, said that
he believes Milosevic will honor the peace plan he accepted, and
that the reluctance of generals to sign is an attempt to give
Milosevic a ``fig leaf'' that would make the end of the war look
like a victory rather than a defeat.

STOCKS RALLY ON MERGER NEWS AND EASED INTEREST-HIKE WORRIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stock prices rallied Monday, lifted by a brace of
merger announcements and an apparent sense that any move by the
Federal Reserve Board to raise interest rates would be a one-time
event rather than part of a prolonged tightening of policy.
</P>
<P>
   Paced by Allied Signal, which said it was merging with
Honeywell, the Dow Jones industrial average rose for the fifth time
in the last six sessions, closing at its highest level since
mid-May.
</P>
<P>
   Sectors that have been battered recently, including computers,
Internet stocks and financial services, rebounded, helping to push
up broader market averages.
</P>
<P>
   However, trading volume was quite light _ it was the
second-slowest day of the year on the New York Stock Exchange _
leading some analysts and traders to question the significance of
the rise in prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are getting a lot of movement on very thin volume,'' said
William Meehan, chief market analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald. ``From
an investment point of view, there is an extraordinary amount of
risk in the market. But from a short-term perspective, it looks
like people want to trade this thing higher.''
</P>
<P>
   By the close, the Dow was up 109.54 points, or 1 percent, at
10,909.38.
</P>
<P>
   Gains in stocks like Dell Computer; American International
Group, the big insurance company, and DuPont pushed the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500-stock index ahead by 6.77 points, or five-tenths of 1
percent, to 1,334.52. Weakness in drug stocks like Pfizer and Eli
Lilly limited the S&AMP;P's advance.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index soared 45.87 points, or 1.9 percent,
to 2,524.21, propelled by technology stocks. TheStreet.com's
Internet index did even better, rising 32.41 points, or 5.9
percent, to 583.87. And small-cap stocks did well: the Russell 2000

<P>
   Some traders suggested that the increase in prices was a
follow-through from the gains on Friday, after the release of May
employment data showing that the nation's labor market remained
robust.
</P>
<P>
   But the bond market, which more or less shrugged at the jobs
figures, failed to rally Monday; traders appear convinced the Fed
will raise rates at the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts were not so sure. ``I am pretty clearly in the
minority, but I don't expect the Fed to raise rates,'' said Henry
Herrmann, chief investment officer at Waddell &AMP; Reed in Overland
Park, Kan., a firm that manages more than $27 billion in assets,
adding, ``I see too many signs saying there is no inflation.''

</P>
<P>
   Allied Signal, the leading maker of flight systems, rose 4 7/16,
to 62 13/16 after confirming that it would buy Honeywell, the
world's largest maker of automated controls, for $14.8 billion in
stock, plus the assumption of debt. Honeywell jumped 7, to 112.

<P>
   Columbia Energy Group jumped 7 7/16, to 63 3/16, after

DRUG REGIMEN CREDITED WITH BEATING AGGRESSIVE TUMOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It started with an earache. But in a scenario every
parent fears, 5-year-old Jennifer LaChance's problem eventually
proved to be a large, aggressive tumor in her jaw.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer's tumor technically was not cancer, yet it was so
aggressive and resistant to standard treatment that it was almost
as menacing.
</P>
<P>
   Laced with a dense web of blood vessels that fed its growth, the
tumor kept coming back within months after surgeons twice removed
it. At its biggest, the tumor kept her from closing her mouth, and
her teeth were pushed out of place. Surgeons resorted to removing
half her lower jaw in hopes of getting it all, but still the tumor
grew back.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a tough time for us,'' said her mother of the period
in 1994. ``We were thinking, now what?''
</P>
<P>
   Radiation was one fallback treatment, but doctors feared it
would stunt growth in one side of Jennifer's face while the other
side grew normally.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with this dilemma, their oral surgeon, Dr. Leonard Kaban
of Massachusetts General Hospital, consulted Dr. Judah Folkman,
head of the surgical research lab at Children's Hospital in Boston.
Folkman had pioneered the use of drugs that can treat tumors rich
in blood vessels, called hemangiomas, in children by cutting off
the ``private blood supply'' the tumors recruit from nearby
tissues.
</P>
<P>
   In a paper being published Tuesday in the journal Pediatrics,
Folkman, Kaban, and colleagues describe how the tumor was finally
beaten with a yearlong regimen of a drug, interferon alfa-2a, that
knocked out the tumor's ability to recruit new blood vessels.
</P>
<P>
   Folkman has discussed the case to rapt audiences at medical
meetings, but had not previously identified Jennifer.
</P>
<P>
   What broke the treatment impasse was Folkman's suggestion that
Jennifer's blood be tested for the presence of a protein called
basic fibroblast growth factor (basic FGF). He suspected that
Jennifer's tumor might be secreting FGF, a so-called angiogenic
factor that the tumor puts out as a signal for nearby tissues to
sprout new vessels to feed it.
</P>
<P>
   And, Folkman knew, recent research had shown that interferon
alpha, made by the body's immune system, could shut down
overproduction of FGF.
</P>
<P>
   The test showed that Folkman was right. Her blood contained many
times the normal amount of FGF. ``That was exciting, because now we
had a treatment that could potentially help her'' without having
the drastic side effects of radiation therapy, Kaban said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Folkman reasoned, ``You could give interferon alpha at a low
dose every day'' without causing the side effects it can trigger in
large doses. ``We started giving her small injections at night, and
by four weeks'' the tumor was gone, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer had few side effects, except early in the treatment
when she had hallucinations ``and saw gummy bears running around
the house,'' said her mother.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors were gratified to see that as the interferon
treatment progressed and the tumor shrank, Jennifer's blood levels
of FGF fell. That was strong evidence that the interferon was
shrinking the tumor by shutting off its FGF signals in search of
new blood vessels.
</P>
<P>
   Twice during the year of treatment the doses had to be raised
because the tumor was coming back, but both times it worked.
Tuesday, Jennifer is 9. The tumor, called a giant-cell tumor,
appears to be gone for good, and her missing jawbone has regrown,
somewhat to the doctors' surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at her, says her father, Michael, ``If you didn't know
it, you wouldn't think anything was wrong.'' The LaChances live in
Lincoln, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   It is believed to be the first time that a giant-cell tumor of
the jaw has been cured with a drug that inhibits angiogenesis _ the
growth of blood vessels that allow a tumor to enlarge and spread.
Since then, the treatment has been used successfully in about six
other cases, says Folkman.
</P>
<P>
   The half of Jennifer's jaw that had been removed grew back
during her year of therapy: whether the interferon was responsible
isn't clear, said Kaban. She is still missing all her lower teeth
on that side, but Kaban said it isn't a major problem and that she
can have implants put in when she's older.
</P>
<P>
   Angiogenesis inhibitors, pioneered by Folkman and his colleagues
at Children's Hospital, are in the spotlight because they show
enormous promise for treating cancer by starving it of its blood
supply.
</P>
<P>
   Interferon is one of the weaker angiogenesis inhibitors, Folkman
says. Yet it worked well in Jennifer's case by being given over a
long period. That's how Folkman believes newer and stronger
angiogenesis inhibitors, like the promising drugs endostatin and
angiostatin that have not yet been tested in people, may be able to
control cancer.

   SKOPJE, Macedonia _ The military talks intended to seal the
withdrawal of Serbian forces from Kosovo stalled in part because
the Yugoslav military balked at provisions that would have avoided
any further U.N. action on the peacekeeping force, according to
NATO officials and Western diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Western diplomat familiar with the NATO document said
Western political leaders had tried to slip that provision into
what was supposed to be a highly detailed technical agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there was this idea that if you call it a technical
document it would hide the fact that it went beyond the nuts and
bolts of the military arrangement and was essentially creating the
legal basis for the Kosovo peacekeeping force,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   A NATO source said NATO's military officials themselves had been
unaware of these implications. According to the source, alliance
commanders had been assured that all of the political questions
were resolved last week during negotiations between President
Slobodan Milosevic, Finland President Martti Ahtisaari and Russian
special envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
   In the third point of that political agreement, a direct
reference was made to the United Nations for the deployment of
peacekeeping troops to Kosovo, but officials here said the six-page
agreement under negotiation never mentioned the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew the problem of the U.N. would be exposed during the
talks,'' said a senior European diplomat here. ``Why, then, was the
military encouraged to pursue the talks without the U.N.?''
</P>
<P>
   Another Western diplomat, speaking in Washington, said that the
Yugoslav military had been fully aware of the scope of the document
under negotiation here and their objections about the omission of
the United Nations were an excuse to stop talking.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I think is going on here is that the Yugoslavs want to
have another go at negotiating this, but with the Russians and
Chinese helping them out,'' the diplomat said. ``They want this
done in another venue, and take another crack at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, NATO military officials said Monday that the two days
of talks with the Yugoslav military officers did resolve the basic
aspects of the Serb withdrawal and NATO entry into Kosovo, and
refused to characterize the breakdown as a setback.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all worked on the level of military men speaking to
military men,'' said Lt. Col. Robin Clifford, spokesman for NATO
forces in Macedonia. ``What this exactly achieved is that firstly
we met and started this discussion process. We know now where each
other is coming from.''
</P>
<P>
   The talks stalled on Sunday after a second day in which both
sides reviewed the document covering the proposed terms of the
withdrawal of Serb troops and their replacement by a NATO-led
force. After 17 hours, the Yugoslav delegation refused to sign
without some form of U.N. mandate.
</P>
<P>
   Several military officials and diplomats suggested Monday that
the problem was predictable. They said anyone who had ever
negotiated with Milosevic would never have expected him to sign off
on a document presented on a take-it-or-leave-it basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got to have some fig leaf to explain to his people why
they had to endure 2{ months of bombing that has ruined their
country for an agreement that looks an awful lot like the one that
was rejected before the bombing started,'' said a senior Western
official.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On Monday afternoon, British Minister of Defense George
Robertson made a hastily arranged visit here for talks with Lt.
Gen. Michael Jackson, the commander of KFOR, NATO's peacekeeping
force for Kosovo, and a much-decorated British officer.
</P>
<P>
   Those talks between the general and Robertson were expected to
center on the strategy for convincing Milosevic to accept terms for
withdrawal from Kosovo soon.
</P>
<P>
   However the politicians resolve the U.N. issue, NATO will be in
command of the peacekeeping forces, which will be made up of 50,000
troops. Nearly 16,000 troops have been deployed here over the past
two months and are prepared to enter Kosovo as soon as an agreement
is reached.
</P>
<P>
   However, NATO officials said here Monday that they did not
believe they had lost the momentum for a peace settlement. In spite
of the collapse of the military talks Sunday, NATO and Yugoslav
military officials had a short ``exchange of information'' meeting
Monday at the French air base where Sunday's talks were held.
Clifford said the meeting was an attempt to make the best use of
this new contact between the two warring sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having established the contact, the one thing we are very keen
to do is to keep these lines of communication open,'' he said.

NEW REPORT CITES THREATS TO MARINE LIFE FROM GLOBAL WARMING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On the west coast of Canada's Hudson Bay, fewer and
fewer polar bears are being born each year.
</P>
<P>
   In the Maldive Islands, coral are bleaching and then dying.
</P>
<P>
   And in the North Pacific, sockeye salmon seem to be losing
weight.
</P>
<P>
   These are a few of the signs that scientists say point to an
increasingly inescapable conclusion: global warming is threatening
marine life worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   In a report scheduled for release Tuesday, the Redmond,
Wash-based Marine Conservation Biology Institute and the World
Wildlife Fund declare that ``global climate change is an additional
stress on already stressed species, and may be the straw that
breaks the camel's back for many types of marine life.''
</P>
<P>
   The scientists did not do new research, but pulled together a
variety of academic studies conducted in recent years in an effort
to show a broad picture of the effects of global warming.
</P>
<P>
   ``The news is not good,'' said Elliott Norse, the biologist who
heads the Marine Conservation Biology Institute. ``The thing that
screams out here is that from the inter-tidal zone to the open
ocean, from the Antarctic to the Arctic, we are seeing worrisome
things everywhere that seem to be most closely correlated with
climate change.''
</P>
<P>
   Norse offered a variety of recent examples of the impacts of
global warming, from the encroachment of subalpine firs into the
alpine meadows on Mount Rainier, to the marlin caught off Longview,
Wash., to the appearance of Pacific dolphins off the Aleutian
islands.
</P>
<P>
   Even the recent spate of emaciated gray whales beaching
themselves along the West Coast may be attributable to global
warming, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In virtually every example, Norse said, species such as fish or
bears or whales appear to be suffering from a lack of food that is
connected to a warming of the ocean. Polar bears, for example, seem
to be suffering from a decline in the amount of sea ice, which is a
source of algae that form the lowest rung on the bears' food chain.
'
</P>
<P>
   The report says the Alaskan salmon population declined
drastically in 1997 and 1998, and that salmon that survive are
unusually small, suggesting that they were starved. The report says
that sockeye are particularly susceptible to temperature
variations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Researchers predict that anticipated increases in water
temperature caused by a double of carbon dioxide will eliminate
most, if not all, suitable habitat for Pacific sockeye salmon, and
possibly for other salmon species as well,'' the report says.
</P>
<P>
   The report was greeted skeptically by critics of global warming
science.
</P>
<P>
   ``This doesn't surprise me, because they blame everything on
global warming from tornadoes to droughts to heat waves,'' said
John Carlisle, director of the environmental policy task force for
The National Center for Public Policy Research, a conservative
think tank. ``But there is no firm evidence that man-made global
warming is even occurring. The fact is that the Earth's temperature
is naturally fluctuating.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Maisano, a spokesman for an alliance of businesses called
the Global Climate Coalition, said environmentalists are too quick
to use unproven theories and circumstantial evidence to bolster
claims of damage from global warning.
</P>
<P>
   But Norse said the evidence that global warming is harming
marine life is overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether the warming we have been seeing is caused by people is
unclear, but that is by far the most logical explanation for the
fact that the weather is the warmest it's been for thousands of
years,'' Norse said. ``The evidence is so strong, it's almost like
the evidence for gravity. The people who deny it are denying it for
reasons that are not scientific or substantive, but because it goes
against their beliefs or economic interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Global warming is the change in the climate thought to occur
because human activities add to a buildup of greenhouse gases such
as carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide. Those gases trap
heat, and although there is ongoing dispute about how that in turn
affects the climate, there is no doubt that global temperatures are
rising.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Environmental Protection Agency, over the past
century mean global temperatures have increased 0.6 to 1.2 degrees,
the global sea level has risen 4 to 10 inches, and the snow cover
in the Northern Hemisphere and floating ice in the Arctic Ocean
have decreased. The 10 warmest years of this century have occurred
within the past 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   What to do about global warming is controversial, both in
Congress and in the international policy arena. World diplomats
meeting in Bonn have been bogged down in a dispute between the
United States and Europe over how to address global warming. And
the Clinton administration has yet to ask Congress to approve the
Kyoto Protocol it signed in 1997, saying that it is waiting for
more developing countries to sign onto the pact to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions.
</P>
<P>
   The report also comes at a time when residents of the Northwest
and the country are already spending millions of dollars and facing
potential restrictions in development in order to address other
factors thought to be harming Pacific salmon, such as overfishing,
dams and hatcheries.

<P>
   KUKES, Albania _ When he heard the news of a peace deal between
NATO and the Yugoslav government last week, a deal that might send
him back home after two months as a refugee, Ismet Memaj reacted by
celebrating.
</P>
<P>
   ``I drank all day,'' said Memaj, a 52-year-old construction
worker. ``It's true. I was so happy.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, after hearing that the deal might be in danger, he
was more sober-minded. He took his 4-month-old daughter, Daniela,
to a photo shop here to have her passport pictures made. If the
peace deal goes forward, he will go back to Kosovo and wants to be
ready because the family's old identification cards were stolen by
the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   If there is no deal, he will use them to apply to go far away
from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   He simply has no idea which way the talks will tip, and for him
and the hundreds of thousands of other Kosovo Albanians who have
been forced from their homes, this most recent chapter in the
Kosovo crisis has only added more maddening uncertainty to the
uncertain life of a refugee.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the moment, we have lost our hope,'' he said. ``It all
depends on NATO.''
</P>
<P>
   Though it stopped neither the NATO bombing nor the war between
Serbian forces and the rebel group fighting them, the tentative
peace agreement had completely changed the focus in the camps here.
</P>
<P>
   The question of what to do when winter arrived gave way to plans
for an orderly return. The drive to move refugees away from camps
near the border _ away from the fighting and the overstrained town
of Kukes _ had been picking up steam. But Monday the NATO buses to
camps in southern Albania were canceled because so few people
signed up.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as NATO, the Serbs and Russians all dicker over the details
of the peace accord, people here say they have no idea what will
happen next.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in a kind of a trauma,'' said Ymredin Krasniqi, a
47-year-old elementary school teacher living in a small room next
to an electric motor repair shop with 17 other family members.
``They are talking about a peace agreement, but the peace agreement
is nowhere. Where is this peace agreement?''
</P>
<P>
   Military officials from Yugoslavia and NATO were supposed to
sign an agreement in Macedonia on Saturday finalizing technical
details of the pact made last Thursday between NATO and President
Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia. But the talks broke down, with
Yugoslavia raising questions about the agreement's fine print.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, NATO officials announced that they would escalate the
bombing if the deal was not made final. While it seemed to show
some restraint on Monday, NATO continued its attacks on Serbian
positions near the Albanian border, where the fighting has been
heavy between Yugoslav troops and the rebel forces of the Kosovo
Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   Starting at 3:30 p.m. and lasting almost an hour, NATO planes
bombarded several targets near Mount Pastrik, overlooking the main
border crossing here.
</P>
<P>
   Possibly giving credence to speculation that the rebels and NATO
are working together closely _ though NATO has said it has been
taking advantage of the concentrations of Yugoslav troops amassed
to attack the rebels _ the targets Monday were several miles deeper
into Kosovo than similar strikes on Sunday. And Monday the rebels
announced that they had in fact advanced a mile on Sunday after
those bombings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's coincidence,'' said one rebel official, Masar Shala, when
asked to what extent NATO and the rebels were coordinating their
attacks. Shala also contended that more than 200 Serbian soldiers
were killed in the attacks by NATO and the rebels on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   At the border on Monday, another 100 refugees crossed over into
Albania. They said they came from a prison in northern Kosovo where
other refugees have reported that Serbian forces have taken
thousands of men for interrogation before expelling them from the
province.
</P>
<P>
   One of the men who crossed Monday, Batir Kurti, 47 _ who said he
was held for a week _ said the jail, which holds 3,000 or more
people, is still completely full.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't know about any peace agreement,'' he said just after
crossing the border in a line of tired men sweating from their
walk.
</P>
<P>
   Around the town of Kukes, roughly 70,000 refugees have found
housing in addition to those in the camps, several people said that
even though they were happy when the agreement was announced last
week, they did not ever really trust Milosevic to honor his pledge.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't believe him,'' said Selmon Limoni, a 75-year-old
refugee, as he sat on a stone near downtown Kukes as the sound of
evening prayers lifted from a mosque at sunset. Like several other
refugees, he said that NATO should send ground troops into Kosovo,
even without an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you wait for Milosevic to sign, the troops will never get
in _ never,'' he said. ``I thought the United States, Germany and
all these powerful countries were not scared of Milosevic. To be
afraid of him, it's shameful.''
</P>
<P>
   Bahrie Shala, 19, said she has been suspending any excitement
about the deal. ``I won't believe it until I get to my home,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   But others had more faith. The refugees had left at a moment's
notice and were ready to return as quickly, but there were still
errands to run. Two days ago, Zijadin Shala, 27, took his wife and
child to the Kukes city hall for a document proving he was a
refugee to whoever might ask on the trek home.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the document is useless, he said on Monday evening
after dinner as his wife yet again scraped the family dishes into a
common trash heap for dozens of families who live with their
tractors near downtown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are just waiting for what the world will say to us,'' he
said.

CONGRESSMEN RETURN TO INTENSIFIED BATTLE OVER GUN CONTROL 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: The 2nd take is scheduled to move by 9 p.m. ET.) 
(mk) 
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Members of the House of Representatives returned
from a weeklong recess Monday to confront a looming battle over gun
control that is even more fraught with political anxiety than it
was before they left.
</P>
<P>
   Increased tensions over new gun-control measures partly
reflected the febrile activity of the National Rifle Association,
which used the congressional recess to rally its supporters, lobby
lawmakers and sprinkle the radio airwaves with advertisements in
opposition to some of the gun-control measures under consideration
in the House.
</P>
<P>
   The NRA is pursuing a much more aggressive campaign in the House
than it was able to organize in the Senate, where the gun-control
debate flared with little advance notice. In the Senate, measures
restricting sales of firearms at gun shows and a ban on the import
of high-capacity ammunition clips passed over the rifle group's
objections. The NRA will attempt to beat back similar gun-control
measures that will likely be folded into a juvenile crime bill that
is expected to come to the House floor later this week or early
next week.
</P>
<P>
   The NRA also appears to have taken aim at a rival lobbying
organization of gun manufacturers that supported some of the
measures passed by the Senate last month.
</P>
<P>
   By just about every lawmaker's estimation, the House is certain
to follow the Senate's lead and pass several new gun-control
measures, possibly within the next two weeks. Speaker J. Dennis
Hastert has promised a floor debate within that time frame and
personally signaled his support for a number of new restrictions on
firearms.
</P>
<P>
   The rifle association is most fervently opposed to any provision
requiring mandatory background checks on buyers at gun shows that
contains language and details identical to the contents of a
measure passed by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Senate measure, vendors at gun shows would have three
business days to complete those checks. The rifle association,
complaining that most weekend gun shows do not last that long,
wants to put a 24-hour limit on the time given to vendors. They
will fight for a shorter background check in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Although most background checks take just minutes, a small
percentage of them can take several days.
</P>
<P>
   The rifle association and many Republicans also contend that the
Senate measure contains a thicket of unnecessarily bureaucratic
paperwork for vendors and gun-show operators.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter that the group sent to its supporters last week, it
warned that what these regulations would do is ``impose a
cradle-to-grave massive federal regulatory scheme on gun owners
throughout America _ and that's no exaggeration!''
</P>
<P>
   The House battle will provide a more definitive measure of the
rifle association's political muscle in the aftermath of a series
of bloody school shootings that created a new momentum for
additional restrictions on firearms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're touching base with just about everybody up there, except
for the people who have absolutely, positively staked out their
position,'' James Jay Baker, the group's chief lobbyist, said
Monday. In addition, Baker said, ``We put together a lot of
grass-roots efforts that came together over the break.''
</P>
<P>
   The recess also provided an opportunity for House Republicans to
reassess their strategy. They said Monday that they might cancel a
scheduled meeting of the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday at
which committee members were expected to debate, and vote on, the
precise gun-control measures to be folded into the juvenile crime
bill.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, according to senior aides, Republican leaders would
bypass the committee, bring the crime bill to the floor without gun
control provisions and allow those measures to be introduced on the
floor as amendments.

COMING DAYS CALLED CRITICAL TO FUTURE OF MEDICARE REFORM
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By CARL HULSE   
 NYT Regional Newspapers   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Nearly everyone in Washington has an opinion on how
to fix Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats want to add drug coverage to the program to give
financial relief to beneficiaries relying on a growing array of
costly prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans generally favor running the program more like those
now available in the working world, providing retirees with a
subsidy toward coverage to be chosen from competing insurance
plans.
</P>
<P>
   The medical community wants higher reimbursements, complaining
that reductions in spending arising from the 1997 balanced budget
law are squeezing many hospitals, nursing homes, home-health
agencies and managed care plans.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the desire is strong for reforms in the $215 billion
program that insures 38 million older and disabled Americans. The
problem is, one side's solution is viewed as another's step
backward.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are leery of the Republican approach, saying it would
weaken the guarantee of insurance seniors now enjoy. Republicans
are nervous about adding a new drug benefit without making other
structural alterations. Health- care providers worry any changes
could carry costs that cut deeper into their payments.
</P>
<P>
   These profound conflicts go to the heart of Medicare reform, a
politically volatile subject now nearing a pivotal moment.
President Clinton is due to unveil his approach to overhauling
Medicare this month and a separate bipartisan proposal will soon be
introduced in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next few weeks are critical,'' declared Sen. John Breaux,
the Louisiana Democrat who led a blue-ribbon panel that failed to
agree on a new Medicare model earlier this year. Now he and Rep.
Bill Thomas, R-Calif., plan to push a congressional version of the
commission plan to give seniors a subsidy toward insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Breaux still believes sweeping Medicare change could be enacted
this year in light of the president's commitment to advancing a
plan and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott's own call last month
for movement on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It needs to be done,'' Lott, R-Miss., told the Finance
Committee on May 26. ``Medicare is over 30 years old. Not many of
us drive a 30-year-old car. It is time we look at Medicare and
upgrade this car, get a little better model.''
</P>
<P>
   But analysts and other lawmakers are skeptical that substantial
progress can be made. In the House, Democratic leaders are
reluctant to agree on a plan and sacrifice a winning issue for them
in the fight for House control. And the savings wrung out of the
program have now extended its financial life until 2015, sapping
the urgency from the push for action.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we are going to do anything big this year,''
predicted a top lobbyist for the American Association of Retired
Persons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would be a very tight squeeze to get anything
done,'' agreed Rep. Karen Thurman, D-Fla., who sits on a House
subcommittee with jurisdiction over Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   The more likely outcome is that Congress will attempt to fix
some of the most pressing Medicare concerns and leave the heavy
lifting until after the 2000 elections.
</P>
<P>
   Thurman would like to see Congress enact a proposal that forces
drug companies to offer prescriptions to beneficiaries at the same
prices they charge bulk users such as health-maintenance
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Citing a new report showing that seniors pay vastly higher
amounts for the drugs, she said the measure could provide some
financial breathing room for beneficiaries in the absence of an
overall Medicare drug benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Others in Congress are seeking a solution to the crisis caused
in some communities by the sudden withdrawal of Medicare HMOs,
leaving thousands of beneficiaries without a managed care option.
Eight Republican House members recently sent a letter demanding
action on the HMO issue to House GOP leaders on health-care policy.
</P>
<P>
   Health-care providers seem to be making progress in their push
to raise reimbursement rates as Gail Wilensky, a former Medicare
agency chief who now heads a Medicare advisory commission, came out
in support of some increases.
</P>
<P>
   But the prospect of another round of incremental Medicare
changes is distressing to Breaux and others who believe Medicare's
shortcomings must be addressed comprehensively.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problems you face today _ how to keep Medicare both
solvent and within reach of the modern world _ you will face
forever unless you can fundamentally change the structure of the
program,'' Harry P. Cain, executive director of the Blue Cross and
Blue Shield Association, told the finance committee.
</P>
<P>
   Breaux agreed. ``You can't piecemeal this thing,'' he said. ``A
total package of reforms is needed.''
</P>

 &HT;    Portraits a new vista for Wolf Camera
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Wolf Camera will soon delve into the portrait business
with four studios in metro Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The fast-growing retailer, which spent most of last year
doubling its size through a string of acquisitions, is testing the
new service on its home turf before rolling it out nationwide. Now
one of the nation's largest specialty retailers of photo equipment
and film processing, Wolf Camera is looking at the studio realm as
another way to expand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got the idea from one of the companies we acquired last
year,'' said Wayne Freedman, senior vice president of marketing for
Alpharetta-based Wolf Camera. Last summer, Wolf Camera made the
biggest acquisition of its 25-year history when it bought the
450-store Fox Photo chain from Eastman Kodak Co. Part of the deal
involved 35 Proex Photo stores in Minneapolis equipped with
portrait studios.
</P>
<P>
   According to Freedman, the studio business was too lucrative not
to keep. ``They've got a 30 percent share of the portrait market
there, even with all the competition from mass merchants and other
studios. We learned from them how to do it, and now they're
teaching us how to roll it out here,'' Freedman said.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf Camera is entering a crowded arena. Metro Atlanta has
dozens of independent portrait studios, and it's home to several
studio outfits in large retailers like Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co. and
Kmart. Wolf thinks it can lure business away from others by
positioning itself as an expert with a good price.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think there's a lot of dissatisfaction with the portrait
experience among parents with young children. Photographers are not
as patient with kids as they should be,'' Freedman said. Wolf
Camera has hired three to four photographers for each store that
will be trained in social interaction, he said. The Wolf studios,
being built next to existing stores, will also have plenty of toys
and videos to keep children from getting restless, he added.
</P>
<P>
   The other part of Wolf's portrait strategy is to loosen the
restrictions on traditional portrait packages.
</P>
<P>
   Founder Chuck Wolf, widely known as the company's spokesman in
television commercials, will market the concept as ``a portrait
studio where you call the shots.'' Essentially, customers will be
able to pick the proofs in sizes and quantities they want for a set
price. In some instances, they'll get to keep the negatives. That
will enable customers to reprint and copy the photos as much as
they like.
</P>
<P>
   Promotions will start in a few weeks, and the four studios are
set to open in July, Freedman said.
</P>
<P>
   If the test studios are successful, Wolf Camera plans to roll it
out nationwide next year. The retailer now operates more than 700
stores in 30 states, including 73 stores in metro Atlanta.

ON TENNIS: AGASSI AND GRAF REVIVE THEIR CAREERS IN PARIS 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ In the end, it was all about leaving Paris with no
regrets.
</P>
<P>
   When the red dust settled at a tumultuous French Open that
breathed new life into several stunted careers and served as a
turning point for several others, a pair of 29-year-old champions
dusted off their reputations, removed the ``former'' from their
resumes and reasserted themselves as forces to be reckoned with at
this and every Grand Slam event.
</P>
<P>
   Andre Agassi, after riffing through his career like a jazz
musician, all improvisation and unpredictability, made history as
he exorcised the Roland Garros demons that have haunted him since
he faltered in the 1990 and 1991 finals.
</P>
<P>
   With his galvanizing 1-6, 2-6, 6-4, 6-3, 6-4 comeback in the
final against Andrei Medvedev on Sunday, Agassi became the fifth
man to have won all four Grand Slam titles in a career. He joined
Rod Laver, Don Budge, Fred Perry and Roy Emerson.
</P>
<P>
   The men who completed a true Grand Slam, all four titles in one
calendar year, were Budge in 1938 and Laver in 1962 and 1969.
</P>
<P>
   After a decade of mercurial results, suddenly the Las Vegan was
defining tradition, not defying it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He put a lot of ghosts to rest; this really cements
something,'' Brad Gilbert, Agassi's coach of five years, said. ``A
lot of people say Andre can't win from two-sets-to-none down, can't
win a five-set match, can never win on clay. But Andre's got the
most God-given talent I've ever seen. Sometimes you expect the most
from him and he gives you the least. Sometimes he can reach back
and grab some magic like nobody.''
</P>
<P>
   What Agassi grabbed on Sunday was his fourth career Grand Slam
title _ the 1992 Wimbledon, the 1994 United States Open while
unseeded and the 1995 Australian Open are the others _ plus
confirmation that his current fitness and focus campaign has been
worth his while.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a big obstacle for me psychologically and
emotionally,'' Agassi said. ``This being the last of the Slams, me
being ranked 140 a couple years ago, believing that if I just try
hard enough some good things are waiting for me.''
</P>
<P>
   The French Open's new women's champion, Steffi Graf, returned to
the Grand Slam winner's circle for the first time since the 1996
United States Open.
</P>
<P>
   In a wildly unconventional final against top-ranked Martina
Hingis on Saturday, Graf ignored her aching back and her opponents
astonishingly unsportsmanlike tantrums and secured her sixth French
Open championship with a 4-6, 7-5, 6-2 comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Graf became the first women to defeat the top-three seeded
players at the same event as she won her 22nd Grand Slam title,
leaving her only two short of the record held by Margaret Court
(24).
</P>
<P>
   Graf, apparently flirting with the notion of retirement after
this season, announced that she would not return to Roland Garros
next year to defend her title, dropping a bombshell that left even
her longtime coach, Heinz Gunthardt, in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told her a week before the tournament began that she had
nothing to prove to anyone, didn't need to listen to anyone telling
her where or what she should play,'' said Gunthardt, who called his
player's Paris revival ``fairy tale stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   But the German star, who turns 30 next week, made it clear she
would tackle Wimbledon, her favorite Grand Slam and the one that
has earned her seven titles, with all the conviction that was
lacking at the start of her French Open crusade.
</P>
<P>
   ``It came out of nowhere, this one,'' Graf said. ``But it's made
me believe in me, and sometimes I've had problems doing that over
the last few years.''
</P>
<P>
   One player who does not lack for self-esteem is the 18-year-old
Hingis, who was so certain she was going to defeat Graf that she
had already selected a party dress to wear when she posed with her
trophy. But Hingis, who was foiled at the end of the second set as
she served for her first French Open title, became unhinged midway
through the match when she questioned a line call and never
regained her equilibrium.
</P>
<P>
   Her decision to stalk over to Graf's side of the court to
inspect a mark at 6-4, 2-0 of the second set not only cost her a
point penalty and then the enmity of 16,000 booing and hissing
Roland Garros fans, it later cost her a $1,500 fine.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis, who dissolved in angry tears after the defeat, her
seventh in nine matches with Graf, left the French Open with ample
regrets. Graf and Agassi left with none, and revalidated themselves

   ``It was almost like it was destiny, this tournament for her and
in some cases for me, too,'' Agassi said. ``When I won my first
Grand Slam, she was the winner, too. But she's won 22 Slams, and

TEXAS COUNTY STUDIES HOW NEW LAW WILL AFFECT JUDICIAL SYSTEM 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ALAN BERNSTEIN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The new state law restricting abortions for girls has created a
set of legal mysteries in Harris County, where more than 100 minors
a year may go to court to avoid telling their parents about a
pregnancy they want to end.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush signed the legislation into law Monday at a
ceremony at a Dallas hotel. He said the new law ``makes a simple,
urgent point: when a child is in crisis, parents should have a role
and a voice. They should be the first to help, not the last to
know.''
</P>
<P>
   When the law goes into effect Jan. 1, 2000, doctors will have to
notify a parent or guardian 48 hours before performing an abortion
on a patient 17 years old or younger.
</P>
<P>
   There can be exceptions, however. A girl can convince a judge
not to notify her parent or guardian on grounds that it ``would not
be in the minor's best interest,'' that she is mature and
well-informed, or that notification will lead to physical, sexual
or emotional abuse of the pregnant patient.
</P>
<P>
   The law qualifies more than 80 judges in Harris County, which
includes most of Houston, to grant a parental notification
``bypass.'' It says a girl's request can go to a state district
judge, appeals judge, probate judge or county court-at-law judge.
</P>
<P>
   But at a private meeting Tuesday, the judges plan to discuss the
idea of funneling every ``bypass'' request in the county to its
three juvenile court judges: Republicans Mary Craft, Kent Ellis and
Pat Shelton.
</P>
<P>
   The new law makes no mention of designating courts to take
``bypass'' requests. But the county's judicial administrator, state
district Judge Elizabeth Ray, said the local board of judges has
the power to sluice the cases to specific courts.
</P>
<P>
   Ray said the juvenile courts and the county's nine family courts
are the most appropriate. But unlike family courts, she said,
juvenile courts have staff investigators who could help the judges
meet the 48-hour deadline.
</P>
<P>
   If the judge does not rule in two business days, the ``bypass''
request is automatically granted, according to the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to tell at this point how many judicial and staff
hours it is going to take to manage these cases, because we don't
know how many there are,'' Ray said.
</P>
<P>
   The three juvenile court judges did not return telephone calls
seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   District Clerk Charles Bacarisse said the abortion hearings are
a new kind of case requiring a novel set of court rules, especially
if they can be brought to any qualified judge in the county.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be a challenge for us,'' he said. ``I feel we
can get a good system worked out. It's going to be a process of
getting the right people in the right room, which we have not done
yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Planned Parenthood of Houston and Southeast Texas Inc., whose
services include abortions, estimates from a survey of its underage
patients that more than 100 girls a year will seek court permission
to have an abortion without their parent or guardian being
notified.
</P>
<P>
   The estimate is based on a survey of 131 girls who obtained
abortions during a three-month span last summer. Of those, 25 said
they did not involve a parent or a trusted adult in their decision
to terminate their pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   Planned Parenthood is forming a task force of lawyers, clergy
and community leaders to study the law and will consider helping
girls make ``bypass'' requests, spokeswoman Susan Nenney said.
</P>
<P>
   If a girl files a request without a lawyer, the judge must
appoint one for her at state expense.
</P>
<P>
   The new law is silent about whether girls must apply for a
bypass only in their home county.
</P>
<P>
   That means an application by a Harris County girl could be filed
anywhere in the state, according to Joe Kral, legislative director
of Houston-based Texas Right To Life Committee Inc., which opposes
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   The committee will monitor statewide rules that will be
developed by Dec. 15 by the state Department of Health and the
Texas Supreme Court, Kral said.
</P>
<P>
   The law requires the health department to publish rules on the
medical rights of abortion patients, information about alternatives
to abortion and the forms doctors must use to inform parents or
guardians. The high court must develop rules for making the court
hearings speedy as well as confidential.
</P>
<P>
   But like many other facets of the laws, those details don't
exist yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got the legislation signed,'' Kral said. ``We need to make
sure the Supreme Court creates rules that don't cause a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The sponsors of the new law, who joined Bush at the signing
ceremony, vowed that it was ``the building block on which future
legislation will stand,'' a promise to continue trying to expand
restriction on abortions that did not surprise abortion-rights
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush is anti-choice,'' said Kae McLaughlin, executive director
of the Texas Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League, who
distributed press releases outside the ballroom where the signing
took place. ``He is trying to appear moderate, but this (bill) is
exactly what the Christian Coalition wanted.``
</P>
<P>
   The Christian Coalition agreed. ``This is a historic day for
Texas,'' said Chuck Anderson, the coalition's executive director in
Texas. ``With more than 80 per cent of the public supporting this
legislation and clear majorities supporting other abortion
restrictions, we are moving in the right direction.``
</P>
<P>
   The National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League, the
countrywide arm of McLaughlin's group, is running ads against Bush
in Iowa, where he makes his first presidential campaign visit
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   When a parental notification bill was considered by the
Legislature in 1997, representatives of Harris County's 59 state
district judges wrote to lawmakers about ``procedural and
administrative problems'' with the proposal. The judges said they
were especially concerned that a ``bypass'' request would force any
judge to close his court to other business for 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
   The judges withdrew their statements after Dr. Steven Hotze, a
Houston conservative activist whose endorsements have swayed
several judicial elections, warned that the judges were undermining
efforts to pass the bill.
</P>
<P>
   The judges did not comment about the bill as a group this year,
Ray said.
</P>
<P>
   The new law in Texas, which is similar to those in 39 other
states, was modeled after Minnesota's, which was upheld by the U.S.
Supreme Court last year. Attorney General John Cornyn said Monday
that the Texas act ``is constitutional and will be successfully
defended in a court.``
</P>
<P>
   Kral said the 48-hour hearings will not stymie Harris County
courts because they already handle cases that need immediate
rulings.
</P>
<P>
   But Ray said case backlogs in other courts was one of the
reasons the cases might be funneled only to the juvenile courts.
</P>
<P>
   Hotze, whose political agenda features opposition to abortion,
backed Pat Shelton, one of the three juvenile court judges, against
a challenger in the 1998 Republican primary. Hotze opposed the
re-election of another juvenile court judge, Mary Craft, but she
prevailed. Juvenile Court Judge Kent Ellis, was unopposed in the
primary.

LOOKING AT THE `BEST' OF THE PAST TV SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the interests of full disclosure, the headline accompanying
this column is like an NBC promotional campaign, that is, not to be
taken literally. Its use of the term ``best'' might suggest we'll
be accentuating only the positive, but we're being coy. Sort of
like the three sisters in ``Charmed,'' who smile sweetly just
before they mess with the space-time continuum.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, some of these acknowledgments of the past TV season aren't
necessarily singing the praises of a particular program or network.
There's plenty of good stuff on television, but there's lot to
complain about, too, even when we're on our ``best'' behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Best new series
</P>
<P>
   to be canceled:
</P>
<P>
   ABC executives gave up on ``Cupid'' faster than some kids give
up on green veggies. Too bad. Like lima beans, it was an acquired
taste, but it was rich in fiber, with Jeremy Piven perfect in a
scenery-chewing role that was an actor's dream.
</P>
<P>
   One consolation: Paula Marshall, who played psychiatrist Claire
Allen opposite Piven's manic Cupid, will be back next season in
David E. Kelley's new ABC drama, ``Snoops.'' A second consolation:
``Cupid'' creator Rob Thomas, a man with interesting ideas, is
executive producer of ``Snoops.''
</P>
<P>
   Best new series to be
</P>
<P>
   renewed, network division:
</P>
<P>
   We'll give this one to ``Sports Night,'' but with several
strings attached so we can yank it back if Felicity Huffman's
character, Dana Whitaker, persists next season in trying to join
the Ally McBeal League of Mixed Nuts. What started out as a
different sort of half-hour program on ABC became distressingly
like most other sitcoms by the end of 22 episodes, with Huffman's
Whitaker going from a strong, multifaceted woman to a quivering,
shivering puddle of Jell-O.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it's inevitable that TV series do the
romance-in-the-workplace dance. But if Robert Guillaume hadn't been
forced into a long absence by a stroke, I'm convinced ``Sports
Night'' would have continued as a show about workplace issues, not
relationship issues.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of people named Felicity, The WB's ``Felicity,'' a
drama about a young woman's first year of college, got serious
consideration in this category but ultimately faltered because it,
too, couldn't get out of the romance rut.
</P>
<P>
   While we're at it, let's give ABC credit for keeping ``Whose
Line Is It, Anyway?'' on the fall schedule. Because of its
spontaneous nature, improvisational comedy is a risky business, but
``Line'' is almost always good for a genuine laugh that's not
rooted in sitcom banality.
</P>
<P>
   Best new series to be
</P>
<P>
   renewed, cable division:
</P>
<P>
   Sing it loud, sing it proud: ``The Sopranos.'' This superbly
cast mobster-in-analysis drama was an idea that Fox passed up a few
seasons ago, which is just more proof that you, too _ or maybe that
slug munching the vegetation out back _ could be a network
programming executive.
</P>
<P>
   To be suitable for network consumption, ``The Sopranos'' would
have to lose the bad language and nudity that HBO can get away
with, but the parallel stories of a mob capo struggling with two
dysfunctional families is the sort of thing networks should be
embracing, not rejecting.
</P>
<P>
   Best new cast member:
</P>
<P>
   Some of us thought Steven Bochco was squeezin' our shoes with
the announcement that Rick Schroder would replace Jimmy Smits in
the cast of ``NYPD Blue.'' But as they say in the patois of the
15th precinct, with respect to the Emmy, I'm likin' Schroder for
it.
</P>
<P>
   Best example of
</P>
<P>
   colorful scheduling
</P>
<P>
   In announcing its 1999-2000 schedule last month, Fox left ``The
PJs'' off its fall list, even though Eddie Murphy's gentle satire
of life in the projects had better Nielsen ratings than Matt
Groening's animated sci-fi comedy, ``Futurama,'' which is returning
in the fall in the cushy Sunday night spot after ``The Simpsons.''
</P>
<P>
   Surely it has nothing to do with race. (``Futurama'' is a
production of Twentieth Century Fox TV, Fox's own studio. ``The
PJs,'' which is on Fox's midseason replacement list, is made by Ron
Howard's Imagine Television, which is affiliated with Disney, which
owns ABC.)
</P>
<P>
   Best ensemble:
</P>
<P>
   With each favorable mention of The WB's ``Buffy the Vampire
Slayer,'' I inevitably hear from a few cranks who think I've lost
my ball in the tall grass again. True, the title tends to scare
away people who can't believe good TV lurks behind something so
frivolously named. But there are some who agree that, week in and
week out, ``Buffy'' presents some of the best writing and acting on
the networks. The acting part is thanks to a fine cast that
routinely gets overlooked by the awards-show judges, so here, to
give credit where it's due, is the whole underappreciated lineup:
Sarah Michelle Gellar, Alyson Hannigan, Seth Green, Anthony Stewart
Head, Nicholas Brendon, David Boreanaz and Charisma Carpenter.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, things may never be the same after this season. Next fall,
Boreanaz and Carpenter will appear in a spinoff series, ``Angel.''
</P>
<P>
   Second place goes to the wonderful cast of ``The Practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Best supporting cast:
</P>
<P>
   I always liked Fred and Ethel better than I loved Lucy and
Ricky. Same goes for Jack and Karen of ``Will &AMP; Grace.''
</P>
<P>
   It might not be polite to steal scenes, but Sean Hayes and Megan
Mullally do it regularly and with my complete approval as Jack
McFarland and Karen Walker. With exquisite timing and fabulous
physical comedy skills, Hayes and Mullally are naturally funnier
than the show's stars, Eric McCormack and Debra Messing.
</P>
<P>
   Best miniseries:
</P>
<P>
   For four Sundays in April, A&AMP;E was the place to catch a spirited
and stunningly photographed quartet of C.S. Forester's ``Horatio
Hornblower'' stories. Ioan Gruffudd's portrayal of a young naval
officer during the Napoleonic Wars was crisp and clean, devoid of
the melodrama so often associated with such period pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Best voice since Bacall:
</P>
<P>
   It's a tossup between Andrea Thompson (Jill Kirkendall on ``NYPD
Blue'') and Angie Harmon (Abbie Carmichael on ``Law &AMP; Order'').
Thompson's voice is closer to Lauren Bacall's _ a sort of low
rumble that seems to rise from her toes. Harmon's is more the
husky, whiskey-and-smoke type reminiscent of Demi Moore. Either
way, a voice that commands attention.
</P>
<P>
   Best role reversal:
</P>
<P>
   In season two, ``Ally McBeal'' star Calista Flockhart (with an
assist from David E. Kelley) changed an appealingly complex woman
into an angry, mean-spirited harpy.
</P>
<P>
   Best misuse of artistic license
</P>
<P>
   NBC's ``Noah's Ark,'' for a bad rewrite of Genesis.

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Like many old-style Mexican matriarchs, Emma
Castro Amador bore so many children that she cannot keep their
birthdays straight. Sometimes she even loses track of whether
Oscar, her 10th, came before David, her 11th.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I never regret having so many,'' says Mrs. Castro, who is
59 and bore 14 children in 25 years. ``I know the government tells
everybody to have fewer now, but I think its none of their
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Castro's offspring, however, have a different view. In a
generational divide repeated in millions of Mexican families, all
14 say they are determined to limit their own families to two or
three children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Small families live better,'' says Gloria Munoz Castro, Mrs.
Castro's eldest daughter, repeating the jingle, broadcast
incessantly on television here for 25 years, after the government
reversed its its stance in 1974 to put a brake on exploding growth.
She has two children and says she will have no more.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, Mexico's population is projected to reach 100
million, and the contrast between Mrs. Castro's family and those of
her children illustrates the extraordinary changes underway in the
country's family and population patterns, which hold important
consequences for the rest of North America.
</P>
<P>
   Because Mexican women like Mrs. Castro traditionally had so many
children, the population has quintupled since 1940, and will
continue to surge at about 1 million people a year for nearly three
decades. But because of people like her daughter, many forecasters
predict that slowing fertility rates will mean that the country's
population will virtually stop growing by 2045.
</P>
<P>
   The tremendous reduction in fertility, from 7 children per woman
in 1965 to 2.5 today, has brought a significant drop in the number
of dependent children supported by each worker. That is offering
Mexico what population experts call a ``demographic bonus,'' the
opportunity to generate higher savings rates and domestic
investments that can bring rapid development if the bonus is
managed shrewdly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The drop in fertility is a spectacular change that has meant a
revolution in mental attitudes,'' said Dr. Rodolfo Tuiran
Gutierrez, secretary general of Mexico's government-run National
Population Council. ``It's opening a demographic window of
opportunity for Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   Around the world, fertility rates have fallen from an average of
4.95 children per woman in the 1960-1965 period to 2.96 children in
the first half of the '90s. Similar to Mexico, Brazil, another
large developing Latin country, the rate by which women are bearing
children is falling. Comparable data shows a fertility rate of 2.4
children per woman, a 60 percent decline from the mid-1960s.
</P>
<P>
   But fast-growing populations are like speeding locomotives that
cannot brake slowly, and even though Mexican birth rates fell
dramatically, the population has continued to surge.
</P>
<P>
   For now, unemployment will remain high, since even when the
economy is robust it cannot provide jobs for the 1.3 million new
workers who enter the job market each year. Many of the jobless
will continue to emigrate to the United States; over the next
decade, some 3.5 million Mexicans are projected to travel to the
United States to work and establish residence.
</P>
<P>
   When Emma Castro was born in 1940, Mexico's population was 19.6
million, little changed from what it had been in 1910, at the
outset of the Mexican Revolution. She married at 15 after a one-day
courtship, and bore her first son the following year, 1956. For the
next 25 years she bore one child, on average, every 21 months.
</P>
<P>
   Her experience was typical. In 1956, an American anthropologist,
Oscar Lewis, began collecting an oral history of a poor Mexico City
family, later published as ``The Children of Sanchez.'' When Lewis
first interviewed the patriarch, Jesus Sanchez, he had four
children, but when Mexican reporters interviewed him 14 years
later, Hernandez had fathered 16 more children.
</P>
<P>
   Government policy encouraged rapid growth, partly for historical
reasons. Mexicans believed that the 19th Century seizure of Mexican
territories stretching from Texas to California by the United
States would have been impossible had they not been so sparsely
populated.
</P>
<P>
   But in the late 1960s, as Mexico's postwar economic boom began
to slow, the population figures began to alarm experts. In 1970,
Mexico's population hit 48 million, and in an influential study
several prominent Mexican demographers warned that unless policies
changed it would more than triple by the year 2000, to 148 million.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with the challenge to national stability those projections
implied, President Luis Echeverria Alvarez in 1974 reversed course,
establishing a National Population Council to control population
growth and a network of government clinics to help couples plan
their families.
</P>
<P>
   The reversal came as women's attitudes about birth control were
already changing; ignoring the government and the Roman Catholic
hierarchy, many women in the 1960s and early 1970s were buying
contraceptives on the black market. As a result, the government's
new offer of family planning services began satisfying a repressed
demand, and Mexican families began changing dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``We were determined to have just two,'' said Munoz Castro, who
married in 1977. ``We didn't want to spend all our money just to
feed and clothe children.''
</P>
<P>
   Several of Gloria's married siblings and in-laws have no
children. Eira Hernandez Ramirez, a 39-year-old sister-in-law,
explained her childlessness: ``Food is expensive, the oil is
running out, water is scarce,'' she said. ``The future's just too
bleak.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But even though Mexican birth rates have plummeted, the
population has continued to expand. Although none of Emma Castro's
14 children have borne nearly as many children as she did, they
have produced 23 grandchildren. And millions of others in their
generation have formed new families, too. That is why the
population surged from 66.8 million in 1980 to 81 million in 1990
and is projected to reach 100 million next year.
</P>
<P>
   For more than two decades, the economy has failed to keep up
with the exploding population. Jean Maninat, director of the Mexico
office of the International Labor Organization, said that about 1.3
million new workers join Mexico's job market each year.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the population pressure,'' Maninat said. ``And despite
the government's efforts to generate investments, never in any year
has the economy created that many jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   In good years, the expanding economy and new investments can
create 900,000 or perhaps 1 million new jobs, leaving about 300,000
new job seekers unemployed. In 1995, a recession year, Mexico lost
500,000 jobs, meaning that together with the 1.3 million new
job-seekers, the ranks of the the unemployed grew by a total of 1.8
million.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico has accumulated at least 12 million unemployed since
population growth began to overwhelm the economy.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   A vast army of other Mexicans are sort-of-employed in the
informal sector, the platoons of windshield washers who converge on
cars at street corners and battalions of chewing gum vendors who
clog downtown sidewalks.
</P>
<P>
   Still others have emigrated to the United States. During the
1960s, only about 27,000 workers left Mexico each year to establish
permanent residence in the United States, according to Mexican
government figures. Today, it is currently about 277,000 a year,
according to the migration study.
</P>
<P>
   For the next 10 years or so, population growth is expected to
continue to generate mass emigration and millions of new
unemployed. But as the effects of the dropoff in fertility rates
continue, the number of people who join the job market each year is
projected to fall to about 650,000 in 2010, government demographers
estimate.
</P>
<P>
   If the economy continues to grow, then the number of Mexicans
who emigrate to the United States each year, legally and illegally,
could begin to decline, according to the migration study. But some
demographers believe that because wages in the United States are
often 10 times as high as they are here for the same work, Mexicans
will continue to emigrate even when jobs are available here.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The slowing growth is bringing Mexico good news of another kind.
In 1970, for every 100 Mexican workers there were 100 dependents,
mostly children and a few retired people. As the children have
grown up and entered the work force, this ``dependency ratio'' has
declined, to about 60 dependents for each 100 workers. By the year
2020, the burden of non-working dependents should decline still
further, to about 40 per 100 workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a moment in the evolution of populations when they
have the absolute best structure for development, and that's the
structure Mexico is developing right now,'' said Eduardo Arriaga,
an Argentine demographer who is a lecturer at Georgetown
University.
</P>
<P>
   This demographic bonus gives Mexico the opportunity to increase
domestic savings and with sensible economic management, could
result in higher per-capita economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   The bonus phase of Mexico's demographic transition is expected
to last for 30 years. By then, the population will be, on average,
far older than it is today, and millions of Mexicans will need
retirement care.
</P>
<P>
   The costs of caring for the elderly will be higher, because most
retired Mexicans now live with their children. But because the
characteristically large Mexican family is shrinking, increasing
numbers of Mexicans live alone, and in the future the elderly may
not be able to count on home care provided by their children.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mexican family is being transformed in crucial ways,''
said Carlos Welti, a demographer at Mexico's National Autonomous
University. ``Throughout our history, an important social safety
network has been the extended family, uncles, cousins. In the
future, fewer will have these relationships.''

COSIC SAYS PEACE IS ILLUSORY, AND MILOSEVIC WILL SUFFER BADLY 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ Dobrica Cosic, a former president of
Yugoslavia and a figure revered among Serbian nationalists, says
that any peace in Kosovo will be illusory, and that the reputation
of the current oresident, Slobodan Milosevic, will suffer badly
because of Serbia's defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Cosic, a former Partisan fighter and a popular novelist of
Serbian history, sees Kosovo as lost to Serbia. He judges the
outcome of ``this unequal and senseless war'' as a historic tragedy
that cannot endure, because it is not based on any real democratic
or territorial compromise. And he predicts that despite the
presence of international troops, Kosovo will destabilize the
Balkans for many years to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Kosovo crisis has not been solved with this American
diktat and the European Union's obedient concurrence,'' Cosic said
in a rare interview. ``This will be an illusory peace that will
endanger the stability of the Balkans and of Europe itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Cosic, 78, is a compact man with thick white hair, who is wary
of the press and who is guarded by his daughter, who also works as
his secretary.
</P>
<P>
   As early as 1968, Cosic challenged the notion that the
nationalities question had been solved in Tito's Yugoslavia. He
argued that Kosovo remained a terrible dilemma, and he was the
first person from inside the Communist Party to say what many knew:
that the majority Albanians were pushing out the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   For his outspokenness, he was purged from the party Central
Committee and stripped even of his party membership. He became a
well-known writer and gave moral and monetary support to dissident
intellectuals representing a variety of points of view.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly 20 years, he has called for a negotiated division of
Kosovo between Serbs and Albanians, but neither side has been
interested in giving up its claims to the whole province. Still, he
says, ``a just and lasting solution of the Kosovo crisis can only
be found in a compromise between the two antagonistic national
interests _ Serbian and Albanian.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, with the support of Milosevic, who was in political
difficulty after the imposition of international sanctions and
needed nationalist cover, Cosic was elected president of
Yugoslavia. But he was not a hardened politician, and Milosevic
maneuvered Parliament into impeaching him on June 1, 1993, in a
single day.
</P>
<P>
   Some dissident intellectuals now resent him for setting the
nationalist stage for Milosevic, by reviving the importance of
Kosovo and making it new for this generation of Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Cosic said an artificial protectorate over
Kosovo would not resolve the fundamental clash of ethnic interests
there or produce democracy in a province that most Serbs will now
abandon, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Serbs and Albanians in Kosovo can reconcile, after so
much violence and ethnic purging, Cosic said: ``It cannot be a
serene life, not even under the protection of NATO and a U.N.
gendarmerie. All the displaced Albanians will not return to their
burned homes, nor will displaced and desperate Serbs return to live
under the rule of the majority Albanians.''
</P>
<P>
   More bluntly, he said, ``Only a lunatic could believe that after
such a terrible civil war and terrible destruction that the two
nations can live together.'' The fate of the Serbs in Kosovo ``is
no longer a political or a psychological question,'' he said.
``There will be revenge, and it will be impossible for NATO to stop
it, even if they sent in psychologists instead of policemen.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as the 1995 Dayton accords did not produce a multi-ethnic
Bosnia, he said, this new protectorate ``will not result in a
multi-ethnic Kosovo, and the province will inevitably separate from
Serbia.''
</P>
<P>
   The Albanians have the right to create their own unified state,
he says, while the Serbs must have the right to protect their holy
sites and interests. He sees the best outcome in a sort of
Scandinavia of the Balkans, where small, mostly Serbian states are
created around Serbian monasteries and enclaves, on the model of
Andorra or the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
   Among his books are a well-received trilogy, ``Time of Death,''
about Serbia's terrible history in World War I, when as many as one
in every four people died. Cosic also wrote ``Divisions,''
considered the best tale of the royalist Chetniks, who lost to
Tito's Partisans. A novel about a young Partisan fighter, ``The Sun
is Far Away,'' was required reading in high schools.
</P>
<P>
   The hero of that book is ordered by the Partisans to leave his
village to fight the Germans. He chooses to fight them at home, but
is executed for violating communist principles and caring too much
about his family and land. Cosic was praised for at least showing
the moral dilemma of party discipline.
</P>
<P>
   No fan of Milosevic, Cosic believes that no Yugoslav politician
involved in this Kosovo defeat will emerge with his reputation
intact. But how long Milosevic remains in power, he said, greatly
depends on the policies of the West. ``While Serbia is kept
isolated and under a blockade, while the Serbs are demonized in the
media, while there is no justice for Serbs in the international
community,'' he said, ``Serbia cannot be constituted as a modern
democratic state with new politics and new people.''
</P>
<P>
   A well-known Serbian nationalist poet, Matija Beckovic, who
refused to be interviewed by this correspondent, once said that
``Kosovo is the most expensive word in the Serbian language.''
</P>
<P>
   With so many deaths, the word has become even more expensive.
</P>
<P>
   But this defeat, and Serbian ethnic purging of Albanians, may
also puncture the romantic notion of Serbian history that all
Serbian wars are ones of self-liberation or self-identity, and not
wars of conquest. The loss of Kosovo, some suggest, may force the
Serbs to seek another form of self-definition as a more typical,
largely homogenous European state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe Serbs are entitled to their sense of an honorable
defeat,'' Cosic said, but they will also feel that their ideology
contains ``a certain anachronism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It will only be peace that will show us what this war really
meant and the consequences it has produced,'' he said. ``It is the
first international conflict to resist the post-communist,
triumphalist hegemony of the U.S.A.''
</P>
<P>
   But the real challenge for the future, Cosic said, is how
democracy will deal with the demands for statehood from every
minority. Kosovo, he says, is an example of the global rhetoric of
human rights' justifying and cloaking a new separatism.
</P>
<P>
   Even the nonviolent Kosovo Albanian leader, Ibrahim Rugova, ``is
regarded in the West as a fighter for human rights, while he was
simply smuggling in his separatist ideals.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very afraid of the retrograde energy of all these
particularisms and of the artificial unification that globalization
brings,'' he said. ``The 20th century will end trying to resolve
these contradictions.''

 UNDATED: a year.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Normally speakers that size are able to produce only a narrow
swath of sound in the middle of the frequency range, where human
voice falls. If voices sound nasal, or tinny, it is largely because
the bass frequencies are missing.
</P>
<P>
   These frequencies are not missing on the Bose Wave Radio. Bose
says it has solved the problem by designing a complex, twisting
sound baffle that wends around for 27 inches, back and forth,
through the body of the small tabletop radio, whose exterior
measurements are only about 14 inches wide by 9 inches deep by 4
inches high. Looking at a diagram of this ``wave guide,'' as Bose
calls it, brings to mind high-school biology class diagrams of the
inner ear.
</P>
<P>
   The wave guide works the same way a pipe organ does, noted
William R. Short, a Bose fellow. It uses a precise volume of air to
amplify the vibrations of the speaker cone. The vibrations of the
cone vibrate the air in the baffle, too. ``It matches the motion of
the air with the motion of the speaker,'' Short said.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, the wave guide seems to work. I've had a Wave Radio
for review for several weeks, and I've listened to FM radio and to
a variety of CDs I already knew to be sonically (as well as
musically) pleasing. And the clear, visceral impression is that the
music is richer and fuller than anyone would normally expect from a
radio, of all things _ especially one this size.
</P>
<P>
   No, the Wave Radio does not produce thunderous bass that shakes
the cabinet doors. On the top end of the spectrum, the high treble
that comes from cymbals, bells, triangles and some strings sounds a
bit muted. But the truth is, on most home radios you probably
wouldn't even know that the high treble was there. And the bass
would be a mere suggestion, not an appreciable part of the music.
</P>
<P>
   Accurate music production is not the result just of frequency
response. Most full-range audio systems also play certain
frequencies at higher volumes than others, leading to overblown
bass or harsh, strident treble. But the Bose radio manages to
reproduce fairly smooth sound across the spectrum. I was not able
to measure it, but the music sounded relatively uniform _ or
``flat,'' using the jargon of the trade _ from low bass to high
treble.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a radio that sounds quite pleasing _ surprisingly,
given its size. It was also able to play at higher volumes than
most other small radios, without distortion, or ``clipping,'' from
the speakers.
</P>
<P>
   The Bose Wave radio cannot compete with any serious stereo
system with separate speakers and an FM tuner: housing both
speakers in one 14-inch cabinet greatly diminishes the stereo
effect. But this is a clock radio with all the functions of one,
including a snooze button. It is intended primarily for use in the
bedroom or the kitchen, where high-quality sound is not usually
found. For that, the Wave Radio is quite expensive. But it is also
unique and adept.

POPE USES ENCYCLICAL ON FAITH TO DEFEND COPERNICUS
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORUN, Poland _ In 1543, the Polish astronomer Copernicus sent
his revolutionary thesis on the movement of the planets to Rome
with a poignant letter seeking understanding from Pope Paul III. He
never received a reply.
</P>
<P>
   Pope John Paul II, a former philosophy professor, gave an answer
Monday all too familiar to academics. He replied, in essence, read
my book.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I wrote in the encyclical Fides et Ratio'' (Faith and
Reason), the pope told a thousand Polish academics and scientists
gathered in a lecture hall at Copernicus University here,
``deprived of reason, faith has stressed feeling and experience,
and so runs the risk of no longer being a universal proposition.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope used his most recent encyclical to defend Copernicus,
who was born in Torun and whose ``On the Movement of Heavenly
Bodies'' was denounced by the Vatican in 1616 and removed from the
Vatican's index of forbidden books only in 1822. ``Although
Copernicus himself saw his discovery as giving rise to even greater
amazement at the Creator of the world and the power of human
reason,'' the pope said, ``many people took it as a means of
setting reason against faith.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope, 79, who has returned to his native Poland for the
eighth visit of his papacy, once again took time to meet with old
colleagues and former students and bask in the close-knit Polish
academic world that formed him as a scholar as well as a priest. It
was the pope's first opportunity to explain his encyclical,
published in October, to some of the scholars he trusts the most.
He argues that modern philosophy has lost its grounding in human
values and the quest for spiritual truth, and urged his fellow
Poles to teach their students to seek hope, not ``nihilism.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope provided a context that has particular resonance for
his generation of scholars and theologians, many of whom were
persecuted by the Nazis and the Communists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does not the history of our century, with its wars, its
criminal totalitarian ideologies, its concentration camps and
gulags, make it easy for us to yield to the temptation of
discouragement and despair?'' he asked. He quoted Pascal to respond
that, ``In order to discover hope, we need to lift our gaze on
high.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the third stop in a grueling day of Masses and special
prayer services in this northern region of Poland, where World War
II began in 1939. But it was clear that the pope relished his brief
return to academia, where he was given standing ovations by
university rectors from all over the country, many of whom wore
velvet caps and ermine-trimmed robes that have not changed since
the time of Copernicus. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After his speech, he was presented by the rector of Jagiellonian
University in Krakow with a 50th anniversary copy of the doctoral
degree in theology he received there in 1948. The pope eagerly took
hold of the scroll, unrolled it and slowly and carefully read it,
to the delight of his audience. As he left, he exclaimed, ``Vivat
academia! Vivat professores!'' Those Latin phrases, popular in the
Middle Ages, are still the anthem of Polish academia. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a little older and weaker, but he is still the same
person, with a beautiful memory for names and faces,'' said Andrzej
Szostek, who studied ethics under the pope when he was Cardinal
Karol Wojtyla at the Catholic University of Lublin and who is now
that university's rector.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Szostek, who teaches ethics, said that Polish universities, even
non-Catholic ones, were not overrun with the moral relativist
philosophers fashionable in Europe and the United States, but that
the pope's message was nevertheless needed. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The general tendency is not as strong in Poland, but we are
influenced by contemporary Western thought,'' he said. ``The pope
is a very good observer, not only of social and spiritual matters
but also intellectual life.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The pope ended his day on a more somber contemporary note. After
beatifying Stefan Frelichowski, a local priest who died at the
Dachau extermination camp and is considered a martyr to Nazi
persecution, the pope linked that war with one still raging nearby,
in the Balkans. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I speak these words in a land that in its history experienced
the tragic effects of the lack of peace, having been victim of a
cruel and ruinous war,'' he told 200,000 followers gathered in a
field at the Torun airport. ``How much innocent blood is being shed
under our very eyes? We are witnesses to how strongly people cry
out for and yearn for peace. The tragic events in Kosovo have shown
us this and are still showing us this so painfully.''

A NEW TITLEHOLDER FOR WORLD'S TALLEST TREE
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By MIKE GENIELLA   
 Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UKIAH, Calif. _ A strapping prince of a redwood growing in
splendid isolation 12 miles west of Ukiah now holds the title of
being the world's tallest tree.
</P>
<P>
   Towering 367.5 feet, the ``Mendocino Tree'' at remote Montgomery
Woods State Reserve has been officially decreed the tallest living
thing by state park rangers and the San Francisco-based Save the
Redwoods League.
</P>
<P>
   The honor until recently had been held by the older and more
massive ``Tall Tree'' in Redwood National Park in Del Norte County,
which once stood 367.8 feet tall. But the aging tree lost 10 feet
during a recent winter storm, dropping it from the top 10 list of
the tallest trees found around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   Results of the new measurements, done in mid-March by a team led
by Humboldt State University professor Steve Sillet, were
documented on videotape and authenticated by the ``Guinness Book of
World Records.''
</P>
<P>
   But until now, the results have been closely guarded by state
park rangers and Save the Redwoods League because of fears an
influx of curiosity seekers might trample a fragile environment
that for centuries has nourished the new champion, estimated to be
600 to 800 years old. The tree is about 100 miles north of San
Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Park rangers say there will be no official marker identifying
the Mendocino Tree, which despite its grandeur is barely
distinguishable from an 80-acre cluster of two dozen or more
surrounding big trees standing 350 feet or taller. Nearby is the
so-called ``Swamp Tree,'' whose 363.4-foot height also makes it one
of the tallest trees in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The Montgomery Woods giants are encircled by a mile-long path
looping through sorrel and sword ferns and bordered by wild iris
and columbine.
</P>
<P>
   Access is limited by a steep and winding county-maintained road
with a series of hairpin turns that are virtually impossible to
navigate in RVs or tour buses. The area has no camping facilities,
although the nearby clothing-optional Orr Hot Springs offers rustic
lodging.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Montgomery Woods is the least visited of Mendocino
County's redwood preserves. Some local residents determined to keep
it that way have started tearing down roadside state park signs in
hopes of keeping the reserve's isolation to themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Supervising state park ranger Karl Poppelreiter said he was not
happy with the vandalism but could understand why the reserve has
become a local icon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Montgomery Woods is a truly unique place. I'm even worried
about the attention the tallest tree might bring to it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Save the Redwoods League representatives expressed similar
sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The measuring of the new tallest tree is an exciting reminder
of the longevity and value of the redwood ecosystem. But we
sincerely hope visitors to the reserve can appreciate the tree
without jeopardizing its health and long-term survival,'' said
league spokeswoman Marti Harris.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Poppelreiter said while the 1,300-acre Montgomery Woods reserve
was relatively small compared to other state and federal redwood
parks, it was the most ecologically significant grove of ancient
redwoods between Santa Cruz and Mendocino counties. ``It's is an
extremely unique and sensitive area,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   By age alone, the Mendocino Tree is a prince among the ancient
redwoods preserved in California parks. Many of the giants are
older and sometimes twice as large in circumference as the
Mendocino Tree.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest known redwood is the ``Del Norte Titan'' in Jedediah
Smith Redwoods State Park. Although only 307 feet tall, it measures
23.6 feet in diameter at its base. If logged and milled, it could
produce enough lumber to build nearly 40 houses.
</P>
<P>
   But thanks to a microclimate that experts say is unique to
Montgomery Woods, the Mendocino Tree towers above all others.
</P>
<P>
   Tucked in a ruggedly remote area between Ukiah and the Mendocino
Coast, the Mendocino Tree and the other giants in Montgomery Woods
are viewed as living testaments to Mendocino County's redwood
heritage.
</P>
<P>
   Mendocino County was once considered the heart of a redwood
ecosystem that scientists say dates back 200 million years. But
after decades of logging because of the county's proximity to urban
markets, its once verdant redwood forests have been stripped of
trees big enough to merit attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt that a walk through Montgomery Woods is like
taking a step back into time,'' Poppelreiter said.

BRAIN REVEALS POWER TO REPAIR ITSELF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Boston scientists, experimenting on mice, have shown that they
can repair widespread brain damage by implanting a kind of
uncommitted, all-purpose ``stem cell'' that migrates through the
brain and spawns the needed replacement cells.
</P>
<P>
   The findings raise new hopes for treating devastating conditions
such as multiple sclerosis and diseases that cause severe
retardation in children, and possibly Alzheimer's disease and other
degenerative brain disorders and strokes.
</P>
<P>
   All these problems result from the death or absence of, or
damage to, neurons, the nerve cells that make up the ``white
matter'' of the brain.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, scientists thought it would be difficult, if not
impossible, to replace malfunctioning cells scattered throughout
the brain. So they have focused on implanting healthy cells in
brains of people with disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, that
are caused by damage to small, circumscribed areas of brain cells.
</P>
<P>
   But in a new report, researchers at Children's Hospital and
Harvard Medical School say they may have overcome that longstanding
barrier, at least in an animal model. They injected versatile
neural ``stem cells'' into newborn mice with widespread brain
damage that made them shiver uncontrollably.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, the stem cells _ ``progenitor'' cells with
offspring that can be any kind of brain cell _ migrated throughout
the brain. And, responding to some precise but unknown signal, they
spawned the exact kind of cell the mouse brains lacked and repaired
the nerve damage. The report says that the repairs dramatically
reduced the shaking in 60 percent of the animals.
</P>
<P>
   The report is in the Proceedings of the National Academy of
Sciences. The authors are Drs. Booma D. Yandava, Lori L.
Billinghurst, and Evan Y. Snyder.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's exciting. I'm very positive about this,'' said Ronald
McKay, a scientist at the National Institute of Neurological
Disorders and Stroke, which is helping finance the research. ``It's
not a cure for multiple sclerosis, and it's not in (mice) adults,
but it's a very interesting step'' in the effort to engineer cells
to repair a wide range of brain disorders and injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder, the senior author, said although clinical tests in
people are years away, he has begun putting human neural stem cells
into mice in experiments designed to show that human cells have the
same ability to migrate all over the brain.
</P>
<P>
   The key player in this process, the neural stem cell, is a
``totipotential'' cell that hasn't become committed to any
particular role, and can spawn all kinds of brain cells _ including
more stem cells. Scientists have found stem cells (of different
kinds, depending on the organ they reside in) in many other organs
of the body. In addition, researchers recently isolated embryonic
stem cells that form soon after conception, which can give rise to
any type of cell in the body.
</P>
<P>
   Although stem cells are abundant in the developing fetus, they
also can be found in adult human and animal brains, Snyder said.
The discovery of neural stem cells in the last decade suggested
that here was a source of healthy new cells to repair damage _ much
as blood stem cells are transplanted into patients whose own
blood-forming bone marrow cells have been destroyed by disease or
by cancer chemotherapy. ``This is like a bone marrow transplant for
the brain,'' said Snyder, who is an assistant professor of
neurology in the pediatrics department at Children's.
</P>
<P>
   The neural stem cells for the experiment came from the brains of
4-day-old mice. They were implanted into a strain of mice known as
``shiverers'' because of their constant shakiness: The cause is a
gene mutation that results in many nerve cells lacking the normal
sheath of myelin, a protein that acts like the insulation on an
electric line. Multiple sclerosis, an often progressive and
disabling disease, also is caused by a lack of myelin sheathing on
nerves.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder said he implanted the neural stem cells into the sick
mice just after they were born because at that stage neural stem
cells are normally migrating throughout the developing brain.
Therefore, it was more likely that the implanted cells would spread
through the brain tissue and make repairs.
</P>
<P>
   The stem cells differentiated into the kind of cells, called
oligodendrocytes, that were missing in the ``shiverer'' mice.
Snyder said the results suggested that the brains somehow signaled
to the stem cells that oligodendrocytes were needed.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Struggling to rescue the imperiled Kosovo peace
process, President Clinton and his Russian counterpart Boris
Yeltsin ordered their top diplomats to try to craft a resolution on
the matter to go to the United Nations Security Council as early as
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The diplomats _ meeting with foreign ministers from other
so-called G-8 countries in Bonn _ spent eight hours hashing over
resolution language Monday and were scheduled to reconvene early
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to press the talks toward closure, Clinton called Yeltsin
to stress that peace is at hand and to ask for Moscow's help in
nailing down language for a Security Council resolution embracing
the peace accord Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic accepted last
Thursday but has yet to implement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very constructive call,'' White House spokesman Joe
Lockhart told reporters. He said the two leaders agreed to
authorize their top diplomats to work out their differences quickly
in Bonn and get the resolution before the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're trying to craft language for a U.N. Security Council
resolution that properly reflects the agreement that Milosevic has
accepted,'' said Mike Hammer, a spokesman at the White House for
the National Security Council. ``We think that will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Five days after agreeing to pull out his forces from Kosovo,
Milosevic, president of Yugoslavia, continued to balk at NATO's
terms for withdrawal on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials made good on their pledge to intensify their air
attacks, ramping up the sortie level to more than 200 strike
missions overnight Monday. They targeted radio relay towers, ammo
dumps and field forces from Kosovo northward into Serbia proper.
</P>
<P>
   After flying 93 strike sorties concentrating on Serb forces in
the field in Kosovo on Sunday, U.S. and allied pilots were
scheduled to fly ``two to three times'' that many overnight Monday,
said Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I anticipate that you'll see an intensification over the next
few days,'' Bacon told reporters at the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stay tuned,'' he said. ``Time will tell.''
</P>
<P>
   As NATO returned to an all-out war footing, diplomatic efforts
intensified in Bonn.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and his NATO allies were hopeful that U.N. adoption of
the resolution would clear the way for the continuation of talks
between NATO and Serb commanders over the withdrawal of all Serb
troops, police and paramilitary forces from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   High level talks over the pull-out broke down Sunday after Serb
officials rejected NATO's terms.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic spoke by telephone Monday with Finnish President
Martti Ahtisaari, who passed word to diplomats meeting in Germany
that the Serb leader intends to comply with the peace accord he
accepted last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Milosevic says he intends to go forward with the agreement,''
State Department spokesman James Rubin told reporters in Bonn,
where Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is leading U.S.
negotiations over the Security Council resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic agreed last Thursday to pull out Serb forces from
Kosovo and permit an international peacekeeping force to police the
war-torn province.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement called for that force, as well as a group of
civilian organizations, to operate inside Kosovo under U.N.
auspices. U.S. officials interpreted the breakdown of the military
talks to suggest that Milosevic wants to see the Security Council
resolution before making good on his pledge to withdraw Serb forces
from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't the sequence NATO had in mind last Thursday.
Instead, they anticipated a relatively quick Serb troop withdrawal,
followed by a NATO bombing halt and then a U.N. Security Council
resolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``The schedule has now been disturbed,'' Russian Foreign
Minister Igor Ivanov told reporters in Bonn. As a result, he said,
``wording of the resolution has become difficult, and we are
continuing to work on it.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL ADD FOLLOWS
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Albright and Ivanov met for eight hours Monday in Bonn with
their six counterparts from Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy
and Japan _ the so-called Group of Eight major democratic powers _
to try to hammer out language for a 20-point Security Council
resolution. Talks were scheduled to resume early Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have managed to solve 17,'' of the issues, said German
Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer. ``We do hope that we will clear
those (remaining) points tomorrow, so that we can get a
constructive work to the Security Council and that we can take a
decision in the Security Council.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the outstanding issues was whether to stipulate in the
resolution that the peacekeeping force would be led by NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Russia is opposed to that. Russians share close historical and
cultural ties with their Slavic kin, the Serbs, and have tried to
back Milosevic's demands for a watered-down U.N. security force
that would be largely unarmed.
</P>
<P>
   NATO, however, has insisted that the force be a robust combat
contingent led by the trans-Atlantic alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 48,000 troops anticipated to make up the force, NATO
countries have pledged 44,000 troops. Another 4,000 have been
pledged by NATO partner countries.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops are also anticipated, but Moscow has not yet
pledged forces.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials reiterated Monday that the force would be
NATO-led.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not negotiable,'' said Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't certain, though, that NATO leadership would be
stipulated in the Security Council resolution. In essence, Russia
seeks ambiguity while the United States would prefer specificity.
Compromise language was seen as likely.
</P>
<P>
   A second issue was how to deal with the matter of Milosevic's
indictment by the U.N. war crimes tribunal. No mention of his
indictment was included in last Thursday's agreement. Some NATO
members reportedly were pressing for explicit mention in the
Security Council resolution, and Russia was balking.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials declined to confirm the third area of outstanding
disagreement.
</P>
<P>
   Low level communications continued Monday between Serb and NATO
commanders, but those talks were well below the decision-making
level, said Bacon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's primarily just to keep the phone lines open and the tea
water warm,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how soon NATO's bombing might end, Bacon reiterated that
it depends on how quickly Serb forces withdraw from Kosovo, a
matter that remains out of NATO's hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think predictions are worth the paper they're printed
on,'' said Bacon. ``At this stage, we just don't know.''

U.S. OFFICIALS STILL HOPEFUL THAT SNAGS IN PEACE ACCORD CAN BE
WORKED OUT
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Clinton administration officials expressed hope on
Monday that the snag in talks about the withdrawal of Yugoslav
troops from Kosovo would be resolved within the next several days.
</P>
<P>
   White House aides acknowledged that they had been excessively
optimistic immediately following the apparent agreement on Thursday
by President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia to allied terms for
ending the 10-week conflict. And they implied that they had
overreacted to the temporary breakdown in the talks in Macedonia on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Officials settled on a more neutral tone on Monday, advising
patience and wariness as diplomats from NATO, Russia and the United
Nations seek a formula for the withdrawal of the Serbian troops
from Kosovo and the entry of an allied peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   The White House blamed Milosevic for the breakdown. ``We have
been down the road with Milosevic before and we understand some of
the tactics that he employs from time to time,'' said Joe Lockhart,
the White House spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm trying to do is avoid the situation where we go to
one extreme or another. We have known all along that this is a
difficult process. We have used every means we could think of to
urge caution as we moved along, both on the euphoria and the
depression.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton spoke on Monday morning with President Boris
Yeltsin of Russia, who assured Clinton that Russia would not try to
undermine the terms of the peace agreement with Milosevic. The
agreement was reached last week with the help of Viktor
Chernomyrdin, Russia's special envoy for the Balkans, and President
Martti Ahtisaari of Finland.
</P>
<P>
   It calls for the rapid withdrawal of 40,000 Yugoslav troops from
the once largely autonomous Kosovo province of Serbia, which is the
main entity in Yugoslavia. The Yugoslav forces are to be replaced
with a 50,000-troop monitoring force under NATO command.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very constructive call,'' Lockhart said of the
Yeltsin-Clinton conversation. ``The two presidents affirmed that
implementation of Ahtisaari-Chernomyrdin document, accepted last
week by Milosevic, should form the basis for a peaceful settlement
of conflict and the suspension of NATO's air campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had no public comment Monday on the status of the
negotiations in Europe or the continuing NATO air strikes. Aides
said that he would refrain from making statements until there is
substantial progress or a dangerous collapse of the talks.
</P>
<P>
   In part to spur the negotiations, and in part to take advantage
of new opportunities to hit Yugoslav forces on the ground in
Kosovo, military officials planned new air raids.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon spokesman, Kenneth Bacon, said that NATO intended
on Monday evening to double or triple the 93 bombing missions that
NATO warplanes flew on Sunday. Other Pentagon officials said that
targets in and around Belgrade would be hit again after a three-day
hiatus.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon also warned against fears that the delay could scuttle the
deal. ``Just as there was reason not to be wildly optimistic on
Friday, there are reasons not to be wildly pessimistic today,'' he
said. ``This is a process.''
</P>
<P>
   Other administration officials and Western diplomats were
equally sanguine that Milosevic, after a certain amount of
negotiating, would honor the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Milosevic being Milosevic,'' said one administration
official with extensive experience in the Balkans. ``He's tough. He
makes you press for any gain. He probes for soft spots. And he's
willing to take a few more days of bombing to see if he can get a
better deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Defining that ``better deal'' from Milosevic's perspective, the
official said, ``Anything that waters down NATO's authority and
anything that leaves more Yugoslav security forces in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Galbraith, a former U.S. ambassador to Croatia, agreed,
saying, ``These are characteristic tactics: delay and seeking to
revise the agreement.'' Referring to the Yugoslav demand that the
U.N. Security Council approve a peacekeeping force before NATO
troops enter Kosovo, he said, ``The issue of the U.N. Security
Council Resolution is both face-saving and a delay tactic.''
</P>
<P>
   Holding out for a Security Council resolution also increases the
likelihood that Russia and China would publicly voice some support
for Yugoslavia that Milosevic could use as political cover
domestically and as a possible shield against some NATO demands.
</P>
<P>
   American and Western officials said the Yugoslav military
commanders may have some legitimate concerns, like trying to meet
NATO's demand to withdraw all 40,000 troops from Kosovo in phases
within seven days.
</P>
<P>
   But Balkan experts discounted any split between the military and
Milosevic, whom they said still holds on iron grip on the country's
military and security forces.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``The military is lockstep with Milosevic,'' an administration
official said. ``They're doing exactly what he tells them to do.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior American officer with experience in the Balkans said
any delay would have two secondary effects that Yugoslavia would
welcome.
</P>
<P>
   First, the longer the delay, the more the armored Serbian troops
in Kosovo can pound Albanian rebels. Bacon said on Monday that
pitched battles were under way between the lightly armed Kosovo
Liberation Army rebels and Yugoslav army forces around the Western
Kosovo town of Junik and at Mount Pastrik, on the border between
Kosovo and Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides had brought in reinforcements over the past few days,
Bacon said, as the rebels cling to territory against an aggressive
Yugoslav counteroffensive.
</P>
<P>
   Prolonging a final settlement, in Yugoslavia's view, would also
lessen the chances that the more than 800,000 Kosovo Albanians
expelled from the province would return.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon played down reports that Greece would block more than
2,000 Marines now aboard ships in the Aegean Sea from unloading at
the Greek port of Thessaloniki.
</P>
<P>
   The Greek government is under extraordinary domestic pressure
not to be seen as accommodating anything other than a peacekeeping
force and is likely to allow the marines to land and drive from the
port to staging areas in adjacent Macedonia only after a final
agreement is signed, Pentagon officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today a spokesman for the Greek government said that they
would be allowed to off-load and transit through Greece soon,''
Bacon said, without giving a date. ``We don't believe that there'll
be any problem with meeting the time lines.''

COMMENTARY: COCHRAN AND KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   You don't need to be Clausewitz to figure out what finally
brought Slobodan Milosevic to the negotiating table on NATO's terms
and why he is now stalling again. The answer to both questions is
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to understand Russia's critical role is to think of
a divorce proceeding: You are negotiating a divorce with your wife.
She has no lawyer and you have Johnnie Cochran. Every time your
wife asks for something, Cochran steps in to protect you with a
point of law. Things are going so well, you ask for a lunch break.
When you come back from lunch you find that Cochran has switched
sides and is now acting as your wife's lawyer, nodding in agreement
at all her demands. You're in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Russia is Johnnie Cochran in this story. It started out as
Milosevic's lawyer. But when Boris Yeltsin dismissed Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov last month it was a crucial turning point in the
war. Russia moved from being Milosevic's advocate over to NATO's
side of the table. The combination of that Russian switcheroo and
NATO's decision to really intensify the bombing and bring the war
home to the Serbian people was what brought Milosevic to deal. NATO
brought the roof down, and Russia pulled the rug out.
</P>
<P>
   The merciless air war was necessary to bring this Kosovo crisis
to a diplomatic solution. But it was not sufficient. Russia's
maneuvers were also critical; Milosevic certainly would have felt
emboldened to hang on longer if he thought he still had Russia on
his side.
</P>
<P>
   What is happening right now is that Milosevic, by delaying and
haggling, is making one last effort to restore Russia as his
lawyer, by giving time for those forces in Russia that hate this
deal _ namely the Gromykoites in the Russian Foreign Ministry, as
well as the nationalists and Communists _ to assert themselves and
get him better terms.
</P>
<P>
   That is why what is at stake here is both the future of the
Kosovo conflict and the future of U.S.-Russia relations. Boris
Yeltsin understands that. Yes, he may have one foot stuck in the
grave and one hand wrapped around a vodka bottle, but the reason he
sacked Primakov and brought in the pro-American Viktor Chernomyrdin
as his envoy was because of his gut belief that Russia's future
lies with integration with the West and the global economy.
</P>
<P>
   But Yeltsin is weak, and it's not clear he can impose his policy
on his own negotiators from the Russian Foreign Ministry. There is
a real fight going on now inside Moscow. Virtually the entire
political class in Russia today has turned anti-Western and
anti-American. They were moving that way before, and Kosovo
intensified the trend. The dominant school _ the Gromykoites,
nationalists and Communists _ are more than happy to see the U.S.
and NATO sink in the mud of the Balkans, particularly since NATO
has just been expanded into Russia's face. The minority school are
the Yeltsinites. These are the pro-Western democratic realists, who
believe Russia cannot get out of its own mudhole without domestic
reform and integration with the West. But they are on the
defensive.
</P>
<P>
   That is why if this deal comes together it is critical that the
United States and its NATO allies find a way to strengthen the
Yeltsinites. Because Boris is not going to be around much longer,
and there simply is no stable European security order without a
reasonably cooperative Russia. Indeed, there is no problem of the
post-Cold War era _ rogue states, loose nukes, weapons
proliferation, drugs or mafia _ that we can effectively address at
a tolerable price without the cooperation of Russia. Russia's tilt
our way was crucial against both Iraq and Serbia. The Czechs, Poles
and Hungarians buy us nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why the best way to strengthen the pro-Western,
democratic realists in Russia is to offer them something that would
be meaningful in their own internal struggles and would demonstrate
that cooperation with the West pays. NATO should declare at next
week's G-8 summit meeting that NATO expansion is now indefinitely
on hold and that NATO is ready to consider, under the right
conditions, bringing Russia in as a member. NATO should do now what
it should have done 10 years ago, and that is lay down a clear,
step-by-step pathway for bringing Russia into Europe. Russia is in
play _ so let's play.

IN JAKARTA, COUNTING THE VOTE IS A LABORIOUS BUT PRECIOUS EXERCISE
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DADAP, Indonesia _ As the ballot counting began on Monday in
this fishing village west of Jakarta, a crowd of eagle-eyed locals
encircled a makeshift polling place. They watched as workers
laboriously unfolded and called out each vote. It was a tedious
business, but nobody was complaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people are not my friends, so I'm watching to make sure
they don't do anything bad,'' said Hasanuddin Saman, 36, a
fisherman who had just voted in the first democratic election in
Indonesia during his lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   After more than three decades of strongman rule _ in which
elections were rigged affairs marked by ballot stuffing, payoffs
and intimidation _ Indonesians know how empty an election can be.
They see this vote as a precious opportunity for their country, and
they are determined to keep it clean.
</P>
<P>
   Former President Jimmy Carter and 600 other monitors, including
some from Australia, Europe and Japan, were also on hand to observe
the counting. But the outsiders were scarcely more vigilant than
people like Saman.
</P>
<P>
   ``The election today is a real election,'' he said without
averting his gaze from the counting table. ``The previous elections
were a joke. We always knew who was going to win before they even
started.''
</P>
<P>
   Saman allowed himself a smile. The voting in Dadap had been
peaceful. And with the ballots being counted in an orderly way, it
looked as if this village of 6,000 people on the northern coast of
Java would do its part to bring democracy to the world's
fourth-most-populous country.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time, it was free and fair,'' said Ramli, 52, after he
emerged from a voting booth constructed of bamboo and used rice
bags. Ramli, a construction worker who like many Indonesians uses
only one name, said: ``No one has bribed or intimidated us to vote
for any party. I don't miss the bribes.''
</P>
<P>
   Such comments attest to how fervently Indonesians yearn for a
change in their political system. With Indonesia's economy still in
a calamitous recession, villages like Dadap have tumbled into
poverty. Many people have lost their jobs. And the collapse of
Indonesia's currency, the rupiah, has demolished the purchasing
power of even those who still have work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have suffered tremendously,'' said Madi Taufan, 29, a
garment worker. ``Inflation is so high that our money can't buy
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet for all the hardship, nobody here seems to want to
return to the patronage of old-style Indonesian politics. In
previous elections, the ruling Golkar party of former President
Suharto used to pay for votes. Suharto's successor, B.J. Habibie,
hopes this election will confer new legitimacy on Golkar. But here,
at least, he seems likely to suffer a stinging repudiation.
</P>
<P>
   Dicky Ardi, 24, a courier who said he voted for a leading reform
candidate, Megawati Sukarnoputri, said, ``If Habibie stays
president, he won't put Suharto on trial. Suharto cannot be
forgiven for what he has done to this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Like other rural villages, Dadap was spared the riots and
looting that tore through Jakarta last May and precipitated
Suharto's resignation. But Monday one of the village elders said he
still feared that violence would break out during the voting. As he
surveyed the tranquil scene, with villagers lining up to vote while
their children cavorted in a muddy field, the man was visibly
relieved.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, an aging fisherman was repairing a bamboo net. He said
it would be victory enough if Indonesia held an election without
bloodshed, adding, ``I just pray that this will bring the country
together.''

RUSSIA HOLDS BACK ON ENDORSING RESOLUTION TO END KOSOVO CRISIS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: the 2nd take is scheduled to move by 9:15 p.m. ET)

 By JANE PERLEZ

<TEXT>
<P>
   COLOGNE, Germany _ After eight hours of negotiations, Russia
balked Monday at final approval of a resolution to be sent to the
Security Council to lay out the future of Kosovo and the role of
50,000 NATO peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   The draft resolution is being worked out by foreign ministers of
the leading industrial countries and Russia. Participants said much
progress had been made Monday, and perhaps 90 percent of the work
on the resolution has been agreed to.
</P>
<P>
   But problems about the role of NATO in the peacekeeping force
remain.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiators, especially Russia and the Europeans, want the
Security Council to approve such a resolution detailing the sketchy
document that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic agreed to last
week, which called for a U.N. role. The resolution is also meant to
give authority to the peacekeeping force and the civil
administration that is planned for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, said he needed to
have further consultations with Moscow. The Russians, through their
emissary Viktor Chermonyrdin, helped secure the agreement last
week. But if they change their mind and block a NATO dominated
force, under U.N. authority, that would be a setback to the peace
effort.
</P>
<P>
   Military to military talks in Macedonia to work out withdrawal
schedules for Yugoslav and Serbian troops from Kosovo were
downgraded to low level officials Monday, after the Yugoslavs made
what the State Department called unacceptable proposals to keep
15,000 soldiers in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But NATO held back on carrying out threats to intensify its
bombing of Yugoslavia if Belgrade did not promptly accept allied
terms on Kosovo. Allied officials said they hoped that the
restraint would help persuade Russia to back a United Nations
Security Council resolution on ending the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   But there was NATO bombing in Kosovo near the Albanian border,
and at night, explosions and anti-aircraft fire were heard once
again in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials here said they were satisfied that the
draft resolution made clear that the peacekeeping force of 50,000
will have a unified NATO command and control structure. The word
NATO may not be spelled out in the resolution, an official said,
but one section of the draft says that the operation will be
``performed by member states and relevant international
organizations.'
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic was told by Chernomyrdin and the Finnish President
Maarti Ahtisaari, that the phrase ``substantial NATO
participation'' in the document he agreed to last Thursday meant
``unified command and control,'' by NATO, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   The question of Russian participation in the peacekeeping force
still remained unresolved. Moscow has said it will not allow its
soldiers to work under a NATO command.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's accord with President Slobodan Milosevic of
Yugoslavia calls for all Yugoslav and Serbian police and military
to leave Kosovo. But Milosevic's troops appeared to be playing for
time in a last ditch effort ot drive ethnic Albanian guerrillas
from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The stalling by the Russians and the refusal by the Yugoslavs to
negotiate seriously on the withdrawal left an uncertain atmosphere
over how and when the Kosovo plan would move forward.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Gores and Clintons shared a stage for two hours
at the White House Conference on Mental Health on Monday, and took
turns interviewing people who have struggled with mental illness as
a patient, parent or researcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the last great stigma of the 20th century that we need
to make sure ends here and now,'' said Tipper Gore, who ran the
show. She recently revealed that she had been clinically depressed
after her son, Albert, nearly died when he was hit by a car in 1989
when he was 6. ``I was not myself,'' she said of her own
experience, until she sought medical help, including medication.
``I'm happy to say that it worked.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton asked Congress on Monday to ensure that
Americans with mental illness get the same insurance benefits for
treating depression as they do for treating physical ailments like
asthma, and announced that the federal government would now make
sure that employees are covered for mental illness just as they are
for any other malady. On Monday, the government sent a letter to
285 participating health plans telling them they must comply.
</P>
<P>
   The president also announced that 1,000 schools would get free
satellite programming on dealing with students prone to violence,
and announced several other programs for mentally ill homeless
people, elderly people and young Native American people.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been too long since we've come together over something
this real that touches so many of us,'' he said, and praised the
Gores by saying that while most politicians talk about family
values, ``no couple in public life has ever done remotely as much
to try and figure out how to help families.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gore is the president's mental health adviser, and bounded
upon the stage as if pumped as for a political rally, giving the
thumbs-up and even jumping a little at one point.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting side by side for two hours, the family dynamic between
the Clintons and the Gores, at a time when Al Gore has been
portrayed as competing with Hillary Clinton as campaign season
approaches, ranged from supportive to adoring.
</P>
<P>
   Each nodded attentively at the others' remarks, and Mrs. Gore
introduced Hillary Clinton by saying that when it came to shedding
light on new research about how the brain works, ``no one could do
that any better than the sunshine of all our lives, our first lady,
Hillary Rodham Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton returned the compliment by saying, ``If I had any
voice I'd break into `You Are the Sunshine of My Life,' and
dedicate it to Tipper.''
</P>
<P>
   In her role as moderator, Mrs. Gore choreographed both Clintons
and her husband, at one point telling the vice president, ``You
might want to get up and go over now,'' pointing him toward a
corner where he was to interview two more people about their
experiences with mental illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, ma'am,'' he told her, laughing. ``I'm anxious to follow
instructions carefully, but to depart from my destruct _ or, to
depart from my instructions, I want to say I hope you can see how
proud I am of Tipper.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gore began the program by interviewing Mike Wallace, of
television's ``60 Minutes,'' about his experience with depression,
sitting beside him and repeatedly patting his hand and arm as he
spoke. When, at one point, Wallace tried to break off, saying, ``I
don't want to monopolize this,'' Mrs. Gore urged him to continue,
saying, ``It's important because you're a man and you come forward
and you can help so many men.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in effect on trial for my life, a libel trial,'' Wallace
told the crowd, describing the nightmare of spending weeks in a
courtroom where the case was being heard, and of being grilled by
other journalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, now, we love our friends in the press,'' Mrs. Gore
interjected.
</P>
<P>
   He went on, saying, ``I was lower than a snake's belly,'' and
described how he took to calling his doctor late at night,
wondering what was wrong, only to be told, basically, to buck up.
He was eventually hospitalized, and after winning the libel case,
relapsed because he went off his medicine. Now, on medication ``for
the rest of my life, I feel better up here than ever in my life,''
Wallace said, pointing to his head.
</P>
<P>
   As President and Mrs. Clinton listened intently to the story,
they were mirror images of one another, each holding one finger in
the crook of their chins.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also seemed riveted by the story of a young woman who
had battled anorexia, once limiting herself to only 20 calories a
day, less than half an apple, and doing situps until her back was
covered with sores. ``How much weight did you lose?'' the president
asked her. ``How much did you weigh?''
</P>
<P>
   When it came Gore's turn to interview a mother whose
eighth-grader has bipolar disorder, he sounded a little like a
therapist himself: ``What I hear you saying is that anyone who
talks about how important it is for families to stay together and
be strong ought to also be supportive of families in these
situations.''
</P>
<P>
   He also spoke to a medical director who found that providing
preventive treatment and full mental health benefits saved his
company money, and again spoke about how his wife had helped
educate him on mental health issues over the years.
</P>
<P>
   Then Mrs. Clinton led a discussion with researchers and Rep.
Lynn Rivers, D-Mich., who said that drugs to treat her bipolar
disorder had at one time eaten up half of her family's income.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the president spoke, saying he was educated on mental
illness by reading the work of the novelist William Styron, then
adding, ``but it is not enough to be moved.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I sort of feel like an anticlimax at this convention _ and not
for the reasons the political reporters think,'' he said, praising
those who had told their stories.
</P>
<P>
   In the afternoon, the Gores hosted what they called a town
meeting on the theme of ``busting myths'' about mental illness, and
Gore appeared to go off script to discuss a conversation he had had
with a nun at the conference earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another myth,'' Gore said, ``is that if you pray hard enough,
if you get your relationship with God in order, that's going to
handle this. For those of us who are religious, that's the first
thing we turn to, but ... if you needed a heart transplant, you
wouldn't think, `If I just pray harder, it will take the place of a
new heart.' You need to work with God.''

`FREE' SPEECH THAT'S BOUGHT AND PAID FOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Check local listings for time and channel.)  
 By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The bad guys have serious TV journalism surrounded, but there
are still a few die-hards refusing to come out with their hands up.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Moyers, for one. He's less prolific than he used to be
because of heart disease and his recuperation from heart surgery in
1994. But he still has the ambition to look large at what ails his
country.
</P>
<P>
   His latest is ``A Bill Moyers Special: Free Speech for Sale,''
airing Tuesday on PBS, in which he suggests that the most effective
``free'' speech these days is the type bought by the rich.
</P>
<P>
   Moyers' concern is that big money is smothering the American
democratic ideal of vigorously competing arguments.
</P>
<P>
   And the culprits may include NBC, ABC, Fox and CBS, which is to
say General Electric, Disney, News Corp. and, well, CBS.
</P>
<P>
   The special is divided into three segments. First, Moyers looks
at how corporate hog farmers used ``issue advocacy'' advertising to
drive a Republican legislator out of office in North Carolina.
She'd had the gall to question the air and water contamination
caused by animal waste.
</P>
<P>
   The second segment is about the tobacco industry's $40 million
media campaign to defeat legislation last year that would have made
tobacco companies accountable for the health damage caused by
cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, and perhaps most interestingly, Moyers questions the
shortage of network news coverage of the 1996 Telecommunications
Act, which by and large was a lovely piece of legislation for
broadcasters.
</P>
<P>
   The act extended broadcasting licenses, weakened stations'
community responsibilities, allowed group station owners (including
the networks) to expand their reach and gave TV broadcasters use of
the digital spectrum in what critics said amounted to a $70 billion
giveaway of a publicly owned resource.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like a juicy nugget for NBC News' ``Fleecing of America''
feature. It wasn't. Moyers says that in a critical nine-month
period, the network newscasts devoted a total of 19 minutes of
coverage to the act _ mostly about the V-chip provision _ and no
time to the digital spectrum issue.
</P>
<P>
   The point, Moyers says, is that if money talks, big money
shouts. Or, in the case of covering the Telecommunications Act,
whispers inaudibly.
</P>
<P>
   In each of these cases, the presumed danger was that money alone
could settle public issues. Anyone who's not a bunk-mate of
corporate interests had trouble being heard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think (James) Madison put that First Amendment in
there just as a device to protect rich people's ability to dominate
the political process,'' says Burt Neuborne, legal director of the
Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of
Law.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers could use a broader context. For example, tobacco money
doesn't necessarily carry the day; last year, California's
Proposition 10 and its cigarette tax passed despite a $30 million
campaign against it. And there is the argument, used to help pass
the Telecommunications Act, that TV's explosion of channels, and
voices, has chipped away at the need for tight regulation. The
broadcasting oligopoly is dead.
</P>
<P>
   But Moyers still makes a disturbing case. It has become too
important to be big in order to be loud in American public life.
It's the sort of issue, vital to a healthy democracy, that will
never be squarely addressed on ``Dateline NBC.''
</P>
<P>
   I spent much of last year missing Moyers as the nation was in
the thrall of Monicagate. How would Moyers, the man who made so
much sense of Watergate and Iran-contra, have tackled the peculiar
Clinton crisis?
</P>
<P>
   Moyers, who turned 65 on Saturday, said in a phone interview
that he scratched his head and ruminated along with the rest of us,
and toyed with the idea of a TV special on the Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to; I thought about it,'' he said. ``I just could not
figure out a way to get my mind around it in an original way. ... I
just never could figure a way to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   For television's lesser journalists, it came all too naturally.

 &HT;    Dominik the Dominator: Hasek's journey to the Cup finals
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ If the style appears to resemble some panic-stricken
youth, there's a reason. The arms go here, the legs go there,
sometimes in ways that don't seem anatomically possible. This is
the way he taught himself as a youth in the hamlet of Pardubice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was always the goalie, from first practice when I was five
years old,'' Dominik Hasek said Monday. ``I remember when I was in
my kitchen or on lake, I never wanted to shoot the puck. I would
put my legs down like this, like posts, and I would tell my father
to shoot the puck. I would do the same in soccer. Always, I wanted
to stop the ball or the puck. I never wanted to shoot.''
</P>
<P>
   Hasek would stand in the doorway of his kitchen, his father
throwing tennis balls at home. Arms went here, legs went there.
Czech home-schooling for goaltenders. Hasek did not become a
stylist. He became Baryshnikov in a blender.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter what he looks like,'' Detroit assistant
coach Dave Lewis said. ``Buffalo has the most dangerous weapon in
hockey. They not only have a great goaltender, they have a guy who
elevates everybody else's level of play. That's when you know you
have somebody special.''
</P>
<P>
   Beginning tonight, Hasek will try to elevate his own career and
Buffalo to previously unforeseen heights when the Sabres meet the
favored Dallas Stars in the opener of the best-of-seven Stanley Cup
finals at Reunion Arena. Hasek has won consecutive Hart Trophies as
the league's most valuable player, as well as the Vezina as its top
goalie, and led his native Czech Republic to a gold medal in the
Winter Olympics last year.
</P>
<P>
   What he and the Sabres never have experienced is a Stanley Cup.
It's not the goal generally embraced by European hockey players,
but Hasek has been in the NHL long enough (nine years) and had
enough ups and downs that he has gained a hunger for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Nagano, we met each other at the airport, went to the
Olympics and in two weeks it was over,'' he said. ``Here, you must
play one month just to get to the Stanley Cup finals. I know how it
feels to win an Olympic medal. I don't know how it feels to win the
Cup. But I know what it means to get here.''
</P>
<P>
   Hasek put himself in position for more post-season honors, going
30-18-14 with a 1.87 goals-against average and .937 saves
percentage. He has been similarly brilliant in the playoffs (11-2,
1.82, .938), carrying a team that entered as a seventh seed to its
first finals in 24 years. But even more miraculous than some of
Hasek's saves is his career evolution. After eight years with his
hometown team, Pardubice, and one with Dukla Jihlava, Hasek came to
U.S. in 1990, signing with Chicago. The Blackhawks did not forecast
greatness. They had drafted him only in the 10th round (199th
overall) in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   For two years, Hasek split time between the Blackhawks and the
minor leagues. Then Chicago coach Mike Keenan didn't think much of
him and, truth is, didn't need him. The Hawks' starter was Eddie
Belfour, the same Belfour whom Hasek will oppose this series.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Chicago dealt Hasek to Buffalo for one Stephane
Beauregard (who has played for six minor-league teams since). Hasek
was not immediately spectacular (11-10-4, 3.15) and was left
unprotected in the 1993 expansion draft.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Anaheim nor Florida took him.
</P>
<P>
   Months later, everybody but the Sabres began to feel ill. Hasek
posted a 1.95 goals-against average in 1993-94, winning his first
of four Vezinas. The only player who almost stopped Hasek's ascent
was himself. In the 1997 playoffs, a sprained knee forced him to
miss seven games. But some doubted the injury, especially when
Hasek skated off the ice during Game 3 against Ottawa, went to the
locker room and didn't return even though he had not been required
to make a save that might've aggravated the injury.
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres went on to win the series in seven games but were
waxed by Philadelphia in the next round. Soon after, coach Ted
Nolan popular with most of his players but not with Hasek was
fired. Hasek, who also had been suspended for three playoffs games
and fined $10,000 for grabbing a newspaper reporter took the heat.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, when Hasek took the ice in Buffalo, he was booed. The
franchise centerpiece and league MVP, booed. But at midseason, he
stoned the world in Nagano, even blanking Canada in a shoot-out,
and all seemed to be forgiven. As he said, ``All of a sudden, I was
the goalie who won the gold medal for the Czech Republic in
people's eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, he is recognized simply as the best. In the playoff opener
against Ottawa, the Sabres were outshot 41-15, but won 2-1. They
have supported their goalie better since. An aggravated groin
injury forced Hasek to miss the first two games of the Eastern
Conference finals. But criticism and doubts about Hasek's desire
was minimal this time.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo coach Lindy Ruff likened Hasek's play to ``the way
Jaromir Jagr is playing now, the way Wayne Gretkzy was in his
prime. They're guys who can dominate, win a game, turn a series.
That's Dom.''
</P>
<P>
   If he keeps winning, Buffalo will be sipping Dom.

 &HT;    AirTran seeking more landing slots
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ AirTran is calling on the government to redistribute
landing ``slots'' at a few key airports, arguing that their control
by major carriers blocks the growth of low-fare competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless some immediate action is taken to allow new entrant
access at the high-density and hub airports, new entrants will be
forced out of entire sections of the country,'' AirTran said in a
letter to the U.S. Department of Transportation.
</P>
<P>
   The discount airline, Atlanta's second-largest carrier,
specifically wants the DOT to open slots for it at Washington's
Reagan National Airport, for service from its Atlanta hub.
</P>
<P>
   AirTran also wants more slots at New York's LaGuardia Airport,
where the DOT previously granted the carrier special landing
rights, so it can bolster its current schedule from Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``If AirTran is going to continue to serve communities
throughout the East Coast and Midwest, it is essential that we be
immediately provided'' with the requested slots, the airline said.
</P>
<P>
   Slots are used at those two airports, along with Chicago's
O'Hare and a handful of others, to control congestion by limiting
flights to a certain number. Atlanta's Hartsfield International is
not slot-controlled.
</P>
<P>
   AirTran argued that major carriers have locked up slots, which
are awarded by the Federal Aviation Administration to specific
airlines. The airlines do not have to surrender them unless they go
unused.
</P>
<P>
   ``The large carriers and their partners control 97 percent of
all domestic jet slots at high-density airports and virtually all
commuter slots at these critical airports,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   AirTran also accuses major airlines of ``hiding'' slots by
having commuter partners use them if the parent carrier doesn't
have a need for them.
</P>
<P>
   AirTran President Robert Fornaro said fares from Atlanta to
Washington-Dulles Airport, which has no slot controls, are about 45
percent lower than to Reagan National. That disparity will remain
until slots to Reagan National are made available to smaller
carriers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The letter marks AirTran's second appeal for government help in
the past two weeks. On May 25, it asked the DOT and Justice
Department to investigate its allegations of predatory pricing by
Atlanta rival Delta Air Lines _ an accusation Delta strongly
denies.
</P>
<P>
   Delta had no immediate comment on the latest letter. A spokesman
for the trade group Air Transport Association also had no comment,
saying members' views on slot issues vary widely.

 &HT;    Miami firm plans 33-story condo project in Atlanta
 &HT;    By Susan Harte
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Crescent Heights, a Miami-based real estate concern,
will break ground in August on a $40 million, 33-story condominium
in Midtown Atlanta. This is the first local ground-up construction
project for the company, which has completed several apartment
conversions in the Atlanta area.
</P>
<P>
   The Mayfair Renaissance, with 300 units, will occupy one acre on
the south side of 14th Street between the Mayfair Royal office
building and the Mayfair, a high-rise apartment that Crescent
Heights is converting to privately owned units.
</P>
<P>
   Ian Eisenberg, marketing director for the new condominium, said
plans are so preliminary that floor configurations have not been
settled. Neither has the target market but, unlike smaller units in
the Mayfair, the Renaissance will be expensive. Prices will start
in the $200,000s and units will be larger, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sales will probably begin in July, after units in the Mayfair
Renaissance have been sized and priced.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ridiculed only a year ago as an overpriced sky box
``bunker'' built to shield Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and his top aides
from physical and perhaps verbal abuse, the city's $13 million
emergency crisis center officially opened Monday with a blaze of
activity simulating a biological attack on New York.
</P>
<P>
   In a cavernous room with giant overhead television monitors and
digitized aerial photos of the city's entire subway, sewage and
water main systems, city officials stared at their computer
monitors and huddled in small groups, exchanging information and
sorting out rumor from fact about the hypothetical epidemic that
had gripped New York.
</P>
<P>
   The complex, which takes up 50,000 square feet on the 23rd floor
of one of the smaller buildings in the World Trade Center in lower
Manhattan, has been mocked by some City Council members and critics
of the Giuliani administration as just one more manifestation of
the mayor's preoccupation with order, and, perhaps, siege
mentality. But the complex won high praise from many of the federal
and state officials taking part in a drill to test the city's
response to a terrorist emergency.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really state of the art _ the best I've seen,'' said
Col. Robert Fitton, chief of the Pentagon unit that provides
military support to civilian authorities in the event of
emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   Partly to counter past criticism, Jerome Hauer, the city's chief
emergency manager, escorted a small group of reporters through the
center on Monday, showing off its newly installed computers and
information systems. ``This,'' Hauer declared, ``is not a bunker.''
</P>
<P>
   Bulletproof, the center features some of the most advanced
computer and telecommunications equipment available and is hardened
to withstand bombs, hurricanes, power failures and other crises. It
was completed on time and under its $16 million budget, with its
cost less than half that of a center being built in Hawaii and less
than a third that of a crisis center in earthquake-prone Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The New York command center is intended to coordinate the city's
response to emergencies ranging from blackouts and severe storms to
terrorist attacks involving conventional and unconventional
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Built to withstand winds of more than 160 mph, the center has
three generators to ensure continuous power in the event of a
blackout, 11,000 gallons of stored drinkable water for emergency
management workers, a 6,000-gallon ceiling-mounted fuel tank that
guarantees 72 hours of operation, and a secure communications
system. It can accommodate up to 94 people monitoring a citywide
emergency.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, the city unveiled the center as it was staging a
drill with federal and state officials for a biological attack.
Several federal officials said they were impressed.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis center still has its critics. Councilwoman Kathryn
Freed, whose district houses the new center, reiterated concerns
about the prudence of the investment, given the city's vast needs.
She also challenged its location in a building not owned by the
city _ and charges $1.4 million a year in rent a year under its
20-year lease.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an incredible amount of money to enhance somebody else's
property,'' Ms. Freed said. ``We had a state-of-the-art emergency
center in police headquarters, and I still don't understand why we
needed this one.''
</P>
<P>
   Some police officials apparently share her skepticism,
particularly since the Police Department already has it own command
and control center at its headquarters in lower Manhattan.
Emergency management officials noted that the department resented
the Office of Emergency Management's growing role in crisis
management and said police concerns almost scuttled the project at
one point.
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Mode, a police spokeswoman, said the department would
maintain its own command center. Asked whether the police resented
giving up command of the city during certain crises, she replied:
``We not giving up anything. We have our own crisis center.''
</P>
<P>
   But a 1994 memo from the commanding officer of the police
operations division questioned the ability of police headquarters
to withstand an emergency. In the event of an earthquake,
hurricane, terrorist act or other crisis, the memo stated, ``One
Police Plaza would likely be unable to sustain operations due [to)
loss of power, water, communications or structural integrity.''
This, in turn, could have a ``devastating impact on our ability to
restore order.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the center's location in the World Trade Center, in
a building across the street from the site of the 1992 terrorist
bombing that killed six people, Hauer said that the site was chosen
after a study of some 50 locations. The complex now has tight
security and is close to the mayor's office, police and fire
departments, and headquarters of other key city officials, he said,
adding that in the event of an emergency, emergency personnel would
want to reach the center on foot.
</P>
<P>
   The command center occupies about half the space of the complex.
</P>
<P>
   Engineers had urged that the center not be built in a basement
or converted bomb shelter _ as Los Angeles has done _ because of
Manhattan's city's 100-year-old water mains. An earthquake or
bombing risked turning an underground facility into ``a $13 million
swimming pool,'' Hauer said.
</P>
<P>
   One of several elevators to the 23rd floor, he added, has its
own power supply to assure continued access during a blackout. He
called security at the facility excellent, as no truck is permitted
to enter the building complex without being searched. The 47-story
building, 7 World Trade Center, also rents space on the ninth and
10th floors to the Secret Service, another government agency that
values security.

CLINTON WILL PROPOSE DRUG COVERAGE FOR MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES 
</HEADLINE>

 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton will soon propose revamping the
Medicare program to offer prescription drug coverage to all
beneficiaries, and he will contend that such coverage can actually
save money for the government by reducing the need for hospital
stays and nursing home care, administration officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said the drug coverage could be offered for an
extra premium as low as $10 a month and, in any event, less than
$25, they said.
</P>
<P>
   The president intends to unveil his plan later this month as an
alternative to one proposed in March by a 17-member advisory
commission. His proposal will boost efforts by Democratic lawmakers
to cover prescription drugs, a change long sought by older
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said that Clinton would not try to impose
federal controls on drug prices. Rather, they said, under his
proposal, the government would hire private companies to help buy
drugs and manage the new drug benefit. Such ``pharmacy benefit
managers'' could control costs by obtaining discounts from drug
manufacturers and drug stores, and by preventing overuse or misuse
of prescription drugs, the administration contends.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would never do price controls,'' said a senior White House
official.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed drug benefit is the centerpiece of Clinton's plan
to modernize Medicare and shore up the finances of the program for
39 million people who are elderly or disabled. The Medicare trust
fund is expected to run out of money in 2015, assuming no changes
in current law.
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats say they will include prescription drug benefits
as a major plank of their political platform next year. They look
forward to a fight over the issue with Republicans, who are also
eager to provide drug benefits but fear that the cost of such
coverage could explode.
</P>
<P>
   John D. Podesta, the White House chief of staff, who has taken
charge of efforts to draft the president's Medicare proposal, said
the drug benefit would be ``universal and affordable,'' would have
``a modest premium'' and would be ``better than anything you could
buy today in the open market.''
</P>
<P>
   Medicare beneficiaries now pay a monthly premium of $45.50 for
coverage that does not include drugs. Administration officials said
the extra premium for drug coverage would be far less than what
many elderly people now pay for such coverage under private
insurance to fill the gaps in Medicare. Drug coverage under such
Medigap policies often exceeds $80 a month, the White House says.
</P>
<P>
   The president's plan is an alternative to the one devised by the
co-chairmen of the 17-member commission, Sen. John B. Breaux,
Democrat of Louisiana, and Rep. Bill Thomas, Republican of
California. Under the Breaux-Thomas plan, the government would
offer a fixed amount of money to each beneficiary to purchase a
public or private health plan.
</P>
<P>
   Just hours before the panel finished work in March, Clinton said
its final proposal ``does not provide for an adequate, affordable
prescription drug benefit'' and could cause excessive increases in
premiums for people in the traditional Medicare program.
</P>
<P>
   Confidential White House documents, outlining Clinton's
proposal, assert that drug coverage can save money for Medicare, by
reducing admissions to hospitals and nursing homes, and the need
for home health care as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``A $1 increase in pharmaceutical expenditure is associated with
a $3.65 reduction in hospital care expenditure,'' one document
says. Moreover, it says, effective treatment for Alzheimer's
disease, including drugs like tacrine, ``could keep 10 percent of
patients out of nursing homes, thus saving billions of dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard S. Foster, chief actuary of the Medicare program, is
trying to estimate the cost of various options being considered by
the president. White House officials said they had sent Foster many
studies to support their contention that the proper use of drugs
could save money elsewhere in Medicare. But one official said it
was difficult to persuade Foster, because he was ``very, very
conservative'' in his estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Democratic members of Congress said Clinton had not
shared details of his proposal with them. ``We haven't heard
anything,'' said Rep. Pete Stark of California, the ranking
Democrat on the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health.
</P>
<P>
   Stark said he feared that the administration would cut a deal
with Republican leaders of the House and the Senate late this year,
and that the resulting bill would be ``dumped on our doorstep 48
hours before we have to vote on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said Clinton's plan would also include
these elements:
</P>
<P>
   _ The government would encourage price competition among health
maintenance organizations, by requiring them to bid for the right
to enroll Medicare beneficiaries. HMOs strenuously oppose this
idea, because the original fee-for-service Medicare program would
not be included in the competition.
</P>
<P>
   _ At least 15 percent of the expected federal budget surplus
would be pumped into Medicare, to improve the program's financial
condition and perhaps to help pay for drug benefits.
</P>
<P>
   _ Federal officials would have broad new authority to sign
contracts with selected suppliers of goods and services who offer
the best price to Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   _ Employers who now offer drug benefits to retirees would be
allowed to buy drug coverage from Medicare, presumably at a lower
price than they now pay.

</P>
<P>
   Walter K. Moore, a vice president of Genentech, a biotechnology
company based in South San Francisco, said today, ``We're
encouraged when we hear that the president's plan won't include
explicit price controls.''
</P>
<P>
   Pharmacy benefit managers and HMOs typically establish lists of
preferred drugs, known as formularies, and recommend low-cost
generic versions of brand-name drugs. Sometimes they also require
doctors to get approval before prescribing certain drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Moore said such restrictions were ``not cause for concern'' at
Genentech because the company had been able to prove the value of
its drugs to HMOs and pharmacy benefit managers.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Moore said, Activase, a clot-dissolving drug made
by Genentech, is used in the treatment of heart attack and stroke.
``At $2,200 a dose,'' he said, ``it's expensive therapy. But it can
save tens of thousands of dollars in overall costs. Patients don't
need to stay in the hospital as long, and they don't need as much
rehabilitation.''
</P>
<P>
   Prescription drugs were among the benefits that would have been
guaranteed to all Americans under President Clinton's ill-fated
plan for universal health insurance coverage in 1993-94. Under that
plan, the government would have set payment limits for many drugs
and would have required drug makers to provide discounts, in the
form of rebates to the government. Drug companies mobilized a small
army of lobbyists against those ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, many Medicare beneficiaries have obtained coverage
for prescription drugs by purchasing private insurance or by
staying in health plans run by their former employers. But the
White House contends that such coverage is eroding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fewer employers are offering retiree health coverage, and
Medigap is increasingly scarce and expensive,'' the White House
says in a document defending its new proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only 23 percent of Medicare beneficiaries are expected to have
private employer-based or Medigap insurance for drug coverage in
2000, according to the Medicare actuary _ down significantly from
1995,'' the White House says. The actuaries estimate that, by 2000,
only 17 percent of beneficiaries will have drug coverage from
former employers, while 6 percent will have Medigap policies
covering drug costs.
</P>
<P>
   More than six million Medicare beneficiaries are in HMOs, and
most have some type of drug coverage. But the White House says
these benefits ``are likely to be reduced or dropped in the
future,'' as health plans cope with budget cuts made by Congress in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Breaux's commission would have guaranteed drug coverage
for low-income beneficiaries. But the White House rejects that
approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beneficiaries across the income spectrum lack drug coverage,''
says a White House document explaining the president's plan.
``About 16 million beneficiaries are projected to have no drug
coverage in 2000. Lack of drug coverage is not just a problem for
low-income beneficiaries; 40 percent of beneficiaries without drug
coverage have income above 200 percent of poverty (about $17,000
for a single person, $23,000 for a couple in 2000).''

MILK AS A FOOD REQUIREMENT IS QUESTIONED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DOLORES KONG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For generations, mothers have told children ``drink your milk''
and recently celebrities sporting milk mustaches have offered
similar advice in glossy ads, making the beverage seem as American
as, well, motherhood and apple pie.
</P>
<P>
   But now milk is at the center of a major food fight.
</P>
<P>
   As the federal government prepares for the first time in five
years to revise US dietary guidelines, which could affect what
Americans eat and what gets served to schoolchildren and the
elderly through government food programs, it is coming under
increasing pressure to downgrade milk as a requirement.
</P>
<P>
   A separate but just as feisty debate over milk is being waged
over the health claims made in the dairy industry's well-known
milk-mustache ads featuring celebrities endorsing the beverage for
its health benefits.
</P>
<P>
   How milk became the center of this controversy is a story of
politics, money, and race. On one side are some physicians and
health experts who see a cultural bias in the promotion of milk
because many non-whites are lactose intolerant and have trouble
digesting milk. They are up against the powerful interests of the
dairy industry and government officials who are determined to keep
milk near the top of the US Department of Agriculture's food
pyramid. The dietary guidelines now being revised serve as the
basis for the pyramid.
</P>
<P>
   Calcium and dairy products are just some of the issues before a
special advisory committee that is helping to revise the US dietary
guidelines. Some industry groups want the committee, which will
meet later this month, to give its blessing to alcohol, citing
studies showing a health benefit from moderate alcohol consumption,
and other health groups want the guidelines to more strongly
emphasize a plant-based diet.
</P>
<P>
   While the government's periodic revision of dietary guidelines
has come under fire before, the arguments over milk have been among
the most contentious, with both sides lining up their celebrity
endorsements.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a major campaign being planned to try to get adults
to drink three glasses of milk every day. That's what the milk
mustache campaign wants to do,'' said Dr. Walter C. Willett,
professor and chairman of the department of nutrition at the
Harvard School of Public Health, which has completed a study
showing no evidence to support claims that milk and other
calcium-rich foods significantly reduce osteoporosis-related bone
fractures. ``If we do that, we'll increase saturated fat
consumption in adults. That inevitably will increase heart attack
rates.''
</P>
<P>
   Willett and other health professionals argue that dairy products
should be listed as just one source of calcium and should not be
featured on the food pyramid as a separate category, the ``milk,
yogurt and cheese group,'' from which two to three servings a day
should be chosen.
</P>
<P>
   But dairy and government officials, as well as some physicians,
contend that milk and other dairy products still offer one of the
best ways for Americans to get the calcium needed for healthy
bones, and should remain a key component of the US diet. They note
that low-fat milk and milk products with reduced lactose (milk
sugar) are available. Studies showing the importance of dairy
products for bone health are cited.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue really is that there is a calcium crisis in this
country,'' said Susan Ruland, a spokeswoman for the National Fluid
Milk Processors Promotion Board, a group created by the US
Department of Agriculture and financed by the dairy industry. It
spends $80 million a year on the milk-mustache ads. ``Dairy
products provide the most economical, most widely available and
easiest sources of daily calcium by far.''
</P>
<P>
   Eileen Kennedy, USDA deputy undersecretary for research,
education and economics, acknowledged the higher rate of lactose
intolerance among minorities and whites whose ancestors came from
the Mediterranean, but defended the food pyramid. It can only
``communicate to the majority of Americans. It doesn't communicate
to all Americans,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The American Academy of Pediatrics has no official position on
the current controversy, according to a review of its on-line
policy statements, although it strongly supports breastfeeding in
the first year of a baby's life and has supported a federal effort
to ensure that that children and adolescents get enough calcium.
</P>
<P>
   The group spearheading the make-milk-optional movement, the
Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, has gotten letters
of support from Muhammad Ali, Alice Walker, US Representative Jesse
L. Jackson Jr. and former Surgeon General M. Joycelyn Elders, as
well as from groups like the NAACP, the Association of Asian
Pacific Community Health Organizations and the National Hispanic
Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   The letters cite the higher proportion of minorities who are
lactose intolerant: about 90 percent of Asians, 70 percent of
blacks and Native Americans, and 50 percent of Hispanics, according
to a review of the literature by the Physicians Committee. It says
about 15 percent of all whites are lactose intolerant.
</P>
<P>
   Most children of all races have the enzyme to digest milk, but
many minority children lose that ability by their teens or early
adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   The letters also support the committee's recommendation that the
dietary guidelines encourage a plant-based diet to reduce such
chronic conditions as heart disease and diabetes, since they
disproportionately affect minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is the biggest problem we have right now? We are being
bankrupted by our ill health,'' said Dr. Neal D. Barnard, president
of the Physicians Committee. The commitee, a private, nonprofit
group based in Washington, D.C., advocates for disease prevention
and favors a more plant-based diet. ``If we have dietary guidelines
that promote ill health, which disproportionately affect
minorities, it should be our priority to change that.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of a change in the guidelines and food pyramid point
to dark, leafy green vegetables such as bok choy and collard
greens, and fortified juice, as excellent sources of calcium. And
they cite other nations whose diets are low in dairy and meat yet
whose rates of osteoporosis fractures are lower than in the United
States. They acknowledge, though, that other factors, such as
exercise levels, may play a role.
</P>
<P>
   At the Physicians Committee's request, the Congressional Black
Caucus last Friday sent a letter to President Clinton, calling for
more racially sensitive dietary guidelines. Clinton has led a
campaign recently to reduce racial disparities in health
statistics.
</P>
<P>
   The committee filed a complaint in April with the Federal Trade
Commission over some of the dairy industry's celebrity-studded milk
ads, alleging they violate federal guidelines for health claims.
</P>
<P>
   The dairy industry's Ruland defended the ads, saying they have
been reviewed by the USDA and lawyers specializing in FTC matters.
She said the Physicians Committee has a hidden purpose. ``They will
purport to be speaking out in the interests of nutrition, when in
fact, they have an animal activist agenda. That's quite
irresponsible for public health.'' The committee is ``anti-meat,
anti-dairy,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Milton Mills, a member of the Physicians Committee, says his
group is not trying to impose a vegetarian agenda on the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very clearly, a number of persons of color are out there
suffering needlessly, spending all sorts of money on medication
they don't need,'' said Mills, who is black and lactose intolerant.
He said he has diagnosed lactose intolerance in many of his
minority patients who thought they had irritable bowel syndrome,
spastic colon, or some other chronic lower abdominal disorder.

   JAZINCE, Macedonia _ One shell exploded in a family's living
room, blasting a hole through the ceiling, embedding shrapnel in
the carpet and freezing the decorative clock hanging from the wall
at 2:58 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Another shell blew out the windows at an elementary school. And
a third landed near a parked car, sending shrapnel through the
passenger's door and window.
</P>
<P>
   Emine Mustafi, 24, sleeping in the next room when the shell
exploded in the living room, said the unprovoked attack terrified
her. Fear of further shelling prompted village leaders to remove
all women and children.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mustafe, still shaken, eagerly supported that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard so much shelling I thought all the village was
burning,'' she said. ``I don't know how we escaped.''
</P>
<P>
   The shells were part of what Macedonian officials said was a
volley of more than 30 fired into this border village on Sunday
night by Yugoslav forces from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The attack was the most serious violence along the border since
NATO began bombing Yugoslavia in March.
</P>
<P>
   What motivated the attack, which was just after the talks
between NATO and Yugoslav generals had failed, was not clear. The
shelling might be a Serbian push to inflict as much damage and
create as much instability as possible inside and outside Kosovo
before Serbian forces withdraw.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav forces have repeatedly pursued rebels of the Kosovo
Liberation Army into Albania, and the shelling might have been an
attempt to intimidate them.
</P>
<P>
   Western and Macedonian officials said the rebels regularly
transported weapons and munitions from Macedonia to Kosovo. But the
rebels are careful to use the area only to transport supplies and
do not attack Serbian forces from Macedonia, as they have in
northern Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Macedonian officials filed a formal protest with Yugoslavia on
Monday about the shelling, as well as the firing of more than 24
shells into two other border villages, Tanysevci and Malino, 30
miles east, early Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what the motives are for the shelling,'' Defense
Minister Nikola Kljusev of Macedonia said on Monday at a news
conference. ``It's not good that these things are happening at the
time when negotiations for peace are going on.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials have asked the rebel guerrillas to refrain from
starting military actions from Macedonia, fearing that it could
destabilize the country, Western diplomats said. But NATO and the
Kosovar group deny that they are in contact or coordinate
activities.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Refugees who arrived here last week said that rebel fighters had
recently retaken three Albanian villages around Kacanik in
southeastern Kosovo that had fallen to Serbian forces just before
the bombing began. Those accounts could not be verified.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees, Paula Ghedini, said some of the few hundred refugees who
had trickled into Macedonia recently, mostly over mountain passes,
had reported that Serbs were destroying buildings in Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   But two Albanians living in Pristina contacted by telephone
reported no new destruction. They did say Serbian civilians were
looting more Albanian houses and businesses and shipping the goods
to Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   The differing explanations for the border attacks were
illustrated by a group of 261 men and four women who walked over a
mountain pass near Jazince into Macedonia on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   One of the exhausted and sunburned refugees, Ramadan
Niftarkolgeci, 42, said most of the group had endured a six-day
journey through the forest and over the mountains. The men were
separated from their wives and children by Serbian forces a month
ago but only managed to escape now, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But a Macedonian police official said the Macedonians believed
that the men were Kosovo Liberation Army fighters. When the men
were found crossing the border, a handful were armed or wearing
uniforms, the police said. Because the group surrendered
peacefully, no charges were brought, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   The civilians of Jazince called for retaliatory bombing against
the Serbs and a greater NATO presence. On Monday afternoon, a grim
procession of men walked their wives and children out of the
picturesque village of 1,300. Among them were some of 300 refugees
from Kosovo who had been taken in by residents after having fled to
Macedonia. A refugee who is six months pregnant, Fikrije Burnike,
27, said she endured a 24-hour hike from Kosovo with her husband
and two children three weeks ago. But now it has found her here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I escaped from there and now I have to escape from here,''
Mrs. Burnike said as she walked out of Jazince. ``Nowhere are you
safe.''

 WASHINGTON: as amendments.   
<TEXT>
<P>
   That would help them avoid oratorical fireworks in the Judiciary
Committee, whose Republican members do not necessarily reflect the
majority in their party and whose Democratic members have a
penchant for sniping.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were the speaker,'' said Rep. Robert Wexler, D-Fla., a
member of the committee, ``and I was trying to find a bigger tent,
the last thing I'd want to focus on is the Republicans in the
Judiciary Committee, in all their zeal, voting down gun control.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican aides noted that taking gun-control measures directly
to the floor would also allow Republicans to cast votes on
individual measures _ some more acceptable to them than others _
rather than on a package predetermined by the Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., the chairman of the Judiciary
Committee, favors many new restrictions on firearms and has said
that he would put versions of the gun-control proposals that passed
the Senate into the juvenile crime bill.
</P>
<P>
   But Republican aides on the committee said that the House
gun-show measure would most likely contain softer language than the
Senate's.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats expressed fears that their leaders were getting
cold feet and ignoring appeals from the Clinton administration that
the House go further than the Senate, for example by adopting
measures to raise the age for handgun possession to 21 from 18.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. James Moran, D-Va., said that Democratic leaders were
haunted by the conviction that Democrats lost control of the House
in 1994 in large part because they had pushed gun control and
incurred the wrath of the NRA.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are so close to getting back the majority,'' Moran noted,
``and they're afraid.''
</P>
<P>
   Laura Nichols, a spokeswoman for Rep. Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., the
minority leader, said Democratic leaders in the House simply felt
that they did not have enough votes to add measures to the Senate
gun-control package.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an ideal world,'' Ms. Nichols said, ``we'd like to do
more.''
</P>
<P>
   The situation is complicated by the growing intensity of the
rifle association's efforts. In its recent letter to supporters
about events in Washington, NRA officials wrote, ``The air in this
town is so thick with deceit and dishonesty about this gun scheme,
only you can offset it with your action.''
</P>
<P>
   The scheme they were referring to was the gun-show measure
passed by the Senate, which was dissected and disparaged in three
pages of text and an accompanying fact sheet.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Ricker, executive director of the American Shooting
Sports Council, a trade group with a more conciliatory tone toward
gun control, said Monday that the NRA was trying to shut his group
down and ``silence us because we are not spouting the party line.''
</P>
<P>
   NRA officials said that was not true.

 &HT;    With Klesko out sick, slumping Williams back
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Braves keep trying to hand Gerald Williams a job.
He keeps handing it back.
</P>
<P>
   Williams took an 0-for-23 slump into Monday's game, back in the
starting lineup in left field while Ryan Klesko remained at home
with the flu. Just one year after hitting a career-high .305 in his
first Atlanta season, his average has dipped to .195.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think it was that low,'' manager Bobby Cox said. ``I
tell you I never look at a lot of those things. I get surprised all
the time when I look up and a guy is hitting .300 and then he's
sitting over there on the bench hitting .150. But for me, he's
doing a lot better than his average indicates.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams was hitting a solid .289 until he replaced Otis Nixon
as a full-time left fielder in mid-May and the resultant drop-off
has been dramatic. He wound up hitting just .194 for the month, and
though Cox would not make a formal commitment, Klesko's move from
first base back to left could last the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was kind of auditioning for playing every day and he hasn't
been selective,'' hitting coach Don Baylor said. ``He hasn't been
in a hitter's count in a while. When he's 2-0, 3-1, he's going to
get a fastball.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's always 0-2 or 1-2 and he has to chase the split in the
dirt or the slider in the dirt.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams thrived while platooning last year, driving in a
career-high 46 runs and matching his career high in homers (10) in
just 266 at-bats. And he killed left-handed pitching with a .336
average.
</P>
<P>
   This season, he is managing just .230 versus LHP. His power has
disappeared. His ninth-inning homer May 20 that forced extra
innings against Chicago is his only home run in a 26-game period.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would would have to think,'' Williams said, ``that sooner
or later, things would turn around to a positive end for me.
Right?''
</P>
<P>
   Sick call
</P>
<P>
   The Braves were without Klesko, after he came down with flu-like
symptoms (nausea and high-fever) Monday morning. He remained at his
Covington home, and his availability for tonight is uncertain.
Chipper Jones was also suffering body aches with a fever and was
only cleared to play by team physician David Watson 30 minutes
before gametime.
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop Walt Weiss missed his eighth game in 12 days with
soreness in his right thigh.
</P>
<P>
   Etc.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves' team batting average, which stood at .275 on May 3
when they were second in the league, has plummeted nearly 20
points. Atlanta entered play Monday hitting .257, 15th in the
league. . . . Jose Canseco played his first game in the field for
the Devil Rays, starting in left field. He played 47 games in the
outfield last season with Toronto, but all of them before July 29.
. . . One of the Braves team buses was involved in a rear-end
collision Sunday evening while the team was en route to Boston's
Logan Airport from Fenway Park. There were no serious injuries
reported, though the entire traveling party squeezed into the
second bus and continued to the airport with some standing in the
aisle.

<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ For five years they have lived, four
adults in a single room, in this drab compound of makeshift huts on
the outskirts of Belgrade. The Sehovac family, Serbs who fled
Sarajevo in 1994, are sunk in a world of depression and bitterness.
</P>
<P>
   Goran Sehovac, 21, is in a wheelchair, paralyzed from the chest
down since a bullet shattered his spine when he was 16. He is a
hulking man now, spilling out of his battered wheelchair, but his
muscles are flabby. His father, Kosta Sehovac, bare-chested in the
heat of a Sunday afternoon, slumps by the table, a sullen anger in
his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our misery as refugees,'' he says, gesturing around
the cramped room lined with bunk beds. There is a table, a chair, a
refrigerator and a television set. In Sarajevo, they had an
apartment, a house and a car. Even the garage had central heating,
Sehovac said. ``We lived well before the war,'' he said. ``Now
there is no way back.''
</P>
<P>
   At least they have a bathroom of their own. Others in the
compound, invalids among them, have to share three toilets among 20
families.
</P>
<P>
   Nevenka Sehovac, Kosta's wife and Goran's mother, is the
family's only breadwinner. She works in the central market in
Belgrade, where she sells cheap T-shirts and shorts. She has a soft
face and tearful eyes, but her jaw is set hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't get any better. Every day is more difficult,'' she
says, standing by her stall. ``I can buy food with my earnings, but
milk is almost a luxury.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sehovac family is part of a huge dispossessed community in
Serbia. There are half a million Serb refugees from the wars in
Croatia and Bosnia, and 177,000 in Belgrade alone, according to the
U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Sergio Vieira de Mello, the U.N. undersecretary general and the
emergency relief coordinator, who met with some of the refugees
during a recent visit to Serbia, described their living conditions
as ``subhuman.''
</P>
<P>
   They have been joined by 11,500 refugees from Kosovo, most of
them Roma, or gypsies, and ethnic Serbs, who have fled Kosovo over
the two months of NATO bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The refugees live all over the country in disused army barracks,
workers' camps, holiday homes and hotels. They are stateless, with
no citizenship, no valid passports, no vote and few rights. If they
work, they do so illegally, ``on the black,'' as they call it.
</P>
<P>
   Kosta Sehovac is unemployed, his wife explained. ``There are no
jobs for the people here, let alone for refugees.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav government, enduring a failing economy hit by years
of war and sanctions, helps the refugees by providing some free
food, but little else.
</P>
<P>
   And now government officials and local aid organizations are
bracing for a new wave of refugees: Serbs from Kosovo. Many are
expected to flee as NATO takes control and Albanians return to
their homes.
</P>
<P>
   If Albanians come back in large numbers, NATO forces may be
unable to control revenge killings, aid officials warn. That in
turn could precipitate a wave of new refugees, on a scale similar
to the exodus of Serbs from Krajina in 1995. Then 170,000 Serbs
fled their homes in two days. Many of them arrived in Belgrade in
tractors and horse-drawn carts and today still occupy most of the
public buildings.
</P>
<P>
   At Krnjaca, there are already two families of refugees from
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Mirko Mrdalj is a refugee twice over. He fled with his wife and
tiny daughter from Krajina, a part of Croatia where Serbs were
living, in 1995. They were given a room in a disused military
barracks in Urosevac in Kosovo where they lived for four years.
Then when NATO began bombing, they fled once again, with few
belongings, and came to Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Now he has left Kosovo because his 6-year-old daughter needs
hospital treatment. His own expectations were zero. ``There is no
future here,'' he said looking around at refugees sitting slumped
outside their rooms in the afternoon sun. ``They are more or less
all unemployed and without money.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Kosovo is also without prospects,'' he said. ``No one knows
which is better.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Kosta Sehovac has no doubts in his mind. Unemployed for five
years, sitting at home looking after his disabled son while his
wife works every day in the market, he does not try to hide his
frustration. He says he fought for two months near his home village
before his son was wounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was two months in the trenches; we were like cattle, and for
what?'' he said. ``I feel so sorry for the Serb people who are
still down there'' in Kosovo. ``But maybe it is better to stay
there and get killed. I think it would have been better for me to
stay behind and get killed.''
</P>
<P>
   His words hang in the room. His younger son walks out of the
room and goes outdoors without a word.
</P>
<P>
   In a room across the compound, Marija Bardak, 41, jokes with her
neighbors, sitting beneath a clothesline.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bardak, mother of three, says she is finally leaving after
six years in Krnjaca and going home to Republika Srpska where she
has managed to reclaim her apartment.
</P>
<P>
   She had no advice for the Serbs in Kosovo, she said. ``My wish
was never to leave my house. People do not understand what it is,
to have to leave your home. It is like someone cuts off your legs,
it is like losing some part of you,'' she said. ``But when you have
children, you have to leave.''

DISNEY MAY BUY INFOSEEK, INVEST IN NEW FIRM TO BACK WEB COMPANIES
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURBANK, Calif. _ The Walt Disney Co. announced Monday a major
push to bulk up its Internet presence, disclosing it may buy all of
portal partner Infoseek and invest in a new firm to back Web
start-up companies.
</P>
<P>
   Burbank-based Disney also announced it may create a separate
stock to track its Internet assets _ a move that Wall Street
investors have been seeking for months. The new stock will enable
the entertainment giant to take advantage of the sizzling market
for Web stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Separating the Internet holdings will highlight them a give
Disney a currency to make future acquisitions,'' said Linda
Bannister, an analyst with Edward Jones. ``Clearly, the Internet
offers Disney a lot of opportunity to distribute the wealth of
content in a new format.''
</P>
<P>
   Disney and Sunnyvale-based Infoseek launched the Go Network
portal site in January to lure customers and advertisers through an
easy-to-find hub for entering the Internet. Analysts have said the
partnership makes sense as a way for Disney to maximize benefits
from its already popular Web sites such as Disney.com, ABCNEWS.com
and ESPN.com.
</P>
<P>
   Disney will likely have to pay a premium for the rest of
Infoseek since its year-old deal, under which it bought 43 percent
for $70 million plus $165 million in promotional support, precludes
Disney boosting its stake until 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Disney made the announcements after the market closed. It did
not disclose the amount of its investment in the new company, which
will be called eCompanies and run by Sky Dayton, founder and
chairman of EarthLink, and Jake Winebaum, who is stepping down as
chairman of Disney's Internet operations.
</P>
<P>
   Pasadena-based EarthLink, which has 1.15 million customers, will
also make an undisclosed investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is only about 20 percent invented,'' Winebaum
said. ``We want eCompanies to play a role in the creation of a
small piece of the remaining 80 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Dayton, who founded EarthLink in 1994, will continue as chairman
of EarthLink while veteran Disney executive Steve Wadsworth will be
promoted to the post of president of Buena Vista Internet Group.

 &HT;    Molder's Open spot eases NCAA sting
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ After the disaster that was Georgia Tech's NCAA
championship experience last week, Bryce Molder almost erased the
pain Monday at East Lake Golf Club.
</P>
<P>
   Almost.
</P>
<P>
   Even securing a spot in the U.S. Open at Pinehurst No. 2 next
week didn't wipe out the torture of finishing 28th among 30 teams
at the NCAA's and watching rival Georgia take the title.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's close, but nothing makes up for the team deal,'' said
Molder, 20, college golf's No. 1-ranked player. ``It just makes me
forget about it for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Molder, who shot rounds of 66-73 (5-under 139) in the 36-hole
qualifier, earned his Pinehurst trip on the first hole of a playoff
for the last two spots, chipping to two feet for a par at East
Lake's 232-yard, par-3 18th. Victimized was Augusta, Ga.'s Charles
Howell of Oklahoma State, who missed a four-footer a moment before
Molder's putt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a huge dream for me,'' said Molder. ``I probably won't
realize how big a deal it is until I get there.
</P>
<P>
   Out of 63 players competing Monday at East Lake, also making the
Open field were a pair of Nike Tour players _ Bob Heintz, 29, of
Palm Harbor, Fla., the medalist at 8-under-par 136 (65-71); and Tim
Loustalot, 34, of Scottsdale, Ariz. (68-70, 136) _ and North
Carolina State's Mark Slawter, 25, of Raleigh, N.C. (71-68, 139),
the 1994 North-South Amateur champion at Pinehurst.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Nelson, 51, the 1983 U.S. Open champion, shot a 4-under
140 (69-71) and finished a shot out of the playoff. Billy Andrade,
an East Lake member and former North-South Amateur champion at
Pinehurst No. 2, slipped to a par 72 after an opening 69 and missed
by two shots.
</P>
<P>
   Irked about having to qualify as a former champion, Nelson
declared that it would be his last attempt. He only tried this year
because of a fondness for Pinehurst, which served as a sectional
qualifying site when he got his PGA Tour card in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the heat and humidity, Nelson, wearing long pants
because he forgot that pros and amateurs were allowed to wear
shorts, almost pulled it off. His second-round 71, however,
included four bogeys and a double-bogey. After a missed, downhill
four-footer for birdie at the par-5 15th, he bogeyed 16 after
catching the lip of a fairway bunker on his second shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played well enough to get in,'' Nelson said. ``Just a few
too many hiccups. I was excited about coming to play, just to prove
to myself that I could still walk 36 holes in one day.''
</P>
<P>
   Medalist Heintz had the most pressing reason to get out of town
after his performance. A Yale man, he hurried back to Florida,
where his wife, Nancy, was going into labor.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I don't seem too excited (about the Open), it's because I'm
pretty dead right now,'' said Heintz. ``I'm having a son in the
morning.''

 WASHINGTON: now pay. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Walter K. Moore, a vice president of Genentech, a biotechnology
company based in South San Francisco, said today, ``We're
encouraged when we hear that the president's plan won't include
explicit price controls.''
</P>
<P>
   Pharmacy benefit managers and HMOs typically establish lists of
preferred drugs, known as formularies, and recommend low-cost
generic versions of brand-name drugs. Sometimes they also require
doctors to get approval before prescribing certain drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Moore said such restrictions were ``not cause for concern'' at
Genentech because the company had been able to prove the value of
its drugs to HMOs and pharmacy benefit managers.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Moore said, Activase, a clot-dissolving drug made
by Genentech, is used in the treatment of heart attack and stroke.
``At $2,200 a dose,'' he said, ``it's expensive therapy. But it can
save tens of thousands of dollars in overall costs. Patients don't
need to stay in the hospital as long, and they don't need as much
rehabilitation.''
</P>
<P>
   Prescription drugs were among the benefits that would have been
guaranteed to all Americans under President Clinton's ill-fated
plan for universal health insurance coverage in 1993-94. Under that
plan, the government would have set payment limits for many drugs
and would have required drug makers to provide discounts, in the
form of rebates to the government. Drug companies mobilized a small
army of lobbyists against those ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, many Medicare beneficiaries have obtained coverage
for prescription drugs by purchasing private insurance or by
staying in health plans run by their former employers. But the
White House contends that such coverage is eroding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fewer employers are offering retiree health coverage, and
Medigap is increasingly scarce and expensive,'' the White House
says in a document defending its new proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only 23 percent of Medicare beneficiaries are expected to have
private employer-based or Medigap insurance for drug coverage in
2000, according to the Medicare actuary _ down significantly from
1995,'' the White House says. The actuaries estimate that, by 2000,
only 17 percent of beneficiaries will have drug coverage from
former employers, while 6 percent will have Medigap policies
covering drug costs.
</P>
<P>
   More than six million Medicare beneficiaries are in HMOs, and
most have some type of drug coverage. But the White House says
these benefits ``are likely to be reduced or dropped in the
future,'' as health plans cope with budget cuts made by Congress in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Breaux's commission would have guaranteed drug coverage
for low-income beneficiaries. But the White House rejects that
approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beneficiaries across the income spectrum lack drug coverage,''
says a White House document explaining the president's plan.
``About 16 million beneficiaries are projected to have no drug
coverage in 2000. Lack of drug coverage is not just a problem for
low-income beneficiaries; 40 percent of beneficiaries without drug
coverage have income above 200 percent of poverty (about $17,000
for a single person, $23,000 for a couple in 2000).''

 COLOGNE, Germany: move forward. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Germany's defense minister, Rudfolf Scharping, described the
situation as ``very precarious'' Monday morning
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to propel the process forward, President Clinton
spoke by telephone with President Boris Yeltsin of Russia. As well,
the Finnish negotiator, Ahtisaari, who helped secure the accord
with Milosevic, flew to China Monday on a mission to convince the
Chinese not to block the Security Council resolution on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   And despite the lack of cooperation by the Russians on final
agreement of the draft, the foreign ministers reported that
considerable progress was made on major details.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the foreign ministers, including Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright, decided that the civilian leader of
Kosovo would be a special representative of the secretary-general
of the United Nations, chosen by the secretary general, State
Department spokesman James Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   The draft resolution was informally circulated among members of
the Security Council in New York on Monday afternoon, Western
diplomats said here.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanov promised to rejoin the other foreign ministers, who are
convening here under the auspices of the G-8 _ the seven richest
industrial countries and Russia _ on Tuesday morning for another
session. If the Russian said yes to the draft, the resolution could
be considered by the Security Council as early as Tuesday afternoon
in New York, officials here said.
</P>
<P>
   In a best case scenario, a Clinton administration official
traveling with Albright said Monday night that the momentum of the
security council resolution could put pressure on the Yugsolavs to
come to an arrangement with NATO for the withdrawal of their
troops.
</P>
<P>
   Once the withdrawal began, NATO would consider a suspension of
the bombing. These steps, one following the other, were described
by French officials as ``synchronization.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials said they had no quarrel with
the French notion. ``I would expect all this to happen relatively
quickly,'' an administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials here said they were satisfied that the
draft resolution made clear that the peacekeeping force of 50,000
will have a unified NATO command and control structure. The word
NATO may not be spelled out in the resolution, an official said,
but one section of the draft says that the operation will be
``performed by member states and relevant international
organizations.''
</P>
<P>
   The Russians have insisted that the United Nations have some say
in the peacekeeping operation and it appeared, the official said,
that this demand could be satisfied by the supreme commander of
NATO, Gen. Wesley Clark, making a written report to the United
Nations Security Council over specific periods.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have already crossed the Rubicon that it will not be run by
the United Nations,'' the State Department spokesman, Rubin, said
of the peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow is unwilling to have its troops work under a NATO
command.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has made clear that it would be happy
for Russian soldiers to participate in the peacekeeping force under
the same arrangements that prevail in Bosnia. There, the Russians
report to an American commander who is not the chief NATO commander
in that force. ``We'd like to see them participate,'' Rubin said
Sunday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. ADDITIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The draft Security Council resolution, which has been a work in
progress for many weeks and was fine tuned paragraph by paragraph
Monday by the foreign ministers, laid out the responsibilities of
both the peacekeepers and the civil administration, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The list of duties of the peacekeepers included enforcing a
ceasefire, ensuring the withdrawal of Yugoslav and Serbian forces,
securing the return of the ethnic Albanian refugees, taking out the
mines placed by the Serb forces and preventing the return of those
forces.
</P>
<P>
   The peacekeeping force, which will be dominated by European
soldiers and include 7,000 Americans, as well as soldiers from
non-NATO countries, would also patrol the borders, the draft
resolution says.
</P>
<P>
   The responsibilities of the civil administrator chosen by the
United Nations secretary general will include organizing elections
and policing operations. Under the terms of the agreement with
Milosevic, the Kosovo Liberation Army, is called on to disarm. That
agreement does not spell out what the ex-guerrillas would do, but
officials working on the Security Council resolution said they
would be encouraged to help form a new police corps.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear whether the draft resolution dealt with new
documentation for returning refugees, many of whom had their
identification papers, passports, educational certificates and car
licenses taken from them when they were forced out by the Serbs.
But the new civil administration would have to deal with this
question as well as physical reconstruction of the burned homes and
properties.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution also dealt with compliance required with the war
crimes tribunal in The Hague by the new authorities in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the European Union, Niko Wegter, said that
Russia had objected to the wording of the provision on the
tribunal. Milosevic, and four of his top aides including those who
ran operations in Kosovo, were indicted by the tribunal nearly two
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that because the plan agreed to by Milosevic
called for kosovo to be cleared of all Serbian and Yugoslav forces
and paramilitaries, the question of the arrest of indicted
officials _ like Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic who remained in
Bosnia after the peace agreement _ was unlikely to arise.
</P>
<P>
   But asked if the peacekeeping force would have the mandate to
arrest indicted Serb and Yugoslav officials, a senior
administration official said he would not speculate.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the planning on the resolution, there was still
nervousness among the foreign ministers' delegations about whether
Milosevic would give clear orders to his generals to move their
troops out of Kosovo or whether, even under NATO bombing, he would
chip away at the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Ahtisaari visited the foreign ministers Monday morning before
leaving for China and told them to move rapidly on finalizing the
United Nations council resolution, which is specifically called for
in the document that Milosevic agreed to.
</P>
<P>
   The Finnish president also told the gathering he had spoken to
Milosevic Monday and was told by the Yugoslav leader that he
intended to abide by the plan he agreed to last week, an
administration official said.

STARS TO TACKLE THE UNDERDOG SABRES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Yee haw.
</P>
<P>
   The Stanley Cup finals finally get under way Tuesday night with
the Dallas Stars, who are wrapping up their sixth season in the
Lone Star State, taking on the underdog Buffalo Sabres in the
best-of-seven series.
</P>
<P>
   You know it's late in the hockey year when the temperature in
Dallas (a seasonable 90-ish) is fairly close to that in Buffalo
(80-ish).
</P>
<P>
   This marks the first trip to the finals for the relocated Stars,
who last vied for the Cup under the name of the Minnesota North
Stars back in 1991. Quick, who was the goalie who led the Stars
that far? Good old Jon Casey, the ex-Bruin whose team was rubbed
out by the Penguins that year.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the Sabres made it this far was 1975, when Floyd
Smith was coach and Buffalo was eliminated in six games by the
Philadelphia Flyers. Don't talk to the Sabres about history,
though. Top center Michael Peca was all of 1 year old when that
series was played. Miroslav Satan was even younger, a mere 7
months. Goalie Dominik Hasek was a little more advanced in age (at
10) but in the Czech Republic, the Stanley Cup was not yet a dream
for the youth of his country.
</P>
<P>
   So, what do we have here? We have the NHL's best regular-season
team (the Stars) against the world's greatest goalie, who lacks
only the very trophy he's fighting for now on an otherwise
impressive resume. Recent history has favored the Western
Conference, with Detroit twice and Colorado once sweeping the
finals the last three years. The year before that, the
lockout-shortened campaign of 1994-95, it was the New Jersey Devils
sweeping the Red Wings.
</P>
<P>
   Judging by the first three series, it's patently unfair to talk
about Hasek as being the entire Sabres team. He's a crucial cog,
yes, and deserves the respect of a back-to-back Vezina Trophy and
Hart Trophy winner, but you could argue that he's no more crucial
to his team than Ed Belfour is to Dallas. Both have played well to
make it this far, but Hasek hasn't had to steal a game yet because
his teammates haven't forced him to.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to get caught up in the
Dallas-has-a-million-stars-while-Buffalo-doesn't mantra. But that
would be a little misleading. Take a look at the regular-season
statistics and you'll find that both clubs have the same number of
players with more than 40 points (seven). Yet the Stars have one
player, Mike Modano with 81 points, who far surpasses any teammate
(Brett Hull is next with 58). They have no player with 40 goals,
but the Sabres have one in Satan.
</P>
<P>
   An X-factor here, as it was earlier in the playoffs, is the
health of Hasek, who has been bothered by a groin strain since Feb.
17. Coach Lindy Ruff said Hasek will play Tuesday night, the first
game for the Sabres since May 31 (they had a similarly long layoff
after cruising past the Ottawa Senators in Round 1 and were rusty
in their second-round opener against the Bruins).
</P>
<P>
   On paper, the teams are pretty even, especially in philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a team that's built on a really sound foundation of
team play,'' said Stars coach Ken Hitchcock. ``I think the teams
have a lot of similarities. I think, first, we really both learned
a lot from losing last year. We learned a lot losing to Detroit and
I'm sure if you ask Buffalo, they learned a lot losing to
Washington (in the conference finals).
</P>
<P>
   ``We're built on the `who's the new hero?' philosophy. In other
words, we don't rely on one individual player to score for us. Both
teams diversify it through our lineups. Both teams have structured
defense groupings based on chemistry. I think the biggest
similarity when we watch their team play is they play very strong
as a group of five.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars have Hull, Joe Nieuwendyk (who has been their best
player), Belfour, Modano and a great supporting cast. The Sabres
have a world-class goalie, the best two-way center in the game in
Peca, a sensational defensive corps (starting with Alexei Zhitnik
and Jason Woolley), and a coach who deserves more credit than he's
been given.
</P>
<P>
   The finals are here, folks, and for the first time in five
years, you can forget about a sweep.

KING ASSERTS OFFICE RAID BY FBI WAS UNNECESSARY 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Fla.)  (ms) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three days after the FBI raided his Deerfield Beach, Fla.,
offices searching for information that will link him to a
racketeering investigation being conducted by the U.S. attorney's
office in Newark, N.J., the promoter Don King said that he would
have gladly given authorities any information they wanted if they
had subpoenaed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're out to humiliate and embarrass me,'' King said Monday
by telephone from his home in Deerfield Beach. ``They want to break
my spirits. They want me crying and begging and breaking down. But
it's not going to happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to give up my fundamental and organic right to
the presumption of innocence.''
</P>
<P>
   King was meeting with HBO executives in New York City when the
raid occurred. He was negotiating with them to remove a clause from
the contract for the rematch of Evander Holyfield and Lennox Lewis
that calls for King to be removed as the lead promoter if he is
indicted for any wrongdoing associated with the first
Holyfield-Lewis bout on March 13. That fight ended in a
controversial draw.
</P>
<P>
   King said he believes the government's latest pursuit of him
stems from his past and present dealings with HBO. Seth Abraham,
president of Time Warner Sports, was traveling Monday afternoon and
could not be reached for comment. Lou DiBella, the senior vice
president for programming at HBO/TVKO would not comment on what
King had to say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an agenda,'' King said. ``This has nothing to do with the
exercise of due process. They're pursuing this agenda with all due
haste. But I refuse to give up on America. I will fight, not only
for my rights, but for the rights of all Americans. I have nothing
to hide.''
</P>
<P>
   King added: ``They have manipulated political and government
institutes of power against me, and now the government is putting
blanket warrants on me hoping they can come up with something. But
I haven't done anything.''
</P>
<P>
   King said workers at his office told him that 74 FBI agents
entered his offices at 8 a.m. last Friday with warrants from the
Federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, known
as RICO. The agents told everyone to remain in certain parts of the
building while they put files and computers in boxes and loaded
them on trucks. King said they were at his offices for 12 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Holyfield-Lewis rematch in November is in serious
jeopardy because King is refusing to sign the contract with the
indictment clause in it. In lieu of signing the contract, King has
offered HBO $2 million for the United States pay-per-view rights to
the bout. The network has not responded to his offer but is
unlikely to give up the rights to a potentially lucrative bout.
</P>
<P>
   One of the sticking points that was ironed out for the first
bout could be back in a big way this time around, namely that HBO
has exclusive broadcast rights to Lewis' bouts. Holyfield is a
network free agent. &QL; 
Ayala to Fight in July
</P>
<P>
   Tony Ayala Jr., who was released from Bayside State Prison in
Leesburg, N.J., two months ago after serving 16 years on a rape
conviction, will return to the ring on July 31, said his father,
Tony Ayala Sr.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Ayala, who is acting as his son's trainer and manager,
said that they have not picked an opponent and are not sure who
will broadcast the bout, but that it will be held in San Antonio,
Ayala's hometown. Ayala, who plans to fight as a junior
middleweight (154 pounds), returned to training at his father's gym
in San Antonio two weeks ago. Forty seconds into his first session,
he knocked down his sparring partner. Ayala, 37, was the No.
1-ranked junior-middleweight contender when he went to prison in
1981. &QL;

 &HT;    Lexis-Nexis parent expects profits dip in '99
 &HT;    By Laura A. Bischoff
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Reed Elsevier plc, the parent company of
Lexis-Nexis, said Monday it expects lower profits in 1999 because
of weak advertising trends in one segment and fierce competition in
the online legal and business information market.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Reed Elsevier announced profits were flat in 1998 and
1999 didn't look much better. The Anglo-Dutch publisher on Monday
told institutional investors in New York that 1999 revenues would
likely fall below 1998 numbers but would not say how much lower.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the first half of the year, we are just warning the
market,'' said Paul Richardson, Reed Elsevier Inc. vice president
of finance. A mid-year fiscal report is expected Aug. 5.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said Reed Elsevier has seen weak advertising revenues
in Cahners, which produces a variety of trade publications, and
intense competition for Lexis-Nexis in the online information
business.
</P>
<P>
   Lexis-Nexis, which has 7,800 employees worldwide, including
2,400 in Miami Twp., provides legal information and citations to
lawyers and online business and news information to the general
public.
</P>
<P>
   Lexis' chief rival, Thomson Corp.'s Westlaw, has launched an
intense marketing campaign while Lexis-Nexis has been busy
developing products for late 1999 and absorbing two purchases:
Matthew Bender &AMP; Co. and Shepard's Co., Richardson said. Nexis,
which provides news and business information, faces increasing
competition from Internet sources.
</P>
<P>
   Reed Elsevier bought Lexis-Nexis from Mead Corp. in 1994 for
$1.5 billion and has since bought Matthew Bender &AMP; Co., the
country's leading publisher of analytical legal information, and
Shepard's Co., the leading U.S. legal citation publisher.
</P>
<P>
   Lexis-Nexis is an important component of Reed Elsevier's
portfolio. Last year, Lexis-Nexis' $1.23 billion in sales made up
nearly 24 percent of Reed Elsevier's $5.2 billion in revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Reed Elsevier's announcement on Monday led analysts to downgrade
the stock. Reed International's stock price fell 6.9 percent while
Elsevier's price dipped 3.6 percent. Reed (NYSE:RUK) closed at 28,
down 2, while Elsevier (NYSE:ENL) closed at 24, down 15/16.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Reed Elsevier has been searching for a new chief
executive for nearly a year. Reed Elsevier is co-owned by Reed
International plc in London and Elsevier NV in Amsterdam. Last
August, the two companies announced they would ditch a co-chairman
management system and have been searching for a chief executive
since then. The top candidate backed out this year and two board
members resigned in protest over the search process. Richardson
said the search committee is still working off the short list of
finalists.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson declined comment on how the fiscal picture might
affect the search or when a new chief executive may be selected.

RUSSIA HOLDS BACK ON ENDORSING RESOLUTION TO END KOSOVO CRISIS 
</HEADLINE>

version of a story that will appear in tomorrow's New York Times.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   COLOGNE, Germany _ After eight hours of negotiations, Russia
balked on Monday at final approval of a resolution to be sent to
the Security Council to lay out the future of Kosovo and the role
of 50,000 NATO peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   The draft resolution is being worked out by foreign ministers of
the leading industrial countries and Russia. Participants said much
progress had been made Monday, and perhaps 90 percent of the work
on the resolution has been agreed to.
</P>
<P>
   But problems about the role of NATO in the peacekeeping force
remain.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiators, especially Russia and the Europeans, want the
Security Council to approve such a resolution detailing the sketchy
document that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic agreed to last
week, which called for a U.N. role. The resolution is also meant to
give authority to the peacekeeping force and the civil
administration that is planned for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, said he needed to
have further consultations with Moscow. The Russians, through their
emissary Viktor Chermonyrdin, helped secure the agreement last
week. But if they change their mind and block a NATO dominated
force, under U.N. authority, that would be a setback to the peace
effort.
</P>
<P>
   Military to military talks in Macedonia to work out withdrawal
schedules for Yugoslav and Serbian troops from Kosovo were
downgraded to low level officials Monday, after the Yugoslavs made
what the State Department called unacceptable proposals to keep
15,000 soldiers in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But NATO held back on carrying out threats to intensify its
bombing of Yugoslavia if Belgrade did not promptly accept allied
terms on Kosovo. Allied officials said they hoped that the
restraint would help persuade Russia to back a United Nations
Security Council resolution on ending the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   But there was NATO bombing in Kosovo near the Albanian border,
and at night, explosions and anti-aircraft fire were heard once
again in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials here said they were satisfied that the
draft resolution made clear that the peacekeeping force of 50,000
will have a unified NATO command and control structure. The word
NATO may not be spelled out in the resolution, an official said,
but one section of the draft says that the operation will be
``performed by member states and relevant international
organizations.''

   MORINA, Albania _ On Saturday, Niman Kurti was in a Kosovo
prison, crammed in with hundreds of other ethnic Albanian men who
say they were being beaten and nearly starved.
</P>
<P>
   Kurti had no idea that two days earlier, Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milsevic had signed an a NATO-imposed peace plan that
promised he would begin pulling out military forces from the
province and allow Kosovar refugees to return home.

<P>
   He had no idea where his family was, or whether he would survive

 WASHINGTON: now pay. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Walter K. Moore, a vice president of Genentech, a biotechnology
company based in South San Francisco, said today, ``We're
encouraged when we hear that the president's plan won't include
explicit price controls.''
</P>
<P>
   Pharmacy benefit managers and HMOs typically establish lists of
preferred drugs, known as formularies, and recommend low-cost
generic versions of brand-name drugs. Sometimes they also require
doctors to get approval before prescribing certain drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Moore said such restrictions were ``not cause for concern'' at
Genentech because the company had been able to prove the value of
its drugs to HMOs and pharmacy benefit managers.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Moore said, Activase, a clot-dissolving drug made
by Genentech, is used in the treatment of heart attack and stroke.
``At $2,200 a dose,'' he said, ``it's expensive therapy. But it can
save tens of thousands of dollars in overall costs. Patients don't
need to stay in the hospital as long, and they don't need as much
rehabilitation.''
</P>
<P>
   Prescription drugs were among the benefits that would have been
guaranteed to all Americans under President Clinton's ill-fated
plan for universal health insurance coverage in 1993-94. Under that
plan, the government would have set payment limits for many drugs
and would have required drug makers to provide discounts, in the
form of rebates to the government. Drug companies mobilized a small
army of lobbyists against those ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, many Medicare beneficiaries have obtained coverage
for prescription drugs by purchasing private insurance or by
staying in health plans run by their former employers. But the
White House contends that such coverage is eroding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fewer employers are offering retiree health coverage, and
Medigap is increasingly scarce and expensive,'' the White House
says in a document defending its new proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only 23 percent of Medicare beneficiaries are expected to have
private employer-based or Medigap insurance for drug coverage in
2000, according to the Medicare actuary _ down significantly from
1995,'' the White House says. The actuaries estimate that, by 2000,
only 17 percent of beneficiaries will have drug coverage from
former employers, while 6 percent will have Medigap policies
covering drug costs.
</P>
<P>
   More than six million Medicare beneficiaries are in HMOs, and
most have some type of drug coverage. But the White House says
these benefits ``are likely to be reduced or dropped in the
future,'' as health plans cope with budget cuts made by Congress in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Breaux's commission would have guaranteed drug coverage
for low-income beneficiaries. But the White House rejects that
approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beneficiaries across the income spectrum lack drug coverage,''
says a White House document explaining the president's plan.
``About 16 million beneficiaries are projected to have no drug
coverage in 2000. Lack of drug coverage is not just a problem for
low-income beneficiaries; 40 percent of beneficiaries without drug
coverage have income above 200 percent of poverty (about $17,000
for a single person, $23,000 for a couple in 2000).''

<P>
   An unseasonably miserable front of hot and humid weather
enveloped the Northeast and Atlantic seaboard Monday, establishing
single-day record high temperatures from the nation's capital to
Newark, N.J., to Portland, Maine, making the region seem about as
pleasant as a sponge bath inside a baking oven.
</P>
<P>
   It is expected to be worse on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   For one of those bizarre days that help explain why people talk
so incessantly about the weather, the meteorological world was
turned upside down: It was hotter in Portland (95 degrees), Boston
(97 degrees), and Burlington, Vt. (94 degrees) _ all records _ than
in Houston, which was 88. The swelter in Hartford (a record 98)
made New Orleans (89) seem almost pleasant.
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers had to settle for a boiling wet sock of a day that
hit 94 degrees but failed to break any records (96 degrees, 1925).
The average high for Monday in New York's Central Park is 78
degrees, but the heat index, that mysterious formula of heat and
humidity that always equals misery, registered 100. Outside the
city, the heat index was 105 or more.
</P>
<P>
   Smokers steamed on sidewalks outside air-conditioned office
buildings. Nearly 172,000 people flocked to city beaches Monday,
according to the Parks Department, compared with only 20,000 last
Tuesday. Mothers at a playground in Brooklyn jumped with their
toddlers beneath the sprinklers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so unbearably hot,'' said Victoria Gonzalez, explaining
why she stood beneath the sprinklers, fully clothed, with her
year-old daughter, Gianna.
</P>
<P>
   It was the sort of day that only a weather junkie could love:
Joseph Petta, a spokesman for Con Edison, the utility serving 3
million customers in New York City and Westchester County, N.Y.,
said the company registered the third highest demand for
electricity in its history. He estimated that the 10,912 megawatt
demand at 5 p.m. was the equivalent of 10.9 million window
air-conditioning units being turned on at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   The Long Island Power Authority also hit peak demand late in the
afternoon, though 1,400 unlucky customers were without electricity
for several hours because of minor mishaps.
</P>
<P>
   The high temperatures began as far south as Washington, which
registered 98 degrees to shatter its 100-year record of 97, and in
Baltimore, which hit a record of 96. The regional high mark of the
day came in Newark, which touched 99 degrees, another record.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's actually going to be pretty hot again, if not hotter,''
said Jeff Warner, a meteorologist at Pennsylvania State University,
delivering the unwelcome forecast.
</P>
<P>
   Warner said a strong high pressure system to the south has
brought the region weather patterns more like July or August than
early June. But he also said the siege should be short, with
temperatures in New York likely to drop quickly into the 70s by
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout New York City on Monday, the soggy heat sat heavily
atop the city. The police reported an unusually slow day, perhaps
because criminals did not have the energy or will to go outside.
Street vendors thrived or suffered depending on their goods. At his
newsstand at 110th Street and Broadway on the Upper West Side,
Pervaiz Burki said he sold his entire supply of bottled water and
three dozen sodas within two hours. But if the heat helped
business, it made his life miserable inside the stand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a fan but it's still hot,'' said Burki, a native of
Pakistan, as he shook sweat from his shirt. ``I step outside for
five minutes, fix the papers and back in.''
</P>
<P>
   On Montague Street in Brooklyn Heights, vendor Mike Hill had
slashed prices of the ties on his outdoor table from $2 to $1, but
his customers were inside, ordering lunch by delivery instead of
walking outside. With a bank sign reading a temperature of 94
degrees behind him, Hill announced that business would soon end for
the day. ``I'm going to head to the beach, for real,'' he said.
``I'm outta here.''
</P>
<P>
   In Manhattan, Ana Ally, 6, a kindergarten student at Bank Street
School for Children, waited in line with her mother, Biliana Ally,
for Italian ices. She did not mind the heat one bit. ``I'm hot, so
my mother's getting me ices,'' Ana said. ``I know it's 100 degrees
in the desert, and I hope it gets to be 100 degrees today. Then I
can eat more ices.''
</P>
<P>
   Allister O'Brien, 33, a graphic designer from Dublin, Ireland,
was not so cheery. ``I was out scouting business opportunities, but
it's disgusting,'' he said. ``I almost melted. I'm going back into
my air-conditioned room. In Dublin, it's pouring rain and 45
degrees. It always is. That's what I'm used to.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There is always someone, of course, who scoffs at weather, hot
or cold, which might explain Edwin Vega, 40. In the middle of the
day, Vega stood on Erie Basin in Brooklyn fishing for striped bass.
There was no shade, not much wind, no trees, nothing. He wore blue
jeans and tinted sunglasses and stood on the concrete and did not
sweat, not a single bead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's actually cool out here,'' he announced coolly as the bell
jangled at the end of his pole, announcing a strike that he would
miss. He said he didn't mind standing outside for several hours
because his alternative was staying home and refereeing his five
children and nephews.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty feet away, Jack Osorio, 33, was also fishing, but from
the inside of his purple Chevrolet Lumina. ``When it's hot like
that, when it's in the 100s, the best thing to do is to be in the
car with the air conditioning on and watch the pole move,'' Osorio
said. When he sees the pole twitch, he jumps out to grab it.
</P>
<P>
   Osorio then looked at Vega and shook his head. ``See, I'm
sweating,'' he said. ``He's got the cool spirit.''

GUNMEN KILL POPULAR TELEVISION HOST IN AMBUSH

<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ In a gangland-style ambush outside a major
broadcast studio, gunmen fired automatic rifles and killed a
popular television host and a bystander on Monday. A reporter and
other bystanders were injured.
</P>
<P>
   Both major television networks reacted with live nationwide
broadcasts for several hours.
</P>
<P>
   The attack drew new expressions of outrage about violent crime
that many Mexicans say is out of control.
</P>
<P>
   The victim, Francisco Stanley, was host of a morning variety
show on TV Azteca, his latest post in a lengthy career. City
officials said he was 57. His colleagues suggested in their live
coverage that the attack might have been a frustrated kidnapping
attempt, but offered no evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The journalist who was injured in the attack is Jorge Gil,
another broadcast figure on TV Azteca. The ambush occurred an hour
or so after Stanley's show, as he and Gil drove out of a parking
lot of a taco restaurant alongside the studio, where they had eaten
a late-morning snack. A parking attendant, Juan Manuel de Jesus
Nunez, also died.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a new example of the tremendous insecurity we all
suffer in this city,'' Police Superintendent Alejandro Gertz Manero
of Mexico City said in a broadcast interview. ``It's a reality we
all have to confront. I feel the pain more than anybody because I
live this crisis every day.''
</P>
<P>
   The police were reported to have found 26 bullets around
Stanley's black minivan. The two networks broadcast repeated images
showing the van windows, shattered by gunfire, with mobs of
bystanders and reporters around the chaotic scene.
</P>
<P>
   Recent opinion polls show many Mexicans rank violent crime as
their biggest worry, even ahead of the economic fears that have
been the public's No. 1 concern since a peso devaluaion in 1994.

CONSERVATES FORCING WHITMAN TO RECONSIDER HER MODERATE POSITIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JERRY GRAY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ It would seem easy to predict how Gov. Christie
Whitman, one of the nation's most prominent Republican moderates,
would deal with a string of conservative proposals that may be
headed her way in the next few months.
</P>
<P>
   Require parental consent for a teen-ager to get a tattoo or have
an ear pierced? Surely Whitman would not support it.
</P>
<P>
   Require that public schools begin each day by reciting a line
from the Declaration of Independence about life, liberty and the
pursuit of happiness? Hardly a Whitman kind of thing.
</P>
<P>
   Ban same-sex marriages? Unthinkable for a politician with a
strong record defending the rights of gays and lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   But as Whitman prepares for the next step in her political
career, a race next year for an open U.S. Senate seat, New Jersey
conservatives are making it abundantly clear to her that she will
have to yield ground on those very issues and others if she hopes
to hold on to their crucial _ but increasingly shaky _ support.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman won her two races for governor by less than 1 percent of
the vote, making conservative support critical, especially because
the Senate race is in a presidential election year, when many
traditionally Democratic urban voters are likely to go to the
polls. So the governor, whose standing among conservatives has
weakened over the years largely because of her moderate views on
social issues, needs every vote she can get.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, for the first time in her political life, the
governor gave a nod of approval to legislation that would require
parental notification before an unmarried girl under 18 could have
a legal abortion. It was the first of a number of tough choices
that lay ahead for Whitman as Republicans in the Assembly,
concerned about preserving their majority in elections this fall,
are openly courting conservative voters for their support.
</P>
<P>
   Committees have already approved and sent to the full Assembly
legislation requiring that abstinence be taught as the only
completely reliable means of avoiding pregnancy and sexually
transmitted diseases. The same for a measure requiring parental
consent for tattoos and body piercing of minors, and the proposal
to mandate that elementary and secondary school principals and
teachers begin each school day by reciting an excerpt from the
Declaration of Independence.
</P>
<P>
   The excerpt in question includes the phrase ``that all men are
created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain
unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the
pursuit of happiness.'' Some Democratic critics contend that the
measure is really a subtle attempt to further the anti-abortion
argument: they note that among the unalienable rights is ``life,''
and opponents of abortion describe themselves as ``pro-life.''
Supporters of the bill scoff at that assertion.
</P>
<P>
   Another bill _ the one that would prohibit same-sex marriages in
New Jersey _has been introduced, and its backers are pushing for it
to be considered in the current legislative session, which ends in
January.
</P>
<P>
   Even if some or all of the measures win approval in the
Assembly, their approval is less certain in the more moderate
Senate. But many conservative lawmakers in the Assembly want to go
on record about these social issues before the November elections,
and they want Whitman to take public positions as well.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, who hold a 48-to-32 majority in the Assembly, said
that the spate of legislation is intended to draw a clear
distinction between them and Democrats before the elections. But
the maneuvering and pressure to speak out present a quandary for
Whitman, who despite her conservative credentials on education,
crime and fiscal policies has consistently embraced moderate
positions on abortion and on gay rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's been conservative on many, many issues,'' Assembly
Speaker Jack Collins said. ``But what it usually comes down to is,
she is pro-choice and so the media and the people don't view her as
a conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   In her two races for governor, Whitman won each time with 49
percent of the vote _ with conservatives forming the base of her
support and independents and crossover Democrats giving her the
victory edge. Registered Democrats outnumber registered Republicans
25.8 percent to 19.5 percent in New Jersey. But independent voters,
with about 55 percent, top both of the major parties combined,
making it risky for a candidate for statewide office to swing too
wide in either political direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The irony for Whitman is that in a state with a minority of
Republican voters she must appeal to moderates and independents,
but Republicans still have to count on the conservative vote to
win,'' said David P. Rebovich, a political science professor at
Rider University. ``For a governor who has won her last two races
by 30,000 votes, it doesn't take too many conservatives to stay
home or to jump ship to sink her political future.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitman's gubernatorial victories were in 1993 and 1997, when
the turnout in the traditionally Democratic-voting urban areas was
at best moderate, and conservatives, despite some defections, stood
behind her. But she has never run for office in a presidential
election year when the turnout is usually stronger across the
board, especially in urban areas, which are Democratic strongholds.
</P>
<P>
   That has made the support from the right wing of her party all
the more imperative for Whitman, and conservatives have moved
swiftly to demand some payments in advance for that support.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every piece of legislation has political consequences, whether
you are dealing with kid care or open space,'' said John Tomicki,
the executive director of the League of American Families, a
conservative advocacy group that led the fight for the parental
notification legislation and has helped lobby for the four other
conservative measures that the Assembly is expected to take up. ``I
would hope that Governor Whitman, who has at times called herself a
Rockefeller Republican, has seen that the public really sides with
a more conservative agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Salmore, a Republican political consultant and a political
science professor emeritus at Rutgers University, said that Whitman
has not done the kind of fence-building that can insure her loyalty
from social conservatives.

MARKET PLACE: A MERGER MADE IN HEAVEN AND APPLAUDED ON WALL
STREET

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Now here's a deal that Wall Street really seems to
like.
</P>
<P>
   If past mergers were any indication, investors would have taken
their Honeywell Inc. profits on Monday, after the company and
Allied Signal Inc. announced their deal and spelled out the terms.
And if past patterns held, Allied's share price would have, at
best, not moved at all.
</P>
<P>
   After all, investors had already followed the common practice,
once word leaked out last Friday that Allied, the big diversified
manufacturer, would join forces with Honeywell, a maker of
electronic controls that is half its size.
</P>
<P>
   On the assumption that Allied would be the acquirer and would
take a financial hit, investors bid Honeywell's stock up in late
trading on Friday, and pushed Allied's shares down $2.
</P>
<P>
   But apparently, someone rewrote the textbook of conventional
wisdom over the weekend. By the time the market closed Monday,
investors had bid up Honeywell stock an additional $7, to $112. And
Allied was the biggest percentage gainer among stocks in the Dow
Jones industrial average, up $4.4375, to $62.8125.
</P>
<P>
   Based on those numbers, the deal, structured as a tax-free swap
of 1.875 shares of Allied stock for each share of Honeywell, is
valued at $14.8 billion _ $2 billion more than when the market
closed on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   So why the break with usual investment practice?
</P>
<P>
   Talks with analysts and investors found a sense of relief at the
financial terms and immediate financial prospects; a firm belief
that the combined company really would be better than the sum of
its parts, and a vote of confidence in Michael R. Bonsignore, the
Honeywell chief who will run the company when Lawrence A. Bossidy,
Allied's chief executive, retires next April.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's got so many things going for it,'' said Michael Holton,
an investment analyst at T. Rowe Price Associates, the
Baltimore-based mutual fund company, which has Honeywell and Allied
stock in its portfolios. ``It's a friendly deal; that's accretive
to earnings. It answers the Bossidy succession question, which has
hung like a cloud over Allied's stock. And it's created a business
portfolio that is simply stronger than either company had on its
own.''
</P>
<P>
   Holton's view is not unique. After Bonsignore and Bossidy laid
out the numbers, and their plans, at a meeting for analysts and the
news media Monday morning, analysts spent the rest of the day
generating positive reports on the merger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wall Street simply loved what it heard,'' said H. Giles
Knight, a principal of Allied Investment Advisers in Baltimore,
which also includes Honeywell shares in its portfolios.
</P>
<P>
   Just as important, the Street loved what it did not hear.
</P>
<P>
   ``People figured this would be a dilutive cash acquisition, that
Allied would take out its checkbook and overpay,'' said Nicholas P.
Heymann, an analyst at Prudential Securities. ``Instead, it's a
true strategic deal.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal will probably close as early as September, and the two
companies would be integrated and acting as one entity, to be
called Honeywell International, a few months after that.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike so many mergers, in which the costs of completing the
deal and integrating the companies requires either a big write-off
against earnings or a drain on profit for several quarters, this
one is structured so that it will be beneficial to earnings per
share from Day 1. The company may take a charge in the fourth
quarter, to account for the inevitable expenses of terminating
4,500 people of a combined 125,000 employees. But Bonsignore said
that the cost savings and added revenue from the merger would kick
in so quickly that the effect will add 17 cents to earnings a share
in 2000, rising to 32 cents a share by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the two companies' businesses fit like jigsaw
puzzles, selling complementary products and sharing, rather than
competing for, many of the same customers. Honeywell is a leading
maker of industrial, aviation and electronic controls. Allied is a
leading supplier of aircraft engines and controls, braking systems
for planes and trucks, and specialty chemicals. Both companies are
seeking more revenue from services _ like designing energy systems
for factories, in Honeywell's case, or maintaining fleets of planes
in Allied's. And both have made significant progress in using the
Internet to buy and sell products.
</P>
<P>
   The synergy is particularly apparent in the aerospace industry,
which the merged company expects will account for $10.5 billion, or
40 percent, of its revenue. Honeywell is a leader in navigational
controls, while Allied is a leader in surveillance controls. By
combining their two technologies, the two companies can offer a
takeoff-to-landing control system for aviation that covers safety
systems inside the plane, in the air-traffic controller's tower, or
at any remote location where someone wants to know where a plane is
at any time.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is definitely going to be a powerhouse company in the
aerospace field,'' concluded Jon B. Kutler, president of
Quarterdeck Investment Partners, a Los Angeles investment banking
firm that specializes in aerospace industry deals.
</P>
<P>
   That presumed power, of course, raises the specter of antitrust
problems. But Bossidy and Bonsignore said that Boeing, which is a
major customer for both companies, is publicly supporting the deal.
``The Federal authorities are generally easier on deals that the
major customers don't see as anticompetitive,'' Kutler said.
</P>
<P>
   What may have also helped both companies' stock price Monday is
that investors got a much closer look at Bonsignore, who is not
nearly as well known as Bossidy. ``At that meeting, Mike took the
initiative on questions, really acted like someone who has the
right stuff, who's really chairman-designate material,'' Heymann of
Prudential said.
</P>
<P>
   Bonsignore thinks that the meeting helped Honeywell's image,
too. The company's earnings and stock price have performed well in
the last three years, he noted, but too many people have still
thought of it as the lackluster maker of home thermostats and other
low-tech gadgetry that it was up through the mid-1990's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Friday's sharp rise in our stock was based on rumors that
Honeywell's shareholders would receive a premium,'' Bonsignore said
in an interview on Monday. ``But now, investors are finally
recognizing us as the knowledge-based, technology-driven company
that we are.''

MILOSEVIC VOWS STEPS TO PEACE, BUT ALLIES DOUBT IT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CRAGG HINES 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
promised Monday to advance the lifeless Kosovo peace process, a
U.S. official said, but NATO leaders were doubtful and the alliance
began heavier bombardment of Serb positions.
</P>
<P>
   Russia played for a bigger part in the Balkans conflict, seeking
to guarantee a role for the United Nations, where the Kremlin is
one of five nations with veto power in the Security Council. State
Department spokesman James Rubin said President Martti Ahtisaari of
Finland, an emissary in the Kosovo peace deal agreed to last week
by Milosevic, talked with the Yugoslav leader Monday ``and told him
there was a need to move ahead with the agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Milosevic said he intends to do so,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   NATO spokesman Jamie Shea, at alliance headquarters in Brussels
voiced the doubts of many alliance officials when he noted that
with Milosevic there must be agreement on principles and details
and, finally, ``full implementation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Then you know you have an agreement'' with Milosevic, Shea
said.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin spoke with reporters in Bonn, Germany, where Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright met with counterparts from six other
leading industrial nations and Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov.
</P>
<P>
   Ahtisaari, who informed the foreign ministers of his talk with
Milosevic, flew to Bonn to participate in the session rather than
flying to Beijing. He may go later to the Chinese capital to
attempt to sell the peace plan to President Jiang Zemin of China,
another nation that has been critical of the NATO air campaign and
also has a veto in the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   Russian Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin, speaking to Interfax
news agency, renewed his demand that NATO bombing ``immediately
cease.'' A Russian diplomat was quoted as saying Moscow will not
agree in the Security Council to a resolution authorizing an
international force for Kosovo until NATO calls off the airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, President Clinton spoke to Russia President Boris
Yeltsin for 10 minutes by telephone, but the critical issue of the
command structure for a NATO-led international force was not
discussed, said Joe Lockhart, the White House spokesman. He also
said Yeltsin did not ask for a bombing pause. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; ``It was a very constructive call,'' Lockhart said, adding both
presidents ``affirmed that the implementation'' of the peace plan
``should form the basis for a peaceful settlement of conflict and
the suspension of NATO's air campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said both presidents also agreed to instruct their
foreign ministers ``to move quickly to work out the details of that
agreement.'' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Clinton also spoke to British Prime Minister Tony Blair, his
closest ally in NATO. ``They are very much in agreement on our
basic points. The NATO air campaign will continue until we see the
beginnings of a verifiable withdrawal, until the agreement is
implemented,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   The foreign ministers meeting near the old German capital sought
to hammer out final details on how the multinational force would be
structured, including a way to finesse Russia's refusal to allow
its troops in the contingent to function directly under a NATO
commander. The senior diplomats planned to seek an emergency
session of the Security Council in New York as soon as a proposed
resolution was completed.
</P>
<P>
   The United States believes U.N. approval is not required for the
multinational military contingent to follow departing Serb forces
into Kosovo, but there is division in NATO on the point, and Russia
appeared to be attempting to exacerbate the disagreements.
</P>
<P>
   Nations embroiled in the Kosovo crisis scrambled for new ground
Monday after the peace process collapsed when Yugoslav generals
refused to sign the NATO-mandated withdrawal agreement.
</P>
<P>
   NATO spokesman Jamie Shea contended at alliance headquarters in
Brussels that ``the talks have not broken off.'' But, at the same
time, he conceded that no formal talks were scheduled between Lt.
Gen. Michael Jackson, the Briton representing NATO in the
discussions, and ranking Yugoslav officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``The flap to his tent remains open,'' Shea said of Jackson's
willingness to resume discussions with sincere Yugoslav
representatives who ``are ready to talk business .... If the
Yugoslavs are having second thoughts, believe me, they know which
number to ring.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We want this agreement,'' Shea said, but the final plan must
be ``totally consistent'' with NATO demands. The only contacts
between the two sides Monday were logistical details, such as
making certain telephone lines were working.
</P>
<P>
   Shea said NATO might allow the Yugoslav forces more than a week
to withdraw, another point of objection in the talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's really something which is not fundamental, which is a
question of a day here or a day there, then NATO is prepared to
look at that as long as the overall objective of the rapid,
verifiable and total withdrawal of Serb forces is agreed,'' Shea
told CNN.
</P>
<P>
   NATO said that airstrikes against Yugoslavia were ``accelerating
toward their prior intensity'' before the peace plan deal Thursday.
Jertz said targets were primarily Yugoslav forces on the ground in
Kosovo, especially along the Albanian border.
</P>
<P>
   Initial reports, Jertz said, were that Serb ground units ``had
to suffer some heavy losses'' as NATO bore down on armored
personnel carriers and artillery pieces.

MICROSOFT BINDS OFFICE SOFTWARE MORE TIGHTLY TO INTERNET
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Referring to documents and recalling first-hand
experience, an IBM executive on Monday provided the most detailed
allegations yet to surface in the Microsoft antitrust trial of how
the big software maker wields its market power to pressure personal
computer makers to favor Microsoft's products.
</P>
<P>
   The executive, Garry Norris, testified that when he objected to
the price and terms under which the Microsoft Corp. offered its
industry-standard Windows operating system to the International
Business Machines Corp., he heard the take-it-or-leave-it arrogance
of a monopolist.
</P>
<P>
   Norris told the court that a Microsoft executive had said to
him: ``This is the only game in town. Where else are you going to
go?''
</P>
<P>
   During a day of friendly questioning from a government lawyer,
Norris told of Microsoft's using its market power to pressure IBM
to reduce its support for competing products, to increase prices
and to restrict the freedom IBM had to control the initial screen
that users see on its personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft denies the allegations by Norris, a program director
in IBM's networking hardware division, who handled relations
between the IBM PC business and Microsoft from 1995 to 1997. It
says that he is exaggerating what were complex negotiations between
two companies that competed in some businesses and cooperated in
others. The terms and prices IBM received for Windows, Microsoft
says, were the result not of Microsoft's bullying but of business
decisions IBM chose to make.
</P>
<P>
   And the Microsoft executive who, Norris testified, told him that
Windows was the ``only game in town'' insisted that he never made
the comment. ``Absolutely not _ it's not in my character to say
something like that,'' the executive, Mark Baber, who has retired
from Microsoft, said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the day of testimony by Norris, unless refuted during
cross-examination, appeared to lend new ammunition to the
government's case. Some of his accusations had been made in a
pretrial deposition last month, but Monday's testimony made further
allegations and added new details to previous allegations. And his
testimony was backed up by new documents entered into evidence
Monday, including internal IBM memos as well as letters and e-mail
between the two companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is some of the most important evidence in the case,''
said David Boies, the lead trial lawyer for the justice department.
``It shows Microsoft, once again, going to a competitor and trying
to persuade it or pressure it not to compete. This conduct is a
clear violation of the antitrust laws.''
</P>
<P>
   In his testimony, Norris contended that Microsoft refused to
offer IBM as low a price for Microsoft's Windows operating system
as was offered to its leading competitors unless IBM ``reduced or
eliminated'' support for OS/2, IBM's competing operating system.
</P>
<P>
   In talks before Microsoft's introduction of Windows 95, Norris
contended that Microsoft also said IBM would pay a higher price for
Windows if IBM continued to heavily promote the SmartSuite office
productivity software, made by IBM's Lotus division, which competes
with Microsoft Office product.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1995, with the August introduction of Windows 95
approaching fast, IBM was the last major PC maker without a Windows
license. Microsoft said it would not sign a Windows deal with IBM
until a simmering dispute over past royalty payments had been
settled, Norris contended.
</P>
<P>
   According to Norris, all these conflicts with Microsoft held a
single message _ and one that, he says, Microsoft executives
delivered to him personally time and again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was told that as long as you compete against Microsoft,''
Norris said, ``you will suffer in terms of pricing and support.''

   &UR; Deducting Mortgage Interest On a Rental Building &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: I'm planning to buy a three-unit residential building. I will be
living in one unit and renting the two others. I thought I would be
able to deduct the entire amount of mortgage interest from my
income in figuring my taxes, but a friend told me that I am allowed
to deduct only one-third. Is this so? If it is, what happens to the
other two-thirds?
</P>
<P>
   A: One way or another, you can deduct all the mortgage interest.
Here's how it works:
</P>
<P>
   You split the house (figuratively speaking) into two parts: the
part used for your residence and the part used for rental. Find out
the square footage of each.
</P>
<P>
   Let's say, for the sake of simplicity, that the residential
portion is exactly one-third of the total. Then you can deduct
one-third of the mortgage interest _ and also one-third of your
real-estate taxes _ on Schedule A of Internal Revenue Service Form
1040.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining two-thirds of your interest and real-estate taxes
gets deducted on Schedule E, where you report your real-estate
income. Also on that schedule, you can deduct two-thirds of your
homeowners insurance, as well as certain other expenses such as
utility costs (if you are paying the utility bills for your
tenants). Other potential deductions include repair and maintenance
costs. Such deductions wouldn't be allowed if you used the entire
building as your residence.
</P>
<P>
   So, buying a rental building can make good sense _ until the
first time your tenants turn up the stereo.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Why Is EU Meddling?
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: Recently I read that the European Union approved the proposal
by Lucent Technologies to buy Ascend Communications. Both those
companies are based in the United States, so where does the EU get
off deciding whether they can merge?
</P>
<P>
   A: Welcome to the global economy.
</P>
<P>
   The European Commission, an arm of the EU, has the authority to
block or modify mergers between companies with total worldwide
sales of around $5 billion or more and EU sales of around $250
million or more. It wants to prevent companies, foreign or
domestic, from getting a stranglehold on markets or industries
within the EU. If the EU disapproves a merger, the parties have the
choice of calling the merger off or withdrawing at least some of
their business from European markets. Some choice.
</P>
<P>
   The Lucent-Ascend deal also has been cleared by the U.S.
Department of Justice. The last hurdle, if you can call it that, is
a meeting of Ascend shareholders on June 24. If they approve _ and
why shouldn't they, since the price they are being offered is about
30 percent more than their stock was worth before Lucent proposed
marriage _ the deal will be consummated immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent shareholders don't have to vote.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &LR;   &LR; Cost Basis of Gift
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am having trouble figuring the cost basis of stock I own _
which I need to know to figure my capital-gains tax when I sell. I
was given the stock by my grandfather and grandmother through a
trust. The problem is that both of them have died, and I haven't
the foggiest idea what they paid for the stock. Does this mean I
have to use a cost basis of zero? I have spoken to two tax
preparers about this, but they gave me conflicting advice.
</P>
<P>
   A: Internal Revenue Service spokesman Jesse Weller says the
answer depends in part on what kind of trust your grandparents
created _ an irrevocable trust, or a revocable living trust.
</P>
<P>
   If it was a revocable trust, then the stock belonged to your
grandparents throughout their lifetimes; possession didn't pass to
you until the second grandparent died. In that case, your cost
basis is determined the same way it is with inheritances. It is
marked up to the price of the stock on the date of death.
</P>
<P>
   However, if the trust was irrevocable, your cost basis for the
stock would be the same price your grandparents paid for it. If
that is the case, then _ as you say _ you have a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Weller says that if you make a good-faith effort to determine
the cost, and fully document your effort, the IRS won't force you
to use a cost basis of zero. Instead, you can use the purchase
price that seems most probable.
</P>
<P>
   You should go through your grandparents' papers and see if you
can find the appropriate brokerage statements, or the confirmation
slips the broker was required to send after each transaction. Also,
ask the brokerage firm whether it still has records of the stock
purchases.
</P>
<P>
   If that doesn't work, pick a likely date _ or range of dates _
on which the purchases might have been made. One possible starting
point would be the date that the trust was established. A broker
can supply you with the prices of any stock for any date you
choose.

Traveling outside the United States this summer? Advance planning
can shield you against surcharges of 2 to 4 percent on credit card
purchases.
<P>
   For years, credit cards were touted as the best way to pay for
purchases when traveling abroad. That's because exchange rates were
among the best and transaction costs were low.
</P>
<P>
   That's not necessarily true anymore. Some credit card issuers
quietly are slapping fees on consumers who use their credit cards
in foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
   The trend began a year ago when Providian Financial Corp.
started charging its credit card customers a whopping 4 percent fee
for overseas credit card purchases. Citibank followed with a 2
percent fee and First USA with a 3 percent fee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt the fee was needed to offset the higher costs we
experience to service foreign transactions,'' said Citibank
spokeswoman Maria Menzler.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates are skeptical. ``It's just another example of
unjustified bank fees that aren't at all cost based,'' said Ken
McEldowney, executive director of Consumer Action, a San Francisco
nonprofit advocacy organization. ``It's designed to boost bank
profits.''
</P>
<P>
   For all three issuers, and those that followed, the fee came on
top of the 1 percent foreign exchange fee that Visa and MasterCard
each have charged for years to clear foreign transactions.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a while, it looked like the surcharge would cascade
through the industry, but a number of us raised a howl and the
stampede stopped,'' said Ed Perkins, a syndicated travel columnist
in Ashland, Ore., and former editor of Consumer Reports' travel
newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, First USA has rescinded its fee. But the creeping
surcharge hasn't been nipped altogether. American Express, which
issues its own cards, upped its foreign exchange fee from 1 percent
to 2 percent in April.
</P>
<P>
   Happily for consumers, the surcharge isn't across the board yet.
Wells Fargo and Bank of America do not charge a separate fee. Their
customers still pay just the 1 percent fee charged by Visa and
MasterCard.
</P>
<P>
   Your best strategy: Make a quick phone call to your credit card
issuer to find out whether your card has a surcharge and, if so,
how much. Then decide whether it makes sense to use that card at
all.
</P>
<P>
   To get the most out of your vacation dollars, experts say,
consumers should use all the tools in their financial toolbox _
credit cards from different issuers, ATM cards, cash and traveler's
checks, since each is superior in certain circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``People spend a lot of time planning what they want to see and
researching hotel and airfare costs,'' said Michael Estill,
executive director of the Western Association of Travel Agents.
``You should have a plan on how you're going to handle your money,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   He and other industry experts &UR;  &LR; offer this advice:
</P>
<P>
   _Get enough cash before leaving the United States to cover
initial expenses so you're not at the mercy of the first exchange
bureau you see. Exchange rates and fees vary widely. For example, a
traveler changing $1,000 into British currency last Friday, could
get 600 pounds at money-changer AFEX in downtown San Francisco but
only 570 pounds at the Travelex America kiosk at San Francisco
International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   _Carry some traveler's checks with you. The California State
Automobile Association and many banks will issue travelers checks,
to members or customers, without the usual 1 percent fee. In
general, the dollar's strength means it's been better to carry
dollar-denominated traveler's checks than those issued in a foreign
currency.
</P>
<P>
   _Find out if your ATM card can be used in foreign cash machines
to access cash in your bank account. Many can.
</P>
<P>
   ATM cards carrying the Visa logo, for example, can be used at
some 457,000 ATMs in 120 countries. Cards with the MasterCard logo
are good at 463,000 ATMs globally.
</P>
<P>
   Be forewarned: Four-digit PINs are standard in most countries.
If you have an alphabetic PIN with more than four digits, you may
need to get a new personal identification number.
</P>
<P>
   Check out pertinent ``ATM locator'' services before leaving home
so you can find the ATMs closest to your hotel or travel route.
Both Visa and MasterCard have excellent Web sites with ``ATM
Locator'' services. The MasterCard site ( &LR; www.master &LR;   &LR; card.com &LR; )
has details on the Cirrus network of financial institutions and the
Visa site ( &LR; www.visa.com &LR; ) lists Plus network locations.
</P>
<P>
   _Charge major purchases to your credit card, if you are carrying
a surcharge-free card. The exchange rate is set by Visa or
MasterCard and is close to the wholesale interbank rate. In
addition, you automatically get protections like arbitration of
disputes with retailers or hotels and protection against theft.
</P>
<P>
   _Use your ATM card to get money rather than to tap the ``cash
advance'' feature of your credit card which often carry higher
fees.
</P>
<P>
   Citibank customers using an ATM card to get cash in London, for
example, pay a fee of $1 to $1.50 per withdrawal. If they use their
Citibank credit card, they pay a minimum fee of $5 or 3 percent of
the transaction amount, whichever is greater. That means it costs
four times as much in fees to withdraw $200 using a credit card
than an ATM card.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think credit card cash advances should be used as more of
an emergency measure than as a way of paying for travel expenses,''
said Citibank's Menzler.
</P>
<P>
   For American Express customers, the cash advance fee is 2
percent of the transaction amount, with a minimum fee of $2.50 and
a maximum fee of $20.
</P>
<P>
   _One final complexity for many travelers concerns collision and
theft insurance on rental cars. Your personal policy won't cover
you abroad, in most cases. Find out whether the car you plan to
charge to your credit card automatically receives protection
through your credit card issuer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell all my customers, call and check the coverages before
you leave,'' said Donna Ludlum, co-owner of Little World Travel in
Belmont. ``It's always changing. I have a group in Europe now and
they were covered in Italy but not in Sicily.''
</P>
<P>
   It varies from country to country and card to card. For example,
Visa International no longer offers automatic insurance coverage to
cardholders renting cars in Ireland, Israel or Jamaica. But
MasterCard and Diners Club still offer this protection.
</P>
<P>
   None of the card companies offers protection for cars rented in
Australia or New Zealand. You'll have to buy coverage from the auto
rental company when you rent the car, often from $10 to $15 per
day.
</P>
<P>
   One last bit of advice from Scott Pinheiro of Santa Cruz Travel:
``If you're flying out of SFO, get there at least 45 minutes
earlier than usual because of traffic tie-ups caused by
construction of the new international terminal.''

 COMPENSATION _ SF CHRON  
 Bay Area Executives Score Big With Generous Stock Options  &HT;     By Arthur M. Louis 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Northern California's corporate executives got more of everything
last year: more salary, more bonuses and more stock options _
especially more stock options.
<P>
   In this era of soaring stock prices, cash compensation has
become little more than an afterthought for the region's
executives.
</P>
<P>
   They much prefer to be paid in stock _ and understandably so.
The profusion of new and larger option grants, compounded by the
magic of a stock market that just won't quit, has made many of them
fabulously wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 291 high-ranking executives from 54 large companies
included in The Chronicle's 15th annual executive-compensation
survey, 86 percent received stock-option grants last year with an
estimated total value of $1.05 billion.
</P>
<P>
   That was 43 percent more than the $733 million worth of options
granted to 293 executives in our year-earlier survey.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, nonoption compensation _ salaries, bonuses and
long-term incentive pay such as restricted stock _ totaled just
$338 million for the executives in the latest survey. That
represented a 26 percent gain from the amount the same executives
received in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Options now constitute three-fourths of executive pay, up from
less than one-third as recently as 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The largest option grant of all went to Margaret C. Whitman,
president and chief executive of eBay, the San Jose Internet
auction site.
</P>
<P>
   A former toy-company executive who joined then-private eBay
early last year, Whitman was granted options valued by the company
at $69.9 million, or $22 million more than eBay's 1998 revenues.
She was the only executive whose pay exceeded corporate revenues.
</P>
<P>
   After the grant was made, it became glaringly obvious that the
company's valuation of the options was ridiculously conservative.
Thanks to eBay's spectacular stock-market performance following an
initial public offering in September, the shares awarded to Whitman
currently are worth more than $1 billion!
</P>
<P>
   Pretty good for a year's work.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Pursglove, a spokesman for eBay, said nobody at the
company, including Whitman, ``had any idea'' that the stock would
do so well.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman ranked well up among the most overpaid executives in
Northern California last year, based on two objective tests.
</P>
<P>
   Her total compensation _ option grants plus nonoption pay _ was
the highest in proportion to company revenues, even using the
ultraconservative $69.9 million value placed on her option grant.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, her total compensation was equal to more than
one-third of 1 percent of her company's puffed-up $20 billion
market value. By that measure, she was the seventh highest-paid
among 61 CEOs.
</P>
<P>
   (The CEOs in the survey outnumbered the companies because two
companies have co-CEOS and five others changed CEOs during 1998.)
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the scale, the most modestly paid executive
by any reckoning was Steve Jobs, co-founder and interim CEO of
Apple Computer, who accepted a token $1 salary and no stock options
last year. No other executive in the survey received less than
$121,000 in total compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Huge, untapped stock-market fortunes are piling up for many
Northern California executives. At the end of last year, the
executives in the survey had $7 billion in paper profits from
unexercised options _ an average of close to $25 million per
executive.
</P>
<P>
   That is about twice the average amount of paper profits held by
the executives in the previous year's survey.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen executives were sitting on unexercised option profits of
$100 million or more at the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   At the top of the heap was Millard S. Drexler, the always
lavishly paid president and chief executive of Gap Inc., the San
Francisco apparel retailer.
</P>
<P>
   Drexler got new option grants valued at $39 million last year,
and by the end of the year, the profits on all his unexercised
options amounted to a staggering $659 million _ not bad for a
nonfounder who has been with the company for just 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   However, as Gap's proxy statement points out, the company's
stock increased an incredible 300-fold during those 15 years, and
Drexler's ``decisive management of operational and strategic
issues'' contributed mightily to the climb.
</P>
<P>
   Gap officials declined a request for further comment.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Ward, a compensation specialist with WestWard Pay
Strategies in San Francisco, notes that Gap's founding family,
headed by current company Chairman Donald G. Fisher, has cheerfully
handed Drexler enormous amounts of stock year after year.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the founders don't mind, most likely the other
shareholders won't mind either,'' Ward remarks. ``Clearly the
numbers are mind boggling, but it's hard to point to him as an
example of too much. Few individuals have done a better job in the
world of business.''
</P>
<P>
   Another prominent compensation expert begs to differ with that
analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Graef ``Bud'' Crystal, a former compensation consultant who
publishes the Crystal Report in Santa Rosa, contends that Drexler
is ``wildly overpaid.'' In his characteristically acerbic way, he
complains that Drexler has received ``monstrously sized option
grants that have to be hauled in by 18-wheelers.''
</P>
<P>
   Crystal said Drexler's compensation is particularly hard to
justify when contrasted with the amount paid to ``the average
employee of the Gap, who doesn't make much more than the minimum
wage. It's not like Intel, where the average employee is paid quite
a bit of money.''
</P>
<P>
   Ranking after Drexler in paper profits was Timothy Koogle,
president and chief executive of Yahoo, the Santa Clara Internet
software company, who has amassed $544 million in unexercised
option profits.
</P>
<P>
   Like Gap, Yahoo has enjoyed phenomenal stock-market growth,
ranking first in that category last year among all the companies in
the latest Chronicle 500 survey.
</P>
<P>
   Three other Yahoo executives also were among the Top 10 in paper
profits: Senior Vice President Farzad Nazem, with $316 million
worth; Chief Operating Office Jeffrey Mallett, with $245 million;
and Chief Financial Officer Gary Valenzuela, with $146 million.
</P>
<P>
   Marty Katz, a compensation specialist with William M. Mercer in
San Francisco, said he worries about what will happen to executive
compensation when what he calls the stock-market ``joy ride'' comes
to an end.
</P>
<P>
   He says that some executives who are riding high now could
actually find themselves inadequately compensated during a bear
market, because of the overwhelming emphasis on options.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies that are forward-thinking will reduce their emphasis
on stock options and increase their emphasis on long-term incentive
pay based on improving profit margins and cash flow,'' Katz
remarks. ``That will allow them to reward executives for doing the
right thing, disconnected from stock prices.''
</P>
<P>
   While the hottest compensation action took place on the option
front, nonoption pay also moved up strongly last year.
</P>
<P>
   The median salary for all the executives in The Chronicle survey
rose 19 percent to $343,743, while the median bonus _ for the more
than 80 percent of executives who got a bonus _ increased 11
percent to $247,139.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-two percent of the executives in the survey received at
least $1 million in nonoption compensation last year, compared with
29 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Hazen, chairman of Wells Fargo, the San Francisco banking
giant, led all other executives in nonoption compensation. He got a
total of $14.8 million, including $10.8 million worth of restricted
stock.
</P>
<P>
   Restricted stock also accounted for the bulk of the pay received
by the No. 2 executive on the nonoption list _ Harold M. Messmer
Jr., chairman and CEO of Robert Half International, the Menlo Park
employment agency. Messmer got $11.3 million, of which $8.8 million
was restricted stock.
</P>
<P>
   The Wells Fargo proxy statement indicates that most of Hazen's
restricted stock was awarded on November 2 _ the effective date of
the Wells Fargo merger with Norwest _ ``pursuant to Mr. Hazen's
employment agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Hazen had served as chairman and CEO of the old Wells Fargo, but
was replaced as CEO by Richard M. Kovacevich, who headed Norwest.
</P>
<P>
   The proxy is unclear on the subject, but seems to suggest either
that Hazen got the restricted stock as a reward for helping to sell
the company, or as a consolation prize for surrendering the CEO
title.
</P>
<P>
   Wells officials declined to elaborate on the proxy.
</P>
<P>
   Restricted stock is a special _ and controversial _ form of
deferred compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Companies offer the stock as an outright gift, although the
executive cannot take full possession until several years have
passed. Executives who leave their companies before the waiting
period ends usually must forfeit restricted shares.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-six executives in The Chronicle survey got
restricted-stock grants last year _ up from 39 the year before. The
size of the median grant rose a steep 55 percent to $860,689.
</P>
<P>
   Compensation consultants who are willing to wink at the huge
bonuses and option grants routinely lavished on corporate
executives find restricted stock hard to tolerate. They deride it
as ``pay for attendance,'' because it isn't keyed to performance;
an executive merely has to report to work each day until the
restricted stock becomes vested.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to keep entitlements like restricted stock from
infecting the overall pay package,'' said Matt Ward. ``But we're
seeing more restricted stock. It is disturbing.''

 Disney May Buy Remainder of Infoseek  &HT;     By Jon Swartz 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Walt Disney Co. said it is in ``serious talks'' with Infoseek Corp.
to gobble the 57 percent of the Internet company it doesn't already
own.
<P>
   In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing yesterday, the
entertainment giant said it may acquire the remainder of Infoseek's
shares _ worth about $1.53 billion, based on yesterday's closing
price. Infoseek shareholders would receive special Disney stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you reach a serious enough point, you need to disclose
this type of news,'' said Steve Wadsworth, president of Buena Vista
Internet Group, Disney's online arm. ``Nothing's definitive yet,
but talks have gone far.''
</P>
<P>
   Wadsworth stressed that Disney had not reached a final decision
on whether to proceed with such a plan, which would be subject to
the approval of the boards and the shareholders of both companies.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Disney's move has been expected since it bought 43
percent of Sunnyvale's Infoseek last fall for $860 million.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the companies rolled out GO Network, which combines
Infoseek and Disney-owned properties _ including ESPN.com, ABC.com,
Mr. Showbiz and Disney.com _ into a single site to compete with
Yahoo, Excite and other portals.
</P>
<P>
   Infoseek is spending an undisclosed amount on TV ads over the
next four months to promote GO Network.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goals of these discussions, which are far from complete,
extend the vision of our strategic relationship with Disney,''
Infoseek Chief Executive Officer Harry Motro said in a press
release yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   The move comes at a time when television networks are racing to
buy or partner with online companies. These ventures promote the
network's shows and peddle TV-related merchandise online, and
promote the Web site on TV ads.
</P>
<P>
   For example, NBC struck a deal with San Francisco Internet
company Xoom.com, and USA Networks attempted to buy Lycos of
Waltham, Mass., but the deal fell through.
</P>
<P>
   News of the potential Infoseek deal sent its shares soaring
$6.31, or 17.2 percent, to $43 in heavy trading. Disney shares
inched up 25 cents, to $30.88.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's move coincided with the resignation yesterday of Jake
Winebaum, chairman of Buena Vista Internet Group.
</P>
<P>
   Winebaum, who was instrumental in developing GO Network, will
start a new Internet venture firm with Sky Dayton, chairman of
Internet service provider EarthLink Network Inc. Disney and
EarthLink are making undisclosed investments in Winebaum's new
venture, eCompanies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jake was instrumental in getting GO Network up and running and
setting its infrastructure in place,'' he said. ``Given today's
announcement, the timing seems appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Wadsworth declined to comment on whether Disney might shift
online operations to the Bay Area after acquiring all of Infoseek,
or move Infoseek's headquarters to Burbank.

UNIVERSITY OFFICIALS YIELD TO STUDENT STRIKE IN MEXICO 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JULIA PRESTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ After seven weeks of a grueling student strike at
the National Autonomous University of Mexico, the largest
institution of higher education in Latin America, the
administration on Monday backed down before the students' protests,
opening the way for a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The strike, the longest in the university's 89-year history,
halted the studies of 270,000 students. The strikers shut down
classes on April 20 to protest an attempt by the president,
Francisco Barnes de Castro, to make students who could afford it
pay tuition.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the governing council of the university, a 132-member
body that includes both faculty and students, approved a proposal
offered by a weary Barnes to establish new tuition fees but make
them voluntary.
</P>
<P>
   After weeks of stalemate when the two sides were not even
talking, Barnes was forced to yield to the strikers' determination
to preserve the principle of free public education at the
university, which is known by its Spanish initials as the UNAM.
</P>
<P>
   The strike grew more intractable as it dragged on and turned
into a battle for the soul of the university. The strikers want it
to remain a place for the masses, where all kinds of young Mexicans
can get at least a little bit of college education. The
administration, much of the faculty and some students hoped to make
it more selective and shift the curriculum toward practical
preparation for the increasingly tight and specialized job market
in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   In February, the governing council had voted a tuition code
proposed by Barnes that called for students with some economic
means to pay about $150 a year. Needy students would not have to
pay.
</P>
<P>
   Since the university's tuition scales have not been readjusted
for inflation and currency fluctuations since 1948, the current fee
is equivalent to about 2 American pennies a year.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government now pays 90 percent of the $1 billion
annual budget. Barnes said that the new tuition fees could raise
$84 million, or about 8 percent of that figure.
</P>
<P>
   The university, whose vast campus is a teeming city within
Mexico City, is seminal to Mexican life. Several recent presidents
either studied or taught there. Leading intellectuals consider it a
nationalist duty to serve on its faculty. The UNAM was the
birthplace of the student movement of 1968, which turned into a
nationwide rebellion against autocratic rule and started Mexico on
a three-decade odyssey toward democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes wanted the extra funds to stop a steep decline in the
UNAM's academic performance. Once a flagship in Hispanic America,
it now struggles with poorly paid teachers, dwindling funds for
research, huge numbers of absent or failing students and outmoded
facilities.
</P>
<P>
   The students' strike divided public opinion. The dispute was
polarized in the first week when a student, Martha Alejandra
Trigueros Cruz, was run over and killed by a bus during a street
protest.
</P>
<P>
   The strikers drew big crowds to marches in the capital and
gathered enough support to shut down all activities on campus
except basic research although thousands of students quietly
continued their courses in makeshift off-campus classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   At the outset Barnes had sworn that he would not give in to
``the abuse'' of the strike ``no matter what pressures or threats
we face.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday he conceded that he had run into a political wall.
Barnes is the third UNAM president since 1987 to go down in defeat
in attempting to charge fees and tighten standards at the UNAM.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether or not to pay tuition will be a matter for each
student's conscience,'' Barnes said, ``and not an obligation
imposed by someone else's decision.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Some strikers were belligerent. They brawled with students who
attended off-campus classes and violently closed down some of the
classrooms. The administration took out seven arrest warrants
against strikers accused of stealing computers, earthquake
monitoring equipment and university vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Student leaders said they had to strike to keep the university
open to rich and poor Mexicans and preserve its liberal arts
design. They accused Barnes of trying to transform it into a
white-collar vocational school by scaling back disciplines like
philosophy and political science in favor of nuts-and-bolts courses
in computers, economics, accounting and science.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want a university that just serves private
companies,'' said Mauricio Cruz, 18, a striking student at one of
the preparatory high schools that are part of the UNAM system. ``We
want it to be at the service of society.''
</P>
<P>
   The strikers also resisted the administration's drive to impose
tougher examinations, time limits and other requirements for
graduation. Many Mexicans lost patience with that part of the
students' demands. Echoing the society, the press turned against
the strikers, and they came across in the media as an intransigent
minority among students who by and large were willing to pay
tuition and study more.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in general are opposed to this strike,'' said Carlos
Ornelas, a professor of education at another public university in
Mexico City. ``Mexicans no longer automatically swallow what the
government says, but they also don't accept anti-government

 _ SF CHRON  
 Regulator Warns Banks, Credit Card Issuers  &HT;     By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
A top U.S. bank regulator yesterday warned banks and credit card
issuers to halt misleading sales pitches and other anti-consumer
practices or face a crackdown from federal watchdogs.
<P>
   Comptroller of the Currency John Hawke, speaking at an industry
conference in San Francisco, said banks increasingly are turning to
business methods that harm consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's mounting evidence of an increase in banking practices
that are at least seamy, if not downright unfair and deceptive _
practices that virtually cry out for government scrutiny,'' Hawke
said.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, Hawke slammed lenders who fail to report payment
histories to credit bureaus, thereby depriving customers of chances
to fix flawed credit records. He also cited lenders who sell
financial information about customers to outside vendors that use
trickery to sell products over the telephone.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something that exploded on us,'' Hawke said in an
interview before his speech. An agency hotline installed last year
as a service to consumers is logging complaints at the rate of
100,000 a year, he noted.
</P>
<P>
   Hawke said anti-consumer practices are a red flag inviting
lawmakers to toughen laws protecting bank customers, perhaps as
part of banking legislation currently before Congress. ``Where
there are consumer abuses unremedied by industry, Congress has
invariably stepped in,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Locally, reports that the San Francisco district attorney's
office is investigating possible consumer fraud by Providian
Financial Corp., the nation's ninth-largest credit card issuer, has
focused attention on alleged deceptive sales practices by lenders.
</P>
<P>
   Providian allegedly used deceptive tactics to sell add-on
products such as credit protection.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Hawke, whose agency regulates nationally chartered banks,
declined to comment on Providian.
</P>
<P>
   But he said angry customers ultimately could affect a bank's
financial health by withdrawing business and filing lawsuits. That
danger, he stressed, makes anti-consumer practices a legitimate
concern for bank regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, bank examiners only considered whether lenders
formally obeyed the law by, for example, disclosing interest rates.
Now, Hawke said, his agency is considering whether to examine
broader problems that are harder to pin down, such as telemarketing
abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the comptroller said in his speech, ``shoddy and
unethical practices, marketing schemes that overreach or exploit,
and offensive sales techniques'' may not actually be against the
law.
</P>
<P>
   Hawke, a longtime Washington lawyer and former Under Secretary
of the Treasury for Domestic Finance before President Clinton named
him comptroller late last year. Consumer groups and some liberal
democrats opposed his appointment because of disagreements over
such issues as the need for customer protections in electronic
banking.
</P>
<P>
   The number of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency's
consumer telephone hotline is (800) 613-6743.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ When Andre Levy-Lang, the chief executive of Paribas,
runs into Claude Bebear these days, he asks him whether he has made
up his mind.
</P>
<P>
   Bebear, chairman of the big French insurer AXA SA, is not only a
shareholder of Paribas but also of Banque Nationale de Paris, whose
hostile bid for Paribas and Societe Generale is threatening to turn
the proposed merger of these two French banks into a three-way
dance.
</P>
<P>
   So later this month, when big institutional investors that own
chunks of Paribas and Societe Generale decide whether to sell their
shares to Banque Nationale, they will be watching Bebear, one of
the most powerful kingmakers in French finance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I meet Bebear often, and he says he's open-minded, not
decided,'' Levy-Lang said in an interview. Yet to be on the safe
side, Levy-Lang and Daniel Bouton, his counterpart at Societe
Generale, have asked a Paris court to declare the Banque Nationale
bid invalid. A decision is expected June 17.
</P>
<P>
   Banque Nationale's proposed $37 billion share swap for Paribas
and Societe Generale is the latest turn of European banking's
merger carousel. If it succeeds _ and a final decision could come
by June 30 _ it would create a group with $1 trillion in assets,
eclipsing UBS of Switzerland as the world's largest bank.
</P>
<P>
   Owners of Paribas shares may sell them to Societe Generale or to
Banque Nationale, or hold onto them; investors in Societe Generale
must decide whether to tender their shares to Banque Nationale.
</P>
<P>
   Investors have been lukewarm toward both proposals, weakening
the share prices of Banque Nationale and Societe Generale. Paribas,
by contrast, has gained slightly.
</P>
<P>
   Bebear has not been commenting, but if anything he has expressed
in the past a preference for the larger combination.
</P>
<P>
   On one level, the battle has turned into a clash of banking
titans. Should the three-way merger come about, the future of
Levy-Lang and Bouton would be at risk; if it fails, Banque
Nationale's chief, Michel Pebereau, would be isolated.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the personal maneuvering, larger stakes are at risk.
</P>
<P>
   In July, the Socialist government of Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin will sell its stake in Credit Lyonnais, the nationalized
bank that has lost billions. The largest share, about 10 percent,
will go to Credit Agricole, which is not only France's biggest
retail bank, with 22 percent of the market, but also stands in the
front line of potential cross-border alliances, because of its 23
percent stake in Banca Intesa, one of Italy's largest banks.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Banca Intesa is expected to announce a merger with
Banca Commerciale Italiana to create a big new Italian banking
group. Credit Agricole would retain a 13 percent share in such a
combination.
</P>
<P>
   Baudoin Prot, the No. 2 executive at Banque Nationale, said the
rationale for his bank's proposal was easy to explain.
</P>
<P>
   Pointing to a chart ranking European banks by market
capitalization, he noted in an interview that Paribas' proposed
two-way combination with Societe Generale would rank 14th in
Europe; the three-way combination would be fifth. Without the
larger combination, he said, ``all three would be at the bottom of
the European league; they will be marginalized.''
</P>
<P>
   Each side has frequently been sending senior executives on road
shows to try to woo investors. Moreover, a white knight could enter
the scene to rescue Paribas and Societe Generale from the grip of
Banque Nationale. Recently, Banco Santander Central Hispano of
Spain refused to comment on reports that it was a potential
rescuer, but analysts discounted Santander, itself the result of a
recent merger of two of Spain's largest banks.
</P>
<P>
   Aligning Paribas with Societe Generale, which are roughly the
same size in terms of market capitalization, would certainly bring
benefits. Levy-Lang says the two banks can save $3 billion pretax
over three years by merging back-office functions and services like
computer technology. Both Paribas and Societe Generale emphasize
how they complement each other, given Societe Generale's strength
in retail banking and Paribas' focus on investment banking.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Levy-Lang cites analysts who say that European bank
consolidation will put pressure on retail banking profits, making
wholesale banking's profit potential appear more attractive. And
the institution created by the two-way link, he says, would have
half its equity in wholesale banking operations.
</P>
<P>
   If there is investor sympathy for the three-way deal, it lies in
part in the potential threat to a smaller solution posed by the
entry of Credit Agricole into the Credit Lyonnais shareholder
group.
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Michel Cornudet, the spokesman for Credit Agricole, says
his bank wants to parlay its stake into a long-term partnership
with Lyonnais and has proposed more than a half-dozen areas of
potential cooperation, including consumer credit, leasing,
factoring and asset management. Together, Credit Agricole and
Lyonnais would have more than $200 billion of assets under
management. `'Once privatization is done in July, we can begin
talking about project implementation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Credit Lyonnais will not comment on its future alliance plans,
and at any rate under the terms of its privatization none are
allowed for two years.
</P>
<P>
   Cornudet acknowledges that the biggest uncertainties in Credit
Agricole's future with Credit Lyonnais involve questions of control
of any banking combination and the possibility of other more
attractive alliances for Lyonnais. But if the three-way merger
around Banque Nationale succeeds, few domestic French alternatives
would remain for Lyonnais. He added, however, that ``partnerships
can only live in the long term if they are desired by both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   One analyst, John Leonard of Salomon Smith Barney, said he
thought Banque Nationale's chances of success ``have marginally
increased'' recently given the lack of success of the target banks
in persuading French stock market regulators to invalidate the
hostile bid.
</P>
<P>
   The worst outcome, he said, would be if Paribas shareholders
opted to sell their shares to Banque Nationale, but Societe
Generale stock owners refrained, leaving a stalemate in which
Banque Nationale wound up with Paribas but not Societe Generale.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody hopes for that,'' Leonard said.

 Microsoft Officially Launches Office 2000  &HT;     By Benny Evangelista 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
On the same day a new report said Microsoft is winning the browser
war, the software giant demonstrated how Office 2000 will extend
its reach into the Internet.
<P>
   At a launch party for Office 2000 in downtown San Francisco,
Microsoft President Steve Ballmer showed how the upgrade to the
widely used Office 97 software package weaves the Internet into
business memos, spreadsheets, e-mail and PowerPoint presentations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're integrating the best of Web technology with the best of
Office technology,'' Ballmer said as he formally launched Office
2000 before about 600 guests at the Sony-Imax Theater in the new
Metreon center.
</P>
<P>
   Office 2000, which includes word processing, e-mail and other
business productivity software, goes on sale at retailers on
Thursday. It replaces Office 97, which has about 100 million users
and most of the business productivity software market.
</P>
<P>
   Corporations and computer-makers have already bought 15 million
copies of Office 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Office 2000 should only increase Microsoft's lead in the browser
market. Yesterday, InfoBeads, a Ziff-Davis research group, reported
that in January, there were 33.8 million U.S. PCs using Microsoft's
Internet Explorer compared to only 32 million for Netscape's
browsers. This was the first time Netscape, which only last year
had 54 percent of the market, had surrendered the lead to
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft included Internet Explorer with its Windows operating
system, which runs about 90 percent of the world's desktop PCs.
Microsoft has denied charges by the federal government and 19
states that the Redmond, Wash., firm used its monopoly position to
gain an unfair advantage over competing browsers including
Netscape's.
</P>
<P>
   Office 2000 integrates the basic language of the Web, HTML, into
each of its programs, including Word, Outlook and PowerPoint, and
is designed to let computer users share documents on the Web the
same way they might on a corporate network.
</P>
<P>
   For example, workers in one office could post a memo on a Web
site and it could be reviewed or changed by workers in other
offices. The product is designed for companies that don't have
internal networks, or who want to share documents with people in
other firms. However, Ballmer said certain features will work only
with Internet Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   Ballmer also announced partnerships between Microsoft and two
major Internet service providers _ Concentric Network Inc. of San
Jose and Verio Inc. of Colorado _ to offer new Web-based business
services for small and medium-size firms.
</P>
<P>
   Also during the launch party, Ballmer denied rumors that
Microsoft planned to make an Office 2000 version for Linux, an
alternative computer operating system that is gaining grassroots
popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the Metreon, San Francisco police ordered two Linux
supporters, one dressed as a big penguin, away from the launch
party entrance as they tried to hand out flyers about Penguin
Computing's Linux products.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft and the evil empire decided that we were somehow a
threat to them,'' said Justin Cheung, a Penguin Computing employee.

SLOW GOING ON THE ROAD  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 13)

<P>
   There's a traffic jam in the Spaghetti Bowl. This tangle of
highways at Las Vegas, including Interstate 15, which carries
traffic to and from California, and U.S. Route 95, is being redone
at a cost of $92 million in what Scott Magruder, a Department of
Transportation spokesman, says is Nevada's most costly road
project. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This choke point is one of 12 on major arteries that the AAA,
based in Heathrow, Fla., says will affect motorists on vacation
trips this summer. Families getting organized should be aware that
roads with easy daytime flow may be home to bright lights and
construction crews at night.
</P>
<P>
   As the interstate system moves along in its middle age, state
transportation agencies try to make the repairs outside major
travel hours. If you are running late, particularly if you like to
drive while the children sleep in back, you may meet unexpected
stoppages. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here are brief reports on a few major road-work sites. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Since Las Vegas is pressing Orlando as the most popular
destination in the United States, the Spaghetti Bowl road work,
which will eventually increase Las Vegas-California traffic to
three lanes in each direction from two, is more than a blip on the
traffic radar.
</P>
<P>
   Magruder said that eight major ramps on the vintage-60s highways
were being redone, with only two finished so far. The overhaul is a
three-year project, and it is half done. Signs overhead warn
travelers of what is coming at the Spaghetti Bowl. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Right now the construction means that drivers arriving from
California _ those coming from the airport south of town will miss
the mess _ should allow an extra 10 or 15 minutes. The situation is
easier on weekends, Magruder said, and construction ceases on
holiday weekends _ a precaution taken after New Year's, when
traffic into California backed up from the state line 36 miles into
downtown Las Vegas. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Information about this work can be found at www.nevadadot.com,
the state highway Web site. Magruder said that despite the
difficulties, the Interstate was still the way to travel into Las
Vegas, since drivers should not miss the night trip along the
Strip. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yellowstone  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Road repairs in and east of Yellowstone Park in Wyoming continue
to slow visitors. Families with Yellowstone in their plans for
summer should get up-to-date information before setting out; cars
arriving late in the evening could find the East Entrance blocked. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A stretch of eight miles in the center of the 50-mile route from
Cody to the East Entrance on U.S. Routes 14, 16 and 20 is under
repair. This section, between mileposts 27 and 19, includes
bridges, and there is no alternative route. Kerry Lang of the
Yellowstone Park administration says that drivers should allow an
extra half hour for the Cody-East Entrance trip. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Inside the park, she said, where road work continues between the
entrance and Fishing Bridge, extra time, probably another half
hour, should be budgeted. Farther west, the road along Yellowstone
Lake between Fishing Bridge and West Thumb will probably be closed
at night starting June 15, and delays of 30 minutes at other times
are likely. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After July 6, the East Entrance will be closed at 9 p.m., and
there will be warning signs in Cody. Mrs. Lang urges those making
plans to call (307) 344-2109 well in advance to get maps and other
information, and (307) 344-7381 to learn the latest conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Although the National Park Service Web site, www.nps.gov, said
it was having technical problems at the end of May, and most links
were not working, I had no difficulty starting out with
www.nps.gov/yell, where ``maps and orientation'' offers a link to
construction reports. &QL;

   Connecticut &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The state is working almost continuously on its frayed
interstates, according to Sue Reynolds of its Department of
Transportation. But work is being conducted without shutting down
lanes for long periods of time, she said. This is done by narrowing
the lanes and rerouting traffic onto breakdown lanes. Most work
goes on at night, or in daylight hours between the morning and
evening rush periods. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I-95 in Greenwich will be worked on all summer between 8 p.m.
and 6 a.m., Monday to Friday, Ms. Reynolds said. At Exits 8 to 10
in Stamford, there will also be night work, as there will be from
Exits 26 to 29 in Bridgeport, where there are extensive ramp
projects under way. In Stratford and Milford, the I-95 work will go
on between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m., as it will on the Merritt, or Route
15, in Stratford and Trumbull. I-84 in West Hartford will be worked
on at night. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``On weekends and holidays, we just stop work, so as to speed
people through the state,'' Ms. Reynolds said.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Radio advisories for drivers on I-95 are expected to be
broadcast on 520 AM frequency starting July 1. When this was being
tested, entertaining quizzes on safety and other stay-alert items
were included, and they are to continue. One of these was:
``Without looking in your rear-view mirror, do you know what color
the car behind you is?''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The AAA says it is hearing from motorists most about a project
in Cincinnati, where I-71, which bears a major traffic load from
Cleveland on Lake Erie southwest to Louisville, Ky., where it
debouches into I-64 and I-65. At Cincinnati, this highway crosses
the Ohio River into Covington, Ky. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The work focuses on a one-mile stretch in Cincinnati called the
Fort Washington Way. As befits a major star among road projects,
this one has its own Web site, www.fww2000 .com. It shows detour
maps and is brought up to date daily by the construction company,
Parsons Brinkerhoff. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Julie Harrison, an information officer for the project, said
that the old four-lane road was carrying 150,000 cars a day _
almost triple its intended capacity. Now, with the slowdown, and
with westbound traffic routed off the roadway, eastbound traffic is
down to 50,000 a day. probably because local eastbound drivers are
using alternate routes.
</P>
<P>
   The suggested westbound detour is four and a half miles long to
get around the one-mile blockage. It leads through traffic to
I-275, rather than through local streets. There are many signs for
guidance, Ms. Harrison says. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Traffic Information &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Smartraveler Web site, www .smartraveler.com (note: just one
``t''), has been adding to its databases steadily since it got
Massachusetts on line in 1996. It now has travel information about
Boston, Chicago, Cincinnati, Los Angeles, Milwaukee,
Minneapolis-St. Paul, New York, Philadelphia, San Diego, San
Francisco and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Users can click on the medallion for the route number and get
information about construction and how fast traffic is moving.
Transit information is also sometimes available. Stacey Kevorkian
of Smart Route Systems, the organizer of this project, says that
the San Francisco link will be augmented, and the company hopes to
have Denver on line before the ski season begins, with Los Angeles
and others due through 2000.

MORGAN STANLEY ACCUSES FORMER EMPLOYEE OF FALSE EXPENSE FILINGS
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Morgan Stanley Dean Witter has accused a former
employee who filed a discrimination suit against the firm of brazen
theft of the firm's money through systematic false expense filings,
and said that the employee's contentions of racism and homophobia
there amount to an ``extortion scheme.''
</P>
<P>
   The firm also defended a $10,000 payment it made to an informant
involved in a police undercover operation against the former
employee, calling it a ``reward'' made as a ``token of
appreciation'' for help in thwarting a crime. The firm said that
after the payment was made, the informant made ``vigorous and
extensive efforts to extort larger sums of money'' from the firm.
</P>
<P>
   The accusations are part of a 28-page response Morgan Stanley
made to a civil lawsuit filed against it by Christian L. Curry, the
former employee. The lawsuit seeks $1.35 billion in damages and
alleges multiple counts of racism, homophobia and false arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley lawyers said Curry, a graduate of Columbia
University who hails from a prominent New York family, was
dismissed solely for expense-account abuses. The abuses occurred on
a grand scale _ more than 150 separate false expense filings in 10
months, they said. The decision to dismiss Curry, who is black, had
already been made before photos of him appeared in a gay men's
magazine, the lawyers said, even though he was not actually
dismissed until shortly after the magazine appeared.
</P>
<P>
   ``This action is nothing more than a well-orchestrated extortion
scheme cloaked with a caption and docket number,'' the firm said in
answering Curry's lawsuit, which was filed last month. Paul, Weiss,
Rifkind, Wharton &AMP; Garrison, the law firm handling Morgan Stanley's
defense in the matter, filed the response on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The sharply worded response marks Morgan Stanley's most spirited
defense of its actions since the firm was caught in a whirlwind of
accusations about its conduct in the Curry case last month.
</P>
<P>
   Benedict P. Morelli, Curry's lawyer, has said that Morgan
Stanley's claim of expense account abuses is a cover for the real
reason for dismissing Curry, which he said was racism and
homophobia. Curry has said that he is not gay, but that his bosses
at the firm thought he was. Morelli did not return phone calls
seeking comment on Morgan Stanley's response Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The matter began a year ago when Morgan Stanley dismissed Curry
shortly after photos of him appeared in Playguy, a pornographic
magazine for gay men. Morgan Stanley has said that he was dismissed
for expense account abuses, but until now provided few details.
Last August, police arrested Curry and charged him with conspiring
to plant fake e-mails on the firm's computer system to bolster a
planned discrimination lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the Manhattan district attorney's office announced
that it was dropping charges against Curry. It also said that it
had begun an investigation into a $10,000 payment Morgan Stanley
made to Charles Joseph Luethke, a college friend of Curry who
played a key role in the police undercover operation. That
investigation is continuing.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley suspended with pay two inhouse lawyers in
connection with the $10,000 payment.
</P>
<P>
   In the response on Monday, the firm defended its ``reward'' to
Luethke for his help in preventing a crime. The firm said it had
legal advice from one of its outside law firms, Davis, Polk &AMP;
Wardwell, that such a reward payment is legal. It said that after
the payment, Luethke barraged the firm with calls and letters
seeking to ``extort'' more money from the firm.
</P>
<P>
   Luethke denied on Monday that he ever sought to extort money,
and contended that his discussions with the firm were attempts to
work out a legitimate business contract.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of the Morgan Stanley response details what it calls a
pattern of expense account abuses by Curry. It says, for example,
that he submitted vouchers seeking hundreds of dollars in
reimbursements for what he described as work-related meals with
colleagues, but that the colleagues denied dining with Curry on
those occasions.
</P>
<P>
   On numerous occasions Curry submitted phony expense claims for
meals that were in fact receipts from purchases of personal items.
After investigating, the firm found that Curry was claiming to have
dined at stores like Cole-Hahn, FAO Schwarz, Lots of Linens
furniture, House Aoxo electronics, Virgin Megastore, Blockbuster
Video, as well as movie theaters, liquor stores and photo labs.
</P>
<P>
   Fully half of the expense claims Curry made in his 10 months at
the firm were false, the lawyers said. Many of the violations were
discovered after Curry's dismissal, the lawyers acknowledge in
their filing. But it says that prior to Curry's termination, it had
already uncovered a pattern of expense account violations that was
``willful and brazenly premeditated, not a product of inadvertence
or carelessness.''
</P>
<P>
   The violation first came to Morgan Stanley's attention when
Curry submitted an expense claim from a Manhattan strip club called
Flash Dancers, and was denied reimbursement, the lawyers said.
Robert Weaver, one of Curry's bosses, then began examining his
expense records. He found that Curry systematically tore the
receipts he submitted to hide the name of the establishment, and
frequently _ at least 14 times _ named fellow employees he had
dined with who denied having dined with him.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers said that when Curry was confronted with evidence of
fraud, he tried to shift the blame to his secretary, who had
recently retired. Subsequently he acknowledged the abuses and asked
for a chance to resign. But he then retracted his offer to resign,
and the firm dismissed him, the lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   The firm also defended itself against allegations that it sought
to frame Curry for a crime he did not commit by paying a middleman
to set up his arrest. That claim is also contained in Curry's
lawsuit against the firm, and is one of the matters being
investigated by the district attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley said it did have contact with the New York Police
Department before Curry's arrest, but that it had nothing to do
with managing the undercover operation, as the lawsuit alleges.
</P>
<P>
   The firm also said that it has evidence that Curry approached an
employee of Morgan Stanley to help him execute his scheme to plant
fake e-mail messages there. Curry offered an employee that he knew
from Columbia University $100,000 to help him plant e-mails, the
lawyers said, but the employee declined to do so.

   Summer Garden Tours In Rhode Island &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to Rhode Island this summer will have a chance to tour
a variety of gardens, big and small, during the first annual
Gardens Open for Blithewold tour. The event, which benefits
Blithewold _ a 1908 mansion, garden and arboretum in Bristol _ s
scheduled for one day each month, from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., in June,
July and September. More than 30 private gardens in all (at least
10 a day) will be showcased.
</P>
<P>
   On June 26, the first segment, called the East Bay and
Providence Tour, will encompass Blithewold itself and a number of
in-town gardens. In Bristol, guests can inspect the formal gardens
of the artist Penelope Manzella, who incorporates sculpture among
her blooming trees, topiaries and roses overlooking the Warren
River.
</P>
<P>
   On July 24, the South County Tour will feature several gardens
created by Louis Raymond, who was the designer for this year's New
England Spring Flower Show in Boston. On view, for example, will be
the grounds of a 15-acre 1917 Shingle Style mansion in Matunuck,
which are planted with espaliered magnolias, rare evergreens,
bamboo and bottlebrush buckeye.
</P>
<P>
   The final Newport County Tour, on Sept. 25, takes in a garden
bordering a salt marsh and several seaside gardens, including a
rose-filled tract belonging to the former Rhode Island Sen.
Claiborne Pell and his wife, Nuala.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets ($30 for the day or $75 for the three-day series) are
sold in advance only. Information and reservations: (401) 253-2707.

   How Do You Say Rickshaw in French? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to Paris have a new way to tour the city: three-wheeled
black-and-yellow velo-taxis, or taxi-bikes. These rickshaws have
fiberglass passenger carriages and 21 gears. The 20 taxi-bikes,
operated by bilingual students, follow a three-mile circuit
beginning and ending at the Place de la Concorde. The trip lasts an
hour, and passes the Jardin des Tuileries, Place de l'Opera, Place
de la Madeleine, Place Vendome, the Louvre and the Musee d'Orsay.
Passengers can request stops for photographs.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was hatched by two brothers, Patrick and Didier
Leonhart, both veterans of the French Foreign Legion, as an
environmentally friendly and noiseless way to see Paris. Cost: $15;
$21 for two (a child under 2 can sit between two adults). The taxis
operate daily, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; (33-1) 47.42.00.01. &QL;

   Iberia, Beset by Delays, Cuts Flight Schedule &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Spain's state-run airline, Iberia, has scaled back plans to
expand its schedule in Europe and Latin America, canceling 900
flights, or 3.5 percent of its scheduled departures, in June. These
include suspension of service from Madrid to Moscow and to
London-Gatwick. The decision, announced in May, is an effort to
reduce delays at Spanish airports, especially in Madrid.
</P>
<P>
   A recent labor agreement between the pilots' union and Iberia
was seen as a step to ease the delays, which began in late March
and have been frequent front-page news in Spain. But Iberia said
the reduced June schedule was necessary because the situation was
still not back to normal.
</P>
<P>
   There have been numerous passenger complaints about extensively
delayed flights, and on the worst days this spring, more than 90
percent of the flights at Barajas Airport in Madrid were delayed by
at least 30 minutes and, in some cases, hours. The causes for the
delays, among the worst in Europe, are said to include a shortage
of several hundred air traffic controllers in Spain, a
restructuring of European air routes, the Iberia pilots' strike in
late March and early April, and the war in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Iberia, which said it lost $26 million because of the pilots'
strike, has had the most delays and canceled flights, followed by
Spain's two main private carriers, Spanair and Air Europa. Other
European and United States airlines operating in Spain have been
more punctual, relying where possible on their own ground crews. &QL;

   Mount Rainier Park Celebrating Centennial &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mount Rainier National Park, a pristine enclave of forests,
glaciers and alpine meadows surrounding the Pacific Northwest's
loftiest mountain, turns 100 this year. The centennial will be
commemorated with a series of activities, both inside and outside
the park. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When established on March 2, 1899, Mount Rainier, in Washington
State, became the nation's fifth national park, preceded only by
Yellowstone in 1872, and Yosemite, Sequoia and Kings Canyon, all in
1890. Ranging in elevation from 1,760 feet to the 14,410-foot
summit of Rainier _ a dormant volcano visible for 100 miles _ the
park has a remarkable variety of flora and fauna. It is
crisscrossed by 147 miles of roads and 240 miles of maintained
trails, and about two million people visit each year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The calendar of centennial events includes photography exhibits,
interpretive park programs, a one-day bike ride around Mount
Rainier, weekend festivals in communities surrounding the park, and
a 60-mile Summit-to-Sound Relay from the top of Rainier to the
Puget Sound by foot, bicycle, Rollerblade, horseback and kayak.
</P>
<P>
   To receive a calendar of events, call the park at (360)
569-2211, or visit the Web site at www.mtrainier100.com. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Washington State History Museum in Tacoma will mark the
centennial with an exhibition that examines the cultural and
natural history of the park through interactive displays,
historical photographs, artifacts and computer animation. Titled
``Sunrise to Paradise: The Story of Mount Rainier National Park,''
the exhibit will run through Jan. 9, 2000. The museum is at 1911
Pacific Avenue, Tacoma; (888) 238-4373. Admission is $7; free
Thursday evenings; open daily.

   Amsterdam's Van Gogh Museum Reopens &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A new and improved Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam will reopen on
June 24, 10 months after closing for renovations.
</P>
<P>
   The improved part is the original museum, which was expected to
attract 60,000 visitors a year when it opened in 1973, but was
drawing a million by 1997. Now renovated, it is devoted exclusively
to the museum's permanent collection _ the world's largest trove of
van Goghs (some 200 paintings, 500 drawings, 700 letters and his
Japanese prints collection) plus works by some contemporaries, like
Gauguin and Toulouse-Lautrec, and by older artists he admired, like
Millet.
</P>
<P>
   The new part is a wing designed by the Japanese architect Kisho
Kurokawa that will be used for special exhibits. The opening show,
``Theo van Gogh: Art Dealer, Collector and Brother of Vincent,''
covers the career of the artist's younger brother, who was born in
1857 and died in 1891, six months after Vincent committed suicide.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition demonstrates the financial and moral support Theo
offered Vincent and also documents his roles as an influential art
dealer in Paris in the 1880s and as a collector. Between 1881 and
1890, Theo was manager of Goupil &AMP; Cie's branch on Boulevard
Montmartre, from which he sold about 1,000 paintings, including
works by members of the Barbizon School like Corot and Daubigny.
Among the works in the show will be Corot's ``Artist's Studio'' and
Daubigny's ``House of Mere Bazot.''
</P>
<P>
   Theo also organized solo shows for Monet, Pissarro and
Raffaelli, lavished attention on Degas and Gauguin and sold works
by all of them. Highlights in the exhibition include Degas' ``Woman
Seated Beside a Vase of Flowers,'' Monet's ``Church at Vetheuil''
and Pissarro's ``Street in Auvers.''
</P>
<P>
   Theo's extraordinary bond with his brother is illustrated by a
group of paintings that were special to Theo, including ``Almond
Blossom.'' Letters, photographs and possessions of Theo end the
show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Theo van Gogh'' closes on Sept. 5, then moves to the Musee
d'Orsay in Paris, where it will be on view from Sept. 27 through
Jan. 9, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The Van Gogh Museum, at 7 Paulus Potterstraat, is open daily.
Admission: $6.25. Information: (31-20) 570-5252 or on the Web at
www.vangoghmuseum.nl. &QL;

   Lazard Freres to Integrate U.S. and European Units
</P>
<P>
   Lazard Freres, the boutique investment banking partnership,
plans to integrate its London, Paris and New York operations and to
shuffle its executive ranks in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The integration of Lazard's European and American operations,
long noted for proud individualism, seems intended in part to
compete with the fluid global networks of other investment banks.
As part of the overhaul, William R. Loomis Jr., 51, will replace
Steven Rattner, 47, as deputy chief executive and the firm's top
day-to-day executive in the United States. Rattner will remain with
the firm as vice chairman.

CLINTON ANNOUNCES MENTAL HEALTH INITIATIVES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton on Monday announced improved
mental health benefits for federal workers at a conference led by
the vice president's wife, who has acknowledged her struggle with
depression.
</P>
<P>
   The mental health conference at Howard University gave the
president a chance to announce new initiatives but also provided a
forum for Vice President Al Gore and his wife, Tipper, who are
gearing up for a presidential campaign. First lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton, considering a run for the Senate, also participated.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing experts and lawmakers, Clinton spoke both of the
advancements in treating mental illness and of the need for
businesses and government to give patients better access to
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   To remedy at least part of the problem, the president said, he
has issued a directive requiring the 285 health plans serving
federal employees to offer parity between physical and mental
health and substance abuse benefits by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   That means that those health plans cannot charge higher
co-payments or impose different coverage limits on mental health
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials estimate that such improved benefits would
increase premium costs by about 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said businesses should emulate the federal government on
mental health parity, because the cost will be greater if the
disease is ignored.
</P>
<P>
   ``Insurance plans claim providing parity for mental health will
send costs and premiums skyrocketing. Businesses believe employees
will overuse mental health services, making it impossible for
employers to offer health insurance,'' Clinton said. ``But I
believe that providing parity is something we can do at a
reasonable cost, benefit millions of Americans and over the long
run, have a healthier country and lower health care costs.''
</P>
<P>
   Interest in treating mental illness, long a taboo subject, has
risen in recent years. In 1996 Congress approved a prohibition on
health plans setting lower annual and lifetime limits for mental
health care than other medical service. And this year lawmakers of
both parties are proposing measures that mandate that insurers
provide parity in mental and physical benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-three states have mental health parity laws, although the
measures vary widely on who and what benefits are covered.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, mental health parity is required for state and local
governments, as a result of a 1991 law.
</P>
<P>
   But many businesses still do not provide mental health parity
benefits because of the cost. Even the National Mental Health
Association, which has been lobbying for the change, does not offer
parity in benefits, although a spokesman said the group is
negotiating a new contract that will provide equal treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The conference was dominated by Clinton's political proteges who
may benefit in 2000 by embracing mental health initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   Tipper and Al Gore and the first lady took turns interviewing
mental health experts and former patients in a talk-show style
format.
</P>
<P>
   Tipper Gore talked with Mike Wallace of television's ``60
Minutes'' about his bouts with depression and also referred to her
own illness following a serious accident involving her son who was
hit by a car.
</P>
<P>
   She spoke of the importance of public figures sharing their
stories ``so that people can see that it is very wrong to
discriminate against people who have a mental health issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, who is expected to run for the White House in 2000,
also interviewed a woman, Robin Kitchell of Franklin Tenn., whose
son had bipolar disorder and the vice president of the Bank One
Corp., which offers parity in mental health benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton, who is expected to stress her interest in
health care in a likely New York Senate bid, spoke to several
medical experts, including Harold Koplewicz, the director of the
New York University Child Study Center, who talked about ways of
treating mental illness.

AN AFRICAN `ANTIGONE,' PRESENTED IN PARIS
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By ALAN RIDING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The underlying themes of the Greek tragedies have easily
survived the 25 or more centuries since the plays were written:
power versus morality; laws of man vs. laws of God; reasons of
state vs. reasons of the heart. Indeed, their very universality
makes them ever topical and easily adaptable, and that perhaps
explains why a West African version of Sophocles' ``Antigone'' has
just been presented to acclaim in Paris. The French-language
production, which will be touring Mali, Guinea and Senegal in the
coming weeks, remains true to the story of Antigone, who risks
death by defying King Creon's order that her brother be denied a
proper funeral. But there are twists: here the actors are dressed
in ornate and colorful African gowns and use the formal gesture of
tribal ritual, while the role of the chorus is supplemented by
African chants and musical instruments.
</P>
<P>
   The text, prepared by Jean-Louis Sagot-Duvauroux and Habib
Dembele, has also been adapted to add a few moments of humor and,
above all, to make the play even more topical. It develops a theme
only touched on by Sophocles, that Creon finds Antigone's
disobedience all the more intolerable because she is a woman. ``So
you have decided that I am no longer the man?'' he asks her
indignantly. ``So, from now on you, you are the man?''
</P>
<P>
   The idea that women represent the voice of reason is underlined
by having five women serve as the chorus and by giving a woman,
Helene Diarra, the crucial role of Tiresias, the blind seer who
warns Creon that disaster will befall him if he insists on
condemning Antigone to death. Finally, after his son Haemon and his
wife, Eurydice, commit suicide, the chorus tells him that this is
his punishment for not following the path of women.
</P>
<P>
   Sophocles did not go that far (his final admonition was about
arrogance of power), but he certainly pointed the way. ``It is
better to fall from power, if it is so fated, by a man's hand than
we be called weaker than women,'' Creon tells Haemon when he begs
for Antigone's life in Sophocles' play. Minutes later, Creon again
scorns his son with ``Poor creature, submitting to a woman.''
</P>
<P>
   For all its West African trappings, then, this version holds
firm to universal messages. This was certainly the aim of the new
Mandeka Theatre in Bamako, Mali, when it chose ``Antigone'' for its
inaugural production. It wanted a play that it could adapt and
export so that classical theater could be seen in West Africa and
West African theater could be seen abroad.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of this experiment is Sotigui Kouyate, 63, an
actor from Burkina Faso who for 15 years has been a member of Peter
Brook's Paris-based experimental theater company. Kouyate not only
directs this production and plays the central role of Creon but
also is the driving force in creating a company of actors at the
Mandeka Theatre. He was able to recruit some experienced actors,
including Dembele and Ms. Diarra, but he also looked for new
talent. For one, Djeneba Kone, the beautiful young actress who
plays Antigone, is a newcomer to the stage.
</P>
<P>
   Given the poverty of Mali, it was inevitable that the company
would have to look to an array of French sources to finance the
production. As a result, this ``Antigone'' has been seen in France
_ in Paris, it was presented at the Theatre des Bouffes du Nord,
Brook's permanent home _ before West Africa. And while here the
company has been trying to raise money from the public so that West
African schoolchildren and students can also see the play. A
donation of the equivalent of $5 will pay for one ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Still, perhaps most important for the new company's morale is
that the production played to full houses here and was applauded
not as an expression of African folklore but as an original
interpretation of a classical play. It was helped by the
coincidence of a Paris production of a different Sophocles play,
``Oedipus Rex,'' which was far less well received by French
critics.
</P>
<P>
   Kouyate's choice of a Greek tragedy also proved surprisingly
suited to the stylized rituals of West African village life. The
Mandeka Theatre ``has carried the story toward the African custom
of storytelling where the chants, music and commentaries directed
at the audience form an integral part of the action,'' wrote Noelle
Moris, a theater critic, in the Paris daily Liberation.
</P>
<P>
   Sagot-Duvauroux, who a decade ago wrote both a play and
screenplay dedicated to Toussaint L'Ouverture, the rebel Haitian
slave leader, said this storytelling tradition corresponded to the
structure of the ancient tragedies by giving the chorus the
importance it deserves. Similarly, he noted, the formality of the
play made it possible to use West African hand gestures, including
expressions of respect for elders, without sliding into what he
called ``ethnographic transposition.''
</P>
<P>
   The writer said that one reason for emphasizing the man-woman
confrontation in his version was that it seemed more credible today
than arguments over funeral rites. ``But in some aspects,'' he
said, ``notably marriage ceremonies and the weight of male power,
but also the entrenched tradition of female autonomy, West Africa's
societies and cultures are in harmony with the tragic debate that
prompts Antigone to challenge Creon.''
</P>
<P>
   Brook, whose blessing of productions in his theater is not
always assured, said that Kouyate had gone ``to the heart'' of
Greek tragedy. ``In this production, it is not we who are
transported to another era,'' he said. ``On the contrary, it is
another era that suddenly is present, and we live it with the
actors as if for the first time.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, for one hour 50 minutes one recent evening, the Theatre
des Bouffes du Nord seemed closer to Africa than Greece, closer to
Bamako than Thebes. The language was French (although some chants
were in the Malian tribal language of Bambara), but the costumes,
the movements, at times even the humor, were definitely African.
Indeed, after the final curtain on the last performance here, the
show went on. An African band took over the cafe next to the
theater and the dancing began.
</P>
<P>
   This, perhaps, Sophocles did not have in mind.

LAZARD FRERES REPLACES ITS TOP U.S. EXECUTIVE
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lazard Freres &AMP; Co., the boutique investment banking
partnership, announced plans on Monday to integrate its London,
Paris and New York operations and to reshuffle its executive ranks
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The changes are significant for the elite private firm. Though
highly profitable, Lazard has fallen behind rivals like Goldman,
Sachs and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in the lucrative business of
advising top executives on strategy. The integration of Lazard's
European and American operations, long noted for proud
individualism, seems intended in part to compete with the fluid
global networks of other investment banks.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the overhaul, William R. Loomis Jr., 51, will replace
Steven Rattner, 47, as deputy chief executive and the firm's top
day-to-day executive in the United States. Rattner, who held the
post for two years, will remain with the firm as vice chairman but
has indicated to colleagues that he may pursue outside interests.
</P>
<P>
   The moves by the firm were reported on Monday by The Wall Street
Journal.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rattner decided to step aside on his own, several people at the
firm said, rather than take on the increased administrative duties
involved in merging Lazard's international operations. A longtime
contributor to the Democratic Party, Rattner has been an active
supporter of Vice President Al Gore. But Monday he played down the
possibility of leaving Lazard to join Gore's campaign for
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to keep all my options open,'' Rattner said. ``But to
paraphrase Mark Twain, reports of my departure are wildly
premature.''
</P>
<P>
   Michel A. David-Weill, Lazard's chairman and chief executive,
said that the integration of the three Lazard units should be
completed within six months. He said in an interview that partners
based in New York, London and Paris, who now divide the profits
generated by their individual units, would share the profits pooled
from the three units. The units will also do more to share
expertise and specialist bankers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are creating the only true international partnership in our
business,'' David-Weill said. ``It will not be French, American or
British, but rather a global partnership built on a common
philosophy of independent advice for clients.''
</P>
<P>
   David-Weill's family has controlled the 151-year-old Lazard
franchise for generations. Though people at the firm say that
David-Weill, who is 66, does not play a hands-on role _ he spends
nearly the entire summer in the south of France _ he has sometimes
intervened to change managers and has long pushed to get the three
units to cooperate more.
</P>
<P>
   That task has been difficult. A private partners meeting last
fall to discuss measures to integrate concluded without a solid
decision to do so, people close to the firm said. Lazard partners
in New York have resisted integrating with their European
counterparts because they take home more money each year on average
than partners in London or Paris and are reluctant to share their
profits.
</P>
<P>
   But that territorial approach has become increasingly
anachronistic. Nearly every other major investment bank has long
since established seamless global operations.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Goldman, Sachs, the last bulge-bracket investment bank
_ that is, one with substantial activity in all global banking
areas _ that still operated on the partnership model, recently went
public. Resistance at Lazard has broken down in recent months,
people there said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The necessity of it is now perceived throughout the whole
organization, in a real fashion,'' said David-Weill, who has worked
to bring the houses together since 1975, when he replaced his
father as head of Lazard in Paris. ``When people are all convinced,
it's time to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Loomis will be the key executive overseeing worldwide
cooperation for the firm. A graduate of Williams College and
Harvard Business School and a Lazard partner for 15 years, Loomis
has had several responsibilities in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Loomis was the clear and obvious choice to succeed Steve
Rattner,'' David-Weill said, adding that he regretted Rattner's
decision to relinquish his post. ``We would have preferred to have
Steve remain as deputy chief executive, but we understand and
respect his desire to step back from his operating responsibilities
as we begin the next phase of consolidating our worldwide
operations.''
</P>
<P>
   During Rattner's run as deputy chief executive in 1997 and 1998,
the firm posted record profits. Earnings grew 40 percent in 1998, a
tough year for many other investment banks. But Lazard has slipped
a bit in the rankings of mergers and acquisition advice, its core
business, dropping to tenth last year worldwide from fourth place.
Its performance in this year's first quarter was stronger, with
Lazard benefiting from a wave of mergers in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The firm has experienced management turmoil in recent years,
including the departure of several leading bankers. Among them was
Rattner's predecessor, Felix Rohatyn, a Wall Street legend who
helped save New York City from bankruptcy in the 1970s. He is now
the United States ambassador in France.
</P>
<P>
   Rattner has sought to institute a corporate overlay to the
partnership, with mixed success, people there said. The firm now
plans to set up an international, seven-person executive committee
to coordinate activities at all its operations. The members of that
committee were not named Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Even as chief executive, Rattner continued to be one of Lazard's
top deal makers. He has recently advised clients including Comcast,
America Online, Starbucks and The New York Times and will continue
to serve as a senior banker.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, Lazard has taken steps to bring its houses closer
together. The last significant reorganization of the three banks
was in 1996, when the firm began pooling some profits to share
among partners worldwide. Last year, Lazard Asset Management merged
with Lazard Brothers Asset Management in London and Lazard Japan
Asset Management in Tokyo, a move now seen as a model for
integrating the investment banking operations. &QL;

WANTING THEIR FIRST STANLEY CUP KEY TO SEVERAL STARS (For use by
NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
DALLAS _ Two inches, maybe less. That's all that separated Stars
captain Derian Hatcher from his lifelong dream.
<TEXT>
<P>
   He remembers thinking that if he just extended his fingertips
he'd be able to grab hold, to touch the Stanley Cup. It was right
there, cradled like an infant in his childhood friend Shawn
Chambers' arms.
</P>
<P>
   Chambers, now a Stars defenseman, had been along for New
Jersey's Cup-winning season in 1995, and as dictated by tradition,
he had his day to do whatever he wanted with the Cup. Chambers
decided to hold a party in the house where he had grown up and on
the street where he and Hatcher had played so many games of street
hockey together.
</P>
<P>
   Chambers urged Hatcher to rub the shiny metal for luck, to have
his photo taken as they had always dreamed of doing as boys, to
just reach out and touch the Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never touched it. I never picked it up,'' Hatcher said. ``It
really wasn't a superstitious thing. It was that I didn't win it. I
realized that one day I'd have a chance to win it, and I'd pick it
up then.''
</P>
<P>
   Once again, Hatcher finds himself so close to the Cup that he
can almost reach out and touch it. Four victories, and he will. It
will be his party and his right.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely exciting,'' Hatcher said, the smile spreading
across his face.
</P>
<P>
   With all that has been said about the Stars' Cup experience _
eight players already have their names engraved on the Cup with
other teams _ the Stars' players who have never won the Cup might
be the key in getting the Stars' organization its first.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there is something to be said for winning it. Former Cup
winners Guy Carbonneau, Craig Ludwig and Joe Nieuwendyk will tell
you there is nothing more motivating than holding the Cup while
skating around the rink after the Stanley Cup-clinching game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yeah, I remember,'' said Nieuwendyk, who last touched the
Cup with Calgary in 1989. ``I was also a young guy when I went
through this 10 years ago, and I don't think I had the appreciation
of it like I do now, whether it's just age or having gone through
the wars of 10 more years.''
</P>
<P>
   Or as Ludwig described it: ``There's a lot of us who know what
it's like at the end of the rainbow, and we want that back. For a
few of us, we know we don't have many kicks of the can left. To us,
this is very important.''
</P>
<P>
   But, there is also something to be said for wanting it. Stars
players Ed Belfour, Darryl Sydor and Mike Modano, among others,
will tell you there is nothing quite as motivating as getting close
then having to watch somebody else hold the Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour went to a Stanley Cup Finals in 1992, but his Chicago
Blackhawks were swept by Pittsburgh. Sydor went to a Stanley Cup
Finals with the Los Angeles Kings in 1993, winning Game 1 in
Montreal, only to lose the next four.
</P>
<P>
   Modano went with the Stars in 1991, back when they were the
North Stars and located in Minnesota. He says he hasn't forgotten
that feeling of being, like Hatcher, so close and yet unable to
reach his hand and grab it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You dream about it and think about it when you are alone,''
said Modano, whose team lost 8-0 to Pittsburgh in the sixth and
final game of the series. ``The anticipation of having the
opportunity, the chance to be here and play for it since \Rthen\S.
It's been something we've all been looking forward to and trying to
get to.''
</P>
<P>
   Modano turned 29 yesterday, and was in his first season when he
went to the Finals.
</P>
<P>
   Stars winger Dave Reid has been playing for 16 seasons now, and
this marks his first trip to the Finals. He has been to the
semifinals a couple of times, with Boston in 1992 and the Stars
last season.
</P>
<P>
   He says he hasn't allowed himself to think ahead to what he
would do if the Stars were to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's huge,'' Reid said. ``I remember playing with my brothers,
street hockey, table-top hockey, anything to do with hockey, and we
were always playing for the Stanley Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   He finally saw the Cup in person not too long ago. He didn't
touch it, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really an unwritten rule,'' Stars winger Pat Verbeek
explained.
</P>
<P>
   Verbeek had a chance to touch it. He was 17. His father wanted
to get a photo with him and the Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said no,'' Verbeek said. ``I didn't want to get a picture
with it until I had a chance to win it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen years have passed, and Verbeek has never been as close
as he was that day. Until now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've spent 16 years trying to get this far,'' said Verbeek,
who was a victory away from a berth in the Stanley Cup Finals in
1988 with New Jersey, which lost to Boston, 6-2. ``You've got to
make the best of it while you're here because you may never get
another chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there is something to be said for winning it. But, there is
also something to be said for wanting it.
</P>
<P>
   Verbeek has wanted to hold the Stanley Cup ever since he was a
little boy in the back yard pretending he played for the Boston
Bruins. And at the end of a long game, he thrust his arms in the
air, pretending the Cup was there.
</P>
<P>
   It was a childhood moment shared by guys like Modano and Hull
and Belfour and Hatcher.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it's within their grasp. nn

AFFORDABLE SPAS  
 HEADING TO SARDINIA  
 PUERTO RICO SUMMER EVENTS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 13) 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By RAY CORMIER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I would like to go to a spa for a week or so to work on my
weight and fitness, but most seem to be very expensive. Are there
any that are more affordable? _ C.M. Kulwin, Upper Montclair, N.J. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The popularity of spas is based on pampering at least as much
as sweating, so prices are going to reflect that. But if you
consider less than $1,000 reasonable for a week's accommodations,
three meals a day and exercise and relaxation programs, there are a
few places in the Northeast that fit the bill, at least outside of
peak season. The three here offer shorter stays, too.
</P>
<P>
   At Deerfield Spa, in Marshall's Creek, Pa., near East
Stroudsburg, double-occupancy rates range from $799 to $970 a week
(plus 6 percent tax and a 15 percent service charge) and include
two half-hour massages. Heather McMahon, a spokeswoman, said that
the spa features low-fat cuisine and that exercise programs range
from a ``boot camp'' experience to Pilates to aquatic aerobics.
</P>
<P>
   The spa has a gym for strength training, an outdoor heated pool,
hot tub and sauna. A naturalist leads hikes on Pocono trails.
</P>
<P>
   Deerfield accepts up to 33 guests for what Ms. McMahon described
as a ``nonchalant, not ostentatious'' program. Most guests stay in
the three-floor main house in rooms decorated country style, with
lots of floral prints. A one-story annex has larger rooms, two with
king-size beds. Deerfield is open April to mid-November.
</P>
<P>
   Contact Deerfield at 650 Resica Falls Road, East Stroudsburg,
Pa. 18301; (800) 852-4494, fax (570) 223-8270; or
www.deerfieldspa.com. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Vatra Mountain Valley Lodge and Spa is on 15 acres at the base
of Hunter Mountain in the Catskills. Exercise options include a
variety of aerobics, aqua fitness, yoga and dance. There is a
fitness room and tennis, volleyball and basketball courts.
</P>
<P>
   The spa has 27 rooms with televisions and phones, some with
balconies and skylights. Meals are vegetarian totaling up to 1,200
calories a day. Weekly guests get four 30-minute massages in the
$978 to $1,290 rates, which include all fees and taxes. Other
treatments, which are extra, include seaweed wraps ($75) and a
European facial ($60)
</P>
<P>
   Vatra Mountain, Route 214, Post Office Box F, Hunter, N.Y.
12442; (800) 232-2772, fax (518) 263-4994.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the Catskills is New Age Health Spa, where, says
Patricia Fahie, director of marketing, most guests seek stress
reduction. But it offers fitness classes and for the seriously
overweight a program meant to lead to the loss of 50 pounds or
more.
</P>
<P>
   A typical day at the spa might include Zen meditation, an
aerobic walk, water aerobics and yoga or tai chi. The spa features
a 50-foot Alpine tower for climbing while wearing a harness. There
are Trotter strength machines, free weights and cardio equipment,
and indoor and outdoor pools. A variety of salon services cost
extra.
</P>
<P>
   Weekly double rates are $855 to $1,064 a person, plus 8 percent
tax and 17 percent service charges. Here and at Deerfield (but not
at Vatra), singles can be assigned a roommate. New Age, Neversink,

   Q. I am planning a trip to Sardinia this fall. What is the best
way to get there from Italy and what are some important sites? _
V.M. Palacios, Staten Island, N.Y. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Going to Sardinia should be easier in the fall than in
summer. The chances are the crystal-clear waters will still be warm
enough to swim in and there won't be the crush of tourists that
flock to the beautiful beaches, especially on the Emerald Coast in
the north, in summer.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the beaches, the island's capital, Cagliari, in the
south, is worth a visit for its 13th century cathedral, national
archeological museum and a Roman amphitheater. Sassari, the second
largest city, has a medieval center, and 11 miles away is the
12th-century Camaldulian abbey.
</P>
<P>
   The inland areas are rural and hold many ruins. Remnants of the
nuraghi, cone-shaped fortified tower houses made from massive
stones well before the birth of Christ, dot the interior. Some of
the most interesting of these are at Barumini, about 35 miles north
of Cagliari.
</P>
<P>
   Alitalia, (800) 223-5730, flies to Cagliari from most major
Italian cities. There are at least eight daily flights from Rome,
for example, costing about $210 round trip, at 1,868 lira to $1. A
regional airline, Meridiana, (800) 275-5566, flies to Olbia as well
as Cagliari from Rome, Milan and other cities, for about $100 each
way. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another option is to take a ferry. Among the major lines is
Tirrenia Navigazione, which has an overnight ferry from
Civitavecchia, near Rome, to Cagliari each evening at 6:30. It also
has a three-and-a-half-hour hydrofoil crossing at 8:30 a.m.; a
round-trip ticket is about $85. According to the Italian government
Tourist Board, it's best to call the Naples office for
reservations: (39-081) 720-1111, fax (39-081) 720-1441.
</P>
<P>
   The Italian State Railway runs ferries to Olbia, a board
spokeswoman said, for about half Tirrenia's prices. Tickets must be
bought at railroad stations, though. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Could you tell me what cultural events are on the schedule in
Puerto Rico in July and August? _ Phyllis Mate, Brooklyn, N.Y. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. A couple of summer highlights on the island involve lively
music and dance. From July 26 to 31, the World Salsa Congress will
spice up El San Juan Hotel and Casino in Isla Verde. Richard
Goenaga, general manager of the congress, said that the event
focuses on the dancers, coming from 32 countries to show off
different styles. Each night at least three top bands will play, as
well. Nightly tickets are $40, a four-night pass $150. For more
information, call (787) 274-1601.
</P>
<P>
   The Loiza Carnival, July 23 to Aug. 1, is an annual celebration
of the African heritage of the northeastern town of Loiza. Besides
parades, it features performances of the bomba, the lively
Afro-Caribbean dance form. Free; (787) 876-3570.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional music and dance is also part of the Tourism Artisans
Fair, July 30 to Aug. 1 at Plaza de la Darsena and Paseo de la
Princesa in Old San Juan. This free event will include several folk
dance and singing performances, and will bring together more than
200 artisans showing and selling their crafts.
</P>
<P>
   To learn more about these and other events on the island,
including the many town patron-saint festivals, contact the New
York office of the Puerto Rico Tourism Co. at (800) 233-6530, or
see www.prtourism.com.

CHINA SEEKS TO WIN OVER DISSENTERS ON JOINING TRADE GROUP
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By SETH FAISON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ China's top trade official, acknowledging for
the first time that many lower-level Chinese officials oppose the
nation's proposed entry to the World Trade Organization, said in
newspaper reports published on Monday that the government would
begin a broad campaign to try to temper the internal discord.
</P>
<P>
   The official, Wu Yi, said the government was preparing a report
to explain why China should join the organization that sets the
rules for global commerce. She said that a series of meetings was
planned for senior officials and leaders of state enterprises to
explain the status of negotiations and solicit opinions.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wu is a member of China's Cabinet, with responsibility for
trade issues. Her comments, printed in the China Market Economy
News and other government-run publications, appeared to mark a
distinctly new public approach to the effort to join the trade
organization, by seeking to assuage internal opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Beijing's stance has been to pretend no opposition
existed, even though many Chinese officials are known to be unhappy
at the prospect of more open competition with international
companies, one of the consequences of joining the trade
organization.
</P>
<P>
   As relations between China and the United States were battered
in the political furor that followed NATO's bombing of the Chinese
Embassy in Belgrade on May 7, supporters of trade organization
entry became vulnerable to accusations that China was giving away
too much to demands from Americans, who were demonized as China's
enemy.
</P>
<P>
   In Monday's report, Ms. Wu used a more humble tone than in
previous public discussions, arguing that since negotiations are
still under way, Chinese leaders can still change proposals that
have been made in negotiations with American officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``If everybody feels it is unacceptable, that America's price is
too high, then we can withdraw'' the proposals, Ms. Wu said at a
meeting in Shanghai in May, the report said. ``It is possible to
make a fresh start again.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond sounding a conciliatory note to those who oppose
membership in the trade organization, Ms. Wu's comments also
contained an implicit warning to American negotiators not to push
China too hard, since internal support for membership is delicate.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, China's leadership has insisted that it was unanimous
in desiring to enter the trade organization, and has not wavered in
the 13 years it has sought membership.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Ms. Wu said that the central committee of the Communist
Party had carefully weighed the pros and cons of entry in the trade
organization, suggesting that objections had been raised
internally, before finally deciding in favor of entry. Ms. Wu has
spoken forcefully in support of Prime Minister Zhu Rongji's
position that China needs to join the trade organization, which
would open vast new markets to Chinese exports as well as granting
greater foreign business access to China's 1.2 billion consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wu's comments appear to reflect the leadership's confidence
that different opinions can now be discussed openly. It is unlikely
the leadership would publicly start a campaign it did not think it
could win.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most surprising element in Monday's report was Ms.
Wu's pointed mention that senior officials from China's
telecommunications industry would be invited to briefings on trade
organization negotiations, since they are known to be among the
strongest opponents of entry.
</P>
<P>
   Wu Jichuan, China's minister of telecommunications, submitted
his resignation earlier this year in an intense bureaucratic battle
with Prime Minister Zhu. After contradictory public statements
about Wu's status, he has officially remained in his position.

FRENCH CONGLOMERATE TO ACQUIRE FILM PRODUCTION COMPANY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Vivendi SA of France is to acquire Pathe SA, France's
biggest film producing and distribution company, for $2 billion in
stock, in a complex deal that promises to push forward the
consolidation already under way in the European television
business.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, announced on Monday in Paris, tightens Vivendi's grip
on Canal Plus, its television affiliate, and gives it a 17 percent
stake in British Sky Broadcasting, the television company
controlled by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Marie Messier, Vivendi's chief executive, said the company
wanted to be a ``major European player in pay television, and in
this context the stake in BSkyB is important.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal, and Messier's remarks, raised speculation that he
might attempt to restart negotiations to merge Canal Plus and
BSkyB, the two largest pay-for-view television companies in Europe,
which broke down earlier this year after Canal Plus demanded
management control. Officials at BSkyB declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Canal Plus rose nearly 7 percent Monday, BSkyB shares
rose 2.5 percent and Vivendi's share price rose a half percent.
Pathe shares were suspended from trading.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's deal will give Vivendi, a $35 billion conglomerate that
derives most of its profit from utilities, full control of Pathe.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms, the family of Pathe's chief executive, Jerome
Seydoux, which until now owned a controlling share in Pathe, will
subsequently buy back Pathe's film business and shares in the Paris
daily Liberation and a French soccer team. Vivendi then gets
Pathe's shares in a Canal Plus satellite television venture,
CanalSatellite, and in BSkyB, and the Seydoux family holding
company, Fornier SA, will then be renamed Pathe. Messier, the
42-year old executive who reorganized Vivendi after taking control
in 1996, when it was known as Generale des Eaux, said the deal was
``good for Canal Plus shareholders, and notably for the most
important of them, Vivendi.''
</P>
<P>
   Pierre Lescure, chief executive of Canal Plus, told reporters in
Paris that the link would enable Canal Plus to cooperate with BSkyB
in developing services, most notably for the Internet, but he did
not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   The pay-for-view television market in Europe is valued at $10
billion and is expected to double by the year 2005. In recent
months, Murdoch has made sporadic attempts to negotiate with Canal
Plus, but the most recent effort collapsed in March over management
control. Earlier, Messier had increased Vivendi's stake in Pathe,
and through it in BSkyB, to exert greater influence on any deal
with Murdoch, who owns 40 percent of BSkyB.
</P>
<P>
   BSkyB is the biggest pay-for-view broadcaster in Britain, with 7
million subscribers, but Murdoch's efforts to move onto the
Continent have met less success. In March, Murdoch opted not to
join a deal between the Kirch group of Germany and Fininvest, the
television holding company of Silvio Berlusconi. In April, the
British government blocked BSkyB's planned $1 billion takeover of
Manchester United, the soccer team at the forefront of European
sports marketing.
</P>
<P>
   For Canal Plus, the benefit of a deal with BSkyB would be in
avoiding a costly battle for market share, especially at a time
when it is digesting major expansion moves, including the $1.2
billion takeover of the Dutch digital broadcaster Nethold. Last
year, Canal Plus reported net losses of $31 million, though it
expects to make money this year.
</P>
<P>
   And Murdoch will not play dead. In recent weeks, he signed a
deal giving News Corp. a stake in Stream, an Italian pay television
venture that competes with a Canal Plus affiliate, Telepiu, and won
a bidding war in Germany to broadcast soccer that gives him a
bridgehead into German pay television.

DISNEY SEEKS TO BUY BALANCE OF INFOSEEK

<TEXT>
<P>
   In a series of moves intended to expand its role on the
Internet, Walt Disney Co. confirmed on Monday that it was in talks
to buy the 57 percent of Infoseek that it does not already own.
</P>
<P>
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the
company said only that it was in talks with Infoseek, an Internet
search service that has helped Disney set up Go Network, its own
Internet portal. It gave no details of any proposed deal.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Disney also said that Jake Winebaum, who has headed
Disney's Internet operations, was leaving to start Ecompanies, an
incubator for Internet companies, with Sky Dayton, the chairman of
Earthlink Network Inc.

   John Tinker, an analyst at Bank of America Securities, called
the departure of Winebaum _ who oversaw the creation of Disney.com,
ABCNews.com and ABC.com _ a disappointment. But Tinker added that
Disney was somewhat protected because it would have a stake in
Ecompanies.
</P>
<P>
   Disney has apparently become eager to create an Internet
currency to buy and invest in new businesses. Buying the
outstanding 57 percent of Infoseek _ a stake worth about $1.5
billion on Monday _ would provide it with such a currency.
</P>
<P>
   In its filing, Disney said it was considering acquiring
Infoseek's outstanding stock in exchange for shares of Disney. It
also said it was considering issuing a tracking stock that would
reflect the operations of both Infoseek and Disney's Internet
businesses, an indication that Disney planned to meld the two
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Tracking stocks are shares that belong to the parent company but
track the performance of underlying assets. Analysts say that
tracking stocks give the parent company more control over the
existing assets, a circumstance presumably preferable to Michael
Eisner, the Disney chairman, who tends to like to keep control over
his company's operations.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Infoseek rose $6.3125 Monday, to $43, as rumors of a
deal swept through Wall Street. Disney rose, too, up 25 cents a
share, to $30.875.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a tracking stock remains a somewhat unusual security, and
it has not been Disney's style to create spinoff companies with
unusual characteristics.
</P>
<P>
   One analyst said that the move signaled Disney's intense concern
about the weak performance of its own stock, which is off its
52-week high of $40.3125.

DONATIONS FOR L.A. CHARTER REFORM MEASURE HIT FRENZIED PACE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY RICK ORLOV  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- The battle over reform of Los Angeles city
government climaxed Monday in a barrage of mailers, TV ads and more
controversy over funding of campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   City Council members who spearheaded the fight against charter
reform with public employee unions attacked a late $50,000
contribution from the Los Angeles Times' parent corporation, Times
Mirror Co., to Yes on Measure 1 -- the ballot issue to be decided
by voters Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The criticism erupted even as Council President John Ferraro was
donating a second $50,000 from his officeholder account, which was
funded by political contributors, and Councilwoman Ruth Galanter
was giving $10,000 from hers to the opponents of charter reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always a problem when a newspaper gets involved
because it makes you wonder if it affects the reporting of the
issue,'' said Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg. ``You wonder. Reporters
aren't allowed to get involved, but publishers are.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the inimitable words of Samuel Clemens, you will have the
best government that money can buy,'' said Goldberg.
</P>
<P>
   Times spokesman David Garcia said the criticism was misplaced
since the donation came from the corporate entity and not the
newspaper directly.
</P>
<P>
   ``One is the newspaper, the other is the corporate entity,''
Garcia said. ``And it has no impact on the news coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   The Times and Times Mirror are located in the same building in
downtown L.A. Records indicate the Times Mirror contribution was
made last Thursday, the same day Times Mirror Chairman and CEO Mark
Willes relinquished the role of publisher of the Times to
concentrate on corporate matters.
</P>
<P>
   The Times has strongly endorsed charter reform and previously
criticized the Daily News for giving $60,000 last year to the San
Fernando Valley petition drive to get a formal study of cityhood,
an issue that will only go before voters if the county Local Agency
Formation Commission orders a ballot measure. The Times has
strongly opposed possible secession by the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Among other significant late contributions was a $100,000
donation by Mayor Richard Riordan, who has organized an estimated
$1.5 million effort to win passage of a new charter to replace the
city's 75-year-old constitution that has been amended nearly 400
times.
</P>
<P>
   Also joining Riordan in backing the proposal was Michael Milken
and the Petersen Properties, each giving $25,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mayor has been a longtime supporter of charter reform and
he's putting his money where his mouth is,'' said Deputy Mayor
Noelia Rodriguez, who is on a leave during the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides, it's not the money that should be the issue, but the
issue of charter reform and the future of Los Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   Disclosure last week of a $200,000 contribution from media and
entertainment mogul Rupert Murdoch, who owns Fox television and
20th Century Fox among many other properties, sparked fiery attacks
from council members, but the reaction to the Times Mirror
contribution was more subdued.
</P>
<P>
   ``The original charter was reformed because big business tried
to control it,'' Councilman Mike Hernandez said. ``Riordan wasn't
around, but the L.A. Times was.
</P>
<P>
   ``From my perspective it's not going to change the reality that
around the kitchen table, people aren't talking about charter
reform. And the reality is that ... that very few people will be
deciding the constitution to our city. I don't think those are
people who can be bought.'

campaigns, expected to be updated today, are available on the

GLOVES ARE OFF AS THE STANLEY CUP FINALS OPEN 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ On the eve of the Stanley Cup finals, the Dallas Stars
and Buffalo Sabres exchanged psychological thrusts and parries on
Monday. The Sabres talked about how those Stars cheat on face-offs
and how maybe the officials should be aware of it. The Stars
mentioned that Buffalo goalie Dominik Hasek sometimes gets upset
when he is bumped and how maybe he should worry about the Stars'
bumping him _ legally, of course. And what about Mike Modano's
comments about the finals being anti-climactic?
</P>
<P>
   Amid the winks and the nudges and the tongues in the cheeks,
someone asked Stars Coach Ken Hitchcock about the entertainment
value of the championship round for an ice-bound, winter sport that
struggles for the sports spotlight in the heat of June. Some
critics have said that Dallas plays an effective but dull style by
emphasizing defense and that the Sabres play the same way. How will
this style help sell the game to casual viewers in the Sun Belt and
even up north? Hearing this, Hitchcock turned quite serious and
contrasted his sport with figure skating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, this isn't going to be a series made for television,''
Hitchcock said. ``If you look for `Champions on Ice,' you're
watching the wrong game. This is going to be a hard-fought,
passionate contest, where ice is going to be defended very tough.
And it is going to be a series that is going to have both teams'
wills get extended to the max.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have two teams as committed, it's going to make for
very emotional hockey. I don't know if that's going to go across
television. But if you are in the building, you are going to see
two teams passionately go at each other like no other series.''
</P>
<P>
   The four-of-seven-game series begins here Tuesday night in
Reunion Arena, with Game 2 here on Thursday night. Games 3 and 4
will be in Buffalo on Saturday and June 15. The Stars are heavily
favored because they were top-seeded over all, while the Sabres
were seventh-seeded in the East.
</P>
<P>
   By playing from October to the brink of summer, the National
Hockey League has tested the attention span of even its most
devoted fans. With four consecutive sweeps, the finals since 1994
have been anticlimactic. Modano, the Dallas center, said as much
last week, after the Stars ousted the Colorado Avalanche in seven
games in the Western finals. He was speaking about the perception
of others, but he also said he stopped watching the Eastern half of
the tournament after high-seeded teams like New Jersey and Ottawa
were upset.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Modano backtracked, saying that his comments were taken
out of context and that he did not mean to disparage the Sabres.
``It was nothing to light a fire under them,'' Modano said. ``I
don't want to get into a war of words. Grade me the way I play, not
the way I talk.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone certainly will. In that any motivational edge can help
an underdog, Dixon Ward made it clear that he and other Sabres were
aware of what Modano said.
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether the Dallas-Colorado round was the true
championship, Ward said: ``I didn't remember them pulling the
Stanley Cup out for that series. It doesn't matter to us. It's not
anticlimactic for us whatsoever. We've earned the right to play for
the Stanley Cup. Nobody's handed us anything. Nobody gave us a free
ride. We beat three very good hockey teams. Whatever people's
perceptions are, that's up to them.''
</P>
<P>
   As for cheating on face-offs, Buffalo Coach Lindy Ruff brought
it up and captain Mike Peca amplified it. When asked about the
Stars' winning ways on the draws, Ruff said: ``The one thing they
are very good at is cheating on face-offs. We've got to be aware of
that. Sometimes, they don't get their stick down. We want both
players to have their sticks down.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got Brian Skrudland. He cheats with the best of them.
He's been playing for 20-plus years; he's got a lot of experience
behind him. Obviously, it's a big issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Peca added: ``Like Lindy said, they've got a lot of experienced
cheaters on the face-offs. Our guys go in and put our sticks down
and have our feet in the right spot. We've just got to make sure
that we're either cheating a little bit ourselves or making the
linesmen aware of their guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Skrudland added some gamesmanship when talking about Hasek, the
best goalie in the sport, who has not fully recovered from a groin
injury and sometimes becomes upset when opposing forwards jostle
him. Skrudland, who carries a full bag of tricks from team to team,
recalled the third round of last spring's Eastern Conference finals
and how the Washington Capitals took the momentum from Buffalo
after an incident between Hasek and Petr Bondra of the Capitals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he was throwing his gloves at Petr Bondra last year and
people said, `Gee, that might have been the turning point,'''
Skrudland said. ``If it takes that, we'll do whatever we have to do
to win. Everything within the rules. We never cheat.''

BEATINGS, FEAR OF DEATH IN CRAMPED SERB PRISON 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating to restore missing portion)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MORINA, Albania _ On Saturday, Niman Kurti was in a Kosovo
prison, crammed in with hundreds of other ethnic Albanian men who
say they were being beaten and nearly starved.
</P>
<P>
   Kurti had no idea that two days earlier, Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milsevic had signed an a NATO-imposed peace plan that
promised he would begin pulling out military forces from the
province and allow Kosovar refugees to return home.
</P>
<P>
   He had no idea where his family was, or whether he would survive
his internment at Smrkovnica Prison, near Mitrovica.
</P>
<P>
   He said Monday he had been crammed against a wall with other
Albanian men when he overheard one of the guards saying to a
colleague, ``We must do something with them immediately, because we
don't know what's going on with them tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Kurti froze. He thought the guards were planning to kill him and
the other Albanian males, ranging in age from 12 to 85, in the
camp. After they reached Albania on Monday, they said they had been
systematically rounded up from villages near Mitrovica, separated
form their wives and children, and packed into the nearby
Smrkovnica prison.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the 33-year-old Kurti was herded onto a bus with other
jailed men, beaten again, and then forced to walk across the border
into Albania. He was among the most recent refugees to arrive in
Albania at the Morina Pass, where every day for 10 days the former
prisoners, perhaps 2,000 to 3,000 of them by some estimates, have
been straggling over the border.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the prisoners, the flow of refugees has dwindled in
recent days, aid workers say. Immediately after the NATO bombing
began, refugees were streaming over the border at the rate of 1,000
an hour.
</P>
<P>
   With the war in its third month and three-quarters of a million
refugees now out of Kosovo, the sad men from the Smrkovnica Prison
are virtually the only refugees still arriving. And their stories
are perhaps more terrifying than those of their predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   The former camp inmates are gaunt, even skeletal, the result of
days or weeks of near starvation by their Serbian captors, they
said. Their bodies are marked with deep purple bruises, and many
have black eyes and split lips, the legacy of frequent beatings,
they said. They tell of being forced to squat for hours, then made
to stand _ which makes the knees buckle. Those who fell were beaten
badly, the men said.
</P>
<P>
   Meals consisted of two pieces of bread a day, sometimes served
with cold tea, according to accounts by dozens of men. On the way
to the feeding area, the men had to run to avoid being beaten by
the Serbs _ some of them police and some of them regular prison
guards, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said, `Go to Bill clinton, he is protecting you,' and all
the time they were beating us,'' said Nexhat Kurti, 33, his jeans
so loose on his gaunt frame that they had to be tied in place with
a piece of string. His tank top did not disguise his sunken chest
and protuding ribs.
</P>
<P>
   At a refugee center in Kukes, the dazed men sat weakly in a tent
and lined up for a meal of milk, bread and a thick noodle soup _
the first real meal they had had in days or even longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If nobody helps Mitrovica, everybody there will be dead in a
couple of days,'' said Nexhat Kurti, another prisoner.
</P>
<P>
   The prison is the only instance that human rights workers have
heard of involving large groups of people incarcerated in Kosovo.
Most refugees have told stories of summary execution, or more often
of being harassed, robbed, beaten and forced to leave Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, as many as 500 of the former prisoners are struggling
over the border pass every day, human rights workers said. The men
arrive dehydrated and undernourished and must pass through a border
station that has become increasingly dangerous in the past weeks
amid NATO bombing and fighting between Serb forces and fighters of
the Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   Loud booms and massive billows of black smoke were visible from
Morina Monday as NATO bombed nearby areas of Kosovo while Serbs and
the KLA exchanged gunfire and shelling nearby.
</P>
<P>
   The imprisonment of the Albanian men ``seems to have a pretty
consistent pattern,'' said Joanne Mariner, a researcher and lawyer
for Human Rights Watch, a private organization. Typically, the men
were separated from women and children and taken to one of two
Serbs schools for processing. They were then hustled to Smrkovnica,
where they were held for five days to several weeks and subjected
to abuse and starvation the entire time, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point of it, supposedly, is to find out if they are UCK,''
she said, using the Albanian acronym for the KLA. The men were
forced to sign statements that they were ``terrorists'' in the
ethnic Albanian fighting force.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you didn't sign, you were beaten like a criminal,'' said a
man who refused to give his name.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Serb guards brought their children _ young as seven
years old _ to view the men, choose which would be beaten, and
sometimes beat the Albanians themselves, former prisoners reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``One policeman said to his son, `Which one do you want to beat?
Choose.' And he chose me,'' said Ibish Ibishi, 28. ``The policeman
beat me, and said to his son, `Is that enough?' The son said `no _
a little more.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``They are animals,'' Ibishi said, struggling to keep his
trousers up on his emaciated body.

 &HT;    Reeves' new game is close to his heart
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Dan Reeves will return this morning to Piedmont
Hospital's ``Intensive Care-Red,'' where last December he got a
second shot at living after quadruple-bypass heart surgery.
</P>
<P>
   This time, though, the Falcons coach will be the one playing
doctor. And he'll try not to cry.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he'll tour the intensive care unit where he stayed
after his Dec. 14 surgery and visit patients, including a man who
had open-heart surgery Monday and doesn't know Reeves is coming.
</P>
<P>
   Then Reeves and cardiologist Charles Brown will share the
coach's story.
</P>
<P>
   One-hundred fifty people will be allowed in the Richard H. Rich
Auditorium to listen to Reeves explain how he ignored early warning
signs last season and nearly waited too long to alert medical
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Titled, ``The Half-time show: Straight from the Heart,'' the
noon discussion will be the first of eight around the nation over
the next several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The tour is sponsored by a pharmaceutical company and a public
relations firm. Reeves hopes he can help others avoid some of the
mistakes he made.
</P>
<P>
   And he hopes he can avoid getting as upset as he was at his news
conference the day he was discharged Dec. 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it's not as emotional as it was when I checked out,''
said Reeves, who also will visit hospitals in Boston, Chicago,
Washington, Nashville, Los Angeles and Dallas. ``All I've got to do
is talk about my experience. For example, a lot of people don't do
anything even when they find out their cholesterol is high. ``Mine
was 214 the day I went in. I've got it down to 135 now with the
medications I take, exercise and improving my diet.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves, who was approached about this tour after speaking to
heart patients at a Miami hospital in February, also will hand out
a pamphlet titled, ``Crossing the Goal-line: Dan Reeves' Playbook
for Surviving Heart Disease.''
</P>
<P>
   He's become very mindful of the fact that, according to the
American Heart Association, some 58.8 million people suffer from
some sort of cardiovascular disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``Down there (in Miami), it was a really unique experience
because you realized that we all had shared the same thing,''
Reeves said. ``This can be very difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day after my surgery, at first it was amazing how much I
could do. I stood up and everything, but then just taking a shower
was so exhausting.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves still visits Brown about every two weeks, and he's
leading a largely normal life now _ if you don't count his diet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chocolate, I loved. Lots of salad dressing. Lots of butter on
my bread,'' he said, thinking of the old days. ``Doughnuts for
breakfest instead of cereal.''
</P>
<P>
   That's changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm surrounded in the office now by fruits in and out of
meetings,'' he said, not referring to his assistant coaches. ``I
rely more on the people around me and delegate more authority. The
message is when you suffer heart disease, your life is not over.''

LIFE AFTER TOCCA 
AND NOW, `OPRAH' 
A FASHIONABLE EYE
</HEADLINE>

   LIFE AFTER TOCCA
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There's a good reason Marie-Anne Oudejans named her
new line of clothes Loch-Ness Couture. ``I've always liked
monsters,'' said Ms. Oudejans, who will show her collection of 21
evening looks on Tuesday afternoon at Julian Schnabel's West
Village studio. ``It also sounds mysterious.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Oudejans, 34, is something of a mystery herself. A year ago,
she abruptly left Tocca, the fashion company whose sweet cotton
dresses established the Dutch-born Ms. Oudejans as a hip designer.
Tocca continued, but Ms. Oudejans seemed to drop from sight. ``To
be honest, when I left, it was personal,'' she said Monday,
explaining that instincts, more than anything, told her it was time
to move on. ``It's like a marriage: sometimes it's better to leave
before the relationship changes.'' Last December, Ms. Oudejans
said, she formally severed ties to Tocca, in which she was a
partner.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly a year of globe-trotting and option-weighing (she
briefly toyed with the idea of designing a hotel interior), Ms.
Oudejans and her current business partner, Daniel Spoor, approached
Kashiyama USA, a licensing company, about producing a line of
evening clothes. ``At our first meeting, I told them, `I'm ready
now, and we won't talk about Tocca,''' Ms. Oudejans said with a
laugh. Apparently, a lot of people have been wondering what she
planned to do for an encore.
</P>
<P>
   Loch-Ness is a departure. The dresses, which will be made in
Italy and priced from $1,000 to $4,000, are classic, with high
collars and open backs, with just enough flesh to keep a modern eye
focused. The colors are cloudlike: pale gray, pink and beige. Ms.
Oudejans plans to produce three collections annually; this one will
be in stores in October.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ouedejans is a little anxious about how retailers will
respond to gowns that conjure up a hot night in Rome _ or wherever
her nomadic customers land. ``You know, they're going to be shocked
because the collection is really different,'' she said. ``But it's
another stage in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   AND NOW, `OPRAH'
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Be honest: isn't there something marvelously nutty
about the prospect of Stefano Gabbana and Domenico Dolce _ the
Abbott and Costello of high fashion _ appearing on Oprah Winfrey's
show? The pair will be in Chicago next week to tape the show, to be
telecast on June 21.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, what the designers have calculated is Ms. Winfrey's
mainstream appeal. If she can do for their over-the-top fashion
what she's done for books, there's no telling how many women will
be phoning in, saying, ``Get me Dolce &AMP; Gabbana.''
</P>
<P>
   Reached by phone in Milan, where he and Dolce were working on
their spring men's wear collection, Gabbana said, ``We're very
aware that `Oprah' is one of the few vehicles to reach Middle
America.'' He added, with a laugh, ``I know what being on her show
can do for Dolce &AMP; Gabbana, yet, living in Italy, I don't think I
realize how huge it could be.''
</P>
<P>
   Not coincidentally _ surprise, surprise _ Messrs. Gabbana and
Dolce will be on television the day before their ``new best pop
star'' client, Whitney Houston, opens a tour. They've produced
about 15 different looks (in triplicate) for Ms. Houston, who met
with the designers 10 days ago and selected outfits from their fall
collection, though she also ordered a few of their signature
stretch gowns, which she will wear with brightly colored fur
chubbies.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, the designers dressed Madonna for a tour, but
``because of Whitney and Oprah together,'' Gabbana said, ``we'll
reach a different audience.''
</P>
<P>
   A FASHIONABLE EYE
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Kenneth Paul Block retrospective at the Society
of Illustrators Museum, 128 East 63rd St., brings to mind Yves
Saint Laurent's famous phrase about ``the silence of fashion'' _
clothes that don't need to call attention to themselves. Block's
drawings of the chic and restless of the 1970s and early 1980's
show women who knew how to wear clothes, not the other way around.
</P>
<P>
   A regular illustrator for Women's Wear Daily, Block has an eye
for fashion's absorbing little intimacies. In one drawing, he had
Diana Vreeland, Babe Paley and C.Z. Guest all wearing the same
Balenciaga coat. The show continues through June 26.

   WASHINGTON _ Struggling to rescue the imperiled Kosovo peace
process, President Clinton and his Russian counterpart Boris
Yeltsin ordered their top diplomats to try to craft a resolution on
the matter to go to the United Nations Security Council as early as
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The diplomats _ meeting with foreign ministers from other
so-called G-8 countries in Bonn _ spent eight hours hashing over
resolution language Monday and were scheduled to reconvene early
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to press the talks toward closure, Clinton called Yeltsin
to stress that peace is at hand and to ask for Moscow's help in
nailing down language for a Security Council resolution embracing
the peace accord Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic accepted last
Thursday but has yet to implement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very constructive call,'' White House spokesman Joe
Lockhart told reporters. He said the two leaders agreed to
authorize their top diplomats to work out their differences quickly
in Bonn and get the resolution before the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're trying to craft language for a U.N. Security Council
resolution that properly reflects the agreement that Milosevic has
accepted,'' said Mike Hammer, a spokesman at the White House for
the National Security Council. ``We think that will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Five days after agreeing to pull out his forces from Kosovo,
Milosevic, president of Yugoslavia, continued to balk at NATO's
terms for withdrawal on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials made good on their pledge to intensify their air
attacks, ramping up the sortie level to more than 200 strike
missions overnight Monday. They targeted radio relay towers, ammo
dumps and field forces from Kosovo northward into Serbia proper.
</P>
<P>
   After flying 93 strike sorties concentrating on Serb forces in
the field in Kosovo on Sunday, U.S. and allied pilots were
scheduled to fly ``two to three times'' that many overnight Monday,
said Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I anticipate that you'll see an intensification over the next
few days,'' Bacon told reporters at the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stay tuned,'' he said. ``Time will tell.''
</P>
<P>
   As NATO returned to an all-out war footing, diplomatic efforts
intensified in Bonn.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and his NATO allies were hopeful that U.N. adoption of
the resolution would clear the way for the continuation of talks
between NATO and Serb commanders over the withdrawal of all Serb
troops, police and paramilitary forces from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   High level talks over the pull-out broke down Sunday after Serb
officials rejected NATO's terms.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic spoke by telephone Monday with Finnish President
Martti Ahtisaari, who passed word to diplomats meeting in Germany
that the Serb leader intends to comply with the peace accord he
accepted last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Milosevic says he intends to go forward with the agreement,''
State Department spokesman James Rubin told reporters in Bonn,
where Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is leading U.S.
negotiations over the Security Council resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic agreed last Thursday to pull out Serb forces from
Kosovo and permit an international peacekeeping force to police the
war-torn province.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement called for that force, as well as a group of
civilian organizations, to operate inside Kosovo under U.N.
auspices. U.S. officials interpreted the breakdown of the military
talks to suggest that Milosevic wants to see the Security Council
resolution before making good on his pledge to withdraw Serb forces
from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't the sequence NATO had in mind last Thursday.
Instead, they anticipated a relatively quick Serb troop withdrawal,
followed by a NATO bombing halt and then a U.N. Security Council
resolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``The schedule has now been disturbed,'' Russian Foreign
Minister Igor Ivanov told reporters in Bonn. As a result, he said,
``wording of the resolution has become difficult, and we are
continuing to work on it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL ADD FOLLOWS &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Albright and Ivanov met for eight hours Monday in Bonn with
their six counterparts from Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy
and Japan _ the so-called Group of Eight major democratic powers _
to try to hammer out language for a 20-point Security Council
resolution. Talks were scheduled to resume early Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have managed to solve 17,'' of the issues, said German
Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer. ``We do hope that we will clear
those (remaining) points tomorrow, so that we can get a
constructive work to the Security Council and that we can take a
decision in the Security Council.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the outstanding issues was whether to stipulate in the
resolution that the peacekeeping force would be led by NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Russia is opposed to that. Russians share close historical and
cultural ties with their Slavic kin, the Serbs, and have tried to
back Milosevic's demands for a watered-down U.N. security force
that would be largely unarmed.
</P>
<P>
   NATO, however, has insisted that the force be a robust combat
contingent led by the trans-Atlantic alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 48,000 troops anticipated to make up the force, NATO
countries have pledged 44,000 troops. Another 4,000 have been
pledged by NATO partner countries.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops are also anticipated, but Moscow has not yet
pledged forces.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials reiterated Monday that the force would be
NATO-led.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not negotiable,'' said Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't certain, though, that NATO leadership would be
stipulated in the Security Council resolution. In essence, Russia
seeks ambiguity while the United States would prefer specificity.
Compromise language was seen as likely.
</P>
<P>
   A second issue was how to deal with the matter of Milosevic's
indictment by the U.N. war crimes tribunal. No mention of his
indictment was included in last Thursday's agreement. Some NATO
members reportedly were pressing for explicit mention in the
Security Council resolution, and Russia was balking.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials declined to confirm the third area of outstanding
disagreement.
</P>
<P>
   Low level communications continued Monday between Serb and NATO
commanders, but those talks were well below the decision-making
level, said Bacon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's primarily just to keep the phone lines open and the tea
water warm,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how soon NATO's bombing might end, Bacon reiterated that
it depends on how quickly Serb forces withdraw from Kosovo, a
matter that remains out of NATO's hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think predictions are worth the paper they're printed
on,'' said Bacon. ``At this stage, we just don't know.''

<P>
   COLOGNE, Germany _ After eight hours of negotiations, Russia
balked Monday at final approval of a resolution to be sent to the
United Nations Security Council to lay out the future of Kosovo and
the role of 50,000 NATO peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   Russia does not want any of its troops to be under the control
of NATO, and insists that the United Nations have some role in the
peacekeeping.
</P>
<P>
   In other areas considerable progress was made, and the latest
stumbling blocks may be quickly resolved. Secretary General Kofi
Annan said at the United Nations on Monday night that he expected
the foreign ministers to agree on a resolution by Wednesday, and
expressed the hope that the Security Council would adopt it within
24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should then move on with the troops,'' Annan said.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiators, especially Russia and the Europeans, want the
Security Council to approve such a resolution detailing the sketchy
document that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic agreed to last
week, which called for a U.N. role. The resolution is also meant to
give authority to the peacekeeping force and the civil
administration that is planned for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, said he needed to
have further consultations with Moscow. The Russians, through their
emissary Viktor Chermonyrdin, helped secure the agreement last
week. But if they change their mind and block a NATO dominated
force, under U.N. authority, that would be a setback to the peace
effort.
</P>
<P>
   Military talks in Macedonia all but collapsed over the weekend,
and Monday were downgraded to low level officials.NATO had promised
to intensify its air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   NATO at first held back on carrying out threats to intensify its
bombing. Allied officials said they hoped that the restraint would
help persuade Russia to back the Security Council resolution.
</P>
<P>
   But there was NATO bombing in Kosovo near the Albanian border,
and at night, explosions and anti-aircraft fire were heard once
again in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   At the military talks, Yugoslavia asked to keep 15,000 of its
forces in Kosovo, an idea that the State Department rejected as
unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   A senior administration official insisted that the draft
resolution satisifed the longstanding NATO demand that the
peacekeeping force have NATO ``at the core.'' The official said
that ``we're going to have unified command and control'' under
NATO, endorsed by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic was told by Chernomyrdin and the Finnish President
Maarti Ahtisaari, that the phrase ``substantial NATO
participation'' in the document he agreed to last Thursday meant
``unified command and control,'' by NATO, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   The question of Russian participation in the peacekeeping force
still remained unresolved. Moscow has said it will not allow its
soldiers to work under a NATO command.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's accord with President Slobodan Milosevic of
Yugoslavia calls for all Yugoslav and Serbian police and military
to leave Kosovo. But Milosevic's troops appeared to be playing for
time in a last ditch effort ot drive ethnic Albanian guerrillas
from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The stalling by the Russians and the refusal by the Yugoslavs to
negotiate seriously on the withdrawal left an uncertain atmosphere
over how and when the Kosovo plan would move forward.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Germany's defense minister, Rudfolf Scharping, described the
situation as ``very precarious'' Monday morning
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to propel the process forward, President Clinton
spoke by telephone with President Boris Yeltsin of Russia. As well,
the Finnish negotiator, Ahtisaari, who helped secure the accord
with Milosevic, flew to China Monday on a mission to convince the
Chinese not to block the Security Council resolution on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   And despite the lack of cooperation by the Russians on final
agreement of the draft, the foreign ministers reported that
considerable progress was made on major details.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the foreign ministers, including Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright, decided that the civilian leader of
Kosovo would be a special representative of the secretary-general
of the United Nations, chosen by the secretary general, State
Department spokesman James Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   The draft resolution was informally circulated among members of
the Security Council in New York on Monday afternoon, Western
diplomats said here.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanov promised to rejoin the other foreign ministers, who are
convening here under the auspices of the G-8 _ the seven richest
industrial countries and Russia _ on Tuesday morning for another
session. If the Russian said yes to the draft, the resolution could
be considered by the Security Council as early as Tuesday afternoon
in New York, officials here said.
</P>
<P>
   In a best case scenario, a Clinton administration official
traveling with Albright said Monday night that the momentum of the
security council resolution could put pressure on the Yugsolavs to
come to an arrangement with NATO for the withdrawal of their
troops.
</P>
<P>
   Once the withdrawal began, NATO would consider a suspension of
the bombing. These steps, one following the other, were described
by French officials as ``synchronization.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials said they had no quarrel with
the French notion. ``I would expect all this to happen relatively
quickly,'' an administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials here said they were satisfied that the
draft resolution made clear that the peacekeeping force of 50,000
will have a unified NATO command and control structure. The word
NATO may not be spelled out in the resolution, an official said,
but one section of the draft says that the operation will be
``performed by member states and relevant international
organizations.''
</P>
<P>
   The Russians have insisted that the United Nations have some say
in the peacekeeping operation and it appeared, the official said,
that this demand could be satisfied by the supreme commander of
NATO, Gen. Wesley Clark, making a written report to the United
Nations Security Council over specific periods.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have already crossed the Rubicon that it will not be run by
the United Nations,'' the State Department spokesman, Rubin, said
of the peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow is unwilling to have its troops work under a NATO
command.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has made clear that it would be happy
for Russian soldiers to participate in the peacekeeping force under
the same arrangements that prevail in Bosnia. There, the Russians
report to an American commander who is not the chief NATO commander
in that force. ``We'd like to see them participate,'' Rubin said
Sunday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. ADDITIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The draft Security Council resolution, which has been a work in
progress for many weeks and was fine tuned paragraph by paragraph
Monday by the foreign ministers, laid out the responsibilities of
both the peacekeepers and the civil administration, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The list of duties of the peacekeepers included enforcing a
ceasefire, ensuring the withdrawal of Yugoslav and Serbian forces,
securing the return of the ethnic Albanian refugees, taking out the
mines placed by the Serb forces and preventing the return of those
forces.
</P>
<P>
   The peacekeeping force, which will be dominated by European
soldiers and include 7,000 Americans, as well as soldiers from
non-NATO countries, would also patrol the borders, the draft
resolution says.
</P>
<P>
   The responsibilities of the civil administrator chosen by the
United Nations secretary general will include organizing elections
and policing operations. Under the terms of the agreement with
Milosevic, the Kosovo Liberation Army, is called on to disarm. That
agreement does not spell out what the ex-guerrillas would do, but
officials working on the Security Council resolution said they
would be encouraged to help form a new police corps.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear whether the draft resolution dealt with new
documentation for returning refugees, many of whom had their
identification papers, passports, educational certificates and car
licenses taken from them when they were forced out by the Serbs.
But the new civil administration would have to deal with this
question as well as physical reconstruction of the burned homes and
properties.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution also dealt with compliance required with the war
crimes tribunal in The Hague by the new authorities in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the European Union, Niko Wegter, said that
Russia had objected to the wording of the provision on the
tribunal. Milosevic, and four of his top aides including those who
ran operations in Kosovo, were indicted by the tribunal nearly two
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that because the plan agreed to by Milosevic
called for kosovo to be cleared of all Serbian and Yugoslav forces
and paramilitaries, the question of the arrest of indicted
officials _ like Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic who remained in
Bosnia after the peace agreement _ was unlikely to arise.
</P>
<P>
   But asked if the peacekeeping force would have the mandate to
arrest indicted Serb and Yugoslav officials, a senior
administration official said he would not speculate.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the planning on the resolution, there was still
nervousness among the foreign ministers' delegations about whether
Milosevic would give clear orders to his generals to move their
troops out of Kosovo or whether, even under NATO bombing, he would
chip away at the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Ahtisaari visited the foreign ministers Monday morning before
leaving for China and told them to move rapidly on finalizing the
United Nations council resolution, which is specifically called for
in the document that Milosevic agreed to.
</P>
<P>
   The Finnish president also told the gathering he had spoken to
Milosevic Monday and was told by the Yugoslav leader that he
intended to abide by the plan he agreed to last week, an
administration official said.

ADVERTISING COLUMN: A SALES BONANZA FOR PRIME TIME
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Calif., Wash.)   (jw) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   What's the hottest phenomenon on television today? For the
public, it might well be a hit show like ``Ally McBeal'' or ``Buffy
the Vampire Slayer,'' but for the broadcast networks, it is
something more fleeting: those brief interludes known as commercial
time.
</P>
<P>
   In a frantic period of negotiations, the sale of prime-time
commercial slots for the fall season _ known as the up-front market
_ is exceeding even the most optimistic forecasts made by top
television executives as recently as last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been an extraordinary up-front this year,'' said David
Verklin, chief executive at the Carat North America media services
agency in New York, a unit of Aegis Group PLC that buys advertising
for marketers. ``If you blinked your eyes, you missed it.''
</P>
<P>
   Network and advertising executives are projecting that up-front
sales by the six networks _ ABC, CBS, the Fox Broadcasting Company,
NBC, UPN and WB _ will climb at least 13 percent, to $7.25 billion,
from about $6.4 billion last year. Only a few weeks ago, they were
estimating a more moderate increase to a range of $6.8 billion to
$7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   And broadcasters are enjoying increased sales for daytime, news
and late-night programs as well as for prime-time shows. Add the
revenue from those spots to the prime-time take and the total
up-front take could reach $10 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew there was a lot of money out there, but not that
much,'' said Paul Schulman, president of Schulman/Advanswers NY, a
media services agency in New York owned by the Omnicom Group.
</P>
<P>
   Better yet, the rivulet of advertising money from all those hot
Internet companies that have gone public lately could soon become a
flood, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   The advertising bonanza, fueled by a strong economy and a rush
by marketers to the medium that remains the quickest and surest
route to consumers' wallets, is confounding a longstanding
assumption that broadcast television is in an irreversible decline
as cable TV steals market share.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dollars pouring in surprised both the networks and the
advertisers,'' said Peter Chrisanthopoulos, president for broadcast
and programming in the United States at Ogilvy &AMP; Mather Worldwide
in New York, the giant agency owned by WPP Group PLC.
</P>
<P>
   It is, after all, a paradox: the broadcast networks' raking in
more money than ever even as they deliver fewer eyeballs to
advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998-99 season brought all-time low Nielsen ratings as only
one of the six broadcast networks, WB, owned by Time Warner Inc.
and the Tribune Co., attracted a larger audience than in 1997-98.
In the last five years, the audience share for the broadcast
networks has declined to 55 percent from 69 percent as cable
television draws more Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting that, the cable up-front market, now under way, is on
fire. There are estimates that the cable networks will sell $3.6
billion to $3.8 billion worth of commercial time ahead of their
1999-2000 season, compared with $2.8 billion for the 1998-99
season.
</P>
<P>
   So why the sudden surge in advertising dollars? There are a lot
of factors, but two stand out: the economy, and the power of being
No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   America's eight-year economic expansion, the second longest on
record, is one of the wonders of the 1990s. It has been largely
fueled by consumer spending, and that means, of course, that
companies have a powerful motivation to increase their advertising
budgets.
</P>
<P>
   And through it all, for all the audience losses, all the
defections to cable and the Internet, all the problems of broadcast
television, there remains the salient fact that television is still
the most powerful influence on consumer behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``Television in general is the most impactful medium, the medium
that can sell clients' products best,'' Chrisanthopoulos at Ogilvy
&AMP; Mather said. ``The sight, the sound, the motion, the ubiquitous
nature of it makes it the most integral part of most clients' media
plans.''
</P>
<P>
   Broadcast TV can still command huge audiences, even if they are
smaller than in the days when Desi loved Lucy, Archie loved Edith
and Sam loved Diane. And those audiences are much larger than those
commanded by any cable network.
</P>
<P>
   In a fractionalized media market, audience size is relative,
according to Verklin of Carat North America.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the land of dwarfs,'' as he put it, ``the 5-foot guy is the
center of the basketball team.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, about 127.5 million Americans saw Super Bowl
XXXIII on Fox in January. About 78 million people watched at least
part of the Academy Awards broadcast on ABC in March. And last
month, when the sitcom ``Home Improvement'' presented its series
finale, 35.5 million viewers came to watch ABC.
</P>
<P>
   That means that marketers both in traditional categories like
automobiles, financial services and retailing, and in booming
industries like telecommunications, computers and
electronic-commerce need to keep peddling their wares on the
broadcast networks. Indeed, advertising revenues, adjusted for
inflation, have been fairly strong in the last three years after
more than a decade of stagnation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to get to the mass audience,'' Schulman said,
broadcast TV ``is where you have to be.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For anybody introducing anything who has to lasso audience in
a hurry _ a new product, a new campaign, a new movie _ the networks
are still the biggest show in town,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Those sentiments are, of course. music to the ears of the sales
executives at the broadcast networks. They prize their ability to
reach broader audiences than most cable networks, which appeal to
narrower audiences with their focus on subjects like sports, news
and weather.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always a concern when your audience is eroded,'' said
Randy Falco, president of the NBC-TV Network unit of NBC in New
York, part of General Electric Co., but ``to get through to
America, you have to come through the networks.''
</P>
<P>
   The sizzling up-front market shows that broadcast TV ``is still
working,'' he added. ``That's the message.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, broadcasters are scheduling additional series this fall
aimed at the younger audiences that advertisers crave, filled with
teen-agers and 20-somethings whose looks are easy on the eyes and
whose plot lines will no doubt be easy on the mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a major crisis,'' said Bob Igiel, president for the
broadcast division of the Media Edge in New York, the media
services arm of the agency company Young &AMP; Rubicam Inc. ``There
isn't a kid left in high school in Los Angeles; they're all doing
TV shows.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, networks also have to cope with rising costs for
programs. Moreover, it is almost impossible to calculate the impact
of the surge in advertising on the profits or stock prices of the
networks' owners because they are generally huge conglomerates,
like GE or the Walt Disney Co., the parent of ABC, that have so
many other sources of revenue.
</P>
<P>
   And the networks are not just sitting back and enjoying the
advertising windfall, either. ``The lesson for all of us'' in the
shrinking audience shares, said Falco of the NBC-TV Network, ``is
that you can't stand still.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why NBC is ``embracing'' the Internet, he added, with
services like Snap.com; investing in cable networks like MSNBC, a
joint venture with the Microsoft Corp., and ``starting the process
of cross-selling'' among its older and newer media properties.
</P>
<P>
   For ABC, the answer to ``how you stop erosion'' is ``to get the
viewer more interested,'' said Marv Goldsmith, president for sales
and marketing at the ABC Television Network unit of ABC in New
York. That includes a presence on the Internet, with the Go
Network, he added, as well as this self-evident strategy: ``You put
on better programs. It's as simple as that.''
</P>
<P>
   That is, needless to tell anyone who sat through the many lame
sitcoms, violent ``reality'' programs and soporific dramas that
characterized the 1998-99 season, easier said than done.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see any tremendously exciting things the networks are
doing to justify this,'' said Gene DeWitt, president and chief
executive of DeWitt Media in New York, a media services agency,
referring to the higher prices in the up-front market. ``It's not
like there's great new programming to get more audience.''
</P>
<P>
   It all depends on how you define ``great,'' of course. DeWitt
predicted that the six networks' erosion in audience would slow to
a 3 percent decline in the coming season from a 7 percent loss in
1998-99.
</P>
<P>
   And the reason? Dewitt anticipates that a two-hour weekly
wrestling series to be added to the prime-time schedule of UPN, the
low-rated network owned by Chris-Craft Industries and Viacom Inc.,
will lure viewers from the hugely popular wrestling shows on cable
networks.
</P>
<P>
   But as a TV industry saying proclaims, at this point in a new
season, every show is a hit.
</P>
<P>
   And at this point, too, another saying comes into play: Success
begets success. Almost nobody thinks the advertising bonanza will
reverse itself anytime soon, barring a recession.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's still a significant amount of money to come,'' said
David Poltrack, executive vice president for research and planning
at CBS Television in New York, part of CBS Corp., to be spent after
the 1999-2000 season starts by ``the new part of the advertising
marketplace,'' particularly the so-called dot-com advertisers like
E-commerce Web sites and other Internet marketers.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, it is a time for celebration on broadcast row. ``We
all thought it was going to be a very, very strong marketplace,''
said Jon Nesvig, president for sales at Fox in New York, part of
News Corp., ``but it was much stronger than either side thought it
would be.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Nesvig had a one-word response when asked how
broadcasters fared in the up-front: ``Phew!'' as in relief at not
losing sales because of a shrinking audience.
</P>
<P>
   Reminded of that last week, he replied, laughing, ``This year,
maybe it's a `Wow!'''

GOLDMAN, MERRILL LYNCH JOIN IN ALTERNATIVE TRADING SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a deal indicating that even the largest Wall
Street firms are unsure how or where stocks will be traded in the
not so distant future, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Merrill Lynch &AMP;
Co. announced Monday that they had joined with Bernard L. Madoff
Investment Securities, a large stock trading firm, to form Primex
Trading NA, an alternative stock trading system.
</P>
<P>
   The company will offer electronic access to investors interested
in trading stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange, the
American Stock Exchange and NASDAQ. Primex is expected to begin
operations a year from now, at roughly the same time stocks begin
being priced in decimals rather than fractions.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are hoping to do is create an electronic extension of
a pure auction securities market trading on a physical floor by
expanding participation to a broad-based electronic crowd,'' said
Peter Madoff, a senior managing director at Madoff Investment
Securities. In an auction market, like the Big Board, all orders
for a particular stock are handled by one trader, known as a
specialist, who must execute the trades as well as maintain a fair
and orderly market in the shares. A dealer market, like NASDAQ, has
multiple traders, known as market makers, executing customer orders
in many places.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for Primex said it would differ from other alternative
systems, known as electronic communications networks, or ECNs,
because Primex would be more than just a place for investors to
meet to execute trades at prices they have specified. Rather it
will allow investors to receive prices on their trades that are
superior to the current best bid or offer made by specialists or
market makers.
</P>
<P>
   Primex will do this by guaranteeing that its customers get the
best current price for their trades while allowing them to state
how much more they would ideally like to receive for the stock they
are selling or how much less they'd like to pay if they could. If
another Primex customer were willing to pay more for the trade or
sell the stock for less, the client initiating the trade would
benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Primex will be accessible to brokerage firms, institutional
investors, market makers and exchange specialists. The entry of
orders will be anonymous; the cost of participation in the system
has not yet been disclosed. But if the system attracts a sizable
clientele, it will be likely to reduce the difference between the
bid and asked prices on stocks, known as the spread.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an element of uncertainty in the marketplace,'' said
Jonathan Humphreys, a Merrill Lynch spokesman. ``And we're looking
at those innovations that we believe can achieve a critical mass
and will position us better to serve our clients.'' Terms of the
deal were not disclosed.

WITNESSES DENY ASTROS OWNER MADE OFFENSIVE REMARKS ABOUT HISPANICS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN WILLIAMS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Three participants denied Monday that Houston Astros
owner Drayton McLane Jr. made offensive remarks about Hispanics
last week.
</P>
<P>
   The three said they participated in all or part of McLane's
conversation with executives of a Spanish-language television
station that erupted into controversy.
</P>
<P>
   KTDM-Channel 48 Telemundo reported that McLane had told its
General Manager Marco Camacho on Thursday night that the Astros
don't market Hispanics better because they don't understand the
game, among several alleged slights.
</P>
<P>
   But advertising buyer Ron Lucas and his wife, Lori, said they
were present for all of the conversation and that Camacho and his
two executives misinterpreted it.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Lucas said Camacho took the remarks ``totally out of
context'' because McLane was talking generally about his problems
marketing baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only reason that conversation was talking about Hispanics
is he was talking with Hispanics from an Hispanic broadcasting
station,'' Ron Lucas said. ``I think he felt the same way about
Anglos, African-Americans and Asian-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I want to say this, and maybe I'm hedging my bet. Everyone
has a right to hear what they want to hear. But as an Anglo, I
didn't hear (McLane say) that.''
</P>
<P>
   Advertising consultant Tami Weitkunat said Camacho
misrepresented the portion of the conversation she heard.
</P>
<P>
   According to Camacho, McLane had said the Astros don't market to
Hispanics because they buy cheap tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Weitkunat said, McLane was responding to a question
about the high cost of attending sporting events by pointing out
that the Astros have $2 seats.
</P>
<P>
   Lori Lucas and Weitkunat said they complained to Camacho later
in the evening when they heard he might broadcast what they called
McLane's misinterpreted statements.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got into a heated argument and we said, `That is not what
was said,''' Weitkunat said.
</P>
<P>
   She said she declined Camacho's request to verify the station's
report.
</P>
<P>
   Camacho would not comment Monday, but KTMD spokeswoman Cassandra
Castellano said the station stands by its story.
</P>
<P>
   ``People may think this is public relations, a stunt for public
relations or self-aggrandizement, but it is not, not at all,''
Castellano said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could be a function of two perspectives, or two cultural
perspectives. Maybe what is offensive to one race is not offensive
to someone else of a different perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   Castellano said Camacho had called Ron Lucas on Friday to make
sure he verified the report and would not mind if the station
referred reporters to him. Lucas affirmed that what KTMD had
reported was accurate, Castellano said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, she said, Camacho used Lucas as a reference later
Friday when he confronted McLane at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   But Lucas said Camacho was not specific in their conversation
about what he was alleging of McLane. Not until he returned from a
trip did he learn the full extent of what Camacho was saying, Lucas
said.
</P>
<P>
   McLane has said his comments were taken out of context.
</P>
<P>
   The alleged comments came during a Houston Advertising
Federation banquet Thursday night at the downtown Aerial Theater.
McLane was there to receive the federation's Trailblazer Award.
</P>
<P>
   Camacho had said Friday that after his and two other station
executives' conversation with McLane, they huddled to make sure
each had the same impression of McLane's comments.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Lucas, a guest of Camacho's at a Telemundo table at the
banquet, said he was a little hesitant to come public with his
views because he works for Boone-DeLeon, a Hispanic firm that does
business with Telemundo but does not do business with the Astros.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas said he is worried that his company could lose business as
a result of his speaking out.
</P>
<P>
   ``This pains me; I just know there will be repercussions,'' he
said. ``I wish it weren't the case, but I feel that it's the right
thing to (tell what happened.)''
</P>
<P>
   Lucas, speaking for himself and his wife, said McLane never
stated that Hispanics are not smart enough to understand baseball.
</P>
<P>
   On McLane's allegedly saying the Astros don't market Hispanics
because they only buy cheap seats, Lucas voiced a similar story as
Weitkunat.
</P>
<P>
   On the allegation that McLane said Hispanics can't follow
baseball because they can't read newspapers, Lucas said McLane made
a different observation.
</P>
<P>
   McLane stated that baseball must be followed on a daily basis
and that fans must stay abreast of statistics, but that Hispanic
newspapers don't carry such statistics, Lucas said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't take it that Hispanics don't read the newspaper, it's
just that their newspapers don't carry the statistics and box
scores,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with El Dia, Houston's Spanish-language daily
newspaper, said it prints the box scores (statistical
interpretations of a baseball game) about once a week. El Dia
doesn't have enough space to run them daily, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of whose interpretation of McLane's comments is
correct, the issue remained a hot topic in the Hispanic community.
</P>
<P>
   Spanish-speaking KQQK radio was again flooded with callers
Monday, but instead of being angry as they were Friday, many were
laughing about the situation, said talk show host Beau Corona.
</P>
<P>
   Listeners played a game about ``Drayton McLane's Dictionary,''
making up definitions one might find in McLane's personal
dictionary.
</P>
<P>
   For example, one caller described an RBI (runs batted in) as
``Real Bad Indigestion,'' a lampoon of McLane's alleged suggestions
that Hispanics don't like Astrodome food.
</P>
<P>
   Another said McLane believes a shortstop ``is the shortest
player on the team.'' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; ``The remarks are still in the back of their minds,'' Corona
said. ``We still love the Astros, and we're going to go out there
and support the Astros.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe he said it, maybe he didn't. The truth probably lies
somewhere in between.''

SILVER REVISES HIS OFFER TO CUT SPENDING DEMAND
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Last week's apparent progress toward a state
budget evaporated Monday as Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver
appeared to retract his offer to cut his house's spending demands
by as much as $2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, seized
on Silver's offer of last week and said the two houses should
immediately convene a conference committee to work out a detailed
budget, a move the speaker has been demanding for months.
</P>
<P>
   But Silver responded that his lowered spending figure was not
addressed to Bruno. Rather, he said, it was an offer to Gov. George
Pataki, a Republican, that the Democrats would lower their demands
in exchange for the governor's pledge not to veto significant
portions of the Legislature's budget. The governor has refused to
make such a promise, so Silver said the Democrats are back at their
earlier, higher figure.
</P>
<P>
   However, in a lengthy news conference on Thursday, when he made
his concessions public, Silver never said his house's decreased
spending demand was contingent on a no-veto promise, and it was not
taken that way by the Governor's office, other legislators or
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker's comments Monday dashed the hopes he raised last
week of completing a budget by June 16, when this year's
legislative session is scheduled to end. The budget will be 69 days
overdue on Tuesday, tying the mark for the third-latest in state
history.
</P>
<P>
   Silver's remarks on Thursday were apparently a feint intended to
draw Pataki into the process. It failed. The governor has insisted
all year that once he proposed his $72.7 billion budget, it was up
to the Legislature to act, and he would play no role in
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are looking for a way to avoid a repetition of last
year, when Pataki vetoed $1.6 billion in spending and borrowing
approved by the Legislature, the vast majority of it in projects
and programs championed by Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Bruno publicly invited Silver to convene conference
committees this afternoon, ``using his numbers'' of last week.
</P>
<P>
   But Silver said: ``I didn't make that offer to him. I made that
offer to the governor. The governor has not indicated an
acceptance.'' The overture to Pataki, he said, was in return for
``his not vetoing the items in the overall plan.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate leader ``is attempting to lay a veto trap for the
Governor,'' the speaker charged. ``He probably has a deal with the
Governor: veto the Assembly items, not the Senate items.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruno said there was no such deal. He accused Silver of trying
to return to the pre-1998 practice of the governor and legislative
leaders negotiating the budget in private meetings, a system often
derided as secretive and undemocratic. ``He doesn't want to go to
conference committees,'' he said. ``That's clear now, isn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic officials said Silver had an eye on the June 30
expiration of $1 billion a year in Medicaid spending cuts that were
enacted in 1995 and 1996. Pataki wants to keep the cuts in place,
so the Speaker, his allies say, believes that he gains leverage by
pushing closer to that deadline.
</P>
<P>
   The governor has said he wants to keep the overall increase in
state spending within the inflation rate. To do that, he would cut
health care and higher education spending, and eliminate the
state's two-year-old commitment to paying for prekindergarten and
full-day kindergarten classes in every community, and reduced class
sizes in the early grades. Pataki has also called for salting away
all of the state's $2 billion surplus to pay for future tax cuts,
rather than spending the money.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Republicans have proposed a budget $1.1 billion
larger than the governor's, a number that Pataki has said is too
high.
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly Democrats' original plan was $2 billion to $4
billion above the Governor's, depending on whose interpretation one
uses. But last week, Silver said he was willing to drop to $1.1
billion to $1.5 billion above Pataki's figure, the same range as
the Senate set.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took Shelly Silver four months to get to $1.1 billion, and
now he's reneging on that number,'' said Charles Deister, a
spokesman for Pataki. ``It's now clear as a bell that he wants to
drag out the budget process as long as possible for his own
political purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   The Speaker's retreat Monday puts the Legislature back in the
bind it has been in for three months. Bruno says that the two
houses must agree on an overall spending figure, or at least be
close to agreement, before a conference committee can begin. Silver
says that the question of an overall figure could be the first
thing decided by the committee, and that the panel should convene
right away.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ It takes courage to open a designer boutique on
Madison Avenue that doesn't have a recognizable name. It takes even
more courage if the name belongs to a dead designer who won't be
around to charm potential customers. But Elisa Salinas, who is
opening the Enrique Martinez boutique in the fall at Madison Avenue
and 67th Street, doesn't seem the slightest bit daunted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I produce soap operas,'' she said last week on a trip from
Mexico City, her home. ``Every time I make a decision about a soap
opera, it's $5 million. I produce 10 soap operas. My business in
Mexico is $50 million. I'm used to big numbers and taking big
risks. I think the risk is worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   Old hands of the New York retail scene, who see boutiques
opening and closing with regularity, might consider her naive, if
not foolhardy. But though she won't say what it is costing her to
set up the Enrique Martinez business, it's nowhere near the $5
million it costs her to get a soap opera on the air. She sells soap
operas to stations all over the world and considers it her mission
to make Mexican fashion stand for more than peasant wedding shirts
and huaraches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very concerned about Mexico,'' Ms. Salinas said. ``It has
no image in this country. Can you think of one Mexican designer?
No. Nobody is willing to take the risk, so I decided to take it.''
</P>
<P>
   She may be chauvinistic about her country, but she is not naive.
She's a world traveler who speaks fluent English, went to school in
France and has been coming to New York since she was 5, first with
her parents and in recent years with her husband, Juan Davide
Burns, and their three young daughters. She was at last week's
American Fashion Awards, drawing attention in a backless white
dress by Vera Wang and an impressive diamond solitaire as she
presided over a table beside the stage.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Salinas has been involved in the business world since she
was 17 (she's now 33). She owned 32 shoe stores in Mexico and a
chain of 24-hour supermarkets, she said, before her family bought
control of the Television Azteca network for $641 million in 1993.
``That changed my life,'' she said. She sold the stores and went
into television. She is vice president of television production for
the network and intends to remain so while running the Enrique
Martinez business. Her entrepreneurial spirit comes from her
father, Hugo Salinas Rocha.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father was a self-made man with everything from TV networks
to 800 retail stores all over Latin America,'' said Ms. Salinas,
who is not related to the former Mexican President, Carlos Salinas
de Gortari. ``He was the cliche of the tycoon,'' she added. ``But
he started to lose his eyesight when I was about 17, and I started
working for him. I went with him to see business executives and
bankers and learned how to read financial statements. When I
decided to go into the retail business myself when I was 19, I went
for shoes. My father said, `There are 90 million Mexicans walking,
and they all need shoes.' My shoes sold for $1 to $5, so everyone
could afford them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Enrique Martinez clothes are not for everyone, ranging in
price from $500 to about $2,500. But Ms. Salinas and the executive
director of her company, Sandra Seroy, whose fashion experience
includes stints at Max Mara and Genny, believe that classic styles
in fine fabrics will appeal to women who shop on Madison Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel our customer is a very active woman,'' Ms. Salinas
said. ``She's very self-confident and feminine. She may be a
professional and powerful, but she has a great appreciation for the
feminine side. The clothes are not androgynous at all. I believe
clothes can be useful and comfortable and can help you look chic,
no matter if you've been in an office for 10 hours and then go to
cocktails.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Salinas could be describing herself.
</P>
<P>
   Except for slinky jersey evening dresses, the Enrique Martinez
clothes are the kind a woman could wear all day. There are suits,
blazers, coats, simple shift dresses and knits, all made in Italy
of fine Italian wools and cashmere, often with a touch of stretch.
They come in black, browns and dark red as well as checks of
russet, green and beige. Sweaters are in 12 colors.
</P>
<P>
   There are double-breasted blazers, shaped jackets and a
zip-front collarless style; slim knee-length skirts, and narrow
pants. Some of the jackets for fall have beaver or fox collars,
which add an aura of luxury. There will also be cashmere and
pashmina shawls and scarves.
</P>
<P>
   ``The clothes are not trendy,'' Ms. Salinas stressed. ``That's
not what we're looking for. The concept is casual haute couture.
There will be very few pieces of each style, and a woman can order
something in another fabric. And we will offer custom-designed
evening wear.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez designed about 75 percent of the fall collection before
he died last November. There is now a design team headed by Georges
Zeldis, who has worked in Europe for Valentino and Anna Molinari.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds odd to name a new business for a dead designer,
especially one whose name is not known outside his native Mexico,
but Ms. Salinas was committed to honoring him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enrique came to Mexico City from a small town when he was
17,'' she recalled. ``He went to work for Manuel Mendez, who was a
very important designer in Mexico then. My mother was a client. I
was 6 when I met Enrique. He taught me how to wear lipstick, how to
dress. He was a mentor, the eldest brother I didn't have.''

   Martinez worked in Paris before opening his own custom salon in
Mexico City, where Ms. Salinas' mother bought clothes. Ms. Salinas,
who is tall, and striking, modeled for him when she was only 14.
</P>
<P>
   She recalled being in New York with Martinez early last year,
walking along Madison Avenue, when they started talking about
starting a business here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like playing, talking between friends,'' Ms. Salinas
said. ``Then it went on, and I thought, This could be a reality. I
made the decision in March last year, and Enrique agreed to close
his business and work with me. I think Enrique lives in this
project and is here with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Salinas' commitment involved signing a 10-year lease, with
an additional five-year option, for a two-story retail space at 785
Madison Ave. She won't disclose the annual rent except to say it is
in the high six figures _ not unusual today. Because of the demand
for Madison Avenue retail space, it has become a landlords' market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Landlords want names, someone with 50 global stores,'' Ms.
Seroy said. ``We were in negotiations for months. But Ms. Salinas
is not accustomed to have anyone say no.''
</P>
<P>
   As someone who manages 2,000 employees in her television
production company, Ms. Salinas operates on a large scale. Running
just one boutique on Madison Avenue would not be worth the
investment of her time or her finances, she said. The boutique is
meant to be the first step in establishing an Enrique Martinez
brand name, so there are plans for more boutiques in this country
and to wholesale the line, perhaps as early as next year, to a few
high-end stores.

<P>
   Louis Guirandou-N'Diaye, a member of the International Olympic
Committee from the Ivory Coast in West Africa, who was censured for
inappropriate behavior during the Salt Lake City bribery scandal,
died Friday. He was 76.
</P>
<P>
   Guirandou-N'Diaye, who had suffered from intestinal problems,
died after a reaction to something he ate, according to an IOC
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   A member of the Olympic committee since 1969, Guirandou-N'Diaye
served as its second-ranking member, or first vice president, from
1980 to 1984. Juan Antonio Samaranch, who had just assumed
presidency of the organization, relied on Guirandou-N'Diaye and
others to help restore African participation in the Summer Games,
after a boycott of the 1976 Montreal Olympics over the issue of
apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   Guirandou-N'Diaye also served as president of the Ivory Coast
Olympic Committee for 31 years and as an ambassador. He was an
influential figure in international judo.
</P>
<P>
   Ten IOC delegates were expelled or resigned during the bribery
scandal linked to Salt Lake City's bid to acquire the 2002 Winter
Games. Guirandou-N'Diaye received a warning for accepting gifts
over the allowable limit and for allowing Salt Lake City officials
to pay for his wife's flight to Budapest in June 1995 for the vote
to award the 2002 Winter Games. &QL;

NORTEL IS READY TO FIRE NEW SALVO IN INTERNET TELEPHONY WAR
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Canada)   (jw) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Nortel Networks Corp. of Canada, in the battle to transmit
phone calls using Internet technology, plans to announce Tuesday
that it is developing almost a dozen new products to help corporate
customers integrate their phone and data communications networks.
</P>
<P>
   Nortel, formerly called Northern Telecom, is North America's
second-largest maker of traditional telecommunications equipment,
behind Lucent Technologies Inc. Nortel and Lucent are locked in
battle not only with each other but also with leaders in data
networking, including Cisco Systems Inc., to develop technology for
unified voice and data networks.
</P>
<P>
   Such unified networks could allow companies to reduce the amount
they spend maintaining separate voice and data systems, and could
even open the door to new sorts of services, including phones that
communicate with address book software.
</P>
<P>
   Developing so-called Internet telephony technology requires big
engineering commitments, and Nortel has recently appeared to lag in
that effort behind Lucent, Cisco and small Internet telephony
start-ups like Vocaltec Communications Ltd. and the Clarent Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the products that Nortel intends to introduce Tuesday
will not be commercially available for another year or so, but the
announcement seems sure to add momentum to Nortel's efforts to
become a leader in Internet telephony.
</P>
<P>
   While data networking companies like Cisco have appeared more
aggressive in encouraging customers to anticipate scrapping their
traditional phone networks in favor of more advanced Internet-based
systems, older companies like Lucent and Nortel have encouraged a
more evolutionary approach. That approach is geared to appeal to
companies that could be concerned about the reliability and
capabilities of Internet phone systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is that most alternatives offered to customers for
telephony over I.P. have been very primitive in the features they
offer,'' said James Long, president of the Nortel group that sells
products to business customers, referring to Internet protocol, the
language of cyberspace. ``What we are announcing are a spectrum of
products that allow customers to implement a converged network
along a whole spectrum, from continuing to run separate networks to
using an advanced Internet protocol network.''
</P>
<P>
   That spectrum of products ranges from Internet add-ons for
existing office phone systems made by Nortel, which will be
available immediately, to phone systems designed around Internet
technology from the ground up, which are not scheduled to become
available until the second quarter of next year.
</P>
<P>
   If Nortel meets that goal, it will find itself in roughly the
same ball park as its major competitors. Cisco wants to deploy
Internet-based office phone systems broadly early next year. Lucent
plans to sell Internet-based phone systems for small customers this
fall and to expand the products for large companies early next
year.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Long said that among the institutional customers that had agreed
to try Nortel's Internet phone technology were the University of
Texas at Austin; Countrywide Credit Industries, the mortgage
company; Kinko's Inc., the copy shop chain; Safeway Inc., the
supermarket company, and the Symantec Corp., the software maker.
</P>
<P>
   But developing systems for business customers is only part of
the Internet telephony equation. The other big part is developing
Internet phone technology for communications carriers like AT&AMP;T
Corp. Nortel's competitors seem slightly ahead in that part of the
industry, but the Internet telephony market for carriers is
immature and the eventual technology winners remain undetermined.

POOR ARE BEING SHUT OUT OF MEDICARE, FEDERAL OFFICIALS FEAR
</HEADLINE>
  (ms)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Concerned over the steep declines of the Medicaid
rolls in New York, federal officials are looking into whether local
governments across the state are improperly preventing the poor
from signing up for health benefits under the program.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government has already been examining stringent new
welfare policies in New York City that advocates for the poor and a
federal judge say have prevented many poor people from getting
prompt access to Medicaid coverage.
</P>
<P>
   But now, federal officials are looking into whether similar
problems exist outside the city and what, if anything, Albany is
doing to insure that localities are not erecting improper hurdles
to applying for coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The inquiry was outlined in a letter that Sue Kelly, a regional
administrator for the Federal Health Care Financing Administration,
sent to state health officials last month expressing her concerns
about New York.
</P>
<P>
   In the letter, Ms. Kelly said that it ``appears that barriers
exist in the application process'' for Medicaid both inside and
outside New York City. The letter specifically cites long delays in
approving the Medicaid applications of over 1,000 people in Nassau
County. Ms. Kelly noted that the agency would, as a result, conduct
a ``program review'' of the state's Medicaid program.
</P>
<P>
   New York State officials said that they welcomed the inquiry,
and that they would provide documents outlining the thoroughness of
their oversight. ``We look forward to that meeting so that we can
show HCFA the significant monitoring effort that the department has
undertaken in the Medicaid program,'' said John Signor, a spokesman
for the state's Department of Health.
</P>
<P>
   The concerns of federal officials are underscored by recent
statistics showing that many localities in New York State _ from
Nassau and Suffolk Counties to the Syracuse area and the Buffalo
area _ have reduced their Medicaid rolls far more than even New
York City has.
</P>
<P>
   Elisabeth Ryden Benjamin, a lawyer for the Legal Aid Society who
represents Medicaid recipients, called the federal inquiry a
significant development. ``This is an extremely serious step,'' she
said. ``The state needs to walk very carefully because what is
happening in the localities is a field full of land mines.''
</P>
<P>
   The fate of Medicaid recipients has drawn increasing attention
in New York and across the nation since 1996, when the federal
government passed a law overhauling its welfare program. That law
gave states sweeping new powers to impose a host of restrictions on
their poverty programs, such as strict time limits on cash
assistance to the poor. But that law also specified that poor
people would be able to keep their Medicaid coverage even if they
lost their eligibility for welfare benefits.
</P>
<P>
   In most states, eligibility for welfare benefits and for
Medicaid have been traditionally linked, and it has taken time for
states to implement procedures formally severing the two programs.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has been of particular interest in New York, where the
Medicaid rolls have decreased by 276,973, or 9 percent, since
President Clinton signed the law overhauling welfare in August
1996. The enrollment decline among New York's Medicaid population,
now at about 2.7 million, has drawn harsh rebukes from advocates
for the poor and other critics who say that many local governments
have erected huge hurdles to getting Medicaid insurance.
</P>
<P>
   In January, for example, a federal district judge ruled that New
York City had improperly denied applications for Medicaid from poor
people because they had not complied with the city's requirement
that they work in exchange for their welfare benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The steep enrollment decline is not limited to New York City,
where the Medicaid rolls have dropped by 8.3 percent since the
federal welfare law was passed in 1996. In that same period, the
caseloads have dropped by 15.5 percent in Suffolk County, 10.8
percent in Nassau County, 11.5 percent in the Syracuse area and
13.9 percent in the Binghampton area, according to state
statistics.
</P>
<P>
   New York state officials have themselves expressed concern that
federal rules intended to preserve Medicaid for people deemed
ineligible for welfare have not always been followed. In fact, last
January, state health investigators visited eight welfare offices
in New York City and found that four had failed to provide Medicaid
applications promptly.

MERGER DEAL BRINGS DISMAY TO HONEYWELL'S HOMETOWN
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Minn)  (ms)

</P>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ Honeywell Inc.'s merger with Allied Signal would
result in the loss of a corporate headquarters here, the loss of up
to 1,000 local jobs, and the migration of one of the region's
leading philanthropic institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Known in millions of American homes for its thermostats, the
company is rooted in the Twin Cities and is renowned here for
making generous charitable donations, amounting to about $13.4
million last year. Honeywell said the merged company would maintain
its financial commitment to the area, particularly to the
low-income neighborhood in which its headquarters is situated. But
local officials and civic leaders expressed dismay at news of the
merger.
</P>
<P>
   In the Phillips neighborhood, where the company is based, and
which is perhaps the poorest section of Minneapolis, there was a
strong reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've always given us grants on a large basis as long as we
kept performing the tasks we set out to do,'' said Anna
Bowlds-Perkins, chairwoman of the board of the Phillips Community
Development Corp., a job-training center. She added, ``With them
leaving, yeah, I think it's going to make a big difference. Their
presence is important.''
</P>
<P>
   Largely to help bolster the Phillips area, the company
established the Honeywell Foundation in 1957, and has funneled most
of its charitable donations through the foundation, which will move
to New Jersey, said Pearse O'Laughlin, the company's corporate
public relations manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commitments we've made in the Twin Cities will be
maintained,'' O'Laughlin said. The company, one of the 10 largest
in Minnesota, will retain the headquarters building, he said, and
continue to be the center of the home and building control
division, which includes the thermostat operation.
</P>
<P>
   Of more than 7,000 Honeywell employees in Minnesota, where the
general economy is booming, more than 6,000 will remain, he said.
The others will transfer to New Jersey or other locations, or be
laid off.
</P>
<P>
   Among Honeywell's philanthropic efforts is a high school, called
New Vistas, which has operated within the headquarters since 1990.
It will continue there, he said. New Vistas provides education to
pregnant and teen-age mothers. Already, 142 women have graduated
from the school.
</P>
<P>
   Honeywell has also donated $4.8 million, and thousands of
employees donated their labor and helped build 51 new
owner-occupied, three- and four-bedroom houses here. So far, 20 of
the 51 houses are finished. They cost $60,000 to $90,000 each.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been making dramatic progress,'' said Peter McLaughlin,
a Hennepin County Board member representing the south Minneapolis
area, who worked closely with Honeywell on the project. But he
added: ``Now we're being victimized by larger corporate powers over
which we have no control. To lose that capacity is a huge loss for
the community.''
</P>
<P>
   Amy Phenix, a spokeswoman for Mayor Sharon Sayles Belton of
Minneapolis, said the loss of Honeywell was very disappointing.
``Honeywell has been a community partner in the city of
Minneapolis,'' she said. ``I think simply its presence in the city
for 114 years as a major corporate powerhouse will be of a great
loss, but we're not feeling completely gloom and doom.''
</P>
<P>
   And McLaughlin said: ``I think that's true that the
philanthropic contributions will continue. But after some time, the
impetus, the energy will dissipate because Honeywell will no longer
be in the neighborhood.''

ERNIE WILKINS, JAZZ SAXOPHONIST AND COMPOSER, IS DEAD AT 79
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By BEN RATLIFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ernie Wilkins, a jazz saxophonist and one of the important
arrangers and composers for the Count Basie band of the 1950's,
died on Saturday at a nursing home in Copenhagan. He was 79 and
lived in Copenhagen.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications from a stroke, said his wife, Jenny.
</P>
<P>
   Born in St. Louis, Wilkins studied music at Wilberforce
University in Ohio. During a stint in the military, he played in a
band led by Willie Smith and was soon playing in Earl Hines' last
big band, for which he was also writing.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkins composed a great deal of music, but he could also tailor
the pieces of others to the talents of whatever band he was working
with. This was especially obvious in the New Testament Basie band
(representing the second great stretch of its leader's creativity),
which Wilkins was invited to join in 1951, on the recommendation of
the trumpeter Clark Terry.
</P>
<P>
   As a member of the band until the late 50s, Wilkins reworked
versions of ``One O'Clock Jump,'' ``Every Day I Have the Blues''
and ``Corner Pocket,'' making them some of the most famous tunes in
the group's repertory. His arrangements were precise and exuberant,
made of interlocking riffs and strong ensemble passages. Wilkins
``had a lot to do with how the band began to sound,'' Basie wrote
in his memoir, ``Good Morning Blues.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1956 Wilkins performed in and wrote arrangements for a Dizzy
Gillespie band that toured the Middle East and South America. In
the 1960s he wrote for bands led by Harry James, Terry and his
brother, the trombonist Jimmy Wilkins. In the early 1970s he
entered the record business, heading the artists and repertory
division of the Mainstream label. He also wrote a choral suite in
1975 called ``Four Black Immortals,'' which was performed at Town
Hall and Avery Fisher Hall in New York.
</P>
<P>
   He moved to Cophenhagen in 1980 and promptly started the
13-piece Almost Big Band, which drew on the talent of other
American expatriates in Denmark, including the pianist Kenny Drew,
the saxophonist Sahib Shihab and the drummer Ed Thigpen. Wilkins
conducted and played saxophone for the Almost Big Band and wrote
entirely new music for it. The band recorded four albums on the
Steeplechase label, and stayed together until Wilkins suffered a
stroke in 1991 that forced him to retire. His last record, with the
Danish Radio Big Band, was ``Suite for Jazz Band,'' on the Hep
label.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his wife and his brother, of Las Vegas, Nev., Wilkins is
survived by his stepchildren, Charlotte and Thomas, both of
Copenhagen. &QL;

HAROLD S. FAWCETT, 82, NAVY PHOTOGRAPHER
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Harold S. Fawcett, a Navy photographer who captured memorable
scenes of the Japanese attack at Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941, died
on Saturday at a hospital in Grafton, W. Va. He was 82 and lived in
Bridgeport, W. Va.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, said his wife, Norma Webb Fawcett.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Fawcett's photographs of mighty American warships
exploding, burning and rolling belly up were considered too
disturbing to be made public soon after the outbreak of World War
II. These images began to be published on the first anniversary of
the attack in Life magazine and in many American newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Officials in Washington at first tried to minimize the damage
at Pearl Harbor,'' said Paul Stillwell, director of the history
division of the United States Naval Institute and author of ``Air
Raid: Pearl Harbor!'' (Naval Institute Press, 1981). ``A year later
they thought the American people could accept setbacks.''
</P>
<P>
   After joining the Navy and serving on the USS Utah and the USS
Argonne, Fawcett attended the Navy School of Photography in
Pensacola, Fla., in 1939.
</P>
<P>
   The next year his aviation squadron was moved to Pearl Harbor.
Fawcett was at the Navy yard waiting in line for breakfast when the
Japanese planes attacked. ``When I realized what was happening,''
he said, ``I grabbed my camera and started shooting pictures.''
</P>
<P>
   One of his most widely reproduced photographs showed the
wreckage of the destroyers Downes and Cassin in dry dock in front
of the battleship Pennsylvania, flagship of the Pacific Fleet,
which was burning from a bomb hit.
</P>
<P>
   Fawcett suffered a minor injury to his knee in the attack, which
killed more than 2,000 American sailors.
</P>
<P>
   He later became a decorated pilot. Based on Bikini in the South
Pacific after the war, he photographed the detonation of two
hydrogen bombs.
</P>
<P>
   After 19 years in the Navy he retired as a chief petty officer.
He then joined Sears, Roebuck and Co.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, Fawcett is survived by two daughters,
Helen Fawcett of Santee, Calif., and Anne Hoover of Grants Pass,
Ore.; a stepson, Gregory Goodwin of Bridgeport; a brother, James, a
sister, Anna Boyles, and a stepsister, Rosalie McGee, all of
Grafton, and six grandchildren.

 &HT;    Dollars may come from dialers
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If federal regulators get their way, you won't need a
cellular phone to get billed for cellular calls. A move afoot could
make consumers pay for calls they place to cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   Now, cellular subscribers pay for calls they place and receive.
But the Federal Communications Commission is considering changing
the rules this week. It hopes the billing change will spur growth
in cellular use as it has in European and South American countries.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC will seek public comment on the rule change, commonly
referred to as calling-party-pays, before making a decision. The
FCC proposal would give wireless phone owners the option of whether
or not to have calling-party-pays.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth opposed the change, said Linda Lancaster, directory of
regulatory affairs for the Atlanta-based Bell, saying there's no
consumer demand and the change would be expensive. The increased
costs would be passed on to cellular subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, from a good business standpoint, we'd need to
recover those costs and there's no one else (to pass them on to),''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Atlantans' cellular use ranks third in market penetration after
Detroit and Greensboro, N.C., according to a recent report by
Scarborough Research.
</P>
<P>
   Lancaster disagreed such a billing change would spur a growth in
cellular.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, she said, the U.S. market and the European and
South American markets differ. In South America, where BellSouth
offers the billing option, customers can see at a glance _ based on
the number's prefix _ that they are calling a cell phone and may be
billed. Separate prefixes aren't feasible in the United States, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the United States must have a calling-party-pays
policy before consumers will view wireless service, a $40 billion
market, as a true alternative to traditional wired phone service in
the $190 billion U.S. phone market. Mexico adopted
calling-party-pays rules in April, and wireless use increased 10
percent the first month, said Michael Altschul, general counsel of
the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association.

HOW TO SUCCEED AS A TV ANCHOR WITHOUT REALLY TRYING
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By RANDY KENNEDY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ron Insana, the fast-talking CNBC anchor, is best known for his
unflappability. It's why he gets to interview the big guns of the
money world: Soros, Galbraith, Rubin; senators, CEOs, reclusive
hedge fund titans. His publicity agent actually called him Cool
when describing him.
</P>
<P>
   But you don't know the half of it. Late last week, he walked
into CNBC's studios in Fort Lee, N.J., smiled sweetly, and said,
``I just wrecked my car.'' (Actually, he had taken a sharp corner
in the parking garage and added a racing stripe to his E-class
Mercedes. The door will have to be replaced.)
</P>
<P>
   Then, looking calm and collected in full on-air makeup, he
followed his crash story by asking, ``So, we going to lunch?''
</P>
<P>
   Insana's center of gravity has always served him well. During
the last 14 years, he has built a reputation as one of the best
television journalists in the exploding field of business news. He
even seems to be taking with aplomb the news that has sent tremors
through his field during the last two weeks, that the Nasdaq Stock
Market may start evening trading as soon as September and the New
York Stock Exchange may consider extending the 4 p.m. close next
year. For most traders and those who cover them, it was like
hearing that the very laws of nature were being rewritten.
</P>
<P>
   But Insana says that with the ever upward arc of the market and
technology, the new hours were probably always just a matter of
time. And people should consider themselves lucky to have had it so
easy. ``We business journalists have had the closest thing to a
Civil Service job over the last 15 years,'' he says. ``You're off
at 4 o'clock, or at least I am. No weekends to speak of. Very
nice.'' Turning back to his iceberg lettuce salad, he says
offhandedly, ``What has been an incredibly normal life for being a
journalist may change dramatically, soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking back at the incredibly normal life of Insana, 38, it's
not easy for anyone, including Ron Insana, to figure out exactly
how he became a big-time journalist.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in Buffalo and later just north of Los Angeles, where
his parents moved when he was 13, he dreamed of being a rock
drummer. He soldiered away in a high school band that managed to
stay together into college, playing mostly ``bad 70's pop'' and
wedding gigs. Then at California State University at Northridge, he
majored in film and resisted his family's entreaties to take
business classes. If writing and directing failed, they asked,
wouldn't he like to be a producer?
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he wanted be the next Woody Allen or Mel Brooks. Or
Roger Corman. Or something. His first student short films included
``The Vampire Strikes Back.'' Plot? ``Dracula coming out of
retirement for one last gig. Transylvania was running a little low
on blood.'' Next: ``Edifice Rex,'' about ``a landlord with an
apartment complex.'' He feels the need to elaborate. ``It was about
a Jewish guy living in ancient Greece, married to his mother.''
</P>
<P>
   But as college ended, no one had offered him a corner office at
a studio. He was living with his parents, selling vitamins at a
mall. He was going to pitch meetings where entertainment executives
said no before he began his pitch. When a friend offered him an
entry level job at the Financial News Network, the fledgling cable
network that eventually merged with CNBC, he took it.
</P>
<P>
   Four months later, the network downsized, and he found himself
back at the mall. (``I made more with vitamins than I did at FNN,
actually.'') But then somehow, as if business journalism just would
not give up on him, he was hired back as a producer. And in May
1985, the fateful day arrived: both anchors (the network had only
two) called in sick on the same day, and Insana stepped up to the
anchor desk.
</P>
<P>
   He began to educate himself about business, because ``I couldn't
have an intelligent conversation with anybody in the room, and it
got really frustrating.'' But at first it was slow going. He would
interview executives, who would tell him ``they were going to use
their tax-loss carry-forwards to offset this and that and the other
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd repeat it verbatim in a story, and then I'd ask somebody
later, `What the hell was I talking about?'''
</P>
<P>
   But he kept at it, and finally, ``It just started to get so
interesting to me that I couldn't help but learn it.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, James Cramer, fund manager and founder of TheStreet.com,
calls him the most serious business journalist on television. He's
regularly on ``Today'' and ``NBC Nightly News'' with Tom Brokaw to
explain the market's movements to the masses. He has the honor of
being called a ``geek'' by Don Imus, who enlists him for financial
chat on his radio show. His 2 to 4 p.m. show on CNBC, ``Street
Signs,'' was the highest rated show ever on the network when the
market dived in October 1997. (He also managed to marry; he and his
wife, Melinda, have a 16-month-old daughter, Emily.)
</P>
<P>
   At this point, Insana looks at his watch. It's 1:30 p.m. and his
program begins in 15 minutes. His check has arrived but not his
car. Now it's 1:45. Outside on the sidewalk, he chats amiably. He
is not worried. A colleague dashes back into the restaurant and
emerges with a smiling diner named Rudy, who is a member of
Insana's country club. Everyone jams into Rudy's car, and Insana
makes it back to the studio with five minutes to spare.
</P>
<P>
   He ducks into the makeup room. ``Plenty of time,'' he says,
smiling.

NISOURCE DISCLOSES $5.7 BILLION HOSTILE BID FOR COLUMBIA 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By AGIS SALPUKAS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NiSource Inc. disclosed a hostile $5.7 billion cash offer for
the Columbia Energy Group, Monday and Columbia's chairman responded
that while his company is not for sale and is not interested in any
merger transaction he would present the bid to the board.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver G. Richard 3d, the chairman, president and chief
executive of Columbia, was responding to a letter sent by Gary L.
Neale, the chairman, president and chief executive officer of
NiSource, a major Midwest utility. Neale offered to buy Columbia
for $68 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Neale Monday made public a letter he had sent to Richard on
April 1 in which he made the offer. Columbia rejected the offer and
refused to engage in any discussions. The contents of Neale's
letter were reported in The Wall Street Journal on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Neale said in an interview yesterday that he was encouraged that
the proposal would be presented to the Columbia board. He added,
however, that he would court large institutional holders to support
its unsolicited bid to acquire Columbia, a major gas company in the
East.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was encouraged by a meeting Monday with David Kiefer,
the portfolio manager for the Prudential Utility Fund, which is the
second largest holder of Columbia stock.
</P>
<P>
   Kiefer said that a combination of the companies would open up
opportunities under deregulation and would create ``a lot of room
for many smart people'' at both companies.
</P>
<P>
   Several analysts said that since Columbia's stock is 74 percent
owned by institutional investors the hostile offer had a better
chance than normally in the utility industry, where hostile
takeovers are very rare.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're offering a nice premium,'' said Robert Rubin, a
utility analyst for Bear Stearns. The NiSource bid is 30.7 percent
higher than the average closing prices for Columbia common stock
for 20 trading days ended last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Investors seemed to believe that the offer might go through as
Columbia stock soared Monday, closing up $7.4375 to $63.1875 on the
New York Stock Exchange. Shares of NiSource were down 62.50 cents,
to $27.5625, also on the Big Board.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said that large institutional holders had little loyalty
to a company in comparison with smaller investors and are more apt
to ``just want to max out their value.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, he said, Richard had done a good job of
helping grow Columbia, which emerged out of a reorganization under
Chapter 11 in November 1995, and seemed determined to rebuild the
company on his own.
</P>
<P>
   An indication of this was that Richard began a hostile takeover
attempt of his own on April 18, offering to buy the Consolidated
Natural Gas Company for $6.3 billion. It was an attempt to break up
an agreement reached by Consolidated to be acquired by Dominion
Resources Inc. a large utility based in Richmond.
</P>
<P>
   But Consolidated, which is based in Pittsburgh, accepted
Dominion's offer, valued at $6.3 billion on May 11.
</P>
<P>
   The unusually large holdings by institutional investors go back
to Columbia's filing for bankruptcy protection. It frightened away
most smaller stockholders, but large holders bet that Columbia
could emerge from bankruptcy and do well.
</P>
<P>
   Since its reorganization plan was accepted in November 1995,
Columbia's annual earnings have have been growing, and it has been
increasing its dividend.
</P>
<P>
   Richard, in a glitzy annual report, stressed that the utility
was training many of its people to operate in states that have
deregulated natural gas and are moving to do the same in
electricity. In his letter rebuffing Neale, he said that Columbia
``is not for sale and is not interested in any merger transaction
in which another company acquires control of Columbia.''
</P>
<P>
   Columbia is based in Herndon, Va. and had revenues of $6.6
billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   Neale said that the companies would be a good fit. Columbia
serves 2.1 million natural gas customers in 34 states and is an
integrated company producing, shipping, storing and selling natural
gas.
</P>
<P>
   NiSource, which is based Merrillville, Ind., is smaller than
Columbia. It had $2.9 billion in revenues last year distributing
electricty to 421,000 customers, natural gas to 1 million customers
and water to 254,000 in the Midwest and Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Neale said that adding Columbia's capacity to produce and store
gas would help NiSource hedge its gas supplies. The ability to
hedge gas has grown more important as the industry has been
deregulated.

LEADING CANDIDATE FOR LAS VEGAS MAYOR NO STRANGER TO KANSAS CITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK MORRIS  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. - If the next likely mayor of Las Vegas ever
decides to visit Kansas City, he won't have to ask for restaurant
or hotel recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1980s, flamboyant defense attorney Oscar Goodman has
made regular stops in Kansas City to defend some of the city's most
notorious organized-crime figures, including Anthony ``Tony Ripe''
Civella.
</P>
<P>
   Goodman has parlayed his flamboyant representation of mob
luminaries elsewhere _ such as Meyer Lansky and Anthony ``Tony the
Ant'' Spilotro _ to make himself one of the most recognized
criminal-defense lawyers in the country. Spilotro once reputedly
placed a rival's head in a vise and squeezed his eyeballs out.
</P>
<P>
   From 1971 to 1986, Spilotro ruled Las Vegas. Spilotro's role was
captured by actor Joe Pesci in the movie ``Casino,'' and Goodman
appeared as himself in the film. The mob's influence in Las Vegas
waned when Spilotro was buried alive in an Indiana cornfield at the
behest of Chicago mob bosses.
</P>
<P>
   Goodman, 59, is the odds-on favorite to win election today as
the mayor of America's glitziest ZIP code. Goodman is running on a
populist platform of increasing fees on developers to refurbish
older neighborhoods, and solving the city's traffic and
air-pollution problems.
</P>
<P>
   In May's primary election, he came within 277 votes of winning
the office outright. His only opposition today is a sitting City
Council member whom one Las Vegas paper recently described as
``bland.''
</P>
<P>
   Bland and ineffective Goodman is not, say lawyers who have
worked with and against him in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't quarrel with how he got his reputation,'' said F.A.
White, a Northland criminal-defense lawyer who once worked with
Goodman on a local case.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Goodman won a five-year probationary sentence for a
Leawood man convicted of stealing $20 million from a Nebraska
insurance company so he could care for his severely handicapped
10-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   The year before, Goodman pronounced himself pleased with the
4-year term Civella received in a pharmaceuticals-fraud case. He
called it a ``breath of fresh air'' that a member of Kansas City's
most storied organized-crime families hadn't received a harsher
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   But Goodman's identification with organized crime has been his
opponents' harshest weapon in Las Vegas. They're concerned that he
might lend a new mob aura to a city that has come a long way from
the days when Bugsy Siegel held court there.
</P>
<P>
   Some attorneys who have squared off against him here have a
similar concern.
</P>
<P>
   David B.B. Helfrey, now a St. Louis defense lawyer, led the
Justice Department's Kansas City Organized Crime Strike Force in
the 1980s. He said Goodman's traditional attitude toward government
might not fit well with holding elective office.
</P>
<P>
   ``His historical perspective has been that government is evil
and that his clients were being maligned and unfairly treated,''
Helfrey said. ``As opposed to a dispassionate approach, his was a
personal approach, closely identifying with his clients. Whether he
can separate himself from his clients in his new position, I don't
know. I'm not sure he can.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodman, however, discounted those concerns in a recent
interview with /{The Associated Press/}.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just their attorney and their mouthpiece and
spokesman,'' Goodman said. ``When the media took a whack at my
clients, I would speak on their behalf.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people just have the image of the mob lawyer things.
But I, honest to God, believe I'm going to be the best mayor Las
Vegas ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City lawyer Byron Neal Fox said Las Vegas has nothing to
fear from Goodman.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you really go to the fiber of what he does, it's truly to
defend everyone's civil liberties,'' said Fox, who calls Goodman
his best friend. ``He can't succeed in the courtroom if the law
doesn't allow him to. Anybody who believes in justice and fairness
has no better friend. He's the most honorable guy who exists in
this world.''
</P>
<P>
   Helfrey said he was particularly concerned about the influence
that Goodman could wield over the Las Vegas gambling industry.
</P>
<P>
   Goodman's gaming experience in Missouri hasn't been without
controversy.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1994, the Missouri Gaming Commission banned a Las
Vegas gaming company from the state for two years, ruling that it
had failed to disclose a $6 million deal with a group of lobbyists
and lawyers, including Fox and Goodman. No money ever changed
hands.
</P>
<P>
   Fox said Goodman had been a magnet for such scrutiny, but said
he has always withstood it with ease.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FBI has looked him over a thousand times and never has
there been a problem,'' Fox noted.
</P>
<P>
   White and Helfrey said Goodman's charismatic personal style
sometimes masks a lack of preparation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I'd want him as my own lawyer, but I wouldn't
pass the opportunity to watch him,'' White said.
</P>
<P>
   Fox denied that Goodman sometimes spreads himself too thin. His
critics don't understand the uncommon gifts and energy Goodman
brings to life, Fox said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't recognize his unlimited capacity to give,
professionally, family-wise and to his friends,'' Fox said.

YELLOW FREIGHT ACQUIRES PHILADELPHIA TRUCKING FIRM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RANDOLPH HEASTER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OVERLAND PARK, Kan. _ Yellow Corp. has agreed to buy a
Philadelphia area trucking company in a deal valued at $200
million.
</P>
<P>
   Yellow, the Overland Park-based trucking company, has offered to
buy Jevic Transportation Inc. for $14 a share. Jevic's board of
directors has recommended that its shareholders accept the offer,
which includes the assumption of Jevic's debt.
</P>
<P>
   Yellow is financing the deal through existing debt facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Jevic, based in Delanco, N.J., employs about 2,300 people,
including 1,200 drivers. Its non-union work force is not expected
to be affected by a Yellow acquisition, and Jevic would operate as
a stand-alone company, both parties said.
</P>
<P>
   Jevic would maintain its current management team, including
Harry Muhlschlegel, its founder and president.
</P>
<P>
   If acquired, Jevic will be Yellow's fourth regional carrier.
Jevic operates in the upper Midwest and the Northeast, regions
where Yellow previously did not have a strong presence.
</P>
<P>
   Jevic posted $226.1 million in revenue last year, which would
boost Yellow's revenue from regional carriers to nearly 25 percent.
Yellow reported revenue of $2.9 billion in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Jevic operates as a cross of a truckload carrier and a
less-than-truckload carrier. The company has a network that lessens
the need for terminals where large freight loads are rerouted, as
is the case with less-than-truckload companies.
</P>
<P>
   Jevic has origin terminals in eight metropolitan areas where
freight is loaded into a trailer based on the driver's sequence of
stops.
</P>
<P>
   Yellow said it would form a separate management team to oversee
its regional carriers. A search for a president is under way, said
A. Maurice Myers, Yellow's chairman and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   Jevic can terminate the deal if it receives an unsolicited,
better offer from another suitor. If that occurs, Jevic would be
required to pay Yellow $4.75 million and cover legal expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Jevic's stock closed at 13 Monday on the Nasdaq Stock Market, up
3. Yellow closed at 17, up , also on the Nasdaq.

   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The nation's top securities cop is coming to
Kansas City on June 30 to help small businesses learn how to raise
money.

NEVER A DULL MOMENT IN THE IHL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE STEVENS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Houston Aeros deserved to win the Turner Cup. They had the
strongest team in the International Hockey League and on Saturday,
beat the Orlando Solar Bears, 5-3, in Game 7 of the Turner Cup
finals.
</P>
<P>
   Not to diminish the Aeros' title, but what was most striking
about this season is the Solar Bears' run. While the Aeros should
be considered one of the most dominant teams ever assembled in the
IHL, the Solar Bears accomplished a much rarer feat.
</P>
<P>
   The Solar Bears recovered from a 3-0 deficit to beat the Detroit
Vipers, 4-3, in the Eastern Conference finals. No NBA or Major
League Baseball team ever has come back from trailing 3-0 to win.
The Solar Bears became the fifth professional hockey team to do so.
The 1942 Toronto Maple Leafs and 1975 New York Islanders were the
only NHL teams to stage such a comeback. Two American Hockey League
teams rallied from 3-0 deficits.
</P>
<P>
   Several elements of the Solar Bears' comeback, or Vipers'
dismantling, were bizarre. As ``You Gotta Be There'' was the IHL's
marketing slogan for the playoffs, you gotta hear this.
</P>
<P>
   Through circuitous rule bending, Marc Lamothe started in goal
for the Vipers in Game 7 of the Eastern Conference finals. Several
weeks ago, this column touted Lamothe as the ``story of the IHL
playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Lamothe had two playoff shutouts as the Indianapolis Ice's
goalie. Even though he had been a backup for most of the season,
Lamothe came in relief in the playoffs and, more or less,
single-handedly led the Ice to a first-round upset over the
Cincinnati Cyclones.
</P>
<P>
   Lamothe nearly did the same against the Vipers, but the
Cinderella-esque Ice finally were eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   Here's where Lamothe's story changes. One of the Vipers'
goalies, Kevin Weekes, spent the end of the season with the
Vancouver Canucks. (Weekes, by the way, was part of the deal that
sent Pavel Bure to the Florida Panthers.)
</P>
<P>
   Weekes refused to report to the Vipers at the end of the
Canucks' season. The Vipers looked for loop holes to get a strong
emergency backup goalie.
</P>
<P>
   They found a loop hole. The Chicago Blackhawks are affiliated
with both the Ice and the Vipers.
</P>
<P>
   Lamothe, property of the Blackhawks, conveniently was moved from
the Ice to the Vipers by the NHL team.
</P>
<P>
   Although it didn't violate IHL rules, the move shouldn't have
happened. It made a mockery of the league. Come on, should the
Dallas Stars be allowed to have Patrik Roy as an emergency backup
in the Stanley Cup Finals? Allowing the Vipers to acquire Lamothe
was an embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   But hold on, there was another embarrassing move. Lamothe had to
start in Game 7 because the league suspended Vipers starter Andrei
Trefilov. Trefilov allegedly threw his stick into the crowd during
Game 6 and hit a woman.
</P>
<P>
   The alleged incident was not captured on videotape, so the
league went by a police report to make its ruling.
</P>
<P>
   So the Solar Bears won Game 7. They did so in ultra-dramatic
fashion by erasing a two-goal deficit with three minutes left. The
Solar Bears then won in double overtime.
</P>
<P>
   The Vipers' mojo turned the wrong way when they acquired
Lamothe. They got him when they led, 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   ICE DOGS UPDATE
</P>
<P>
   The Ice Dogs expect to have a similar affiliation with the Kings
this season, which most likely will keep about six players in Long
Beach. The Ice Dogs also are in preliminary talks with the Phoenix
Coyotes to develop a secondary affiliation.
</P>
<P>
   BOXY'S BUZZ
</P>
<P>
   Ice Dogs general manager/coach John Van Boxmeer still is being
considered for the Kings' coaching job. Speculation is buzzing that
Van Boxmeer will get the job. However, Kings GM Dave Taylor hasn't
confirmed that.
</P>
<P>
   The Ice Dogs' stance on Van Boxmeer's future is clear. While the
organization would love to have him back, they would be pleased to
see him go to the Kings. If Van Boxmeer goes to the Kings, it could
only help the Ice Dogs' relationship with the NHL team.
</P>
<P>
   A curious fact about Van Boxmeer's four seasons as the Ice Dogs'
coach is that his run with the organization is extremely long by
hockey coaching standards.
</P>
<P>
   With Ron Low announcing that he is stepping down as the Edmonton
Oilers' coach, that leaves only one NHL head coach Scotty Bowman,
who took over the Detroit Red Wings for the 1993-94 season who has
been with his team longer than Van Boxmeer has been with the Ice
Dogs.
</P>
<P>
   COUNT ON 14
</P>
<P>
   Barring an off-season surprise, the IHL will have 14 teams next
season, down from 16.
</P>
<P>
   The Las Vegas Thunder folded, and the Fort Wayne Komets most
likely will move to the United Hockey League. Although Fort Wayne
keeps edging toward moving, the team has not officially announced
it.

MAN WON'T FACE THIRD TRIAL IN SLAYING OF HIS WIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BENITA Y. WILLIAMS  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ After two murder trials and almost eight
years in jail, Clarence Dexter on Monday left the Clay County
Courthouse a free man.
</P>
<P>
   Special prosecutor Tim Finnical dropped the first-degree murder
charge against Dexter in the death of his wife, Carol, because key
evidence has been lost.
</P>
<P>
   The case began to crumble this spring when prosecutors could not
find a police 911 tape, samples of a T-shirt Dexter allegedly wore
the night of the killing, bullet fragments from the autopsy and a
newspaper from the crime scene with a bloody footprint on it.
</P>
<P>
   Finnical asked for the dismissal after a two-hour debate about
evidence with Dexter's lawyers. Finnical first requested a recess
to privately tell Carol Dexter's family of his plans.
</P>
<P>
   When the case was dismissed, Clarence Dexter quietly said
``thank you'' and hugged his lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Dexter's family was silent.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of our tears have dried up a long time ago,'' her brother,
Olan Thrasher, said afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not letting him out because he's innocent,'' he said.
``They're letting him out because they lost the evidence....What we
wanted was closure and justice, and we haven't gotten it.''
</P>
<P>
   Finnical said he would continue searching for the evidence and
would refile charges if it is found.
</P>
<P>
   ``That evidence could turn up,'' he said. ``If I go forward now
and I lose and three weeks later they find these items, I'm going
to look bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Thrasher said his family is devastated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll give them a couple or three weeks to find (the
evidence)...,'' Thrasher said. ``But someone has to be held
responsible....Someone has to take responsibility for letting
(Dexter) walk free.''
</P>
<P>
   Dexter, 57, who developed heart, colon and kidney problems in
jail, left court in a wheelchair and later celebrated at his
lawyer's office with a chocolate milkshake and pizza.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I want to do is get a pole and go fishing,'' Dexter said.
``I knew I was innocent all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Dexter said he planned to live with his mother in Butler, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   Dexter was accused of shooting his 50-year-old wife four times
at their Kansas City, North, home on Nov. 18, 1990. Prosecutors
alleged that Dexter then went to the supermarket. When he returned
and found her still alive, prosecutors alleged, he beat her with a
hammer.
</P>
<P>
   Dexter contended that an intruder killed his wife and that he
found her body after returning from the supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   His first trial ended in a mistrial. The Missouri Supreme Court
overturned a murder verdict in his second trial because lawyers
talked in court about how Dexter was silent when arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Finnical said Monday that he is looking through evidence bags
from other Clay County cases that went to trial in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The missing items ``could have been inadvertently placed in with
evidence from other cases,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dexter's defense team, public defenders Cyndy Short and Tom
Jacquinot, issued a three-page statement Monday saying that
evidence in the case _ including several items that are missing _
is flawed.
</P>
<P>
   They said that investigators ignored a broken pane of plastic
glass and an unidentified palm print at the scene that could prove
that a burglar killed Carol Dexter.

UA PLANS TO SPECIALIZE IN INDEPENDENT FILMS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA MONICA, Calif. _ United Artists, once one of Hollywood's
legendary names with a dozen Best Picture Academy Awards, has
announced it will specialize in independent films costing less than
$20 million.
</P>
<P>
   The move means Santa Monica-based UA, founded 80 years ago by
Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, D.W. Griffith and Mary
Pickford, will be competing for edgy, low-cost fare like ``Pulp
Fiction'' and ``Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels'' against
established indie players like Miramax, Gramercy and Sony Classics.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman said Monday that UA, a division of struggling
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, would release four to six movies per year. UA
will still be identified as a producer on this year's James Bond
movie, ``The World Is Not Enough,'' but that affiliation will
disappear from any subsequent Bond movies.
</P>
<P>
   The shift underscores the substantial change from the heritage
of UA, which thrived from the 1950s to the late 1970s under the
management of Arthur Krim. Its library includes the ``Rocky'' and
James Bond films, as well as ``Rebecca,'' ``High Noon,'' ``West
Side Story,'' ``One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,'' ``Apocalypse
Now,'' ``Raging Bull'' and ``Rain Man.''
</P>
<P>
   UA has been fairly quiet in recent years with the exception of
two James Bond movies _ ``Goldeneye'' and ``Tomorrow Never Dies'' _
and a few moderate successes in 1998 with Leonardo DiCaprio
swordfest ``The Man in the Iron Mask'' and Robert DeNiro's
``Ronin.''
</P>
<P>
   Speculation had emerged that rebranding UA was under
consideration as a way for new MGM chiefs Alex Yemendjian and Chris
McGurk to put their mark on the operation for longtime owner Kirk
Kerkorian.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United Artists legacy as a haven for independent
filmmakers is so indelible, having been established for more than
80 years, that we could not pass up the extraordinary opportunity
to capitalize on that proud name, strengthen its current branding
and, at the same time, create a new role for it as part of a
dynamic, evolving market for smaller films,'' said McGurk, who had
been president of Universal Pictures before joining MGM in late
April.
</P>
<P>
   The move by struggling MGM is the latest in a long series of
changes by Kerkorian, the billionaire investor who has owned the
studio off and on for the past 30 years. UA began distributing MGM
films in 1973; eight years later, Kerkorian bought UA from
TransAmerica and combined it with MGM after ``Heaven's Gate''
bombed.
</P>
<P>
   Kerkorian, who owns 90 percent of MGM, has been rumored to be
seeking partnerships with Barry Diller's USA Studios and other
cable companies in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line with MGM is that it's got a very strong
library, but to compete with other studios, it needs to either be
sold or form a key strategic venture,'' said Barry Hyman, an
analyst with Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum. ``Otherwise, they're just
shuffling assets, which is what Kerkorian has always been known
for.''
</P>
<P>
   Movie analyst Arthur Rockwell, a former MGM executive, said the
move is a way of saving money by focusing on low-cost projects.
``They obviously don't have enough money to operate two major
divisions,'' he added. ``And until they have the talent and
capital, they're just spinning their wheels. They're clearly at the
bottom of agents' lists for major projects so they have to
re-establish their credibility financially and creatively.''
</P>
<P>
   MGM stock gained 87.5 cents to $15.625 a share, but as the
company continues to bleed red ink, it is still 25 percent below
the $20 per share price in its 1997 initial public offering. It
lost $306.6 million in the first quarter of 1999, partly due to its
$225 million payment for ending a video distribution deal.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the next Bond movie, UA still has a remake of ``The
Thomas Crown Affair'' in the pipeline for an August release.
</P>
<P>
   MGM also announced that UA, whose most recent release was ``The
Rage: Carrie II,'' will lose president Lindsay Doran, who will set
up shop as an independent producer with a first-look deal with MGM.
No replacement was named Monday, but the spokesman said an
announcement will come soon.

FOUR MONTHS AFTER SHOOTOUT WITH POLICE, ESCAPED INMATE RECAPTURED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MALCOLM GARCIA  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ An inmate who escaped from jail a month after
a shootout that left five Missouri law officers wounded was
recaptured in Missouri on Monday night, Chariton County sheriff's
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   No other details on the capture were available.
</P>
<P>
   Donnie Lee Fisher escaped about 8:20 p.m. Sunday by picking a
lock on his shackles with a piece of wire and breaking through a
fence in the jail's exercise yard, Chariton County Sheriff Chris
Hughes said. Fisher struck a female guard who tried to stop him and
ran east from the prison, the sheriff said.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher was among 20 inmates in the exercise yard under the
supervision of two jailers, Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were holding him until he was ready for court,'' Hughes
said. ``I dealt with him personally. We had him about a month. He
wasn't a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisher was involved in a shootout with police in Huntsville,
Mo., in February. That shootout followed an escape by Fisher and
two other inmates from a Georgia prison.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two dozen state, county and city law enforcement agencies
in and around Keytesville in north-central Missouri searched for
Fisher Sunday night and Monday, Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher had been scheduled to appear in court Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher is originally from Belle, Mo., and has family and friends
in Boone County, Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   He had been serving an eight-year sentence for kidnapping at the
Georgia State Prison in Reidsville, but on Feb. 15 he and two other
men hid in the back of a food service van as it left the prison,
overpowered the driver and escaped.
</P>
<P>
   One of the fugitives, Danny E. Pierce, 48, was captured soon
after the escape.
</P>
<P>
   Officers tracked Fisher, 28, and Roy Kenneth Sanford, 30, to a
trailer in Huntsville early Feb. 25. Five officers from Huntsville
and nearby Moberly were wounded in the shootout before the
fugitives surrendered.
</P>
<P>
   The officers had thrown tear gas into the trailer to smoke the
men out. After waiting about 45 minutes, the officers walked toward
the trailer to arrest the two, believing they were unconscious. But
as the officers reached the door, police say, the fugitives began
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Two officers were shot in the face and two others were hit in
the legs. Another was grazed by a bullet. Police believe the
fugitives used rags as makeshift gas masks.
</P>
<P>
   After about 25 minutes of gunfire, Sanford and Fisher waved a
white rag out a window, threw out their shotgun and surrendered.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher has an extensive arrest record. He was convicted in 1991
of kidnapping and robbery in Pulaski County, Mo. In 1994, he began
serving an eight-year sentence in Georgia for kidnapping charges
there. Sanford was serving 60 years for armed robbery, aggravated
assault and kidnapping. Pierce had been serving a life sentence for
robbery.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher and Sanford also are charged in the February shootout.
Both men were charged with five counts of first-degree assault on a
law enforcement officer, six counts of armed criminal action and
one count of first-degree burglary.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher last month pleaded not guilty to the charges, telling the
judge, ``They shot me first.'' Sanford also pleaded not guilty.

JOCKS DON'T KNOW HOW TO FIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's even money what I find more silly when athletes resort to
fists to settle their differences the fight itself, or the
post-mortem media reflections.
</P>
<P>
   As for the actual confrontation, it inevitably proves, as the
Dodgers' Chan Ho Park showed graphically the other afternoon during
his crude frolic with the Angels' Tim Belcher, that most
well-conditioned jocks haven't the faintest idea of how to fight.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Park's scandalously inept kick to Belcher's ample
midriff had to be the most embarrassing moment for karate since a
bodyguard named Chuck Zito floored martial arts film star Jean
Claude Van Damme last year at a New York gentlemen's club called
Scores, or at least since Steve Seagal was choked out on a movie
set a while back by stunt man Gene LeBell.
</P>
<P>
   But even more inane than Park's temporary lost of sanity was
those who viewed Park's move as a heroic gesture that actually lit
an inspirational fire to his lifeless team, saying it wasn't
exactly a coincidence that the Dodgers staged a game-winning
five-run rally an inning after Park committed his indiscretion.
</P>
<P>
   Humbug!
</P>
<P>
   I quite doubt that Devon White drew his motivation to hit his
dramatic grand slam that inning from Park's ridiculous outburst.
</P>
<P>
   It long has been the view here that the most farcical fights
I've seen and I've seen several thousand over the years have not
been in the ring, but, instead, on the ice, hardwoods and sporting
fields.
</P>
<P>
   Athletes untrained in defending themselves should resist their
macho inclinations during periods of temper because all they wind
up doing is setting themselves up for cruel ridicule when the taped
highlights of their actions are continually replayed on the nightly
sports shows.
</P>
<P>
   How mortifying do you think it was for Alonzo Mourning and Larry
Johnson when their sorority-like pillow squabble last year was
shown over and over again on TV?
</P>
<P>
   What did their less than memorable quarrel prove, that neither
hadn't the foggiest notion how to throw a punch, or duck one?
</P>
<P>
   Athletic fights are meaningless, anyway, because the combatants
are well aware that they will be quickly separated by arbiters and
teammates.
</P>
<P>
   I mean, if a couple of antagonists are serious about resolving
hostilities, why don't they choose to settle matters in a venue
where there is no one around to intervene?
</P>
<P>
   This is a tack the late combative manager, Billy Martin, pursued
several times during his career, once as a player meeting a tough
catcher named Clint Courtney under the ball park stands in
Washington D.C. and giving him a frightful beating.
</P>
<P>
   A most famous incident during the 1963 NFL season occurred when
a couple of Philadelphia Eagle players, Ben Scotti, a 180-pound
defensive back, and John Mellekas, a 250-pound defensive tackle,
duked it out in a hotel room.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, Scotti emerged triumphant, as he unmercifully beat
up Mellekas, leaving him bloodied and battered and barely
conscious.
</P>
<P>
   Shamefully, your unflappable correspondent must admit he once
lost control of his senses, although he displayed fine sporting
instincts in sticking to the Marquis of Queensberry rules and never
cutting lose with the kind of comical flying leg kick that Chan Ho
Park must have learned from watching old Charlie Chaplin movies.
</P>
<P>
   As a senior at Fowler High School in the San Joaquin Valley a
few years back, I got into a fight in the school's main hallway
that was broken up immediately by a couple of teachers that ushered
me and my adversary into the vice-principal's office.
</P>
<P>
   Since it was one of those trivial misunderstandings and since no
serious punches were landed, the proper thing would have for both
of us to quickly make up and accept whatever minimal punishment
that was warranted.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, we glared at each other and refused to shake hands,
leading the vice-principal to shake his head disapprovingly and
decide on a plan that would be unthinkable in these litigious days.
</P>
<P>
   ``You guys wanna fight so bad I'm goin' to give you the
opportunity,'' he said. ``Let's go to the gym right now, and you
guys can put on the gloves and fight to your heart's content.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is exactly what we did.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing boxing gloves but bereft of headgear and mouthpiece, we
went after each other with a vengeance without a break for about 15
minutes in the closed gym, in front of the vice-principal, the
school nurse and the head football coach.
</P>
<P>
   It would be nice to report that I wound up the stirring winner,
but that would be a Clintonesque fib because the match ended the
moment I dropped to my knees from overwhelming exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, such a lengthy brawl taught me a painful and
humbling lesson fighting should be the sole refuge of people who do
it for a living.
</P>
<P>
   Those faux-gladiators you see flailing haplessly away like Chan
Ho Park only make fools out of themselves and serve no viable
purpose other than to unnecessarily interrupt the flow of a game
and cause a few cackles among the onlookers.

 &HT;    Spurs win prompts box-office bonanza
 &HT;    By Randy Riggs
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ When Shelby Brown arrived for work at Ticket
City on Monday at 6 a.m., two hours before the ticket brokerage
firm opened for business, the phones already were ringing.
</P>
<P>
   That should have been a hint.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's off the wall,'' Brown said several hours later as phones
rang incessantly in the background, the majority of callers
inquiring about tickets to see the San Antonio Spurs play in the
NBA Finals. ``I can't even pick up the phone fast enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently folks are willing to pay to see history _ pay big, in
many cases. The Spurs' first trip to the Finals in their 26-year
existence in San Antonio had ticket buyers and sellers scrambling
on Monday in advance of the first two games, which will be played
in the Alamodome. The first game of the Finals is scheduled to
start as early as June 13.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs announced at 4 p.m. Monday that the first two games
were officially sold out in the Dome, which will have a seating
capacity of slightly more than 38,000 for the Finals. Tickets for
any other possible home games in the 2-3-2 Finals arrangement won't
go on sale until it's known if there will be a sixth game in San
Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been pretty wild around here,'' said Pat Quinn, the
Spurs' director of ticket operations. ``Normally I'm on vacation
this time of year, but I certainly don't mind delaying my vacation
for this.''
</P>
<P>
   Fans started camping out in the Alamodome parking lot Saturday.
They were allowed to begin lining up Sunday evening as soon as the
Spurs clinched the Western Conference title at Portland, although
tickets didn't go on sale until 8 a.m. Monday. The scene was no
less chaotic at several Austin ticket brokerages, some of whom were
offering courtside seats for between $4,000 and $6,500 each,
although there had been no takers for those by late Monday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nuts. I didn't expect it to be this crazy,'' said Tracy
Morris of Showtime Tickets in Austin. ``Man, I'm tired of saying,
'$85 and up.' If I had a dollar for every time I've said '$85 and
up,' I'd be rich by now.''
</P>
<P>
   For $85, a buyer could get a ticket in the upper reaches of the
Alamodome behind the basket, a seat that normally sells for $5
during the regular season. But in the Finals, even the official
face value for that ticket has increased to $15. First-row floor
seats that normally have a face value of $325 during the season are
selling for $500 in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The interest is) kind of like when the Final Four was in San
Antonio, but with a more localized crowd,'' Showtime owner Kent
Taylor said. ``About 95 percent of the calls are from people
comparing prices. I didn't expect the amount of calls, but I felt
more people would be buying than have actually bought.''
</P>
<P>
   UT TicketMaster received about 450 tickets for each of the first
two Finals games in San Antonio. They went on sale at about 30
H-E-B outlets at 8 a. m. Monday and were gone in about 15 minutes,
which TicketMaster manager David Hess said is not unusual for a
high-demand event.

THE SALMON'S NEW CHANCE 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, June 8: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The decline of the once-great salmon populations off the Pacific
coasts of Canada and the United States ranks high on the list of
the 20th century's environmental disasters. But 1999 may well turn
out to be the year when the fish finally caught a break. In March,
acting under the Endangered Species Act, the federal government set
in motion a regional plan to restore salmon runs throughout the
Pacific Northwest. Then last week, following years of fruitless
negotiations, the United States and Canada announced a plan to set
new limits on salmon catches and establish a conservation fund to
further protect the fish.
</P>
<P>
   At the core of the complex agreement are new protections for
``intercepted'' salmon stocks _ fish that spawn in one country but
are caught as they migrate through another country's waters. Under
the old rules, fishermen in, say, Alaska or British Columbia were
allowed to catch a fixed number of fish every year, regardless of
the health of the fish population. Under the new agreement, harvest
levels would be adjusted up or down based on scientific
measurements of fish stocks along thousands of miles of coastline.
The agreement also calls for a $140 million fund that would be used
to buy up fishing licenses _ essentially paying some fishermen not
to fish _ and to begin restoration efforts in rivers whose spawning
areas have been damaged.
</P>
<P>
   The importance of this agreement is that it finally addresses
the demand side of the salmon equation. The supply of fish can be
increased if the rivers where they spawn are restored to good
health. But these efforts will mean little if the fish continue to
be over-harvested at sea. The agreement is also heartening in
another sense. As David Anderson, the Canadian fisheries minister,
once observed, ``if two friendly neighbors can't agree on this
issue, what does that forecast for diplomacy elsewhere?'' Anderson
deserves much credit for this deal, along with Gov. Tony Knowles of
Alaska _ who agreed to subject Alaska's profitable annual harvest
to the new rules _ and Trout Unlimited, a private organization that
suggested key provisions.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Gore played a role, too, which cannot hurt his
environmental credentials. But he has more to do. Money must still
be secured from a Republican Congress for the United States' share
of the $140 million restoration program, as well as for a separate
$100 million fund _ a special favorite of Gore's _ to help the
Pacific Northwest clean up rivers and streams. Beyond that, the
Administration will face a politically risky decision later this
year about whether to dismantle four hydropower dams on the Snake
River, which over the years have had a calamitous effect on salmon
stocks. That decision will tell a lot about how serious this
Administration is about the salmon.

NOW THAT BELFOUR'S CALM, HE'S REALLY UNDER PRESSURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
DALLAS _ Ed Belfour has never had less control of his future. And
yet he's never been more in control.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The latest story of the Stars goalie, in fact, drips irony. It
is somewhere between a Dickens novel and a Danielle Steel
miniseries.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he got into actually thinking about everything that's going
on, I think it would be a little overwhelming,'' said Buddy Voth,
Belfour's business manager and friend since childhood. ``Right now,
he's focused on winning, and that's all that matters to him.''
</P>
<P>
   As Belfour steps onto the ice tonight at Reunion Arena to face
the Buffalo Sabres in Game 1 of the Stanley Cup Finals, he will
stare down his past and wonder about his future. Belfour, 34, has
the chance to finally grasp the Cup that he has dreamed about since
a hockey-bred youth in the tiny farming community of Carman,
Manitoba. He has the chance to silence critics who for years have
said he can't win the big one. He has the chance to lay claim to a
home he has been seeking, possibly for his entire life.
</P>
<P>
   Or, he could end up blowing his big chance at redemption and
never play in a Stars uniform again. The possibility exists that Ed
Belfour could be the property of the expansion Atlanta Thrashers at
the end of the month, that he could be further from his goal than
ever in his career.
</P>
<P>
   That's how important this is. Ed Belfour's crossroads will come
in the next two weeks _ a fortnight that will forever burn as a
turning point in his life. And how will the enigmatic Belfour
respond?
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I'm just concentrating on playing hockey; it's
pretty simple,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, and maybe for the first time in his NHL life, Ed
Belfour has one goal in mind. Controlled and composed In the past,
nothing Ed Belfour did was simple. In the past, he was both admired
and feared, scrutinized and convicted. In the past, Ed Belfour was
a conundrum. But that was the past. Today, at a time when Belfour
should be under the most pressure in his career, he is controlled
and composed and witty and ... normal.
</P>
<P>
   And that might be the greatest irony of all. Ed Belfour, normal
guy _ it sends shock waves through the hockey world. Ed Belfour,
the guy who has fought with backup goalies. That's what you expect.
Ed Belfour, one of the most penalized goalies in league history.
That's what you expect. Ed Belfour, the perfectionist, loner,
wild-eyed, stick-swinging rebel without a clue. That's what you
expected.
</P>
<P>
   Not any more. And the difference is tangible, Stars coach Ken
Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ed Belfour was a defensive person when he came here. And for
us to get the best out of Ed Belfour, the determination was that we
needed the defense mechanisms dropped,'' Hitchcock said. ``And
they're dropped. He's happy where he lives. He's just a happier
person.''
</P>
<P>
   So how can Hitchcock tell? Well, for one thing, Hitchcock said
he has actually heard Belfour whistling at practice. And secondly,
he hasn't heard Belfour blame anyone else for a goal _ a trait that
used to make teammates cringe, a flaw that maybe even kept him from
the ultimate goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's willing to look in the mirror at the end of the game,''
Hitchcock said. ``He's not willing to talk in terms of `It went
over here and it hit a bird and flew into the net' or whatever.
He's just talking normal. When he talks normal, and when he talks
black and white, realistic stuff, then he's being truthful with
himself. And that's what he's being.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's comfortable here,'' Hitchcock added.
</P>
<P>
   Voth, his business manager and friend, said Belfour would like
to stay in North Texas. The Stars at the end of the month will have
to make a decision on keeping either Belfour or 29-year-old
wunderkind backup goalie Roman Turek. An expansion draft will be
held to stock the Atlanta Thrashers, and the Stars will be able to
protect only one goalie. Either Belfour or Turek will be traded or
made available for the expansion draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough situation, and they really haven't let him know
one way or the other,'' Voth said. ``He really wants to focus on
the game and not let that bother him. But I think if you asked him,
he'd love to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   Belfour has found a home, Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everywhere he's been he's looked for a place where he
could be comfortable. And I think he's found it here,'' Hitchcock
said. ``I really believe he sees this as home.''
</P>
<P>
   Belfour is a divorced father of two, and his children still live
in Chicago with their mother. And although moving away from his
children was difficult, Belfour has come to grips with the
situation. Facing his past Now, ironically, he will look back at
that rocky past _ the rough days in Chicago that helped lead to the
divorce from his wife and from his former team, the Blackhawks _ to
see if he can build a better future.
</P>
<P>
   Across the rink tonight will be Buffalo Sabres all-world goalie
Dominik Hasek. Once a backup to Belfour, who owned the NHL in 1992
as Chicago went to the Finals, Hasek has since gone on to pass
Belfour's accomplishments. Belfour has two Vezina trophies (1991,
'93), the award given to the NHL's top goalie annually; Hasek is
expected to win his fifth this season. Belfour has won three
Jennings trophies for having the lowest goals-against average.
Hasek is the only goalie in NHL history to twice be chosen league
MVP.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's done a great job; he's a great goalie,'' Belfour said.
``What can you say.''
</P>
<P>
   There are those who want to say Belfour hated Hasek and that
Hasek hated Belfour. There are those who want to say this battle of
goalies will forge forever which one is better, which one gets his
first Cup, which one reaches the goal.
</P>
<P>
   The old Belfour might have bitten on such a confrontational
issue. The new Belfour just laughs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't see anything wrong with the relationship,'' Belfour
said. ``Maybe he had a problem with it because I was the No. 1 guy,
and whenever that's the case and the other goalie wants to be the
No. 1 guy. Maybe he doesn't feel comfortable. I didn't ever have a
problem with Dominik.''
</P>
<P>
   Granted, that's not to say Belfour wasn't competitive. He has
been competitive since he kicked around the cradle. He has been
competitive every day that Voth has known him.
</P>
<P>
   ``You couldn't be around Eddie without getting into a battle
over something,'' Voth said.
</P>
<P>
   Alma Belfour, Ed's mother, said the family couldn't ``just go
fishing'' when Ed was young.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to have a fishing tournament,'' she said. ``Eddie had
to have the biggest fish or the most fish. When he played baseball,
he had to strike everybody out.''
</P>
<P>
   And that competitiveness is still there, players assure. But the
Norman Bates unpredictability seems to be gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see it in his eyes,'' Stars winger Pat Verbeek said. ``You
can see he's focused, you can see he wants to play the best that he
can play.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony Hrkac, Belfour's roommate on the road and his teammate when
they both played for 1987 NCAA champion North Dakota, said Belfour
has matured.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know that book, ``Don't Sweat The Small Stuff'',' '' Hrkac
said. ``I think he read that.''
</P>
<P>
   And even in the eye of this maelstrom, this life-changing
playoffs, Belfour has kept the small stuff at a distance. He has
been chatty with the media, calm in his crease, downright humble in
the face of hot-dog tactics by Colorado Avalanche goalie Patrick
Roy. In the end, Belfour's newfound inner peace probably helped
produce the victory over the much-ballyhooed Roy. In the end, it
was Belfour drawing all the praise and Roy being accused of a
meltdown. In the end, it seems, Ed Belfour can best control his
critics _ best control his future _ by staying in control.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, it wasn't that difficult a lesson for Belfour to
learn, once he bought into the concept.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's probably matured. I think we all do,'' Alma
Belfour said. ``Let me tell you, you're never too old to mature.''

 &HT;    One man is being sought for questioning in Weimar homicides
 &HT;    By Kelly Daniel
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEIMAR, Texas _ No one simply goes to bed here these days.
</P>
<P>
   There are flood lights to install, position and watch. Guns to
load, and clench. Locks to turn, some for the first time in a
lifetime. Police are hunting a killer, and the 2,000 residents here
are facing a new, unwanted neighbor: fear.
</P>
<P>
   Three people who lived in or near Weimar have been bludgeoned to
death in their beds in the past 37 days, the killer entering
darkened homes that sit within a stone's throw of railroad tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Two Houston women have been killed in similar fashion and,
although police investigators haven't determined if the cases are
linked, one man is being sought for questioning in all the
homicides.
</P>
<P>
   In Weimar, where vacant storefronts outnumber thriving
businesses and the mostly elderly populace has gone decades without
locking their doors, the town's ``dying and bored'' way of life has
slipped into haggard wariness.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like, death comes to a small town,'' said Jill Dwyer,
owner of Weimar Country Grocery. ``I don't want to be here. I don't
want to sleep here.''
</P>
<P>
   Such fright didn't exist until Josephine Konvicka, 73, was
discovered beaten to death Friday in her Fayette County home about
four miles west of Weimar. Her slaying came nearly five weeks after
the Rev. Norman ``Skip'' Sirnic, 46, and his wife, Karen, 47, were
found May 2, beaten to death with a sledgehammer in the parsonage
of the Weimar United Church of Christ, where he was the minister
and she the church secretary.
</P>
<P>
   People either grew up in Weimar or came to escape Houston or San
Antonio, both within 100 miles. Most folks are hard pressed to
recall Weimar's last homicide _ a bar brawl nearly 20 years ago _
and say crime here usually stops at simple break-ins.
</P>
<P>
   The Sirnic slayings had been shocking, the kind of news that
hits like a punch to the windpipe. The city was just beginning to
recover when Konvicka's death halted people in their tracks,
raising goosebumps on their skin, residents say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once that lady that lived out there got it, too, you started
thinking, `Yeah, he's really in this area,' '' said Michael Wick,
whose family owns the town's Western Auto.
</P>
<P>
   Police are looking for Rafael Resendez-Ramirez, 38, considered a
suspect in the Sirnic deaths. He was featured in an ``America's
Most Wanted'' television segment over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Weimar Police Chief Bill Livingston, who is heading the
investigation, did not return repeated phone calls and was not at
the police station Monday afternoon. Fayette County Sheriff Rick
Vandel said his department believes Resendez-Ramirez has left the
area.
</P>
<P>
   Resendez-Ramirez also is a suspect in the December 1998
bludgeoning death of Dr. Claudia Benton of Houston, and Houston
police are investigating a second bludgeoning death _ of Noemi
Dominguez, 26, found Saturday _ for similarities. Both women lived
near railroad tracks. Kentucky police also want to question
Resendez-Ramirez about the 1997 slaying of a University of Kentucky
student.
</P>
<P>
   There are few other topics of conversation in Weimar these days.
Friends and relatives trade rumors _ he was spotted in Flatonia,
where officers searched railroad tracks with bloodhounds Sunday; he
was seen under someone's front porch; he was noticed atop a
railroad boxcar _ while shopkeepers and customers trade security
tips.
</P>
<P>
   The M-G Inc. store, where browsers can find everything from
garden seeds to hunting equipment, sold several guns first thing
Monday morning, ran through its entire stock of Mace and did a
steady business in security lighting kits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got plenty of shells,'' said Erna Rose, 70, a lifelong
Weimar resident. She came to the store for a bulb for her outdoor
security light, having already taken out her shotgun at home and
loaded it. ``Everybody's coming home earlier at night, not staying
out after dark.''
</P>
<P>
   Every person has a story, either his own or a friend's, of
teen-agers too scared to sleep alone, of elderly relatives moving
in with family members, of lights being kept on all night.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of scared people (and) a lot of people with guns by
their beds,'' said Dwayne Wick, Michael's brother.
</P>
<P>
   The healing has begun at the Sirnics' church, where crime scene
tape was removed from the parsonage around the same time it was
going up around Konvicka's single-story white house over the
weekend. The church entered into a contract with an interim
minister on Monday, hiring the Rev. Ralph Ludwig of El Paso, said
Ted Neely, president of the Weimar United Church of Christ council.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly the fear level is totally different now because of
what's happened'' with Konvicka's death, Neely said.
</P>
<P>
   Some residents are using a label no one has officially attached
to the cases _ ``serial killer'' _ while others alternate between
sorrowful acceptance and a growing cynicism about the erosion of
that quintessential intangible: small town values.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always hear people say 'It never happened here before,' ``
Dwyer said. ``But it's everywhere. Get used to it.''

AGBAYANI HITS TWO HOMERS AS METS WIN BACK NORMALCY
</HEADLINE>

</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New York Mets desperately want some normalcy to
return to their season. After three coaches were dismissed and
Bobby Valentine was sent in an obvious message about his own
status, after the draining series with the Yankees last weekend and
after finally ending their eight-game losing streak on Sunday, the
Mets would love to focus on baseball and nothing else.
</P>
<P>
   Just what is normal for the Mets is still uncertain. Are they a
dysfunctional team that will continue to underachieve and
eventually cost Valentine his managerial job? Are they a talented
team whose starting pitchers will eventually perform better and
push them into post-season contention? No one knows yet.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Benny Agbayani can help the Mets answer those tricky
questions. Maybe Agbayani can continue forcing the fans to chant
``Ben-ny, Ben-ny'' and continue to help guide the Mets back to what
they hope is normalcy. Agbayani ripped two homers as the Mets
silenced the Blue Jays, 8-2, Monday night at Shea Stadium, which,
oddly enough, was almost a normal night for the burly outfielder
who is fast becoming the most popular of Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Following Agbayani's second two-homer game in 19 days, he has
eight homers in 63 at bats this season and has proven again and
again that Valentine must start him every day, erratic glove and
all. Agbayani launched two homers off Roy Halladay, Mike Piazza
also stroked one against the 22-year old and Orel Hershiser was
gritty for six innings as the Mets won their second straight game.
That had not happened since May 25 and 26.
</P>
<P>
   So the Mets managed to exhale for the second night in a row.
Obviously, it will take more than two victories for the Mets to
obscure eight straight games of futility. But there were positive
signs for the Mets. Hershisher hung onto a 2-0 lead the Mets built
in the first by limiting the Jays to three hits in 13 at bats with
men on base, by spearing two sharp grounders to foil rally attempts
and by allowing two earned runs. The 40-year old has won three of
his last four starts and is 5-5.
</P>
<P>
   When Agbayani and Roger Cedeno contributed to Monday night's
victory, Valentine probably felt vindicated since he fielded
questions about his lineup before the game. Even after the Mets
beat Roger Clemens and the Yankees, 7-2, on Sunday, Rickey
Henderson insisted that a cloud of negativity hovered above the
Mets because five outfielders do not fit into three positions. The
attitudes worried him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't get that way,'' said Henderson. ``If we get that way,
you might as well say we're done. We can't win that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Henderson proceeded to claim that he told Valentine he would
monitor the other outfielders and try to stop negativity from
invading the clubhouse. But Valentine did not act like a manager
who is concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's sounds. Yeah, there's sounds,'' said Valentine, when
asked if he noticed negativity. ``Just so you understand, I am not
going to play what I don't think is the best lineup to eliminate
the sounds.''
</P>
<P>
   The only sounds Monday night emanated from rowdy fans at Shea
and they were in favor of the lineup that had Cedeno in right,
Brian McRae in center and Agbayani in left and Henderson and Bobby
Bonilla left out. How can Valentine not start Agbayani? How about
Cedeno? Cedeno had three hits, scored a run and pilfered his major
league best 31st base while Agbayani blasted a homer in the fourth
to break a 2-2 tie and crushed another in his next at bat.
Agbayani, who was intentionally walked before he could shoot for
three straight, has 22 hits in his last 46 at bats. For a 27-year
old who had 22 days of service in the majors before this year,
Agbayani's ascent has been astounding.
</P>
<P>
   Which outfielders sit today? Valentine already told Henderson he
is playing and it will be almost impossible for him to bench
Agbayani or Cedeno. It is a dilemma that will follow Valentine all
summer if the Mets do not move any outfielders. But it will be much
easier for Valentine if the Mets find what they hope is normalcy
and keep winning.

   Sprawl explanations _ unlike solutions _ abound
</P>
<P>
   BY TOM BAXTER
</P>
<P>
   C. 1999 COX NEWS SERVICE
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Should they run out of conversation starters, the new
members of the Georgia Regional Transportation Authority might want
to look at an article by a University of Kentucky professor,
Jefferson Edgens, on how estate taxes cause sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   Edgens' thesis, buttressed with statistics from Georgia, is that
by forcing the inheritors of family farms into selling out to
developers sooner than they would have, estate taxes have speeded
the process by which farmland and open space get converted into
shopping centers and subdivisions.
</P>
<P>
   Not to say he doesn't have a point _ estate taxes do have a
pernicious effect on small businesses and family farms. But Edgens'
argument illustrates a primary difficulty the GRTA board will face
as it sets about its task: It's a lot easier to come up with novel
explanations for how we got in this mess than it is to propose
realistic solutions for getting us out of it.
</P>
<P>
   Since he named the board last week, Gov. Roy Barnes _ who has
thus far been on an extended honeymoon _ has taken lumps from
various corners for naming a board with noticeably little
representation from CEOs, environmentalists or community activists.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes seemed unperturbed by the criticism Monday at a
conference on public transit at Georgia State.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not about bringing a halt to growth,'' the governor
said at a luncheon session. ``Georgia and Atlanta need to continue
to grow. It's how we grow that is at issue.''
</P>
<P>
   It's interesting to compare GRTA with the Education Review
Commission, also named last week.
</P>
<P>
   The ed board also has some notable omissions, with little
representation from the state's big education interest groups. Like
GRTA, it is stamped with a big ``RB'' monogram: Loyalty to the
governor was obviously not a detriment to getting on either board.
It follows that Barnes will be accountable for the success or
failure of both.
</P>
<P>
   One big difference is that GRTA, about which there was much more
speculation before it was named, has 15 members, while the
relatively less heralded Education Review Commission has a whopping
63, with Barnes himself as chairman.
</P>
<P>
   This suggests that on educational issues, Barnes is content to
let a thousand flowers bloom, generating a lot of ideas and culling
from them as he puts his legislative agenda in place.
</P>
<P>
   GRTA, on the other hand, seems more like a limited-access
highway, put in place to move things in a direction already
determined.
</P>
<P>
   Sprawl means a lot of different things to different people _ a
point made by Sam Staley, a critic of anti-growth policies, at a
luncheon last week sponsored by the Georgia Public Policy
Foundation (which also published the Edgens paper).
</P>
<P>
   Barnes on Monday offered his own definition. Sprawl isn't
suburban or exurban growth, he said, but ``the failure to recognize
that growth and infrastructure must go hand in hand.''
</P>
<P>
   That failure being obvious to anybody who's ever been in a
mile-long traffic jam at noon on a two-lane in north Fulton, it's
up to the governor and his board to do something about it. And now
is when the rubber meets the road.

EDITORIAL: JOUSTING WITH BELGRADE
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, June 8: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Slobodan Milosevic is a master at using delay, surprise and
confusion to divide his opponents, and he is now using all three to
undermine the peace agreement that he accepted in Belgrade last
week. NATO will prevail in this diplomatic contest if it remains
faithful to the peace deal, retains a reasonable degree of Russian
cooperation and keeps military pressure on Serbian forces until
Milosevic orders them removed from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate obstacle to peace is Belgrade's refusal to accept
a detailed NATO plan for the rapid withdrawal of Serbian forces and
the arrival of international peacekeepers, most of them from the
alliance. Serbian generals balked at the plan over the weekend,
arguing that seven days was not enough time to exit Kosovo. They
also maintained that as many as 15,000 Serbian troops could remain
behind, though no such deal was made in Belgrade, and that
peacekeeping units could not move into the province until the
United Nations Security Council approves the operation. Milosevic
is clearly playing for time, hoping that Russian and Chinese
misgivings about the details, coupled with their veto power in the
Security Council, will lead to more favorable peace terms for
Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   The withdrawal timetable can easily be extended by a week if
Serbian forces in Kosovo lack the fuel required for a speedy
departure, and if roads and bridges hit by NATO bombs must first be
repaired. But all Serbian forces have to leave, as agreed last
week. A small number may return once Kosovo is pacified. NATO
planes should not hesitate to continue bombing Serbian troops in
Kosovo while Milosevic is obstructing peace.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. role in Kosovo is important, but need not be cause for
diluting the peace terms that Milosevic approved. He knew that NATO
would send in a force of 50,000 peacekeepers, including 7,000
Americans. Several thousand Russian soldiers may also participate.
If possible, all the troops should be dispatched under a U.N.
mandate to show the broadest possible support, and Kosovo should be
temporarily placed under U.N. administration. There is no reason
for Russia or China to oppose these measures. If anything, U.N.
involvement would make the foreign presence more palatable for
Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   But the Security Council can become a graveyard for good
intentions. Washington needs to guard against that by insuring that
a Kosovo resolution closely adheres to the peace plan. That means,
among other things, that peacekeeping forces operate under a NATO
chain of command rather than the muddled system the U.N. used in
Bosnia before the Dayton peace agreement. Russian concern about the
peacekeeping force and other issues slowed the drafting of a U.N.
resolution yesterday by Washington and its allies. To encourage
Russian and Chinese cooperation, NATO may need to cut back on
bombing over Serbia itself for now. The endgame with Milosevic is
always difficult, but unless he disowns the peace deal he endorsed,
the mechanics for ending the war in an acceptable way can be worked
out.

 &HT;    EXCLUSIVE: Falcons consider new nest
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ First came the big rock _ Stone Mountain. Then
Southern history was chiseled upon the rock, a park was built
around it and a laser show created.
</P>
<P>
   And now Stone Mountain's attractions may also include the
Atlanta Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   Team officials have signed a letter of intent with Stone
Mountain Park, and with the private company that manages the park,
to build a training complex at the recreation area. Under the
agreement, Silver Dollar City, a Branson, Mo., company that
specializes in managing theme parks, would build a training
facility there and then lease the facility and about 30 acres to
the Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   The area will be leased because the park is owned by the state,
and none of its 3,200 acres can be sold without an act of the state
Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Nobis, Falcons vice president of corporate development,
said it is premature to assume that the deal is done.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a nonbinding letter of intent,'' said Nobis, who is in
charge of the project. ``We have essentially given them additional
time to . . . research to see if they can deliver what they say
they can. It's not a big story yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The most obvious benefit is that the team could have someone
else pay to build a 70,000-square-foot office building and locker
room, multiple practice fields and a domed 80-yard practice field _
all at a price tag expected to be well above $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons also might have marketing opportunities _ such as a
gift shop, and/or Hall of Fame _ that don't exist at the team's
outdated 21-year-old facility in Suwanee, in Gwinnett County. About
4 million tourists visit Stone Mountain Park annually.
</P>
<P>
   It was the same sales pitch heard by the Braves when they made
Disney World their spring training home in 1998. The Braves moved
their spring training site from West Palm Beach, Fla., to the
Disney complex just outside Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   Stone Mountain, located about 15 miles east of downtown Atlanta,
was a late-comer to the process, entering the race two months ago
after the Falcons had narrowed their list of potential sites. The
other six sites _ two each in Barrow and Hall counties, one in
Forsyth and another in Suwanee _ could not offer the same benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The facility is expected to be built near the old Stone Mountain
Airport, east of the mountain. The airport closed in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an excellent site because nothing has to be taken down,
and it's flat,'' said Ned Stancliff, senior vice president of
Silver Dollar City. ``The details of how we cross-market are to be
worked out, but it's the No. 1 tourist attraction in the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very honored and flattered that the Falcons would even
consider us. All the parties involved have worked extremely hard to
get the Falcons to be in Stone Mountain.''
</P>
<P>
   Those groups included the Atlanta Convention and Business
Bureau, the state Department of Industry, Trade and Tourism, the
Atlanta Sports Council and the DeKalb County Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Stone Mountain officials ``are going to build a facility for
(the Falcons), period,'' Suwanee Mayor Chris Yoder said. Suwanee
had proposed that the Falcons move about 3 miles north and remain
in the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's economics,'' Yoder said. ``How can you beat that? Do I
like it? No. How is that going to affect people who go to the park?
Are ticket prices going to go up at the park to pay for this? I
better not say more. The Falcons have been a very good neighbor.''
</P>
<P>
   The team has outgrown the 20,000-square-foot building it moved
into in 1978. Also, the value of the complex's more than 100 acres
_ along I-85 about 28 miles northeast of downtown Atlanta _ has
skyrocketed.
</P>
<P>
   Nobis said the notion that construction could begin in late July
or early August _ a must if the team is going to move in before the
2000 season _ is still just that, a notion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We intend to build a state-of-the-art facility, but . . .
we've got a lot of work to do,'' Nobis said.

EDITORIAL: HUMILIATION FOR A SCOTTISH BANK 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, June 8: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Bank of Scotland has emerged thoroughly embarrassed from its
ill-fated effort to get into consumer banking in the United States
in partnership with Pat Robertson, the television evangelist and
politician.
</P>
<P>
   The bank, which pioneered telephone banking in Scotland in
partnership with a grocery chain, agreed in March to start a
similar venture with Robertson. The hope was that it could combine
its expertise in dealing with customers via telephone and the
Internet with Robertson's mailing lists and ability to reach people
through his ``700 Club'' religious program.
</P>
<P>
   Then Robertson used that program to denigrate Scotland as ``a
dark place,'' adding that ``you can't believe how strong the
homosexuals are'' in Scotland. That made the front page of a
Scottish newspaper and provoked anger both from gay rights groups
and from Scottish citizens. Public pressure grew, and the Bank of
Scotland announced over the weekend it was backing out of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement added that, in accordance with its contract
with Robertson, the bank was buying out his stake in the venture.
Neither the bank nor Robertson will comment on just how much that
will cost the bank, but it is remarkable that the bank must pay
even though it was Robertson's comments that scuttled the deal.
</P>
<P>
   It will be interesting to see whether Robertson, having gained
not only money but, perhaps, details of how to organize and operate
such a bank, now starts a similar venture without the Bank of
Scotland. (His spokesman would not comment on Robertson's plans.)
The bank, for its part, needs to be more careful both in its choice
of partners and in the contracts it signs with them.

EDITORIAL: A DUBIOUS CHOICE AS HEALTH CHIEF 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, June 8: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki's decision to name Antonia Novello as New
York state's new health commissioner has drawn angry responses from
Planned Parenthood and other abortion rights groups _ and for good
reason. In selecting Dr. Novello, a strong opponent of abortion
rights, to oversee the state agency in charge of insuring access to
the full range of reproductive health care, the ostensibly
pro-choice governor was plainly thinking more about improving his
standing in the national Republican Party than his duty to protect
the reproductive freedom of New York women.
</P>
<P>
   No one disputes Dr. Novello's strengths. A pediatrician by
training, she campaigned strongly against the marketing of tobacco
and alcohol products to young people while she was President Bush's
Surgeon General. As commissioner she will make important day-to-day
decisions, many of them beyond public scrutiny, that affect the
availability of abortion services. Dr. Novello, who opposes
abortion except in cases of rape, incest or a threat to the health
of the mother, said her beliefs would not compromise her
performance. But one important duty of hers will be to enforce
rules mandating that providers of Medicaid managed care make
available referrals for abortion services. It is hard to believe
that someone who supported Bush's ``gag rule,'' prohibiting workers
at family planning programs receiving federal aid from even
discussing abortion with their patients, would approach this
particular obligation with much vigor.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Novello's approval by the Republican-controlled State Senate
seems assured. But before confirmation she should be required to
explain how she plans to reconcile her anti-choice views with the
state's pro-choice policies. She can begin to reassure her critics
by promising now to preserve the special unit in the health
department that works to advance quality reproductive services.
Pataki says Dr. Novello's nomination is not a retreat from his
generally pro-choice stance. The proof will be in her performance.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Gores and Clintons shared a stage for two hours
at the White House Conference on Mental Health on Monday, and took
turns interviewing people who have struggled with mental illness as
a patient, parent or researcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the last great stigma of the 20th century that we need
to make sure ends here and now,'' said Tipper Gore, who ran the
show. She recently revealed that she had been clinically depressed
after her son, Albert, nearly died when he was hit by a car in 1989
when he was 6. ``I was not myself,'' she said of her own
experience, until she sought medical help, including medication.
``I'm happy to say that it worked.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton asked Congress on Monday to ensure that
Americans with mental illness get the same insurance benefits for
treating depression as they do for treating physical ailments like
asthma, and announced that the federal government would now make
sure that employees are covered for mental illness just as they are
for any other malady. On Monday, the government sent a letter to
285 participating health plans telling them they must comply.
</P>
<P>
   The president also announced that 1,000 schools would get free
satellite programming on dealing with students prone to violence,
and announced several other programs for mentally ill homeless
people, elderly people and young Native American people.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been too long since we've come together over something
this real that touches so many of us,'' he said, and praised the
Gores by saying that while most politicians talk about family
values, ``no couple in public life has ever done remotely as much
to try and figure out how to help families.''
</P>
<P>
   The conference, held at Howard University, was attended by
several hundred people and included several events throughout the
day.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gore is the president's mental health adviser, and bounded
upon the stage as if pumped as for a political rally, giving the
thumbs-up and even jumping a little at one point.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting side by side for two hours, the family dynamic between
the Clintons and the Gores, at a time when Al Gore has been
portrayed as competing with Hillary Clinton as campaign season
approaches, ranged from supportive to adoring.
</P>
<P>
   Each nodded attentively at the others' remarks, and Mrs. Gore
introduced Hillary Clinton by saying that when it came to shedding
light on new research about how the brain works, ``no one could do
that any better than the sunshine of all our lives, our first lady,
Hillary Rodham Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton returned the compliment by saying, ``If I had any
voice I'd break into `You Are the Sunshine of My Life,' and
dedicate it to Tipper.''
</P>
<P>
   In her role as moderator, Mrs. Gore choreographed both Clintons
and her husband, at one point telling the vice president, ``You
might want to get up and go over now,'' pointing him toward a
corner where he was to interview two more people about their
experiences with mental illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, ma'am,'' he told her, laughing. ``I'm anxious to follow
instructions carefully, but to depart from my destruct _ or, to
depart from my instructions, I want to say I hope you can see how
proud I am of Tipper.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gore began the program by interviewing Mike Wallace, of
television's ``60 Minutes,'' about his experience with depression,
sitting beside him and repeatedly patting his hand and arm as he
spoke. When, at one point, Wallace tried to break off, saying, ``I
don't want to monopolize this,'' Mrs. Gore urged him to continue,
saying, ``It's important because you're a man and you come forward
and you can help so many men.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in effect on trial for my life, a libel trial,'' Wallace
told the crowd, describing the nightmare of spending weeks in a
courtroom where the case was being heard, and of being grilled by
other journalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, now, we love our friends in the press,'' Mrs. Gore
interjected.
</P>
<P>
   He went on, saying, ``I was lower than a snake's belly,'' and
described how he took to calling his doctor late at night,
wondering what was wrong, only to be told, basically, to buck up.
He was eventually hospitalized, and after winning the libel case,
relapsed because he went off his medicine. Now, on medication ``for
the rest of my life, I feel better up here than ever in my life,''
Wallace said, pointing to his head.
</P>
<P>
   As President and Mrs. Clinton listened intently to the story,
they were mirror images of one another, each holding one finger in
the crook of their chins.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also seemed riveted by the story of a young woman who
had battled anorexia, once limiting herself to only 20 calories a
day, less than half an apple, and doing situps until her back was
covered with sores. ``How much weight did you lose?'' the president
asked her. ``How much did you weigh?''
</P>
<P>
   When it came Gore's turn to interview a mother whose
eighth-grader has bipolar disorder, he sounded a little like a
therapist himself: ``What I hear you saying is that anyone who
talks about how important it is for families to stay together and
be strong ought to also be supportive of families in these
situations.''
</P>
<P>
   He also spoke to a medical director who found that providing
preventive treatment and full mental health benefits saved his
company money, and again spoke about how his wife had helped
educate him on mental health issues over the years.
</P>
<P>
   Then Mrs. Clinton led a discussion with researchers and Rep.
Lynn Rivers, D-Mich., who said that drugs to treat her bipolar
disorder had at one time eaten up half of her family's income.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the president spoke, saying he was educated on mental
illness by reading the work of the novelist William Styron, then
adding, ``but it is not enough to be moved.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I sort of feel like an anticlimax at this convention _ and not
for the reasons the political reporters think,'' he said, praising
those who had told their stories.
</P>
<P>
   In the afternoon, the Gores hosted what they called a town
meeting on the theme of ``busting myths'' about mental illness, and
Gore appeared to go off script to discuss a conversation he had had
with a nun at the conference earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another myth,'' Gore said, ``is that if you pray hard enough,
if you get your relationship with God in order, that's going to
handle this. For those of us who are religious, that's the first
thing we turn to, but ... if you needed a heart transplant, you
wouldn't think, `If I just pray harder, it will take the place of a
new heart.' You need to work with God.''

SABRES WON'T BE SWEPT AWAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Stanley Cup Finals have arrived, good news for hockey
fanatics who lack a well-rounded existence because the onset of the
NHL's championship series means next season's training camps open
in a mere 13 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   After the Dallas Stars and Buffalo Sabres complete their
best-of-seven series, which begins tonight in Dallas, there'll be
just enough time to melt the old ice before making a new patch.
</P>
<P>
   The question now is whether the Finals once again will produce
another sweeps week, one markedly different from TV's traditional
sweeps weeks, which produce high Nielsen ratings and plenty of
melodrama.
</P>
<P>
   Hockey's sweeps weeks the past four years have been the Stanley
Cup Finals _ four series completed in the minimum four games,
devoid of drama and earning Nielsen ratings just a few degrees
warmer than those of the Weather Channel.
</P>
<P>
   The natural inclination is to predict that this year's
championship series will be more of the same.
</P>
<P>
   From the Western Conference _ which has won the past 12 Stanley
Cup Finals games _ come the Stars, who had the best regular-season
record in the NHL. You would never get Dallas players to admit it,
but it wouldn't be unreasonable if some were thinking they won the
Stanley Cup last week when they defeated the Colorado Avalanche in
the seventh game of the Western Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   From the Eastern Conference _ which last won a Stanley Cup in
1995, when New Jersey swept Detroit _ come the Sabres, who unfairly
and inaccurately are portrayed as Dominik Hasek and a bland helping
of Buffalo wings and defensemen.
</P>
<P>
   The easy thing to do would be to predict a Dallas sweep, which
would bring the Stanley Cup south of Philadelphia for the first
time in history.
</P>
<P>
   The gutsy thing to do would be to predict that the Sabres will
succeed in the NHL where the Buffalo Bills failed four times in the
NFL.
</P>
<P>
   We'll cop out and take the middle ground: Dallas will win the
Stanley Cup, but it won't be a sweep. The Stars will take more than
four games to beat the Sabres, but ultimately they will overwhelm
Buffalo with physical play and stifling defense.
</P>
<P>
   Before they finish off the Sabres, however, the Stars will have
a tussle. Buffalo's biggest strength is its lack of dependence on
any one player, which has allowed its goalie to become its most
identifiable performer. Because of Hasek, and because the Sabres
play so well together, it is irrelevant that Dallas finished first
overall with 114 points, 23 more than Buffalo, which finished
seventh in an Eastern Conference that is much stronger top to
bottom than the West.
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres had little trouble knocking off three higher-seeded
teams in the Eastern Conference, and have been resting and healing
for more than a week since eliminating the Toronto Maple in five
games to reach the Finals.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars, on the other hand, were taken to six games by St.
Louis and seven bruising and emotional games by the Avalanche, and
enter tonight's opener with a just-right four days' rest, which
might give them an early advantage over the potentially stale
Sabres.
</P>
<P>
   Over a long series, however, the strengths and weaknesses of the
teams will be what matters, not how much time each side had off.
And the reality is that the Stars' edge is not as pronounced as one
might think.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars are the deeper team, but not by much, and the Sabres
have an edge in speed. If forwards such as Brian Holzinger, Geoff
Sanderson, Miroslav Satan and captain Michael Peca can enter the
Stars' zone with speed, Dallas will have a difficult task
consistently stopping them.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the Stars have received major postseason
contributions not only from predictable sources such as Mike Modano
and Joe Nieuwendyk, but also from role players such as Jamie
Langenbruner, Dave Reid and Mike Keane.
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres have more depth, too, than they're given credit for,
and it becomes increasingly evident that productive third and
fourth lines are the true key to success in the playoff marathon.
</P>
<P>
   The past two seasons, when Detroit won the Cup, Steve Yzerman
and Sergei Fedorov got the headlines, but the Red Wings' edge came
from players such as Darren McCarty, Kris Draper and Martin
Lapointe.
</P>
<P>
   Almost as important as depth are special teams, and this series
will present an intriguing faceoff of Buffalo's potent and
consistent power play and Dallas' outstanding penalty-killing unit.
If one side dominates the other in this aspect of the game, that
team will lift the Stanley Cup within the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   An intriguing and depressing sidelight to this series for
followers of the Kings is the presence of two defensemen who should
have helped lead them into the new millennium and the Staples
Center.
</P>
<P>
   Six years ago as rookies, Darryl Sydor and Alexei Zhitnik helped
lead the Kings to their only appearance in the Finals. Within three
years, both had been traded, and since then, both have become
mainstays on their subsequent teams, Sydor with the Stars and
Zhitnik with the Sabres.
</P>
<P>
   Now, six years later, Sydor or Zhitnik finally will win a
Stanley Cup, because there's no way both can be done in by the
illegal curvature of a hockey stick.
</P>
<P>
   And Sydor will be the fortunate one, because he plays for a
veteran team built to win the Cup this year, a team that has been
preparing for this moment for the past few years, a team with
offensive depth that also can play defense so tight that
goaltending becomes irrelevant. Dallas goalie Ed Belfour is far
from irrelevant, but inevitably will be overshadowed by Hasek, the
international hockey hero.
</P>
<P>
   It will take six games before the Stars finish off Hasek and the
Sabres.
</P>
<P>
   Sydor and his teammates better enjoy it while they can. It will
be June 19 when the Stars win the Cup, and training camp will be
only 11 weeks away. &QL;

SPEAKER PLANS SPEECH TO UNITE HOUSE GOP 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Speaker Dennis Hastert will meet with House
Republicans on Tuesday in what is being described by party members
as a very pointed political pep talk and an effort to strengthen
his own position as a leader.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert will express his views ``on where we are and where we
need to go,'' a spokesman for Hastert, Pete Jeffries, said on
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffries said he could not comment on a report in The Washington
Post on Tuesday that the speaker's get-tough speech had been
prompted by his worries that the party could lose control of the
House if dissension within the ranks continued.
</P>
<P>
   The Post reported that Hastert planned to tell Republican
conservative dissidents that they could be undermining their
party's future unless they rallied behind his agenda. It is no
secret that the speaker has been worried by a lack of party unity
on issues like health care, taxes and domestic spending.
</P>
<P>
   A close ally of the speaker, Rep. Ray LaHood, was quoted by The
Post as saying that Hastert needed to realize that part of being a
leader was ``putting your fist on the table and saying, `O.K.,
folks, I've listened to everybody and here's what we're going to
do.''' LaHood is from Hastert's home state, Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert's brief tenure as speaker has been marked by paradox, in
a way. He has kept a low profile _ deliberately, many people on
Capitol Hill have said _ and he has not seemed to be a political
disciplinarian. Yet he is a bear of a man, physically, and was a
high school wrestling coach.
</P>
<P>
   Asked on Monday night whether the speaker's private address to
his troops should be described as an effort to sharpen an agenda,
or an effort to rally emotional support, or an old-fashioned
coach's pep talk, Jeffries replied, ``A little of each.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeffries said the meeting had been foreshadowed by weeks of
meetings Hastert has held with House Republicans on the budget
process. The spokesman described the meetings as collegial
``listening sessions'' with party members, both conservatives and
moderates.
</P>
<P>
   It has been widely reported that Hastert returned from the
Memorial Day recess determined to rewrite Republican spending
plans, shifting some money from military spending and into social
programs like health and education. The House is far behind in its
work on more than a dozen appropriations measures to finance the
government for the fiscal year 2000, which begins Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker's problems are interlocking and, in a way,
contradictory. He must try to restore some domestic spending cuts
to please moderate Republicans and enough Democrats to pass
legislation, yet he does not want to risk infuriating his party's
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, he wants to unite his party enough so that
Republicans do not lose the House they won in 1994 after four
decades in the wilderness.

PAVANO DEALS SOX A SETBACK 
</HEADLINE>
 BB-RED SOX-EXPOS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ As a rags-to-riches tale, Carl Pavano has been the
rags in this deal, while Pedro Martinez has amassed the riches.
</P>
<P>
   But lest anyone rush to judgment too soon about the trade in
which Red Sox prospect Pavano and Expos star Martinez swapped
uniforms two years ago, this public service reminder: Pavano is
still only 23 years old.
</P>
<P>
   And while Martinez is making a compelling case that he is a
pitcher for the ages, Pavano reminded the Red Sox Monday night that
given a little time, he might mature into the pitcher Dan Duquette
thought he would be back when Pavano was twinned with Brian Rose as
Boston's hopes for the future.
</P>
<P>
   Pavano gave up a two-run home run to Brian Daubach in the first
inning, then shut out the Red Sox on four hits until the ninth in
what turned into a Canadian carpet cleaning, an 8-2 Montreal win
before a gathering small enough (7,003) to cram into one Metro
train.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's unbelievable, the best pitcher in baseball,'' Pavano said
of the man for whom he was traded in November 1997. ``Sometimes I
think to myself, `What were they thinking?' That's an honest
question.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, he is amazing. If they're looking at me to become that
kind of pitcher one day, I'm going to have work at being the best I
can be. My goal is to be the best, to set precedents, make an
impact on the game. I don't just want to say that I was a major
leaguer.''
</P>
<P>
   The Expos, who began the night 13 games under .500 and as losers
of as many games (33) as the Sox had won, took turns tattooing Bret
Saberhagen, who hasn't won since Patriots Day, and relievers Derek
Lowe and John Wasdin to send the Sox to their third straight loss,
the first time since May 5 the Sox have hung that many L's in
succession.
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen, a week into his return from the disabled list, was
hit early and often by the Expos, who numbered two doubles, two
triples, and a home run in the first four innings among their nine
hits off Saberhagen, who went six.
</P>
<P>
   The home run, a two-run shot that gave the Expos a 4-2 lead in
the third, was struck by Orlando Merced and was one more hit than
he had in the five weeks he was with the Red Sox last summer.
Merced, who came to the Sox in a trading-deadline deal with the
Twins last July 31, had only nine at-bats before being released by
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, he forgot his contact lenses on his way to the ballpark,
but his wife came to his rescue in time for him to make connections
against Saberhagen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big thing was with my off-speed pitches,'' said
Saberhagen, who saw the Expos double their advantage the inning
after he left with a two-out rally against Lowe, who walked two
batters with two out and nobody on, then put the Sox away with
Orlando Cabrera's two-run home run off Wasdin in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was leaving everything up in the zone,'' Saberhagen said.
``That's when they really did a lot of damage. It was almost like I
was putting the ball on a tee, the way they were hitting.
</P>
<P>
   ``And what hurt me most is when I fell behind Merced, 3 and 0.
He's hit me well in the past, but you don't want to walk him and
put runners on first and second with (Vladimir) Guerrero coming up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I threw him fastballs and he missed a bunch of them, but then
he got one.''
</P>
<P>
   Pavano, who suffered the humiliation of a 15-0 beating by the
Sox and Martinez last July in Fenway Park, allowed six hits, walked
one, and struck out five while pitching into the ninth inning for
the first time in his fledgling big-league career.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to tip your hat to Pavano,'' Saberhagen said.
``We'd just gotten a two-spot early, and he was able to shut us
down the rest of the game. He really kept us off balance all night.
He threw a great game.''
</P>
<P>
   One day, Pavano said, he'd like to be remembered for more than
this double negative: The Man Who Was Traded for Martinez, and The
Man Who Gave Up Mark McGwire's 70th.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, it was sweeter beating Boston, the team that traded
me,'' said Pavano, whose record is an exceedingly modest 4-5 with
an indecent 6.29 ERA even after beating the Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to stay away from making headlines about giving up
home runs. I've just got to keep working hard, keep my head on
straight. For really everyone, the sky is the limit, as long as you
can stay healthy.''

HELP ON THE WAY FOR SPARKS

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The two highly regarded Yugoslavian players
expected to join the Sparks' training camp roster late will be
arriving in Los Angeles today and have one day to practice with the
team before the season opener Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But still, the 5-foot-10 guard Gordana Grubin and 6-6 center
Nina Bjedov are expected to make the 11-player cut Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The pair has been with the Yugoslavian national team competing
in the European Championships, which concluded Sunday in Poland.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks coach Orlando Woolridge saw both last year when he was an
assistant coach on the USA Basketball women's national team.
Woolridge speaks highly of Grubin, 26, who can play the point or
shooting guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``She really impressed me,'' he said. ``We had Shannon Johnson
on her, who I feel is one of the best defensive guards in the
league, we had Nikki McCray, we had Sheryl Swoopes ... we had some
of our best perimeter players on her and she was just a dominating
force.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks will have five guards in camp with Grubin joining.
She is expected to put pressure on point guards Penny Toler and
Jamila Wideman. Rookie Ukari Figgs has received the nod as the
starting point guard.
</P>
<P>
   Bjedov will help in the low post.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's 6-6, a very good body, and does a great job of shooting
the ball from outside facing up,'' Woolridge said. ``She has good
post moves. She relly understands the game. We're fortunate to have
two other Olympians to join what we have here right now. They have
a style that fits right in.''
</P>
<P>
   Toler, a former All-American from Long Beach State, suffered a
minor sprain left ankle in practice Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The WNBA, three days from opening its third season with 12
teams, announced it will add teams in Miami, Seattle, Indianapolis
and Portland, Ore., next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had not anticipated expanding this quickly,'' WNBA
president Val Ackerman said. ``But the combination of the success
of the league in the first two seasons and the strong interest
expressed by NBA owners has convinced us that the time is right.''
</P>
<P>
   The league opened teams in Detroit and Washington last year and
Orlando and Minnesota this season. The 16 teams in 2000 will double
what the league started with in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks guard Tamecka Dixon, who wrote ``You Can Be A Woman
Basketball Player
</P>
<P>
   '' (Cascade Pass, Inc.), will have a book reading and signing
July 25 at Borders bookstore, 6510 Canoga Ave., in Canoga Park, and
another one will be planned later for August in Torrance.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets for the WNBA All-Star game go on sale today. The tickets
costs $10, $30, $40 and $75 and are available at all Ticketmaster
outlets.
</P>
<P>
   The inaugural game will be held July 14 at Madison Square
Garden.
