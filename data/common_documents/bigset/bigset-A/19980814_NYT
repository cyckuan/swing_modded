LET LETT GO; NOW'S TIME FOR REBUILDING

<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ As is his custom, Leon Lett was here one
day, gone the next.
</P>
<P>
   One minute Tuesday night he was a rolling avalanche, tormenting
the New Orleans Saints' backfield. In the next breath, he was a
limping bystander, watching from the sidelines again.
</P>
<P>
   For the Cowboys, it should have been a reminder fraught with
omens. No Lett, no defensive anchor. No Leon, no chance.
</P>
<P>
   And though new coach Chan Gailey chose to put a positive spin on
the news of Lett's sprained knee _ ``It's an opportunity for
somebody else. It's an opportunity for us to rally, an opportunity
to see how we can handle adversity in another situation'' _ the
fact is that all the opportunity in the world means nothing unless
you have the wherewithal to answer the knock.
</P>
<P>
   I think they don't. I think they're an NFL playoff also-ran.
</P>
<P>
   And if the Cowboys can't march, at least moderately
impressively, to the NFC Championship Game, what's the point?
</P>
<P>
   While waiting for Leon's knee to mend, the prudent alternative
would be to attempt to trade him. Avoid the seemingly annual
substance-abuse suspension. Swap him for both the cow and the bag
of beans.
</P>
<P>
   The eight-year pro's trade value will never be higher. You could
argue that next to the starting quarterback, Lett, 29, might have
the highest sheer trade value on the squad.
</P>
<P>
   Oh? You say that would wreck the defense, and probably the
entire 1998 season?
</P>
<P>
   Indeed it could. And that's exactly my point.
</P>
<P>
   Two lackluster full-dress scrimmages and two tellingly
unimpressive exhibition contests have drained me of all vestiges of
optimism. The new offense still pings instead of purrs. Emmitt
Smith ran like an old memory Tuesday, but be still, thy hearts _ it
was against yon feeble Saints.
</P>
<P>
   And there are better pass rushes on sale days at Mervyn's.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, it is mid-August. In games that truly matter, the
Cowboys remain undefeated.
</P>
<P>
   But shouldn't a team with deep-playoff aspirations be showing
something _ something besides controversial headlines _ even by
now?
</P>
<P>
   If Lett misses any string of regular-season games, either by
knee or indiscretion, the starting front four likely becomes Kavika
Pittman, Antonio Anderson, Chad Hennings and rookie Greg Ellis.
</P>
<P>
   Depth, once a franchise hallmark, has been chipped away by age
and free-agent defections.
</P>
<P>
   While the Cowboys were rolling over and quitting for Barry
Switzer last autumn _ not an altogether unpopular move, of course _
they also were squandering a year of their ``window of
opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   You know the window. From it, the swaggering young Cowboys once
thought they could see four, six, even nine or 10 Super Bowls.
</P>
<P>
   Now they're a year older, with a 6-10 blotch on their resumes.
From the window of opportunity, on a clear day, the Cowboys can
barely see beyond Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   Trade Lett? Better think about it. And why not trade Michael
Irvin and Deion Sanders, if someone would dare bite the bait?
</P>
<P>
   I am preaching to the mortician, of course. Owner Jones would
never flush the season in August. Pepsi and Nike, to name two,
would be horrified.
</P>
<P>
   But if this team pales on paper against the likes of Green Bay
and San Francisco, what's the point?
</P>
<P>
   For two decades, former coach Tom Landry and general manager Tex
Schramm harvested success by having the boldness and foresight to
replace veterans one year early. Replace them one year late, and
you wind up like the Cowboys that Owner Jones inherited.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, let me suggest, has already learned this. A major purge
of old faces has already begun _ Bill Bates, Tony Tolbert, Mark
Tuinei, et al.
</P>
<P>
   But Jones, the eternal wildcatter, seems to think that by
drafting Flozell Adams and bringing in veteran hands such as Chris
Warren, Ernie Mills and George Teague, he can prop open the golden
window one more time.
</P>
<P>
   Salary cap constraints would complicate any mass fire sale.
Lett's contract, however, would not be a burdensome one to unload.
It calls for $2.25 million in 1998 and would cost $3.1 million
against the salary cap this season, but only $850,000 the next.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for a Pro Bowl lineman like Lett, the Cowboys could
launch their renovation effort with, say, two high draft picks _
picks that could eventually exchange for the next Leon Lett.
</P>
<P>
   It's what a team with Super Bowl dreams needs to do.
</P>
<P>
   If a window looks like it's closing, in other words, it opens
another one.

BOEING ANNOUNCES CONSOLIDATION PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KAREN WEST and JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Moving agressively on several fronts to return the
company to more profitable times and restore its tarnished image on
Wall Street, Boeing on Thursday announced sweeping consolidations
of its defense and space facilities in Kent, Wash., and elsewhere,
and said it will begin producing new 737s on a Southern California
assembly line in October.
</P>
<P>
   Although it was not specific on how many more jobs will be cut,
Boeing said it will further trim its work force in 2000. This would
be on top of previously announced plans to eliminate as many as
28,000 jobs companywide by the end of next year. Current employment
totals about 238,000 in 27 states.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's Information, Space &AMP; Defense Systems plans to cut its
workforce companywide by up to 10,000 over the next 5 years. Some
but not all of those jobs are included in the 28,000 figure.
</P>
<P>
   And Boeing reiterated that it will reduce commercial airplane
employment in the Seattle area by about 12,000. Those jobs are
included in the 28,000 figure.
</P>
<P>
   ``These were not easy decisions to make because they affect the
people of Boeing,'' Chairman Phil Condit told employees in an
internal bulletin.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some instances we will be closing facilities. In other
cases, we will be moving work from one site to another. And jobs
will be reduced in the process. However, these were essential
decisions to make. They will allow us to reduce our costs, operate
more efficiently and better meet the needs of our customers.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcement that Boeing will start a new 737 final assembly
line for its business jets in Long Beach had been the subject of
much media attention in recent months. But industry analysts said
the real message yesterday is that through a series of cost-cutting
moves and consolidation of facilities, the company hopes to boost
profits.
</P>
<P>
   In all, Boeing will close more than 18 million square feet of
office, warehouse and manufacturing space by the end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Mainly due to production problems on its commercial airplane
lines in Renton and in Everett, north of Seattle, Boeing posted its
first annual loss in 50 years in 1997. Its stock has been battered
on Wall Street and the company has been forced to deny recent
rumors that Condit will be ousted along with Ron Woodard, president
of the Commercial Airplane Group.
</P>
<P>
   A 737 assembly line in California would be a first since World
War II for Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of Boeing's largest union, which earlier had threatened
legal action to block the California assembly line, said they
reached a ``landmark'' agreement with the company after a series of
unprecedented talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe this agreement gives our members the job security
they demand and they need,'' said Bill Johnson, president of the
Machinists local that represents 39,000 Boeing workers. ``We do not
believe the battle should be between the union and the company. The
battleground should between Boeing and Airbus.''
</P>
<P>
   In conjunction with the introduction of the 737 work, the
commercial airplane operation in California is being renamed the
Long Beach division. It has been known as the Douglas Products
Division.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, Boeing promised the union it will produce
no more than five next-generation 737s a month at Long Beach at
least until after the current contract expires Sept. 1, 1999.
Boeing also promised that no union-represented employees in the
Puget Sound area, Spokane, Wichita, Kansas, or Portland will be
laid off for the duration of the current labor contract as a result
of the Long Beach line and pledged to keep production of 737 wings
and other components in the Puget Sound area, and to continue
building fuselage sections in Wichita.
</P>
<P>
   Both Johnson and Boeing executives said their successful talks
have paved the way for smoother labor negotiations next year. In
1995, talks broke down and the Machinists went on strike for 69
days. ``I see this (success) carrying into the negotiations,''
Johnson said. ``I would like to see this as a way of doing
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Calhoun, Boeing vice president of employee and union
relations, agreed, saying: ``I would hope that the formal round in
the fall of next year is a non-event, and that's what we're
striving to have happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Fred Mitchell, an executive vice president of Boeing's
commercial airplane group, said assembly at the Long Beach plant
will begin in October and will be used initially to produce Boeing
Business Jets, a corporate version of the 737-700.
</P>
<P>
   He said about 600 workers in California will be needed for the
new line. The production rate will increase gradually to three
airplanes per month by the second quarter of 1999 with the addition
of selected next-generation 737s for airline customers.
</P>
<P>
   Later next year, the new line could begin producing convertible
freighters known as 737-700Cs. He said the move would give the
company the capability to move beyond the currently planned peak
737 production rate of 27 a month if market conditions demand.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the plans for Long Beach, much of Boeing's
defense and space consolidation will occur in southern California,
which has become home to the company's growing space business.
</P>
<P>
   Kent will see several changes, though it will continue as
headquarters for the defense and space group that is now called
Information, Space &AMP; Defense Systems. But the headquarters of
Boeing's information and communications systems unit in Kent will
move to Anaheim, Calif. Fewer than 100 people are affected.
</P>
<P>
   And Boeing's work on the Teledesic ``Internet in the Sky''
satellite project will shift to Seal Beach, Calif. Boeing's role
was greatly diminished recently when Motorola took over as prime
contractor.
</P>
<P>
   As the Post-Intelligencer first reported Monday, Boeing tabbed
St. Louis as the location for all future fighter aircraft
production. This includes the Joint Strike Fighter should Boeing
win the heated competition over Lockheed Martin in three years.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing hinted in its announcement that its present work on the
F-22 stealth fighter, which it makes in partnership with Lockheed
Martin, could eventually move out of the Seattle area. About 1,400
workers now build the wings and aft fuselage of the next-generation
stealth fighter at facilities near Boeing Field. Sources said that
work would be moved, probably to St. Louis, only if Boeing
determined it would make good business sense to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The consolidation plans are a result of the many facilities and
programs Boeing acquired last year from McDonnell Douglas and its
purchase in late 1996 of the space business of Rockwell
International in Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Mulally, president of Boeing's Information, Space &AMP; defense
Systsems, said in an internal message to employees that the moves
and consolidations will save about $1.6 billion over the next 5
years.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Boeing announced it would cut about 2,000 jobs from
its Information, Space &AMP; Defense Systsems. Those would be included
in the 5,000 to 10,000 jobs that Boeing plans to eliminate in its
space and defense business over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   Southern California will experience the brunt of the defense and
space consolidations.
</P>
<P>
   All Boeing operations now in Downey will be moved to other areas
in Southern California, including Huntington Beach and Anaheim.
Most of the facilities in Downey now occupied by Boeing are owned
by NASA, which had wanted Boeing out so the buildings could sold as
part of its own cost-savings consolidations.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing laboratory facilities across the country will be reduced
from about 600 to 450, Mulally said.
</P>
<P>
   The company will close laboratories in Downey, Long Beach,
Palmdale and Canoga Park, and some other Southern California
operations will be moved to new locations in the region. Boeing did
not say how many jobs might be affected by those moves.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's news was greeted by cheers in Long Beach. The new
production line will preserve about 600 jobs otherwise targeted for
elimination as Boeing ends production of the MD-80, MD-90 and MD-11
planes now built at the plant.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, California Gov. Pete Wilson said the decision by
Boeing to build 737 planes in Long Beach could eventually result in
more than the 600 jobs now projected. He noted that Boeing has
backorders for about 1,000 next generation 737s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pleased that the good folks at Boeing have chosen Long
Beach to build the next generation 737s,'' he said. ``This will
mean an immediate 600 new jobs for the Southland, and even more
jobs as Boeing builds 1,000 of these aircfart ... Boeing didn't
chose us so they could take their lunch breaks at the beach. They
were impressed by out skilled workforce and the ability of the
state and the city to work together to produce a winning offer.''
</P>
<P>
   California's trade and commerce department has been working
closely with Boeing on a multimillion economic incentive package,
but people familiar with the talks said nothing has been signed.
</P>
<P>
   ``California stands ready to do everything possible for Boeing
on an incentive package,'' said department spokesman Jesus
Arredondo. ``We have been working with them on and off, and now
with the 737 announcement we will re-engage 100 percent and see
what we can come up with.''

SONY VIDEO CAMERA CAN SEE THROUGH CLOTHING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LISA VAN PROYEN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- X-ray vision may no longer be limited to
Superman.
</P>
<P>
   The Sony Corp. said Thursday that under certain conditions,
users of its Nightshot-equipped Handycam video cameras can peep
through thin, light-colored clothing and even bathing suits.
</P>
<P>
   The revelation has caused a rush of calls to Los Angeles-area
stores that sell the cameras, which cost from $600 to $1,800. But
they won't be available forever, because Sony has modified all of
its new cameras so they cannot be used by video peepers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It recently came to Sony's attention that this Nightshot
feature has an unintended capability to see through clothing under
certain conditions,'' said Hiro Takahashi, a Sony Corp. spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are still keeping the Nightshot function so it works in
darkness, but it has been modified so that it cannot be activated
in daylight,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sony said it was as surprised as anyone. It designed the
infrared feature to capture such innocent moments as sleeping
babies or nocturnal animals. But with an inexpensive gelatin
filter, a Nightshot-equipped camera can see through some clothing,
Takahashi said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It requires certain conditions,'' he said. ``So an image taken
in daylight or a similar type of brightness -- and depending on the
thickness or color of the clothing -- under these conditions you
can see through clothing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Handycam's unintended use came to light first in an article
in Takarajima, a popular Japanese men's magazine. From there the
word spread -- quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Would-be video voyeurs were quick to call up electronic stores
throughout the L.A. area in hopes of finding one of the 400,000
Handycams that Sony shipped to North America.
</P>
<P>
   And store employees were also quick to try it out for
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Samy's Camera in Hollywood received 20 calls Thursday from
people wanting ``the camera that sees through people's clothing,''
said Doug Kim, a video-sales employee.
</P>
<P>
   ``This morning, I was inundated with calls,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But then Kim tried every possible filter to see what he could
see -- and it didn't work, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not going to see through people's clothes,'' he added.
``It's just some science-fiction fantasy. I don't know who's saying
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Kim said he believes that even if it were possible, the picture
would lack true definition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Physically, it's just impossible,'' he said. ``All you would
see would just be blobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Tell that to the dozens of people who called Fry's Electronics
in suburban Woodland Hills to ask about the camera.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wants that camera,'' said one employee who declined
to be named.

BOEING TO LAY OFF 2,300 CONTRACT WORKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KAREN WEST  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ About 2,300 Boeing contract workers in the Puget Sound
area will lose their jobs in the next few weeks as part of the
company's phase-out of its temporary engineering work force in the
commercial aircraft division, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer has
learned.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing already has notified some of the workers and more
termination notices were expected to go out as early as Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Some exceptions could be made for contract workers who are
crucial to production of Boeing commercial aircraft. Boeing
officials are in the process of evaluating the company's contract
labor force to determine how many jobs would remain.
</P>
<P>
   But Boeing spokeswoman Susan Davis confirmed Thursday that a
majority of the 2,300 positions _ nearly all of which are in
engineering _ will be phased out in the next few weeks. She said no
specific timetable has yet been set, although some contract workers
already have been let go.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Peterson, who designs interiors for Boeing widebody
passenger jets in Everett, north of Seattle, said he and dozens of
other contract employees were warned they could lose their jobs
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody feels like they have one foot off the diving
board,'' said Peterson, who just bought a home in Bremerton. ``It's
not a very productive work environment right now. They are letting
experience just walk out the door.''
</P>
<P>
   After a series of management meetings Thursday, Peterson said
his boss still did not know whether the contract workers in his
area would have jobs Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just told us to prepare for the worst,'' said Peterson, who
has worked for Boeing on and off since 1992. ``It's a sad situation
for everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   He said lower-level managers are being put in the awkward
position of having to break the news to their employees, but not
given any specific information.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are going to be left holding the bag when there's nobody
left to build airplanes,'' Peterson said.
</P>
<P>
   The contract employees are among the first of the 12,000
positions Boeing had previously announced it would cut from its
commercial aircraft division beginning this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are doing this to avoid laying off permanent Boeing
employees,'' Davis said. ``The reason we bring these people in is
to keep the permanent work force more stable.''
</P>
<P>
   The contract labor force phase-out, which is not part of the
companywide consolidation announced Thursday, comes just two days
after Boeing Commercial Airplane Group President Ron Woodard
ordered a hiring freeze in the commercial division. He also ordered
managers to limit travel expenditures and to curtail spending on
``non-essential'' items.
</P>
<P>
   Woodard's cost-cutting program is in response to Boeing Chairman
Phil Condit's goal of obtaining a 7 percent net return on sales by
2000 _ a goal the company has so far never been able to achieve.
</P>
<P>
   Companywide, Boeing has about 9,800 contract employees, 3,000 of
whom work for the commercial division's engineering unit. For now,
the only concerted effort to reduce Boeing's temporary labor force
is in its Commercial Airplane Group, which has 118,000 employees
and is based in Renton.
</P>
<P>
   While the contract employees work for Boeing, they are not
considered permanent Boeing employees and do not receive full
company benefits. Instead, they are employed by individual contract
labor firms who offer their own set of benefits and perks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew there would be some reductions but we didn't
anticipate it would be to this extent,'' said Steve Dworkin,
president of Bellevue-based CTS International, a recruiting company
specializing in placing high-tech personnel for aerospace and
telecommunications. ``When Boeing goes through a period of
cost-cutting, it affects us as well.''
</P>
<P>
   He said about 1,000 of the contract employees his firm has
placed with Boeing could be affected by the cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Several weeks ago, Boeing Commercial Airplane Group managers
began studying the need to phase out its contract labor force as
part of overall cost-cutting measures, but until now, no major job
reductions have been made.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike union members, Boeing is not required to give contract
workers advance warning that their jobs will be eliminated,
although the company has given workers early notice in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know they can be let go at any time,'' said Kim Cartland,
account executive with Butler Service Group in Redmond, one of the
10 consulting companies Boeing uses to find engineering and
technical contract workers.
</P>
<P>
   She said about 300 to 400 of the contract workers her firm has
placed with Boeing could be affected by the job cuts. Many of those
workers are highly skilled engineers who were hired during Boeing's
worldwide recruiting drive 2{ years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're confident we will be able to place them in other
positions throughout the Puget Sound,'' Cartland said.
</P>
<P>
   Dworkin with CTS agreed, saying there is a strong marketplace
for top-notch engineers.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are highly sought-after technical aerospace engineers
and designers who are experts in their fields,'' he said.

HAYWORTH AND KOLBE LEARN LEADERSHIP STRATEGIES AT PENTAGON
EXPENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF BARKER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Lawmakers have long traded rhetorical fire, and now
they've gone a step further: military training.
</P>
<P>
   A new Pentagon report details how Army centers around the
country improperly picked up the tab to train GOP House members,
including two Arizonans, in war and leadership strategies after
Republicans took over Congress in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona representatives, J.D. Hayworth and Jim Kolbe, and 18
of Kolbe's staff members, traveled to Army bases in 1995 and 1996,
respectively, for sessions on such topics as strategic thinking and
crisis management.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were interested in learning how the Army trains individuals
to be more effective leaders,'' said Ron Foreman, Kolbe's press
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gave the staff some insight into how a war fighter thinks,
how a war fighter seeks to neutralize the `enemy.' Don't forget
that at the time this training took place, we had only recently had
to deal with the Mount Graham protesters coming into the office and
chaining themselves to furniture and being disruptive.''
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrators were protesting a Kolbe-backed telescope
project on Mount Graham.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for the training took root when Newt Gingrich _ a
self-styled ``military brat'' whose stepfather was a career Army
officer _ sent his chief of staff and other aides to the Army
Training and Doctrine Command at Fort Monroe, Va., for a briefing
on organizational design.
</P>
<P>
   Other training sessions followed, but the Pentagon Office of
Inspector General now says the Army made a mistake by picking up
the bill instead of having the lawmakers pay their own way. The
report didn't question the value of the training itself.
</P>
<P>
   Though there is no evidence that Republicans were hatching
strategy to use against Democrats, an Army official expressed
concerns about the seminars in a December 1995 memo.
</P>
<P>
   ``My personal feelings are that we keep a wary eye on this
process; we could wind up being loved too much, and to our
embarrassment,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The $15,000 expenditure for the sessions included training for
Hayworth, Kolbe, 18 members of Kolbe's staff, Gingrich and a small
group of other GOP aides and lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Kolbe and his staff accepted an Army invitation to be sent to
Fort McNair in Virginia in March 1996. The one-day training cost
$1,022, including meals.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon isn't asking for any of the $15,000 back. Foreman
noted that, from a fiscal standpoint, it doesn't matter who pays
because ``we're really talking about taxpayer dollars coming out of
one account to reimburse taxpayer dollars for another account.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate breakdown on how much Hayworth's training
cost. He attended a two-day session at Virginia's Fort Monroe in
November 1995 along with a dozen other members and staff.
</P>
<P>
   An itinerary for Hayworth's trip includes the notation,
```Depart for Fort Monroe via U.S. Army helicopter.'' It says that
the members and staff began training on a Thursday evening, stayed
overnight at a hotel and continued the sessions the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Hayworth ``thought it was all very valuable,'' said Joseph Eule,
his chief of staff. ``This is the kind of training that military
officers get who work in high stress jobs like we have.''
</P>
<P>
   Eule said Hayworth, like the other members who attended, assumed
the Army had checked out the propriety of footing the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has nothing to do with Congressman Hayworth,'' Eule said.
``This was organized by the Army and by the speaker's office
(Gingrich), and if there are outstanding issues regarding billing,
we're confident that the Army and the speaker will work them out.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, Kolbe has taken the White House to task for
using taxpayer dollars to fund political events such as coffees.
</P>
<P>
   ``In that context, if the Army determined these (training
sessions) were reimbursable expenses . . . then we'd certainly
support that,'' Foreman said. ``No one should be left with the
impression that we're trying to get away with something here.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Kolbe nor Hayworth were available for comment, their
aides said.
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general's report emphasized that, despite some
initial concerns, there was no evidence the Army personnel
addressed partisan issues in their briefings. It said instructors
wore their uniforms to emphasize that their training was on Army
procedures.
</P>
<P>
   The seminars covered such things as information management,
strategic thinking and the art of battle decision-making. Gingrich,
R-Ga., has made three personal visits to Fort Monroe in 1993, 1995
and 1997 for briefings on such subjects as lessons learned in
Somalia, war fighting concepts and the Army's future.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich spokesman Andrew Weinstein said the report ``concludes
that this was a minor internal Defense Department billing issue.''
He said it was proper for the military to help lawmakers learn how
to better carry out their official duties. &QL;

`EL DUQUE' BLANKS RANGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Dear Texas Rangers:
</P>
<P>
   Meet the Yankees' /No. 5'' starter.
</P>
<P>
   (Gulp.)
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez, who recorded a
career-high 13 strikeout during 8 1/3 innings, surrendered only two
hits as New York defeated the Rangers, 2-0, last night at Yankee
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   That does not bode well for the Rangers should the two emerge as
opponents in the American League's best-of-five, divisional playoff
series, which would occur if the postseason began this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers retained their half-game advantage in the AL West
with a little help from the second-place Anaheim Angels, who lost
to the Blue Jays, 4-3, last night in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez's masterpiece overshadowed the performance of Rangers
right-hander Rick Helling, who surrendered only three singles and
issued three walks during his third complete-game effort this
season.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees scratched a run during the first inning with a
two-out, run-scoring single from first baseman Tino Martinez and
scored the game's only other run on a third-inning sacrifice fly
off the bat of shortstop Derek Jeter.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the Rangers wasted what manager Johnny Oates described as
Helling's ``best outing'' this season. But perhaps no inning proved
more costly than the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Second baseman Mark McLemore collected the first of the Rangers'
season-low two hits with a one-out double that glanced high off the
center-field wall. Hernandez (8-3) then demonstrated his savvy.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez _ who entered the game allowing left-handed hitters a
.315 batting average _ pitched left fielder Rusty Greer cautiously
and issued a walk.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez _ who entered the game allowing right-handed hitters a
.144 batting average _ went aggressively after right fielder Juan
Gonzalez with a steady diet of sliders off the plate. Hernandez
retired the right-handed batter on strikes for the inning's second
out before loading the bases with a two-out walk to first baseman
Will Clark, another of the Rangers' left-handed hitters.
</P>
<P>
   That brought catcher Ivan Rodriguez to the plate with two outs,
and Hernandez took an approach similar to the one Gonzalez
witnessed. Hernandez retired Rodriguez on strikes as well, and the
Rangers managed only three runners the remainder of the evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fourth inning was a telltale sign of what type of pitcher
he is,'' Oates said of Hernandez. ``It looked like he knew who he
wanted to pitch against. He knew he wanted to go after Juan and
Pudge, and he wasn't going to mess around with Rusty and Will.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, who missed the previous three games with muscle spasms
in the left side of his neck, went 0-for-3 with three strikeouts
and a ninth-inning walk against Hernandez. The Rangers'
right-handed batters went 1-for-14 with two walks and 10 strikeouts
against ``El Duque.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's tough on right-handed hitters,'' said third baseman Todd
Zeile, who collected the Rangers' second and final base hit with a
seventh-inning double. ``He throws strikes with three different
pitches from all different angles. Anybody who can do that is going
to be effective.''
</P>
<P>
   The depth of their rotation best explains why the Yankees will
enter tonight's game 59 games over .500 and on a pace to establish
a major-league record with 121 victories this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great rotation,'' Gonzalez said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, it might not include Hernandez once the playoffs begin.
</P>
<P>
   That likely pleases the Rangers, but what does that say about
the remainder of the Yankees' rotation?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a nice problem to have,'' Yankees manager Joe Torre said.

DAVENPORT REACHES QUARTERFINALS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE STEVENS  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scorching, hot, en fuego... pick a word to describe Lindsay
Davenport.
</P>
<P>
   Ranked second in the world, Davenport has won the last two Corel
WTA tournaments, at Stanford and La Costa, and is looking for her
third straight win in the Acura Classic at Manhattan Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport sizzled again on Thursday night. She advanced to the
quarterfinals with ease when she beat Julie Halard-Decugis 6-0,
6-4, in 49 minutes and win her ninth consecutive match.
</P>
<P>
   After winning the Manhattan Beach tournament in 1996, Davenport
is trying to reclaim Los Angeles bragging rights because Monica
Seles dethroned her in last year's final. Next, in the
quarterfinals, Davenport faces eighth-seeded Natasha Zvereva
tonight at 7. Zvereva, who also lives in Newport Beach, is
Davenport's usual doubles partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it's the battle of Newport Beach,'' Davenport
said. ``It will be important when we go back to our club.''
</P>
<P>
   Winning at Manhattan Beach is important to Davenport, but it
does not compare to winning a Grand Slam event. With the rest of
the tour, she is keying up for the U.S. Open later this month.
</P>
<P>
   There are signs that the rigors of the tour are taking a toll on
the 6-2, 175-pound Davenport. She has opted not to play doubles
this week to grab some rest and will skip a tournament between the
Acura Classic and U.S. Open. She was lucky to not have played since
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really happy to have the Thursday start,'' Davenport
said. ``I was pretty sore all over, and the days off helped. I was
able to relax at home. I saw a few friends, didn't do anything
strenuous.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest paid off in the match against Halard-Decugis, ranked
34th. Davenport took the first set in 16 minutes. In the second
set, Halard-Decugis staged a brief comeback, tying it at 4 after
trailing 4-1. But Davenport took the final two games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes when you're playing really well, a few more errors
start to creep in,'' Davenport said. ``That's what happened then.
She really started to run well and get a lot of balls, and before I
knew it, it was 4-4.''
</P>
<P>
   Davenport, 22, lives in Newport Beach and was born in Palos
Verdes. Her hometown ties add incentive to win in Manhattan Beach,
but that is not her main tennis goal. That goal, winning a Grand
Slam event, cannot be achieved on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always said that the ranking doesn't matter that much,''
Davenport said. ``If I had to choose between being No.1 or winning
a Grand Slam tournament, I'd chose to win the Grand Slam. I'm sure
I'd be happy and excited if I became No.1. But that still is a long
way away.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though she has been inching toward top-ranked Hingis,
Davenport is not quite breathing down her neck. Davenport first
became No.2 on November 17 and was 2,741 points behind Hingis.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport has made huge strides and now stands 497 points behind
Hingis. But that still is a world away. For example, when Davenport
won the Toshiba Classic at La Costa last week and Hingis lost in
the semifinals, she gained just 90 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's 500 points, but that seems like a far way away,''
Davenport said. ``But in the past few months, I think my level has
really risen.''

HERNANDEZ CHALLENGES RANGERS AND WINS, 2-0 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Orlando Hernandez lived his whole life according to
the whims of the state before defecting from Cuba. Now he is in the
United States, wearing New York Yankee pinstripes, living the way
he wants, pitching the way he wants.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez worked against conventional baseball wisdom Thursday
night, as he struck out 13 batters in eight and a third innings and
beat the Texas Rangers, 2-0, before 53,835 fans at Yankee Stadium,
many of them cheering and standing as Hernandez struck out another
hitter.
</P>
<P>
   In beating the Rangers, who lead the American League West,
Hernandez (8-3) allowed two hits before yielding to Mariano Rivera
with one out in the ninth inning. By then he had pitched a
two-hitter and shut down the team ranked second in the league in
batting average and runs scored.
</P>
<P>
   By striking out 13, Hernandez set a single-game record for a
Yankee rookie, surpassing the mark of 12 by Stan Bahnsen against
Boston in 1968. Only David Cone, with 14 against Florida on June 7,
has collected more strikeouts in a Yankee game this season.
</P>
<P>
   The performance prompted a curtain call for Hernandez by the
crowd, which roared in appreciation after he departed in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Just another day at the records office for the Yankees, who are
running away from the rest of the American League East, the rest of
the American League and almost all previous standards of success.
</P>
<P>
   They have won eight straight games, their third winning streak
of eight games or more this season, and have 88 victories and 29
losses. They need to win 29 of their remaining 45 games to set a
major-league record for victories in one season.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez works out according to his own program; Manager Joe
Torre figures that Hernandez's training regimen is so much more
strenuous, with so much more running, that he may as well let the
right-hander do what he wants. Hernandez wears his baseball pants
higher than almost any other player, he bends the bill of his cap
unlike anyone else and he certainly pitches the way he wants.
</P>
<P>
   He struck out five batters in the first three innings without
allowing a hit, establishing early that he had a good fastball and
that right-handed batters would have difficulty tracking his
sidearm slider.
</P>
<P>
   With one out in the fourth and the Yankees ahead by two runs,
Mark McLemore ripped the Rangers' first hit, tomahawking a high
fastball off the top of the wall in right-center field for a
double. Rusty Greer, a left-handed hitter, was coming up, and as
Juan Gonzalez, with a major-league-leading 119 RBIs, loomed in the
on-deck circle, biceps bulging, it figured that Hernandez would
pitch aggressively to Greer.
</P>
<P>
   And of course, Hernandez defied that logic. He worked around
Greer, walking him on four straight pitches, the sort of approach
that makes a manager grind his teeth. Hernandez, no doubt, had seen
Gonzalez swing weakly at sliders in his first at-bat, and he wanted
to test him again.
</P>
<P>
   Three sidearm sliders. Three swings. A strikeout. A roar.
</P>
<P>
   Will Clark stepped up, and Hernandez once again demonstrated his
preference to work around a left-handed batter. He walked Clark to
fill the bases, bringing up Ivan Rodriguez, who entered the game
with a .326 batting average.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez got ahead of Rodriguez with two fastballs, then threw
a slider. The fans stood and screamed for another strikeout, and
got it, when Rodriguez flailed pathetically at another sidearm
slider.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez struck out the side again in the fifth, giving him 10
strikeouts in five innings, then struck out Gonzalez for the third
time in the sixth. When Mike Simms struck out in the seventh,
Hernandez had 12 strikeouts. His previous high had been nine,
against Montreal on June 3 and against the New York Mets on June
28.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Yankees have led at some point in every game since that Mets
game, 42 in all, and as they have done during this homestand, they
jumped out ahead early last night.
</P>
<P>
   With one out in the first, Derek Jeter reached on a throwing
error by the Texas shortstop Royce Clayton, and Paul O'Neill
walked. Jeter seemed to sabotage the rally by getting thrown out
trying to steal third base.
</P>
<P>
   Bernie Williams singled, however, with O'Neill stopping at
second, and Tino Martinez smacked a single to left, O'Neill
scampering home with the Yankees' first run.
</P>
<P>
   In the third inning, Scott Brosius, who has been using a heavier
bat in the last month, led off with a single. Swinging a 34-ounce
bat, Brosius had four homers in the five games preceding last
night's and he had five RBIs on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Batting against Texas starter Rick Helling in the third inning,
Brosius pulled a single through the left side, then took second on
a wild pitch.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees then put their fundamental skills to work. Chuck
Knoblauch pushed a grounder to the right side, giving himself up to
advance Brosius to third, and Jeter lined out to deep right field,
allowing Brosius to tag up and score.
</P>
<P>
   It was 2-0, all the runs Hernandez would need.
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE PITCH:
</P>
<P>
   The Baltimore Orioles may fade out of the playoff race and look
to trade veteran players before the Sept. 1 deadline for playoff
rosters, but the Yankees have destroyed any chance of the Orioles'
swapping either second baseman Roberto Alomar or first baseman
Rafael Palmeiro. According to an American League executive, the
Yankees placed waiver claims on both players, forcing the Orioles
to withdraw both names from the waiver wire. By rule, neither can
be traded for the rest of the season. ... Designated hitter Chili
Davis has four days left in his rehabilitation assignment at Class
AAA Columbus, and assuming he doesn't reinjure his right ankle, the
Yankees intend to activate him on Monday, for a game in Kansas
City. Outfielder Shane Spencer is expected to go back to the
minors.

`YOU BE THE JUDGE': THOUGHT-PROVOKING, IF CHEESY 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1998, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tune in to ``You Be the Judge'' to hear Jerry Orbach say,
``Coming up next, arguments why you should have a gun in your
home.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, good. One reason might be for just such an occasion. To blow
your Sony through the wall and into your next-door neighbor's
kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Unless you believe in speaking reasonably to your Sony and
trying to persuade it to hurl itself through the wall.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, Sunday's special on NBC, hosted by the ``Law and Order''
star, tries to stink up the tube but has merit in spite of itself.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to take three divisive public issues, separately
present strident pro and con arguments for each, and let viewers
figure out where they stand.
</P>
<P>
   These aren't issues like, should we watch ``Home Improvement''
or ``Frasier.'' Sunday's trio: Should police engage in high-speed
pursuits? Have sexual harassment lawsuits gone too far? Should
Americans keep guns in their homes for self-defense?
</P>
<P>
   You (big sound effect) be the judge.
</P>
<P>
   ``You Be the Judge'' does its best to conceal its value under
all the cheesy production values of an ``Unsolved Mysteries.''
</P>
<P>
   That means turbocharged re-enactments and raw emotion. The pro
and con pieces, about seven minutes each, are like extended
political hit commercials.
</P>
<P>
   But ``You Be the Judge,'' with its battling tape clips, does
effectively provoke thought about things that matter.
</P>
<P>
   Here are the best reasons for cops to barrel after a traffic
violator at dangerous speeds, or not. The best reasons to keep a
gun, or not.
</P>
<P>
   The sexual harassment installment is less focused. One clip
makes the case that laws are vague, the other that sexual
harassment exists. When you can agree with both clips, the argument
hasn't been properly framed.
</P>
<P>
   For NBC, the unintentional irony is that a low-rent
entertainment special will probably give viewers more insight and
useful information than the news division's ``Dateline NBC,'' which
follows it on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Stone Phillips, or Jerry Orbach? You (sound of rapping gavel) be
the judge.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL ADD FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   _ Other sluggers have broken his major records, but HBO's ``Babe
Ruth,'' on Sunday, shows how the Bambino remains baseball's
greatest figure, 50 years after his death.
</P>
<P>
   Producer Rick Bernstein's hourlong documentary is repetitive and
hyperbolic. But it does capture Ruth as a force of nature, and a
well-timed metaphor for America's own growing clout and broad
shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   He was jolly and vulgar, and had a huge appetite for everything
from chow to sex. He wasn't the brightest bulb. When he heard that
someone had a case of amnesia, he wondered if a bottle might be
saved for him.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth was also exciting, and generous, and so physically gifted
that he took the national pastime on his back and transformed it
forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a joy to be around,'' says one of Ruth's biographers.
``He lifted things up. He was alive.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Also this weekend: On HBO's ``Hot Cup of Talk'' (Friday),
comic Kathy Griffin of ``Suddenly Susan'' is delicious dissing
Celine Dion and Mariah Carey, but perhaps too crude for most tastes
when she converts her own anatomy into a comedy riff ... ``Titanic
Live'' (Sunday on the Discovery Channel) will be just that _ a live
telecast exploring the liner's wreck site in the North Atlantic ...
And the Fox Family Channel, formerly just the Family Channel,
presents ``Men in White,'' a movie spoof of ``Men in Black,'' on
Sunday. They're a mite slow on the uptake, and didn't send out a
preview tape.

SWISS AMENDS HISTORIC BUT TOO LATE, JEWS SAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID R. BAKER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- To many people whose families vanished into Nazi
death camps more than 50 years ago, the $1.25 billion settlement
between Swiss banks and Holocaust survivors seems a small thing,
they said.
</P>
<P>
   A good thing, to be sure. A belated act of justice, righting an
old wrong. But what use is the money, they asked, when it will be
split among perhaps hundreds of thousands of people so late in
their lives?
</P>
<P>
   And why did the settlement take so long?
</P>
<P>
   ``They should have been open when we came from the camps and
needed every penny,'' said suburban Studio City resident Cesia
Kingston, who endured the Auschwitz concentration camp as a girl.
</P>
<P>
   Kingston was among those who said that they don't care about the
money at this point in their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Her wealthy aunt, who died in the Holocaust, had money in
Switzerland. But Kingston cannot get excited about the possibility
of seeing some of the money when she remembers the loss of her
parents, a brother and a sister.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't bring them back,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement agreement ends a federal class-action suit
against Swiss banks that still hold assets of Jews killed during
World War II. It came only after states and cities nationwide
threatened to sanction the banks unless they cooperated.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly who receives the money is not yet clear. People whose
family belongings were looted by the Nazis, as well as those whose
families actually held Swiss bank accounts, may be eligible for
payments, according to the Simon Wiesenthal Center.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that so many details remain to be worked out disturbs
some Holocaust survivors. Even the youngest children thrown into
the Nazi camps are now old.
</P>
<P>
   ``The survivors aren't youngsters anymore,'' said Samuel
Fischman of suburban Westwood. ``I'm 74, so if they don't give out
the money soon, even more of us will be gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Most L.A. residents involved in the fight with the banks hailed
the settlement as historic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows that justice has a long reach, that after 50 years
those who had absconded with money from victims of the Holocaust
were forced to admit that what they did was immoral,'' said Rabbi
Marvin Hier, dean and founder of the Simon Wiesenthal Center.
</P>
<P>
   Many survivors noted with anger that the banks settled with the
survivors only under intense international pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they want to do business in the world, they have to
straighten this out,'' said Herman Federman of suburban North
Hills, who lost his mother, a brother and a sister to the death
camps. ``Switzerland was supposed to be neutral and honest. But if
it weren't for the U.S., they wouldn't have done anything.''
</P>
<P>
   At least one person said he understands the difficulty the Swiss
faced in reconciling the claims.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Stern of the Jewish Federation in Los Angeles said that
although the Swiss bankers have treated Holocaust survivors poorly,
they also faced genuine problems tracing money deposited by Jews in
the tense years leading up to World War II. Much of the money came
from Jews living in other countries where they risked arrest for
depositing their cash in foreign banks, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in love with a girl in Hungary whose father was caught
doing this,'' Stern said. ``He was put in jail, and he never got
out.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the money often arrived in Switzerland through
middlemen, or may not have arrived at all, Stern said.

STREET SMARTS/MARK VEVERKA  
 RUMORS OF VANSTAR BREAKUP HAVE SILICON VALLEY HEADS SPINNING 
</HEADLINE>
 CHRON - STREET SMARTS   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
A breakup of Vanstar appears to be in the cards.
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the bottom continues to drop out of the Atlanta-based
computer services company, the probability of a corporate
restructuring that would unlock shareholder value is running very
high, say sources familiar with the situation.
</P>
<P>
   The Valley is abuzz with leaks about Vanstar's plans to spin off
its more valuable computer services and consulting business as a
separate company. The $2.8 billion behemoth has a huge presence in
the Bay Area, employing about 1,000 workers at offices and
warehouses in Pleasanton, Concord, Alameda and Livermore. Vanstar's
companywide payroll is just short of 8,000.
</P>
<P>
   Word is that line-managers on up have been taking part in
strategy powwows to prepare for a divestiture, sources say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plans (for a breakup) are in the works,'' says a vendor
source who has been apprised of the changes. ``I think its pretty
imminent.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that one of Vanstar's three business segments,
the selling of personal computers, is punishing the company's stock
valuation. Unit sales for that segment are up, but gross profit
margins are down.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the company's other two businesses _ computer
services and consulting _ each are growing rapidly and enjoy fat
profit margins in the 30 to 40 percent range.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the likely scenario is for Vanstar to spin off its
consulting and services shops as a separate company so that it
might fetch a much higher stock price than the valuation of the
three companies combined.
</P>
<P>
   It can't get much worse. Right now, Vanstar stock is in the
tank. It closed yesterday at $7.56 a share, a 52-week low.
</P>
<P>
   The share price has been slammed because the company warned last
week that financial results for its first quarter ended July 31
would be worse than anticipated. Vanstar says it expects revenues
of about $645 million, some $35 million to $55 million lower than
previous estimates.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the company expects an operating loss of as much as
25 cents a share for the quarter, which is way off the Street's
adjusted consensus estimate of 2 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the warning, though, one financial analyst pegged the
breakup value of Vanstar at $20 a share. But now, Vincent Turzo of
Jefferies in San Francisco is backing off that valuation until the
company officially posts its July quarter numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Above and beyond lousy earnings, a key problem is that investors
consider Vanstar a personal computer distributor, using a
price-earnings multiple of about 13 times earnings. Consulting and
services companies often see multiples as high as 30 times
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, Vanstar officials are sticking to the party
line. They acknowledge that the company has been working closely
with CS First Boston's technology group, led by uberbanker Frank
Quattrone, to ``evaluate the full range of options'' for the
company.
</P>
<P>
   In a previously released statement, Vanstar said its choices
include ``realignment or separation of the company's business
units, the merger or sale of the company, or the disposition of
certain assets.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if the playbook called for option one (a spin-off),
investor relations director Christine Mohrmann would say only that
the company ``does not comment on speculation or rumors.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Vanstar's directors are prepared to vote on a
restructuring is unclear. The full board is next scheduled to meet
at the company's annual shareholder meeting in Atlanta on September
9.
</P>
<P>
   Mohrr would not ``speculate'' on whether a breakup vote would be
on the board's agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, the company's proxy statement for the shareholder
confab is expected to be filed today or Monday with the Securities
and Exchange Commission. And it is not expected to include any
official business for shareholders regarding a restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the pressure is on Vanstar chief executive William
Tauscher and his board to do something to boost shareholder value.
Applying the most heat is Leon Cooperman, manager of the $4.5
billion Omega hedge fund in New York, which has owned as much as
4.9 percent of Vanstar.
</P>
<P>
   Cooperman called for a divestiture during a conference call with
management in late spring. Now, he's just sitting by his phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just waiting to see what the company has to say,''
Cooperman says.
</P>
<P>
   The money manager adds that Vanstar management has told him that
its bankers also are ``shopping the company around to strategic
buyers,'' which means that a buyout is not totally out of the
question.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, it sounds as though management has been listening to
Cooperman's pleas.

CITYSEARCH PULLS IPO, WILL BUY TICKETMASTER  
 BY JON SWARTZ 
</HEADLINE>
 CHRON - CITYSEARCH   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
CitySearch abruptly yanked its initial public offering yesterday
and instead announced a merger with USA Networks' Ticketmaster unit
worth a reported $260 million.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The combined company, to be called Ticketmaster
Online-CitySearch, plans to file an IPO later this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tough decision,'' said Charles Conn, Ticketmaster
Online-CitySearch chief executive. Conn previously was the CEO of
CitySearch. ``Investors were jazzed about the CitySearch offering,
but something better came along. We anticipate a more successful
IPO with the new company.''
</P>
<P>
   CitySearch had every intention of going public, he said, until
USA Networks began 11th-hour merger talks two weeks ago. The
companies inked a deal last year for CitySearch to offer
Ticketmaster access on its community Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of yesterday's merger, USA Networks agreed to
increase its stake in Pasadena-based CitySearch to 62.5 percent
from 13 percent. Conn said the deal would allow the firm to offer
``integrated ticketing'' on its online arts and entertainment guide
of 18 cities, including San Francisco, Los Angeles and Washington,
D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Ticketmaster Online, launched almost two years ago, has
increased monthly sales to $10 million from $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Industry observers said CitySearch officials pulled the
company's IPO out of fear that it would pale in comparison with
another online community, GeoCities, which more than doubled its
initial offering price of $17, to $37.31, on Tuesday. The stock
closed at $38.50 yesterday, placing its market cap at a staggering
$1.18 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Monica-based GeoCities, which generates online traffic by
letting users create free Web sites, pegged its initial price range
at $12 to $14 in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing.
</P>
<P>
   CitySearch, by comparison, had not changed its pricing range of
$11 to $13 since an IPO filing in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough IPO market even for Internet companies,'' said
portfolio manager Kathleen Smith of Renaissance Capital Corp.'s IPO
Fund in Greenwich, Conn. ``It's important to get out there first
and establish your brand name.''
</P>
<P>
   Jittery investors also were concerned whether CitySearch could
knock heads with America Online, Microsoft, Yahoo and others.
</P>
<P>
   CitySearch lost $8.5 million for the quarter ended June 30,
compared with an $8.9 million shortfall a year ago. The company
registered sales of $3.7 million, up from $1 million last year. All
told, the 3-year-old company has lost $60 million.
</P>
<P>
   But Conn insisted that the merger strengthens CitySearch's
offerings and primes it for a bigger IPO.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors are desperate for good stories,'' Conn said. ``The
fact that GeoCities went strongly created a greater buzz for us
among investors.''

RIFLE CHAMP DISQUALIFIED, ACCUSED OF CHEATING ON SCORES  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By WILLIAM HERMANN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMP PERRY, Ohio _ A young Arizona woman, hailed last year as a
national shooting champion, has been accused of cheating at the
nation's most prestigious shooting tournament here.
</P>
<P>
   Danielle Abbott, 18, was disqualified Wednesday from the
National Rifle Association's high-power rifle championships after a
rules committee determined she had falsified a score card.
</P>
<P>
   A California youth also admitted to falsifying a score card.
Both left Camp Perry on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, preliminary results Thursday indicated that Nancy
Tompkins-Gallagher of Prescott won the match's highest overall
award, the national high-power rifle championship. Her daughter,
Michelle Gallagher, 17, won a 600-yard rife match; Jake Quamme, 13,
of Goodyear, won a standing shooting match.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott, whose family lives in Queen Creek, astonished the
shooting world here last year when at age 17 she won the civilian
service rifle championship. But many in the Valley were also
questioning that remarkable victory Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know many shooters are wondering about that win last year,
but as far as I'm concerned right now, it's a dead issue,'' said
match director Jim Hill, himself a past Camp Perry champion.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott could not be reached for comment Thursday. However, her
father, Terry Abbott, 45, said: ``She does not deny anything. She
put herself under tremendous pressure to do well. That pressure
overcame her good judgment.
</P>
<P>
   ``She made a mistake. She regrets that very much.''
</P>
<P>
   The prestigious four-day event at an Ohio National Guard base on
Lake Erie establishes the NRA national champion in various
categories of high-power rifle shooting. Shooters regard the annual
contest as the ultimate challenge; many prepare for it all year.
</P>
<P>
   Hill said that on Tuesday, five competitors who were shooting
``with or near'' Abbott filed a protest with officials when they
saw scores posted with higher values for Abbott than they had
witnessed her shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her scorekeeper also said the signature on the scorecard was
not his, and the scores were not the same as he had recorded,''
Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   Hill said the scoring committee determined that Abbott
apparently substituted another score card for the original one,
``and falsified the scores she received.'' He said he never before
had known of a suspected cheating incident at Camp Perry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we've got two at one time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   High-power rifle competitors shoot from 200, 300 and 600 yards,
with rifles equipped with open sites _ no telescopic sights are
allowed. Competitors shoot from standing, sitting and prone
positions.
</P>
<P>
   While one person is shooting, another competitor keeps score
beside the shooter; a third stands down range behind a protective
berm and raises and lowers the target and marks the spot where the
bullets hit.
</P>
<P>
   It was a scorer working with a competitor near Abbott who first
noted problems with her score. Quinn Moore, 45, of Albertville,
Ala., lost the championship to Abbott last year by one point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did she come here and not think we'd be watching her?'' Moore
asked Thursday. ``I watched her shoot a 196, but when it was posted
it became a 199. After we saw that we really started watching her,
and she did it again.''  &QL;

AIDES SAY CLINTON WEIGHS ADMITTING SEXUAL CONTACTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS for insert; graf beginning ``Under this interpretation ...''
is new.)  (lh) 
 This article was reported by James Bennet, Richard L. Berke, Neil
A. Lewis and David E. Sanger and was written by Berke.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton has had extensive discussions
with his inner circle about a strategy of acknowledging to a grand
jury on Monday that he had intimate sexual encounters with Monica
Lewinsky in the White House, senior advisers have said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton has not settled on this approach, discussions
have centered on a plan that would allow him to acknowledge a
specific type of sexual behavior while still maintaining he told
the truth when he testified in January that he never had ``sexual
relations'' with the former White House intern, the advisers said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton would say he based his previous denial, in a deposition
in the Paula Jones lawsuit, on a definition of sex approved by the
judge in the case. His advisers believe this definition does not
cover certain activities, including oral sex.
</P>
<P>
   For months, Clinton has publicly denied any sexual relationship
with Ms. Lewinsky. So an acknowledgment of some kind of sexual
encounter poses considerable political risk, particularly if it
were linked to a legal argument that rests on a narrow definition
of sex.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton's advisers have said that telling anything less than
the truth to a grand jury about sex with Ms. Lewinsky poses an even
greater risk. It is not clear how precisely Clinton has described
his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky to his lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Once Clinton settles on what to say to the grand jury on Monday,
he must decide whether, and how, to explain his testimony to the
American public.
</P>
<P>
   Several Clinton advisers said there is a consensus that Clinton
should speak out publicly, perhaps in a brief televised speech,
after he testifies. Several advisers said the feeling is that the
president's testimony will somehow be leaked to the public anyway,
so he should portray it from his point of view, which would oblige
him to offer some specifics about the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   The advisers cautioned that preparations for the grand jury
appearance are continuing and strategy could still change as the
president continues to examine the legal and political implications
of various courses.
</P>
<P>
   It could be that some of the president's advisers are discussing
his possible approaches with reporters to gauge the political
reaction. The president has been severely limited in his ability to
take political soundings, because anyone he talks to other than his
private lawyers and his wife is vulnerable to subpoenas from
Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   The most crucial discussions have been confined to a small group
of advisers, all of whom have some recognized privilege that may be
invoked against prosecutors seeking to learn of their advice. They
include Clinton's wife, his lawyers Mickey Kantor, former Secretary
of Commerce, and David E. Kendall, along with other lawyers in
Kendall's firm of Williams &AMP; Connolly.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the president's advisers review his options, some have
prefaced their remarks by saying that it is still possible that
Clinton will say again, as he has publicly, that he never had
sexual relations with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Rahm Emanuel, a senior political adviser to the president,
declined on Thursday to discuss Clinton's legal options. ``We're
not going to speculate on the latest theory of what the president
is going to testify to,'' he said. ``As the president said just the
other day, he will testify completely and truthfully.''
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton prepares to navigate the most politically and legally
perilous moment of his presidency, the argument for a public
explanation of some sort reflects the sense of many politicians
that the country wants to see an end to the Lewinsky saga.
Democrats and Republicans alike have suggested that even a mild and
delicately worded confession from the president might reduce the
threat of impeachment hearings based on a report to Congress from
Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the strategy of acknowledging some sexual activities
with Ms. Lewinsky succeeds in inoculating Clinton from perjury
problems, he may face other legal shoals. Starr's grand jury has
also been investigating whether Clinton may have obstructed justice
if he discussed with Ms. Lewinsky ways that she could conceal a
relationship with the president and avoid having to produce gifts
that he gave her when she testified in the Jones lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   After Clinton testifies on Monday, what else he should say is a
subject of considerable debate. Some aides have argued that Clinton
could blunt the political repercussions by offering the public at
least a brief explanation of his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.
Other Clinton advisers, including some outside the White House,
have argued that he should say as little as possible about his
testimony _ that he should not do much more than smile and announce
that he is leaving on vacation.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   An option that is increasingly being considered would be for the
president to testify that he was telling the truth last January
when he followed a precise definition of sexual relations that the
presiding judge had approved in the Jones sexual misconduct
lawsuit. Under that definition, some advisers believe, Clinton
could plausibly assert that his contacts with Ms. Lewinsky did not
constitute sexual relations.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of how to deal with Clinton's testimony in the Jones
case in January is such a critical matter that Kendall reviewed a
videotape of the testimony on Monday. He had already seen a
transcript.
</P>
<P>
   In that deposition, when the president was asked whether he had
an affair with Ms. Lewinsky, his response seemed to be
straightforward: ``I have never had sexual relations with Monica
Lewinsky. I've never had an affair with her.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton was responding to a definition of ``sexual
relations'' that was prepared by Ms. Jones' lawyers and then
narrowed by U.S. District Judge Susan Webber Wright.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, Ms. Jones' lawyers asked Judge Wright to allow
them to use a three-part definition of sexual relations when it
came up in the case:
</P>
<P>
   ``For the purposes of this deposition, a person engages in
`sexual relations' when the person knowingly engages in or causes _
</P>
<P>
   (I) contact with the genitalia, anus, groin, breast, inner
thigh, or buttocks of any person with an intent to arouse or
gratify the sexual desire of any person;
</P>
<P>
   (II) contact between any part of the person's body or an object
and the genitals or anus of another person; or
</P>
<P>
   (III) contact between the genitals or anus of the person and any
part of another person's body. `Contact' means intentional
touching, either directly or through clothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's lawyer, Robert Bennett, objected, arguing that the
definition was too broad and could include such benign activities
as handshaking. Judge Wright agreed and limited the definition to
Part I, excluding the other two.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was apparently attuned to the nuances of the definition
of sexual relations that remained after Judge Wright's ruling. When
he responded to a question of whether he had ever had relations
with Gennifer Flowers, an Arkansas singer and television
personality, he replied, ``The answer to your question if the
definition is Section I, there in the first piece of paper you gave
me, is yes.'' He had never before publicly admitted to any sexual
relationship with Ms. Flowers.
</P>
<P>
   When the subject was Ms. Lewinsky, Clinton, consulting the same
definition, denied a sexual affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no perjury here,'' one adviser to Clinton said,
calling the definition of sexual activity the president was working
from as ``cockamamie.'' Still, the president's advisers believe the
definition used in the Jones case may not cover oral sex.
</P>
<P>
   Under this interpretation, the definition of sexual relations
appears to be limited to whether he had contact with certain parts
of her body, but not others.
</P>
<P>
   The discussions of this strategy have been extensive enough to
include consideration of its major political drawback: it would
reinforce his critics' notion of Clinton as a lawyerly manipulator
of language used to evade responsibility, as someone who may be
technically truthful but not fundamentally honest. The president's
advisers said they fear that this strategy will invite charges that
he is ducking and weaving, exploiting a definitional loophole to
muddy the truth.
</P>
<P>
   They fear it would remind people of Clinton's careful weighing
of his words in 1992 when he and Mrs. Clinton appeared on the CBS
News program, ``60 Minutes'' after Ms. Flowers said that she had
been sexually involved with him.
</P>
<P>
   Before the television appearance, a campaign aide said, the
Clinton campaign conducted focus groups with voters and learned
that older women would react negatively to any discussion of
cheating or adultery. As a result, the aide said, Clinton chose a
more ambiguous phrase to use during the program _ that he had
caused pain in his marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's a legal risk here,'' said one lawyer.
``The risk is really sort of political and public relations.''
</P>
<P>
   Since polls show that many Americans already believe that
Clinton and Ms. Lewinsky had an affair, some White House advisers
hope that changing the essence of the president's story would not
be as damaging as it would have been months ago.
</P>
<P>
   But the advisers said neither they nor the president have
settled on the format in which he should make his case _ or on how
far he should go in discussing his involvement with Ms. Lewinsky.
Part of the uncertainty stems from the fact that many of the
advisers who are debating political strategy are not privy to the
legal discussions and have no idea what Clinton will tell the grand
jury.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's political advisers have not directly asked him about
the nature of his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, although they do
discuss the politics surrounding it. And while they stand by his
denials in public, some have privately concluded that Clinton had
some sort of sexual affair with her. They express confidence that
he found a linguistic loophole to avoid perjuring himself.
</P>
<P>
   If the president argues that he was using a narrow definition of
sex in denying an affair with Ms. Lewinsky, he will undercut
several of his senior aides, who assured the public in January that
he was not splitting hairs. Some White House officials told
reporters in January that they had been specifically told by the
White House Counsel's office that Clinton was not playing word
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sex is sex,'' Ann Lewis, the White House communications
director, said on Jan. 25 on the program ``Fox News Sunday.''
``Maybe only in Washington is this considered something we ought to
spend a lot of time on. But, no, a sexual relationship means what
it says, and that includes sex.''
</P>
<P>
   In the seven months since the Lewinsky matter became public,
Clinton has flatly denied that he had an affair with the former
intern in the White House _ an assertion that he could, of course,
still repeat to the grand jury. But Ms. Lewinsky testified to the
grand jury last week that she and the president had sex on several
occasions, according to people familiar with her account. And she
turned over to Starr a dress that is being tested to determine
whether there is semen on it.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Clinton is working with his legal advisers on answers to
potential questions from Starr and his colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   The president could stick to his statement that he had no sexual
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky whatsoever _ though that would
directly contradict Ms. Lewinsky's testimony. If the grand jury
believed her, that would open the question of perjury on a much
more serious level _ in a criminal rather than a civil case.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton could also resist questions about the nature of his
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, claiming that they violate his
right to privacy, or he could try to use vague language in response
to specific questions. Yet it is unclear that the courts would
sustain a Fourth Amendment claim to some kind of privacy privilege.
Moreover, there is a risk that he would appear non-responsive if
Starr's team asks him very specific questions about the nature of
his involvement with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   In Clinton's practice sessions, his advisers said, his lawyers
are questioning him and designing answers that allow him to
acknowledge a relationship with Ms. Lewinsky without going into
graphic detail.

AIDES SAY CLINTON WEIGHS ADMITTING SEXUAL CONTACTS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton has had extensive discussions
with his inner circle about a strategy of acknowledging to a grand
jury on Monday that he had intimate sexual encounters with Monica
Lewinsky in the White House, senior advisers have said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton has not settled on this approach, discussions
have centered on a plan that would allow him to acknowledge a
specific type of sexual behavior while still maintaining he told
the truth when he testified in January that he never had ``sexual
relations'' with the former White House intern, the advisers said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton would say he based his previous denial, in a deposition
in the Paula Jones lawsuit, on a definition of sex approved by the
judge in the case. His advisers believe this definition does not
cover certain activities, including oral sex.
</P>
<P>
   For months, Clinton has publicly denied any sexual relationship
with Ms. Lewinsky. So an acknowledgment of some kind of sexual
encounter poses considerable political risk, particularly if it
were linked to a legal argument that rests on a narrow definition
of sex.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton's advisers have said that telling anything less than
the truth to a grand jury about sex with Ms. Lewinsky poses an even
greater risk. It is not clear how precisely Clinton has described
his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky to his lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Once Clinton settles on what to say to the grand jury on Monday,
he must decide whether, and how, to explain his testimony to the
American public.
</P>
<P>
   Several Clinton advisers said there is a consensus that Clinton
should speak out publicly, perhaps in a brief televised speech,
after he testifies. Several advisers said the feeling is that the
president's testimony will somehow be leaked to the public anyway,
so he should portray it from his point of view, which would oblige
him to offer some specifics about the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   The advisers cautioned that preparations for the grand jury
appearance are continuing and strategy could still change as the
president continues to examine the legal and political implications
of various courses.
</P>
<P>
   It could be that some of the president's advisers are discussing
his possible approaches with reporters to gauge the political
reaction. The president has been severely limited in his ability to
take political soundings, because anyone he talks to other than his
private lawyers and his wife is vulnerable to subpoenas from
Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   The most crucial discussions have been confined to a small group
of advisers, all of whom have some recognized privilege that may be
invoked against prosecutors seeking to learn of their advice. They
include Clinton's wife, his lawyers Mickey Kantor, former Secretary
of Commerce, and David E. Kendall, along with other lawyers in
Kendall's firm of Williams &AMP; Connolly.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the president's advisers review his options, some have
prefaced their remarks by saying that it is still possible that
Clinton will say again, as he has publicly, that he never had
sexual relations with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Rahm Emanuel, a senior political adviser to the president,
declined on Thursday to discuss Clinton's legal options. ``We're
not going to speculate on the latest theory of what the president
is going to testify to,'' he said. ``As the president said just the
other day, he will testify completely and truthfully.''
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton prepares to navigate the most politically and legally
perilous moment of his presidency, the argument for a public
explanation of some sort reflects the sense of many politicians
that the country wants to see an end to the Lewinsky saga.
Democrats and Republicans alike have suggested that even a mild and
delicately worded confession from the president might reduce the
threat of impeachment hearings based on a report to Congress from
Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the strategy of acknowledging some sexual activities
with Ms. Lewinsky succeeds in inoculating Clinton from perjury
problems, he may face other legal shoals. Starr's grand jury has
also been investigating whether Clinton may have obstructed justice
if he discussed with Ms. Lewinsky ways that she could conceal a
relationship with the president and avoid having to produce gifts
that he gave her when she testified in the Jones lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   After Clinton testifies on Monday, what else he should say is a
subject of considerable debate. Some aides have argued that Clinton
could blunt the political repercussions by offering the public at
least a brief explanation of his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.
Other Clinton advisers, including some outside the White House,
have argued that he should say as little as possible about his
testimony _ that he should not do much more than smile and announce
that he is leaving on vacation.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   An option that is increasingly being considered would be for the
president to testify that he was telling the truth last January
when he followed a precise definition of sexual relations that the
presiding judge had approved in the Jones sexual misconduct
lawsuit. Under that definition, some advisers believe, Clinton
could plausibly assert that his contacts with Ms. Lewinsky did not
constitute sexual relations.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of how to deal with Clinton's testimony in the Jones
case in January is such a critical matter that Kendall reviewed a
videotape of the testimony on Monday. He had already seen a
transcript.
</P>
<P>
   In that deposition, when the president was asked whether he had
an affair with Ms. Lewinsky, his response seemed to be
straightforward: ``I have never had sexual relations with Monica
Lewinsky. I've never had an affair with her.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton was responding to a definition of ``sexual
relations'' that was prepared by Ms. Jones' lawyers and then
narrowed by U.S. District Judge Susan Webber Wright.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, Ms. Jones' lawyers asked Judge Wright to allow
them to use a three-part definition of sexual relations when it
came up in the case:
</P>
<P>
   ``For the purposes of this deposition, a person engages in
`sexual relations' when the person knowingly engages in or causes _
</P>
<P>
   (I) contact with the genitalia, anus, groin, breast, inner
thigh, or buttocks of any person with an intent to arouse or
gratify the sexual desire of any person;
</P>
<P>
   (II) contact between any part of the person's body or an object
and the genitals or anus of another person; or
</P>
<P>
   (III) contact between the genitals or anus of the person and any
part of another person's body. `Contact' means intentional
touching, either directly or through clothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's lawyer, Robert Bennett, objected, arguing that the
definition was too broad and could include such benign activities
as handshaking. Judge Wright agreed and limited the definition to
Part I, excluding the other two.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was apparently attuned to the nuances of the definition
of sexual relations that remained after Judge Wright's ruling. When
he responded to a question of whether he had ever had relations
with Gennifer Flowers, an Arkansas singer and television
personality, he replied, ``The answer to your question if the
definition is Section I, there in the first piece of paper you gave
me, is yes.'' He had never before publicly admitted to any sexual
relationship with Ms. Flowers.
</P>
<P>
   When the subject was Ms. Lewinsky, Clinton, consulting the same
definition, denied a sexual affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no perjury here,'' one adviser to Clinton said,
calling the definition of sexual activity the president was working
from as ``cockamamie.'' Still, the president's advisers believe the
definition used in the Jones case may not cover oral sex.
</P>
<P>
   Under this interpretation, the definition of sexual relations
appears to be limited to whether he had contact with certain parts
of her body, but not others.
</P>
<P>
   The discussions of this strategy have been extensive enough to
include consideration of its major political drawback: it would
reinforce his critics' notion of Clinton as a lawyerly manipulator
of language used to evade responsibility, as someone who may be
technically truthful but not fundamentally honest. The president's
advisers said they fear that this strategy will invite charges that
he is ducking and weaving, exploiting a definitional loophole to
muddy the truth.
</P>
<P>
   They fear it would remind people of Clinton's careful weighing
of his words in 1992 when he and Mrs. Clinton appeared on the CBS
News program, ``60 Minutes'' after Ms. Flowers said that she had
been sexually involved with him.
</P>
<P>
   Before the television appearance, a campaign aide said, the
Clinton campaign conducted focus groups with voters and learned
that older women would react negatively to any discussion of
cheating or adultery. As a result, the aide said, Clinton chose a
more ambiguous phrase to use during the program _ that he had
caused pain in his marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's a legal risk here,'' said one lawyer.
``The risk is really sort of political and public relations.''
</P>
<P>
   Since polls show that many Americans already believe that
Clinton and Ms. Lewinsky had an affair, some White House advisers
hope that changing the essence of the president's story would not
be as damaging as it would have been months ago.
</P>
<P>
   But the advisers said neither they nor the president have
settled on the format in which he should make his case _ or on how
far he should go in discussing his involvement with Ms. Lewinsky.
Part of the uncertainty stems from the fact that many of the
advisers who are debating political strategy are not privy to the
legal discussions and have no idea what Clinton will tell the grand
jury.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's political advisers have not directly asked him about
the nature of his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, although they do
discuss the politics surrounding it. And while they stand by his
denials in public, some have privately concluded that Clinton had
some sort of sexual affair with her. They express confidence that
he found a linguistic loophole to avoid perjuring himself.
</P>
<P>

he was not splitting hairs. Some White House officials told
reporters in January that they had been specifically told by the

``Maybe only in Washington is this considered something we ought to

<P>
   Who did it?
</P>
<P>
   The usual Islamist suspects are being laid out for inspection.
Since some of these ``suspects'' are truly suspect, they could well
include the criminal mind or minds behind the twin car bomb
explosions at the American embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam
which on Aug. 7 killed more than 200 people, including 12
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   But for the moment _ which could turn out to be quite a long
moment, as the United States embarks on arduous investigations _
their identity, arrests in Tanzania and sightings in Kenya
notwithstanding, is speculation only.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the message the terrorists delivered, unsigned and amorphous
though it was, is unmistakable: they set out to hurt America and
Americans, although the result was mainly to kill Africans.
</P>
<P>
   This strengthens the general supposition that the guilty
individuals have some Islamist or Middle Eastern connection _ with
the rider that nobody should forget the false leap to Islamist
judgment after the Oklahoma bombing in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   East Africa is unaccustomed to this particular form of violence.
Although there are sub-Saharan Africans who hold strong grudges
against America (Somalis, for instance, in whose country America
carried out a clumsy intervention, or Rwandans, whose rescue it
stood back from), it seems improbable that such people would be
prepared or equipped to exact so coordinated a revenge.
</P>
<P>
   Sudan, where America has been trying, through Sudan's African
neighbors, to undermine the Islamist regime, links Africa to the
Middle East. In a Middle Eastern context, this kind of terrorism is
slightly less baffling _ and certainly less uncommon.
</P>
<P>
   America is by no means the only victim of international terror,
but it is a particularly attractive target for a new sort of
anti-West, anti-everything terrorist group, which typically lacks a
clear agenda but harbors a deep grudge.
</P>
<P>
   It is also, however, a butt for grudge-bearers with an agenda,
especially in the Middle East. And it is here that it has from time
to time _ in the past in Lebanon, recently in Saudi Arabia _ been
an outstanding target for terrorist attack.
</P>
<P>
   Why should Middle Easterners be suspected of bearing hostility
to the United States so bitter that it encompasses mass,
indiscriminate murder?
</P>
<P>
   America, after all, has done much for the region. It led a
coalition of forces to drive Iraq out of the Arab country it had
occupied, it keeps some 35,000 servicemen in and around the Gulf to
protect weak, wealthy states from predatory neighbors, it has
toiled assiduously to further peace between Israel and the Arabs,
it offers a way of life that most find enviable.
</P>
<P>
   Good things, all of them, to have done or to have. Yet all can
be, and frequently are, turned against the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The mirror image of the credits look like debits to many Arabs.
America, these critics argue, has ruthlessly pursued a personal
vendetta against Iraq's Saddam Hussein, the presence of its troops
on Arab land has become an offense to their hosts, it has been
jelly-soft with Israel, its liberal culture corrupts devout
Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   Familiar accusations, often trotted out, and surely no murdering
matter. There is more to it.
</P>
<P>
   America's vulnerability is an adjunct of its peculiar strength.
As sole surviving superpower, without benefit of false modesty, it
stands out distinctly from the crowd, a potential target for
snipers.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes America discreetly masks its preeminence in collective
action. Sometimes it chooses to push ahead on its own, not hanging
around to gather a consensus from fellow members of the U.N.
Security Council or from the European Union. It boldly takes the
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Its trouble, particularly on Middle Eastern issues, is that it
often remains alone.
</P>
<P>
   Disagreements between America and its allies on Middle Eastern
issues tend to be crudely interpreted in the region. The result, in
Arab and Iranian ledgers, is that the United States is entered on
the ``wrong'' side, most of the rest of the world on the ``right.''
</P>
<P>
   On Iran, for instance, America has pursued a much harsher line
than other westerners (and remains the Great Satan to hard-line
Iranians who, involved in political civil war with their own
government, are at least as determined as some Americans that the
inter-state hostility should persist).
</P>
<P>
   On Iraq, America, with virtually only Britain in full support,
has refused to countenance the idea that the time is coming to
remove sanctions which are torturing a people but have so far left
the ruling regime untouched.
</P>
<P>
   In Egypt, America has exerted itself to help the authorities
catch Islamist militants, apparently aiding in the extradition of
fugitives.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, America's diffidence towards the Israeli government
contrasts with almost everybody else's impatience at Israeli
obduracy _ and with its own rigor towards the states it regards as
``pariahs'': Iran, Iraq, Syria and Libya.
</P>
<P>
   Being out of step on Middle Eastern issues is not the same as
being wrong: it can be vigorously argued, and often is, that
America's line is the right one and that others, sometimes guided
by a narrower self-interest, are at fault for not following
America's lead.
</P>
<P>
   True, that lead may well lead nowhere but this, its advocates
would say, does not necessarily invalidate the argument: if America
had had more support, its policies would have had a better chance
of working, and America itself would have been less exposed.
</P>
<P>
   Terrorism, if you cannot do anything about it, is a powerful
disincentive. America's temptation to withdraw into an isolationist
shell could be compelling.
</P>
<P>
   For a start, it would please a great many Americans who see
little point in enduring the grief that comes with a busy foreign
policy. So far this retreat has not taken place, despite the
shrinking of official appetite for foreign activism since the
Somalia mess in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the truck bomb that killed 19 American servicemen
in Dhahran in 1996 was an anonymous bloodstained order to the
Americans to take their 5,000 or so troops out of Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton did not do so _ though the troops were
tactfully withdrawn to an air base deep in the desert, where their
presence, particularly that of women soldiers, is less alarming to
Islamist sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   Of course all governments have the right to make up their own
minds; they certainly should not be sheep to America's shepherd.
Collective action, nearly always preferable to the unilateral
version, should entail America deferring to its allies as well as
the allies deferring to America.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, with all that said, the world can still be mightily
relieved that its richest and most powerful nation is prepared,
despite adverse consequences to itself, to take a lead.
</P>
<P>
   Muddling a way through the maze that still persists long after
the end of the Cold War, dithery countries need someone or
something out front. The greatest disaster would be for terrorist
bombs to create an isolationist or cowering America. &QL;

   America, after all, has done much for the region. It led a
coalition of forces to drive Iraq out of the Arab country it had
occupied, it keeps some 35,000 servicemen in and around the Gulf to
protect weak, wealthy states from predatory neighbors, it has
toiled assiduously to further peace between Israel and the Arabs,
it offers a way of life that most find enviable.
</P>
<P>
   Good things, all of them, to have done or to have. Yet all can
be, and frequently are, turned against the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The mirror image of the credits look like debits to many Arabs.
America, these critics argue, has ruthlessly pursued a personal
vendetta against Iraq's Saddam Hussein, the presence of its troops
on Arab land has become an offense to their hosts, it has been
jelly-soft with Israel, its liberal culture corrupts devout
Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   Familiar accusations, often trotted out, and surely no murdering
matter. There is more to it.
</P>
<P>
   America's vulnerability is an adjunct of its peculiar strength.
As sole surviving superpower, without benefit of false modesty, it
stands out distinctly from the crowd, a potential target for
snipers.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes America discreetly masks its preeminence in collective
action. Sometimes it chooses to push ahead on its own, not hanging
around to gather a consensus from fellow members of the U.N.
Security Council or from the European Union. It boldly takes the
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Its trouble, particularly on Middle Eastern issues, is that it
often remains alone.
</P>
<P>
   Disagreements between America and its allies on Middle Eastern
issues tend to be crudely interpreted in the region. The result, in
Arab and Iranian ledgers, is that the United States is entered on
the ``wrong'' side, most of the rest of the world on the ``right.''
</P>
<P>
   On Iran, for instance, America has pursued a much harsher line
than other westerners (and remains the Great Satan to hard-line
Iranians who, involved in political civil war with their own
government, are at least as determined as some Americans that the
inter-state hostility should persist).
</P>
<P>
   On Iraq, America, with virtually only Britain in full support,
has refused to countenance the idea that the time is coming to
remove sanctions which are torturing a people but have so far left
the ruling regime untouched.
</P>
<P>
   In Egypt, America has exerted itself to help the authorities
catch Islamist militants, apparently aiding in the extradition of
fugitives.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, America's diffidence towards the Israeli government
contrasts with almost everybody else's impatience at Israeli
obduracy _ and with its own rigor towards the states it regards as
``pariahs'': Iran, Iraq, Syria and Libya.
</P>
<P>
   Being out of step on Middle Eastern issues is not the same as
being wrong: it can be vigorously argued, and often is, that
America's line is the right one and that others, sometimes guided
by a narrower self-interest, are at fault for not following
America's lead.
</P>
<P>
   True, that lead may well lead nowhere but this, its advocates
would say, does not necessarily invalidate the argument: if America
had had more support, its policies would have had a better chance
of working, and America itself would have been less exposed.
</P>
<P>
   Terrorism, if you cannot do anything about it, is a powerful
disincentive. America's temptation to withdraw into an isolationist
shell could be compelling.
</P>
<P>
   For a start, it would please a great many Americans who see
little point in enduring the grief that comes with a busy foreign
policy. So far this retreat has not taken place, despite the
shrinking of official appetite for foreign activism since the
Somalia mess in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the truck bomb that killed 19 American servicemen
in Dhahran in 1996 was an anonymous bloodstained order to the
Americans to take their 5,000 or so troops out of Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton did not do so _ though the troops were
tactfully withdrawn to an air base deep in the desert, where their
presence, particularly that of women soldiers, is less alarming to
Islamist sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   Of course all governments have the right to make up their own
minds; they certainly should not be sheep to America's shepherd.
Collective action, nearly always preferable to the unilateral
version, should entail America deferring to its allies as well as
the allies deferring to America.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, with all that said, the world can still be mightily
relieved that its richest and most powerful nation is prepared,
despite adverse consequences to itself, to take a lead.
</P>
<P>
   Muddling a way through the maze that still persists long after
the end of the Cold War, dithery countries need someone or
something out front. The greatest disaster would be for terrorist
bombs to create an isolationist or cowering America. &QL;

<P>
   Who did it?
</P>
<P>
   The usual Islamist suspects are being laid out for inspection.
Since some of these ``suspects'' are truly suspect, they could well
include the criminal mind or minds behind the twin car bomb
explosions at the American embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam
which on Aug. 7 killed more than 200 people, including 12
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   But for the moment _ which could turn out to be quite a long
moment, as the United States embarks on arduous investigations _
their identity, arrests in Tanzania and sightings in Kenya
notwithstanding, is speculation only.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the message the terrorists delivered, unsigned and amorphous
though it was, is unmistakable: they set out to hurt America and
Americans, although the result was mainly to kill Africans.
</P>
<P>
   This strengthens the general supposition that the guilty
individuals have some Islamist or Middle Eastern connection _ with
the rider that nobody should forget the false leap to Islamist
judgment after the Oklahoma bombing in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   East Africa is unaccustomed to this particular form of violence.
Although there are sub-Saharan Africans who hold strong grudges
against America (Somalis, for instance, in whose country America
carried out a clumsy intervention, or Rwandans, whose rescue it
stood back from), it seems improbable that such people would be
prepared or equipped to exact so coordinated a revenge.
</P>
<P>
   Sudan, where America has been trying, through Sudan's African
neighbors, to undermine the Islamist regime, links Africa to the
Middle East. In a Middle Eastern context, this kind of terrorism is
slightly less baffling _ and certainly less uncommon.
</P>
<P>
   America is by no means the only victim of international terror,
but it is a particularly attractive target for a new sort of
anti-West, anti-everything terrorist group, which typically lacks a
clear agenda but harbors a deep grudge.
</P>
<P>
   It is also, however, a butt for grudge-bearers with an agenda,
especially in the Middle East. And it is here that it has from time
to time _ in the past in Lebanon, recently in Saudi Arabia _ been
an outstanding target for terrorist attack.
</P>
<P>
   Why should Middle Easterners be suspected of bearing hostility
to the United States so bitter that it encompasses mass,
indiscriminate murder?
</P>
<P>
   America, after all, has done much for the region. It led a
coalition of forces to drive Iraq out of the Arab country it had
occupied, it keeps some 35,000 servicemen in and around the Gulf to
protect weak, wealthy states from predatory neighbors, it has

KATZ DROPS VOTE CHALLENGE BUT WILL SUE OVER RACE-BAITING MAILER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICK ORLOV  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Ten weeks after the June 2 primary, former
Assemblyman Richard Katz called an end to his legal battle against
Councilman Richard Alarcon, withdrawing a lawsuit challenging
Alarcon's 32-vote victory and conceding the Democratic nomination
in state Senate District 20.
</P>
<P>
   However, Katz announced he is filing a defamation-of-character
lawsuit against state Sen. Richard Polanco, D-Los Angeles, and
Alarcon consultant Richard Ross for a mailer sent out in the final
days of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The despicable campaign tactics that decided this race cannot
go unchallenged,'' Katz said Thursday at a news conference in the
offices of his attorney, Tony Glassman. ``As our electoral process
degrades, too many people are just willing to move on, so the
political campaign tactics get worse. I've decided enough is
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Alarcon, who announced Thursday that he is dropping a
countersuit against Katz as part of a negotiated agreement, said he
was glad that Katz dropped his suit and conceded the election.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the time to have conceded was back in June,''
Alarcon said, ``but this hasn't stopped me from campaigning since
then.''
</P>
<P>
   Katz, who said the loss could spell the end of his political
career, has been particularly upset over a last-minute mailer
developed by Ross and paid for by Polanco implying he was involved
in a 1988 incident in neighboring Orange County where poll guards
attempted to intimidate Latino voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is just so far from the truth,'' Katz said. ``I was the
one who discovered this and won $400,000 in compensation. They knew
it was not the truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lies that Polanco and Ross used to motivate voters were so
far over the line that they should not be allowed to get away with
it. I know that politics is a rough-and-tumble, full-contact
endeavor. I also strongly believe in the sanctity of the First
Amendment. But with the First Amendment comes responsibility,
responsibility that was sorely lacking in the Polanco-Ross
attack.''
</P>
<P>
   The suit seeks unspecified damages.
</P>
<P>
   Glassman acknowledged the case could prove difficult because
Katz is a public figure. However, he said he believes a case could
be made based on Polanco and Ross knowing the information was
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Polanco spokesman Bill Mabie said the senator rejects Katz's
assertions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is no way did the senator defame Richard
Katz,'' Mabie said. ``Katz has tried to blame everybody for his
loss. Now is the time to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Ross said he didn't believe the mailing was defamatory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everything we did was factually correct and within the
realm of protected speech,'' Ross said. ``He thinks it infers
something, but it doesn't say it. He's a public figure.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Katz) has gone through a lot, and it's hard to lose an
election. It hurts more in an election like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Katz's lawsuit against Alarcon had asked that the election
results be overturned because of voting irregularities and the
mailer. In addition, he had paid for a recount of some 40,000 of
the 90,000 ballots cast in the election. The recount results showed
a widening of Alarcon's lead until Katz called it off.
</P>
<P>
   Alarcon said he was somewhat surprised by the defamation lawsuit
filed against Polanco and Ross.
</P>
<P>
   ``The election is over,'' he said. ``We should be moving on. I
find this somewhat ironic in that Richie Ross has worked for Katz
in the past. For 16 years, Katz played in state Democratic
politics, and sometimes things aren't as nice as we would like them
to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with the bitterness that developed between the two since
the election, Katz indicated he would be open to endorsing Alarcon
in the general election against Republican Ollie McCaulley and
Libertarian Linda Starr.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not ruling it out,'' he said. ``It's open to discussion.''
</P>
<P>
   Katz said he has not decided what he will do next, other than
continue in his $94,000-a-year post on the California Medical
Assistance Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not thinking of politics,'' he said. ``I am definitely
not a candidate for the City Council if Alarcon does win.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides, after this election, I'm not sure I could win with
all the damage that this mailing did to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Katz served in the state Assembly for 16 years, representing his
district in the northern part of L.A.'s San Fernando Valley, and
rose to the point of Democratic leader during his last term.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, he was given the credit for taking back the lower house
from Republican control with an aggressive campaign across the
state for Democratic candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Forced from office by term limits in late 1996, Katz waited for
the chance to run for the state Senate seat that is being vacated
this year by Sen. Herschel Rosenthal, also because of term limits.
</P>
<P>
   The only other political loss Katz suffered was in 1993, when he
came in fourth in a bid for Los Angeles mayor.
</P>
<P>
   McCaulley, the GOP candidate, said he was surprised that Katz
would concede the election.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like he was intent on fighting this all the way
through because he felt it was his one chance at the Senate,'' he
said. ``What this does mean is we now have a clear indication of
who we will be running against, and I'm hopeful we can have some
debates.''
</P>
<P>
   McCaulley also said he is concerned that Alarcon will try to use
racial or ethnic factors in the campaign against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure he will try to tie me, as a Republican, to all the
anti-Latino Republicans,'' he said.

<P>
   Many a patriotic Englishman would no doubt this week be tempted
to urge the queen to dub Sir Darren Gough or ennoble Lord Fraser of
Stout Bowling, to mark the astonishing fact that England has at
last won a top international cricket series.
</P>
<P>
   Such titles would at least have the merit of clarity: everyone
would know, at least while the memory lasted, why they had been
granted and what they signified. That is more than can be said for
most _ perhaps all _ of Britain's plethora of faux-aristocratic
titles.
</P>
<P>
   Who can say what Sir Reggie Bloggins actually did to get his
gong, or whether Lady Rhubarb is so-called on her own merit or that
of her husband's checkbook, or what the difference is between a
Viscount Bogtrotter and a Marquess of Bidet?
</P>
<P>
   There is a case for all this. Partly, it is a quaint British
reminder of its feudal history, partly, perhaps, a fairly cheap
system of incentives and rewards for political and public service
that may help restrain the nastier forms of corruption.
</P>
<P>
   It also provides pleasure to recipients and their relatives,
ample cause for gossip for others, and a source of pride to the
three people alive who know what all the titles mean.
</P>
<P>
   Yet that is where the problem lies. Apart from an admirable
fondness for history and tradition, other qualities commonly
associated with Britons include understatement and an instinct for
clarity rather than obfuscation.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, although attempts have been made to retire some
knightly orders and to hand out awards for merit rather than
timeserving, the mishmash of British titles suggests a rather
vulgar boastfulness while being almost wholly bewildering.
</P>
<P>
   Into this bewilderment has strode a voice of more-or-less
clarity, an ennobled one, no less.
</P>
<P>
   Baroness Jay, a life peer who has just been made leader of the
House of Lords, floated in an interview with the Daily Telegraph
the idea that once hereditary peers have been stripped of their
voting rights in the upper house, as Labour plans, the remaining
voting (i.e., life) peers should lose their titles and simply
attach ML, meaning member of the Lords, to their names.
</P>
<P>
   This idea is welcome, as far as it goes. Admittedly, it would
leave the top titles as exclusively a feudal relic rather than
sometimes a badge of actual distinction.
</P>
<P>
   But as the point of a title should be to convey some information
to others, saving them from embarrassment or hours of research,
this would be something of an improvement.
</P>
<P>
   On meeting Lord This or Baron That you would at least know they
were not a political has-been or a businessman being lured into
government, but rather that at some point in a past century they
had a notable ancestor, that it is best not to ask after their sons
or daughters because you will surely get those titles wrong, and
that they can probably afford to pay for dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it leaves many questions unanswered. How can you be a member
of the House of Lords if you are not a lord and if all the real
ones are excluded? This de-nobled house will need a new, suitably
clear, name.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are all those sirs, ladies and dames. The
quickest way to restore British modesty and clarity would be to
abolish the lot.
</P>
<P>
   But if British incrementalism wins out, a compromise could be to
scrap the titles but restrict the users to the sets of initials
which already come attached to the titles (indicating chivalric
orders, if you must know). The GCMGs, KCVOs and DCBs would still be
bewildering, but at least they wouldn't get in the way. &QL;

DODGERS MOVE BONILLA TO BENCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Bobby Bonilla, batting only .190 since returning
from the disabled list nine days ago, has been benched by the
Dodgers in favor of a left-field platoon of Matt Luke and Trenidad
Hubbard.
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla, acquired from the Florida Marlins in the May 15 Mike
Piazza trade, came to the Dodgers to provide left-handed power and
leadership. But with the Dodgers struggling and Bonilla healing
from offseason surgery to his left wrist and left Achilles tendon,
the club ran out of patience.
</P>
<P>
   ``He simply isn't in shape to play left field,'' Dodgers manager
Glenn Hoffman said. ``We're not saying he is responsible for the
team's trouble. He's pretty banged up and can't do the job. It was
a mutual decision.''
</P>
<P>
   And an expensive one. Bonilla, 35, has two years remaining on
his contract at $5.9 million per season. The club made the decision
after interim general manager Tom Lasorda met with manager Glenn
Hoffman at 3 p.m. Hoffman then broke the news to Bonilla.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm OK with it, I'm not angry,'' Bonilla said. ``If they want
to blame this season on me they can. I haven't played well.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla homered last Sunday in a 2-1 loss to Pittsburgh. It was
his first home run since the first night he joined the club, a span
of 39 games and 136 at-bats. With the Dodgers, he is batting only
.200, and .202 from the all-important left side.
</P>
<P>
   But it was his defense that was most alarming. Bonilla had
difficulty getting to balls and became a target of booing fans at
Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the least of my problems,'' Bonilla said. ``I've
heard a lot worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda has been particularly frustrated with Bonilla's lack of
production. Before the July 31 non-waiver trade deadline, Lasorda
unsuccessfully tried to trade Bonilla to the St. Louis Cardinals
for outfielder Ron Gant.
</P>
<P>
   During the Dodgers' recent East Coast trip, Lasorda became upset
when Bonilla said the club should let him go home to rehabilitate
his injuries rather than wait for him to regain his 1997 form. He
drove in 96 runs for the World Series-champion Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they put me in left field, they knew I still had injuries
that would hurt my effectiveness,'' Bonilla said. ``(The injuries)
are getting better, but the doctors said both would take a year to
get back to normal.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, Bonilla will pinch hit and occasionally play third in
place of rookie Adrian Beltre. But even Hoffman said there does not
appear to be many at-bats in Bonilla's immediate future.
</P>
<P>
   ``We might want to give Beltre a day off against a certain
pitcher, but he's going to pretty much be in there,'' Hoffman said
of his rookie third baseman, who hit a two-run homer in the fourth
inning Thursday. ``We'll see what develops.''

<P>
   Many a patriotic Englishman would no doubt this week be tempted
to urge the queen to dub Sir Darren Gough or ennoble Lord Fraser of
Stout Bowling, to mark the astonishing fact that England has at
last won a top international cricket series.
</P>
<P>
   Such titles would at least have the merit of clarity: everyone
would know, at least while the memory lasted, why they had been
granted and what they signified. That is more than can be said for
most _ perhaps all _ of Britain's plethora of faux-aristocratic
titles.
</P>
<P>
   Who can say what Sir Reggie Bloggins actually did to get his
gong, or whether Lady Rhubarb is so-called on her own merit or that
of her husband's checkbook, or what the difference is between a
Viscount Bogtrotter and a Marquess of Bidet?
</P>
<P>
   There is a case for all this. Partly, it is a quaint British
reminder of its feudal history, partly, perhaps, a fairly cheap
system of incentives and rewards for political and public service
that may help restrain the nastier forms of corruption.
</P>
<P>
   It also provides pleasure to recipients and their relatives,
ample cause for gossip for others, and a source of pride to the
three people alive who know what all the titles mean.
</P>
<P>
   Yet that is where the problem lies. Apart from an admirable
fondness for history and tradition, other qualities commonly
associated with Britons include understatement and an instinct for
clarity rather than obfuscation.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, although attempts have been made to retire some
knightly orders and to hand out awards for merit rather than
timeserving, the mishmash of British titles suggests a rather
vulgar boastfulness while being almost wholly bewildering.
</P>
<P>
   Into this bewilderment has strode a voice of more-or-less
clarity, an ennobled one, no less.
</P>
<P>
   Baroness Jay, a life peer who has just been made leader of the
House of Lords, floated in an interview with the Daily Telegraph
the idea that once hereditary peers have been stripped of their
voting rights in the upper house, as Labour plans, the remaining
voting (i.e., life) peers should lose their titles and simply
attach ML, meaning member of the Lords, to their names.
</P>
<P>
   This idea is welcome, as far as it goes. Admittedly, it would
leave the top titles as exclusively a feudal relic rather than
sometimes a badge of actual distinction.
</P>
<P>
   But as the point of a title should be to convey some information
to others, saving them from embarrassment or hours of research,
this would be something of an improvement.
</P>
<P>
   On meeting Lord This or Baron That you would at least know they
were not a political has-been or a businessman being lured into
government, but rather that at some point in a past century they
had a notable ancestor, that it is best not to ask after their sons
or daughters because you will surely get those titles wrong, and
that they can probably afford to pay for dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it leaves many questions unanswered. How can you be a member
of the House of Lords if you are not a lord and if all the real
ones are excluded? This de-nobled house will need a new, suitably
clear, name.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are all those sirs, ladies and dames. The
quickest way to restore British modesty and clarity would be to
abolish the lot.
</P>
<P>
   But if British incrementalism wins out, a compromise could be to
scrap the titles but restrict the users to the sets of initials
which already come attached to the titles (indicating chivalric
orders, if you must know). The GCMGs, KCVOs and DCBs would still be
bewildering, but at least they wouldn't get in the way. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   The story of Madeleine Albright is enough to make a strong heart
gloomy.
</P>
<P>
   When she became U.S. secretary of state 18 months ago, things
seemed splendid. She was the first woman in the job; she had an
appealing personal story, as a childhood refugee from Hitler and
Stalin; she exuded the charm and fluency so important in the age of
television.
</P>
<P>
   She had more star power than any secretary of state since Henry
Kissinger, a fact especially noticeable because she succeeded
plodding Warren Christopher.
</P>
<P>
   Yet these days almost nobody speaks well of her. And this raises
painful questions about America's capacity for leadership.
</P>
<P>
   People said that Mrs. Albright's charm would invigorate foreign
policy. She knew how to get the rest of the administration on her
side. She knew how to persuade voters not to be bored by abroad.
She knew how to coax the chivalrous Southerner out of Jesse Helms,
the usually cantankerous chairman of the Senate foreign-relations
committee.
</P>
<P>
   And she sounded bold. She described America as the
``indispensable nation.'' She said her mindset was formed by Munich
rather than Vietnam, meaning that she would not shrink from using
force against tyranny.
</P>
<P>
   Early last year, Mrs. Albright's clout within the administration
helped to keep America engaged in Bosnia. But then her clout seemed
to wane.
</P>
<P>
   In May she delivered an ultimatum to Israel: cooperate on a new
peace plan, or America will be rough on you. Israel refused to
cooperate, but Clinton refused to get rough: Mrs. Albright seemed
to have less leverage at the White House than Israel's lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   As if to underline this point, the president recently appointed
her rival, Richard Holbrooke, as ambassador to the United Nations:
the word is that the secretary of state was informed rather than
consulted about this.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Albright's reputation for connecting with Middle America
has faded, too. In February, in a college gymnasium in Ohio, she
and two other top administration officials made the case for
containing Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   They failed to win over their audience, and this debacle helps
to explain why America's response to Iraq's current defiance of
U.N. sanctions has so far been mushy.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Albright's courtship of Helms has also delivered less than
had been hoped. It eased the passage of NATO enlargement in the
Senate, and helped get the chemical-weapons treaty through: both
considerable achievements. But Congress still refuses to pay
America's past U.N. dues, and jerks its knee at administration
policies from freeing trade to engaging China.
</P>
<P>
   Because Mrs. Albright has not always won the backing of the
president, voters and Congress, she has failed to deliver on her
bold rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   She promised a Munich mind-set; but NATO still shrinks from
deterring Serbian attacks on Kosovo. She promised that the
indispensable nation would make its influence felt; but Israel has
shown it can dispense with her advice quite cheerfully.
</P>
<P>
   Now, when Mrs. Albright promises that the terrorists who blew up
American embassies in Africa will be found and punished,
Washington's commentariat raises its eyebrows.
</P>
<P>
   What to make of this humiliation? Some say it shows that charm
and sound bites are no substitute for geopolitical grasp, or
(depending on the critic's point of view) for attention to detail.
</P>
<P>
   This is unfair. Mrs. Albright, a former academic, grasps
geopolitics as well as the next wonk; and she has deputies to worry
about detail.
</P>
<P>
   Others suggest that Mrs. Albright has been undermined by a
president who thinks about scandals more than foreign policy. But
Clinton has actually made foreign policy a feature of his second
term, so this is not the whole answer.
</P>
<P>
   The better explanation for Mrs. Albright's comedown lies not in
scandals or in her personal failings, but in the nature of her job.
Hence the painful possibility that whoever comes next will also
have trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Since the end of the Cold War, America's foreign ministers have
been in a bind. If they speak in vague and cautious tones, their
countrymen will be confirmed in their suspicion that foreign policy
is a hopeless muddle and may anyway no longer matter.
</P>
<P>
   This is what happened in Clinton's first term: Christopher was
grey, so Congress slashed the foreign-policy budget and other bits
of the administration grabbed juicy issues (Japan policy was run
first by the trade negotiators and then by the Pentagon).
</P>
<P>
   If foreign ministers speak boldly, on the other hand, they may
fall into Mrs. Albright's trap. They will command admiring
attention for a while. But they may fail to deliver on their bold
words, in which case humiliation will follow.
</P>
<P>
   This, of course, is a general problem of America's divided
government: each power center is tempted to proclaim a vision in
order to stay ahead of its rivals, but at the same time the
division of power tends to block the action needed to deliver on
the vision.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the problem is especially acute in foreign policy. For one
thing, the temptation to proclaim vision is uncommonly powerful:
you can get away with vision-free steadiness on transport policy,
but if you propose to risk soldiers' lives you need a
grand-sounding reason.
</P>
<P>
   For another, the task of living up to a vision is uncommonly
tough. Unlike roads, the myriad trouble spots of the post-Cold-War
world do not lie quietly there while you wonder how to fix them.
</P>
<P>
   Does this mean that the predicament of America's secretary of
state is hopeless? No: just difficult. It is possible, after all,
to imagine a set of conditions under which Mrs. Albright might have
fared better.
</P>
<P>
   If she had enjoyed a stronger personal relationship with
Clinton, she might have avoided the boomerang ultimatum to Israel.
If she had chosen a friendlier setting than a gym full of students,
she might have avoided the public relations debacle on what to do
about Saddam Hussein. If Clinton had been undistracted by scandal,
he might have backed her more vigorously in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the next secretary of state will succeed famously;
perhaps this one, as she probably deserves, will recover from her
woes. Alas, the odds are daunting. &QL;

<P>
   Now, when Mrs. Albright promises that the terrorists who blew up
American embassies in Africa will be found and punished,
Washington's commentariat raises its eyebrows.
</P>
<P>
   What to make of this humiliation? Some say it shows that charm
and sound bites are no substitute for geopolitical grasp, or
(depending on the critic's point of view) for attention to detail.
</P>
<P>
   This is unfair. Mrs. Albright, a former academic, grasps
geopolitics as well as the next wonk; and she has deputies to worry
about detail.
</P>
<P>
   Others suggest that Mrs. Albright has been undermined by a
president who thinks about scandals more than foreign policy. But
Clinton has actually made foreign policy a feature of his second
term, so this is not the whole answer.
</P>
<P>
   The better explanation for Mrs. Albright's comedown lies not in
scandals or in her personal failings, but in the nature of her job.
Hence the painful possibility that whoever comes next will also
have trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Since the end of the Cold War, America's foreign ministers have
been in a bind. If they speak in vague and cautious tones, their
countrymen will be confirmed in their suspicion that foreign policy
is a hopeless muddle and may anyway no longer matter.
</P>
<P>
   This is what happened in Clinton's first term: Christopher was
grey, so Congress slashed the foreign-policy budget and other bits
of the administration grabbed juicy issues (Japan policy was run
first by the trade negotiators and then by the Pentagon).
</P>
<P>
   If foreign ministers speak boldly, on the other hand, they may
fall into Mrs. Albright's trap. They will command admiring
attention for a while. But they may fail to deliver on their bold
words, in which case humiliation will follow.
</P>
<P>
   This, of course, is a general problem of America's divided
government: each power center is tempted to proclaim a vision in
order to stay ahead of its rivals, but at the same time the
division of power tends to block the action needed to deliver on
the vision.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the problem is especially acute in foreign policy. For one
thing, the temptation to proclaim vision is uncommonly powerful:
you can get away with vision-free steadiness on transport policy,
but if you propose to risk soldiers' lives you need a
grand-sounding reason.
</P>
<P>
   For another, the task of living up to a vision is uncommonly
tough. Unlike roads, the myriad trouble spots of the post-Cold-War
world do not lie quietly there while you wonder how to fix them.
</P>
<P>
   Does this mean that the predicament of America's secretary of
state is hopeless? No: just difficult. It is possible, after all,
to imagine a set of conditions under which Mrs. Albright might have
fared better.
</P>
<P>
   If she had enjoyed a stronger personal relationship with
Clinton, she might have avoided the boomerang ultimatum to Israel.
If she had chosen a friendlier setting than a gym full of students,
she might have avoided the public relations debacle on what to do
about Saddam Hussein. If Clinton had been undistracted by scandal,
he might have backed her more vigorously in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the next secretary of state will succeed famously;
perhaps this one, as she probably deserves, will recover from her
woes. Alas, the odds are daunting. &QL;

SOME SANCTIONS AGAINST SWISS ENDED IN WAKE OF SETTLEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS for inserts and to recast lede.)  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Calif., Pa.)  (lh) 
 By AMY WALDMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A day after the $1.25 billion settlement between Holocaust
survivors and Swiss commercial banks accused of profiting from the
Nazi era, officials in several states said that they would drop
threatened sanctions against Swiss financial interests, and a major
Swiss insurer facing a lawsuit from victims of the Holocaust agreed
to honor their outstanding life and property claims.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in New York, California, Pennsylvania and a number of
other cities and states had threatened to begin imposing sanctions
on Sept. 1, saying they were necessary to press the Swiss because
two years of negotiations had not led to a settlement. The State
Department had opposed the proposed penalties _ like barring
short-term deposits of city and state funds in Swiss banks _ saying
such pressure was hardening attitudes in Switzerland and souring
relations between Switzerland and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are pleased with the agreement'' with the banks, which was
announced Wednesday, said New York City Comptroller Alan Hevesi,
who heads a national committee of financial officers who have been
monitoring the negotiations. He said they ``have unanimously agreed
that we will cancel all planned sanctions.'' Hevesi spoke at a news
conference with New York state Comptroller Carl McCall.
</P>
<P>
   In California, state Treasurer Matt Fong, who had imposed some
sanctions on Swiss banks a year ago, announced that he was lifting
all investment sanctions effective immediately. Pennsylvania
Treasurer Barbara Hafer said she was also canceling proposed
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, Zurich Insurance Co. agreed to work with an
international commission to help process and settle unpaid claims
to Holocaust victims and their heirs, Reuters reported. Along with
15 other European insurers _ including two Swiss companies _ the
company is facing a class-action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court
in Manhattan by Holocaust survivors and their families who say the
companies withheld or concealed the value or proceeds of policies
sold before 1946.
</P>
<P>
   Jewish organizations and Holocaust survivors generally welcomed
the bank settlement as at least partial closure on a painful
chapter. ``It is a fair settlement,'' said Rabbi Marvin Hier, dean
of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles. ``I'm happy this is
over.''
</P>
<P>
   Jewish organizations took pains to stress that the settlement
was neither punishment for the banks nor a reward for survivors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not a question of a settlement; it is not a question of
money,'' said Benjamin Meed, president of the American Gathering of
Holocaust Survivors and a survivor of the Warsaw Ghetto. ``This is
a question of morality.''
</P>
<P>
   Leo Rechter, 70, who endured the Holocaust as a child and lost
his father to it, said that most Holocaust survivors would receive
little money. ``I think the Swiss could have done much better,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But lawyers for the plaintiffs said the amount roughly
corresponded to the amount of Jews' assets that were seized by the
Nazis and processed through Swiss banks. Joel Sweet, one of the
lawyers, said the settlement could establish an important global
precedent. ``When commercial actors profit illicitly from political
or human-rights abuses, they will be forced to pay,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Under the settlement, the major Swiss commercial banks, Credit
Suisse and Union Bank of Switzerland, agreed to guarantee payments
of $1.25 billion, plus any interest accrued before the payments are
made. As a result of mergers and acquisitions, the two banks now
represent 85 percent of Switzerland's commercial bank activity in
1945, lawyers for the plaintiffs said.
</P>
<P>
   In return, a class-action lawsuit against the commercial banks
in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn and a suit in the Northern
District in California will be dropped, as will a major suit
against the Government-owned Swiss National Bank in U.S. District
Court in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Although Credit Suisse recently purchased another of the Swiss
insurers named in the lawsuit, the settlement with the banks
specifically did not eliminate the suit against the insurance
companies, officials said Thursday, which may have prompted Zurich
Insurance Co.'s decision to cooperate in resolving the claims
against it.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the Swiss government nor the National Bank took part in
the negotiations, although evidence indicates the national bank
processed most of the gold looted from Jews by the Nazis, and
neither is expected to contribute to the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Hevesi praised Judge Edward Korman, who several weeks ago began
personally overseeing the talks, for ``putting parties in a room
and apparently not letting them out until there was an agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials familiar with the negotiations said as recently as
Monday that the two sides were still far apart. Negotiations had
broken down in June after the Swiss offered $600 million, a figure
the plaintiffs quickly rejected.
</P>
<P>
   But the sanctions deadline was looming and pressure from elected
officials and other public figures increasing and finally, on
Wednesday afternoon, a settlement was reached.
</P>
<P>
   The money will go, first, to those able to document claims to
dormant accounts in Swiss banks, which often denied survivors or
their relatives access to funds deposited before the war if they
lacked proper documentation. Paul Volcker, the former chairman of
the Federal Reserve, is leading a commission that is attempting to
match some 8,000 claims against the dormant accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Morris Ratner, an attorney for the plaintiffs, said the amount
paid out for dormant accounts would prove to be a ``small
percentage'' of the total, since so much evidence on specific
claims has been lost or destroyed over the last 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the money will be distributed to Holocaust survivors
through a mechanism yet to be determined. That money is considered
a form of ``rough justice,'' or restitution to those who cannot
prove their claims to lost assets, as well as for the profits Swiss
banks made from looted gold and art and from loans to the Nazis
that were used for the construction of slave-labor camps.
</P>
<P>
   The 10 law firms working on the case can apply to Korman for
fees, to be paid from the settlement money.
</P>
<P>
   After the judge gives preliminary approval to the settlement
amount, which could happen as early as next week, the Swiss banks
have 30 days to make the first payment of $250 million.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Amid the grime and misery of Baghdad, it is a strange sight: a
brand-new bright green shop front, full of sleek Italian clothes
and posters of wide-eyed African and Asian faces.
</P>
<P>
   As idle taxi drivers and peanut hawkers look on in envy, a
handful of well-to-do Iraqis rummage through racks of linen suits,
pick over piles of plaid shirts and try on designer jeans.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the devastation left by the Gulf war and the war with
Iran, and the economic paralysis that has been brought on by United
Nations sanctions, Benetton has made it to Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   The man who brought it there is also an unexpected sight.
Slight, short and shy, Ahmad Samha does not look like a daredevil
entrepreneur. In fact, it is hard to imagine how he manages to do
any business at all.
</P>
<P>
   In just three years and in the teeth of fearsome bureaucracy,
corruption and an instinctive suspicion of private enterprise, he
has built up a chain of 32 stores in Syria, all of which are
supplied from his own modern factory.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. embargo notwithstanding, Samha has managed to expand
into Iraq. By the end of the year he plans to open his first outlet
in Algeria. Iran is next on the list.
</P>
<P>
   Syria is not obviously a land of opportunity. It is
internationally isolated and economically troubled. Garment imports
are banned; and few foreign companies are interested in its small,
unstable market _ even though, thanks to a recent opening to
outside investment, foreign firms can set up joint ventures with
Syrian partners.
</P>
<P>
   If they bother with Syria at all, they tend to sell franchises
to local businessmen. Such is the deal that Benetton has done with
Samha, even though its international outlets normally sell only
stuff made in its Italian factories.
</P>
<P>
   Syria's state-controlled banks do not lend to entrepreneurs.
Private banks do not exist. So finding the money to start a
business is a struggle. Private companies labor under murky and
sometimes contradictory regulations designed to leave them
vulnerable to governmental whim.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, almost every successful businessman in Syria is
related, or at least closely connected, to a senior government
figure. Local partners or franchise-holders of foreign firms are
typically middlemen who oil cogs and grease palms so that the
outsiders can get on with selling their goods.
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty of doing business in Syria is Samha's challenge;
but it is also his opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Rogue states have rich people too, and rich people long for
foreign fashions. Fraught trade relations and off-putting
investment climates (to say the least) normally prevent them from
getting hold of the fancy imported goods they covet; which only
sharpens the desire.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, preferential trade agreements between Syria and other
Middle Eastern countries closed to western imports provide Samha's
company, Amal Samha, with a wide and sheltered market.
</P>
<P>
   Samha did not start with the political connections more usual
among successful businessmen. His father is not a minister, but a
carpenter. And he is a clothes maker, not a fixer.
</P>
<P>
   By the age of 11, he had already settled on his future career
when he took an after-school job at a tailor's. In 1977, aged 15,
he dropped out of school to work full-time on the four sewing
machines he had bought with his savings. (He still speaks only
Arabic.)
</P>
<P>
   By the time Benetton came to Syria to scout for a franchisee in
the mid-1990s, Samha owned a factory exporting clothes to Europe.
He knew the local shopkeepers, so was able to accelerate Benetton's
expansion in Syria by signing sub-franchises for individual stores.
With his own factory already running, it proved relatively easy to
set up the Benetton lines.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike his counterparts in Syria, who keep fingers in as many
pies as possible to spread the risk and distract the taxman, Samha
puts all his energy and earnings into a single trade.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a revolution in local retailing. Never before have
Syrians or Iraqis seen a chain of stores selling clothes of uniform
quality at fixed prices.
</P>
<P>
   The bright, clean, spacious shops, which are all designed to
Benetton's specifications, delight customers used to cluttered,
dimly-lit bazaars. The posters from Benetton's international
advertising campaigns, which concentrate on attractive foreign
faces rather than the company's clothes, shine out on the streets
of Aleppo and Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   Few local firms spend anything like the 5 percent of turnover
stipulated by Benetton on advertising. Amal _ the Arabic for hope _
is introducing the concept of a brand for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   But western marketing techniques carry risks. The Syrian
authorities hate the idea of western consumerism conquering their
semi-socialist society.
</P>
<P>
   They recently forced Damascus's first KFC outlet, which boasted
of its chicken from Kentucky, to change to something that smacked
less of cultural imperialism.
</P>
<P>
   The new Kuwaiti Food Company (still KFC) is also having trouble
competing with the city's countless roast-chicken stands, despite
fancy advertising and clean counters.
</P>
<P>
   For the time being, Amal has kept a low enough profile to avoid
unwanted attention from the authorities. Its prices are just high
enough to seem exclusive without being prohibitive.
</P>
<P>
   But Samha is stuck in a tight corner. As it is, he believes he
has saturated the Syrian market. His two stores in Baghdad are
patronized only by the tiny government elite that can still afford
such frivolities.
</P>
<P>
   After Iran, he will even have run out of rogue states
(Benetton's Egyptian franchisee has snapped up Libya).
</P>
<P>
   As long as the countries where Samha sells his clothes remain
politically unpredictable and economically stagnant, his potential
customer base will never expand much. But if they reform, they will
attract competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Samha may have found a niche, but it will never be a comfortable
one. &QL;

Astros sweep four-game series
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By CARLTON THOMPSON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
Larry Dierker is as cerebral as anyone when it comes to
understanding the nuances of baseball and why certain things happen
the way they do.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he can't figure out how his team keeps finding a
different way to write a winning script night after night. The
theme for Thursday's game was revenge, and Ricky Gutierrez played
the starring role, driving in three runs in a 6-2 victory over the
Milwaukee Brewers in the Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros completed a four-game sweep of the Brewers _ their
first since taking four games from Montreal in July 1997.
</P>
<P>
   After falling behind early, the Astros did what they seem to do
at will: come back. Thursday's victory marked the 36th time the
Astros have come from behind to win a game this season. They
increased their winning streak to seven games and have won 14 of
their past 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't expect us to streak right on through the end of the
season,'' Dierker said. ``But it sure is more fun this way. I know
I've said it before, but we just keep finding a way to get it done,
and it seems to be a different guy every night.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Gutierrez was the hero after Brewers manager Phil
Garner all but dared him to get a hit. Garner ordered starting
pitcher Steve Woodard to intentionally walk Craig Biggio twice,
choosing to pitch to Gutierrez.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every hitter who is put into that situation is going to take
it as a challenge,'' said Dierker, who seldom calls for intentional
walks. ``It's a gamble. If you put a guy on base, the risk you take
is that he might score, and a lot of other guys might score.''
</P>
<P>
   The first spin of the roulette wheel favored Garner, but the
move backfired when Garner tried it again in the fourth.
Gutierrez's first triple of the season was the game-winning hit.
Normally, Gutierrez is low-key on the field, but he didn't hide his
feelings as after he slid safely into third.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of emotions for me right there,'' Gutierrez
said. ``It's always satisfying when they walk someone to get to you
and then you get the big hit. After he (Garner) did it the first
time, I knew he would do it again. That was very satisfying.''
</P>
<P>
   Biggio is a perennial All-Star and a dangerous hitter, but it's
not often an opposing team intentionally walks the leadoff hitter
twice in the same game. Biggio had been the recipient of only three
intentional walks before Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Biggio's been the guy for them,'' Brewers third baseman Jeff
Cirillo said. ``Garner said we weren't going to let him beat us. He
(Gutierrez) failed the first time, but the second time he got the
big hit. It's a tough call with their lineup. It's pick your poison
with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's winning potion would not have been complete without a
dose of Jose Lima, who pitched five-hit ball for eight innings.
Billy Wagner worked the ninth in a non-save situation.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros took advantage of seven walks and got the most out of
their seven hits. They took a 1-0 lead in the first when Gutierrez
singled and scored on a base hit by Moises Alou.
</P>
<P>
   The Brewers tied it in the second when Jeromy Burnitz belted a
leadoff double off the center-field wall and scored on John Jaha's
RBI single. Lima retired the first two batters he faced in the
third but allowed the following three to reach, including Cirillo,
who singled home the Brewers' second run of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Woodard retired the Astros in order in the third but encountered
trouble in the fourth. Dave Clark and Sean Berry drew back-to-back
walks before Woodard recorded two quick outs. With first open,
Biggio was put on, but then Gutierrez ripped a three-run triple
into the right-center-field gap to give the Astros a 4-2 lead,
which they never surrendered.
</P>
<P>
   The three RBIs matched a career high for Gutierrez and gave him
a career-high 36 for the season.
</P>
<P>
   Pete Incaviglia's pinch-hit double off the left-field wall
scored two runs in the eighth. The hit came in Incaviglia's first
plate appearance since the Astros called him up from the minors
this week.

related, or at least closely connected, to a senior government
figure. Local partners or franchise-holders of foreign firms are
typically middlemen who oil cogs and grease palms so that the
outsiders can get on with selling their goods.
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty of doing business in Syria is Samha's challenge;
but it is also his opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Rogue states have rich people too, and rich people long for
foreign fashions. Fraught trade relations and off-putting
investment climates (to say the least) normally prevent them from
getting hold of the fancy imported goods they covet; which only
sharpens the desire.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, preferential trade agreements between Syria and other
Middle Eastern countries closed to western imports provide Samha's
company, Amal Samha, with a wide and sheltered market.
</P>
<P>
   Samha did not start with the political connections more usual
among successful businessmen. His father is not a minister, but a
carpenter. And he is a clothes maker, not a fixer.
</P>
<P>
   By the age of 11, he had already settled on his future career
when he took an after-school job at a tailor's. In 1977, aged 15,
he dropped out of school to work full-time on the four sewing
machines he had bought with his savings. (He still speaks only
Arabic.)
</P>
<P>
   By the time Benetton came to Syria to scout for a franchisee in
the mid-1990s, Samha owned a factory exporting clothes to Europe.
He knew the local shopkeepers, so was able to accelerate Benetton's
expansion in Syria by signing sub-franchises for individual stores.
With his own factory already running, it proved relatively easy to
set up the Benetton lines.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike his counterparts in Syria, who keep fingers in as many
pies as possible to spread the risk and distract the taxman, Samha
puts all his energy and earnings into a single trade.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a revolution in local retailing. Never before have
Syrians or Iraqis seen a chain of stores selling clothes of uniform
quality at fixed prices.
</P>
<P>
   The bright, clean, spacious shops, which are all designed to
Benetton's specifications, delight customers used to cluttered,
dimly-lit bazaars. The posters from Benetton's international
advertising campaigns, which concentrate on attractive foreign
faces rather than the company's clothes, shine out on the streets
of Aleppo and Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   Few local firms spend anything like the 5 percent of turnover
stipulated by Benetton on advertising. Amal _ the Arabic for hope _
is introducing the concept of a brand for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   But western marketing techniques carry risks. The Syrian
authorities hate the idea of western consumerism conquering their
semi-socialist society.
</P>
<P>
   They recently forced Damascus's first KFC outlet, which boasted
of its chicken from Kentucky, to change to something that smacked
less of cultural imperialism.
</P>
<P>
   The new Kuwaiti Food Company (still KFC) is also having trouble
competing with the city's countless roast-chicken stands, despite
fancy advertising and clean counters.
</P>
<P>
   For the time being, Amal has kept a low enough profile to avoid
unwanted attention from the authorities. Its prices are just high
enough to seem exclusive without being prohibitive.
</P>
<P>
   But Samha is stuck in a tight corner. As it is, he believes he
has saturated the Syrian market. His two stores in Baghdad are
patronized only by the tiny government elite that can still afford
such frivolities.
</P>
<P>
   After Iran, he will even have run out of rogue states
(Benetton's Egyptian franchisee has snapped up Libya).
</P>
<P>
   As long as the countries where Samha sells his clothes remain
politically unpredictable and economically stagnant, his potential
customer base will never expand much. But if they reform, they will
attract competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Samha may have found a niche, but it will never be a comfortable
one. &QL;

<P>
   Amid the grime and misery of Baghdad, it is a strange sight: a
brand-new bright green shop front, full of sleek Italian clothes
and posters of wide-eyed African and Asian faces.
</P>
<P>
   As idle taxi drivers and peanut hawkers look on in envy, a
handful of well-to-do Iraqis rummage through racks of linen suits,
pick over piles of plaid shirts and try on designer jeans.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the devastation left by the Gulf war and the war with
Iran, and the economic paralysis that has been brought on by United
Nations sanctions, Benetton has made it to Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   The man who brought it there is also an unexpected sight.
Slight, short and shy, Ahmad Samha does not look like a daredevil
entrepreneur. In fact, it is hard to imagine how he manages to do
any business at all.
</P>
<P>
   In just three years and in the teeth of fearsome bureaucracy,
corruption and an instinctive suspicion of private enterprise, he
has built up a chain of 32 stores in Syria, all of which are
supplied from his own modern factory.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. embargo notwithstanding, Samha has managed to expand
into Iraq. By the end of the year he plans to open his first outlet
in Algeria. Iran is next on the list.
</P>
<P>
   Syria is not obviously a land of opportunity. It is
internationally isolated and economically troubled. Garment imports
are banned; and few foreign companies are interested in its small,
unstable market _ even though, thanks to a recent opening to
outside investment, foreign firms can set up joint ventures with
Syrian partners.
</P>
<P>
   If they bother with Syria at all, they tend to sell franchises
to local businessmen. Such is the deal that Benetton has done with
Samha, even though its international outlets normally sell only
stuff made in its Italian factories.
</P>
<P>
   Syria's state-controlled banks do not lend to entrepreneurs.
Private banks do not exist. So finding the money to start a
business is a struggle. Private companies labor under murky and
sometimes contradictory regulations designed to leave them
vulnerable to governmental whim.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, almost every successful businessman in Syria is
related, or at least closely connected, to a senior government
figure. Local partners or franchise-holders of foreign firms are
typically middlemen who oil cogs and grease palms so that the
outsiders can get on with selling their goods.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON AND NEW YORK _ Dismissively, John D. Rockefeller once
referred to the early days of the American oil industry as
``harvest time'': anybody could get rich simply by digging a hole
in the ground.
</P>
<P>
   His generation, he maintained, lived through harsher times, and
got rich through their organizational flair, or not at all. He
turned his genius to consolidation, and it made him very rich
indeed.
</P>
<P>
   With the price of Brent Crude at its lowest level in real terms
for 25 years, harsh times are here again _ and so, it appears, is
the Rockefeller vision.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest industrial merger ever, between British Petroleum
and Amoco, may herald a new era of consolidation in an industry
where mergers have been scarce of late.
</P>
<P>
   BP, whose American wing is based around the Ohio part of
Rockefeller's Standard Oil empire, is paying $48 billion to acquire
Amoco, which was created from Standard Oil of Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   Although this represents a steepish 15 percent premium over
Amoco's pre-bid value, the merger has been applauded as a good fit:
BP is generally better at the upstream part of the business
(finding and extracting oil); Amoco at the downstream business of
refining, distributing and marketing the stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Amoco's stronghold is the United States _ hitherto a weak spot
for BP. And the Chicago-based firm beefs up BP's gas and
petrochemicals divisions.
</P>
<P>
   As these empires are meshed together, there should be plenty of
savings. Sir John Browne, BP's boss, who will also head the new
company, has a flair for cutting costs that Rockefeller might have
appreciated: BP's work force now has fewer than half the 112,000
people it had in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Some 6,000 of the 99,000 jobs at the new BP Amoco are already
earmarked to go; managers' bonuses will be tied to producing $2
billion in annual pre-tax savings by the end of 2000. Businesses
that are not number one or two in their segments are likely to be
sold.
</P>
<P>
   All the same, Sir John promises much more than mere
cost-cutting. He describes both BP and Amoco as being ``at the top
of the second division.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal will put the new BP Amoco in a first division of
``super majors,'' alongside Exxon and Royal Dutch/Shell. The new
firm will on some counts be these firms' equal: it will, for
instance, have more oil and gas reserves than Exxon.
</P>
<P>
   More important, the merger puts BP in a different league from
all the other companies in the business.
</P>
<P>
   As a competitive tactic, this has already worked well. The oil
industry is now abuzz with gossip about further consolidation
involving BP's former peers, such as Chevron, Mobil and Texaco.
</P>
<P>
   BP's bosses even speculate that the news may have caused a
frisson of pain in Shell House, where its old enemy had been
concentrating on overtaking Exxon.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the question of whether the oil industry is charging in the
right direction remains unanswered.
</P>
<P>
   With stocks of oil at record levels, demand depressed in Asia,
and members of the OPEC oil cartel always ready to cheat on their
quotas, there is little hope of a dramatic rise in the oil price in
the near future.
</P>
<P>
   Having been hustled out of the Middle East long ago, all the
majors are heavily dependent on giant fields that were discovered
decades ago, many of which (particularly those in North America and
Europe) are starting to decline.
</P>
<P>
   The great task for today's oil firms is to replace these ``crown
jewels.'' In recent years a mere handful of fields containing more
than 500 million barrels have been discovered, in contrast with
dozens of big new discoveries in previous decades.
</P>
<P>
   Deep-water reserves, such as those in the Gulf of Mexico and off
the coast of West Africa, are expensive to extract. Russia, which
sits on 5 percent of the world's proven oil reserves, is prickly.
</P>
<P>
   Last year BP took a 10 percent stake in Russia's Sidanco; it
recently reported a $20 million loss due to problems there.
</P>
<P>
   The Caspian, where both BP and Amoco have struck deals, is stuck
in a tortuous geopolitical argument over the route of pipelines
from the area.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly there is natural gas: demand for the stuff is growing
more rapidly than demand for oil, in part because burning it
produces less pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Amoco has large reserves of gas. In 1988 it bought Dome
Petroleum, a Canadian gas firm, for $4.2 billion. But transporting
gas is difficult and it has no international spot market, forcing
producers to find long-term buyers before any big investment in a
gas field, which can be a long process.
</P>
<P>
   BP thinks the merger will help it deal with these difficulties.
Simply by having a broader range of countries, it should be less
vulnerable than most to upsets in any one place: Shell's problems
in Nigeria made only a small dent in its performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your appetite for risk is a function of how much capital you
have,'' one senior figure stresses. ``Now we can afford to make
bigger bets.''
</P>
<P>
   Both BP and Amoco have often had to go into partnership on big
oil deals; now they can bid alone.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a growing tendency by governments to demand that
oil companies do more than just extract oil; they have to build
infrastructure as well _ once again pushing up the cost.
</P>
<P>
   BP and Amoco also say that they will reconsider the liquefied
natural gas industry that they have shied away from in the past. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 950. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   In all this, Sir John is careful to talk about size being an
``outcome, not an aim'' and stresses his willingness to sell
businesses as well as enter them. He is adamant, however, that
scale does matter in some areas _ and even in the fashionable
business of knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   He claims that BP's profit growth has partly stemmed from
transferring expertise (in drilling technology, for instance)
around the company; now these skills, built at great expense, can
be put to work across a much wider group at little extra cost. The
same logic would presumably apply to Amoco's flair for retailing.
</P>
<P>
   This is an intriguing vision. But the case for size and
creativity within a super major remains unproven. BP's return on
capital employed _ the main benchmark of profitability amongst big
oil firms _ was 14 percent in the 12 months to the end of June,
well above Shell's figure of 10 percent (Amoco scored even lower at
9 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Shell is even now starting a restructuring drive that may clamp
back on investment. As for Exxon, its 14.5 percent return has been
achieved more by returning its capital to investors through share
buybacks than by using it to grow bigger.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the oil industry's future may turn on two things where
nimbleness may count for more than size.
</P>
<P>
   The first is the long-awaited introduction of other forms of
energy _ a development where large reserves of oil may actually
prove a handicap. The other, more immediate possibility is the
reentry of western firms to the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   This is the real prize in the oil industry, both because of the
Middle East's reserves and because it still costs less than $2 a
barrel to extract oil there.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, while OPEC, which is dominated by Middle Eastern
producers, owns three-quarters of the world's proven reserves, it
currently produces only 41 percent of the world's annual oil
supply.
</P>
<P>
   This means that as non-OPEC supplies begin to dwindle, or are
made uncompetitive because of the low oil price, the importance of
the Middle East is likely to grow.
</P>
<P>
   So far, winning deals in the Middle East seems to depend in
larger part on the political astuteness and lobbying skills of oil
bosses than on the size of their capital base.
</P>
<P>
   French oil firms, such as Total and Elf, have had a head start
in negotiating deals in Iran and Iraq because their government is
more friendly to these regimes.
</P>
<P>
   As Rockefeller discovered, even the best-organized oil firms can
be undermined by politicking. &QL;

   More important, the merger puts BP in a different league from
all the other companies in the business.
</P>
<P>
   As a competitive tactic, this has already worked well. The oil
industry is now abuzz with gossip about further consolidation
involving BP's former peers, such as Chevron, Mobil and Texaco.
</P>
<P>
   BP's bosses even speculate that the news may have caused a
frisson of pain in Shell House, where its old enemy had been
concentrating on overtaking Exxon.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the question of whether the oil industry is charging in the
right direction remains unanswered.
</P>
<P>
   With stocks of oil at record levels, demand depressed in Asia,
and members of the OPEC oil cartel always ready to cheat on their
quotas, there is little hope of a dramatic rise in the oil price in
the near future.
</P>
<P>
   Having been hustled out of the Middle East long ago, all the
majors are heavily dependent on giant fields that were discovered
decades ago, many of which (particularly those in North America and
Europe) are starting to decline.
</P>
<P>
   The great task for today's oil firms is to replace these ``crown
jewels.'' In recent years a mere handful of fields containing more
than 500 million barrels have been discovered, in contrast with
dozens of big new discoveries in previous decades.
</P>
<P>
   Deep-water reserves, such as those in the Gulf of Mexico and off
the coast of West Africa, are expensive to extract. Russia, which
sits on 5 percent of the world's proven oil reserves, is prickly.
</P>
<P>
   Last year BP took a 10 percent stake in Russia's Sidanco; it
recently reported a $20 million loss due to problems there.
</P>
<P>
   The Caspian, where both BP and Amoco have struck deals, is stuck
in a tortuous geopolitical argument over the route of pipelines
from the area.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly there is natural gas: demand for the stuff is growing
more rapidly than demand for oil, in part because burning it
produces less pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Amoco has large reserves of gas. In 1988 it bought Dome
Petroleum, a Canadian gas firm, for $4.2 billion. But transporting
gas is difficult and it has no international spot market, forcing
producers to find long-term buyers before any big investment in a
gas field, which can be a long process.
</P>
<P>
   BP thinks the merger will help it deal with these difficulties.
Simply by having a broader range of countries, it should be less
vulnerable than most to upsets in any one place: Shell's problems
in Nigeria made only a small dent in its performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your appetite for risk is a function of how much capital you
have,'' one senior figure stresses. ``Now we can afford to make
bigger bets.''
</P>
<P>
   Both BP and Amoco have often had to go into partnership on big
oil deals; now they can bid alone.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a growing tendency by governments to demand that
oil companies do more than just extract oil; they have to build
infrastructure as well _ once again pushing up the cost.
</P>
<P>
   BP and Amoco also say that they will reconsider the liquefied
natural gas industry that they have shied away from in the past. &QL;

<P>
   In all this, Sir John is careful to talk about size being an
``outcome, not an aim'' and stresses his willingness to sell
businesses as well as enter them. He is adamant, however, that
scale does matter in some areas _ and even in the fashionable
business of knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   He claims that BP's profit growth has partly stemmed from
transferring expertise (in drilling technology, for instance)
around the company; now these skills, built at great expense, can
be put to work across a much wider group at little extra cost. The
same logic would presumably apply to Amoco's flair for retailing.
</P>
<P>
   This is an intriguing vision. But the case for size and
creativity within a super major remains unproven. BP's return on
capital employed _ the main benchmark of profitability amongst big
oil firms _ was 14 percent in the 12 months to the end of June,
well above Shell's figure of 10 percent (Amoco scored even lower at
9 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Shell is even now starting a restructuring drive that may clamp
back on investment. As for Exxon, its 14.5 percent return has been
achieved more by returning its capital to investors through share
buybacks than by using it to grow bigger.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the oil industry's future may turn on two things where
nimbleness may count for more than size.
</P>
<P>
   The first is the long-awaited introduction of other forms of
energy _ a development where large reserves of oil may actually
prove a handicap. The other, more immediate possibility is the
reentry of western firms to the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   This is the real prize in the oil industry, both because of the
Middle East's reserves and because it still costs less than $2 a
barrel to extract oil there.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, while OPEC, which is dominated by Middle Eastern
producers, owns three-quarters of the world's proven reserves, it
currently produces only 41 percent of the world's annual oil
supply.
</P>
<P>
   This means that as non-OPEC supplies begin to dwindle, or are
made uncompetitive because of the low oil price, the importance of
the Middle East is likely to grow.
</P>
<P>
   So far, winning deals in the Middle East seems to depend in
larger part on the political astuteness and lobbying skills of oil
bosses than on the size of their capital base.
</P>
<P>
   French oil firms, such as Total and Elf, have had a head start
in negotiating deals in Iran and Iraq because their government is
more friendly to these regimes.
</P>
<P>
   As Rockefeller discovered, even the best-organized oil firms can
be undermined by politicking. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON AND NEW YORK _ Dismissively, John D. Rockefeller once
referred to the early days of the American oil industry as
``harvest time'': anybody could get rich simply by digging a hole
in the ground.
</P>
<P>
   His generation, he maintained, lived through harsher times, and
got rich through their organizational flair, or not at all. He
turned his genius to consolidation, and it made him very rich
indeed.
</P>
<P>
   With the price of Brent Crude at its lowest level in real terms
for 25 years, harsh times are here again _ and so, it appears, is
the Rockefeller vision.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest industrial merger ever, between British Petroleum
and Amoco, may herald a new era of consolidation in an industry
where mergers have been scarce of late.
</P>
<P>
   BP, whose American wing is based around the Ohio part of
Rockefeller's Standard Oil empire, is paying $48 billion to acquire
Amoco, which was created from Standard Oil of Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   Although this represents a steepish 15 percent premium over
Amoco's pre-bid value, the merger has been applauded as a good fit:
BP is generally better at the upstream part of the business
(finding and extracting oil); Amoco at the downstream business of
refining, distributing and marketing the stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Amoco's stronghold is the United States _ hitherto a weak spot
for BP. And the Chicago-based firm beefs up BP's gas and
petrochemicals divisions.
</P>
<P>
   As these empires are meshed together, there should be plenty of
savings. Sir John Browne, BP's boss, who will also head the new
company, has a flair for cutting costs that Rockefeller might have
appreciated: BP's work force now has fewer than half the 112,000
people it had in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Some 6,000 of the 99,000 jobs at the new BP Amoco are already
earmarked to go; managers' bonuses will be tied to producing $2
billion in annual pre-tax savings by the end of 2000. Businesses
that are not number one or two in their segments are likely to be
sold.
</P>
<P>
   All the same, Sir John promises much more than mere
cost-cutting. He describes both BP and Amoco as being ``at the top
of the second division.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal will put the new BP Amoco in a first division of
``super majors,'' alongside Exxon and Royal Dutch/Shell. The new
firm will on some counts be these firms' equal: it will, for
instance, have more oil and gas reserves than Exxon.
</P>
<P>
   More important, the merger puts BP in a different league from
all the other companies in the business.
</P>
<P>
   As a competitive tactic, this has already worked well. The oil
industry is now abuzz with gossip about further consolidation
involving BP's former peers, such as Chevron, Mobil and Texaco.
</P>
<P>
   BP's bosses even speculate that the news may have caused a
frisson of pain in Shell House, where its old enemy had been
concentrating on overtaking Exxon.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the question of whether the oil industry is charging in the
right direction remains unanswered.
</P>

   With stocks of oil at record levels, demand depressed in Asia,
and members of the OPEC oil cartel always ready to cheat on their
quotas, there is little hope of a dramatic rise in the oil price in
the near future.

LEVIS TRIES A DIFFERENT KIND OF AD CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By COURTNEY KANE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In its quest to remain hip with America's youth, Levi Strauss &AMP;
Co. is introducing a campaign infused with an unconventional,
streetwise attitude for its Silver Tab line of clothing.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of using typical models to showcase the clothing, the
Silver Tab campaign features colorful, illustrated images of
teen-agers hanging out, displaying their individuality and
self-expression by, of course, wearing Silver Tab clothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our strategy was to take fashion ads from the catwalk to the
sidewalk and to be part of street culture,'' said Lorraine Ketch,
managing partner and account planning director at TBWA Chiat/Day in
San Francisco, Levi Strauss' agency. In doing so, Ms. Ketch said,
the illustrative art is ``the only style we felt that would allow
us to become part of the scene'' to attract the younger audience.
</P>
<P>
   To reach its target consumers, 15- to 25-year-olds, TBWA
Chiat/Day sent out employees to build a network of contacts
familiar with the urban scene, including club-hoppers, stylists,
photographers and disk jockeys. The agency kept a scrapbook of
Polaroid pictures of different people and looks and separated them
into seven ``tribes'' that are defined by the music they like,
including the repetitive synthetic music known as electronica;
hip-hop and rap, and retro soul, music from the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to speak to the tribes in their language, have some
fun and make Silver Tab part of the scene without being overt or
contrived,'' Ms. Ketch said. ``You've seen it a million times,
fashion advertising dominated by perfect models with serious, aloof
attitudes and empty messages that are not inspirational images to
these groups. In fact, they have nothing whatsoever in common with
the people wearing them on the street.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ketch added: ``This audience hates marketing that's in your
face. It eyeballs it a mile away, chews it up and spits it out.''
</P>
<P>
   The print and outdoor campaign for the brand, with billings
estimated at $10 million, is the fourth for Levi Strauss from TBWA
Chiat/Day, part of the TBWA Chiat/Day International unit of Omnicom
Group. The new campaign is not the first time Levi Strauss has used
illustrative art rather than photographs. In 1991 and 1992,
illustrations were the centerpiece of its Levi's Jeans for Women
campaign, which was created by its previous longtime agency, Foote,
Cone &AMP; Belding in San Francisco, part of True North Communications.
</P>
<P>
   The Silver Tab advertisements, which were designed by Graham
Rounthwaite, a graphic illustrator in London, blend ethnicities and
blur racial definitions with muted skin tones and exotic hair
colors, including aqua blue, lilac and orange.
</P>
<P>
   Kendra Kallan, senior advertising manager for Silver Tab in San
Francisco, said the campaign ``uses style to bring kids together on
their turf,'' adding, ``It's a virtual melting pot of cultures and
races linked by similar interests and diversity.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One ad, which is meant to appeal to the hip-hop and rap culture,
features the the statement ``It's bangin' son,'' which translates
into ``cool'' for baby boomers. Teen-agers are featured clad in
Silver Tab clothing including baggy pants, hip huggers and tiny
tops, with accessories as varied as chunky gold jewelry, nose
rings, beepers, knapsacks, baseball caps and tattoos. A second ad,
meant to appeal to the retro soul tribe, carries the statement
``Outtamyhead.'' Translation: ``Everything is great.'' It features
a woman wearing platform shoes and flared bell-bottom jeans, who
looks as if she just stepped out of ``Soul Train.'' All the ads
carry the Silver Tab logo.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Hogan, director for consumer marketing at Levi Strauss,
said: ``People are able to project themselves into these settings
and relate to these characters more than they can relate to a
supermodel. It's a unique and different approach in a category that
has a lot of competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Levi Strauss is being squeezed from all sides. The company has
been losing market share as fickle young consumers abandon the
brand in favor of higher-priced designer brands sold by Calvin
Klein, Diesel, Tommy Hilfiger USA, Polo Ralph Lauren and Versace,
and lower-priced brands like Canyon River Blues sold by Sears,
Roebuck &AMP; Co. and Arizona sold by the J.C. Penney Co.. And small,
fashion-focused companies like JNCO, Fubu and Kik Wear have proved
more adept at introducing the styles now favored by teen-agers,
like baggy, wide-legged jeans.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign comes during the annual push in the jeans market as
marketers gear up for the back-to-school shopping season. Several
Levi Strauss competitors recently introduced new campaigns,
including Diesel and the Kmart Corp., which is promoting its Route
66 private-label jeans.
</P>
<P>
   The Levi Strauss campaign, which will run through the end of the
year, will begin next month on billboards, buildings, buses and bus
shelters and in subway stations in 10 cities including Atlanta,
Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York and San Francisco.
Advertisements will also appear in music magazines like Rolling
Stone, Spin and Vibe, alternative magazines like Blaze, Bikini,
Interview and Paper, and fashion magazines like Elle, Jane,
Seventeen and Vogue.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kallan said that the Levi Strauss brand ``is thriving on the
unexpected in its advertising this year.''
</P>
<P>
   ``With the Silver Tab urban art campaign, we continue to
communicate with our consumers in a way that's real and relevant to
their life style,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Hogan said the campaign ``hopefully says to kids that we're
cool.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We really understand them,'' he said, ``but we are not trying
too hard.''

By SCOTT FRENCH  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a long, long time in coming, but Carlos Hermosillo -- the
Mexican goalscorer whose juices appeared to have dried up --
finally found the net Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   And, as so many surrounding the Los Angeles Galaxy had
predicted, it led to an onslaught of sorts.
</P>
<P>
   Hermosillo, goalless in his first 10 Major League Soccer
matches, scored a pair -- and nearly netted a third -- as the
Galaxy claimed its postseason berth and broke the league's seasonal
scoring record with a 3-0 romp over the Kansas City Wizards before
10,291 at the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with a magic stone -- a good-luck gift presented Wednesday
by the Galaxians, L.A.'s supporters' group -- Hermosillo scored off
scrambles in the Wizards' box in the 76th and 78th minutes, giving
L.A. (19-6, 55 points) 71 goals this season, one better than D.C.'s
record total set last year.
</P>
<P>
   After his first, Hermosillo saluted the Galaxians, then put his
right forefinger to his lips, an effort to shush his critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not even in my dreams have I gone so long without a goal,'' he
said afterward, garbed in a Galaxian T-shirt. ``These two ease the
tension. When you have a lot of opportunities through the season, I
started to doubt myself at times. But I was able to come through.''
</P>
<P>
   Cobi Jones also had a goal, his 13th of the season, and a Robin
Fraser-led L.A. defense limited the Wizards (10-13, 26) to four
shots, just one of them on goal.
</P>
<P>
   It was enough to give the Galaxy a playoff spot that had never
been in doubt, complete their season sweep of Kansas City, give
Kevin Hartman (who had to make only one save) his fourth shutout
and third against the Wizards, and boost L.A.'s winning streak to
three games after dropping four of the previous five.
</P>
<P>
   With the other piece of news L.A. received -- that Ecuadoran
midfielder Wellington Sanchez, sold July 24 to Mexico's Morelia,
would remain with the Galaxy through the end of the MLS campaign --
it made for a mighty fine Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Galaxy coach Octavio Zambrano wasn't overly pleased with
his squad's effort, unhappy with how his forwards dealt with the
Wizards' man-to-man marking in the back. That, along with the
Galaxy defense's performance, led to a battle contested primarily
in midfield and lacking excitement until Hermosillo took charge
late.
</P>
<P>
   There was only one shot on target in the first half, Jones'
goal, off the best piece of work all night. All credit goes to
Martin Machon, who sent with the outside of his left foot a 50-yard
pass from deep in L.A. territory, finding space behind the Kansas
City back line. Jones turned on the afterburners, leaving three
Wizards' defenders in his dust, and picked up the ball at the edge
of the box. He touched it once, then fired to goalkeeper Mike
Ammann's left, inside the right post.
</P>
<P>
   L.A. had several chances in the second half -- the best a Welton
header cleared off the goal line in the 51st minute -- but nothing
fell until Welton beat Scott Uderitz on the left wing, then sent a
roller to Hermosillo at the near post.
</P>
<P>
   The big Mexican tried to turn to his left, then cut back the
other way, swiping the ball past Ammann.
</P>
<P>
   Little more than a minute later, he got his second, blasting
home a rebound after Sean Bowers cleared a Welton shot off the
line.
</P>
<P>
   The goals may have been more important than the win, especially
if it sends Hermosillo -- who scored a record 275 goals in Mexican
League play and another 36 for Mexico's national team -- on a tear.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's happy to get that off his mind,'' said Zambrano.
``Anytime a scorer goes that long without scoring, it's very tough
on him. For him to get those two goals, that should ease a lot on
his mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Hermosillo: ``This is a new start of the season for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez, 24, didn't see any action Thursday, but his return to
the the Galaxy -- after what General Manager Danny Villanueva
called a ``financial glitch'' -- provides the team advanced
midfield depth heading into the final stretch of the regular season
and playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The money problem apparently surfaced in Morelia, although
Villanueva said he wasn't sure about the details. Sanchez, who
hadn't left for Mexico, won't join the club until the MLS season is
over.

MOON CAUSES NO WAVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHENEY, Wash. _ Warren Moon's first practice after ending his
25-day holdout was more pomp than circumstance.
</P>
<P>
   A crowd of more than 2,000 fans lined the fences around the
practice fields at the Seahawks' training camp Thursday, and most
were there to see the return of the team's starting quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Moon, however, won't reclaim that position until Monday _ after
Jon Kitna has started Saturday night's preseason game against the
San Francisco 49ers in Vancouver, B.C., and the team has returned
to its regular training facility in Kirkland.
</P>
<P>
   What the fans saw in the final practice at Cheney was Moon
taking just four snaps with the No. 3 offense. He handed off twice
to Michael Black, a rookie free agent from Washington State, and
completed two short passes to a couple of rookie free-agent
receivers _ Brian Finneran and Chris Jackson, another ex-Cougar.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was easy. I didn't have to do too much,'' said Moon, who
will not play against the 49ers. ``I only got a few reps in each of
the periods, but it was good to get under the center again and at
least take a snap, make a read and throw a pass and complete it.''
</P>
<P>
   Moon's return went more smoothly than might have been
anticipated _ for him; for Kitna, who has played well in Moon's
absence; and for their teammates, who have gained confidence in
Kitna because of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough situation for anybody,'' Moon said. ``But I think
(Kitna) knew the situation before it happened, and I'm sure he knew
it was going to be resolved at some point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Jon just wanted to take advantage of the work he was
getting, and the work he was getting really paid off for him,''
Moon said. ``He's doing a really good job right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Moon could be compensated handsomely if he can lead the Seahawks
to their first playoff berth since 1988. As part of the incentives
attached to the two-year, $4.97 million contract he agreed to
Wednesday and is expected to sign Friday, Moon will receive $75,000
for each game he starts during the regular season, another $150,000
if the Seahawks win 10 games and $250,000 if they make the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   If it all happens, Moon will pocket an extra $1.6 million if he
is still on the roster in March.
</P>
<P>
   As for Kitna, he figured Moon would return sooner or later and
said he actually is relieved it finally happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as Warren ran out on that field (Wednesday), it was
like a burden being lifted off my shoulders,'' the third-year
quarterback from Central Washington University said. ``Because now
I didn't have to answer the question anymore. I just like things to
be clear-cut. I don't like things to be cloudy. I want to know my
role.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't get him wrong, Kitna wants to be the starter. But he also
realizes his time is coming, while Moon's time is now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to see him out there. It will be exciting for him,''
Kitna said. ``With the team we have this year, that's how they put
it together, with the idea Warren would be in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Hurt feelings? Hardly. Kitna was more concerned Thursday because
it was his fourth wedding anniversary and his wife, Jennifer, was
in Bothell while he was in Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great opportunity for me to show what I could do. It
was something I didn't expect,'' Kitna said of being No. 1 for a
couple of weeks. ``It's good for me. It's good for the
organization. It makes us a stronger team.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, this remains Moon's team. He was welcomed back by being
called out at the end of pre-practice stretching to lead the
traditional jumping jacks to a chorus of hoots from the other
players. He then stayed after practice for more than an hour to
sign autographs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Warren is the leader of our offense,'' coach Dennis Erickson
said. ``He held out, now he's back and our players are excited
about having him back. It's not that he has to apologize or worry
about being accepted. He was accepted as soon as he walked onto the
field.''

NBA PLAYERS WITHDRAW CHARGE OF UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Faced with the failure of their litigation
initiative, National Basketball Association players withdrew their
unfair labor practice charge Thursday and prepared to fight the
league's lockout on the arbitration front.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the players union said they decided to drop their
effort through the National Labor Relations Board because they were
not going to get action quickly enough, but it was apparent that
the board's New York office had concluded there was no merit, at
least not now, in the union's charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a decision that we were not going to get anything to
happen soon enough to suit ourselves,'' Jeffrey Kessler, one of the
union lawyers, said, explaining the union's decision. ``The NLRB
was always considered a long shot, and we concluded it wasn't worth
the effort or our resources to pursue it.''
</P>
<P>
   Russ Granik, the league's deputy commissioner and chief
negotiator, noted that when the union announced that it had filed
an unfair labor practice charge last month, it did not indicate
that the action was not important.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad it's now confirmed that we have a perfectly lawful
lockout,'' Granik said, adding: ``We're not jumping up and down
because this doesn't get a deal. We'll only get a deal when we sit
down and negotiate some more.''
</P>
<P>
   In filing the charge, the union contended that the lockout was
illegal because the players were not working and had nothing to be
locked out from. Furthermore, the union said, by placing a freeze
on the signing of free agents, the league was unilaterally changing
working conditions when the two sides had not bargained to impasse.
</P>
<P>
   The union wanted the board to seek an injunction in federal
court that would serve to end the lockout, just as a
board-generated injunction sent the baseball players back to work
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Circumstances in the two disputes, however, were different. The
board acted on behalf of the baseball players because it felt the
owners had made unilateral changes in the method of negotiating
individual contracts, centralizing signings in the Player Relations
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   In the NBA case, the owners are not changing anything
unilaterally but rather suspending the period in which free agents
can be signed. So the board was not prepared to seek an injunction
or even issue a complaint against the league. Union lawyers
presumably learned of that position and decided to withdraw the
charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't affect the players' determination,'' Kessler said.
``Now we're focused on the Feerick arbitration about player
contracts. Our position hasn't changed at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Kessler referred to John D. Feerick, the arbitrator, and the
hearing he has scheduled for Aug. 24 on the union's grievance
contending that players with guaranteed contracts should have to be
paid regardless of the lockout.

DODGERS BEAT MARLINS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Dodgers had one last chance to redeem
themselves against the worst team in the National League before
taking on the best.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of their series opener against the mighty Atlanta
Braves, the Dodgers finally defeated the lowly Florida Marlins 5-4
in front of 34,804 at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   After back-to-back demoralizing losses, the struggling Dodgers
finally looked like a team worthy of your playoff consideration.
Granted it was against the Marlins, who have not swept a season
series all year. But at this point the Dodgers aren't good enough
to be picky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bottom line, it's a win,'' said weary Dodgers manager Glenn
Hoffman. ``It wasn't easy, but with what's been happening and what
is coming up, it was something we really needed.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory, which moved the Dodgers within five games of idle
Chicago for the wild-card spot, came after the news that struggling
left-fielder Bobby Bonilla will be benched until further notice.
Not only was Bonilla missing, but so were the boos that have been
following him around the entire homestand.
</P>
<P>
   For a change, fans had a chance to cheer. Rookie third baseman
Adrian Beltre blew the game open with a fourth-inning, two-run
homer. Starter Brian Bohanon (6-7), the only Dodgers starter not to
struggle recently, allowed just two runs in eight innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bohanon pitched well,'' Marlins' manager Jim Leyland said.
``He's the perfect example of a lefty who moves the ball around and
changes speeds. He kept us off balance all night. He had a great
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Beltre also helped Bohanon by starting two double plays after
the Marlins got runners on to open the second and eighth innings.
</P>
<P>
   Bohanon then gave way to closer Jeff Shaw, who allowed two hits
in the ninth but held on to record his 35th save and 12th as a
Dodger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt good all night and could have pitched the ninth,'' said
Bohanon, who had allowed just five earned runs in his last five
starts. ``But Jeff hadn't pitched in four days and he needed to get
some work.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Dodgers, the only downside came in the fifth when Raul
Mondesi fouled a pitch off his left shin and was forced to leave a
half inning later. Mondesi, who went 0 for 3 and is 3 for 19 on the
homestand, was taken to Centinela Hospital Medical Center in
Inglewood for precautionary X-rays. They were negative and he is
listed as day-to-day.
</P>
<P>
   The news on Gary Sheffield was much better. After suffering his
first slump since joining the Dodgers in mid-May, Sheffield snapped
an 0-for-18 slide with an eighth-inning single and then recorded
his 18th stolen base.
</P>
<P>
   The stolen base might have been as important as the single. The
Dodgers played passively during the previous eight games when they
went 2-6 against sub-.500 opponents. In the first inning, Eric
Young opened with a single and No.2 hitter Mark Grudzielanek
immediately tried to move him over with a hit-and run play.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't work, but the Dodgers kept the pressure on when Young
stole his 35th base of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike first two games of the series, the Dodgers were the
aggressors from the outset. They scored three runs in the second
off Marlins' rookie right-hander Brian Meadows (9-9).
</P>
<P>
   The first sign the inning would be a little different was the
infield single to short by slow-footed Eric Karros. After a base
hit by Matt Luke put runners at first and second, Karros scored on
a sharp single to left by Charles Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   With Beltre at the plate, Luke scored on a wild pitch. Beltre
then walked and moved to second on a sacrifice by Bohanon. Young,
who had four hits and two two-out RBI Wednesday night, did it
again, singling to left to score Beltre.
</P>
<P>
   Beltre, who only has shown glimpses of his projected talent,
will not be affected much by the benching of Bonilla. Beltre might
be occasionally be replaced by Bonilla at third, but the job is
still his.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just looking for a good pitch,'' Beltre said of his home
run. ``It was a changeup and I went after it.''

HUSKIES MIGHT PLAY YOUNG RUNNERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BUD WITHERS  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ A funny thing happened this week when freshmen
reported for early football drills at the University of Washington.
The Huskies introduced five rookie running backs and _ get this _
hinted some of them might play this year.
</P>
<P>
   Wait until Don James hears about this. He's off in South Bend,
Ind., getting inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame this
weekend. The ex-Husky coach's career was built partly on the idea
that once you signed kids to letters of intent, usually you had no
reason to know their names until they were sometime past the legal
drinking age.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never even talked about it,'' UW coach Jim Lambright said
with a laugh. ``It was, `You guys are going to be redshirted, let's
get on to the guys who are going to play.'''
</P>
<P>
   But the last vestige of James' days as UW coach was the Pac-10
probation that rocked the program in 1993. Five years later, as a
result of two recruiting classes trimmed to 15 scholarships
allowed, Lambright's program still chafes from the manacles:
Fourth-year juniors and fifth-year seniors from the 1994 and '95
recruiting classes number only 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in such a huge need for running backs,'' Lambright said.
``This is exactly what we need, a big line of running backs.''
</P>
<P>
   If junior Maurice Shaw returns healthy from spring back surgery,
he is the likely incumbent to the Napoleon Kaufman-Corey
Dillon-Rashaan Shehee succession of recent years. Junior Jason
Harris hasn't shown he can stay healthy, and redshirt freshman
Jabari Johnson is unproven as well.
</P>
<P>
   Ergo, the welcome mat for five guys, all of whom are 18. The
thinking entering camp is that the two with the best chance of
pushing for significant playing time are Willie Hurst and Jelani
Harrison. But Thursday, Lambright was singing the praises of
6-foot-1, 200-pound Braxton Cleman.
</P>
<P>
   Hurst and Harrison are from south-central Los Angeles. Cleman is
from the harsh streets of Oroville, where he played Class B-11
football.
</P>
<P>
   ``You talk about an athlete from a small school, and you wonder
how he's going to fit in,'' Lambright said. ``Boy, he's really
smooth. He's really doing a good job.''
</P>
<P>
   Hurst is 5-10 and 200 pounds and was described earlier this year
by UW recruiting coordinator Dick Baird as ``a linebacker's
nightmare.'' One Pac-10 coach questioned whether Hurst has the
speed to get to the perimeter consistently, but he conceded Hurst
is a serious inside runner.
</P>
<P>
   Speed is unquestioned with Harrison, a sprinter who says he ran
the 100 meters in 10.4 in track this year after posting a 10.53 as
a junior.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison broke a lot of hearts in Pullman last winter, including
Washington State coach Mike Price's, when he pulled out of a
commitment to the Cougars to sign with Washington. Price, who
already had snagged JC catch Kevin Brown, had hoped he could 1-2
the Huskies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I committed to them in January before I took my trip here,''
Harrison said. ``The environment ... there's really nothing out
there. I think I could maintain here better than out there. I'm
from the city.''
</P>
<P>
   Hurst picked Washington over Arizona and Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coaches stayed true to me,'' Hurst said. ``The Oregon
coaches, they tried to, like, hide people they were recruiting.
Arizona, they tried to paint me this perfect picture of their
place, and it was totally different once I took my trip. They told
me the team acted a certain way, and when I got there, they were
actually totally different.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrison hopes to run track here once he establishes his
football, but Hurst likely won't swing to his second sport. Hurst
was the starting point guard on a Dominguez High basketball team
that spent last season in the nation's top 25, led by USC's touted
football recruit, 6-4 Jason Thomas, and 6-8 Kentucky basketball
signee Tayshaun Prince.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison, Hurst and Clemans are joined by two other candidates:
5-11, 195-pound Matthias Wilson of Ferndale, who broke the state
high school season rushing record with 2,648 yards; and 5-10,
185-pound Andrae Perry of Fontana, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   All of them are bucking some significant history. There isn't a
lot of tradition of Husky tailbacks bursting out as true freshmen.
</P>
<P>
   Kaufman, the UW career rushing leader, had 307 yards for the
1991 national champions, playing behind Beno Bryant and Jay Barry.
Greg Lewis, No. 3 on the career list, was fifth among Husky rushers
in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Jacque Robinson was MVP of the 1982 Rose Bowl with 142 yards,
but he didn't start the game, or any other in his freshman year.
Joe Steele, No. 2 behind Kaufman on the Husky career list, had 421
yards in 1976, third on a 5-6 team.
</P>
<P>
   Among Kaufman, Lewis, Robinson and Steele, there were but three
starts as freshmen, all due to injury. Without knowing any of this,
Harrison and Hurst are properly deferential.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've just got to come in and compete,'' Hurst says. ``The
opportunity is there. We can't just say right off the bat we're
going to start. That'd be a bald-faced lie. Once the vets come in,
we'll go from there.''

SURPRISE: MARINER STAFF ERA APPROACHING RESPECTABILITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM STREET  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Mariner pitching coach Stan Williams laughed Thursday
when recalling his first meeting with the M's pitching staff. He
had told them they could finish the season with a composite earned
run average under four runs a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``They must have thought I was an alien,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners were the laughingstock among major league pitching
staffs, especially the bullpen, which regularly blew leads and cost
former pitching coach Nardi Contreras his job. But since May 1, the
staff ERA is 4.48, slightly above average in the offensive-minded
American League.
</P>
<P>
   The slow and meticulous climb to respectability has reached the
point where bad performances, like those Tuesday night and
Wednesday afternoon in Toronto, are considered a glitch instead of
a trend. Seventh-inning collapses in both games led to back-to-back
losses.
</P>
<P>
   As the M's continue their nine-game road trip Friday night at
Comiskey Park against the Chicago White Sox, the team ERA is 4.76 _
nearly two runs a game lower than when Williams took over April 13.
It's the eighth-lowest in the 14-team AL.
</P>
<P>
   ``ERA-wise, we are where we thought this staff would be when the
season started,'' manager Lou Piniella said Thursday. ``We didn't
think we would be in the top three, but figured we would be
respectable.''
</P>
<P>
   While a sub-4.00 ERA might appear unreachable with only 43 games
left, Williams believes it can be achieved.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been improvement,'' he said, ``but there still is
room for improvement. Everyone has brought their ERAs down a couple
of notches and can go even lower. I'm still planning to get under
4.00.''
</P>
<P>
   There are several reasons for the ERA decline. The biggest
factor, Piniella and Williams say, is better control.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been throwing more strikes, cutting down on our
walks,'' Piniella said. ``(Williams) has done a good job of getting
the pitchers to believe in themselves and trust their ability.''
</P>
<P>
   Mariner pitchers issued 111 walks in 2381/3 innings during
April, when they had an AL-worst 5.59 ERA, and have improved every
month since _ 93 walks in 2451/3 innings in May (4.92 ERA); 74 in
2411/3 innings in June (4.92 ERA); 72 in 231 innings in July (3.86
ERA) and 30 in 88 innings in August (3.99 ERA).
</P>
<P>
   Seattle has climbed from 14th in walks allowed to fifth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate walks,'' Williams said. ``I had a lot of them early in
my career, and I knew that if I could improve my control, so could
they.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams is more laid back than Contreras, and the approach has
been a key factor in the turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it helps to have a goofy pitching coach,'' Williams
said. ``I like to have fun and am a little off-the-wall for a
purpose. The more relaxed I can get these guys, the better job
they're going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Toronto debacles notwithstanding, there has been noticeable
improvement in Seattle's overall pitching.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a big mystery,'' said reliever Mike Timlin, who leads
the staff with a 2.87 ERA and has settled into the closer role.
``Stan has gotten everyone to relax, go at the hitters and throw
strikes. It's pretty simple, really. As the old `KISS' theory goes,
keep it simple, stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   Throw strikes and let the hitters put the ball in play.
</P>
<P>
   It took some pitchers longer than others to catch on:
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)Heathcliff Slocumb was among the most undependable
pitchers on the staff. But in his past 20 appearances, the
right-handed setup reliever has a 2.16 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)Until a giving up a two-run double and grand slam against
Toronto on Wednesday, left-handed reliever Greg McCarthy provided
the type of specialty relief Tony Fossas didn't, holding
left-handed hitters to a .053 (1-for-19) batting average.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)Long reliever Bob Wells, a right-hander, has been solid
while limiting right-handers to a .168 (17-for-101) average.

BUZZ BUILDING FOR LONGACRES MILE

<P>
   AUBURN, Wash. _ The defending champion of the Northwest's
biggest horse race is a temperamental fellow. Kid Katabatic has
been known to pitch a fit, kick and bite according to his
high-strung desire.
</P>
<P>
   So it is best to admire the talented thoroughbred from a few
feet away at his barn stall at Emerald Down.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the stall, the dark-eyed Kid just flicks his strong neck
and gives a sideways glance at the stranger admiring him. It's like
a warning, as if the Kid is daring you to go ahead and treat him
like some ordinary barnyard animal.
</P>
<P>
   (begin italics) ``I'm the Longacres winner,'' (end italics) the
5-year-old Kid Katabatic seems to sneer. (begin italics) ``That's
who you're looking at.'' (end italics)
</P>
<P>
   The big dude, about 16 hands high, has made his unspoken, equine
point.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's always looking to get into something,'' said Shauna Van
Ootsdam, one of Kid Katabatic's owners and his loyal trainer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trick is to get him to the race in one piece. He's funny
that way. He sees other horses moving through the barn and he gets
tense and freezes up. It's just his way of saying he wants to be
working, too. But he has matured so much,'' Van Ootsdam said.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Kid Katabatic won the 62nd running of the Grade III
Longacres Mile _ the state's most historic horse race and also its
biggest.
</P>
<P>
   The Kid took on the favored shipper from California _ Hesabull,
who went off at 1-6 odds. Kid Katabatic won by two full lengths,
setting a course record.
</P>
<P>
   Now Van Ootsdam would like her prize to do it again. On Aug. 23,
the Kid will get his chance to defend his title.
</P>
<P>
   It would be a great accomplishment for Kid Katabatic _ a horse
who possesses all the natural killer instinct of a winner.
</P>
<P>
   It also would be a great story for Emerald Downs, which would
most appreciate a local equine hero to help promote the excitement
and colorful atmosphere of a day at the races. With a guaranteed
purse of $200,000, the Longacres Mile is the only graded stakes
race run in the state, which means it is the single-most important
foothold Washington has into the national racing scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the premiere race in the state,'' said trainer Terri
Forster, whose colt, You've Got Action, is another Mile favorite.
``Certainly, if you figure there are 1,200 to 1,500 horses being
trained here and the field is somewhere between six and 12 horses
and yours is one of them, then you're one of the elite horses.''
</P>
<P>
   Elite for Washington is not necessarily elite by national
standards.
</P>
<P>
   While New York is running its history-rich and purses-fat meet
at Saratoga this August, and as the Southern California circuit
keeps up its daily dose of high-stakes racing, Emerald Downs is
diligently trying to restore thoroughbred racing to the health and
well-being it deserves.
</P>
<P>
   It is clear the Auburn track still feels the effects of
Longacres' closure and the four years of dark days that followed.
The thoroughbred ranks were depleted during that time. Breeders got
out of the business. The number and quality of Washington horses
dwindled.
</P>
<P>
   But in its third season now, Emerald Downs is seeing a comeback.
The track's betting handle has increased ever since the state voted
to allow simulcasting. And with increased handles, purses have
increased as much as 47 percent this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more money that goes to the horses, the better the horses
you attract,'' Forster said, explaining the simple cycle on which
the entire industry depends.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why there is a certain buzz around the barns at Emerald
Downs this week. Elite horses like Kid Katabatic and You've Got
Action are being prepared for the big day _ Mile day.
</P>
<P>
   ``They build the race up quite a bit,'' Forster said,
anticipating the news about which horses will be shipped up from
California for the Longacres Mile.
</P>
<P>
   Mud Route, said to be one of the top horses in country right
now, is on the list of potential entries. Also, acclaimed trainer
Bob Baffert might ship Anet, a seven-time winner whose earnings
over the past two seasons exceed $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes it tougher to win when the stakes horses from
California come up, especially since we like to see the Northwest
horses do well,'' Forster said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this is the only graded stakes race (here), and in order
to keep its status, you need to have those better horses shipped
in. It's the way to improve the racing,'' Forster said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, a wild-eyed horse named Kid Katabatic is making
things interesting in his barn, kicking and causing a fuss.
</P>
<P>
   And two barns over, You've Got Action seems to be enjoying his
daily walks, workouts, ice packs and the special liniments rubbed
into his delicate legs. The gentle but all-business-on-the-track
horse can be found standing in a bed of soft straw, getting the
royal treatment and waiting for the big day.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are really like any athlete,'' Forster said. ``They are
very well pampered.''
</P>
<P>
   And very well worth the visit.

ONCE AGAIN, THE CUP IS BIGGER FOR WOODS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDMOND, Wash. _ He never used his powerful driver, his ball
striking was not up to par, and yet Tiger Woods ended Thursday
leading the PGA Championship.
</P>
<P>
   Call it talent. Call it maturity. Call it versatility. Call it
very impressive. Shooting a 4-under-par 66, and setting a course
record while smartly winding his way between the monstrous trees at
Sahalee Country Club, Woods held a two-stroke lead over a large
group.
</P>
<P>
   It was an uplifting day for Woods, the world's No. 1-ranked
player, whose red-hot putter turned what could have been an average
round into a superb one. Woods made five putts of 15 feet or longer
_ the most confident he has looked with his putter in a major
tournament since the 1997 Masters, when he rolled to a
record-setting 12-stroke victory.
</P>
<P>
   And by electing to keep his driver in the bag, and relying
primarily on his 2-iron and 3-wood for tee shots, Woods both
avoided the danger of Sahalee's trees and gave an early indication
that he feels comfortable and confident enough to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my length is definitely a huge advantage on this
course,'' said Woods, whose 66 broke the previous course record of
67, by Jack Nicklaus during an exhibition in 1984. ``I'm able to
hit 2-irons and 3-woods where guys are having to hit driver. I'm
able to carry the ball out there and land it softer, because I
don't have a club that's really hot like a driver, landing on the
ground and running into the rough.''
</P>
<P>
   While Woods held the lead, the tightly-bunched leader board held
intriguing possibilities for the weekend. The tie for second place
included Paul Azinger, the 1993 PGA champion; Craig Stadler, the
1982 Masters champion, and Glen Day, Bob Estes, Bill Glasson, Frank
Lickliter and Shigeki Maruyama.
</P>
<P>
   Mark O'Meara, trying to become the first man since Ben Hogan in
1953 to win three majors in the same year, shot a solid 69, leaving
him just three strokes off the lead. O'Meara, who was 2 over par
through six holes, showed his resiliency by shooting 3 under par
over the next 12 holes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept myself in the ball game,'' said O'Meara, who came from
behind to win both the Masters and the British Open. ``I think it's
exciting. I have nothing lose.''
</P>
<P>
   But to win, O'Meara will have to catch Woods, a close friend and
neighbor. Woods has been using O'Meara's backup putter for the past
month, or as Woods put it, ``The one I stole.''
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't O'Meara know that neighbors who borrow things often
don't return them?
</P>
<P>
   Woods set the tone for the day by making an 18-footer on No. 3
to save par, but he was just getting started. He made a 15-footer
for birdie at No. 5, an 18-footer for birdie at No. 7, an 18-footer
for birdie at No. 13 and a brilliant 35-foot downhill putt for
birdie on No. 17. And for the first time this year, he has the
feeling golfers dream about, when every putt looks easy to read and
when the cup seems just a little bigger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel so much more comfortable over the ball,'' Woods said.
``I can't really explain why. Anyone who plays this game knows
putting comes in cycles. You have to ride it when you have highs
and try to get over slumps as quick as possible.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As for slumps, Woods has found himself defending his performance
this year, despite nine top 10 finishes, a victory in the Bell
South Classic, a victory in the Johnnie Walker Classic in Thailand,
and a third-place finish in the British Open.
</P>
<P>
   For most players, that would be an impressive season. So while
Woods admits he would love to have more victories this year,
Thursday's patient performance was another example of the progress
he has made since last year, when he finished tied for 19th at the
PGA Championship at Winged Foot Golf Club in Mamaroneck, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a more mature Tiger than you saw last year at this
time,'' Woods said of himself. ``I've got more shots. I understand
my game. I understand how to hit shots when I'm not really feeling
well over the ball, how to keep it in play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned that I need to work on my wedge play, because last
year, I felt so uneasy about my wedge play, I didn't feel like
laying up after hitting a bad shot. People saw me be very
aggressive trying to get the ball close to the green. Yeah, because
I probably had a better chance of making par from there than I
would from 100 yards. I've been working on my wedge play all year,
and I'm feeling good. Now, you can pitch out and save pars that
way. That's the name of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   While most players found the back nine tougher than the front,
Woods shot 34 on the front, and 32 on the back. Meanwhile, others
who threatened to end the day with at last a share of the lead had
difficulty on the final holes.
</P>
<P>
   Glen Day reached the 15th green at 5 under par with a one-stroke
lead over Woods, who was already in the clubhouse. But Day made his
first blunder of the day, three-putting from 6 feet for a double
bogey that dropped him out of first place.
</P>
<P>
   After Day's 6-foot attempt for par lipped out of the left side
of the hole, he hit a poor bogey putt from 3 feet that never
touched the cup. Day gave the hole an icy stare, knowing he had
just lost the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it was fitting that someone named Woods would be the leader
on a course with so many trees. With 54 holes left to play, a lot
could happen, and will happen. But Woods will begin the second
round in an enviable position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been close to putting it together, being in the hunt
where I could legitimately win,'' Woods said. ``It's about getting
the right breaks at the right time. I'm very pleased the way I've
played in the majors. Even though I haven't won, I've given
everything I've got. Winning this week would definitely be nice.''
</P>
<P>
   CHIP SHOTS:
</P>
<P>
   Three prominent players struggled to 76s: David Duval, Lee
Janzen and Payne Stewart. ... John Daly tripled-bogeyed No. 18 and
shot an 80. Fred Couples, a local favorite who grew up in nearby
Seattle, struggled to a 74.

RED SOX HAVE LAST WORD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ They hit plenty. Ran a little, too.
</P>
<P>
   But pitching? Not even an honorable mention.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox banged out their 70th win of the season Thursday
night, an 8-7 endurance test against the Twins at Fenway Park, with
the help of 16 hits, a couple of defensive gems, and even _ brace
yourself down there on the beach on Block Island _ a couple of
timely stolen bases.
</P>
<P>
   For a team in pursuit of a wild-card bid, it doesn't get much
wilder than Thursday night at the Fens, where the clubs combined
for 28 hits, 11 pitchers, and 10 extra-base hits, including Nomar
Garciaparra's game-winning double in the seventh inning that
brought Mo Vaughn lumbering around with the 15th and final run.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll blow some teams out,'' said Sox catcher Scott Hatteberg,
who contributed three hits to the assault and flashed the signals
for no fewer than a half-dozen hurlers. ``And we'll be in some
tight games, too. Winning the tight ones like this is key during
the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Early on, Thursday night's game appeared to be a Sox blowout in
the making. A three-run fourth inning, spiced by Garciaparra's
line-drive homer into the screen and a Darren Bragg squeeze bunt
that brought in Mike Stanley soon after a stolen base, put the Sox
in command, 4-0. A little more than an hour had passed in what
would become a 3-hour 26-minute crawl before a crowd of 32,801.
</P>
<P>
   The truth was, the game had just begun. The Twins halved the
lead in the fifth after starter Pedro Martinez opened the inning by
fanning Todd Walker and getting Terry Steinbach on a fly to right.
Back-to-back singles by David Ortiz and Pat Meares, followed by an
Otis Nixon walk, set the stage for Brent Gates to lash a two-run
single to center. Sox, 4-2.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez struggled into the seventh and finally staggered to the
showers, his final line bloated: 6 1/3 innings, 10 hits, 6 runs,
all earned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't feel in a groove,'' said Martinez after logging his
first no-decision since May 14. ``I didn't feel I had it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatteberg felt Martinez was only slightly off his game, missing
marginally with some good pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``But sometimes it's not there,'' said Hatteberg. ``It's never a
velocity thing with Pedro. His velocity is always there. And he's
such a finesse pitcher, he can get by without his best stuff. But
sometimes ... sometimes it's just not as easy as riding a bike.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox reasserted themselves in their half of the fifth, adding
three runs on four hits _ including doubles by John Valentin and
Vaughn and singles by Garciaparra and Stanley. Just before
Stanley's shot to left, Garciaparra moved to second on the Sox'
second stolen base of the evening (call Tommy Harper and give him
the news). When Garciaparra crossed the plate, the Sox were in
front by five runs, 7-2.
</P>
<P>
   But the Twins kept bashing, too. They trimmed the lead by a pair
in the sixth when Ortiz delivered a two-run double, then tied it in
the seventh when they chased Martinez. A Gates double followed by a
Paul Molitor single sent Martinez to the showers. After Greg
Swindell gave up an infield single, Dennis Eckersley was rocked for
a Marty Cordova two-run double. It was tied, 7-7, and the Eck
eventually picked up the win despite getting torched. That's
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn and Garciaparra, a combined 6 for 9 on the night with
three doubles, a homer, and four RBIs, rattled Travis Miller for
the winning run in the seventh. Vaughn launched a leadoff double to
center, and Garciaparra matched it, drilling a shot high off the
Wall in left-center. It was the star shortstop's 95th RBI of the
year, leaving him only three shy of his 1997 total.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Gordon made it stand up with a perfect ninth for his 33d
save.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wouldn't think so, with (Brad) Radke and Martinez
pitching,'' said Sox manager Jimy Williams, alluding to how wide
open the night became despite the presence of the two aces. ``But
that's the nature of the sport.''

ISAAC STOKES, 91, LAWYER DURING NEW DEAL AND AT U.N. BIRTH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.H., Vt., Mass., Conn., Md.)  (lh) 
 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Isaac Stokes, a lawyer who worked on New Deal legislation
regulating securities brokerage firms and also helped in the
creation of the United Nations and the rebuilding of Europe after
World War II, died Aug. 4 at a retirement home in Hanover, N.H., a
son, Thomas, said. He was 91.
</P>
<P>
   In 1934, Stokes was among many bright young men drawn to
Washington by James Landis, one of his Harvard Law School
professors, to draft what became the Securities and Exchange Act of
1934, the basic statute governing Wall Street. The young lawyers
and students often slept on cots as they drew up the regulatory
blueprint, and some of them, including Stokes, became lawyers for
the new Securities and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   In 1936 he returned to New York to practice law at the firm now
known as Debevoise &AMP; Plimpton. But his work for the federal
government would continue. He returned to Washington during the war
years, drafting rules for the War Production Board and focusing on
the promotion of plain English instead of the stilted language
common to regulations.
</P>
<P>
   In 1946, Alger Hiss hired Stokes for the staff of the U.S.
delegation to the United Nations, where he worked to secure the
choice of New York City as the headquarters site and to devise the
terms of diplomatic immunity for representatives of other
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Theodore Kheel, the New York labor lawyer and a neighbor of
Stokes when he lived in the Riverdale section of the Bronx, N.Y.,
said that specifying that Hiss had once been a patron was
illustrative of Stokes' character. Hiss was sentenced to prison for
perjury in a 1950 espionage case in which, he insisted he had been
framed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had courage, and he did not want to hide anything, did not
get embarrassed by a fact that others might have tried to hide,
like his being hired by Alger Hiss,'' who, Kheel said, ``was a
respected man then.''
</P>
<P>
   Stokes next worked in the State Department under George Kennan
on the policy planning staff. President Truman appointed him chief
counsel of the Commerce Department in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   The following year, he went to Paris as general counsel of the
Mutual Security Agency _ the Marshall Plan. He later became deputy
director of the organization, which helped revive European
economies from the destructiveness of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to New York in 1953 and became a founding partner of
the Fleischmann Stokes &AMP; Hitchcock law firm, which had a clientele
of multinational corporations. The firm was later folded into
another firm and then dissolved. He retired in 1972 and moved to
Jericho, Vt., where he continued to practice law part-time and
served on two Vermont commissions concerned with land use and water
pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Stokes came from a family long active in social causes and
public service. His great-aunt, Caroline Phelps Stokes, was the
founder of the Phelps-Stokes Fund in 1911 to help educate blacks
and American Indians and to help residents of New York City
tenements.
</P>
<P>
   Stokes became a trustee of the fund in 1937 and served as
chairman from 1963 until he retired in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Isaac Newton Phelps Stokes graduated from Yale in 1929 and from
Harvard Law School in 1933.
</P>
<P>
   His first wife, Barbara Hoyt Stokes, died in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his second wife, Katrina Roelker Huntington
Stokes; three sons, Samuel, of Silver Spring, Md., Thomas, of
Stockbridge, Mass., and Mitchell, of Newton, Mass,; two daughters,
Janet, of Boston, and Olivia Stokes Drier of Belchertown, Mass.;
three stepdaughters, Lydia Sparrow of Brunswick, Maine, Madge
Cooper of New York and Mary Silloway of Mendon, Vt., and five
grandchildren.

MICHAEL PALM, 47, INNOVATOR IN METHOD OF REINSURANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Colo., Pa., Conn.)  (lh) 
 By JOSEPH B. TREASTER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Michael D. Palm, a former English teacher who made a fortune in
reinsurance _ the business of sharing the risk of insurance
companies _ and then contributed millions to benefit the arts, gay
rights and AIDS treatment, died Aug. 7 at his home in Telluride,
Colo. He was 47 and also had homes in New York City and St. Croix
in the Virgin Islands.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was heart failure caused by complications
from AIDS, according to his sister, Melissa Jamula of Reading, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Steven Gluckstern, a former colleague at an
English-language school in Tehran, Iran, Palm founded Center Re, a
Bermuda reinsurance company, in 1988. Centre Re specialized in a
then relatively little-used kind of coverage that specifically
limited the losses the reinsurer could suffer and rewarded
customers with rebates on premiums for keeping claims down.
</P>
<P>
   The approach, known as finite risk and now often used as a tool
in both reinsurance and primary insurance, lowered the cost of
protection for customers and eliminated the rare, but very real,
possibility of a reinsurance company's being wiped out by an
avalanche of claims.
</P>
<P>
   While the method Palm helped popularize can be profitable, it is
not a factor in most reinsurance, partly because calculating limits
of coverage and rebate levels is difficult and because an
overweening goal of many primary insurers is virtually unlimited
protection against huge losses. Also, many reinsurers prefer the
higher premiums that come their way in exchange for fuller
protection.
</P>
<P>
   One of the initial backers of Centre Re, now called Centre
Solutions, was the Zurich Insurance Group. The Zurich group bought
the entire company in 1993 and kept the founders as the chief
executives. Palm retired as vice chairman at the turn of the year,
saying he wanted to devote himself to philanthropy and more reading
and thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Palm, whose father was a policeman and later a city councilman
in Reading, graduated from Yale University and earned a master's
degree from Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   After working together in Tehran, Palm and Gluckstern initially
followed different paths in finance. But they were reunited when
Gluckstern was hired by Warren Buffett to run a reinsurance unit of
Berkshire Hathaway and Gluckstern invited Palm to join him. Buffet
did not share their enthusiasm for finite risk, so the two friends
struck out on their own. Their creation now has assets of more than
$9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Palm set up the Michael Palm Foundation in New York in 1995 with
an endowment of $10 million. The next year, the foundation gave
$2.5 million to the Gay Men's Health Crisis, the nation's largest
provider of AIDS services, to help build a $12 million headquarters
in New York. The foundation also pledged $1 million each to the Gay
and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation and the Human Rights
Campaign, the nation's largest gay political organization. It
pledged $1 million to Yale the next year.
</P>
<P>
   Palm, who kept two pianos _ a Baldwin and an antique Steinway _
in his penthouse apartment overlooking Lincoln Center and loved to
romp through classical pieces and popular songs from the 1930s and
1940s, also contributed to the Metropolitan Opera and Carnegie Hall
as well as the opera in Telluride.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his sister, Palm is survived by his mother, Irma,
of Reading.

SERENA GOOD ENOUGH
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Though it appears that two Williams sisters, Venus and Serena,
are on the Corel WTA tour, there actually are three sisters ---
Venus, Good Serena and Bad Serena.
</P>
<P>
   Good Serena Williams showed up Thursday in the Acura Classic at
Manhattan Country Club and beat seventh-seeded Sandrine Testud,
6-4, 3-6, 6-1. The match could have been a sign that Serena
Williams' split personality, or inconsistency, is gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bad Serena has been eradicated,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Signs of Bad Serena showed up in the second set, when Williams
trailed, 4-1. But she fought back and did not go lightly. Testud
had 13 set points before she finally won the second set.
</P>
<P>
   Next, Williams takes on top-ranked and top-seeded Martina Hingis
this afternoon in the quarterfinals. Williams, ranked 21st, is in
her first tournament in six weeks and appears stronger and steadier
than when she played last. So does she have a shot at winning?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think so,'' Williams said. ``It depends on which Serena
shows up.''
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen-ranked Testud thinks so, too. ``She thinks she can beat
anyone, so it makes it even harder to beat her,'' Testud said.
</P>
<P>
   Seles comes back in second set
</P>
<P>
   Fourth-seeded Monica Seles advanced to the semifinals by beating
fifth-seeded Nathalie Tauziat, 6-4, 6-4, in one hour and four
minutes. Seles trailed, 4-1, in the second set, but rattled off
five straight games to win.
</P>
<P>
   Seles now is 9-0 against Tauziat in her career. In the
semifinals, she will face the winner of tonight's 7 p.m. match
between second-seeded Lindsay Davenport and eighth-seeded Natasha
Zvereva.
</P>
<P>
   Lucky loser wins again
</P>
<P>
   Elena Tatarkova, who earned a spot in the tournament when Mary
Pierce withdrew, advanced to the quarterfinals with a win over
sixth-seeded Irina Spirlea, 6-2, 6-2. Tatarkova, ranked 63rd, will
face third-seeded Arantxa Sanchez Vicario in the quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   Two teams in semifinals
</P>
<P>
   Two doubles teams, Hingis with Natasha Zvereva and Chanda Rubin
with Irina Spirlea have advanced to the semifinals. Two
quarterfinal matches will be played today.

MINIMALIST RITCHIE IS THE MOST
</HEADLINE>
   By TIM KEOWN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
For those of you who like your symbolism delivered with the
delicacy and precision of a sledgehammer, we present the issue of
Jon Ritchie's wardrobe.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Metaphorically freeing himself of worldly concerns, Ritchie
arrived at his first NFL training camp with only the clothes on his
back _ a T-shirt, khaki carpenter's pants and a pair of leather
sandals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I normally try to keep my mind free for other things,''
Ritchie says.
</P>
<P>
   His planned asceticism turned into a biblical dilemma after
roughly two weeks, however. Word percolated through Napa's seamy
underside that Ritchie's clothes would be rendered unwearable by
some of the Raiders' veterans if they didn't see a change.
</P>
<P>
   One man's asceticism, apparently, is another man's lack of
hygiene.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rumors abounded,'' Ritchie says. ``Some of the veterans were
going to take action, and that first outfit is very dear to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Ritchie splurged on another pair of carpenter's pants (olive
this time) and another T-shirt. Monastic, sure, but with just
enough options to keep them guessing.
</P>
<P>
   Ritchie's mind, we are to assume, remains mostly uncorrupted by
the exponential increase in material possessions. There might have
been a minor adjustment, because he says you have to think fast in
order to play fast, and too many choices can slow the process. You
start picking through the closet in the morning and before long
you're standing paralyzed in the buffet line, unable to choose
between white and whole wheat.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is unique to me _ there's a lot I have to learn,'' he
says. ``I have to pick up the offense and work on technique. I want
to immerse myself in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a rookie, your role is to keep your mouth shut. You do what
the coaches tell you, you listen and keep yourself open-minded. You
need to be willing to give of yourself and not start things up.''
</P>
<P>
   Ritchie is the Raiders' starting fullback, a statement that
means more than it did a year ago. Before, being the Raiders'
starting fullback was a lot like being in charge of setting up Al
Davis' media interviews: There might be a job there, but the
workload is pretty light.
</P>
<P>
   Ritchie delivers every line with the same deadpan, heavy-lidded
demeanor. He plays guitar and saxophone, writes his own music and
lyrics, assiduously avoids combing his hair. He's cool because he
is trying so hard to be the antithesis of cool.
</P>
<P>
   He listens to bands like Creed and Days of the New. He has
always been in awe of Hendrix and Morrison. He has a scraggly Gen-X
beard and his hair sticks up and out in every direction, almost
magically. This hair, much shorter than his days at Stanford, kicks
gravity's sorry butt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have some cowlick problems,'' he says, his tone taking on
the staged seriousness of a mock psychiatric evaluation.
</P>
<P>
   Ritchie was in a band once; he played with The Briefs during his
two years at Michigan. Now he writes songs in his spare time (one
rule: no odes to football, ever).
</P>
<P>
   His most recent composition begins:
</P>
<P>
   (ital) You're so enticing as you smile &QC; 
and muddy me &QC; 
piercing my dark, dirty despair &QC; 
(end ital)
</P>
<P>
   The Raiders _ muddied like few before them _ care only that
Ritchie weighs 250 pounds and moves them fast enough to stay in
front of Napoleon Kaufman. The evolution in the Raiders' offense
makes the fullback a viable pass-catching option; when they opted
against re-upping the Joe Bugel offense _ a system established just
weeks after men began walking upright _ the Raiders sent out a call
for a productive fullback.
</P>
<P>
   And anyone who remembers Tom Rathman swinging out to the right
with half a field in front of him will know what Ritchie is hoping
to see.
</P>
<P>
   Later in his most recent composition, Ritchie sings:
</P>
<P>
   (ital)
</P>
<P>
   I'm stuck in my fantasy &QC; 
I'm lost in my fantasy &QC; 
in gleeful hope and hopeful glee &QC; 
But what's destiny besides a prayer &QC; 
for what can never be? &QC; 
(unital)
</P>
<P>
   Ritchie's bohemianism may make him an unlikely football player,
but his lineage is straight from a B movie. He grew up in a central
Pennsylvania town where every kid's dream was to play football for
Cumberland Valley High School. As Ritchie describes it, ``If, for
genetic reasons, you couldn't play football, then you were forced
to play another sport.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, Jon's a little different,'' says Raiders running backs
coach Skip Peete. ``But his work ethic is great. He comes from a
part of the country where you're taught to grab your lunch pail and
go to work all day till the work's all done. That's the way he
approaches his job.''
</P>
<P>
   In the real world, Ritchie wouldn't be all that different. There
are thousands just like him walking the streets of the Bay Area,
ducking in and out of used-record shops and coffee houses, coming
to terms with their dark dirty despair.
</P>
<P>
   But in football, which is not the real world, Ritchie is quite a
bit different. That's why he keeps his mouth shut, his mind clear
and his options few. For now, anyway.

<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; PASADENA--One minute Carlos Hermosillo's eyes were rolling with
relief--the next minute, he was pumping his fists to the crowd
after scoring the fastest consecutive goals in MLS history, only 64
seconds apart in the 76th and 78th minutes.
</P>
<P>
   His two goals helped lead the Galaxy to a playoff clinching 3-0
victory over Kansas City, in front of 10,200 at the Rose Bowl
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Hermosillo, all but tar and feathered for going his first 10
games without scoring a goal after coming to L.A. heralded as
Mexico's all-time leading scorer, certainly looked like a player
whose career was starting over again.
</P>
<P>
   His two goals added more significance, because his first goal
put L.A. in a tie with D.C. United for the most goals in the
regular season, and his second, the 71st of the season for the
Galaxy, established the MLS team scoring record.
</P>
<P>
   The victory clinched Los Angeles' third consecutive playoff
berth in as many seasons and they are now just a couple victories
shy of nailing down their second Western Conference regular season
title in three years.
</P>
<P>
   Still, all the talk centered around Hermosillo, who was given a
good luck stone by the Galaxy's fan club (the Galaxians) a day
earlier. Hermosillo walked into the presroom sporting a bright
yellow Galaxian shirt afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``These fans have always supported me from the first day I
walked on the turf, Hermosillo said. ``This one was for them. I
consider myself a Galaxian.
</P>
<P>
   Someone asked if Hermosillo had ever gone this long without
scoring a goal before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not even in my dreams, he said. ``When you don't score goals
and you have a lot of opportunities you begin to doubt yourself. I
started to doubt myself just a little bit but thanks to my
teammates and the fans who never lost support in me I began to come
through.
</P>
<P>
   Following his first goal, Hermosillo put his finger in front of
his mouth, a message he said, to quiet his critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been a lot of people over time who have been
talking about me, Hermosillo said. ``I was just telling them to be
quiet and have some patience. The second goal was more for the
people who have supported me since I've come here.
</P>
<P>
   Galaxy coach Octavio Zambrano, not particularly pleased with the
overall flow of the game, was glad Hermosillo put those goals
behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously I'm glad he finally got that off his mind, Zambrano
said. ``Anytime a goal scorer breaks out of a slump, that's reason
to be happy.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy's league leading mark improved to 19-6 (55 points)
with six games remaining. Second place Chicago (13-10, 37 points)
now trails L.A. by 18 points, with nine games left on its schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City, who was swept in all four meetings with L.A. this
season, dropped to 10-12.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles, who had its problems creating chances throughout
the game, particularly in the first half, saw defender Robin Fraser
at one point make a 70-yard run that almost resulted in a goal.
</P>
<P>
   Fraser's run probably sparked the Galaxy offense, because the
league's top scoring machine surprised Kansas City in the 32nd
minute to take a 1-0 lead, thanks to a tremendous burst of speed
from Cobi Jones.
</P>
<P>
   At the bottom of the center-circle in the Galaxy's own half of
the field, midfielder Martin Machon dropped a 35-yard pass over
three Kansas City defenders who turned to scramble for the ball,
but Jones simply sprinted past them, leaving himself one-one-one
with Wizard goalkeeper Mike Ammann. The K.C. keeper hurried out to
challege Jones, but the Galaxy midfielder easily beat him to the
right side for his 13th goal of the season.

ON BASEBALL: WITH EYE ON OCTOBER, NELSON WATCH STARTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Open the door to the Yankee clubhouse and watch the
premier team in baseball preparing for another game in routine
fashion. Orlando Hernandez is stretching by his locker on the left
side, Paul O'Neill is trying on batting gloves at the far end of
the room and Tino Martinez is swinging new bats in the right
corner. The scene is businesslike and blase.
</P>
<P>
   But take one step to the right after entering and there is a
scene that is unsettling to a team pursuing destiny and greatness.
That is where Jeff Nelson is sitting, hoping that the bulging disk
in his lower back does not plague him when he stands up or bends
over and especially when he throws off a mound Friday for the first
time in almost two months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just get up every day and hope the stiffness I feel goes
away,'' Nelson said Thursday. ``I don't think about the possibility
of missing any more of this. It's been tough missing the last two
months. Even if I did come back and feel something, I would try to
hide it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson is so desperate to return to the Yankees and be an
important part of this magical year that he admitted he might not
disclose the truth about his back injury, which could have been
tough talk or silly talk. If Nelson really intends to be deceitful,
that would be a thornier problem for the Yankees and a poor career
decision by the 31-year-old reliever.
</P>
<P>
   When Nelson was asked about concealing information from the
Yankees, he said: ``Probably, especially if it's going good now. If
I don't feel anything, I'm not going to say anything. If I feel
something and I'm helping, I'm not going to say anything.''
</P>
<P>
   It is nearly impossible to find fault with a team that is on
pace to set a major-league record for regular-season victories, a
marvelous team that had Manager Johnny Oates of Texas admitting it
was natural for the Rangers to feel intimidated Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Still, when the Yankees peek ahead to the postseason and analyze
how they can be most impenetrable, Nelson must be an influential
part of the equation. The bulging disk was causing pain to shoot
down Nelson's legs, which is why the Yankees have proceeded
cautiously with his rehabilitation and have targeted his return for
Sept. 1, and why they are seriously considering obtaining another
right-hander, like San Diego's Brian Boehringer or Jim Bruske.
</P>
<P>
   Another right-hander would provide insurance, but neither
Boehringer, a former Yankee, nor Bruske, who is pitching at Class
AAA Las Vegas, is Nelson. Although Nelson has a 5-3 record with an
ordinary 4.54 earned run average and has permitted a .291 average
to right-handed batters this season, his sidearm motion and wicked
slider helped him limit right-handers to a .168 mark last season
and to .245 when the Yankees won the 1996 World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Fast-forward to October. If Joe Torre needs a reliever to retire
Juan Gonzalez or Nomar Garciaparra or Manny Ramirez in the eighth
inning, he had better be able to call on Nelson. Ramiro Mendoza is
valuable and Hernandez might be effective in the setup role, but
Torre needs Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go into postseason play, you have to win right now,''
Torre said. ``There's no such thing as tomorrow. You might find
yourself making changes quicker than in the season. The more
choices you have, the better-armed you are.''
</P>
<P>
   David Cone, David Wells, Andy Pettitte, Hideki Irabu and
Hernandez have given the Yankees such consistency in the rotation
that Nelson joked, ``They're doing so good, they don't miss
anyone.'' But the games seem a lot shorter in October, and the
bullpen is usually busier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything changes once September hits,'' said Nelson, who
will travel to Tampa, Fla., on Sunday and should pitch in
minor-league games within 10 days. ``Our starters have been
outstanding, but things change in the playoffs. It's a different
situation because you're not going to leave your starters in there
as long.''
</P>
<P>
   Does Nelson think he will make it back and be effective?
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope I can come back,'' he said. ``You always have some kind
of twitch, and you always have a sense it's going to come back.
That's the biggest fear. I do feel better.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill said: ``If you put yourself in a playoff atmosphere and
you've got a right-handed hitter coming up, there's not anyone in
the world you'd rather have face him than Nellie. He's nasty.''

WOODS OPENS WITH COURSE-RECORD 66 FOR PGA LEAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RALEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDMOND, Wash. _ Tiger Mountain sits 10 miles south of Sahalee
Country Club, but Thursday there was another Tiger towering above
the trees.
</P>
<P>
   The guy with all the shots and fans, Tiger Woods, found himself
a few floors above the rest of the neighborhood, emerging as the
first-round leader of the 80th PGA Championship. He carded a
4-under-par 66, good for a two-stroke advantage over eight players
and a course record.
</P>
<P>
   His Stripeness never pulled his driver out of the bag. But for
4{ hours, he was everything his legions of admirers have come to
expect.
</P>
<P>
   Overpowering. Magical. Unwavering.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a more mature Tiger than you saw last year at this
time,'' said Woods, pursuing his second major and eighth PGA Tour
victory. ``I've got more shots.''
</P>
<P>
   While Woods, the 1997 Masters champion, had his way with the
6,906-yard layout, Sahalee stood up well in its first test against
the tour. Just 20 of the 150 players broke par, including Mark
O'Meara, bidding for a record-tying third major victory this
season.
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara, one of 11 players who shot 69, bogeyed two of his first
three holes. But the 41-year-old rebounded nicely, making no more
mistakes _ just like he did on his way to victories this year in
the Masters and British Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept myself in the ballgame,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sahalee wasn't the Olympic Club, the San Francisco course that
humbled the best during the U.S. Open in June. But it wasn't
Interbay Family Center, either.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the game's biggest names simply crumbled in the face of
100-foot trees and 4-inch rough. Five players shot 80 or higher,
including 1991 PGA champion and former British Open winner John
Daly. Reigning U.S. Open champ Lee Janzen, Open runner-up Payne
Stewart and tour money leader David Duval each fired 76 and entered
the clubhouse 6 over par.
</P>
<P>
   The normally steady Duval mangled the par-4 10th hole. He dumped
shots in a lake and a bunker, and then three-putted for
triple-bogey 7. Two holes later, he found another bunker, hit a
tree and chipped one out after landing a foot from a chain-link
fence, finishing with a double-bogey 6 on the 12th hole.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Duval warned against using the driver on the Redmond
course.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can get away with it for awhile,'' he said, ``but it's
gonna get you in the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods' club of choice was his putter. Turning in a seven-birdie,
three-bogey round, he dropped six putts from 15 feet or more.
Actually, the club wasn't his; it was O'Meara's backup, borrowed
for several weeks from his good friend.
</P>
<P>
   Woods thought about using his driver just once, on the par-4
seventh hole. The temptation wasn't great enough. He settled on a
2-iron on the 421-yard hole _ and carded a birdie.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a big donut today,'' Woods said of his driver use.
</P>
<P>
   Golf's prodigy was sluggish at the start, bogeying the first
hole. His tee shot found the rough; his approach missed the green.
</P>
<P>
   Two shots into the second hole, a 507-yard par-5, Woods got
everything going. He was 220 yards from the green when he leaned
into a 3-wood and sent his ball sizzling toward a lake bordering
the right side of the green. He groaned. But it carried over the
water by two feet and rolled 10 feet from the cup. He birdied.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the whole round was probably made on No. 2,'' Woods
said. ``Snuck out with one there.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods' card showed a bogey on the sixth hole. Witnesses,
however, saw Woods do something otherworldly there. On the 480-yard
par 4, he put his tee shot into a fairway bunker. He muscled his
next shot 230 yards, over trees and onto a green that wouldn't hold
it, the ball finding a back bunker. But the sheer magic of that
2-iron had eyes hanging out.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has an incredible ability to recover,'' playing partner
Nick Price said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I absolutely flushed it,'' Woods said, noting that he hit the
shot perfectly. ``It was just one of those things where I hit too
good a shot.''
</P>
<P>
   He birdied three of four par-3s, draining a 35-footer on the
last one, the 215-yard 17th.
</P>
<P>
   Even without his driver, Woods was a monster off the tee. On the
18th, he hit a 3-wood shot 305 yards to the middle of the fairway,
with the crowd roar lasting longer than the air time. Price and
Jeff Sluman were more than 50 yards back on their efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my length is definitely a huge advantage on this golf
course because I'm able to hit 2-irons and 3-woods where guys are
sometimes having to hit drivers,'' Woods said.
</P>
<P>
   His 66 was one better than Sahalee's course record, set 14 years
ago by Jack Nicklaus in a charity exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expected him to play well,'' O'Meara said. ``This is a good
course for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Two shots back were Billy Andrade, Paul Azinger, Glen Day, Bob
Estes, Bill Glasson, Scott Gump, Frank Lickliter and Shigeki
Maruyama. Not exactly a threatening group. Collectively, they have
one major victory among them, Azinger's PGA Championship in 1993,
and he hasn't won since, with health setbacks getting in the way.
</P>
<P>
   Andrade and Day each birdied their first four holes, but
couldn't maintain the perfect pace. Andrade, the last alternate
added to the field, fell back with a double bogey on the sixth
hole.
</P>
<P>
   Day, still looking for his first tour victory, was 5-under
through 14 holes _ the only golfer to go that low _ but he
double-bogeyed the 15th and bogeyed the 17th.
</P>
<P>
   Which leaves Woods, pining for a second major, in a choice
position. Still, Woods has never won a tournament after leading
following the first round.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just trying to give myself a chance,'' he said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   At least he has 149 guys looking up at him.

TYSON'S BID TO RETURN IS SHIFTED TO NEVADA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Nev.)  (lh) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One day before the New Jersey State Athletic Control Board was
to make a decision on his application for a boxing license, Mike
Tyson, the former world heavyweight champion, withdrew the
application and instead applied to Nevada _ the state that revoked
his license last year after he bit Evander Holyfield's ears during
a championship bout.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson's withdrawal came in the wake of some strong statements by
New Jersey political figures, who contended that Tyson should not
be given a license. One of those who spoke up was state Sen.
William Gormley, a Republican who is chairman of the Senate's
Judiciary Committee and is the brother of Gerard Gormley, who is
the chairman of the state Athletic Control Board. In addition,
Tyson's initial decision to sidestep Nevada drew a scathing rebuke
from U.S. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who has been calling for
reforms in boxing and who led passage of the Professional Boxing
Safety Act in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sen. John McCain has been a real good friend of boxing in
Washington, D.C.,'' said Jeff Wald, the Hollywood entertainment
executive who has been advising Tyson. ``He came out this week and
said he was dismayed that Mike Tyson was going around the law he
had written. We have enough respect for Senator McCain not to do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the legislation that McCain helped enact calls for
states to recognize suspensions that are handed down in other
states. Because Nevada revoked Tyson's license and did not suspend
it, Tyson and his lawyers were exploiting a loophole in the federal
law by going through New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Wald said he, Tyson's attorneys and Shelly Finkel, who is
another of Tyson's advisers, decided it was better to stick with
the spirit of the law. They formally withdrew the application
Thursday afternoon. Almost immediately, they applied to Nevada for
a hearing to get Tyson his license back there, according to Marc
Ratner, head of the Nevada State Athletic Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Ratner said it will take 14 to 21 days before Tyson will be
granted a hearing, because the commission will have to find a
suitable venue to hold the hearing and because he wants to make
sure that all five of the commissioners will be available.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that was the proper thing to do,'' Jim Nave, one of
the five members of the Nevada State Athletic Commission told The
Las Vegas Journal Review Thursday, regarding Tyson's decision to
ask Nevada for his license back. ``They should have applied here in
the first place. We're the ones who revoked his license, and we
should decide if he gets it back.''
</P>
<P>
   When Nevada revoked Tyson's license in a hearing in July 1997,
Tyson was not present. During his hearing for a New Jersey license
on July 29, Tyson was the model of civility as several character
witnesses spoke before the panel over the course of three and a
half hours. But following a 45-minute questioning by Michael Haas,
an assistant attorney general for New Jersey, Tyson became angry,
and in remarks to the panel he uttered an expletive. The outburst
might have hurt his chances to get a license in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Wald said he and other Tyson advisers did not get a sense that
Tyson would have been rejected by New Jersey if they had proceeded
with the application. However, Wald acknowledged he was taken aback
by the comments by Gormley, who said granting Tyson a license would
be bad for the state of New Jersey and bad for boxing, because
Gormley is the brother of Gerald Gormley.
</P>
<P>
   ``That took away any semblance of impartiality,'' Wald said. He
also said that Tyson is in full agreement with the decision to
withdraw his application in New Jersey and apply in Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   Wald added: ``I don't think you'll find five points have been
taken away from Mike Tyson in the ring in his career. He's not a
dirty fighter. What happened with Holyfield was a total
aberration.''

DODGERS BEAT MARLINS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
FIXES SCORE 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Dodgers had one last chance to redeem
themselves against the worst team in the National League before
taking on the best.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of their series opener against the mighty Atlanta
Braves, the Dodgers finally defeated the lowly Florida Marlins 5-2
in front of 34,804 at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   After back-to-back demoralizing losses, the struggling Dodgers
finally looked like a team worthy of your playoff consideration.
Granted it was against the Marlins, who have not swept a season
series all year. But at this point the Dodgers aren't good enough
to be picky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bottom line, it's a win,'' said weary Dodgers manager Glenn
Hoffman. ``It wasn't easy, but with what's been happening and what
is coming up, it was something we really needed.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory, which moved the Dodgers within five games of idle
Chicago for the wild-card spot, came after the news that struggling
left-fielder Bobby Bonilla will be benched until further notice.
Not only was Bonilla missing, but so were the boos that have been
following him around the entire homestand.
</P>
<P>
   For a change, fans had a chance to cheer. Rookie third baseman
Adrian Beltre blew the game open with a fourth-inning, two-run
homer. Starter Brian Bohanon (6-7), the only Dodgers starter not to
struggle recently, allowed just two runs in eight innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bohanon pitched well,'' Marlins' manager Jim Leyland said.
``He's the perfect example of a lefty who moves the ball around and
changes speeds. He kept us off balance all night. He had a great
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Beltre also helped Bohanon by starting two double plays after
the Marlins got runners on to open the second and eighth innings.
</P>
<P>
   Bohanon then gave way to closer Jeff Shaw, who allowed two hits
in the ninth but held on to record his 35th save and 12th as a
Dodger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt good all night and could have pitched the ninth,'' said
Bohanon, who had allowed just five earned runs in his last five
starts. ``But Jeff hadn't pitched in four days and he needed to get
some work.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Dodgers, the only downside came in the fifth when Raul
Mondesi fouled a pitch off his left shin and was forced to leave a
half inning later. Mondesi, who went 0 for 3 and is 3 for 19 on the
homestand, was taken to Centinela Hospital Medical Center in
Inglewood for precautionary X-rays. They were negative and he is
listed as day-to-day.
</P>
<P>
   The news on Gary Sheffield was much better. After suffering his
first slump since joining the Dodgers in mid-May, Sheffield snapped
an 0-for-18 slide with an eighth-inning single and then recorded
his 18th stolen base.
</P>
<P>
   The stolen base might have been as important as the single. The
Dodgers played passively during the previous eight games when they
went 2-6 against sub-.500 opponents. In the first inning, Eric
Young opened with a single and No.2 hitter Mark Grudzielanek
immediately tried to move him over with a hit-and run play.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't work, but the Dodgers kept the pressure on when Young
stole his 35th base of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike first two games of the series, the Dodgers were the
aggressors from the outset. They scored three runs in the second
off Marlins' rookie right-hander Brian Meadows (9-9).
</P>
<P>
   The first sign the inning would be a little different was the
infield single to short by slow-footed Eric Karros. After a base
hit by Matt Luke put runners at first and second, Karros scored on
a sharp single to left by Charles Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   With Beltre at the plate, Luke scored on a wild pitch. Beltre
then walked and moved to second on a sacrifice by Bohanon. Young,
who had four hits and two two-out RBI Wednesday night, did it
again, singling to left to score Beltre.
</P>
<P>
   Beltre, who only has shown glimpses of his projected talent,
will not be affected much by the benching of Bonilla. Beltre might
be occasionally be replaced by Bonilla at third, but the job is
still his.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just looking for a good pitch,'' Beltre said of his home
run. ``It was a changeup and I went after it.''

DALY GOES LONG, THRILLS FANS ... AND ENDS WITH 80 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDMOND, Wash. _ So different was John Daly's game Thursday from
anyone else at Sahalee _ hey, from anyone else's on the planet _
that he nearly rendered it unscoreable.
</P>
<P>
   Daly's drives were so far ahead of playing partners Al Geiberger
and Wayne Grady that the volunteer scorekeeper assigned to the
threesome nearly lost track of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell if he's hitting again,'' said a worried Linda
Strum, straining to see around the dogleg for Daly while standing a
hundred yards back with the drives of his partners. ``This is kind
of hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Hard on everybody, including Daly. He shot 80.
</P>
<P>
   The 1991 PGA champion blew himself out of the 1998 championship.
Fulfilling his promise of the day before when he vowed to play his
motto, ``grip it and rip it,'' Daly attacked the course with his
driver.
</P>
<P>
   At least six tee shots went beyond 300 yards, including the
386-yard No. 4, in which he swallowed 322 yards with his first
swing. But as far as catching up with this course, he may as well
have tried to run down a rabbit with a dump truck.
</P>
<P>
   The worst came at 18. The expectation was that Daly would be
stripping bark from the trees with his drives.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he found himself virtually beneath the bumper of
KING-TV's satellite truck, which was parked on a hilltop near
buildings a good 25 yards from the fairway.
</P>
<P>
   Had KING's Danger Jim Forman only known, he could have leaped
from the truck for a quote from the ball.
</P>
<P>
   The placement was actually a drop for Daly, whose tee shot
snap-hooked into a hillside forest so deep that the ball was found
next to a dead elf. Daly took a penalty stroke just to get a lie
visible to the fairway, then scuffed one into the rough. His next
shot gained him maybe a hundred yards.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he missed a 10-foot putt on the final green for a
quadruple-bogey seven, the mercurial Daly was expected to launch
his putter through the sliding glass doors of a course-side home.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he calmly signed his card, calmly walked past waiting
reporters, and calmly drifted into the warm night, leaving others
to explain his day.
</P>
<P>
   ``He started to lose it toward the end,'' Geiberger said. ``He
was going for it on just about every hole. Eventually it grabs you
somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Urged on at nearly every drivable hole by legions of
thrill-seekers waiting to be taken to the frontier of golf, Daly
cranked the club so far, and whipped it through so fast, it seemed
possible to detect a slight vapor trail.
</P>
<P>
   At 60 with 22 years on the PGA Tour, Geiberger figures he had
seen just about everything in golf. Thursday was a new experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were cheering like crazy and they have no clue,'' the
1966 PGA winner said. ``They're just waiting for the big shot. It
would be very hard (for him) because of their expectations. It's a
lot to live up to.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is Daly himself who has created the standard, because he
loves to indulge himself and the crowds with his prodigiousness off
the tee. Of course, as perhaps sports' best-known recovering
alcoholic, indulgence has always been an issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``He plays a reckless game, just lets it go,'' Geiberger said.
``Crowds love it. I felt like a peashooter out there. I felt like I
was in the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Geiberger was smiling when he said it, because he shot an 81.
Grady grinned through his recollections, too, because his 76 meant
``the way I'm playing, I can't get upset at anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it does get a little over the top out there sometimes. If
I was playing well, I might have gotten a bit distracted.''
</P>
<P>
   Grady, an Australian who won the 1990 PGA, the year before
Daly's first win in a major, also knows that the public affection
for Daly goes beyond his howitzer work in the tee box.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el.5l &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people have a feel for what he's gone through over the
last couple of years,'' he said. ``I imagine that's a lot of it.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el.5l &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Daly's sobriety, now in its 17th month, is obviously a far
greater achievement than anything he can produce on a golf course.
But perhaps it is Daly's former reputation as a party hound that
helps bring out the wolf howls in a sport that accepts no betrayal
of civility.
</P>
<P>
   ``The unfortunate thing about some fans is they scream just to
listen to themselves scream,'' Grady said. ``As soon as the club
head hits the ball, it's like, `Did you hear me scream?'''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el.5l &LR;
</P>
<P>
   When the screams die away, Daly usually finds himself on the
green, where his putter has for months been dead in his hands. That
held true Thursday, when he was unable to compensate for his
wayward driving with a single birdie.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had big hitters in the past who've won on narrow
courses, but that's because they go to the 2-iron all day,''
Geiberger said. ``John doesn't want to play that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Daly is an ice cream truck coming down a neighborhood street,
bells tinkling. Kids flock and giggle, but what is delivered lately
is sweetness, not substance.

HOMECOMING TURNS FRUSTRATING FOR COUPLES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDMOND, Wash. _ It was a rough day that just seemed to get
rougher after an all-too-brief but heartfelt send-off for the
hometown favorite Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best part of Fred Couples' opening round 4-over-par
74 at the PGA Championship was walking off the first tee and
hearing hundreds of fans encouraging him to ``Rip it up Freddy.''
</P>
<P>
   Couples is used to hearing encouraging words, but they made him
feel all the more discouraged because of his performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're walking along and people are screaming, `Have a
good round,' or `Go get 'em,' that's pretty normal,'' Couples said.
``Just because I come from here ... it's on the first hole, it's on
the second hole, all the way to the 18th.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I was pretty much making them subdued the way I was
playing. There wasn't a whole lot to scream and yell about.''
</P>
<P>
   When Couples started straying, it was the 4- to 6-inch rough
that penalized him time and again. He likened it to the rough at
the U.S. Open at San Francisco's Olympic Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a demanding course from the fairways, and when you're in
the rough, you can't really get it to the greens,'' he said. ``The
rough is all gnarly and matted down.''
</P>
<P>
   Couples started out looking like he would navigate the tight
course without too much trouble, with a par on the 406-yard par-4
first hole. He followed that by sinking a 12-foot putt on No. 2 for
a birdie. But then his 3-wood started to draw to the left and he
began missing fairways, hitting into the tangled tall grass.
</P>
<P>
   He blew a chip shot from the fringe at No. 7 and made bogey,
lipped a sand shot from one fairway bunker into another on No. 8
and made bogey, and then ended the round with a disastrous double
bogey at 18 after hitting a perfect 3-wood 233 yards in the middle
of the fairway off the tee.
</P>
<P>
   After the round, Couples admitted he kept having different swing
thoughts all day and that none of them seemed to take root in his
brain. He felt like he was scrambling and struggling just to make
pars when they came and he had only three birdie chances all day,
converting the one on No. 2 and on the 215-yard par-3 17th.
</P>
<P>
   He also wasn't spurred on by the group he was playing with.
Spaniard Jose-Maria Olazabal shot a 5-over 75 and Englishman Lee
Westwood limped like Couples with a 74.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes players can feed off each other if they starting
hitting good shots, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our whole group was pretty mediocre and we just got in each
other's way,'' Couples said. ``I couldn't get any help from them
and I certainly didn't give them any. I was just trying to make
pars.''
</P>
<P>
   But Couples had no excuses, saying his oft-strained back was not
a problem and that he didn't even mind playing in the hot afternoon
sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look back on the last two tournaments I've had (a tie
for 53rd at the U.S. Open and a tie for 66th at the British Open),
I've done nothing to turn that around, and that's disappointing,''
Couples said. ``But it's a hard course.''
</P>
<P>
   The worst feeling, he said, was finishing No. 18 with a double
bogey after his birdie at No. 17. He hit his second shot at 18, a
4-iron, into the handicapped-access area in the left grandstand.
After taking a drop, he then chipped 30 feet below the hole and
three-putted.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I would have made par there, then 72 would have been a
decent score for the way I played,'' Couples said. ``But 74 for the
way I played, I can always say that's about what I deserved. ... It
was a sour finish to a pretty mediocre round.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though he was unhappy with his play, Couples did say he
``had fun'' playing in a major tournament in front of fans who grew
up with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a few good pars, but it was pretty mediocre stuff,''
Couples said. ``It's very difficult when you are not doing anything
very well and people are on you're side. That's just a bonus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't help you hit a 3-wood down the fairway or a 7-iron
on the green, but it's still nice to know that they are yelling for
you. ... Coming from Seattle, that's nice. Now all I have to do is
go out there and play better.''
</P>
<P>
   Couples no longer even thinks about winning, going into Friday's
round, in which he has a 7:43 a.m. tee time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to really play some good golf just to get back into
position to be close to the lead. I think I'm quite a ways from
there,'' he said. ``I'd like to play a good round (Friday) and then
Saturday and Sunday so I can look like I know what I'm doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Couples may have had trouble with his swing thoughts Thursday,
but he's trying not to think the unconscionable: that he might not
even be around to play the final two rounds in his hometown.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an old cliche that tomorrow is another day. But if I
don't play better, I'll have my work cut out for me just to make
the cut,'' Couples said.

WHEN TIGER PLAYS, IT'S A SPECTACLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ELLIS E. CONKLIN  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A warm wash of applause splashed down on Tiger Woods on Thursday
as he stepped to the first tee at 8:19 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Woods made no eye contact with the crowd, and unlike Nick Price,
who is a big-league hat-tipper, Tiger tipped his white cap ever so
slightly. There was no wild cheering. No one screamed out his name.
No Tiger pandemonium erupted as it does at his increasingly rare
autograph sessions. Just respect, admiration, appreciation.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger is the main attraction at Sahalee. He is the reason
Michael Landers of North Seattle rousted his two little boys at
dawn in order to get to the course on time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tiger is the guy you want to see. What he does out there is
beyond amazing,'' Landers said.
</P>
<P>
   With a 2-iron, Woods' first shot crackled down the fairway but
found the right rough. Groans echoed through the woods. Then he
hacked into more ankle-deep rough near the green. The crowd,
pressed against the ropes and straining to see, was silent.
</P>
<P>
   Head forward, Woods marched briskly down the fairway. ``He's
quite a fast walker,'' one woman observed.
</P>
<P>
   Woods two-putted the first hole and ended with a bogey. More
groans.
</P>
<P>
   All along the way, thousands of spectators positioned themselves
just for the chance to see him walk by. Many followed him for the
entire 18 holes. This is life in Tiger Land.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's so awfully cute,'' said Sally Weiner, a 29-year-old
cocktail waitress in Everett. ``My son has his whole room done up
with Tiger posters.''
</P>
<P>
   All day, a sporadic chorus of ``Go get 'em Tiger,'' and ``Nail
it, baby,'' serenaded Woods as he blasted his way through Sahalee's
tight fairways.
</P>
<P>
   When Woods cracked a drive down the fairway on No. 2, a man
cried out, ``He is a god, isn't he?''
</P>
<P>
   As Woods set up to putt on the No. 3 green, his flamboyant
Deadhead-loving caddie, named Fluff, smoked a Marlboro. Fluff, with
his white walrus mustache, also gets a lot of attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's kind of a scruffy guy, isn't he?'' a woman muttered to
her husband.
</P>
<P>
   Woods owned the crowd _ and, as it later turned out, the course
as well _ after draining a 10-foot putt on the third for a birdie.
From then on, the crowd yelled ``Get in! Get in!'' on every putt.
</P>
<P>
   Everywhere, people began to shout his name as Woods passed them
by, the conquering hero moving from to shot, always shadowed by a
platoon of reporters and a couple of security guards.
</P>
<P>
   Does he notice the attention? Does he hear his fans bellowing
``awesome,'' and ``amazing,'' and `wow'' at every drive? Did he see
7-year-old Cole Adams telling him, ``Good shot, Tiger,'' on the
17th hole?
</P>
<P>
   ``He's young and he's good _ and he's animated. That's what I
like about him,'' said Don Ball, who lives in Sahalee.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger is indeed animated on the course. He'll pump his fists in
a moment of jubilation, and angrily throw a tee away the next as he
did on the sixth hole when his drive took a detour into a right
sand trap.
</P>
<P>
   By the 15th hole, it seemed as though all of Sahalee was
following Woods. This would have been the hole at which to see the
master at work. His first shot sliced right and lay wedged deep
into the rough.
</P>
<P>
   But then Woods pulled out a 9-iron and to launch a screaming
75-yard line drive that landed within six feet of the cup.
</P>
<P>
   As Marilyn Monroe once said to Joe DiMaggio, ``Joe, you have
never heard such cheering.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Awesome touch,'' one fan cried out.
</P>
<P>
   At the 18th hole, thousands in the steamy hot grandstands roared
their approval as Woods made his way to green.
</P>
<P>
   And at last, Tiger Woods tipped his cap.

REDMOND NATIVE FINDS PGA DREAM OVERWHELMING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM MOORE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Normally on the first tee, you see nervous fidgeting from
anxious players. Thursday, with Byron Nelson and the Wanamaker
Trophy behind him, Scott Williams showed that the emotion of the
situation had finally tracked him down, producing tears.
</P>
<P>
   The eyes welled up when his name was announced: ``From the great
state of Washington, Redmond's own, Scott Williams!''
</P>
<P>
   Before then, even in his practice rounds with Fred Couples, the
local club pro from Glendale had just been enjoying himself,
oblivious to the circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   When it hit him, it was a solid blow. He was the kid who grew up
in Bellevue at Tam O'Shanter, a housing development with a
nine-hole golf course on the west side of Lake Sammamish. He went
to Interlake High School just up Northeast 24th Street.
</P>
<P>
   One of the world's biggest tournaments was being played on a
course that is just three miles from his house in Summer Ridge on
the Sammamish Plateau. His wife and two sons were there, along with
his sister and brother and so many other family members and friends
they could have lined the 11th hole, the longest fairway at
Sahalee. Like one of the fans, Williams got Nelson's autograph and
stood there unprepared for what happened next.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't sense or feel a lot of it (pressure),'' Williams
said. ``But 15 minutes before my tee time, it was really something.
All of a sudden, they call my name and, God, I was nervous. I told
my caddie: `I don't know how I'm going to get this one in the
air.'''
</P>
<P>
   When he did, when the ball found the fairway, Williams threw up
his arms in relief.
</P>
<P>
   For much of the day, he battled Sahalee and lost, shooting an
8-over-par 78, but none of the scars were evident. He beat John
Daly by two shots and is two behind Lee Janzen and David Duval.
</P>
<P>
   His supporters encouraged him, and Williams acknowledged them.
It was an unusual sight. Tournament players typically are zoned in
on their jobs, focused on flagsticks more than fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We (club pros) are in a different mindset than tour players,''
he said. ``For us, it's Christmas. I can still grind it out and say
howdy to people.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd, in fact, helped him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have scored a lot worse if it had just been me out
there,'' Williams said. ``The fan support was frightening. The
atmosphere, the people ... I rode that. I played off it.''
</P>
<P>
   During one nine-hole stretch from the sixth through the 14th,
Williams was even-par, but the rhythm disappeared on the final four
holes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, Scotty, did you go to the right again? I'm going to spank
you,'' said his mom, Barbara Williams, as she watched her son's
drive sail behind two cedar trees at the 18th. ``My heart aches
when he's struggling. I know how good he is. I'm like his son
(Ryan) who thinks he is the best golfer in the world ... I wish I
could magnetize the ball to make it go to the center of the
fairway.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Williams slumped into a chair and took a swig of his
Dr Pepper before getting up to answer questions. He was still
wearing his Lexus hat and Lexus shirt. This wasn't a national deal
like Mark O'Meara has with Toyota. He was sponsored by Lexus of
Bellevue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll go out and just have fun,'' he said about Friday. ``I've
always got to dream and think I can shoot 64.''
</P>
<P>
   If he doesn't and fails to make the cut, Williams understands
the consolation of all this _ the experience of having the
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never had that much fun shooting 78,'' he said.

   REDMOND, Wash. _ Marcy Sjodin doesn't even play golf, much less
watch it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been driving (at a golf range) once in my life,''
admitted the 26-year-old Seattle woman.
</P>
<P>
   But a free ticket to the PGA? She'll take it _ and make the
pilgrimage there just to see the young, the attractive, the
charismatic and talented golf superstar Tiger Woods.
</P>
<P>
   That includes fighting snail's pace traffic on state Route 520,
parking at the far end of a dusty field at Marymoor Park and riding
a shuttle (er, yellow school bus) to the Sahalee course in Redmond.
</P>
<P>
   Sjodin was one of thousands of people who showed up this week to
watch Woods practice for the 80th PGA Championship tournament.
Camera in hand, she trailed him, hoping to get a good photograph.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's exciting,'' she said, craning her neck to see the
22-year-old golf prodigy. ``It's not that much fun to watch on TV.
But here it's different. You're outside on a nice day.''
</P>
<P>
   Tiger. His name was on virtually everyone's lips. Flocks of fans
snapped pictures of him, watched in reverential silence as he swung
and tried, mostly unsuccessfully, to engage him in conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nice one, Tiger!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tiger, can my son have your autograph?''
</P>
<P>
   Woods, they agreed, has helped spark interest in the sport among
a whole new generation that cuts across ethnic lines.
</P>
<P>
   Bon Regala, his brother Jon and friend Rich Aquino also showed
up to watch Woods, who is of mixed descent. They say they play at
least once a week. Young, stylish Filipino-Americans, the trio
represents the new breed of golfers. Aquino wears a small gold
earring.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are playing at a younger age, especially since Tiger
came along,'' said Bon Regala, 24. ``There are more minorities
playing. The stereotype of the upper-class golfer has begun to
decline.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither the National Golf Foundation nor the National Minority
Golf Foundation has done a comprehensive study of minorities in
golf.
</P>
<P>
   But the number of African-American golfers has increased a bit,
the National Golf Foundation says. In 1986, they made up 1.8
percent of all golfers. Last year, they made up 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Women now make up 22 percent of all golfers. Female golfers went
from 4.5 million in 1986 to 5.7 million today _ a 26 percent
increase, according to NGF figures.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Generation X-ers polled recently by the Zandl Group,
a New York City firm that studies young adult market trends,
proclaimed golf the sport that's getting ``cooler'' than any
others, including mountain biking and even snowboarding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, there were more young people as beginners than
there had been in previous years,'' said Judy Thompson, NGF
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Others say the sport _ once the domain of wealthy older males _
has become more affordable.
</P>
<P>
   Using his backpack as a pillow, 58-year-old Bill Crane stretched
out under some trees at Sahalee. He and his son, Dan, 26, play golf
together every chance they get.
</P>
<P>
   ``To go to a Mariners game, by the time you get good seats and
parking, you could play probably two rounds of golf at an
outstanding course for the same price,'' said Crane, of Gig Harbor.
``And I think the young generation is a little more into doing
active things and not just spectator sports.''
</P>
<P>
   At Sahalee's picturesque, tree-lined 15th hole, PGA volunteer
Patty Seaton watched the parade of people following Woods. A
longtime golfer, she too has noticed new faces on the links.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're younger,'' she said. ``More women. Lots of young
people. Probably because of Tiger. I've been standing here on this
hole for three hours. Some of the best players in the world have
been practicing, and nobody came through to watch _ except when
Tiger played.''

   WASHINGTON _ Thursday morning, wearing a dark suit and a grave
expression, President Clinton did what numbers of his predecessors
have been called upon to do: he presided over the bleak ceremonial
that attends the return of Americans killed in service overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Everything was as it should be: the Stars and Stripes at
half-mast, the precision of the military rite; the president and
the first lady. As on each such occasion in the past, Clinton's
words and demeanor were the very model of what Americans expect
from their president.
</P>
<P>
   For a Briton, the uncynical awe in which Americans hold the
president has something innocent and archaic about it, something
perhaps of the way we once regarded the monarch.
</P>
<P>
   Patriotism and national leadership, like religion, are more
intact here in the New World. Ordinary people fly the national flag
in their gardens. They respect the president and the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why the resignation of Richard Nixon, under threat of
impeachment, is widely seen even now not just as comeuppance, but
as a national tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   It is also why the fall of Bill Clinton _ who has never
pretended to perfection _ would be so hard for America to bear.
</P>
<P>
   Cut now to ``that dress.'' Is it really possible that a
president who meets so many of the requirements of his office so
admirably could be brought down by something so tawdry, so
distasteful as a stain on a young woman's dress?
</P>
<P>
   Depending on how Clinton testifies on Monday, it is not only
possible, but _ especially if the stain turns out to be what it is
alleged to be _ inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   Many in Washington, and still more in the country at large,
refuse even to entertain the possibility. They engage in some of
the mental compartmentalizing at which Clinton so excels and say
that ``sex'' is different.
</P>
<P>
   While the president may have ``sinned,'' they say, he has
committed no crime. Lying about sex should not count as perjury.
</P>
<P>
   At the further reaches of that view is the flagrantly primitive
line that the more demonstrably virile the president, the more
respected his leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Of those who would condemn the president, the most timid _ so
far - are the moralists on the political right, for whom unrepented
sin would constitute a bar to the highest office. Such a view might
have disqualified many of the more distinguished American
presidents, but it has a certain consistency.
</P>
<P>
   More vociferous are the legalists who insist that perjury is
perjury, one and indivisible. If the president lied under oath, he
should go.
</P>
<P>
   It is immaterial whether the lie came in a civil suit (as was
the Paula Jones sexual harassment suit), whether it came in
evidence that was judged ``immaterial'' (as was Clinton's in the
Paula Jones case), whether the suit was dismissed (as the Paula
Jones suit was), whether the subject was sex (as it arguably is).
</P>
<P>
   What would happen, ask the legalists, if everyone took the oath
so lightly? The whole foundation of the legal system would founder.
That way lies impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Most compelling, however, as Clinton prepares to become the
first president to testify before a grand jury in defense of his
own conduct, are the constitutionalists.
</P>
<P>
   They argue that whatever happens, whether or not a sin was
committed, whether or not the law was broken, Clinton has
diminished the office of the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Their contention is that, partly through his own fault, partly
not, Clinton bears responsibility before his successors for
curtailing the power of the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The rot set in, they say, with the Supreme Court ruling in the
Paula Jones case last year, that a sitting president could be sued
in a civil case. That one decision, fought by the president's
lawyers to no avail, drove the whole legal juggernaut that has
compelled the president's testimony in the Monica Lewinsky
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   On the way, Clinton's lawyers have fought and lost a succession
of legal contests that define the extent of presidential power _
downwards. What was hitherto ambiguous, and deliberately left that
way by previous presidents, is now marked out.
</P>
<P>
   A president's bodyguards may be required to testify against him
if he is suspected of breaking the law. Lawyers employed by the
White House rather than the president himself owe their first duty
to the taxpayers who technically pay them: their advice to the
president may not be confidential.
</P>
<P>
   A president may be subject to subpoena (compulsory court
summons), and the principle of ``executive privilege,'' which
allows a president's conversations with advisers to remain
confidential, extends no further than the requirements of national
security.
</P>
<P>
   In short, a president who has a state salary, a house of
majestic proportions, a private plane, a staff of hundreds and the
power to blow up the world has no more legal privileges than a
private citizen if he is suspected of breaking the law.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, his position is worse, because political
considerations limit his options further. If, on Monday, he were to
exercise the citizen's right to remain silent rather than
incriminate himself (take the Fifth Amendment), the world would
know, and he would be universally regarded as guilty.
</P>
<P>
   In the past seven months of the Monica Lewinsky saga, Bill
Clinton has tested the limits of the presidency, morally, legally
and constitutionally, and Americans have been generous to a fault.
</P>
<P>
   They like the man; he is charming, engaging, and ``one of
them.'' He retains the aura of office, and they respect that.
</P>
<P>
   Just now, as the hours tick away before Clinton's sworn
testimony on Monday, America seems torn between these two views of
the presidency, and two views of Bill Clinton: is the president
just like them, fallible, forgivable, but subject to the law; or is
he above judgment?
</P>
<P>
   The courts have decreed that the president is a citizen, no more
and no less. Where Clinton is concerned, however, the people so far
think otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   While bosses are summarily dismissed for dalliances with office
juniors, the President of the United States may entertain a young
woman trainee in his office and further her career with impunity.
</P>
<P>
   While officers in the armed forces are liable to discharge for
adultery, the Commander in Chief may pursue a relationship that was
temporarily discouraged by the woman's transfer to _ of all places
_ the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, it seems, can get away with it. Americans are treating
their president as a superior being, a superman, to whom man-made
rules do not apply.
</P>
<P>
   They respect his handling of the office, and he reciprocates, as
he did Thursday, with some fine presidential performances in which
America takes pride.
</P>
<P>
   As long as the popular mood and the state of the law are out of
kilter, Clinton is probably safe. But if public opinion once
catches up with the law, as it could do after Monday, Bill Clinton
will be vulnerable, if not completely done for.
</P>
<P>
   He may not, in the end, have lied under oath or broken the law.
But he has flouted the rules, rules which ordinary Americans are
expected to observe, rules he has publicly embraced.
</P>
<P>
   Were I an American voter and a Clintonite, it is this personal
double standard that would test my loyalty _ not the diminishing of
the presidency or the toying with the law, but the selfsame
question that has dogged Bill Clinton's presidency from the start:
character. &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Thursday morning, wearing a dark suit and a grave
expression, President Clinton did what numbers of his predecessors
have been called upon to do: he presided over the bleak ceremonial
that attends the return of Americans killed in service overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Everything was as it should be: the Stars and Stripes at
half-mast, the precision of the military rite; the president and
the first lady. As on each such occasion in the past, Clinton's
words and demeanor were the very model of what Americans expect
from their president.
</P>
<P>
   For a Briton, the uncynical awe in which Americans hold the
president has something innocent and archaic about it, something
perhaps of the way we once regarded the monarch.
</P>
<P>
   Patriotism and national leadership, like religion, are more

<P>
   EXCLUSIVE-CLINTON-LEWINSKY (Washington) _ President Clinton has
had extensive discussions with his inner circle about a strategy of
acknowledging to a grand jury on Monday that he had intimate sexual
encounters with Monica Lewinsky in the White House, senior advisers
have said.
</P>
<P>
   HEALTHCARE-SUIT (Washington) _ A federal appeals court, in a
nationwide class action, expanded the rights of Medicare patients,
ruling that they are entitled to immediate hearings and other
protections if they are denied care by an HMO. By Robert Pear.
</P>
<P>
   INTERNET-PRIVACY (Washington) _ In the government's first
Internet-privacy enforcement action, the FTC says a popular site on
the World Wide Web run by GeoCities lied about how it would use the
personal information it collected from more than 2 millions
subscribers, both adults and children. By Joel Brinkley.

   WESTERN-LAND-TRUSTS (Clark, Colo.) _ Here and across the
mountain west, tourism and the second-home industry have spurred a
land rush that is carving up the ranch land that composes
heart-stopping Western vistas, threatening the very landscape that
draws so many people to the Rockies. The pressures are so powerful
that they are forging alliances of two longtime adversaries:
cattlemen and environmentalists. By James Brooke. (With photos.)
</P>

   CALIF-FONG (San Francisco) _ Less than three months ago, Matt
Fong was little known outside California, where he is state
treasurer. Now, Republican heavyweights like Newt Gingrich and

</P>
<P>
   WEST-POINT-NOVEL (West Point, N.Y.) _ Lucian Truscott IV's new
novel, ``Full Dress Gray,'' like his 1978 mystery, ``Dress Gray,''
is a steamy potboiler set at the United States Military Academy in
West Point. Surprisingly, the academy has eagerly embraced the
book. ``I thought I would never be welcome up there again,'' says
Truscott, who graduated from the academy in 1969. ``Now they're in
the process of milling a whole new red carpet to run out for me.''

the bomb went off. By Tim Weiner and Raymond Bonner. (With

   AFRICA-MEMORIAL (Andrews Air Force Base, Md.) _ To the strains

   CONGO-REBELS (Kinshasa, Congo) _ Rebels hostile to President
Laurent Kabila apparently knocked out all electrical power to the
capital and tightened their hold on a strategic region outside this
city. By Howard W. French. (With map.)
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-CROQUET (Dalian, China) _ Croquet, or ``gate ball'' as
they call it here, is the game of the moment in China. Among the
elderly, anyhow. In cities throughout northern China, retired and
not-completely-retired people are spending much of their summer
days playing it, and they compete with a ferocity that seems almost
primal. By Seth Faison. (With map and photo.)
</P>
<P>
   YUGO-KOSOVO (Pristina, Yugoslavia) _ In a serious setback for
Western governments hoping to end the war in Kosovo through
negotiations, the ethnic Albanian leader, Ibrahim Rugova, Thursday
named a team to negotiate peace with the Serbs that does not have
the ingredient that diplomats consider essential to success:
representatives of all ethnic Albanian political forces. By Mike
O'Connor. (With map)
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO-BORDER-DEATHS (Los Angeles) _ In an oven-hot patch of
California desert just north of the Mexico border, the bodies of
seven people were found Thursday, apparently the victims of the
heat and their dreams for a better life. By Don Terry. (With map.)

28 cents a share and cuts 14 cents from 1995 profit and 18 cents
from 1996 profit. By Diana B. Henriques.
</P>
<P>
   PEPSI-BOTTLERS (Kinston, N.C.) _ Pepsico's independent bottlers
have been fighting an uphill battle against Coca-Cola Consolidated,
the second-largest Coke bottler in the United States, which can
afford big marketing campaigns and price wars in the fight over
shelf space and vending machines. Now, 12 years after Coke moved to
a centralized ``anchor bottling'' model, Pepsico is considering a
spinoff of its company-owned bottling operations, which might then
acquire independent bottlers _ which are already consolidating. By
Constance L. Hays. (With graphic and photos.)

   JAPAN-CORRUPTION (Undated) _ Earlier this year, it seemed that a
sweeping corruption investigation might send a good number of
Japan's mighty philosopher kings _ the bureaucrats who largely run
the country _ to prison. But these days, despite a Cabinet change,
nearly the only government employee who has gone anywhere is
Katsuhiko Kumazaki, the prosecutor who led a much-heralded
investigation into scandals involving expensive free entertainment
paid for by businessmen who wanted the bureaucrats' favor. By
Sheryl WuDunn.

   RUSSIA-MARKETPLACE (Undated) _ The growing possibility of a
devaluation of the Russian ruble swept the world's markets
Thursday. Although the Russians insist there will not be a
devaluation, the threat has already led to a major selloff in
emerging markets and proved a drag on Wall Street and other major
stock markets. By Jonathan Fuerbringer. (With graphic.)

<P>
   MARKET (New York) _ A growing sense of crisis in the Russian

IN SILICON VALLEY SPEECH, BOXER PATS SELF ON BACK OVER ECONOMY 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN WILDERMUTH  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUNNYVALE, Calif. _ California's economy has been humming along,
and Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer showed Thursday that she is
anxious to take her share of the credit.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the past five years, the United States has enjoyed a
renaissance of peace, prosperity and creativity unmatched in this
century,'' Boxer told a friendly crowd of Silicon Valley business
people Thursday. ``Emerging from the recession of the early 1990s,
we have marched from success to success.''
</P>
<P>
   And one of the keys to that success, the senator suggested, is
the risk she and other Democrats took in supporting President
Clinton's 1993 budget, which passed by a single vote over the angry
opposition of Republicans. That vote was the first step toward this
year's first balanced budget in three decades, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to tell you the vote I cast was a popular one at the
time,'' Boxer said. ``It wasn't. A lot of people lost their
(Senate) seats over that 1993 vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican senators called the budget ``a one-way ticket to a
recession,'' and ``a prescription . . . to put people out of
work,'' but those predictions were wrong, Boxer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We passed the president's first budget, invested in America,
made tough choices, and now our country has the strongest, most
vibrant economy of any in the world today,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the luncheon talk at Amdahl's ``Good Government'' forum
in Sunnyvale was considered a nonpolitical event, there's no such
thing for Boxer, who is locked in a furious re-election struggle
with Republican State Treasurer Matt Fong. Her view of the 1993
budget is a direct challenge to Fong, who has slammed that budget
as ``the biggest tax increase in U.S. history.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Most respected economists say if not for that budget vote, the
economy would be growing even faster than it is today,'' said Steve
Schmidt, a spokesman for Fong. ``And it's preposterous to say
(Boxer) had any involvement in a positive way with a balanced
budget.''
</P>
<P>
   But the glowing economic news of the past few years is likely to
be one of Boxer's main weapons in her re-election bid, and she came
armed with statistics that show just how good the times have been.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bay Area has added more than 100,000 jobs in the past
year, 15 percent of the national increase in employment,'' the
senator said. ``It now has the nation's highest per capita income .
. . and the Silicon Valley now leads the nation in exports,
surpassing Detroit and New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who would have thought that not too many years ago?''
</P>
<P>
   While private businesses have played the main role in the
economic turnaround, the government, led by Democrats like herself
and President Clinton, helped lay the foundation for the recovery,
Boxer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We invested in education, infrastructure, scientific research
. . . sending a critical signal to investors and manufacturers that
the national government wanted to be a partner in this economic
recovery.''
</P>
<P>
   When talking about what has to be done to keep the economy
growing, Boxer touched on issues dear to Silicon Valley businesses,
including tougher intellectual property rights, open access to
encryption technology, updated export controls and permanent tax
credits for research.
</P>
<P>
   She also chided Fong and other Republicans, concerned about what
they see as the dangerous transfer of possible military technology
to countries like China, for supporting an effort to give the State
Department, rather than the Commerce Department, the final say on
exports.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would go back to the bad old days when companies here
tried to export simple things and couldn't get an answer from the
State Department,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Good times are not times for businesses, or the government, to
rest, the senator said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't be apathetic about where we are headed, we can't just
sit back and coast,'' Boxer said. ``We have to go forward with an
optimistic plan for the future.''
</P>

CRITICISM SURROUNDS MAKER OF DRUG FOR HEPATITIS C 
</HEADLINE>
   By CARL T. HALL  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ An anti-viral drug with a long history of
controversy in the fight against AIDS has reappeared as a treatment
for hepatitis C _ and immediately become the focus of new
complaints over the marketing practices of drugmaker
Schering-Plough Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors and regulators have accused the New Jersey-based company
of inflating the benefits and minimizing the side effects of a
newly approved hepatitis C treatment called Rebetron.
</P>
<P>
   The treatment consists of two drugs _ the anti-viral ribavirin
and Schering's Intron A, the company's proprietary brand of alpha
interferon _ taken in combination.
</P>
<P>
   A San Francisco patient-advocacy group turned up the heat
Thursday, condemning Schering for ``monopolistic and arrogant''
business practices by ``bundling'' the two drugs in a single
package, which sells for as much as $1,440 a month depending on
dosage, roughly double the price of alternative treatments using
only interferon.
</P>
<P>
   Ribavirin was touted in the early '80s by ICN Pharmaceuticals
Inc., a Costa Mesa, Calif.-based drugmaker, as a possible treatment
for AIDS. But the drug failed to live up to the company's
aggressive promotion, eventually prompting lawsuits by stockholders
and the Securities and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The company, headed by former Yugoslavian leader Milan Panic,
eventually settled the lawsuits and sold Schering exclusive U.S.
rights to ribavirin for $16.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Schering won U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval for the
dual-drug therapy on June 3. Within two weeks of the product's
launch, FDA officials issued a formal warning to Schering about its
promotional tactics.
</P>
<P>
   The agency accused Schering of avoiding mention of such side
effects as life-threatening anemia and ``severe psychiatric adverse
events,'' including several suicides, in patients with no prior
history of psychiatric illness.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the agency's complaints concerned statements that the
company made at a medical meeting in New Orleans even before the
drug was approved. In addition, the FDA said, Schering's news
release heralding the new treatment's debut ``fails to adequately
convey the serious risks associated with the use of Rebetron.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Consalvo, a Schering spokesman, said the complaints were
about ``one-time'' events, declining further comment.
</P>
<P>
   The news release, in its original form, is still being
distributed through the company's Web site. An FDA spokesman said
Thursday that the matter ``has not been resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, some doctors also have been raising complaints about
Schering's marketing.
</P>
<P>
   The expense and lack of access to ribavirin separately make it
virtually impossible for doctors to use the ribavirin in
combination with other interferons, such as Infergen, marketed by
Southern California-based Amgen Inc., or Roferon-A, sold by a unit
of Swiss drug giant Roche Holding AG.
</P>
<P>
   The marketing strategy ``impedes our progress for research in
this field,'' said Dr. Joanne Imperial, a liver-disease specialist
at Stanford Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Heidi Jolson, director of the FDA's division of anti-viral
drugs, said the company could sell the two ingredients separately
if it chose to do so, although this would require separate
approvals for new labels on each product.
</P>
<P>
   But Schering's Consalvo said the company has no plans to change
its marketing approach.
</P>
<P>
   The ``bundling'' strategy simply prevents competitors from
reaping the benefits of Schering's research, Consalvo said.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: FIGHTING TERRORISM UNDER THE OLD CODE
 &HT;    With photo mug of Glass available on the Cox Server.
 &HT;    Moving in both the (i) International and (k) Commentary
categories for use Sunday, Aug. 16 And Thereafter.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the outermost ring of the Pentagon, plans are
being drawn for a retaliatory strike against the terrorist bombers
who blew up the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, President Clinton must sign off on any use of force.
In ordering such an attack, Clinton must bear in mind today's
complex geopolitical climate. He must offer explicit proof of the
perpetrators' responsibility to the American public and to the
world at large.
</P>
<P>
   It's one thing for U.S. intelligence agencies to link the
carnage in East Africa to Osama bin Laden, the shadowy Saudi figure
who acts as the godfather of a network of radicals who have vowed
vengeance against the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But it's quite another to commit the Pentagon's directorate for
Special Operations and Low Intensity Conflicts (SOLIC) to a
military assault against bin Laden's terrorist bases in Afghanistan
and the Sudan. Even if a SOLIC raid achieved its immediate tactical
goals, long-term U.S. strategic interests could be harmed.
</P>
<P>
   One option under official review would sub-contract this
anti-terrorist task to interested and competent parties in
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   In rapidly dispatching their ace military rescue crews to
Nairobi, the Israelis no doubt also gathered some intelligence on
their own. But their primary motive was to repay a favor, which is
a basic, if often overlooked, element of statecraft.
</P>
<P>
   A big debt was incurred in 1976, when Kenya served as a
logistical base for Israel's successful raid on Uganda's Entebbe
Airport, rescuing the passengers on an Air France flight which had
been hijacked by Palestinian terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years later, William Buckley, then the CIA station chief
in Lebanon, was close to tracking down the masterminds behind the
suicide assault against the Marines in Beirut, which with one blow
killed about 10 percent of the U.S. forces in that country. But the
pursued became the pursuers and kidnapped Buckley.
</P>
<P>
   President Reagan thereupon asked Israel for aid. Israeli
leaders, mindful that Reagan had personally intervened to permit
stranded Ethiopian Jews to be flown out of the Sudan, agreed to
help.
</P>
<P>
   In that notorious instance, things didn't work out. Eventually,
Buckley was tortured and killed. And the Iranian connection which
the Israelis activated for Washington led eventually to scandalous
dealings in White House. But the age-old code of nations quietly
trading favors had been followed.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis are quite capable of making operational blunders of
their own, like the one that led to Hamas spiritual leader Sheik
Ahmed Yassin now being free in Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, in undertaking the kind of nasty work that needs to done,
Jerusalem can muster more operational flexibility than Washington
can. And the Israelis are probably better able to cope with the
next threatened cycle of revenge if, and when it comes.
</P>
<P>
   What's the chief downside to making an anti-terrorist deal? In
succeeding, the Israelis would undoubtedly ask for favors in
return. Yet, with such high stakes, Clinton could do worse than to
have his Pentagon planners stand down while calling instead on
outside experts to do the job at hand.

 &HT;    GROUP WEDDINGS IN WEST BANK PROMOTES ISLAM, FUELS HAMAS
 &HT;    With photo to be placed in the International folder on the Cox
Server by The Palm Beach Post.
 &HT;    For Use Saturday, Aug. 15 And Thereafter.
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox Newspapers 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NABLUS, West Bank _ On the soccer stadium stage, behind the
multi-colored disco lights and with fireworks streaking above, this
is their moment of glory.
</P>
<P>
   They were 35 Islamic grooms, holding above their heads
red-covered Korans and green flags of Islam. They looked out at a
crowd of about 15,000 people, men on the field in front and women,
including their brides, on the bleachers in back.
</P>
<P>
   This recent rally was the second annual Islamic wedding in
Nablus. This large city in Israel's West Bank is one of several
that has come under Palestinian control after Israel began
withdrawing from land it captured in the 1967 war.
</P>
<P>
   The wedding itself is a showcase for Islamic values and, nearly
as important, provides an affordable marriage for couples. Weddings
here usually require the groom to spend thousands of dollars on
gifts and parties -- a test of suitability that is hard to meet in
today's West Bank recession.
</P>
<P>
   But, the event is also informally called the ``Hamas wedding,''
for the group that helped pay the $10,000 to hold it and, according
to some observers, reaps the biggest benefit from generating
interest in fundamentalist Islam.
</P>
<P>
   Hamas, a group known for its opposition to the
Israeli-Palestinian peace process and the terrorist bombings
committed by its military wing, has built a local reputation as a
guardian of Islamic purity.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see, Hamas is not just the military wing,'' said
Jordan-based Hamas spokesman Ibrihim Ghosheh, who said similar
weddings have been held in Amman. ``These Muslims are the raw
material for Hamas.''
</P>
<P>
   Ghosheh vowed that Hamas' military wing is still seeking to
commit attacks against Israelis, but has been stymied by its rival,
Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority.
</P>
<P>
   In support and institutions, Hamas is still far behind the
Arafat's Fatah movement, the largest Palestinian party.
</P>
<P>
   But support for the group wedding, kindergartens, health
clinics, universities and even a soccer team, have helped Hamas
gain a reputation for good works compared to the corruption often
cited in Arafat's secular party.
</P>
<P>
   On this day, most of the grooms do not wear the beards of
religious Muslims. They include businessmen and students who rode
to the stadium from a mosque nearby on horses -- the horseman being
a mythical Islamic archetype.
</P>
<P>
   The event illustrates the sometimes unclear crossover between
fundamentalist Islam and Hamas.
</P>
<P>
   They note that the bill was paid by several local charities and
the crowd is composed of all kinds of Palestinians -- religious,
secular, old and young.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a Hamas wedding. Hamas is part of the Palestinian
people and these are Palestinians,'' said Sheikh Hamed Betawi, the
organizer who is a fiery anti-Israel sermonizer and Hamas
supporter.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Israeli Jews running the sound system at the event,
Betawi said it shows that Palestinians oppose Israel's policies,
not its people.
</P>
<P>
   The wedding is supposed to be an example for secular
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Betawi said Palestinian weddings are getting too western. Men
and women mix, dance and drink alcohol. None of that will go on in
their weddings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe the west has prospered economically,'' Betawi said.
``But their behavior in the west has disconnected them from their
ties to God.''
</P>
<P>
   These 35 couples had their legal marriages conducted before the
rally, part of a lengthy, multi-step process that culminates with a
small ceremony weeks later when the groom takes the bride to spend
their first night together.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have girlfriends,'' explained groom Iqab Jamil, a
25-year-old television repairman, adding that good Muslims do not
date casually, but select a woman and arrange a marriage through
their families.
</P>
<P>
   He said he is not a Hamas supporter, but simply a ``a Muslim
without any organization.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Another groom, Wael Hashash, is a 28-year-old student and
teacher of Islamic studies who spent time in Israeli jails for
Hamas activity. He said he approves of Hamas's terror attacks
because the Israeli army has killed Arab civilians.
</P>
<P>
   He joined the group wedding because it was affordable and showed
that fundamental Islam can be fun. His sister helped him choose his
wife, another religion student at his university.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is to show people the other side of Islam,'' he adds, on
stage amid the balloons and a troupe of Arabic vocalists.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting a week later at a small wedding celebration near his
house -- held in two separate houses for men and women -- he
explains the courtship of his wife.
</P>
<P>
   They barely spoke until their families approved of their
engagement 17 months ago. Hashash would not accept a woman who
would speak to suitors before they were engaged.
</P>
<P>
   The group wedding and other social projects are part of Islam,
he said, and Hamas is showing Palestinians that it stands for ``the
right Islamic concepts.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: FIGHTING TERRORISM UNDER THE OLD CODE
 &HT;    With photo mug of Glass available on the Cox Server.

categories for use Sunday, Aug. 16 And Thereafter.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the outermost ring of the Pentagon, plans are
being drawn for a retaliatory strike against the terrorist bombers
who blew up the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, President Clinton must sign off on any use of force.
In ordering such an attack, Clinton must bear in mind today's
complex geopolitical climate. He must offer explicit proof of the
perpetrators' responsibility to the American public and to the
world at large.
</P>
<P>
   It's one thing for U.S. intelligence agencies to link the
carnage in East Africa to Osama bin Laden, the shadowy Saudi figure
who acts as the godfather of a network of radicals who have vowed
vengeance against the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But it's quite another to commit the Pentagon's directorate for
Special Operations and Low Intensity Conflicts (SOLIC) to a
military assault against bin Laden's terrorist bases in Afghanistan
and the Sudan. Even if a SOLIC raid achieved its immediate tactical
goals, long-term U.S. strategic interests could be harmed.
</P>
<P>
   One option under official review would sub-contract this
anti-terrorist task to interested and competent parties in
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   In rapidly dispatching their ace military rescue crews to
Nairobi, the Israelis no doubt also gathered some intelligence on
their own. But their primary motive was to repay a favor, which is
a basic, if often overlooked, element of statecraft.
</P>
<P>
   A big debt was incurred in 1976, when Kenya served as a
logistical base for Israel's successful raid on Uganda's Entebbe
Airport, rescuing the passengers on an Air France flight which had
been hijacked by Palestinian terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years later, William Buckley, then the CIA station chief
in Lebanon, was close to tracking down the masterminds behind the
suicide assault against the Marines in Beirut, which with one blow
killed about 10 percent of the U.S. forces in that country. But the
pursued became the pursuers and kidnapped Buckley.
</P>
<P>
   President Reagan thereupon asked Israel for aid. Israeli
leaders, mindful that Reagan had personally intervened to permit
stranded Ethiopian Jews to be flown out of the Sudan, agreed to
help.
</P>
<P>
   In that notorious instance, things didn't work out. Eventually,
Buckley was tortured and killed. And the Iranian connection which
the Israelis activated for Washington led eventually to scandalous
dealings in White House. But the age-old code of nations quietly
trading favors had been followed.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis are quite capable of making operational blunders of
their own, like the one that led to Hamas spiritual leader Sheik
Ahmed Yassin now being free in Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, in undertaking the kind of nasty work that needs to done,
Jerusalem can muster more operational flexibility than Washington
can. And the Israelis are probably better able to cope with the
next threatened cycle of revenge if, and when it comes.
</P>
<P>
   What's the chief downside to making an anti-terrorist deal? In
succeeding, the Israelis would undoubtedly ask for favors in
return. Yet, with such high stakes, Clinton could do worse than to
have his Pentagon planners stand down while calling instead on
outside experts to do the job at hand.

CHILDREN ARE RIGHT, THE ACTION IS OVERHEAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL TAMMEUS  
 c. 1998 KANSAS CITY STAR 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND LAKE, Colo. _ Insistent but rickety clouds the color of
old pewter hang over the mountain I can see across the lake here,
hiding its peak and spilling an intermittent cool rain that slides
down the breeze. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I'm sitting on the wide veranda of Grand Lake Lodge thinking
about sky, in which these slowly moving clouds are not trespassers
but migrant citizens. Maybe I'm thinking about sky because here in
the Rocky Mountains, 1,200 feet or so below timberline, it feels as
if I'm closer to sky than I am on the plains where I live. But
that's a foolish notion, unsubstantiated by any science worthy of
the name. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rather, I'm thinking about sky here because it brings the
weather like so much imported, unordered clothing. And living here
a few days at the foot of tall jack pines spread thick through the
mountains, I sense that weather is upon us without much warning.
The view of sky is quite limited here, so rain can come from behind
a mountain and we don't know until it's nearly overhead. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This differs radically from the skies at home in Kansas City.
There on the flatlands I can watch storms approach for hours
sometimes. Rarely do those skies surprise. Only occasional
lightning bolts sprung nearly ex nihilo from a hot, hazy sky has
the capacity to shock. All else has observable preludes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Colorado's Rockies have summer skies that can change with
rapidity. But, as I say, part of that perception is due to how
little of the hemisphere of sky one can see at once. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That aspect is much different from the skies I watched a few
weeks ago in the high desert country of northern New Mexico. What
an astonishing show the skies there offer. Something amazing _ or
at least engaging _ is nearly always happening in those heavens,
which dome over red rock hills and arroyos and dry plains and are
rarely hidden by anything. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You can simultaneously see a bright sun in a breathless blue
vault of sky in the south, a menacing thunder storm in the west,
fantastically stacked cumulus clouds in the east and small puffs of
innocent white clouds in the north. All at once, mind you. And 15
minutes later it's all changed. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Whether I'm here in Colorado or in New Mexico or at home on the
plains I almost never think about the atmosphere that surrounds me.
And yet it is the very guarantor of my physical life. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Atmosphere means, literally, sphere of breath, and if I somehow
step outside the atmosphere without artificial means of breathing,
I'm finished. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   How seldom, on the plains, do I consider the crazy idea of
running out of air. Yet we are never far from that disaster. In the
cosmic scheme of things, the atmosphere is alarmingly thin. You and
I dwell in what scientists call the troposphere, or lower layer of
atmosphere. Here is where we draw the breath of life. Here is where
we see overarching marble-blue skies and rainbows and clouds with
shades of gray that range from almost white to almost black. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here is where we see sheet lightning turn the horizon into what
look like old, badly lit 8-millimeter movies flickering in a far
room. And here is where stupendous lightning bolts tear the
atmosphere into jagged parts crackling with nature's killing
power. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is through the troposphere that we look _ toward, in
succession, the stratosphere, mesosphere, thermosphere and
exosphere _ to see the eerie northern lights and watch shooting
stars flame out like some run-amok rock star blazing to death on
drugs and fast times. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We didn't know much about the atmosphere until Evangelista
Torricelli invented the barometer in 1643. By then William
Shakespeare had been dead nearly 30 years. (Imagine him writing his
complete works without even a foundational knowledge of the
atmosphere in which he wrote.) But it's been only in the last 100
years or so that we have come to something like a sophisticated
understanding of the envelope of air around us. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I suppose I must be out of my usual surroundings to pay
prolonged attention to something as common as sky. And I've been so
intent on seeing what's above me here that I now notice I've
ignored huge yellow and purple pansies in a flower box near my
feet. I've paid no attention to motor boats skimming the lake in
front of choppy V's. I haven't even seen the steam rising from wet
wooden lodge steps because the sun has slid through the clouds. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the real action is overhead. No wonder children lie on their
backs and see elephants in clouds. And dragons. They have it right.
The atmosphere, which keeps us alive, is itself alive, if only we
will attend to its dramas. &QL;
</P>

``Your Friends and Neighbors.'' 
 (EDS.: Nastassja Kinski is cq) 
 By IVOR DAVIS 
 World rights except Great Britain and Australia 
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features  
 &HT;    He ran off to Ireland with Julia Roberts to comfort her just a
couple of days after she dumped fiancee Kiefer Sutherland on the
eve of their wedding. He has squired beautiful women like Robin
Wright (Sean Penn's wife) and Isabelle Adjani, and his current
girlfriend is Maybelline supermodel Christy Turlington.
 &HT;    So it would seem ideal that Jason Patric should play a womanizer
in his controversial new movie ``Your Friends and Neighbors''
(opening Aug. 19 in New York and Los Angeles and elsewhere on Aug.
28 and Sept. 4).
 &HT;    In the movie Jason's character Cary is a superbly buffed sexual
athlete who sees himself as a love machine, bedding women as a pure
athletic endeavour or in revenge for injustices he feels women have
done him.
 &HT;    He's a nasty, narcissistic meanie _ and it's a role that Patric,
who also produced the film, carefully picked for himself. Dressed
in black from shirt to shoes, the handsome actor sits in a hotel
suite in Beverly Hills and makes no apologies for stepping into
such a nasty role.
 &HT;    ``I've played dark and edgy characters before, but never this
dark or edgy. The scary thing about this guy and the thing that
drew me to him is that he has an explanation or justification for
everything he does. And he seems to have no remorse ... I think
that's chilling because as awful as it may be sometimes, it's
fascinating to watch.''
 &HT;    Patric sees the movie, a morality tale about three guys and the
women in their lives, as wickedly funny because he says he and
others have been there. ``The situations are all ones that we think
of, or that we've been involved in. You're laughing, which is a
reflexive response, but you're also forced to breathe in the brutal
reality of what you're watching.''
 &HT;    The ensemble piece is from writer-director Neil LaBute and the
dysfunctional characters are played by Amy Brenneman, Ben Stiller,
Nastassja Kinski, Catherine Keener and Aaron Eckhart. Eckhart last
appeared in LaBute's controversial film ``In the Company of Men,''
about two nasty businessmen who _ on a bet _ seduce a beautiful
deaf secretary.
 &HT;    In ``Your Friends and Neighbors,'' the men swap the woman, and
one woman swaps her man for another woman. But Cary is the most
diabolical of the lot. And as for Patric's ``we've all been there''
line, how many people do you know who practice their sexual
dialogue into a tape recorder while pumping iron?
 &HT;    Yet Patric says he didn't have such a hard time stepping into
the skin of the despicable Cary. ``You have to find those dark
places in yourself,'' he says. ``I've been in relationships where
I've wanted to strangle the other person for some reason. I've
wanted to shoot people for cutting me off on the freeway ... Actors
are fortunate because playing dark characters allows us to free
those hidden emotions.''
 &HT;    Until fairly recently Patric says he avoided starring in
mainstream movies because he wanted to make films that meant
something to him personally.
 &HT;    The grandson of the late comedian Jackie Gleason, and son of
playwright-actor Jason Miller, Patric has worked mostly in
uncommercial films like ``Geronimo: An American Legend'' (1993),
``Rush'' (1991), ``After Dark My Sweet'' (1990) and ``Sleepers''
(1996).
 &HT;    Two years ago he decided to try for a wider audience and agreed
to step into the sequel to ``Speed'' _ ``Speed 2: Cruise Control''
_ opposite Sandra Bullock, when Keanu Reeves turned it down. The
picture was overpriced and a resounding box office flop.
 &HT;    It didn't do much for his reputation but he doesn't regret
taking the big paycheck.
 &HT;    ``I had been offered many 'Speed 2's' in my life and I turned
them all down,'' he says. ``Then at this point in my career I
realised a I needed a mainstream movie to give me the clout to get
the movies I really wanted to be in. That meant I had to be visible
in the global marketplace. And there was no question that film made
me visible _ maybe all for the wrong reasons. But it worked. I was
able to get the $7 million I needed to make 'Your Friends and
Neighbors.'''
 &HT;    Patric is one of those actors who is as handsome off-screen as
movie stars are supposed to be and so seldom are. It's not
something he particularly wants to talk about, however.
 &HT;    It makes him ``uncomfortable,'' he says, when actors are defined
by their looks. ``I'd rather not talk about it or consider it. But
the truth is beautiful people have an advantage in this world
because we want to like them. A beautiful girl can get away with
murder in a relationship based solely on her looks,'' says the man
who has dated his share of gorgeous ladies and should know what
he's talking about.
 &HT;    ``We have certain expectations based on the way a person looks
and when we discover that's not who they are under the surface we
become disappointed and angry.''
 &HT;    While still not considered an A-list box office draw like Tom
Cruise, Brad Pitt or Leonardo DiCaprio, Patric feels being in
charge of his own life and work provides greater satisfaction.
 &HT;    Through his recently formed Fleece Productions he has two
projects in the works _ neither of them blockbuster material. The
first is ``The Gipp,'' which could team him with director Francis
Ford Coppola in a story about Notre Dame football great George
Gipp. There's also ``1066,'' an historical film about the Battle of
Hastings, the decisive victory in the Norman conquest of England.
 &HT;    Patric believes he did his best work in the early '90s, and he
fervently hopes those best days aren't behind him. ``I was given
such great material. Now at 32 I like the idea that I was really a
brazen actor in my early 20s. I only wish I'd done more films. Now
I have to really search for the material.''

SOMEBODY DO SOMETHING 
</HEADLINE>
  By DAVID PLOTZ 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   I first realized something was terribly, terribly wrong when a
Fox News producer called me yesterday. She wanted me to opine about
the scandal on Sunday, when the cable news channel will do a
Flytrap marathon in anticipation of the president's testimony. Her
call was fishy for two reasons: 1) I am not usually first, or
second, or last on any TV booker's guest list; and 2) she said the
following to me, imploringly: ``We're really looking for something
different. Can you be different?''
</P>
<P>
   (Well, I thought to myself, of course I can be different. My
mother always told me I was ``different.'')
</P>
<P>
   The pursuit of wretched excess in Flytrap--a pursuit in which
Slate has eagerly participated--is producing some unfortunate
results. One is the rising popularity of preposterous conspiracy
theories. The Punditry Crisis is another. Not since the late-O.J.
era has America faced such an alarming moment. Is there anything
left to say?
</P>
<P>
   The crisis is, at bottom, a market failure. Ratings demonstrate
that TV viewers (never mind their protestations) want to hear about
Flytrap all the time. The gross appetites of CNN, MSNBC, and Fox
must be sated. ``Crossfire'' must have fire. ``Hardball'' must be
hard. ``Face the Nation'' must have someone to face. But there's
not enough supply to meet the demand.
</P>
<P>
   As Aug. 17 approaches, Flytrap is in an information blackout.
The White House is silent, and Starr's office has stopped leaking.
Every hypothesis has been hypothesized. Every theory theorized.
Every spin spun. Each tiny nugget of new information is chewed,
swallowed, regurgitated as cud, and chewed again. Pundits are
reduced to flogging thirdhand and fourthhand rumors. Can any TV
watcher endure another Jonathan Turley sermon or Lanny Davis ``wait
and see'' or Laura Ingraham huff?
</P>
<P>
   Too much demand, too little supply. TV producers are on a
desperate, futile quest for someone--or something--different to put
on the air. (This crisis is not, of course, limited to television:
Those of us in the print and e-media are thrashing through the same
news vacuum.)
</P>
<P>
   I really don't know what pundits will do. We have six days to
fill. And there's nothing,'' warns Time's Margaret Carlson. ``If I
had even one new fact, I would lock it in a vault until I could use
it (in a column or on television). If I had even one new
observation, I would not breathe a word about it until I could use
it. One piece of real news would eat all this (blather) up like
kudzu.''
</P>
<P>
   Not every pundit is worrying about the crisis. Some Panglossian
commentators claim there is no crisis at all. One compares Flytrap
to World War I trench battles: ``No one is getting overrun, but
steady progress is being made.'' In fact, he says, plenty of
fascinating new details emerge every day. (When asked for an
example of such a detail, he suggests, halfheartedly, ``what Monica
ate for lunch.'')
</P>
<P>
   And for freshly minted Flytrap pundits such as Turley, there is
no crisis, either. This is their moment. No topic is so stale that
it cannot be reheated: After all, it gets you air time. And
besides, say the Panglossians, no matter how much Flytrap nothing
is being spewed, think how much worse it would be if there were no
scandal at all. At least it's something to talk about.
</P>
<P>
   But should we simply relax and let the Punditry Crisis grow into
a catastrophe? Right-thinking people can agree: We should not.
Stuart Taylor Jr., in a moment of high-minded optimism, proposes
that pundits take advantage of the information vacuum to talk about
first principles. Instead of jabbing fingers over Monica's dress,
for example, they should discuss the fundamentals of sexual
harassment law. I'm not sure Taylor's worthy solution is possible
but, whether it is or it isn't, I think we can all concur that that
the Punditry Crisis requires immediate action. Well, maybe not
action, but definitely a lot more talk.

TEMPERANCE KILLS 
</HEADLINE>
  By JONATHAN RAUCH 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   First, to prevent any misunderstanding, the warning: Alcohol,
when abused, is vicious, dangerous stuff. Each year about 100,000
Americans die alcohol-related deaths. No one should drink and drive
or drink to excess. Some people--teen-agers, people on
contraindicated medications, pregnant women, and those who have
trouble controlling their consumption--should avoid alcohol,
period. And all that you know already.
</P>
<P>
   Here is what you may not know--or may know only fuzzily. For
most people of middle age and beyond, one drink a day helps prevent
heart disease and makes you less likely to die prematurely. After
one or (for men) two drinks, bad effects swamp the good--dosage is
everything! But on average the positive cardiovascular effect of
moderate drinking is not small, and it is not in dispute.
Epidemiologists figure that if all Americans became teetotalers
tomorrow, about 80,000 more people might die each year of heart
disease. So there are lives on both sides of the equation.
</P>
<P>
   One of those lives might, just as an example, belong to my
father. He is 69, has mild hypertension (controlled with
medication) and, but for the rare social occasion, doesn't drink.
He has read some news reports suggesting moderate alcohol use may
yield benefits, but his doctor has never mentioned such benefits,
and my father has never given a thought to changing his drinking
habits. And, in the standard view of public health officialdom,
that is as it should be: People should not be encouraged to drink,
even in moderation, and alcohol should not be linked with better
health.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is that moderate drinking is linked with better
health. We don't know exactly why; some evidence suggests
alcohol--of whatever sort, by the way, not just red
wine--stimulates ``good'' (HDL, for high density lipoprotein)
cholesterol and may help prevent blood clotting. But we do know the
effects: On average, if you're over about 40, a drink a day will
reduce your chances of heart trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides the association between smoking and lung cancer, I
think this is the most consistent association I've seen in the
literature,'' says Eric Rimm, a Harvard epidemiologist. Research
has shown heart benefits consistently since the 1970s with, Rimm
guesses, 70 or 80 studies of 30 to 35 countries by now. Not
surprisingly, he has a drink on most days.
</P>
<P>
   Alcohol also causes harm, of course. It can increase chances of
breast cancer, cirrhosis, accidents, and so on. Heart disease,
however, is an enormous cause of death; improve those odds, and the
net effect is significantly to the good. Last December, the New
England Journal of Medicine reported the results of the biggest and
probably best mortality study yet conducted, one that followed
almost half a million people over nine years. It found that, after
netting out all causes of death, moderate drinkers over 30 were 20
percent less likely than nondrinkers to die prematurely.
</P>
<P>
   But there are a lot of people like my father out there:
uninformed or vaguely informed or not thinking about it. In 1995, a
free market advocacy group called the Competitive Enterprise
Institute commissioned a survey asking people whether they believed
``that scientific evidence exists showing that moderate consumption
of alcohol, approximately one or two drinks per day, may reduce the
risk of heart disease for many people.'' Only 42 percent of those
who responded said they did, and a majority of those believed,
wrongly, that the potential benefits come only from wine.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence on alcohol and health is now more than 20 years
old--so why the confusion? Two groups have a stake in getting the
word out, but one of them, the alcohol industry, is effectively
forbidden to do so. Every bottle of alcohol carries a government
warning label, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms has
never permitted ads or labels to carry any health claims, even mild
ones.
</P>
<P>
   Given that the government restricts health claims even for
innocuous foods such as orange juice and eggs, it's reasonable to
decide that booze merchants are the wrong people to entrust with
public education about drinking. That leaves only one other
constituency for getting the word out: the public health community.
Its approach, however, might charitably be called cautious--or,
less charitably, embarrassed mumbling.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the authors of the aforementioned New England
Journal study characterized their finding of a 20 percent mortality
reduction as ``slight.'' The accompanying editorial called it
``small.''
</P>
<P>
   I phoned Michael J. Thun, one of the study's authors and an
epidemiologist with the American Cancer Society, and asked him
whether a 20 percent mortality reduction is indeed small in the
world of epidemiology. ``It's a sizable benefit in terms of
prolonged survival,'' he said. Why not say so? ``Messages about
alcohol don't come out the way you say them when they're
broadcast,'' he replied. ``There's been a very long history in
society of problems with alcohol.''
</P>
<P>
   The British health authorities, in their 1995 guidelines
(``Sensible Drinking''), say that people who drink very little or
not at all and are in an age group at high risk for heart disease
should ``consider the possibility that light drinking might benefit
their health.'' But American authorities balk even at such a modest
suggestion.
</P>
<P>
   And so the U.S. official nutritional guidelines say just this
about potential benefits: ``Current evidence suggests that moderate
drinking is associated with a lower risk for coronary heart disease
in some individuals.''
</P>
<P>
   They then go on to recite a litany of risks. Similarly, the
American Heart Association's official recommendation advises, ``If
you drink, do so in moderation.'' It goes on to say heart disease
is lower in moderate drinkers but then warns of other dangers and
cautions against ``guidelines to the general public'' that
encourage drinking. See for yourself, but I think the message most
people would get from both sources is ``Drinking isn't all bad, but
eschew it anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   I asked Ronald Krauss--a doctor who, as the immediate past
chairman of the American Heart Association's nutrition committee,
helped write that statement--whether it was aggressive enough. ``We
don't have much leeway around that 'one or two drinks a day,''' he
said, and what isn't known is whether encouraging moderate drinking
will also encourage excessive drinking.
</P>
<P>
   The public health people understandably dread creating more
drunks, more broken marriages, more crime, more car wrecks. ``When
somebody calls you up saying, 'You're putting out a message to
people to drink, and my daughter just got killed last night because
of some drunk,' that's the other side of the equation,'' Thun says.
``There are substantial numbers of people out there who are looking
for justification to drink more than they should.''
</P>
<P>
   A real worry. But there are lives, again, on both sides of the
equation. The question, then, is what would happen if the public
health folks ran a campaign saying, for example, ``Just One Drink''
or ``Drink a Little--Not a Lot.'' Would people's drinking habits
improve, or would we create a nation of drunks--or what? The answer
is: Nobody knows. What is surprising, given the public health
community's usual eagerness to save lives, is that no one is trying
to find out. It is simply assumed that too many people will do the
wrong thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have a very hard time with complicated messages,'' says
Thun. No doubt some people do. But is it really so hard to
understand that a glass a day may help save your life if you're of
middle age or beyond, but that more than that is dangerous?
Presumably an avoidable heart attack is equally tragic whether the
cause is too much alcohol or too little. To continue today's policy
of muttering and changing the subject verges perilously on saying
not just that too much alcohol is bad for you but that ignorance is
good for you.

BABY-SITTING THE ECONOMY 
</HEADLINE>
  By PAUL KRUGMAN 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Twenty years ago I read a story that changed my life. I think
about that story often; it helps me to stay calm in the face of
crisis, to remain hopeful in times of depression, and to resist the
pull of fatalism and pessimism. At this gloomy moment, when Asia's
woes seem to threaten the world economy as a whole, the lessons of
that inspirational tale are more important than ever.
</P>
<P>
   The story is told in an article titled ``Monetary Theory and the
Great Capitol Hill Baby-Sitting Co-op Crisis.'' Joan and Richard
Sweeney published it in the Journal of Money, Credit, and Banking
in 1978. I've used their story in two of my books, Peddling
Prosperity and The Accidental Theorist, but it bears retelling,
this time with an Asian twist.
</P>
<P>
   The Sweeneys tell the story of--you guessed it--a baby-sitting
co-op, one to which they belonged in the early 1970s. Such co-ops
are quite common: A group of people (in this case about 150 young
couples with congressional connections) agrees to baby-sit for one
another, obviating the need for cash payments to adolescents. It's
a mutually beneficial arrangement: A couple that already has
children around may find that watching another couple's kids for an
evening is not that much of an additional burden, certainly
compared with the benefit of receiving the same service some other
evening. But there must be a system for making sure each couple
does its fair share.
</P>
<P>
   The Capitol Hill co-op adopted one fairly natural solution. It
issued scrip--pieces of paper equivalent to one hour of
baby-sitting time. Baby sitters would receive the appropriate
number of coupons directly from the baby sittees. This made the
system self-enforcing: Over time, each couple would automatically
do as much baby-sitting as it received in return. As long as the
people were reliable--and these young professionals certainly
were--what could go wrong?
</P>
<P>
   Well, it turned out that there was a small technical problem.
Think about the coupon holdings of a typical couple. During periods
when it had few occasions to go out, a couple would probably try to
build up a reserve--then run that reserve down when the occasions
arose. There would be an averaging out of these demands. One couple
would be going out when another was staying at home. But since many
couples would be holding reserves of coupons at any given time, the
co-op needed to have a fairly large amount of scrip in circulation.
</P>
<P>
   Now what happened in the Sweeneys' co-op was that, for
complicated reasons involving the collection and use of dues (paid
in scrip), the number of coupons in circulation became quite low.
As a result, most couples were anxious to add to their reserves by
baby-sitting, reluctant to run them down by going out. But one
couple's decision to go out was another's chance to baby-sit; so it
became difficult to earn coupons. Knowing this, couples became even
more reluctant to use their reserves except on special occasions,
reducing baby-sitting opportunities still further.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the co-op had fallen into a recession. Since most of
the co-op's members were lawyers, it was difficult to convince them
the problem was monetary. They tried to legislate recovery--passing
a rule requiring each couple to go out at least twice a month. But
eventually the economists prevailed. More coupons were issued,
couples became more willing to go out, opportunities to baby-sit
multiplied, and everyone was happy.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, of course, the co-op issued too much scrip, leading
to different problems.
</P>
<P>
   If you think this is a silly story, a waste of your time, shame
on you. What the Capitol Hill Baby-Sitting Co-op experienced was a
real recession. Its story tells you more about what economic slumps
are and why they happen than you will get from reading 500 pages of
William Greider and a year's worth of Wall Street Journal
editorials.
</P>
<P>
   And if you are willing to really wrap your mind around the
co-op's story, to play with it and draw out its implications, it
will change the way you think about the world.

 (NO DATELINE: about the world.)
<TEXT>
<P>
   For example, suppose that the U.S. stock market was to crash,
threatening to undermine consumer confidence. Would this inevitably
mean a disastrous recession? Think of it this way: When consumer
confidence declines, it is as if, for some reason, the typical
member of the co-op had become less willing to go out, more anxious
to accumulate coupons for a rainy day. This could indeed lead to a
slump--but need not if the management were alert and responded by
simply issuing more coupons. That is exactly what our head
coupon-issuer Alan Greenspan did in 1987--and what I believe he
would do again. So as I said at the beginning, the story of the
baby-sitting co-op helps me to remain calm in the face of crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Or suppose Greenspan did not respond quickly enough and that the
economy did indeed fall into a slump. Don't panic. Even if the
head-coupon issuer has fallen temporarily behind the curve, he can
still ordinarily turn the situation around by issuing more
coupons--that is, with a vigorous monetary expansion like the ones
that ended the recessions of 1981-82 and 1990-91. So as I said, the
story of the baby-sitting co-op helps me remain hopeful in times of
depression.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, the story of the co-op tells you that economic slumps
are not punishments for our sins, pains that we are fated to
suffer. The Capitol Hill co-op did not get into trouble because its
members were bad, inefficient baby sitters; its troubles did not
reveal the fundamental flaws of ``Capitol Hill values'' or ``crony
baby-sittingism.'' It had a technical problem--too many people
chasing too little scrip--which could be, and was, solved with a
little clear thinking. And so, as I said, the co-op's story helps
me to resist the pull of fatalism and pessimism.
</P>
<P>
   But if it's all so easy, how can a large part of the world be in
the mess it's in? How, for example, can Japan be stuck in a
seemingly intractable slump--one that it does not seem able to get
out of simply by printing coupons?
</P>
<P>
   Well, if we extend the co-op's story a little bit, it is not
hard to generate something that looks a lot like Japan's
problems--and to see the outline of a solution.
</P>
<P>
   First, we have to imagine a co-op the members of which realized
there was an unnecessary inconvenience in their system. There would
be occasions when a couple found itself needing to go out several
times in a row, which would cause it to run out of coupons--and
therefore be unable to get its babies sat--even though it was
entirely willing to do lots of compensatory baby-sitting at a later
date.
</P>
<P>
   To resolve this problem, the co-op allowed members to borrow
extra coupons from the management in times of need--repaying with
the coupons received from subsequent baby-sitting. To prevent
members from abusing this privilege, however, the management would
probably need to impose some penalty--requiring borrowers to repay
more coupons than they borrowed.
</P>
<P>
   Under this new system, couples would hold smaller reserves of
coupons than before, knowing they could borrow more if necessary.
The co-op's officers would, however, have acquired a new tool of
management. If members of the co-op reported it was easy to find
baby sitters and hard to find opportunities to baby-sit, the terms
under which members could borrow coupons could be made more
favorable, encouraging more people to go out. If baby sitters were
scarce, those terms could be worsened, encouraging people to go out
less.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, this more sophisticated co-op would have a
central bank that could stimulate a depressed economy by reducing
the interest rate and cool off an overheated one by raising it.
</P>
<P>
   But what about Japan--where the economy slumps despite interest
rates having fallen almost to zero? Has the baby-sitting metaphor
finally found a situation it cannot handle?
</P>
<P>
   Well, imagine there is a seasonality in the demand and supply
for baby-sitting. During the winter, when it's cold and dark,
couples don't want to go out much but are quite willing to stay
home and look after other people's children--thereby accumulating
points they can use on balmy summer evenings. If this seasonality
isn't too pronounced, the co-op could still keep the supply and
demand for baby-sitting in balance by charging low interest rates
in the winter months, higher rates in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   But suppose that the seasonality is very strong indeed. Then in
the winter, even at a zero interest rate, there will be more
couples seeking opportunities to baby-sit than there are couples
going out, which will mean that baby-sitting opportunities will be
hard to find, which means that couples seeking to build up reserves
for summer fun will be even less willing to use those points in the
winter, meaning even fewer opportunities to baby-sit ... and the
co-op will slide into a recession even at a zero interest rate.
</P>
<P>
   And this is the winter of Japan's discontent. Perhaps because of
its aging population, perhaps also because of a general nervousness
about the future, the Japanese public does not appear willing to
spend enough to use the economy's capacity, even at a zero interest
rate. Japan, say the economists, has fallen into the dread
``liquidity trap.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, what you have just read is an infantile explanation of
what a liquidity trap is and how it can happen. And once you
understand that this is what has gone wrong, the answer to Japan's
problems is, of course, quite obvious.
</P>
<P>
   So the story of the baby-sitting co-op is not a mere amusement.
If people would only take it seriously--if they could only
understand that when great economic issues are at stake, whimsical
parables are not a waste of time but the key to enlightenment--it
is a story that could save the world.

GREED AMERICAN STYLE
</HEADLINE>
  By JAMES SUROWIECKI 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As U.S.-style capitalism spreads around the world, foreign
shareholders are going to have to fight very hard to keep U.S-style
compensation practices from spreading with them. If they don't,
before too long foreign corporations are going to feature the same
kind of top-heavy, high-reward-for-low-risk pay scales that are
fattening CEOs and their subordinates at every major--and
not-so-major--American company.
</P>
<P>
   Striking evidence of this arrived last week in the form of a
proxy statement filed by Chrysler, which showed that current
Chrysler CEO Bob Eaton will receive $70 million in cash and stock
next year. This is 35 times the salary of Daimler CEO Jurgen
Schrempp, with whom he'll be running the new DaimlerChrysler.
</P>
<P>
   Eaton's base salary will be twice that of Schrempp. But he'll
also receive 628,000 shares of stock in the new company. These
aren't stock options, but actual shares, which means they're pure
gravy. Eaton will also receive warrants on another 2.3 million
shares, and he worked a nice little deal with his pension benefits
as well. As long as he sticks around for three years, he'll get an
extra $30,000 a month after he retires. But then, what's $30,000 a
month between friends?
</P>
<P>
   Oh, Eaton also has a new golden parachute clause in his
contract. If he gets fired in the first two years, he takes home a
cool $24 million.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, if you add up the salaries of the entire 10-member
management board that runs Daimler, they amount to less than what
Chrysler's former No. 2 guy, Bob Lutz, made last year. Daimler's
execs, in fact, made slightly less in 1997 than they did in 1996,
even though the company's business has been booming.
</P>
<P>
   There's no economic reason for the discrepancy, of course.
Chrysler hasn't been doing better than Daimler, nor is it bigger.
No sensible person would argue that Eaton is a better CEO than
Schrempp. And the difference in pay can't be attributed solely to
stock options, either. What it can be attributed to is an American
corporate culture in which stratospheric salaries are now seen as a
matter of course. It's a culture in which the idea that there
should be some reasonable ratio between the salary of the
highest-paid employee and the lowest-paid employee at a company is
as discredited as Marxism itself.
</P>
<P>
   The burden of curbing CEO salaries falls on the boards of
directors of U.S. corporations. But who sits on these boards?
Mostly executives from other companies, and it's hardly in their
interest to curb executive compensation. When he ran Warner
Communications, Steve Ross made sure that everyone below him lived
high on the hog, so that his own lavish pay and free use of the
company expense account would be relatively unnoticed. You might
say that the same logic is at work in the boardrooms of America.
</P>
<P>
   The argument, of course, is that you have to reward excellent
performance with excellent pay. But if CEOs were really interested
in being paid for performance, then all stock options would be
indexed to the performance of the S&AMP;P 500, and when companies did
badly CEOs would have to take pay cuts.
</P>
<P>
   More to the point, the success of companies like Daimler,
Bertelsmann, and Toyota suggests that excellent corporate
performance is not dependent upon egregiously high CEO salaries.
There are things to admire about U.S.-style capitalism. But the
self-dealing that has sent CEO salaries through the roof is not one
of them.

 &HT;    Spray flu vaccine could be on market by 1999
 &HT;    By Dick Stanley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Fifteen thousand children in Temple_ almost a
third of the Central Texas city's population _ are being recruited
for the largest study ever of a promising flu vaccine that is
misted up the nose rather than injected with a needle.
</P>
<P>
   Texas researchers leading the $3 million study by the National
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which begins Monday,
are seeking Temple children age 18 months through 18 years for each
winter influenza season through 2001. The viral disease usually
strikes from November through March, but the vaccine must be given
early to be effective.
</P>
<P>
   Dubbed FluMist by Aviron, the California biopharmaceutical
company that makes it, the vaccine showed 93 percent effectiveness
against the flu in a previous, smaller study.
</P>
<P>
   It may even help protect Temple adults from the annual virus,
said study leader Dr. W. Paul Glezen, an epidemiologist at the
Influenza Research Center of Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the nasal-spray flu vaccine is effective in our study
participants,'' Glezen said, ``they will be less likely to spread
influenza to their parents, which means fewer adults should be
exposed to flu viruses.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrea Coffee of Temple, which has a population of about 47,000
people, said she has enrolled her daughter Tristan in the study
because of day care and its inevitable infections. Tristan, 20
months old, goes to day care this fall for the first time, where
she will mingle with many other children and their associated
microbes. Most children get influenza two or three times by age5.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything I can do to protect her against infections will help
her and me,'' said Coffee, a pharmacist at Scott and White Hospital
and Clinic in Temple, where the study will be conducted by
researchers from Scott and White, Baylor and the Texas Department
of Health in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Coffee isn't just concerned about the flu, but also about the
painful ear infections it often inspires. They afflict about 80
percent of children at least once by age 3 and, for about half of
them, three or more times.
</P>
<P>
   In the previous study of the spray in 1,600 children, age 1
through 6, in Houston and at eight other sites around the country,
it was shown to be 98 percent effective against associated ear
infections.
</P>
<P>
   Viral infections such as flu often are the stimulus for ear
infections, swelling the eustachian tubes of the ears and trapping
fluid near the middle ear.
</P>
<P>
   Bacteria in the fluid multiply, causing further swelling and
pain, which can take several doses of antibiotics and a week or
more to cure.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Temple study is planned to last three years, it
could end sooner.
</P>
<P>
   Aviron, which submitted the vaccine in June for approval by the
Food and Drug Administration, hopes to have FluMist approved for
sale in time for the 1999 flu season.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Pedro Piedra, a pediatrician at Baylor College of Medicine
who co-authored a report on the previous study in the May 14 issue
of The New England Journal of Medicine, said the spray should be
more appealing to children and their parents because it is not a
shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many children who fear the pain of a shot might be more
inclined to get vaccinated this way,'' said Piedra, a
co-investigator in the Temple study.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers plan to monitor the spray's effectiveness by
keeping track of the number of flu-related visits to Temple health
clinics.
</P>
<P>
   They'll compare those visits to flu-related clinic visits in
Austin, where the spray vaccine will not be available.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to helping children and their parents beat
influenza, scientists have another reason for hoping the Temple
study finds further evidence for the spray's effectiveness at
preventing ear infections.
</P>
<P>
   They'd like it to help slow down the development of bacteria
that are resistent to antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   Bacterial resistance to front-line antibiotics is increasing
around the world, primarily in hospitals, raising fears that the
infectious bugs once so easily conquered may not be in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Because ear infections can be hard to treat, more anti biotics
than usual may be used, enhancing the rates at which some bacteria
develop resistance to the drugs.

 &HT;    COLUMN: Can't recycle those jokes any more
 &HT;    By John Kelso
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ I'm a little upset at Mike Barnicle, the Boston
Globe's tough-guy columnist who got suspended for two months for
stealing jokes from George Carlin.
</P>
<P>
   Couldn't he have ripped off somebody a little less prominent,
like, say, Judy Tenuta? No wonder he got busted. Borrowing from
Carlin would be like stealing material from Moses and expecting to
get away with it.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, this sets a horrible precedent. If Barnicle can get
himself sent home without pay for lifting jokes, the same thing
could happen to the rest of us columnists.
</P>
<P>
   The guy owes me an apology. Originally, I had intended to pass
off some of this material from David Letterman's top 10 list of
things the Pope has done to make himself look cool.
</P>
<P>
   My favorite one was No. 6 _ ``changed his name to Notorious
P.O.P.E.''
</P>
<P>
   I was going to lift that and share it with you. But thanks to
Barnicle, I can't. I hope he's happy.
</P>
<P>
   In defense of Barnicle, according to Time he said he got the
jokes that sounded like Carlin's from a bartender friend.
</P>
<P>
   I think I know this bartender. After a couple of drinks, he
tells everybody he's the hippie-dippy weatherman.
</P>
<P>
   The Aug. 2 column that got Barnicle in trouble included
one-liners that sounded similar to some of Carlin's stuff from his
1997 best-selling book, ``Brain Droppings.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, Carlin's joke was, ``Someday I wanna see the Pope
come out on that balcony and give the football scores.'' On the
other hand, Barnicle wrote, ``Someday I'd love to see the Pope
appear on his balcony and give the baseball scores.''
</P>
<P>
   So why the big stink? Barnicle rewrote this joke to make it
timely for baseball season.
</P>
<P>
   Which reminds me. Why did the chicken cross the road? He was
trying to hide from the publisher for lifting material and putting
it in the paper.
</P>
<P>
   What really irritates me about Barnicle, though, is that I doubt
he's using his real name.
</P>
<P>
   That's a little too convenient, being a columnist from Boston
named Barnicle. If some guy writing for a Boston newspaper told me
his name was Samuel T. Scrod, I wouldn't believe that one, either.
</P>
<P>
   But back to my original premise. As I stated earlier, until I
got sidetracked by a chronic case of smarty-pantsitis, I'm a bit
miffed because now I can't lift jokes off the Internet without
figuring out where they came from, thanks to Mr. Barnicle.
</P>
<P>
   For example, this guy was walking past the laughing academy when
he heard the people inside the fence chanting, ``Thirteen.
Thirteen. Thirteen.''
</P>
<P>
   Curious to find out what it meant, the guy looked through a
small knothole in the fence, when someone poked him square in the
eye.
</P>
<P>
   After which the happy chant went up, ``Fourteen. Fourteen.
Fourteen.''
</P>
<P>
   A friend sent me an e-mail with that joke. And I had hoped to
tell it to you. But I can't since I have no clue who wrote it. But
don't blame me. Blame Mike Barnicle. Then again, maybe I stole it
from him. After he got it from the bartender.

 &HT;    COLUMN: That could happen to my kid
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Four teens killed in a fiery wreck, racing on a
country road. Hump-hopping, they call it.
</P>
<P>
   These tragedies never feel like just another headline. They hit
us hard. All that promise, lost in an instant. I used to think,
``That could have happened to me or my friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Now I think, ``That could happen to my kid.''
</P>
<P>
   The thing I hate most about being a parent is the 24-hour-a-day
fear that something could happen. That you could hear the news
three sets of parents heard early Tuesday morning. That you could
change 6,000 diapers, fix 8,000 macaroni-and-cheese dinners,
deliver 10,000 look-both-ways lectures, and still your child could
be taken away from you in a single moment. No matter how vigilant
you are, your child could steal the car keys, sneak away in the
middle of the night and test that exhilarating sense of immortality
against a treacherous dip in the road, never imagining he might
lose.
</P>
<P>
   My youth was hardly wild and reckless, but my mother still
worried, still lectured about my going to a rock concert or driving
too late at night. I chafed. She countered, ``I've invested 18
years in you.''
</P>
<P>
   I responded with all proper dignity and indignation: ``I am not
an investment.''
</P>
<P>
   But of course children are an investment, of the most precious
and irreplaceable kind.
</P>
<P>
   Once you become a parent, whatever was your worst fear becomes
your second-worst fear. Rape, murder, fire, plane crash, lightning
striking: you would a thousand times rather it happen to you than
to one of your children.
</P>
<P>
   It's as if there's this little man on duty, inside your head. He
never sleeps, never takes a coffee break. You can keep him locked
up in the attic, but you can never banish him.
</P>
<P>
   Pick up Thursday's paper, and he's in the front room, banging on
the pots and pans. Three-year-old girl dies in Springfield blaze.
Sister, 13, accused in accidental shooting of brother. Service held
in Utah for five girls who accidentally lock themselves in car
trunk.
</P>
<P>
   You want to scream. You never want to read the paper, or turn on
the TV news, again. And you feel guilty: Is this pain for the
victims and their families, or how vulnerable you feel?
</P>
<P>
   You lock the little man in the attic again, keep your fears in
check, or you'll drive yourself _ and your kids _ crazy. You
constantly strive for the right balance between prudence and
paranoia, caution and confinement. If your kids are to grow into
true adulthood, you must balance your fear with the need to let
them take some risks, make some mistakes. You must give them more
and more freedom.
</P>
<P>
   When we talk about the decision to have another child, our
questions are pragmatic: Can we afford it? Do we have the time and
energy? Secretly I worry about emotional risk, about whether my
heart can bear the weight of one more little person I couldn't live
without. How can I bring a child into the world if I can't promise
he will make it safely to adulthood?
</P>
<P>
   Children have never come with any such guarantee. Parenthood is
a brave and foolish venture, where you play the odds every day, and
there's no such thing as risk-free investing.
</P>
<P>
   Stock prices rise and fall; one day you gain, the next day you
lose. Children are an investment of the soul. What you lose can
never be regained.

 &HT;    GMC's Savana a full-sized alternative to minivans
 &HT;    By Linda Sharp
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When auto experts talk about ``alternative'' vehicles,
they are usually referring to those powered by natural gas or
electricity.
</P>
<P>
   But you might also consider a nontraditional vehicle as an
alternative. When most families consider the purchase of a van,
their only consideration may be a minivan. The perception is it is
driver- and parking-lot-friendly. Few buyers would ever consider a
full-size van, but they may be missing a great opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   GMC totally redesigned its full-size van for the '98 model year.
The Savana went back to being a full-frame vehicle, and from a
driving standpoint, it shows perhaps the greatest improvement of
any GM product this year.
</P>
<P>
   The previous full-size GM van could be quite a handful. It
tended to sail its way down the highway, often requiring intense
concentration on the part of the driver just to keep it in its
proper lane.
</P>
<P>
   Another shortcoming of this vehicle was the placement of the
engine and driver in relation to the front wheels. The driver sat
up over the front wheels, and legroom was cramped. The engine
compartment protruded into the passenger cabin.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, it was not a package that was very user-friendly for
anything other than commercial applications.
</P>
<P>
   Enter the new Savana.
</P>
<P>
   The driver now sits on a flat floor, and the engine has been
moved out of the interior compartment, providing a large, flat
pass-through to rear seats and storage areas. Seating can
accommodate everything from a full-size family to the soccer team.
When equipped with two rear seats (a third is optional), there is
still ample storage inside the van for six bicycles, a host of
camping gear or a vacation's worth of luggage.
</P>
<P>
   This space provides more than just convenience. It keeps your
belongings out of the weather and does so securely.
</P>
<P>
   Many times I see minivans traveling with either rooftop carriers
or overloaded bicycle racks. Rooftop carriers pose two problems:
They tend to make vehicles top-heavy because most folks put too
much in them, and they cause incredible drag, eating up fuel
mileage. It might be more cost-effective to ship your luggage ahead
than to pay the additional fuel costs. Bicycle racks run the risk
of people walking into them and being injured, or your bicycling
finding its way to a new home while you're in a rest stop or
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   The Savana eliminates all these problems, and does it in a
vehicle that drives as comfortably as any minivan while providing
the safety benefits of a full-frame vehicle. Fuel mileage is not
far from that of minivans, and the biggest surprise may be that a
dressed-out Savana can be less expensive than a comparably dressed
minivan.

 &HT;    BMW roadster, M3 models bring prestigious series to a milestone
 &HT;    By Russ DeVault
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The German/American automaker BMW reaches a milestone
this month when the 100,000th of its ``brand within a brand''
M-Series vehicles comes off the assembly line at its Greer, S.C.,
plant. The car, a two-seat roadster, will be pulled aside, given
some commemorative trim and shipped to Jacksonville to be raffled
off this fall by the BMW Car Club.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing amazing about the number of M-Series cars built
in South Carolina and Germany. The high-performance cars given the
performance perks by BMW's racing-oriented Motorsports division are
coveted by car buffs with deep pockets and by those who only dream
of owning one. What is astonishing is that BMW is allowing the
landmark M car to be built outside the fatherland.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were lucky to win the lottery of production,'' said Scott
Doniger, the New Jersey-based M brand manager. ``It happens to be
one of the roadsters (based on the Z3) targeted for the United
States market. It will be given some special trim and make some
appearances, including at the Petit LeMans race at Road Atlanta on
Oct. 10, before being raffled off in October by the 45,000-member
BMW Car Club.''
</P>
<P>
   No big deal is scheduled at the plant, although recognition will
be given the employees who complete the roadster, which would carry
a sticker of $43,340 if it joined its siblings in showrooms.
Instead, it will go into a special niche in the history of the M
cars, which debuted in 1978 when the mid-engined M1 sports car, a
277-horsepower rocket priced at about $60,000, was spun off from
the M1 race car.
</P>
<P>
   That 160-mph M1 has been followed by various M6, M5 and M3
machines, with some of the M6s from the 1980s now considered
collector cars. The offerings this model year include the Z3-based
M roadster, the M3 sedan ($40,840), the M3 coupe ($40,840) and the
M3 convertible ($47,040). All are powered by an ultra-responsive
3.2-liter six-cylinder engine, which makes 240 hp at 6,000 rpm and
has a broad torque range that peaks at 236 feet-pounds at 3,800
rpm.
</P>
<P>
   All also are image cars, both for BMW and their owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``BMWs are performance cars, and the M cars are the epitome of
our performance,'' brand manager Doniger says. ``People who buy
them include racing enthusiasts and people who take driving
programs. They're 70-75 percent male, very well educated and
modest, but with pretty high incomes. These are active people who
are very involved with cars. They don't sit around watching
television.''
</P>
<P>
   These are cars that beg to be driven, causing drivers to look
for errands to run and the long way home. The roadster, a logical
extension of the Z3, and the M3 cars, despite some having four
doors, clearly qualify as sports cars.
</P>
<P>
   Neither is overly large, nor will they take on much cargo. The
interiors and layouts are functional, but not particularly
luxurious or striking. Power tops and leather seating are standard
on both, and Harmon Kardon stereos with enough power to negate the
noise inherent with top-down driving are available.
</P>
<P>
   Safety considerations include the usual front air bags, with the
M3 cars adding side bags (optional on the roadster). The drop-tops
have roll-over protection systems, and all have seat belts that
give occupants a real belted-in feeling. Crisp steering, near 50-50
front-rear weight distribution, strong disc brakes and beefed-up
suspensions make both the roadster and the M3s remarkably
maneuverable.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the roadster's size _ or lack of it _ means it's not a
car that inspires comfort and security going wheel-to-wheel with
large cars and trucks on expressways and interstates. The
3,100-pound roadster is 158.5 inches long and 68.5 inches wide,
making it about an inch wider than the M3s, which are 174.5 inches
nose to tail.
</P>
<P>
   Get them out of the mainstream, however, and the roadster and
all three M3 machines really come into their own. BMW credits both
with 0-to-60 mph times of five-plus seconds, so acceleration is not
a problem. Clutches and shifters have solid, no-nonsense feels, and
a five-speed automatic transmission ($1,200) is available on the M3
sedan and convertible for those who don't care for the five-speed
manual that's standard on both cars.
</P>
<P>
   With its top up, the roadster has almost as much headroom (37.6
inches) as the M3s, and both have 41-plus inches of legroom. Both
have the usual wretched visibility of most convertibles and the
plastic covering of the instrumentation can generate glare that
makes it difficult to read the gauges and speedometers. The
leather-and-plastic interiors hold heat, and neither the roadster
nor the M3 air conditioner had enough strength to cope immediately
with this summer's 90-degree weather.
</P>
<P>
   Major controls are easily reached and operated. The
stalk-mounted levers are conveniently placed for finger-flicking
operation even by drivers who routinely keep both hands on the
steering wheel, which both cars encourage because of the erect
posture mandated by the seating and their fun-to-drive natures.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of a drive in the roadster or the 3-Series variants,
fun is what will stand out. BMW can talk about image, and some
owners may be lured by the status that comes with
limited-production cars, but the M roadster and the M3 convertible,
coupe and sedan are best appreciated by drivers who relish feeling
connected to the machine and the road under them.

 &HT;    Octane choice a vital decision for all
 &HT;    By Nora Carter
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Adhering to the manufacturer's specification for fuel
octane is not a condition limited to the owners of ``high
performance'' vehicles. It is just as important for the rest of us
to heed the octane requirements of the cars we drive.
</P>
<P>
   So what do we do when our owners manuals have long ago
disappeared? How do we determine which gas to stick in our tank at
the pump?
</P>
<P>
   Finding the best gas for the vehicle you drive is often a
condition of trial and error and compromise. This could involve
trying different brands of gasoline or different octanes of those
brands. The objective is to get the best performance and mileage
from your vehicle without wasting money on octane you don't need or
use, keeping in mind that ``marbles rattling in the can'' sound
(engine ping) is what you don't want.
</P>
<P>
   Outside of the manufacturer's specifications, other conditions
affect fuel the octane requirement for your vehicle:
</P>
<P>
   _ Driving habits, both how you drive and where you drive.
</P>
<P>
   Driver type 1: You spend most of your time in stop-and-go
traffic and taking short trips. Your accelerator pedal is rarely
depressed past mid- to three-quarter throttle and sees the floor
only in an emergency, the expressway on-ramp or when you're really
mad. Expressway trips are mostly mid-throttle.
</P>
<P>
   These driving conditions call for regular, 87 octane fuel with
an occasional (maybe once every fourth fill) tank of 89 octane
mid-grade. The only reason I mention the mid-grade is because it
usually contains more detergent additive than regular fuel and will
help minimize engine deposits. A gasoline with a higher RON number
(the R in R+M/2 on the pump) would be ideal.
</P>
<P>
   Driver type 2: Same driving conditions as above, except you're
more aggressive with the throttle, tempering the rapid acceleration
with the brake pedal. You prefer the left lane of the expressway.
I'd shop around the 89 octane market for starters. (The higher the
M number in R+M/2 on the pump.) If it pings, you need to pay the
big bucks for premium.
</P>
<P>
   _ Vehicle condition, age and maintenance (or lack of).
</P>
<P>
   Older, basic transportation vehicles that receive minimal
maintenance may actually require a higher octane fuel. Neglected
cooling systems, carbon buildup in the combustion chamber, and
marginal or nonfunctioning emission control systems can cause an
engine to run hotter. Although premium fuel helps eliminate the
pinging caused by any of these conditions, it is merely covering
the source of the problems.
</P>
<P>
   Older vehicles that are well maintained may also ping on lower
octane fuel. Carbon deposits accumulate in the combustion chamber
over a period of time and miles. Emission control systems, which
quite frankly have no maintenance intervals, quit working
correctly. Both of these conditions are repairable without taking
out a bank loan. The reimbursements are the ability to use lower
octane fuel once again.
</P>
<P>
   Always buy high-quality fuel from a major distributor. Cheap gas
leads to problems too numerous to list.

 &HT;    Woodworkers fair in Atlanta
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For woodworkers with boundless energy and an
overwhelming interest in equipment, the International Woodworking
Machinery and Furniture Supply Fair is almost upon us. It opens
Thursday in Atlanta at the Georgia World Congress Center and runs
through Aug. 23.
</P>
<P>
   Every woodworker ought to go to this thing at least once, even
if it does cost $20 to get in.
</P>
<P>
   It used to offer very little for the home or small shop
woodworker, but that's no longer the case. Now there's something
for everybody.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly it makes the little woodworker's show that comes
around once a year look like a one-dog and one-pony show.
</P>
<P>
   It's also interesting to see the vast machines intended for
furniture factories. Interesting, but not inspiring.
</P>
<P>
   This is an enormous show, and it has become too physically
exhausting for me to deal with unless there is an extremely
compelling reason, such as seeing old friends.
</P>
<P>
   It's generally divided into two rooms, or caverns, one for
machinery and the other for things that make little or no noise.
</P>
<P>
   The noise level is so high in the machinery section that
conversation is virtually impossible. If I were going again, I'd
wear ear plugs. I can't imagine how the vendors who spend four days
in that place can stand it.
</P>
<P>
   Every booth where stuff can be purchased and carried out by
hand, or by hand truck, has its show specials. Be careful of these
_ they aren't always special at all.
</P>
<P>
   For people who've been there and done that, Highland Hardware is
bringing Roy Underhill, star of the PBS show ``The Woodwright's
Shop,'' to town the same weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The store, of course, will have its usual major booth at the
show, but back on Highland Avenue, Underhill will be demonstrating
his Colonial tools and techniques all day Thursday, Friday and
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 23 he'll be in the Tage Frid seminar room conducting a
workshop for paying observers.
</P>
<P>
   Store owner Chris Bagby promises that Underhill will ``fell a
tree before your eyes, and proceed to hew it, rive it, shave it and
shape it in authentic Colonial style.'' Seeing a tree felled in the
seminar room ought to be worth the price of admission.
</P>
<P>
   So next weekend you can pay your money and take your choice: go
to the fair and wreck yourself, or sit in the seminar room in
comfort and watch Underhill get all the exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Call the store at 404-872-4466 for more information, and take a
look at the fall seminar lineup on the Internet at
www.highland-hardware.com. I'll try to bring you more information
on the other seminars next week.

 &HT;    COLUMN: Can't recycle those jokes any more
 &HT;    By John Kelso
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ I'm a little upset at Mike Barnicle, the Boston
Globe's tough-guy columnist who got suspended for two months for
stealing jokes from George Carlin.
</P>
<P>
   Couldn't he have ripped off somebody a little less prominent,
like, say, Judy Tenuta? No wonder he got busted. Borrowing from
Carlin would be like stealing material from Moses and expecting to
get away with it.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, this sets a horrible precedent. If Barnicle can get
himself sent home without pay for lifting jokes, the same thing
could happen to the rest of us columnists.
</P>
<P>
   The guy owes me an apology. Originally, I had intended to pass
off some of this material from David Letterman's top 10 list of
things the Pope has done to make himself look cool.
</P>
<P>
   My favorite one was No. 6 _ ``changed his name to Notorious
P.O.P.E.''
</P>
<P>
   I was going to lift that and share it with you. But thanks to
Barnicle, I can't. I hope he's happy.
</P>
<P>
   In defense of Barnicle, according to Time he said he got the
jokes that sounded like Carlin's from a bartender friend.
</P>
<P>
   I think I know this bartender. After a couple of drinks, he
tells everybody he's the hippie-dippy weatherman.
</P>
<P>
   The Aug. 2 column that got Barnicle in trouble included
one-liners that sounded similar to some of Carlin's stuff from his
1997 best-selling book, ``Brain Droppings.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, Carlin's joke was, ``Someday I wanna see the Pope
come out on that balcony and give the football scores.'' On the
other hand, Barnicle wrote, ``Someday I'd love to see the Pope
appear on his balcony and give the baseball scores.''
</P>
<P>
   So why the big stink? Barnicle rewrote this joke to make it
timely for baseball season.
</P>
<P>
   Which reminds me. Why did the chicken cross the road? He was
trying to hide from the publisher for lifting material and putting
it in the paper.
</P>
<P>
   What really irritates me about Barnicle, though, is that I doubt
he's using his real name.
</P>
<P>
   That's a little too convenient, being a columnist from Boston
named Barnicle. If some guy writing for a Boston newspaper told me
his name was Samuel T. Scrod, I wouldn't believe that one, either.
</P>
<P>
   But back to my original premise. As I stated earlier, until I
got sidetracked by a chronic case of smarty-pantsitis, I'm a bit
miffed because now I can't lift jokes off the Internet without
figuring out where they came from, thanks to Mr. Barnicle.
</P>
<P>
   For example, this guy was walking past the laughing academy when
he heard the people inside the fence chanting, ``Thirteen.
Thirteen. Thirteen.''
</P>
<P>
   Curious to find out what it meant, the guy looked through a
small knothole in the fence, when someone poked him square in the
eye.
</P>
<P>
   After which the happy chant went up, ``Fourteen. Fourteen.
Fourteen.''
</P>
<P>
   A friend sent me an e-mail with that joke. And I had hoped to
tell it to you. But I can't since I have no clue who wrote it. But
don't blame me. Blame Mike Barnicle. Then again, maybe I stole it
from him. After he got it from the bartender.

 &HT;    COLUMN: That could happen to my kid
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Four teens killed in a fiery wreck, racing on a
country road. Hump-hopping, they call it.
</P>
<P>
   These tragedies never feel like just another headline. They hit
us hard. All that promise, lost in an instant. I used to think,
``That could have happened to me or my friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Now I think, ``That could happen to my kid.''
</P>
<P>
   The thing I hate most about being a parent is the 24-hour-a-day
fear that something could happen. That you could hear the news
three sets of parents heard early Tuesday morning. That you could
change 6,000 diapers, fix 8,000 macaroni-and-cheese dinners,
deliver 10,000 look-both-ways lectures, and still your child could
be taken away from you in a single moment. No matter how vigilant
you are, your child could steal the car keys, sneak away in the
middle of the night and test that exhilarating sense of immortality
against a treacherous dip in the road, never imagining he might
lose.
</P>
<P>
   My youth was hardly wild and reckless, but my mother still
worried, still lectured about my going to a rock concert or driving
too late at night. I chafed. She countered, ``I've invested 18
years in you.''
</P>
<P>
   I responded with all proper dignity and indignation: ``I am not
an investment.''
</P>
<P>
   But of course children are an investment, of the most precious
and irreplaceable kind.
</P>
<P>
   Once you become a parent, whatever was your worst fear becomes
your second-worst fear. Rape, murder, fire, plane crash, lightning
striking: you would a thousand times rather it happen to you than
to one of your children.
</P>
<P>
   It's as if there's this little man on duty, inside your head. He
never sleeps, never takes a coffee break. You can keep him locked
up in the attic, but you can never banish him.
</P>
<P>
   Pick up Thursday's paper, and he's in the front room, banging on
the pots and pans. Three-year-old girl dies in Springfield blaze.
Sister, 13, accused in accidental shooting of brother. Service held
in Utah for five girls who accidentally lock themselves in car
trunk.
</P>
<P>
   You want to scream. You never want to read the paper, or turn on
the TV news, again. And you feel guilty: Is this pain for the
victims and their families, or how vulnerable you feel?
</P>
<P>
   You lock the little man in the attic again, keep your fears in
check, or you'll drive yourself _ and your kids _ crazy. You
constantly strive for the right balance between prudence and
paranoia, caution and confinement. If your kids are to grow into
true adulthood, you must balance your fear with the need to let
them take some risks, make some mistakes. You must give them more
and more freedom.
</P>
<P>
   When we talk about the decision to have another child, our
questions are pragmatic: Can we afford it? Do we have the time and
energy? Secretly I worry about emotional risk, about whether my
heart can bear the weight of one more little person I couldn't live
without. How can I bring a child into the world if I can't promise
he will make it safely to adulthood?
</P>
<P>
   Children have never come with any such guarantee. Parenthood is
a brave and foolish venture, where you play the odds every day, and
there's no such thing as risk-free investing.
</P>
<P>
   Stock prices rise and fall; one day you gain, the next day you
lose. Children are an investment of the soul. What you lose can
never be regained.

 &HT;    COLUMN: Roughing it in style
 &HT;    By Jim Minter
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUNGRY HORSE, Mont. _ Our friends Alex and Judy Moye, who reside
on the affluent Northside of Fayetteville, Ga., are world
travelers. Having dinner with them at their home about a year ago,
I remarked that I had just finished reading Stephen Ambrose's book
about the Lewis and Clark exploration of the Northwest commissioned
by President Thomas Jefferson.
</P>
<P>
   I added a brief editorial comment suggesting it would be an
interesting adventure to retrace their route from St. Louis to the
Pacific Ocean. I forgot to add that I never venture north of Harp's
Crossing or south of Woolsey on my own volition.
</P>
<P>
   Late one afternoon last month I came in from the garden to
discover my wife in a state of ecstasy. ``Guess what?'' she
announced. ``Alex and Judy have invited us to go with them on a
trip retracing the Lewis and Clark expedition!''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's very nice of them,'' I replied, ``but that would take a
good part of the summer and we can't afford to be gone when the
figs are ripening and all the stuff I planted in the garden is
coming in.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't think of a better reason to be gone,'' she answered.
``Just give me two good reasons why we shouldn't go.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can think of one,'' I replied. ``We can't afford it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why we need to go,'' she countered. ``Besides getting
to ride practically free in their motor home, Alex has a Golden
Eagle Senior Citizen pass that will get us into national parks
without having to pay. You better accept their offer. At your age
you probably won't get another chance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know you were so concerned about my age,'' I said.
``Is that the reason you've quit buying green bananas?''
</P>
<P>
   As usual, we reached a compromise. We decided to make the trip
and let the garden go to pot. Alex and Judy invited us back to
their Northside Fayetteville home to finalize plans. I was alarmed
when I got a look at the motor home parked on the south half of the
Moye homestead. It is only slightly smaller than an L-1011 jumbo
jet. Being a former Eastern Airlines captain, Alex likes
navigational challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alex,'' I asked. ``Do you think it's legal to have all that on
the road?'' He assured me it was, which didn't keep me from
checking with the Department of Transportation in Washington. After
listening to my description of the Moye rig, the person answering
the phone in Washington said it would be legal as long as we didn't
drive in small states like Vermont and Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   Because of upcoming end-of-summer sales at Neiman Marcus and
Saks, we decided to limit our trip to two weeks. We flew to Rapid
City, S.D., where the Moyes met us in the towed vehicle and
transported us into the Badlands. The Badlands are a collection of
eroding hills holding the earth together while sustaining a few
leftover buffalo and a handful of Indians.
</P>
<P>
   When we stopped for refreshment a weathered old gentleman, a
Northern Baptist, explained how the Badlands came to be. He said
God was working on Saturday afternoon putting the place in order
when he remembered he'd made a bad oversight. Being able to see
into the future, he knew about the coming automobile age. Realizing
he had forgotten to make a back-seat driver, he dropped what he was
doing and rushed back to the Garden of Eden, where he swiped a rib
from Adam and made Eve. Being worn out from a hard week's work, he
never got around to finishing his job in South Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   I pass the story on for what it's worth. Some of the old-timers
out here are bad to tell lies when the audience is a tenderfoot
from back East.
</P>
<P>
   We dropped in on the Wall Drug Store in Wall, S.D. The Wall Drug
Store was about to go under in the 1930s when Mrs. Wall got the
bright idea of advertising free ice water for thirsty travelers.
Now it's bigger than Gatlinburg, Tenn., and offers all sorts of
gadgets and gimmicks Ron and Pam Pendergraft might consider for
their drugstore in Fayetteville in case the Viagra market drops
off. We visited Little Big Horn, where the Indians wiped out Lt.
Col. Custer and his U.S. cavalry troop, an event that, as Lewis
Grizzard frequently pointed out, was not universally mourned in the
states of the old Confederacy. We drove 350 miles in the towed
vehicle to see Old Faithful belch in Yellowstone Park and 75 miles
to get fingernails repaired in the only nail salon in the Northwest
Territory, located between Hungry Horse and Whitefish.
</P>
<P>
   Although I worry about all the figs and tomatoes going to waste
back home, I think the trip has so far been successful, with one
exception. The female members of the party haven't located a
shopping mall to match Lenox Square and Phipps. But then Lewis and
Clark didn't find everything they were looking for either.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: The making of 'Starrfeld'
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``So, ahem, is this a subpoena for us, Mr. Starr?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, no, sirs. It's a script for a TV pilot. I've come to you
to ask for the $40 million I need to get it on the air as a network
series.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Forty million. Who do you think we are? Congress? You could
build a dozen elementary schools with that. You could make giant
scientific advances for our industry, like cloning George
Clooney.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Indeed, Mr. Starr. This had better be good. For that money, we
should have the next 'Perry Mason' in our hands. So, how did you
arrive at the premise for this show?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, we set out to make it about an investigation into
fraudulent land deals. Then we tried to make it about intrigue
involving shredded documents and even a homicide, and, yada yada
yada, we came up with this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it's about sex, and lies and cheating among people in
business attire.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, like 'Ally McBeal.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not exactly. It's about the all-points pursuit of one man
accused...''
</P>
<P>
   ``Of espionage, hiring hitmen?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Accused of sneaking around on his wife.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So, it's 'The Fugitive' without a murder.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be up to his wife. But we don't need a homicide to
make this must-see TV. This is the '90s.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still not clear. You expect to get something long-running
out of this?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You bet. We do by examining every piddling detail of his life
_ what he's read, what he eats, what gifts he gives. One by one, we
meet all the women in his past or those believed to be his lady
friends. It we stay focused on his trail of piddle, we can be into
our fourth season without any loss of viewership.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, the 'Seinfeld' formula. A show about nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And where is the show set?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, we started out in Little Rock...''
</P>
<P>
   ``I see. A Southern theme, like 'Designing Women,' only with
corn-cob pipes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But we moved it to D.C. Far more appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And in Washington there's far more dirt.''
</P>
<P>
   ``More dirt. And a lot more effluent. And even though there are
big issues that affect millions of people's lives, like Medicare,
Social Security, the national debt, education and more, there's no
doubt what matters most to the viewing public.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What's that?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Effluent, of course. So in this case we're going to focus on
dirty little secrets. And if we can find even one, we'll hold our
noses and focus on that with an electron microscope.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you really think people would make the private life of one
person such a fixation?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd stake my job on it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have something, here. With 'Jerry Springer,' with
'Jenny Jones', and various mutations, viewers have shown a
remarkable desire to delve into matters once pondered only by sewer
vermin.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's right. For a profound medium, television has explored
new frontiers in nauseam.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's right. It's shown us the moon landing. It's also shown
us wife-swapping Siamese twins.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, all right, Mr. Starr. So we have a show. It had better
be good for the money you'll have spent.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, it'll be good. As for those people who are saying it's
about nothing, or 'it's about sex,' well, sex isn't nothing. In
terms of the marketplace, I'm sure you'd agree. It's everything.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still not sure you could take one person's personal life
and build an entire production around it and not have a dead body
somewhere in the mix.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, we had one in there for a while. For another $40
million, maybe we could dredge a few canals.''

 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ When Sharon Kahn started writing fiction again,
it was with a sense of urgency.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother was in her 70s when she tried to do some writing,''
Kahn said quietly. ``She'd always wanted to write a book. And she
didn't make it.''
</P>
<P>
   Most afternoons Kahn sits on the red-and-white-figured couch in
her Austin living room with her cat, Alpie, and writes for four or
five hours on a laptop computer. Mornings, she spends doing water
aerobics, running errands and playing with her grandchildren. She
just turned 64.
</P>
<P>
   What separates her from other Austin grandmothers typing novels
in their living rooms is that Simon &AMP; Schuster just published her
book. It's been named a Book of the Month Club Alternate Selection,
and she'll go on an East Coast/West Coast book tour in the fall.
Last week she saw her book on display in an Austin bookstore for
the first time: ``Fax Me a Bagel: A Ruby the Rabbi's Wife Mystery''
by Sharon Kahn.
</P>
<P>
   It's not the literary novel she started out to write, the
historical one about how her family fought the Klan in Birmingham,
Ala. That was her mother's story, and it stalled out. But this one,
this mystery, was fun and easy to write because it's almost her own
story. For 31 years, Kahn was a rabbi's wife. She never was a
sleuth like Ruby _ never had her nerve _ but they have other things
in common.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ruby's independent, as I was,'' Kahn says. ``It was an
interesting way of life, but it took a sense of humor to get
through it.''
</P>
<P>
   She's wearing a simple black dress, and you can't help but think
of Ruby in the book, ``dressed in my tried-and-true basic black.''
That's in the second chapter, where Ruby is on her way to a funeral
for the murder victim, a member of the congregation who dropped
dead before her eyes in a bagel shop.
</P>
<P>
   As the title hints, ``Fax Me a Bagel'' is funny, often
irreverent. It's the first in a series featuring 46-year-old,
red-haired Ruby Rothman, a rabbi's widow in Eternal, Texas, south
of Austin. Her adventures continue in ``Never Nosh a Matzo Ball,''
due out next year. ``She's going to stay the same age at first,''
Kahn says. ``Later, she's going to age very slowly.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruby first appears in ``Fax Me a Bagel'' wearing torn cutoffs
and a ``Born to Bake'' T-shirt her son gave her as a joke. She's
hoping not to run into anybody from the congregation, so, of
course, she meets the most annoying woman in it, ``dressed in a
white silk suit untouched by human hands.'' (Her bland sister is
the one who dies.)
</P>
<P>
   What makes Kahn's book fun to read are the characters and Ruby's
offhand comments about life in the congregation. Walking through
the temple she thinks: ``I'm late. The Kaufman clock with the
gilded Hebrew numbers is just chiming eight. ... I hang my jacket
in the Goldberg cloakroom, just off the Blumberg social hall.
Jewish fund-raising is not nameless.''
</P>
<P>
   It's been 10 years since Kahn was a rabbi's wife. They divorced.
The rabbi is in Tucson, Ariz.; she moved here five years ago to be
near her children who were studying at the University of Texas. She
doesn't talk about the divorce.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came of age in the '50s, and when I graduated from Vassar
nobody expected to do much besides marriage,'' she said. I married
at 23 and thought that was old. In Birmingham, it was. After
college I was married and had three kids and had the profession of
being a rabbi's wife. I really didn't come up for air until I was
about 40 years old and decided to go to law school.''
</P>
<P>
   Law school?
</P>
<P>
   Kahn explains matter-of-factly that she graduated from the
University of Arizona Law School and practiced for 17 years, much
of that time as a labor management arbitrator, traveling all over
the West. If it was hard doing that, she doesn't make too much of
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm taking a vacation now from the more serious job of
labor arbitration, where you were able to get people's jobs back,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Two of her children, both social workers, live in Austin. On
visits to them in years past she learned about the Austin Writers'
League and joined; she later joined Sisters in Crime. The day she
moved here she attended a seminar at the league that led her to a
critique group, the same one that nurtured mystery writer and UT
sorority housemother Nancy Bell. Kahn won the league's Teddy Award
for children's fiction for ``Kacy and the Space Shuttle Secret,''
published by Eakin Press in 1996. Last year she and Ruthe
Winegarten co-authored ``Brave Black Women,'' published by UT
Press.
</P>
<P>
   Kahn continues to work on literary fiction, as she first did
decades ago at Vassar. She says she still may write her mother's
book, or some form of it. The taste for mysteries came from her
father, who owned a men's wear store in Birmingham next door to the
police station. ``We listened to 'Gang Busters' together on the
radio, and when I was 8 he gave me a mystery game which included
glossy photos of crime scenes.''
</P>
<P>
   Ours was Sharon Kahn's first interview, she said, and she did
turn over a pitcher of iced tea as it began. But other than that,
she seems pretty calm about what looks like an exciting year ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (anything that happens with the Ruby mysteries) is a
bonus at this age. I had a successful career. I raised my kids.
Anything I do now is . . . well, I feel like the pressure's off,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe. Or maybe it's just starting up again. ``Ruby's
independent, as I was. It was an interesting way of life, but it
took a sense of humor to get through it.''

 &HT;    Guy-next-door rocker is floating some of the season's hottest
air time
 &HT;    By Chris Riemenschneider
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ If '90s rock heroes had to play the parts of
``Sesame Street'' characters, Billy Corgan's baldness and bleakness
would make him the Count, Courtney Love's yellowy makeover and
annoying cackle would fit Big Bird, and Kurt Cobain and Eddie
Vedder could pass for Oscar the Grouch. All that would be left for
Dave Matthews, then, is Ernie.
</P>
<P>
   An unlikely rock star if ever there was one, Matthews has
nonetheless stumbled dumbfounded into the ranks of '90s pop-culture
sensations. His record-sales figures have topped 11 million and
counting. MTV and radio stations across the country have played the
garbanzo beans out of his singles _ even the recent, hook-less
``Don't Drink the Water,'' which the 31-year-old singer agrees
isn't hit material.
</P>
<P>
   Concert-industry watchers, meanwhile, have declared the summer
of '98 his, as shows by the Dave Matthews Band are selling out with
Deadheadian regularity. And the desperately hip Spin magazine went
so far (or low, perhaps, from its readers' views) as to use the
words ``king of rock'' next to one of the most dopey, baffling
cover photos of recent memory: More startling than Matthews' queer
pose was the hairy belly-roll hanging out from his undersized
Banana Republic sweater.
</P>
<P>
   Raised a Quaker and bred on David Letterman-style,
self-deprecating humor, Matthews is the first to cut such hype down
to size.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a hard enough time reading or seeing things in the
media about me,'' he said recently, calling from a tour stop in
Hartford, Conn. ``But if and when I ever refer to something like
(the Spin article), it's with tongue firmly planted in cheek. How
else can I react, but by being a goof?''
</P>
<P>
   A goof. An everyman. A guy next door. A common dude with the Tom
Hanks sort of haircut and overbite to prove it. All are fitting
descriptions of this Charlottesville, Va.-based superstar, who has
dated the same hometown girl for five years and is among the
majority still a little perplexed by the so-called electronic music
revolution that every other major rocker is getting into.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what I listen to on the radio? `Car Talk,' ''
Matthews said, referring to the National Public Radio show led by
two mechanic brothers. ``I mean, I tell people I'm really an NPR
junkie, and they think, `Oh, Garrison Keillor?' No, Click and
Clack. My nose isn't up in the wind, man.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not that Matthews isn't a cultured guy. Having grown up in
South Africa and since traveled the world, he eats up foreign life
and customs. You should have heard his excitement over touring
Latin America for the first time this fall.
</P>
<P>
   And while Matthews' radio preferences may edge on motorhead, his
musical tastes are hardly Motrhead. The one thing Matthews takes
seriously _ so much so, you can hear a change in the tone of his
raspy, leathery voice whenever the subject comes up _ is music.
Especially Dave Matthews Band music, which its namesake is far
quicker to defend than critical jabs at his own person.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that really gets me,'' he said, in that tone, ``is
when critics write that we're too average, or too much a throwback.
I mean, I guess they think we're too much like all those other
(expletive) bands with a violin and saxophone as two of the main
instruments. I understand where the criticism comes from _ from the
fact that we like to jam in concert, but that is no reflection of a
lack of creativity in the band. All the jams in the world can't
make this band average.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, with Matthews' decisively quirky lyrics and throaty,
choppy vocal delivery, and the band's blink-less mix of jazz, twang
and rock influences, the DMB certainly deserves an objective look.
The band's newest album, ``Before These Crowded Streets,'' is the
hardest to categorize of all six, with a lawn-sprinkler sort of
approach to musical styles and a delivery that allows everyone from
Bela Fleck to the Kronos Quartet to Alanis Morissette to help with
the watering. This, from the band that already had non-fans
scratching their heads over songs like ``Ants Marching,'' ``What
Would You Say,'' ``Too Much'' and the sweet 1996 hit that made
Matthews something of a sex symbol, ``Crash Into Me.''
</P>
<P>
   There's more to the band's nonconformity than just music,
though, and certainly more to it than what violinist Boyd Tinsley
and saxophonist LeRoi Moore play on their instruments. Moore,
Tinsley and drummer Carter Beauford make up the group's black
majority, to Matthews and bassist Stefan Lessard's white minority.
An overboiled melting pot, you might call it. It's another
characteristic that makes the Dave Matthews Band all the more
unlikely of a pop-music sensation. Let's face it, such
multi-culturalism is often looked upon as dim-witted tokenism by
skeptical white and black audiences alike. Having spent his teen
years in an anti-apartheid South African household after moving
from upstate New York at age 13, Matthews said of the racial makeup
of the band: ``It's what I know. That's all.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not like he went out looking specifically for a few African
Americans when forming the Dave Matthews Band in 1991. He wasn't
even specifically seeking a violin or sax player.
</P>
<P>
   The would-be bandleader was tending bar at a now-legendary
Charlottesville hangout (Miller's) when he passed along a homemade
tape to Tinsley and Moore, local jazz and funk veterans. They
agreed to play on some demos. That studio work drew the attention
of Beauford and Lessard. Within a year, the DMB was a sensation
around the University of Virginia and ready to conquer other
college towns, with a style of music that even campus crowds
couldn't pin down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say our style fell into place immediately,''
Matthews said. ``But it was immediately obvious we should be able
to work out something pretty amazing together.''
</P>
<P>
   After six albums, seven years and a blur of success, Matthews
said he still finds the band that amazing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's a cliche, but we're like a family, right down to
our daily rituals,'' he said. ``When we're on tour, we all kind of
go off and do our own thing during the day, but each night, we have
our dinner time. We all come together on stage, and it's like we're
at the same table, eating the same meal.''
</P>
<P>
   As for his own, shall we say, ``kingly'' status, Matthews said,
``I was a high-school screw-up. I was such a screw-up, I know
there's people who knew me then that now can't believe I haven't
blown this yet.''

 &HT;    Spray flu vaccine could be on market by 1999
 &HT;    By Dick Stanley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Fifteen thousand children in Temple_ almost a
third of the Central Texas city's population _ are being recruited
for the largest study ever of a promising flu vaccine that is
misted up the nose rather than injected with a needle.
</P>
<P>
   Texas researchers leading the $3 million study by the National
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which begins Monday,
are seeking Temple children age 18 months through 18 years for each
winter influenza season through 2001. The viral disease usually
strikes from November through March, but the vaccine must be given
early to be effective.
</P>
<P>
   Dubbed FluMist by Aviron, the California biopharmaceutical
company that makes it, the vaccine showed 93 percent effectiveness
against the flu in a previous, smaller study.
</P>
<P>
   It may even help protect Temple adults from the annual virus,
said study leader Dr. W. Paul Glezen, an epidemiologist at the
Influenza Research Center of Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the nasal-spray flu vaccine is effective in our study
participants,'' Glezen said, ``they will be less likely to spread
influenza to their parents, which means fewer adults should be
exposed to flu viruses.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrea Coffee of Temple, which has a population of about 47,000
people, said she has enrolled her daughter Tristan in the study
because of day care and its inevitable infections. Tristan, 20
months old, goes to day care this fall for the first time, where
she will mingle with many other children and their associated
microbes. Most children get influenza two or three times by age5.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything I can do to protect her against infections will help
her and me,'' said Coffee, a pharmacist at Scott and White Hospital
and Clinic in Temple, where the study will be conducted by
researchers from Scott and White, Baylor and the Texas Department
of Health in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Coffee isn't just concerned about the flu, but also about the
painful ear infections it often inspires. They afflict about 80
percent of children at least once by age 3 and, for about half of
them, three or more times.
</P>
<P>
   In the previous study of the spray in 1,600 children, age 1
through 6, in Houston and at eight other sites around the country,
it was shown to be 98 percent effective against associated ear
infections.
</P>
<P>
   Viral infections such as flu often are the stimulus for ear
infections, swelling the eustachian tubes of the ears and trapping
fluid near the middle ear.
</P>
<P>
   Bacteria in the fluid multiply, causing further swelling and
pain, which can take several doses of antibiotics and a week or
more to cure.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Temple study is planned to last three years, it
could end sooner.
</P>
<P>
   Aviron, which submitted the vaccine in June for approval by the
Food and Drug Administration, hopes to have FluMist approved for
sale in time for the 1999 flu season.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Pedro Piedra, a pediatrician at Baylor College of Medicine
who co-authored a report on the previous study in the May 14 issue
of The New England Journal of Medicine, said the spray should be
more appealing to children and their parents because it is not a
shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many children who fear the pain of a shot might be more
inclined to get vaccinated this way,'' said Piedra, a
co-investigator in the Temple study.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers plan to monitor the spray's effectiveness by
keeping track of the number of flu-related visits to Temple health
clinics.
</P>
<P>
   They'll compare those visits to flu-related clinic visits in
Austin, where the spray vaccine will not be available.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to helping children and their parents beat
influenza, scientists have another reason for hoping the Temple
study finds further evidence for the spray's effectiveness at
preventing ear infections.
</P>
<P>
   They'd like it to help slow down the development of bacteria
that are resistent to antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   Bacterial resistance to front-line antibiotics is increasing
around the world, primarily in hospitals, raising fears that the
infectious bugs once so easily conquered may not be in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Because ear infections can be hard to treat, more anti biotics
than usual may be used, enhancing the rates at which some bacteria
develop resistance to the drugs.

 &HT;    Movie spies say `The Avengers' stinks
 &HT;    By Chris Garcia
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A tragically miscast Uma Thurman flounders. Sean Connery's
performance has made test audiences wince and cringe. Derisive
catcalls have been flung at the screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Avengers,'' it would seem, is in deep trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The first red flag spoke volumes: No press screenings for the
anticipated thriller, which is based on the '60s cult TV series of
the same name. When a studio, in this case Warner Bros., declines
to show their product to the press for opening day reviews, it
historically means they've got a stinker on their hands. (``We're
very proud of the movie,'' the studio has replied.)
</P>
<P>
   Then came the ouch-inducing clincher: Nine out of 10 writers on
Harry Knowles' bird-dogging Web site, aint-it-cool-news.com,
savaged ``The Avengers.'' For months, Knowles' emissaries have been
filing dismal reports based on the movie's few test screenings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Warners didn't do very many test screenings for this movie,''
says the Austin, Texas-based Knowles. ``They realized early on they
had a major bomb. They're trying to disguise a really bad movie. I
know people at the Phoenix, Ariz., test did not like the movie at
all. You could hear people laugh at the questions on the survey
cards afterwards. A couple of people said they felt embarrassed for
Sean Connery, that it was painful to watch him.''
</P>
<P>
   A reviewer who saw the film in England wrote on Knowles' Web
site, ``Uma just DIDN'T GET IT! ... Connery pretty much faxed in
his performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Knowles, who hasn't seen ``The Avengers'' yet, read the film's
script last summer. ``I could tell the Emma Peel character was
written wrong,'' he says. ``In the TV show, it was never about if
you could trust her, but here they try to create pseudo-tension
with a possible fake Emma Peel. It's so ill-conceived.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie reportedly cost $50 million to $60 million (not
including $30 million to $40 million to market it) and is bathed in
garish vestiges of '60s style. Knowles thinks the quirky aesthetic
might be losing some viewers. ``It's very visual. It's really
inspired by a lot of pop art. That stuff is going to be very iffy
for a lot of people.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we'll see,'' he says. ``I don't tend to trust opinions
about really quirky movies like this. It's like test screening a
Coen brothers movie in the Midwest, you know?''
</P>

 &HT;    GMC's Savana a full-sized alternative to minivans
 &HT;    By Linda Sharp
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When auto experts talk about ``alternative'' vehicles,
they are usually referring to those powered by natural gas or
electricity.
</P>
<P>
   But you might also consider a nontraditional vehicle as an
alternative. When most families consider the purchase of a van,
their only consideration may be a minivan. The perception is it is
driver- and parking-lot-friendly. Few buyers would ever consider a
full-size van, but they may be missing a great opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   GMC totally redesigned its full-size van for the '98 model year.
The Savana went back to being a full-frame vehicle, and from a
driving standpoint, it shows perhaps the greatest improvement of
any GM product this year.
</P>
<P>
   The previous full-size GM van could be quite a handful. It
tended to sail its way down the highway, often requiring intense
concentration on the part of the driver just to keep it in its
proper lane.
</P>
<P>
   Another shortcoming of this vehicle was the placement of the
engine and driver in relation to the front wheels. The driver sat
up over the front wheels, and legroom was cramped. The engine
compartment protruded into the passenger cabin.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, it was not a package that was very user-friendly for
anything other than commercial applications.
</P>
<P>
   Enter the new Savana.
</P>
<P>
   The driver now sits on a flat floor, and the engine has been
moved out of the interior compartment, providing a large, flat
pass-through to rear seats and storage areas. Seating can
accommodate everything from a full-size family to the soccer team.
When equipped with two rear seats (a third is optional), there is
still ample storage inside the van for six bicycles, a host of
camping gear or a vacation's worth of luggage.
</P>
<P>
   This space provides more than just convenience. It keeps your
belongings out of the weather and does so securely.
</P>
<P>
   Many times I see minivans traveling with either rooftop carriers
or overloaded bicycle racks. Rooftop carriers pose two problems:
They tend to make vehicles top-heavy because most folks put too
much in them, and they cause incredible drag, eating up fuel
mileage. It might be more cost-effective to ship your luggage ahead
than to pay the additional fuel costs. Bicycle racks run the risk
of people walking into them and being injured, or your bicycling
finding its way to a new home while you're in a rest stop or
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   The Savana eliminates all these problems, and does it in a
vehicle that drives as comfortably as any minivan while providing
the safety benefits of a full-frame vehicle. Fuel mileage is not
far from that of minivans, and the biggest surprise may be that a
dressed-out Savana can be less expensive than a comparably dressed
minivan.

 &HT;    The Spoken Word: Audiobook Reviews
 &HT;    By Joe Stafford

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ History tends to gloss over peaceful events,
focusing on the drama of conflict and the revelations of people at
their worst. No bit of recent history brings this home more
forcefully than ``The Rape of Nanking'' by Iris Chang (Blackstone
Audiobooks, 9 nine hours), in which the author argues that Japan's
refusal to accept its culpability as aggressor in World War II
makes this one of the war's great unclosed chapters.
</P>
<P>
   Unabridged in an irony-tinged reading by Anna Fields, the
audiobook transports the listener to a real-life hell where, for
about six weeks starting in December 1939, the Japanese army
murdered, raped, tortured and mutilated 300,000 civilians and
unarmed soldiers. This narrative of half-forgotten holocaust, which
Chang terms the worst single-event wartime atrocity in history, is
not for the weak of stomach, but one feels an obligation to the
victims to bear witness.
</P>
<P>
   Of Chinese descent, Chang does herself credit by refusing to
insinuate that the massacre or the war reveal a flaw in Japan's
national character. Instead, she passionately argues that Japan can
only hope to atone for wartime crimes by owning up to its
culpability and rebuking those extremists who seek to whitewash
events or paint wartime Japan as victim rather than aggressor.
</P>
<P>
   Chang's call is bolstered by more recent events: The release in
May of the Japanese movie ``Pride,'' in which Hideki Tojo, the
Japanese prime minister who gave the green light for the attack on
Pearl Harbor, is painted as a would-be savior. In the movie, which
met with approval or apathy in Japan, but with outrage in China and
North Korea, Tojo denies that the atrocity ever occurred _ a belief
now popular among Japanese right-wing nationalists.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most chilling moment in Chang's narrative is not a
scene of rape or torture, though there are many. The most
frightening moment occurs in modern times, as an anecdote from a
Japanese elementary school teacher. Because textbooks in Japan tend
to gloss over such events, his students are unaware their country
ever fought a war with the United States. And they want to know who
won.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line: This important book, though incomplete as a
history, should be read, in audio or hard copy, by anyone wishing
to claim a familiarity with the lingering consequences of World War
II. Recommended.
</P>
<P>
   Other recent histories on audio worthy of note:
</P>
<P>
   Of particular interest to us here in what was once 'Lyndon's
Town,' ``Taking Charge'' by Michael R. Beschloss (Simon &AMP; Schuster,
abridged, six hours) uses recordings of private conversations from
1962-'64 to create an interesting, mostly unbiased portrait of
Lyndon Johnson while exploiting one of audio's strengths: We hear
Johnson as he cajoles, rambles, jokes and charms, unveiling
dimensions that can be appreciated only when heard first-hand.
Though the tapings are often of poor quality and reveal nothing
genuinely new or startling, they do show the complexity of this
controversial and fascinating man.
</P>
<P>
   Those who want more where ``Saving Private Ryan'' came from
should listen to ``Citizen Soldiers,'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster Audio,
abridged, 5 five hours, narrated by Cotter Smith) the latest book
on audio from historian Stephen E. Ambrose. The book follows the
U.S. Army from D-Day through V-E Day, drawing a detailed portrait
of those who met the war at grunt level. Like Ambrose's other
recent histories on audio (''D-Day'' and ``Undaunted Courage''
among them), ``Citizen Soldiers'' is full of fascinating details,
from the agonies of trench foot to instructions on how to capture
an occupied house. One word of warning: Ambrose's reading voice is
grating and distracting. Look for titles, like this one, narrated
by a professional reader.
</P>
<P>
   ``A History of the English People'' by Paul Johnson (Blackstone
Audiobooks, 21 hours, unabridged, read by Nadia May) is a
provocative and insightful look at 2,000 years of English history.
Anglophiles will savor this study of how an island backwater
developed into one of the world's great empires. Its length and
depth makes this a worthy study for those wanting real scholarship
from their audio listening time. Available as a rental from
Blackstone, which specializes in great books.

 &HT;    BMW roadster, M3 models bring prestigious series to a milestone
 &HT;    By Russ DeVault
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The German/American automaker BMW reaches a milestone
this month when the 100,000th of its ``brand within a brand''
M-Series vehicles comes off the assembly line at its Greer, S.C.,
plant. The car, a two-seat roadster, will be pulled aside, given
some commemorative trim and shipped to Jacksonville to be raffled
off this fall by the BMW Car Club.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing amazing about the number of M-Series cars built
in South Carolina and Germany. The high-performance cars given the
performance perks by BMW's racing-oriented Motorsports division are
coveted by car buffs with deep pockets and by those who only dream
of owning one. What is astonishing is that BMW is allowing the
landmark M car to be built outside the fatherland.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were lucky to win the lottery of production,'' said Scott
Doniger, the New Jersey-based M brand manager. ``It happens to be
one of the roadsters (based on the Z3) targeted for the United
States market. It will be given some special trim and make some
appearances, including at the Petit LeMans race at Road Atlanta on
Oct. 10, before being raffled off in October by the 45,000-member
BMW Car Club.''
</P>
<P>
   No big deal is scheduled at the plant, although recognition will
be given the employees who complete the roadster, which would carry
a sticker of $43,340 if it joined its siblings in showrooms.
Instead, it will go into a special niche in the history of the M
cars, which debuted in 1978 when the mid-engined M1 sports car, a
277-horsepower rocket priced at about $60,000, was spun off from
the M1 race car.
</P>
<P>
   That 160-mph M1 has been followed by various M6, M5 and M3
machines, with some of the M6s from the 1980s now considered
collector cars. The offerings this model year include the Z3-based
M roadster, the M3 sedan ($40,840), the M3 coupe ($40,840) and the
M3 convertible ($47,040). All are powered by an ultra-responsive
3.2-liter six-cylinder engine, which makes 240 hp at 6,000 rpm and
has a broad torque range that peaks at 236 feet-pounds at 3,800
rpm.
</P>
<P>
   All also are image cars, both for BMW and their owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``BMWs are performance cars, and the M cars are the epitome of
our performance,'' brand manager Doniger says. ``People who buy
them include racing enthusiasts and people who take driving
programs. They're 70-75 percent male, very well educated and
modest, but with pretty high incomes. These are active people who
are very involved with cars. They don't sit around watching
television.''
</P>
<P>
   These are cars that beg to be driven, causing drivers to look
for errands to run and the long way home. The roadster, a logical
extension of the Z3, and the M3 cars, despite some having four
doors, clearly qualify as sports cars.
</P>
<P>
   Neither is overly large, nor will they take on much cargo. The
interiors and layouts are functional, but not particularly
luxurious or striking. Power tops and leather seating are standard
on both, and Harmon Kardon stereos with enough power to negate the
noise inherent with top-down driving are available.
</P>
<P>
   Safety considerations include the usual front air bags, with the
M3 cars adding side bags (optional on the roadster). The drop-tops
have roll-over protection systems, and all have seat belts that
give occupants a real belted-in feeling. Crisp steering, near 50-50
front-rear weight distribution, strong disc brakes and beefed-up
suspensions make both the roadster and the M3s remarkably
maneuverable.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the roadster's size _ or lack of it _ means it's not a
car that inspires comfort and security going wheel-to-wheel with
large cars and trucks on expressways and interstates. The
3,100-pound roadster is 158.5 inches long and 68.5 inches wide,
making it about an inch wider than the M3s, which are 174.5 inches
nose to tail.
</P>
<P>
   Get them out of the mainstream, however, and the roadster and
all three M3 machines really come into their own. BMW credits both
with 0-to-60 mph times of five-plus seconds, so acceleration is not
a problem. Clutches and shifters have solid, no-nonsense feels, and
a five-speed automatic transmission ($1,200) is available on the M3
sedan and convertible for those who don't care for the five-speed
manual that's standard on both cars.
</P>
<P>
   With its top up, the roadster has almost as much headroom (37.6
inches) as the M3s, and both have 41-plus inches of legroom. Both
have the usual wretched visibility of most convertibles and the
plastic covering of the instrumentation can generate glare that
makes it difficult to read the gauges and speedometers. The
leather-and-plastic interiors hold heat, and neither the roadster
nor the M3 air conditioner had enough strength to cope immediately
with this summer's 90-degree weather.
</P>
<P>
   Major controls are easily reached and operated. The
stalk-mounted levers are conveniently placed for finger-flicking
operation even by drivers who routinely keep both hands on the
steering wheel, which both cars encourage because of the erect
posture mandated by the seating and their fun-to-drive natures.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of a drive in the roadster or the 3-Series variants,
fun is what will stand out. BMW can talk about image, and some
owners may be lured by the status that comes with
limited-production cars, but the M roadster and the M3 convertible,
coupe and sedan are best appreciated by drivers who relish feeling
connected to the machine and the road under them.

 &HT;    Octane choice a vital decision for all
 &HT;    By Nora Carter
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Adhering to the manufacturer's specification for fuel
octane is not a condition limited to the owners of ``high
performance'' vehicles. It is just as important for the rest of us
to heed the octane requirements of the cars we drive.
</P>
<P>
   So what do we do when our owners manuals have long ago
disappeared? How do we determine which gas to stick in our tank at
the pump?
</P>
<P>
   Finding the best gas for the vehicle you drive is often a
condition of trial and error and compromise. This could involve
trying different brands of gasoline or different octanes of those
brands. The objective is to get the best performance and mileage
from your vehicle without wasting money on octane you don't need or
use, keeping in mind that ``marbles rattling in the can'' sound
(engine ping) is what you don't want.
</P>
<P>
   Outside of the manufacturer's specifications, other conditions
affect fuel the octane requirement for your vehicle:
</P>
<P>
   _ Driving habits, both how you drive and where you drive.
</P>
<P>
   Driver type 1: You spend most of your time in stop-and-go
traffic and taking short trips. Your accelerator pedal is rarely
depressed past mid- to three-quarter throttle and sees the floor
only in an emergency, the expressway on-ramp or when you're really
mad. Expressway trips are mostly mid-throttle.
</P>
<P>
   These driving conditions call for regular, 87 octane fuel with
an occasional (maybe once every fourth fill) tank of 89 octane
mid-grade. The only reason I mention the mid-grade is because it
usually contains more detergent additive than regular fuel and will
help minimize engine deposits. A gasoline with a higher RON number
(the R in R+M/2 on the pump) would be ideal.
</P>
<P>
   Driver type 2: Same driving conditions as above, except you're
more aggressive with the throttle, tempering the rapid acceleration
with the brake pedal. You prefer the left lane of the expressway.
I'd shop around the 89 octane market for starters. (The higher the
M number in R+M/2 on the pump.) If it pings, you need to pay the
big bucks for premium.
</P>
<P>
   _ Vehicle condition, age and maintenance (or lack of).
</P>
<P>
   Older, basic transportation vehicles that receive minimal
maintenance may actually require a higher octane fuel. Neglected
cooling systems, carbon buildup in the combustion chamber, and
marginal or nonfunctioning emission control systems can cause an
engine to run hotter. Although premium fuel helps eliminate the
pinging caused by any of these conditions, it is merely covering
the source of the problems.
</P>
<P>
   Older vehicles that are well maintained may also ping on lower
octane fuel. Carbon deposits accumulate in the combustion chamber
over a period of time and miles. Emission control systems, which
quite frankly have no maintenance intervals, quit working
correctly. Both of these conditions are repairable without taking
out a bank loan. The reimbursements are the ability to use lower
octane fuel once again.
</P>
<P>
   Always buy high-quality fuel from a major distributor. Cheap gas
leads to problems too numerous to list.

A HOLLYWOOD OUTSIDER DABBLES IN THE EMMY SPHERE

<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ The Emmy Award nominees this year are
the usual batch of glittering names. David Duchovny. Helen Hunt.
Jack Lemmon. Tom Hanks. Thomas Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   You heard right, Thomas Lewis. The racing crowd aside in this
historic town, Saratoga Springs and the campus of Skidmore College
is about as far removed as you are going to get from Hollywood, but
this professor is becoming a regular in Emmy circles.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, 56, a member of the Skidmore faculty, is an Emmy nominee
in the Historical Programming category for his program ``Divided
Highways: The Interstates and the Transformation of American
Life.'' The PBS documentary, based on a Lewis book, has already won
the prestigious Peabody Award for Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   For a show about pavement.
</P>
<P>
   The key to Lewis' success is finding the significant in the
everyday. His 1992 Emmy-nominated PBS effort, ``Empire of the Air:
The Men Who Made Radio,'' also based on one of his books, looked at
the origins of what today is a common household appliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you find in these films is a definition of who we are as
an American people, what makes us different,'' Lewis said. ``All of
these projects that I work on have to deal with the face of
America.''
</P>
<P>
   His latest effort deals with what is underfoot, our nation's
highways. We navigate our roads, occasionally cursing their
potholes and traffic, but generally don't stop to contemplate their
significance. How can you make highways interesting?
</P>
<P>
   ``Divided Highways'' ``turns the seemingly mundane development
of interstate highways into a transcendent statement about the role
of the car and the highway in our national consciousness,'' the
Peabody judges determined.
</P>
<P>
   The idea took form a few years back, as Lewis was traveling the
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started to get the idea after getting a traffic ticket in
Montana, which is a hard thing to do,'' he explained. ``I began
slowing down and thinking about the highways and how they
transformed America.

   ``The interstates have created this enormous economic engine
which changed the world,'' Lewis said. ``What I didn't realize
right away was the phenomenal social impact.''

   The Emmys for daytime, news/documentary and sports programs will
be presented Wednesday, Sept. 9, in New York City. The Primetime

<P>
   Lewis is already working on his next project, a four-part
history of Washington. He plans to look not just at the tourism of
the city, but the environs of a municipality created to serve as a
cradle of government.
</P>
<P>
   So why hasn't Lewis traded in his snow shovel for the sun of
Southern California?

   ``My first love is teaching,'' the English professor said. ``I

it here.''

RUBEN'S FILM IS FAR FROM PARADISE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By AMY BIANCOLLI  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's also a Serious Movie because Anne Heche, playing a Serious
Lawyer, is in need of a Serious Comb. Her level of disheveledness
rises as the plot evolves, as though a heavily moussed blond shag
were all that separated us from Third World countries.
</P>
<P>
   The movie was directed by Joseph Ruben (``Sleeping with the
Enemy,'' ``The Good Son''), who has a way with darkly crafted
moments. The dialogue by screenwriters Wesley Strick (``The
Saint'') and Bruce Robinson (``Fat Man and Little Boy'') is
literate in fits and starts, offering oblique commentary on an
extraordinary human struggle. And Joaquin Phoenix delivers a
crushing turn as the balmy inmate; his performance, full of agony
and grit, is the best reason to sit through this misdirected,
spasmodically compelling study of morality and errant justice.
</P>
<P>
   It's a shame, because ``Return to Paradise'' could have been
better. It should have been better. And it might have been were it
a mite less self-important, were it peopled with consistent
characters, and were the drama not disrupted by an absolutely
asinine romance. The film is based on a terrific premise: That
Phoenix's character (Lewis) will hang in eight days unless two
friends agree to serve time in the same prison. All three had spent
five hash-smoking, rum-swilling weeks in Malaysia, but only Lewis
got busted. He never told his buddies; he didn't want to drag them
into it.
</P>
<P>
   But now, after two solid years of squatting on a dirt floor, he
faces execution. Enter the buddies: Tony (David Conrad, of ABC's
erstwhile ``Relativity''), a sincere young construction worker, and
Sheriff (Vince Vaughn, ``Swingers'' and ``The Lost World: Jurassic
Park''), a natty limo driver whose disposition veers from sardonic
to cynical. He's not the kind of guy who'd volunteer for residency
in a Penang prison.
</P>
<P>
   Tony and Sheriff hear the bad news from Beth (Heche), Lewis'
American lawyer, who gives it to them straight: If both friends
agree to serve three years, Lewis will live. If one friend agrees
to serve six years, Lewis will live. If neither agrees, he'll die.
</P>
<P>
   It's a smart set-up, for it places a suffocating moral burden on
Tony and Sheriff. Tony has a fiancee would she wait three years for
him? Six years? How could he live with himself if Lewis died?
Sheriff is resolutely self-centered about the whole business,
shrugging off Beth's appeals with cold dismissals.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're appealing to a morality I don't have,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The hemming and hawing goes on and on, but none of it develops
into honest conflict; characters perform ethical backflips and
abrupt 180-degree turns for no particularly forceful reason. First
no one's going. Then both are going. Then only one is going. Then
Sheriff starts sleeping with Beth, but Tony doesn't know about it,
and Beth has a secret, and there's this obnoxious reporter who
ruins everything (Jada Pinkett Smith), and everyone gets mad at
each other, and no one makes any sense at all.
</P>
<P>
   The cast is hardly to blame Heche labors admirably in a vague
role, and Conrad wins a big gold star for restraint. Vaughn's
snippy charm carries him through the first half of the film, but
the sticky romantic subplot transforms him into a lop-eared rabbit.
</P>
<P>
   Moral waffling is a fine subject for a film (see ``The Horse
Whisperer''), but moral waffling based on blindly erratic behavior
is a dribbling waste of celluloid.
</P>
<P>
   The only rational character in the entire film is, ultimately,
Phoenix's. He has three remarkable scenes: One a taped appeal to
his friends, one during a prison visit, and one at the film's
climax. The visit sequence is a bit of hard poetry, a raw soliloquy
on emptiness and prayer delivered with trembling urgency.
</P>
<P>
   If you see ``Return to Paradise,'' see it for that. See it for
Phoenix, one of the most viscerally gifted young actors in film.
But shut your eyes to the rest of the movie, a rambling spin on
``Midnight Express'' with a permanently furrowed brow.

 &HT;    PROBES AND LAWSUITS AGAINST CLINTON MAY HAVE PERMANENTLY ALTERED
THE PRESIDENCY
 &HT;    Advance for release Monday, August 17.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Kenneth Starr's investigation of President
Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky and Paula Corbin Jones'
sexual harassment lawsuit against the chief executive have
established legal precedents that may have permanently altered the
office of the presidency, diminishing what was once widely regarded
as ''imperial.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We have moved from the imperial presidency to the imperiled
presidency,'' said Darrell West, a presidential scholar at Brown
University.
</P>
<P>
   While much of Washington has been waiting breathlessly for weeks
for Clinton's testimony Monday in the Starr investigation,
historians and scholars have spent months trying to determine the
long-term consequences to the White House of the Starr probe and
the Jones lawsuit, despite its dismissal earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Many wonder whether the presidents who follow Clinton into the
White House will be more vulnerable to legal assaults by political
enemies and unrestrained prosecutors, their power and prestige
thereby diminished, their political agendas curtailed or even
derailed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Defending against lawsuits may become a permanent state of
affairs for presidents,'' said Lane Crothers, a professor at
Illinois State University. ''And that means a lot of political
capital spent on things unrelated to a president's programs.''
</P>
<P>
   From the Supreme Court on down, judges involved in the Starr and
Jones cases have established a new set of precedents that have cost
Clinton dearly and, say the scholars, will make future presidents
easier targets for civil and criminal lawsuits, regardless of their
motive.
</P>
<P>
   ''The new legal restraints will check presidents of low
character, but will burden presidents of high character,'' said
John Pitney, a professor of government at Claremont McKenna College
in California. ''A future Lincoln or Eisenhower will have to live
by rules designed to rein in a Nixon or a Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Future presidents will come to office knowing that their most
senior legal advisers may be forced to testify against them, that
Secret Service agents charged with preserving their lives may not
protect their privacy, and that they themselves may be compelled to
testify, even in times of international crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr., who authored ''The Imperial
Presidency'' a quarter century ago, wrote in The New York Times
earlier this month that Starr's investigation of Clinton's sex life
had produced a ''harried and enfeebled'' presidency, also
succeeding in ''eliminating protections of presidential privacy
heretofore unchallenged.''
</P>
<P>
   But Donald Robinson, a White House expert at Smith College,
cautioned against ''buying into the Schlesinger line.'' ''Be
careful of writing an obituary for the imperial presidency,''
Robinson added. ''It is far from dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Schlesinger originally used the term ''imperial presidency'' to
call attention to the fact that the power of modern presidents
enabled them to commit troops abroad and to conduct foreign policy
without consulting, much less cooperating with Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ''And that still persists,'' said Robinson, noting that Clinton
extended the commitment of U.S. troops to Bosnia last spring _
after the Lewinsky scandal broke _ with hardly a whimper from
Congress. ''If anything, the president's troubles with Ken Starr
have increased his ability to make national security policy
secretly, on his own,'' Robinson added.
</P>
<P>
   To some degree, the damage done to the presidency is the work of
Clinton himself. ''Most presidents leave their mark on the
office,'' said Pitney. ''Bill Clinton will leave a stain.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Starr's lengthy investigation, initially of a shady
Arkansas land deal that happened 15 years ago, has led to court
rulings that there is no attorney-client privilege between a
president and White House lawyers in a criminal case and that
Secret Services agents may be compelled to tell a grand jury what
they have witnessed as a result of their required proximity to the
president.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're forcing presidents into a cocoon,'' said Joel Goldstein,
a constitutional scholar at Saint Louis University. ''Future
presidents may not be willing to discuss private matters with
anyone except their spouses.'' Husbands and wives cannot be
compelled to testify against their spouses.
</P>
<P>
   And last spring, amid heightened tensions with Saddam Hussein
over United Nations inspections of Iraqi weapon sites, Jones'
lawsuit produced a Supreme Court ruling that a civil suit against a
sitting president does not have to wait until the president has
left office.
</P>
<P>
   ''What this all means, of course, is that the country is forced
by the media and Kenneth Starr to focus attention on the politics
of scandal rather than the substantive domestic and foreign policy
issues that deserve the country's attention,'' said Craig
Rimmerman, a professor at Hobart and William Smith Colleges in New
York and author of numerous books on the presidency.

AT THE WOODSTOCK SITE, A `GARDEN' GROWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GREG HAYMES  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BETHEL, N.Y. _ For 17 years, Danny Socolof has been creating
special events, but nothing had really prepared him for his current
job _ executive producer of ``A Day in the Garden,'' the three-day
rock festival that's being held this weekend at Max Yasgur's farm
in Bethel, the site of the original Woodstock fest back in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   A graduate of the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of
Business, Socolof began his career as a concert promoter for Little
Feat, Count Basie, Genesis, Jethro Tull and other acts.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, he founded the Marketing Entertainment Group of America
(MEGA), which produced events for such clients as MTV, Pepsi Cola
and Nintendo. The company celebrated its 10th anniversary by
creating the six-acre Surreal Field at the Woodstock '94 festival
in Saugerties.
</P>
<P>
   But now Socolof, 42, is focusing all of his attention on ``A Day
in Garden,'' but the main behind-the-scenes man took a few minutes
out to chat about this weekend's big shows:
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's been going on at the festival site?
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, we are underneath some extraordinary pressures here.
Basically, we're building a venue. We are bringing an extraordinary
venue to life after 29 years of it being a mostly dormant pasture,
and it's an enormous amount of work.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What do you mean by ``building a venue''?
</P>
<P>
   A: What I mean is that we are hosting three days of shows here
with the same stage that Garth Brooks used in Central Park last
year. We're erecting over a quarter million square feet of tenting
for the food and craft vendors. And then there's the infrastructure
_ roadways, backstage facilities for artists, parking lots for the
convenience of our patrons.
</P>
<P>
   So we're not actually ``building a venue'' in the conventional
sense. In fact, we're building a venue in quite the unconventional
sense. We're taking a farm that hasn't been used in almost 30 years
and making it a viable, workable, safe and beautiful environment.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How are ticket sales going? Are they selling as well as
expected?
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, I don't know what anybody expected. No one's done
anything here in 29 years, so I think it's safe to say that this is
a learning experience for everybody that's involved. But let me say
that we are doing very well ...
</P>
<P>
   The point of this whole thing was to balance art and commerce.
And I think that if we had to lean one way, we definitely have
chosen to lean toward art.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you envision building a permanent stage on the site in the
future?
</P>
<P>
   A: The idea here is to rededicate the site, and get it into
shape so that it can have a long and healthy future to host a
variety of music, including classical, jazz, blues, country and, of
course, rock 'n' roll, too.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's the mood of the people working on the site?
</P>
<P>
   A: Everybody's got a really good spirit about it. It's very
exciting to be doing this because there's a certain buzz, a certain
magic, on this site. All you have to do to feel it, is to walk onto
the land. It's a very magical place, and everybody working here
feels it. We hope that _ with some good weather _ we're going to
have a really extraordinary weekend of performances.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The event will go on rain or shine, right?
</P>
<P>
   A: Of course, this is a world-class stage with a covered roof
for the artists. And we'll have over a quarter of a million square
feet of tenting that was never here before.
</P>
<P>
   The show will go on rain or shine, but we're crossing our
fingers that it goes on under beautiful blue skies and white
clouds.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How big a security force will you have? A: I can't divulge
details of that because it wouldn't be a secure plan if I divulged
it.
</P>
<P>
   We're hoping that people are really cool this year, and don't
try to sneak in. This is a tremendous, tremendous site, and when
you have people like Pete Townshend and Joni Mitchell and Don
Henley and everybody else that's coming, you have an opportunity in
this region to host extraordinary artists.
</P>
<P>
   And part of that depends on having a covenant with the audience,
where the audience respects the site and respects what we're trying
to do. And so the first part of our message is for everybody to be
cool.
</P>
<P>
   Secondly, the tickets are priced right.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How has new technology and the Internet affected the event?
</P>
<P>
   A: We're Web-casting all of ``A Day in the Garden.'' The entire
event _ all three days of performance in real time _ is being
broadcast over the Internet via Infoseek (http://www.infoseek.com).
</P>
<P>
   Q: Obviously, you were at the Woodstock '94 festival, but did
you go to Woodstock in 1969?
</P>
<P>
   A: For Woodstock '94, my company produced the Surreal Field, so,
oh yeah, I was there.
</P>
<P>
   At Woodstock '69, I was 13 years old, and I tried to go, but I
had a six-foot-four dad who blocked every route out of the house,
so I didn't make it to that one.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What do you plan to do on Monday morning when you wake up and
it's all over?
</P>
<P>
   A: If I wake up, you mean? If I wake up Monday morning, I'm
going to try to go back to sleep. (Laughter.) Actually, I love my
work. I love what I'm doing, and I'm a dedicated pro, so I'll
probably wake up Monday morning and help clean up and break down
the equipment.
</P>
<P>
   But then I am headed off to a very remote, faraway place with no
phones, no faxes and no beepers.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Any closing thoughts?
</P>
<P>
   A: We have a message that we're sending to everybody, and it's
very simple _ welcome back.

A DRIVER IS SOFTWARE THAT CONNECTS PROGRAMS TO COMPUTER HARDWARE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: It's definition time for this computer ``dummy.'' I have seen
you mention ``drivers'' in various columns and stories, but I
really don't understand what a driver is. It didn't matter until
last week, when I got my first computer (yes, I was reading your
column before I had one!) and suddenly I realize I need to keep my
drivers updated, as you and others say. But, um, what are they?
</P>
<P>
   A: You can think of a driver as a kind of translator.
</P>
<P>
   In an operating system such as Windows 95/98/NT, in which a
friendly face is presented to shield the user from the complexity
of the operating system's ``guts,'' software is not allowed to talk
directly to the various hardware components.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a game running in Windows 95 doesn't send its audio
directly to the sound card. Instead, it must go through a layer of
software that, in turn, talks to the hardware. These are known as
drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers keep order, both in the operation of your PC and in the
world of software development. First, they help to prevent
conflicts when two programs try to access the same piece of
hardware _ though particularly in Windows 95/98, they aren't always
successful. Those who remember hassling with sound settings in DOS
games know what I'm talking about.
</P>
<P>
   They also provide a uniform way for the creators of software
programs to communicate with various hardware devices. This way,
each program doesn't need its own set of translators to talk to the
hardware. Developers can rely on the fact that the hardware drivers
they need to use will be in place, and program accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   In the bad old days of DOS, developers had to write drivers for
each program they created. For example, the popular WordPerfect 5.1
_ the last great DOS word processor _ came with several disks of
printer drivers. Now, WordPerfect 8 for Windows 95/98/NT can rely
on the printer driver installed in the operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I want to be able to have my screen saver launch at my
control in Windows 98. It used to do this, when I had Windows 95. I
could put my mouse cursor in a corner and it would start the screen
saver. Since installing Windows 98, this feature doesn't work
anymore. What can I do?
</P>
<P>
   A: The ability to have so-called ``hot corners'' for your screen
saver is a function of the Windows 95 Plus! pack, an add-on for
Windows 95. The hot corners actually are controlled by a component
called the System Agent, which is used to auto-start programs at
specific times. You can tell when the System Agent is running
because you have an icon in the taskbar tray that looks like a
window with a clock and calendar in front of it.
</P>
<P>
   With Windows 98, Microsoft has changed the System Agent into the
Task Scheduler, and several features were apparently left out,
including hot corners. They are not present in the Windows 98 Plus!
pack, either.
</P>
<P>
   However, there is an alternative. Screen savers in Windows are
files with a .SCR extension, and they are stored in the Windows
folder. Find the saver you want to use and drag it from the Windows
folder onto your desktop, or create a shortcut to the file on your
desktop. Then, when you want to launch the saver, just click on the
file.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you settle a bet? A friend of mine says the original
floppy disks were 5 1/4 inches. But my dad said he remembers floppy
disks that were bigger than that.
</P>
<P>
   A: Score one for Dad. The first floppy disks were 8 inches
across and held less than 200 kilobytes of data: They barely fit in
a briefcase, much less a shirt pocket.

MOM AND DAD'S ADVENTURE IN COMPUTING ENDS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   About a month ago, I decided to put a made-for-novices personal
computer to the ultimate test: my parents. Although they're not
completely computer illiterate _ having suffered through a pokey,
hand-me-down, 486 system _ they're close to it.
</P>
<P>
   They don't have to ask how to turn the thing on, but they're
hard-pressed to find the America Online download folder in Windows
95.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent column, I chronicled their experience unpacking and
setting up a new Compaq Presario 2254, a low-end system that sells
for $899, and a 14-inch MV400 multimedia monitor with a $179 price
tag (www.chron.com/content/chronicle/tech/98/07/10/compute.html).
That process went smoothly enough, with only a couple of glitches.
However, those problems would have required separate calls to
technical support, had I not been present.
</P>
<P>
   After it was obvious the computer was functioning as it should,
I drove off into the sunset, leaving them to explore. I checked
back with them on a weekly basis to see how it was going.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `WE NEED TWO COMPUTERS'
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Overall, they loved this computer. Despite the fact that it's a
low-priced machine, it's hardly low-performing. With its
266-megahertz Advanced Micro Devices K6 chip, 32 megabytes of
memory, four-gigabyte hard drive, 32X CD-ROM drive and 56K modem,
it galloped with the applications they use regularly.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it was the speed that they appreciated the most.
They've been living with a 486 system that runs at 66 megahertz and
has only 20 megabytes of memory. This is a seriously slow machine.
Sometimes you can literally boil a cup of water in a microwave in
the time it takes the opening page at Yahoo! _ my father's favorite
stop on the Infobahn _ to finish loading on AOL.
</P>
<P>
   After using the Presario 2254 for a few days, he sent me this
message: ``This is the way it's supposed to be.''
</P>
<P>
   I keep him on the ``buddy list'' of AOL Instant Messenger _ a
chat program that alerts you when friends sign on to AOL or fire up
their own copy of the Messenger program _ and I watched his time
spent online increase. Suddenly, using the Web went from being
painful to pleasant, and Dad developed a serious Internet jones.
</P>
<P>
   My mother uses the computer to do artwork and play card games,
which she loves. My father's time online apparently caused some
tension in the household.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need two computers,'' my mother said through clenched
teeth.
</P>
<P>
   The speed also helped with a low-budget scanner my parents had
bought to digitize old family photos and send recent pictures to
friends and relatives via e-mail. Using the scanner on the 486 was
an exercise in agony, but became nearly effortless on the Presario.
</P>
<P>
   My mother complained that the cards jumped off the screen so
fast when she won at Solitaire that she couldn't savor her victory.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   GOOD POINTS, BAD POINTS
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In general, they both found the computer easy to use. They
mentioned Compaq's extensive online help files as being a big plus
_ they were understandable and actually helpful.
</P>
<P>
   Although they didn't venture too far from their regular PC
usage, they did experiment a bit with new things. For example, my
father became a fan of MotoRacer, a motorcycle game that's bundled
with the 2254. He's not been interested in racing games before _
and couldn't play this one on his older machine, anyway _ but now
he's talking about getting a joystick.
</P>
<P>
   However, it wasn't all digital peaches and cream. There were
some things about this computer they didn't particularly like.
</P>
<P>
   One of them was the keyboard. They both found it stiff and
unresponsive. My father even went so far as to grab a micrometer
from his workbench and measure the size and depth of the keys and
compare them to the old keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   (This highlights a crucial factor to consider when trying out a
computer. If you are buying a system in a store, spend time typing
on the keyboard. The keyboard is one of the primary ways humans
interact with computers, so you should find one that's
comfortable.)
</P>
<P>
   The Presario keyboard also includes a set of four buttons that,
when pushed, launch a browser showing pre-chosen Web sites. My
parents played with this feature and found it interesting, but they
resented the fact that the main Internet button directed you to a
Compaq-branded GTE Internet service.
</P>
<P>
   ``We already use AOL. Why can't it just set up so it uses what
we already have?'' my father asked.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, they tried signing up for the 50 free hours of
Internet access. Both were put off by the amount of personal
information the sign-up process required, and when they tried to
connect to the server to send in their application, the screen just
sat there. They eventually gave up.
</P>
<P>
   After a month, their grand experiment was over. This was only a
loaner, and I arrived to box up the Presario and take it. They both
looked on wistfully as I loaded it back in my car.
</P>
<P>
   They're back to living with the older machine. Maybe they'll buy
a new system now that they've had a taste of modern computing
power. Or, maybe they'll do what many other users of older PCs do,
and keep using it as long as it meets their needs.

FEDERAL INVOLVEMENT NEEDED TO CLEAN UP RACIALLY-TINGED MESS

   Commentary

<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The bizarre story of Jermaine Henderson, Sean
McKenna and William Bonanni has taken an intriguing twist. In one
of the most controversial criminal cases in the memory of this
town, the prosecutors either:
</P>
<P>
   A. Screwed up by the numbers, or
</P>
<P>
   B. Were victimized by bad decisions by a judge, or
</P>
<P>
   C. Took a dive that Greg Louganis would envy.
</P>
<P>
   At best, both the Albany County district attorney's office and
Special Prosecutor John Dorfman come off like abject mental
deficients. The mayor is beside himself. A good portion of this
city's black community seems furious. And everybody involved in
this debacle is pointing fingers at everybody else.
</P>
<P>
   A little background here:
</P>
<P>
   Jermaine Henderson, who is black, is the former College of St.
Rose basketball star who either did or did not sucker punch an
off-duty cop in a bar last October. Sean McKenna and William
Bonanni are the two off-duty white cops who busted Henderson,
handcuffed him and then either did or did not beat the spit out of
him some time later in a police garage.
</P>
<P>
   As things stand now, we'll probably never know for sure who did
what to whom. That's because Albany County Court Judge Larry Rosen
threw out criminal charges against the cops on Wednesday, just as
he'd thrown out the charges against Henderson the previous week. He
ruled that the prosecutors had badly bobbled both cases.
</P>
<P>
   So none of these guys seems likely to end up on a witness stand,
sworn to tell the truth under penalty of perjury _ assuming, that
is, that perjury is still a crime in this country. That seems an
open question these days. Sure, there'll be a civil lawsuit, but
those things generally get settled without courtroom testimony.
It's also possible that the feds will go after the cops for
supposedly violating Henderson's civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible, too, that an appeal by the prosecutors will
overturn Rosen's decision and a jury might actually get to hear
this case.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, though, it seems that a good many black folks in this
town strongly suspect that the D.A.'s office, which works with the
cops all the time, just tanked on this baby rather than prosecute
police officers.
</P>
<P>
   As Albany County Legislator Lucy McKnight said: ``I hope the
federal government steps in ... That's what the public needs to
have. We need to have a trial and to have all this aired.''
</P>
<P>
   What happened was this:
</P>
<P>
   In separate grand juries, one hearing the sucker punch
accusation against Henderson and the other hearing the street
justice charge against the cops, both the D.A.'s office
investigating Henderson and the special prosecutor investigating
the cops let all three guys testify without first getting them to
sign waivers of immunity from prosecution for what they told the
grand juries.
</P>
<P>
   Like, duh.
</P>
<P>
   Without a waiver, Rosen ruled last week, Henderson couldn't be
prosecuted for whatever he fessed up to. And, Rosen ruled
Wednesday, when the Albany County D.A.'s office asked the cops what
had happened in the bar without a waiver, they were essentially
asking about the cops' alleged motive to allegedly whomp Henderson
upside the head in the garage later _ allegedly.
</P>
<P>
   Dorfman, livid, is appealing the cops' decision. District
Attorney Sol Greenberg needs to appeal the decision on Henderson.
Both prosecutors should be begging frantically for the feds to step
in immediately. To do anything else would only fan the flames of
suspicion felt by Lucy McKnight and the minority folks she
represents about this incredible turn of events in this ugly,
sloppy case.
</P>
<P>
   Just the truth. That's all Lucy McKnight wants.
</P>
<P>
   And to get this horrible stink out of the air.

LAW DEANS' TENURE GROWS PRECARIOUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADAM PERTMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWTON, Mass. _ When Boston College law students decide whose
courses to take this year, their choices will include three
professors who not only enjoy national reputations but whose last
jobs were as the deans of respected law schools.
</P>
<P>
   This trio of heavyweights shares another distinction, and it's
the reason they are now teaching at BC rather than leading at their
respective schools. They were all forced from their posts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call this my own special program for deposed deans,'' Aviam
Soifer, a Boston College Law School professor, said last week. He
arranged the visiting professorships for his two ousted colleagues
even as he joined their ranks, resigning last fall as dean under
pressure from his own institution's president.
</P>
<P>
   The academics' situations are hardly unique. In the last year,
at least seven law school deans nationwide have been ousted from
their jobs _ a much higher number in such a short period than
anyone in the legal community can remember.
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, exactly one-quarter of the nation's 180 law
schools reported dean vacancies this year, according to the
American Bar Association. Figures compiled by the ABA and the
Association of American Law Schools indicate that on average, deans
today remain in their position for less than four years _ down from
five to six years a decade ago, and from 10 to 15 years just a
generation ago.
</P>
<P>
   Whether this lessening of continuity hurts legal education in
the long run is unclear. But nearly all those involved agree the
trend, barely noticed outside the legal world, reveals fundamental
changes in how the leadership of law schools _ and, in some ways,
of universities in general _ has evolved to become more difficult
and stressful.
</P>
<P>
   ``A job that in the past had been one that was always
challenging and that most people could control ... has become much
more intense and rigorous,'' said David Hall, who resigned recently
as dean of Northeastern's law school to become the university's
provost. ``That has to make various individuals rethink what
they're going to do with their careers.''
</P>
<P>
   As universities operate more _ and more overtly _ like
bottom-line enterprises, the demands on deans have grown. They
include stunning amounts of time for fund-raising; increased
competition for high-caliber professors and students, leading some
deans to take extraordinary steps such as traveling the country to
personally recruit individual college seniors; and diminished power
for many deans, who are treated by their presidents as middle
managers rather than as autonomous leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The universities are hustling for money,'' said Fr. Robert
Drinan, who served as law school dean at Boston College for 14
years and now teaches at Georgetown University in Washington. ``So
things have become very competitive, and deans don't stay so
long.''
</P>
<P>
   The school-as-business phenomenon throws new balls into deans'
juggling acts while giving more weight to others.
</P>
<P>
   Those include trying to achieve a balance between theoretical or
academic teaching, which most professors consider vital, and
practical training _ showing students how to be attorneys _ which
law firms increasingly press law schools to do. And, even as they
strive to please their presidents and boards of trustees above, the
deans also try to maintain peace below in their faculties, which
have conflicting priorities and often include media stars, strong
personalities, serious scholars, and others with considerable egos.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of different constituencies and a lot more
ways in which those constituencies need to be paid attention to
than there were 10 or 15 years ago,'' said BC law professor Soifer.
He was among many current and former deans interviewed who
emphasized that despite the new challenges, they enjoyed the work.
</P>
<P>
   Deans' burdens also include longtime nuisances that are growing
in magnitude, such as wealthy people hinting at huge grants or even
bribes if their children gain acceptance to a particular school.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Barbara Aldave _ who will be teaching at
Northeastern in the fall and then Boston College in the spring,
after being pushed out as dean of St. Mary's University Law School
in San Antonio _ said she has been offered as much as $1 million,
for her own use, to ``expedite'' a student's acceptance. And Colin
Diver, who served briefly as law school dean at Boston University
and now holds that post at the University of Pennsylvania, said he
has rejected two separate $250,000 incentives.
</P>
<P>
   James Rogers, interim dean at BC Law, said that many professors
who take a dean's job become frustrated once they realize how
little time they have for academic work. ``In general, to be a
successful law school dean ... you need to be a distinguished
scholar,'' Rogers said. ``But the job allows you very little time
for those activities that led you to the job in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   Soliciting contributions, in particular, has become so integral
to most senior administrators' responsibilities that it increases
the stress and workload of jobs that are already difficult.
Moreover, fund-raising success has come to rival academic and
management skills as a key measure of performance.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure to raise money has grown even though law schools,
unlike most divisions of a university, take in enough tuition to
pay their own expenses. But cash-strapped presidents increasingly
are asking for a share of any extra tuition money or other
surpluses to fill other institutional needs.
</P>
<P>
   That was the case this year with the dean of Georgetown Law
Center, Judith Areen, who was so successful in obtaining
contributions that the school's president wanted to channel some to
his deficit-ridden medical school. When Areen refused, she was
booted, but a public-relations campaign by the popular dean's
supporters and financial backers led to a rapid reversal of that
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Shane, who will teach at Boston College this spring with
Aldave and Soifer, wasn't as lucky. Three weeks after being named
one of the nation's 40 ``Young Leaders'' by the American
Association of Higher Education in January, he was prodded to
resign as dean of the University of Pittsburgh School of Law
because of another fund-sharing dispute. He, like all of those
interviewed, declined to discuss specifics of his situation.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Clark, the dean at Harvard Law School for a decade, said
fund-raising now fills about one-third of his time. ``It just
didn't used to exist as part of the job,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clark added that a boom in law-school growth during the 1970s
and 1980s led to another little-understood addition to most deans'
duties: overseeing more clerical workers and other staff members
who deal with expanded student bodies and bureaucracies.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to be the CEO of a large administrative staff ...
while being an intellectual, a political leader and a
fund-raiser,'' said Clark.
</P>
<P>
   One factor cited by dean after dean as a reason their jobs have
gotten tougher is the law-school ranking published annually since
1990 by US News &AMP; World Report. They said the ratings have
heightened competition among all the institutions, escalating their
efforts to recruit students and prestigious professors, which adds
to their expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, 164 law school deans signed a letter to
93,000 applicants asking them to disregard the US News issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're engaged in an arms race for students and faculty, and in
order to pay for it, we have to raise ever larger amounts of
money,'' said Diver, who cited Harvard Law's recent success in
luring Lani Guinier from the University of Pennsylvania. ``And
those US News rankings just exacerbate the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   As for finding a successor for Soifer at BC, sources familiar
with the situation said the search process has taken longer than
expected because two candidates who had expressed strong interest
fell through.
</P>
<P>
   One reportedly was Russell Osgood, dean of the Cornell
University Law School, who was wooed away from BC Law to become
president of tiny Grinnell University in Iowa _ with a pay package
sweetened by billionaire Warren Buffett, a trustee of the school.
The other candidate, who was described only as ``a minority with
terrific credentials,'' was said to have been unable to arrange the
logistics of leaving his current post.

OFF-CENTER `GOVERNESS' OFFERS GUILTY PLEASURE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JEFF MILLAR 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is much to admire about ``The Governess,'' a
handsome-to-the-eye and thematically engrossing British film set in
the 1840s. A young Sephardic Jewish woman whose family suffers
reduced circumstances must take a position as governess on an
island off the coast of Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   Were you to triangulate writer-director Sandra Goldbacher, you
would find her blip moving among the coordinates of Bronte, Peter
Greenaway and Harlequin.
</P>
<P>
   It is pleasurable in there, sometimes guiltily pleasurable, and
sometimes the guilt is sorely pressured. The dialogue often dices
with howlers.
</P>
<P>
   Rosina Da Silva (Minnie Driver) lives within a loving family, as
intensely insular as the Sephardic Jewish community itself.
Antisemitism is intense, not that the Sephardic are that interested
in assimilation; the Da Silvas believe themselves superior in every
way to gentiles and want little of their company.
</P>
<P>
   But Rosina's beloved father is murdered. To support the family,
Rosina assumes the name of Mary Blackchurch and takes the position
as governess to the Cavendishes of the Isle of Skye.
</P>
<P>
   Her charge is the early-adolescent Clementina (Florence Hoath).
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Cavendish (Harriet Walker), who longs to live in London,
asks Rosina/Mary if ``it is possible to die of boredom and
disappointment.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Cavendish (Tom Wilkinson) is an archetypal 19th-century
English gentleman scientist who spends almost all his waking
moments collecting specimens or in his workroom with the camera
obscura. ``Arcane and futile,'' he calls his work.
</P>
<P>
   Goldbacher gives Mr. Cavendish the intellectual life of
gentleman scientist William Henry Fox Talbot, the inventor of the
calotype. Talbot was in a race with Louis Daguerre to discover how
to permanently fix a photographic image to a medium _ Daguerre as a
positive to a metal plate, Talbot as a negative to paper.
</P>
<P>
   Rosina is a passionate, artistic, curious and intelligent woman
gender-trapped in a time and place where there is little socially
acceptable outlet for any of those qualities. She would have been
an actress, had not the profession been so utterly disreputable.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Cavendish asks her to help catalog his collections, which
leads to her working with him on the calotype experimentation. This
leads to her prodding him into using photography for artistic
expression, not just for getting an image on paper to see if it can
be ``fixated,'' as Goldbacher puts it, borrowing the induction for
the word's auxiliary usage of ``to preoccupy obsessively.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You have made it possible to capture the essence of people,''
says Rosina passionately, ``to fix memory.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldbacher suggests that it is the confluence of Rosina's
intellectual excitement and sexual curiosity that results in her
falling in love with her employer, and to her taking bold measures
to prompt love's reciprocation.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a period piece; Goldbacher's perspective is entirely
contemporary, and we suspect there is to be gender perfidy ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Cavendish is unprepared to commit to Rosina to the extent
she has immersed herself in him. ``This is madness!'' he cries,
thinking of his family. And then, thinking more of himself, ``You
consume me! I do not want the feelings that I have! You take the
strength I need for my work!'' Goldbacher's dialogue tends to
sprout exclamation points.
</P>
<P>
   When Rosina suggests that when the work on the calotype is
published she share in the credit, Mr. Cavendish smiles besottedly.
But what will he say when the editor of the scientific journal
arrives for the demonstration?
</P>
<P>
   (Among other things that, in truth, the discovery of the
fixative agent _ saltwater _ was an accident. It was Rosina who had
the accident _ she spilled the saltwater on a negative _ but it was
just an accident. She didn't exactly sit down with a Periodic Table
and a quill and work out that sodium chloride should do the trick.
Goldbacher later has Mr. Cavendish metaphorically smite his
forehead and cry out that he should have realized that sodium
chloride would do the trick. Had one of the Cavendish hounds
knocked over the bowl of saltwater, would Mr. Cavendish have been
obliged to share the publication credit with the pooch?)
</P>
<P>
   The film is impeccably acted, in that impeccable British way.
Although it's entirely Driver's film, one becomes conscious of the
valiant Wilkinson, whom Goldbacher has given the highest-risk
dialogue (``I could drown in your hair. It's like . . .
treacle.''). Wilkinson played the homophobe in ``Wilde'' and the
reticent laid-off steel mill foreman in ``The Full Monty.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Governess,'' rated R, is consistently off-center, which is
enough to recommend it. But the screenplay feels a bit long in the
hothouse.

ANCIENT EGYPT MOVES INTO NEW QUARTERS AT THE MFA 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-ART-BOS

 By CHRISTINE TEMIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Egyptian and Ancient Near Eastern collections in
the Museum of Fine Arts used to be housed in quarters that
suggested ``The Mummy's Curse.'' They were either banished to
basement storage that was dark and dank or consigned to galleries
that weren't much better. Not very respectful treatment for a
collection that dates back to 1872, just two years after the
museum's founding, and ranks among the world's best.
</P>
<P>
   All that changes as of Saturday, Aug. 15, with the opening of
the museum's lavishly renovated galleries for this material. The
oldest objects in the MFA's collections now reside in the most
modern quarters in the whole museum complex.
</P>
<P>
   The galleries cost a bundle. The MFA acknowledges that, but
won't say exactly how much, only that a members' campaign raised
$1.2 million toward the overhaul. A particularly populist
fund-raiser _ more than 9,000 individual gifts, ranging from $5 to
$30,000 _ it reflects the popularity of these collections.
Everybody loves the mummies.
</P>
<P>
   The galleries were designed to prolong the life of objects
celebrating death _ objects from Egypt, a society obsessed with the
hereafter, and from the Ancient Near East, parts of which were
equally obsessed with mass murder. Or, as MFA curator Rita Freed
cheerfully puts it, ``Ancient Near Eastern art was about killing as
many people as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the 700 newly ensconced objects have never been on
public view before, and others have been hidden away for their own
protection. The MFA's mummies first enjoyed the luxury of climate
control during their appearance in the 1988 Gund Gallery show
``Mummies and Magic.'' They got spoiled. They couldn't stand the
strain of returning to MFA galleries where ``climate control''
meant electric fans and open windows, so they went to an area of
storage where (itals)real(unitals) climate control existed. Only
now are some of them surfacing again.
</P>
<P>
   One enormous 6th-century BC sarcophagus _ a black basalt monster
belonging to a general named Kheper-Re _ is not only surfacing, but
standing at attention. Meant to spend eternity in a prone position,
the sacophagus is now bolt upright. Authenticity has been
sacrificed for drama: The looming, dimly lit anthropomorphic
sculpture looks ready to cast a spell on you.
</P>
<P>
   At least the 2-ton sarcophagus won't fall on you _ not even in
an earthquake. Arthur Beale, the MFA's director of objects
conservation and scientific research, explains that extensive
earthquake precautions make the new galleries the place to be when
the Big One hits Boston. And it just might, warns Beale, adding
that there was a major quake here in the 18th century, and that the
museum's location on filled land makes it particularly vulnerable.
So, to rev up for the renovation, Beale headed to California to
study seismic retrofitting, and came back to oversee the building
of steel ``cocoons'' around each case in the new galleries.
</P>
<P>
   Another earthquake precaution: The stones in that ornately
carved 5-ton tomb wall are no longer resting on one another,
although they look as if they are. Each is now separately
suspended. In the event of an earthquake, they'll bounce, not
break.
</P>
<P>
   Fiber optic lighting, used more extensively here than anywhere
else in the museum, cuts the excess heat that can turn exhibit
cases into greenhouses, eliminates emissions that might endanger
fragile objects, and can be changed without opening exhibit cases
and disturbing their delicate environments. Silica gels in the
bases of the new cases control the humidity around artworks that
used to live in the desert.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the most advanced microclimates we've used in the
museum,'' says Beale. ``We've set a benchmark for all future
installations here.'' That benchmark has made walking out of the
new spaces and into the adjacent classical or Nubian galleries like
walking out of the First World and into the Third, where air
conditioning is but a dream, and August is sauna season.
</P>
<P>
   Beale's contributions to the new galleries are elaborate,
expensive, state-of-the-art _ and invisible. All that fiber optic
plastic and glass spaghetti, all those silica gels, are hidden
away, in the interest of creating an atmosphere akin to the tomb
scene in ``Aida'' for the Egyptian gallery, and a Cecil B. De
Mille-ish version of ancient Babylon in the one devoted to the
Ancient Near East.
</P>
<P>
   In these new spaces the MFA has signed on to the recent
museological trend toward galleries-as-stage-sets, especially in
the Ancient Near Eastern gallery, with its approximation of the
archways and ziggurat-shaped crenellations from the Great Ishtar
Gate in Babylon. The designers _ the architectural firm
Jung/Brannen Associates Inc., who worked with the MFA's in-house
team _ must have had fun coming up with details to help define the
Ancient Near East for Americans who are vague even on where it was.
Hence their cleverest stroke _ a map of the area made of colored
stones, embedded in the floor as if it were an ancient mosaic. A
single map can't show 6,000 years' worth of shifting borders, of
course, so this map doesn't have any _ just strategically placed
names of cities, countries, and bodies of water. Some, like
``Babylon'' and ``Ninevah,'' have a magical ring; occasionally,
there's a modern intrusion, as with ``Iran.'' The floor map also
saves valuable wall space, and is child-friendly: Freed expects to
see school groups sitting on the carpet beside it.
</P>
<P>
   Another curator might have installed an image with a come-hither
look at the entrance of a new gallery, to lure visitors in. Not
Freed. ``This is our banner,'' she says proudly, pointing to a
9th-century BC Assyrian stone relief of a demigod she pronounces
``a brute.'' This thug's role was to protect King Assurnasirpal II
from harm, by scaring off evil spirits. While he looks as if he's
been spending his days at Gold's Gym, the shallow carving that
defines his bulky contours is crisp, even dainty. Reliefs of
demigods once lined the halls of Assyrian palaces; in the 19th
century, though, Christian missionaries brought them back by the
cartload to Europe and America, not just for their aesthetic merit,
but for their Biblical associations as well.

`PARADISE' LOST DESPITE FINE CAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
RETURN TO PARADISE 
Directed by: Joseph Ruben 
Screenplay by: Wesley Strick, Bruce Robinson 
Starring: Vince Vaughn, Anne Heche, Joaquin Phoenix, David Conrad,
Vera Farmiga, Nick Sandow, Jada Pinkett Smith 
Running time: 109 minutes 
Rated: R (language, drug content, some sexuality and a scene of
violence) 
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Trying to be a ``Midnight Express'' for the '90s, ``Return to
Paradise'' is a misfire instead. It at least has more ambition than
most films. Also to its credit, it isn't predictable. But it never
catches us up in its issues or what it means to persuade us are its
passions. Taken from a French film, ``Force Majeure,'' it begins
with a scene that fills you with dread because you know that the
three young Americans on the loose in Malaysia are courting
disaster when they grow heedless about local customs as they bomb
around Penang, drinking, whoring, and buying drugs cheap.
</P>
<P>
   They seem to have escaped without harming themselves when we see
Vince Vaughn's more experienced leader say goodbye to David
Conrad's shy young architect and Joaquin Phoenix's Greenpeace
activist, on his way to save orangutans. Then, two years later, the
ax falls. Vaughn, a cynical limo driver, and Conrad, now an
up-and-coming architect, get word that the young naturalist never
made it out of Malaysia. When a rented bike that Vaughn discarded
brought the irate bicycle shop owner to their rented house,
accompanied by police, they found a brick of discarded hashish
there. Phoenix's gentle idealist was arrested, tried as a drug
dealer, and condemned to die.
</P>
<P>
   The only way he can be saved, his lawyer informs the two men she
tracked down in New York, is for them to go back and share the
blame, changing the sentence from death for one to prison terms for
all three. They're informed by their convicted companion's lawyer _
Anne Heche _ that they have eight days to act before the sentence
is carried out. So the clock starts ticking on their guilt.
Complicating the crisis-of-conscience drama is the career agenda of
an ambitious reporter played in career-stretching fashion by Jada
Pinkett Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Heche's lawyer fears that if Pinkett's journalist trumpets the
story around the world things will go worse for her client. She
cites precedent _ the Malaysian caning incident, when an American
youth was caned despite protests because Malaysian police were
angry at being pressured from outside. So Heche tries to get the
reporter to cool it while working on the limo driver and architect.
It might have worked if the film had stuck to its original
imperatives and not veered off into a totally unconvincing
escalation of passions between the lawyer and one of the
codefendants.
</P>
<P>
   The film almost blasts past its dramaturgical shortcomings once
the scene shifts to Malaysia. Justice takes a surprising turn that
makes the jailed member of the trio seem more sympathetic, more of
a victim as he sits in his hellhole of a cell awaiting his fate.
Vaughn, Heche, and Phoenix throw themselves at their assignments.
But that's the problem. They just seem like actors carrying out
assignments, with the script throwing even greater odds against
them than the harsh Malaysian government does.

GREAT LOOKING `FIRST LOVE' FAILS TO ENGAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
FIRST LOVE, LAST RITES 
Directed by: Jesse Peretz 
Written by: David Ryan (based a Ian McEwan short story.) 
Starring: Natasha Gregson Wagner, Giovanni Ribisi, Robert John
Burke, Jeannetta Arnette, Donal Logue, Eli Marienthal 
Running time: 93 minutes 
Unrated 
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The steamy Louisiana bayou atmosphere runs so thick and heavy in
``First Love, Last Rites,'' it almost masks the fact that there's
very little going on here. Jesse Peretz's languorous first feature
sets its sights on the well-worn topic of first love, and all the
unexpected bumps that a virgin heart encounters along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Natasha Gregson Wagner and Giovanni Ribisi certainly make a
photogenic young couple, and Peretz spends plenty of time capturing
the erotic blush of this new love. With a mattress propped on a
table, the two engage in all kinds of slow, passionate, dreamy
lovemaking.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, those seem to be the best of times for the couple.
Wagner's Sissel and Ribisi's Joey are a bit of a mismatch. Sissel
is moody and Southern, and Joey is an easygoing kid from Brooklyn.
They spend much of their time in a one-room house on stilts, trying
to tolerate visits from Sissel's relentlessly obnoxious little
brother Adrian (Eli Marienthal) and Joey's eel-trapping
get-rich-quick scheme with Sissel's father, Henry (Robert John
Burke).
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the rat, and its insistent scratching within the
walls of the house. That rodent _ and he's a big sucker who could
give Boston's best a run for their money _ pops up in several dream
sequences. It is a clumsy symbol for all the gnawing doubts and
uncertainties in a relationship that is never as stable in upright
positions as it is when Sissel and Joey are getting horizontal.
</P>
<P>
   The film is based on a 1975 short story by Ian McEwan, and
perhaps this just worked better on the written page. The film,
though beautifully filmed, is as often stagnant as Louisiana swamp.
There's no dramatic momentum, and the film repeatedly sags when it
should soar.
</P>
<P>
   Wagner and especially Ribisi are intriguing young actors.
(Ribisi's talents are put to greater use as an Army medic in
``Saving Private Ryan''). With his sleepy eyes and sad smile,
Ribisi nails the confusion of a young man who believes he's in
love, but doesn't know what love is.
</P>
<P>
   Wagner is appropriately mercurial, loving and needy one moment,
then distant and sour the next. Her Sissel is not yet quite a
woman, but she already understands the spells she can cast on a man
with just one look. Wagner is an actress to watch, and yes, she
inherited the limpid beauty of her late mother, Natalie Wood.

LIBERTY COS. BUYS ANOTHER ASSET FIRM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE BAILEY AND STEVEN SYRE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is this the way to build a money management empire?
</P>
<P>
   Liberty Financial Cos. of Boston struck its latest deal in a
summer shopping spree yesterday by acquiring Societe Generale Asset
Management Corp., which invests $5 billion, and its star money
manager Jean-Marie Eveillard. Price tag: up to $216 million.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, Liberty Financial has spent $147.5 million to
purchase Crabbe Huson Group, which manages about $5.3 billion, and
bought Progress Investment Management Co., overseeing $2.5 billion,
for an undisclosed sum.
</P>
<P>
   These firms will be added to the group of money managers Liberty
has already collected, including Colonial Group, Stein Roe &AMP;
Farnham, and Newport Pacific Management Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The stable of firms, which manage a combined $54 billion, make
up about half of Liberty's business. The rest is generated by the
company's big annuity operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've really built out a very full and, we think, a robust
product line,'' said Liberty Financial's chief executive, Ken
Leibler.
</P>
<P>
   Robust could be a stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Liberty Financial filled a long-standing gap in its money
manager lineup by acquiring SoGen, a diversified international
investor, and Eveillard, one of the few marquee names in the field.
</P>
<P>
   But Liberty Financial also will buy a company that has struggled
in recent times, a recurring theme in its acquisitions this year.
The firms pursued by Liberty Financial may be part of a smart
long-term plan, but they have a habit of limping to the table.
</P>
<P>
   Eveillard's SoGen International, a mutual fund that contains
most of the firm's assets under management, has lost 1.5 percent
over the last year and ranks in the last quarter of the global fund
field for 1-, 3- and 5-year performances, according to Lipper
Analytical Services Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Performance has taken a toll on SoGen's business recently. The
New York-based company managed net sales of $70 million last year
but has seen shareholder redemptions outpace new sales by $650
million through the first half of 1998, according to Financial
Research Corp., a Boston-based firm.
</P>
<P>
   SoGen recorded net sales of more than $1 billion in the better
days of 1996. The company is the US mutual funds unit of Societe
Generale SA, one of France's largest banks.
</P>
<P>
   Leibler describes the problems as a short-term setback for a
proven and popular manager. Some outsiders agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jean-Marie Eveillards come around every few years and they
were able to nail this one,'' said Burton Greenwald, an industry
consultant based in Philadelphia. ``When the tide changes, it will
pay off big-time for Liberty.''
</P>
<P>
   An even stronger investment tide was working against Crabbe
Huson when it struck a deal with Liberty Financial in June. The
firm, once a hot shop with a value-oriented investment style _
picking stocks it believes are underpriced and will appreciate over
time _ has been crushed in the otherwise strong stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Its Crabbe Huson Special fund has lost 36.1 percent in the last
year, ranking it dead last among 291 mid-capitalization funds
tracked by Lipper. The Crabbe Huson Small Cap fund has lost 24.8
percent in the same period, worse than all but two of 540 funds in
its category, according to Lipper.
</P>
<P>
   Customers pulled about $140 million out of Crabbe Huson's mutual
funds in the first half of this year, following net redemptions of
about $130 million last year, according to Financial Research Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Leibler said the bulk of Crabbe Huson's business, managing about
$4 billion for institutional clients, has actually been growing. He
said the firm's performance has suffered only because its
investment style fell out of favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think value will have its day, as it always has had
historically,'' Leibler said.
</P>
<P>
   Liberty Financial had been in the hunt for yet another
well-known mutual fund firm with slumping short-term results in the
spring. The company was widely reported, in this column and
elsewhere, to be leading the chase for the $6.1 billion Kaufmann
fund. Eventually, all the companies pursuing the fund lost
interest.
</P>
<P>
   Liberty Financial has experience waiting for investment trends
to turn around. Colonial, a Boston-based bond shop, was its first
big purchase, in 1994, and fixed-income investments have been out
of favor ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Colonial sales exceeded redemptions by $178 million in the
second quarter this year. But it was the first quarter since early
1991 in which customers gave the company more money than they
pulled out.
</P>
<P>
   Newport Pacific Management, a well-known name among Asian-stock
mutual fund firms, was on a roll when it was acquired by Liberty
Financial. But the Asian stock collapse of the last year has put
the brakes on new business.
</P>
<P>
   Another big Liberty Financial unit, growth-stock manager Stein
Roe, attracted net sales last year. But sales have roughly equaled
redemptions in the first half of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always nice if you can buy something that's doing
phenomenally well at that second,'' said Leibler. ``But we are more
long-term investors. We are putting together investment
capabilities'' to carry the company through all types of investment
cycles.

RENOWNED CHILDREN'S AUTHOR INSPIRES RESPECT FOR ANIMALS 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CARLA BENNETT  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORFOLK, Va. _ More than a thousand people recently gathered in
Oxford and Cambridge, England, to celebrate C.S. Lewis. This
brilliant author and scholar _ famous for his children's books,
including the ``Chronicles of Narnia,'' his religious writings,
including ``Mere Christianity,'' and countless books and articles
about ethics _ richly deserves the praise.
</P>
<P>
   Though he died 35 years ago, every one of his books remains in
print. A few years ago, Sir Anthony Hopkins portrayed Lewis in the
acclaimed film ``Shadowlands.''
</P>
<P>
   But I wonder how many of those gathered in England know he was
an advocate for animal rights.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Problem of Pain,'' Lewis renounces experiments on
animals. ``Vivisection,'' he writes, ``can only be defended by
showing it to be right that one species should suffer in order that
another species be happier .... If we cut up beasts simply because
they cannot prevent us, and because we are backing our own side in
the struggle for existence, it is only logical to cut up imbeciles,
criminals, enemies or capitalists for the same reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   In the years since Lewis' death, the experimentation industry
has become a mega-conglomerate that uses up and kills more than 60
million animals a year to get billions of dollars in government and
private grants.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you don't agree with Lewis' view of vivisection, don't
be fooled into thinking that all research on animals is meant to
save human lives. It seems that experimenters dream up new
``research'' in order to pay their mortgages. They have rotated
kittens' eyeballs, then made them jump from a high platform onto a
plank in a pan of water (University of Oregon); sewn rabbits'
eyelids closed, chained them in stocks, shocked them and given them
LSD (University of Maryland); shocked squirrel monkeys in
fear-conditioning chambers (Stanford University); shocked rats'
feet until the animals reached a pathetic state of ``learned
helplessness,'' and scalded their tails with hot water (University
of North Carolina); harnessed cats fitted with ``cranial implants''
to treadmills and subjected them to tail and paw shocks, producing
loud cries and ``excessive struggling''; and on and on and on.
</P>
<P>
   C.S. Lewis warned in the ``The Screwtape Letters'' that
worldliness can gradually corrupt a person's soul. I think he would
say that experimenters have become corrupt to their very essence.
But what would he say about those who accept this wholesale torture
by remaining silent on the issue?
</P>
<P>
   I think Lewis would be pleased if the scholars who traveled to
Oxford and Cambridge to honor his work chose to pay attention to
his view of animals and experimentation. I think he would be
pleased if we all did. It would go a long way toward renewing the
soul of mankind.

WHAT PRICE MAUGHAM? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's how Howard Gotlieb, the always amusing director of Boston
University's Special Collections library, explains his heterodox
collecting tastes: ``Yale got the 18th century, Harvard got the
19th century. That left me the 20th century.'' So Gotlieb has been
gobbling up the ephemera of our time.
</P>
<P>
   Through Gotlieb _ who does not like the nickname I once assigned
him, ``The Vacuum Cleaner'' _ BU has acquired a ragtag collection
of stuff: a Carl Hiaasen manuscript, Fred Astaire's dancing shoes,
and works from Hank Ketcham, creator of Dennis the Menace. As I
write, Gotlieb is assembling a trove of ``documents'' from Shirley
MacLaine. (To be fair, the university also has huge archives from
Martin Luther King and Albert Einstein.) Just recently, Gotlieb
came away with something of genuine literary merit: one of the
largest collections of Somerset Maugham letters and manuscripts
ever sold.
</P>
<P>
   Gotlieb is boasting that he got quite a deal, and he did. Don't
ask me why, but among collectors of first editions and literary
artifacts, Maugham is ``out.'' James Joyce, Graham Greene, Agatha
Christie, and the like still command high prices. But at Sotheby's
huge Maugham sale, several prize items found no buyers, including a
draft manuscript of his autobiography and a letter in which the
homosexual Maugham accuses his wife of ``terrorizing'' him.
</P>
<P>
   Bidding surreptitiously by phone from his office in Boston,
Gotlieb bought five major lots containing hundreds of Maugham
letters and documents for under $200,000. Says Sotheby's Vice
President Marsha Malinowski, ``He got some very good buys for BU.''
</P>
<P>
   Look for a Maugham exhibit in the fall.

Waltham's National Managed Health Care Congress when she asked for
a day off to raise money for the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute by
running in the Boston Marathon. (A Dana-Farber doctor had treated
Thistle's mother.)
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, things turned out fine for Thistle. After I
wrote about her plight, she was deluged with media calls. I gave
her one free piece of public relations advice: Return the call from
the Associated Press, which services every news outlet in the
country. She did, and moments later I saw her on the ``Today'' show
with Matt Lauer.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the exposure, Thistle says she raised an additional
$5,000 for Dana-Farber. She also received over 100 offers for job
interviews and now has a job with a company that promotes
health-care programs. What about the guy who fired her? NMHCC
executive Steve Toman didn't return my call.

   One of mall developer Steve Weiner's most alluring new
investments _ the gorgeous remodeling of 27 Commonwealth Ave.,
which was once a dormitory for nurses at Mass. General _ is under
water. Well, the garage took on several feet of water during the
June floods, ``impacting'' (my word, not theirs) some luxury cars
parked there. Everyone assures me that new pumps have been
installed, which should forestall any future water damage under the
building. The nurses are long gone, and 27 Comm has been broken up

   Former Christian Science Monitor editor Kay Fanning has holed up
in Anchorage to work on a memoir of her years in journalism. It
could be quite a tale, rivaling or even outstripping the recently
published autobiography of journalism's Other Katharine, Ms. Graham
of Washington Post renown.
</P>
<P>
   Once the wife of jillionaire Marshall Field Jr., Fanning hied
off to Alaska in 1965, bought the Anchorage Daily News, and married
Chicago newspaper editor Larry Fanning. After her husband's death
in 1971, Fanning ran the Anchorage paper and won a Pulitzer Prize.
A convert to Christian Science, she left Alaska in 1983 to become
editor of the Monitor for five tumultuous years. Fanning may have
some scores to settle with former Christian Science bigwigs, but I
doubt she will use her memoir to that end. That's not what Science
is about, and that's not what Kay Fanning is about.

FOR BOWEN, NBA LOCKOUT RICH IN IRONY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   By now, spaces such as this one should be filled with NBA
debates. We could all be arguing about how we don't understand the
Celtics' fascination with Matt Geiger. Or why the team even
considered trading Ron Mercer before the draft. We could even
pretend to be know-it-all owners, suggesting to Paul Gaston how
much money he should spend, if any, on Antoine Walker.
</P>
<P>
   At least we would be having a conversation. Leaders of the NBA
Players Association can't say that. Neither can NBA owners.
Representatives of both went to a meeting last week and acted as if
they were crazed children of Bill Gates, obnoxious rich kids
scuffling over billions of dollars. When somebody couldn't get
their way _ who really cares who it was? _ the story is that
representatives of the league picked up their metaphorical ball, in
this case million-dollar paperwork, and went home.
</P>
<P>
   And that's all we see, isn't it? Owners incapable of saying what
kids say every day: ``Peace.'' Players believing they are selling
themselves out if they whisper the phrase, ``We have enough.'' You
would think that basketball's heart beats inside an antiseptic
monster, cursed with no soul and capable only of babbling, ``I love
this game.'' You would think that the only life coursing through
the monster is a love of money, houses, cars, and groupies. Perhaps
you saw the league's transparent PR move of giving money back, with
interest, to season ticket-holders if games are missed, as if the
owners didn't initiate the lockout. Maybe you are close to thinking
that all players are tangled in the cash-driven monsoon that has
characterized the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Then you talk to a man named Bruce Bowen.
</P>
<P>
   Bowen is the very human NBA face often lost in the boring
bluster over licensing rights, three-year guaranteed rookie
contracts, and Larry Bird Exceptions. The 6-foot-7-inch Celtics
forward-guard is the eldest of four children. Many days this
summer, he has been at his parents' home in Long Beach, Calif.,
making sure his siblings _ 21, 20, and 17 _ are doing all right
when his parents aren't home. Bowen grossed $425,000 last year, the
most money he has ever made. A strong Christian who lives by the
tithing instructions in the Bible's Book of Malachi (giving 10
percent of your income), Bowen immediately gave $42,000 to the
church pastored by his father. ``I thank God I was even in a
position to do that,'' he said. ``That money belongs to him.''
</P>
<P>
   That's easy to say when you are a rich man; Bowen is not rich.
That's not to suggest you will see him outside Store 24 tomorrow
asking for spare change. But he has a few things in common with
many basketball fans: He is ready for the games to start; he knows
what it means to save and budget his money; and if his employers
don't invite him back to work soon, he's not ashamed to go looking
for work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a few friends who own different businesses,'' he said.
``If I needed to, I wouldn't have a problem going to them and
saying, `Hey, I'm in a tight spot right now. Can you help me
out?'''
</P>
<P>
   It's ironic: Bowen plays in the NBA, but no one is truly
speaking for him. Yes, he is a part of the Players Association like
everyone else. And he says all the right things, pointing out that
the group is more unified now than it was three years ago. But
there are many players who are vacationing around the world right
now, living off endorsement money. Bowen? The other day, he was at
his parents' house trying to devise a plan to use the phone before
his sisters secured it for who knows how long. There are many
owners playing round after round of golf, getting labor updates on
their cell phones. Bowen stays in shape by running with his cousin
Terry and goes down the road to Fresno and uses the facilities
there.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a rich man's tale:
</P>
<P>
   During the 1996-97 season, Bowen took the money he earned with
the Miami Heat _ about $30,000 _ and put some of it in a
certificate of deposit. His plan then was to pay bills, budget
money, and find another job. You have heard a lot about guaranteed
contracts. Bowen's deal was not guaranteed. So he played in the
summer, hoping someone would see him. Celtics general manager Chris
Wallace did, and the team signed him last July. His first Celtics
paycheck wasn't due until Nov. 15. He didn't want to, but he had to
take money from his CD before Nov. 15.
</P>
<P>
   We all understand that there are families around the country who
survive on a tenth of Bowen's income. Bowen understands that, too.
But he has not lost sight of what money is during this six-week
lockout, a lockout many predict will last until December.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still can't get over a check I had to write last year,''
said Bowen, who makes nearly $2 million less than the average NBA
player. ``I was buying my place in Boston. The seller said, `That
will be $16,893.' I said, `You mean $1,600-something?' And she said
it again. I couldn't believe it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, I value the dollar. Some of my teammates can drop $1,000
like it's nothing. I still look kind of funny at $50. Some guys are
at the point where they don't really have to budget. I'm not like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   He thought about that many times when Cedric Maxwell nicknamed
him ``Dangerfield'' because NBA officials didn't give him any
respect when it came to calls last season. He thought about it for
a while because there is a price to be paid for mouthing off to
officials. Get three technicals and you're already out $1,500. Or
think of it this way: Walker has cost himself $15,000 in two
seasons for snapping at officials. Bowen was fined once last season
_ ``I was one minute late'' _ and was sick about it.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA and its players should be sick about something else.
Baseball was resuscitated this year by the home run. If the games
stop, what will revive basketball? The dunk? The 3-point shot? A
retired Michael Jordan? And so the lockout rages on. It is a
private party. If you are a basketball fan, have warm flesh, and
know what it means to worry about next month's rent, you'll never
understand how either side can say it loves its game.

VINEYARD STILL OFFERS SOME HAVENS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   VINEYARD HAVEN, Mass. _ ``Is that the Black Dog?'' the girl asks
her mother as they wait near the ferry dock where an old Labrador
retriever is cooling off with a harbor swim.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he is,'' says the mother as the rotund old canine,
wearing a red kerchief, slowly emerges from the water and shakes
off unapologetically. ``That's the Black Dog.''
</P>
<P>
   Here we are in the heart of darkness. The belly of the beast.
And, paying $20 for a T-shirt with a black lab on the front. The
bite here is definitely worse than the bark.
</P>
<P>
   This is the other end of Martha's Vineyard, the plainer side.
The story here is about how a quaint, dry (alcohol-free) village
with one restaurant, some oil tanks, and an authentic wooden
boatworks produced the hippest logo at this or any summer resort.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, the T-shirt and logo make Vineyard Haven a hipper
place than upper-crust Edgartown, which plays these days like a
maritime mansion theme park with no parking.
</P>
<P>
   And hey, wasn't that Margaret Thatcher and Nancy Reagan lunching
aboard Malcolm Forbes's old yacht the other day not far from where
Shenandoah and Alabama _ Vineyard Haven's resident schooners _ are
moored?
</P>
<P>
   As logos go, you have to look to Vermont, to Ben &AMP; Jerry's
dappled cows, to find the Black Dog's equal, and aside from Maine's
rather generic boiled lobster (usually shown on a place mat with a
bed of fries), there's nothing even close anywhere in New England
to the Black Dog.
</P>
<P>
   Which is nothing to brag about, except in the Chamber of
Commerce sense. For it was not that many years ago that Martha's
Vineyard rang in the ears of outdoors folks as something close to
paradise. It was a laid-back but quite civilized island with a
serene feel and a modest offer of the best fishing, swimming,
biking, boating, beaching in all of New England. (No, not golf. You
would not come to the Vineyard for the golf any more than you would
the food, says an island newspaper friend.)
</P>
<P>
   But now all of New York and much of Washington have discovered
the island and pounce on it heavily each August, with the real
ooomph coming next week with the Clinton entourage. Which is why
some restaurants (sorry, ristorantes) on the island charge $7 each
for an a la carte salad and baked potato to go with your $27
entree.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for Martha's Vineyard outdoor purists who watch with
dismay the traffic jams that mimic Callahan Tunnel mayhem, there
are essences of the old Vineyard to be found in hidden pockets.
</P>
<P>
   As a general guideline, you will be happier, freer, and find
access to almost everything without a car on the Vineyard. Take or
rent bikes instead; a small boat is ideal.
</P>
<P>
   BEACHERS &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Forget South Beach with its crowds, undertow, and vicious
riptides. There are alternatives, though some get a little tricky
because so many of the island's beaches are closed to the public.
Here are a few of the best swimming and sunbathing beaches on the
island, which are best accessed by bikers or hikers.
</P>
<P>
   _Find the westerly back road route (get a map) from Vineyard
Haven to Tashmoo Lake. The tide flows through a pair of jetties,
and on the near side is a white sand beach overlooking Vineyard
Sound with clean, lovely swimming. Or, just before reaching Tashmoo
along the packed dirt road from town, take the right fork to
another spot on the same shore, Wilfred Pond.
</P>
<P>
   _On the other side of Vineyard Haven Harbor, ride Beach Road
heading toward Oak Bluffs. About a quarter of a mile past the
Lagoon Pond drawbridge, take a left down the public way to the
beach. Clean swimming and fine beaching in a fairly secluded spot.
</P>
<P>
   _In Oak Bluffs, ride down East Chop Drive past the boat club and
onto the sand. Plunk down on the beach near the jetty to the north
side of the Oak Bluffs Harbor channel. This is clean, fast-moving
water, and the beach is soft (few rocks), and sandy white.
</P>
<P>
   _East Beach in Edgartown. This beach is secluded and often empty
because it takes some effort to get there. This long sweep of beach
in the Wasque Point Reservation can give you privacy on a white
sand beach and clean, fast-moving Nantucket Sound water that seems
impossible on the crowded Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   HIKERS &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Even though the ugliest element on the Vineyard is the auto
traffic, once you're a few yards off the beaten track on any of the
several nature trails, the world really does fade away. The effort
to preserve the island's wilderness has been serious and effective.
Start with a conservation map of the Vineyard and try the following
walks:
</P>
<P>
   _Chappaquiddick, the southeast barrier island on the Vineyard,
is easy to reach by ferry and has 700 acres of refuge land that
draws all manner of shore birds and inland residents such as wild
turkey. Wasque Reservation and Cape Pogue Wildlife Refuge will keep
you busy all day, with a nearby beach to finish with a swim.
</P>
<P>
   _West Chop Woods, off Franklin Street in Vineyard Haven, has 80
acres.
</P>
<P>
   _Menemsha Hills Reservation, off North Road in Chilmark,
features 200 acres of varied upland terrain, including the beach on
the southwest shore.
</P>
<P>
   _Long Point Wildlife Refuge, on Waldron Bottom Road in West
Tisbury, is a tract with more than 600 wilderness acres.
</P>
<P>
   In all cases, use the maps available at the ferry dock and most
of the above outdoor alternatives _ and many more _ will give you a
good sense of the Vineyard before it became the hippest take in New
England.
</P>
<P>
   And again, do everyone a favor, including yourself, and leave
the car home.

WATERING THE APPLE: TUNNEL IS FOR THE AGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Deep beneath the Earth's surface _ 60 stories deep _
the workers in Shaft Number 19-B drill through some of the hardest
bedrock that anyone has ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   Around the clock, in three shifts of eight hours, they are
building New York's City Water Tunnel Number 3, a $6 billion,
60-mile-long bit of urban infrastructure that officials say ranks
as the largest construction project in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The first segment of the tunnel, which spans 13 miles, was
turned on to great fanfare Thursday, gushing forth water at a
pressure of 350 pounds per square inch.
</P>
<P>
   When finished, about 20 years from now, the tunnel will not only
be the longest in the world, but will complete one of the world's
most massive engineering marvels _ yet, being entirely underground,
perhaps also the least-noticed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I often ask New Yorkers if they know where their water comes
from,'' said Joel A. Miele, commissioner of the Department of
Environmental Protection, which runs the tunnel and all the city's
water projects. ``No more than 6 to 8 percent have the slightest
idea.''
</P>
<P>
   The water for all three tunnels _ Tunnels Number 1 and 2 were
built in 1917 and 1936, respectively _ comes from as far as 125
miles away, north of the city, coaxed out of the Croton, Delaware
and Catskill Reservoirs along the Hudson River.
</P>
<P>
   Wending through an elaborate system of aqueducts, tunnels, and
smaller reservoirs, the water streams into Yonkers, down through
the Bronx, then off through various other tunnels and pipes into
Manhattan, Queens, Brooklyn, and Staten Island.
</P>
<P>
   Tunnels Number 1 and 2 carry, together, 1.5 billion gallons of
water a day _ 95 percent of it without any pumps, flowing along by
simple force of gravity.
</P>
<P>
   New York City consumes nearly every drop of this water. This led
officials to start planning a third tunnel as far back as the
mid-1950s. Not until 1970 did construction begin _ and not until
2020 is it expected to end.
</P>
<P>
   Shaft 19-B, plunging 672 feet below a far-flung industrial site
in a decrepit area along the Brooklyn-Queens border, leads into a
stretch of Tunnel Number 3's Second Stage, which is not due to come
on line for seven years or so.
</P>
<P>
   A few reporters were allowed down in the shaft Wednesday
afternoon between shifts. The narrow elevator takes two minutes to
hit bottom. (The ride back up is three minutes.) Then you step out
into a vast cavern dug out from the rock.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing remotely claustrophobic about the space, a
cylinder 23 feet in diameter. A constant flow of air is pumped
through a huge tube on the ceiling. Smaller pipes on the walls
carry water. Railroad tracks have been laid on the floor, to bring
the workers to the outer reaches of their drilling, now three miles
away from the shaft. Conveyor belts stretch overhead, carrying the
busted-up rocks back up to the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Tunnel Number 3 has taken the lives of 23 workers in its 28
years of construction, but all but one of the deaths were caused by
accidents typical of industrial projects _ falls, electrocutions,
collapsing equipment.
</P>
<P>
   No one fears a cave-in of the tunnel itself. The rock that
surrounds it was formed 450 million years ago, long before life
began on this planet. It's as solid as anything. But just in case,
eight-foot-long bolts have been hammered into the arc of the
cylinder, the tunnel's ceiling, for extra stability.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the life-support gear and the constant clanking of
the pump and the chugging of the motor, the scene feels like
another planet. The ground is muddy like clay. The walls are
craggly, made of a rock that nobody has ever seen before.
</P>
<P>
   The rough sections of the tunnel were created the old-fashioned
way _ by sandhogs, as the workers called themselves, wielding
dynamite and hand drills.
</P>
<P>
   Then you approach a newer area _ built in just the past two
years _ when the workers were given the Tunnel-Boring Machine, a
110-foot-long, worm-like device, spinning 50 huge cutters on a
rotating head, that digs into the rock with 3.5 million pounds of
thrust, capable of pushing forward at a rate of 15 feet per hour.
</P>
<P>
   The cylinders that the machine have dug out are smooth and
symmetrical. One finished section, which has been lined with
concrete, glistens in the arc lights. The project's resident
engineer, Ami Mukherjee, seemed jaded by the effect. ``That's what
concrete looks like when it's wet,'' he said nonchalantly. But,
seen for the first time, it seems surreally spectacular, like a
high-tech aircraft-hangar that somehow wound up on the moon.
</P>
<P>
   Shaft 19-B is twice as deep as any part of the city's first two
water tunnels, but even it stops short of Tunnel Number 3's deepest
point _ an area under Roosevelt Island, just east of Manhattan,
that goes 780 feet underground.
</P>
<P>
   That segment of the tunnel is part of the 13-mile stretch that
opened Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, according to Commissioner Miele, Tunnel Number 3,
First Phase, has been flowing with water for three weeks now. ``You
can't expect us to have opening ceremonies without making sure it's
all right,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But in New York City these days, no official event happens until
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani declares it so. The mayor made the
pronouncement Thursday at a grand ceremony near the Central Park
reservoir, with fireworks, music and, earlier in the day, a
memorial service for those who died while building the tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   Like cracking a champagne bottle to commemorate the launching of
a ship, Giuliani turned on a spigot that activated an 80-foot-high
fountain _ and, thus was Water Tunnel Number 3 deemed officially
open.
</P>
<P>
   The Central Park fountain was first turned on in 1917, with the
opening of Tunnel Number 1, but was immediately turned off and
forgotten about. City officials rediscovered it just six months
ago, hooked its pipes up to Tunnel Number 3, and decided to turn it
on again for symbolic effect.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani liked the idea so much, he decided to keep the fountain
gushing all the time, as a publicly visible monument to the maze of
metal and mud carved through the prehistoric rock down under.

IN BOSTON PUBLIC GARDEN, THE THIEF IS MIGHTIER THAN THE SWORD 
</HEADLINE>

 By BRIAN MACQUARRIE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ General George Washington cuts an imposing figure as he
sits astride his prancing warhorse in the Public Garden. Proud,
patriotic, determined to prevail.
</P>
<P>
   Problem is, the father of our country can't hold on to his
sword.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Charlestown sculptor Thomas Ball completed the bronze
statue in 1869, Washington's sword has been ``liberated'' many
times by pranksters and petty vandals.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the thefts have become so routine that the latest
sword, installed last month, is made of plastic and expected to be
only a temporary adornment.
</P>
<P>
   ``How long it will stay this time is a matter of speculation,''
said Henry Lee, president of the Friends of the Public Garden, with
a slight laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was perhaps a rite of passage for fraternities or some such
groups to climb up and take the sword. I think it's probably been
removed many dozens of times.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington has faced other assaults at his post near Arlington
Street and Commonwealth Avenue. Whitewash was used to deface the
statue about a half-dozen years ago, and flourescent paint has been
used periodically to highlight the horse's undercarriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it wasn't a public monument and very valuable, it might be
very funny,'' said Fran Beatty, senior landscape architect for the
city's historic parks.
</P>
<P>
   But as embarrassing as the flourescent touch-up is, holding on
to the sword is a bigger problem for Washington, who undoubtedly
had no such trouble when he assumed command of the Continental Army
in Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's plight is shared by the nearby likeness of Civil
War hero Robert Gould Shaw, commander of the gallant 54th
Massachusetts Regiment, the Union's first black infantry unit. &UR;  &LR; 
Shaw's sword, part of Augustus Saint-Gaudens' masterpiece memorial
on Boston Common, has been as popular as Washington's as a prize
for pilferers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've told people at the Washington statue and the Shaw
memorial that they better look fast, because the sword might not be
there next time,'' Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the original bronze sword held across Washington's
body has had a succession of inferior reincarnations of wood and
plastic. At one time, Lee said, a Boston Art Commission official
kept several replacement swords, waiting for their call to arms,
stacked behind his desk.
</P>
<P>
   City park officials are skittish about describing how the swords
are attached to the sculptures. But it is clear that welding them
in place is not the preferred option. If the choices are no sword
or a nub of a sword, the former seems preferable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way bronze is cast, the sword had to be a separate item
and inserted to make it look realistic,'' Beatty said. Since the
thefts began, she said, the city has faced this difficult question:
``Do you fasten it so hard so it can't be taken off, and does that
set yourself up for someone who is very determined?''
</P>
<P>
   The patrons of the Public Garden know about determination. In
December 1988, a thief used an acetylene torch to separate a bronze
duckling from his mother and siblings at the other end of the park.
</P>
<P>
   The theft caused an uproar among Bostonians who had become
enamored of the sculpted tribute to Robert McCloskey's children's
book ``Make Way for Ducklings.'' To the rescue came bartenders
Eddie Doyle of the Bull and Finch Pub and Tommy Leonard of the
Eliot Lounge, who launched a button campaign that raised $5,000 and
replaced the Nancy Schon statue only four months later.
</P>
<P>
   Another example of misguided persistence occurred in the Fens'
Rose Garden, where someone lopped off the hands from a carrara
marble statue. A new, graceful pair of hands have been attached to
``Desconsol,'' said Mildred Farrell, director of the city-funded
Boston Art Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Such vandalism is difficult to stop, officials said. Park
rangers do not patrol 24 hours a day, and police have more
important duties than keeping an all-night eye on Washington and
his sculpted brethren.
</P>
<P>
   And, truth be told, Bostonians behave quite well toward their
statuary. ``Generally, the monuments are much respected by the
public and there is surprisingly little vandalism,'' Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   The same attitude applies to the Public Garden as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the '70s, things were very bad. Several small statues were
stolen; vandalism was rife,'' Lee said. ``But we have had better
work by the Parks Department, the Friends of the Public Garden
deserve some credit, and the public deserves a good deal of credit,
too.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are few places in our country, or any country, that are
open 24 hours a day, unprotected, and greatly used. I think the
public in Boston is remarkably caring about their Garden.''
</P>
<P>
   And remarkably affectionate toward certain pieces of public art:
the Red Auerbach statue in Quincy Market, for example, and the
Boston Massacre monument on the Common.
</P>
<P>
   Both objects tend to be touched so often that their surfaces
have been rubbed shiny. On the Common, the outstretched hand of one
massacre victim is considered lucky by many passersby.
</P>
<P>
   But Lee, whose group also helps preserve the Common's monuments,
is not concerned about such wear and tear.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's love, not vandalism,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, if it's possible to love a sword _ but not too much.

`STELLA' MOVES TO AN EASY GROOVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
HOW STELLA GOT HER GROOVE BACK 
Directed by: Kevin Rodney Sullivan 
Screenplay by: Terry McMillan &AMP; Ron Bass (based on McMillan's
novel) 
Starring: Angela Bassett, Whoopi Goldberg, Taye Diggs, Regina King,
Suzzanne Douglas, Michael J. Pagan 
Running time: 116 minutes 
Rated: R (language and some sexuality) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Glossy romantic fantasy doesn't get any glossier than ``How
Stella Got Her Groove Back,'' Terry McMillan's slick and seductive
if not quite soulful semi-autobiographical follow-up to ``Waiting
to Exhale.'' Like her first novel-to-film, this one is dedicated to
the proposition that upmarket black visibility has been
ridiculously lacking in films from the Hollywood assembly line. If
the first film showed Hollywood what it had been missing by letting
Angela Bassett floor it with a couple of equally high-powered
girlfriends, this one reminds us that she can carry a film herself,
with a little help from the Jamaica Tourist Board, a hunky but
sensitive newcomer with a dazzling smile, and a string of sassy
one-liners from Whoopi Goldberg in a sidekick role.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike some movie queens, Bassett projects warmth and dignity as
well as beauty. She has an enticing way of smiling a slow-release
smile inspired by some secret that is being kept private _ except
from us in the audience. The film does ask us to make a few
longer-than-usual leaps. The first is that Bassett's high-powered
single mom and workaholic San Francisco financial district diva
would stop hawking bonds long enough to let one Jamaica tourism TV
commercial send her flying off to the Hop-py Island when she's
freed up by her son's annual two-weeker with his dad. She'd like a
little adventure, and the fact that she's accompanied by her
extremely frank girlfriend allows her to be perceived as the demure
one.
</P>
<P>
   After a couple of comic misadventures involving two would-be
wild and crazy guys, Bassett's Stella finds she's being flirted
with at breakfast by a polite but definitely hunky young local.
She's appalled to find how young _ he's 20, she's 40. But with the
distinct possibility of a sexual reawakening in the air, she lets
herself be implored by the well-spoken young man. Nothing bursts
the bubble of this feel-good fantasy. It's the visual equivalent of
an easy-listening station. The young man is not only well-bred, but
intelligent, sensitive, and in some ways more mature than his
years. More to the point, we believe in the chemistry that begins
to emerge between Bassett and Taye Diggs's passionate but poised
romancer.
</P>
<P>
   We can believe in the gravitational pull between the two
characters _ and with a long-overdue difference. In a summer
hitherto largely devoted to older men getting much younger women,
this film reverses the pattern, frankly and amusingly turning
Diggs's playful yet essentially serious Winston Shakespeare into
the sex object here. It's a strategy that peaks in a shower scene
when Stella watches the unwitting Winston soaping up and finds she
can't resist opening the glass door and keeping him company. For
Diggs, this film debut represents a quantum leap forward from his
role as the landlord in the lugubrious musical ``Rent.'' His
gravity and his smile insure that we'll be seeing more of him.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, though, Winston just stands around with his face hanging
out while Stella undergoes the roller-coaster rides. She's called
to New York for a crisis, then finds, once home in Marin County,
that her company's sale to a larger one has suddenly left her
jobless. But while the script makes a pass at drama, there's never
any real conflict. It's all a bit too smooth and trouble-free, even
for a spun-sugar fantasy. There's the merest suggestion of sisterly
rivalry with Regina King's ambulance-driving, mouthy sibling,
Suzzanne Douglas's sister is worried that Stella's questionable
impulsiveness in pursuing a romance with a younger man will impede
her own progress in the upper middle class. Too bad, because the
three are funny when they go at one another.
</P>
<P>
   Things go conveniently smoothly with Stella's son, played with a
helpful down-to-earth quality by Michael J. Pagan. But the very
real complications of a matchup between Stella and Winston are
never really approached on a more than superficial level. Bassett
is the big reason ``How Stella Got Her Groove Back'' stays sweet
and warm and nothing but likable, and Diggs makes a highly engaging
debut.
</P>
<P>
   You're always aware that Stella and Winston seem to be reading
their lines from a travel brochure rather than real life. Kevin
Rodney Sullivan, making his own debut behind the camera, seems to
have settled for packaging the film rather than actually directing
it. You couldn't ask for prettier escapism, and Hollywood has never
prized reality. Still, ``How Stella Got Her Groove Back'' does seem
to spend a lot of its time waiting to inhale.

GOLF PILGRIMAGE GOES BEYOND LIFE'S WELL-MANICURED GREENS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN MARSHALL  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The cancer doctors' prognosis for the old man was grim: ``a
month, two at most.''
</P>
<P>
   It hardly seemed the most auspicious time to devote a couple
weeks to a golf pilgrimage, what with all the loose ends to tie up,
the goodbyes to say. But Braxton Dodson, pushing 80, and his son,
James, who was in his early 40s, still set off for the storied
courses of England and Scotland to play those places they had
always promised to do together but had never gotten around to
before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here are my terms,'' the father told his son. ``No complaints.
No long faces. We go to have laughs, hit a few balls, maybe take a
bit of the Queen's currency from each other's pockets. ... I've got
plenty of stuff to do. But I do want to pin your ears back for old
times' sake _ so you'll at least remember me.''
</P>
<P>
   But what happened in the following weeks would be remembered
long after Braxton Dodson's death, not only by James Dodson, but
also by thousands of strangers, all thanks to his remarkable little
memoir, ``Final Rounds: A Father, a Son, the Golf Journey of a
Lifetime'' (Bantam, 257 pages, $12.95).
</P>
<P>
   This is a haunting, bittersweet book that has been becoming a
word-of-mouth classic since its initial publication in 1996.
``Final Rounds'' is about golf, yes, the allure and lore of this
daunting game played across the enhanced landscape. But this memoir
is more about the difficult terrain that must be traversed by all
fathers and sons, that place of longings and expectations and
often-harsher realities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Final Rounds'' does for fathers and sons and golf what ``Field
of Dreams'' did for fathers and sons and baseball, which is no
accident. These two contemplative sports (along with fly-fishing)
have long produced the most compelling literature of any athletic
endeavors.
</P>
<P>
   James Dodson, a former political reporter turned golf writer,
has a deft putter's touch with emotion-laden material that, in less
sure hands, could have been maudlin. Much of his success must be
traced to the resilient character of his father, whom he once
disparaged with a nickname (Opti the Mystic) because of his
boundless optimism.
</P>
<P>
   Braxton Dodson, who had not walked a golf course in years, treks
across the hillocks and dales of courses in Britain, never once
complaining about the ravages of his advancing illness, his
deteriorating eyesight and hearing or the major inconveniences
caused by a radical colostomy a decade before. Opti the Mystic
turns out to be a true Southern gentleman and real trouper, too, an
entirely admirable and wise man in the most trying of
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing life really promises us is pain,'' the father
tells son, at one point. ``It's up to us to create the joy.''
</P>
<P>
   The two Dodsons do play golf on their pilgrimage, with the
spirited mix of competitiveness and kidding that they had brought
to two decades of playing together on their home course in North
Carolina and courses far beyond.
</P>
<P>
   But what their last golf pilgrimage really provides is a chance
to ask questions unasked or share insights unshared while there is
still a little time left, a precious opportunity that probably far
too few fathers and sons ever get to experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Final Rounds'' has prompted all sorts of surprises that James
Dodson never imagined for his first book _ rhapsodic reviews by
critics; sales of more than the 170,000 copies (including 60,000
copies purchased by one golf club in Arizona); a planned film; even
a contract to co-write the memoirs of legend Arnold Palmer (a great
admirer of ``Final Rounds''). Dodson has recently published another
pilgrimage story, ``Faithful Travelers'' (Bantam, 279 pages,
$22.95), about a fly-fishing odyssey with his 7-year-old daughter.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing that occurred in the aftermath of ``Final Rounds''
has affected Dodson quite like what he has heard from more than 30
other men.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have called or written to say that they have taken their
fathers on golf journeys, too,'' Dodson, 45, said this week from
his home in Maine. ``What I really care about, what means the most
to me, is they say that the book touched them so much that these
fathers and sons took a golf trip together like we did.''

   On one wall of the new gallery is a Babylonian lion, one of many
excavated by Germans who didn't have enough room to show them all,
so they sold off parts, including the one the MFA bought in the
1930s. It's made of bricks glazed in gold and turquoise, colors
that still sparkle in spots. The lion's mouth is wide open.
``Egyptian lions have closed mouths,'' Freed observes. ``But this
one is ready to chew.'' There's more chewing in a stone relief from
Persepolis, in which a lion chomps on the flank of a bull. However
gory the subject, the style is lyrical and rhythmic, and the lion
has a cuddly, overgrown pussycat look.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the aid of the map and the well-written wall texts,
most visitors will find the ``where's'' and ``when's'' of this
gallery confusing. (Freed suggests you start by remembering you're
looking at 6,000 years of history in an area 6,000 miles in
circumference.) But the objects themselves are so enchanting
they'll spur you on to learn more. They're arranged in
chronological rather than geographical order, starting with the
object that is possibly the oldest in the entire museum _ a stone
vessel in the shape of a sweet little bunny, which may date from as
early as 6400 BC. Sharing the same case is neolithic pottery from
southwest Turkey, painted with jazzy zigzag patterns that Art Deco
would borrow thousands of years later.
</P>
<P>
   Gold funerary jewelry from northwest coastal Turkey suggests you
can take it with you. The sleek designs _ spirals, twining rope,
animal heads _ may make you want to take these exquisite bracelets
and rings home with you instead. The MFA gift shop, big on selling
replicas, should take note.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most charming of all the objects here is a board game
dating from 2000-1500 BC. It involves pegs and holes, and although
it was popular from Egypt to Iran, contemporary archeologists can
only make educated guesses about its rules _ and about the
consequences for the loser.
</P>
<P>
   Across the room is a tiny amulet, just an inch or so high, which
would have been worn by a pregnant woman to ward off Lamashtu, a
particularly nasty demon in the habit of killing newborns. She's
shown here cackling with glee and carrying off the bribes the
mother-to-be has given her to go away: a comb and safety pin,
trinkets whose modesty suggests Lamashtu should up the ante.
</P>
<P>
   A corridor is lined with cases containing Ancient Near Eastern
coins, helmets, and jewelry including a single earring that was set
with 460 separate specks of semiprecious stones. There's also an
incense burner in the form of a dromedary, from the enigmatic
Nabataean civilization _ which Americans know from the Nabataean
capital, Petra, the red-rock city used as a setting for ``Raiders
of the Lost Ark.''
</P>
<P>
   That corridor leads to the new gallery for Egyptian funerary
arts, where you first encounter a mummification how-to, a case
filled with implements for procedures including pulling out the
brain through a corpse's nose. Turquoise faience canopic jars were
for storing the deceased's organs, although they look like
contemporary kitchen canisters where you'd keep flour and sugar.
There's a mummy tag, used ``so your grandmother didn't get mixed up
with someone else's,'' Freed explains, adding that there's no
record in ancient Egypt of the equivalent of the baby-switching you
hear about in American hospitals. (For those who can't get enough
of mummification, Robert Brier, the first person in 2,000 years to
mummify a cadaver in authentic Egyptian style, speaks at the MFA on
Oct. 29.)
</P>
<P>
   The new gallery's stars are, not surprisingly, the mummies,
along with their gorgeously painted coffins and their fleets of
shawabtis, the little fellows who did the dirty work for you in the
afterlife.
</P>
<P>
   While many of the MFA's Egyptian treasures came to the museum
early in this century, as a result of joint MFA-Harvard excavations
sanctioned by the Egyptian government, this new installation
includes recent loans, gifts, and purchases. Leveraged buyout king
Thomas Lee, cited recently by ARTnews as one of the world's top 200
collectors, has loaned a serenely beautiful mummy mask with
geometric patterns painted on a buttercup-yellow ground, the color
alone hinting at happiness in the Great Beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Freed was particularly pleased with a recent gift from the
Shackford family of Wellesley, who called Freed and said they
didn't want the responsibility of taking care of their papyrus
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``So,'' says Freed, ``I went out to Wellesley for tea and came
back with a fragment from the `Book of the Dead.''' It's a
particularly lovely fragment, with attenuated figures acting out
the Weighing of the Heart, the crucial test to see if you'd been
good enough in this life to qualify for bliss in the next. If you
flunked, you were fed to the crocodile-headed monster Ammit.
</P>
<P>
   For the Egyptians, death was just the beginning. For the MFA,
the Egyptian gallery is just the beginning of the long process of
bringing the old part of the museum into the 21st century. For
Egyptomaniacs, the new gallery is a warm-up for the first major
international loan show on Egypt that the MFA has mounted since
1982. ``Pharaohs of the Sun,'' opening in November 1999, celebrates
the 17-year reign of Akhenaten, who was not only history's first
monotheist, but also husband of Nefertiti _ Egypt's second most
famous glamour girl.

FOUR WAYS TO FIX ERODED CONCRETE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, August 16, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. The concrete deck around my pool is getting badly pitted.
What can I put on it to smooth it out and make it look better? It
is quite an extensive deck, some 500 square feet, so any repair
work would be a lot of work.
</P>
<P>
   J.M., Lynnfield, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. There are several things you can do: Anything you do will be
a lot of work on an extensive deck around the pool. In other words,
there is no easy way, unless you pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   1. Trowel on a layer of Top 'n Bond, a special mortar designed
to go on in thin layers, up to 1/2 inch thick. If you use this
material, be sure to give it a rough, anti-skid surface. To do
this, float it with a wood float 15 minutes or so after laying the
mortar. Floating means rubbing the surface with a wood trowel,
called a float. If you did this with a metal trowel, you will get a
smooth and very slippery surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   2. Apply a bonding agent to the concrete, then cover it with two
inches of standard concrete, then wood float it. This won't work
without the bonding agent, which is a sort of glue designed to hold
the two components together.
</P>
<P>
   3. Have an epoxy covering applied professionally. This might be
slippery.
</P>
<P>
   4. Build a cedar boardwalk over the concrete. This is the
biggest job but may in the long run be the most satisfactory. It
would require installing 1(MUL)4 cedar sleepers on the concrete,
spaced 12 inches apart, then applying cedar floor boards on the
sleepers, spaced enough for drainage, and parallel to the length of
the deck. With luck this will last 15 years. Or, use Trex or other
artificial ``wood'' made of ground-up wood and ground-up plastic
milk cartons. It is more expensive than the cedarbut is likely to
last longer. Neither the cedar nor the artificial wood needs
staining, sealing, or painting, which is an unnecessary maintenance
chore. This wood deck would raise the deck by 1 1/2 to 2 inches or
so, but you might be able to live with that.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I bought peanuts and seed in bulk for the birds and
squirrels, and kept it in the basement. Presto, I am inundated with
mice and rats, and they're not from the Big Dig. I used a
Hav-A-Hart trap without success. The previous owner put insulation
in the basement ceiling, with a plastic cover under it. I can see
the rodents running between the insulation and the plastic. Now
what can I do? I did get rid of the seeds and peanuts. An
exterminator told me that D-Con would take care of the mice, but
not the rats. I'm desperate.
</P>
<P>
   B.T., Brighton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, that's one way to attract rodents. If you see one
mouse, chances are you have 20. There may be fewer rats, but they
need treating even more than the mice. For the mice, D-Con will
work, and it is hoped not too many of them will die in the house.
Some poison baits will work for rats, and the handyman was
successful years ago with a Black Flag bait product to get rid of
his rat or rats. When using D-Con or any other bait, keep it away
from kids, yourself, and pets. You can use snap traps for both, or
sticky traps for mice.
</P>
<P>
   What you have to do, in my opinion, is kill them. Or capture and
kill them. They are not cute and cuddly, eat the US out of house
and home, and carry diseases; even mice can carry diseases. They
are a menace. It's against the law to transport them. Mice are
easier to get rid of than rats.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, take down that plastic under the ceiling
insulation. It is giving the rodents a perfect habitat. With these
runways down, the vermin will have fewer hiding places.
</P>
<P>
   If all this seems a little much, call an exterminator.
</P>
<P>
   A note to the animal rightists: Vermin have no rights.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have a rubber roof on my flat-roofed garage. Can I walk on
it?
</P>
<P>
   C.L., Wellesley, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. No. Well, you can walk on it if you have to in getting from
one place to another, but you cannot use it as a patio or deck,
with furniture and other paraphernalia of a deck. There is no
membrane for a roof that can be walked on and stay waterproof.
</P>
<P>
   What you can do, however, is build a deck of pressure-treated
floor boards, spaced 3/8 inch for drainage, on top of sleepers,
which keep the deck boards (like a regular deck) up off the roof a
few inches.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am moving into a brand new house. Should I seal and
waterproof the concrete floor in the basement and garage?
</P>
<P>
   RALPH ZACCHEO, Salem, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. In the basement, why bother? It will do no good except to
make the floor a little more easily cleaned. It will also need
resealing once a year or so; well, perhaps a little longer between
sealings because the floor is protected from the weather, but that
resealing is an unnecessary maintenance chore.
</P>
<P>
   The garage is another matter. It will not hurt to seal it,
making it easier to clean and also making it resistant to oils and
grease and other automotive contaminents.
</P>
<P>

HEADY DAYS FOR AN OLD SOCK-DRAWER STAPLE

 By FRANCIE LATOUR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It's about as basic and black as you can get, and right
now, it's wrapped like a gauze skin around Sandler Lacoste's
low-cut, caramel-colored head.
</P>
<P>
   This is not _ he repeats, not _ your grandmother's do-rag.
</P>
<P>
   ``People always wore it for the waves,'' said Lacoste, a
Lexington High School freshman who plopped onto a park bench and
considered how a single piece of nylon cloth has evolved from a
hidden headpiece to an essential urban uniform.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like me, I cut this from a stocking, to keep my waves in
check. But now, these other kids are wearin' them just to wear
them. 'Cause they wanna be with their boys. They wanna be hard. ...
Who knows why they do it?''
</P>
<P>
   At 15, Lacoste knows where do-rags have been, and he knows where
they're going.
</P>
<P>
   He's not happy about it.
</P>
<P>
   They always served a function _ to cover rollers at night, keep
curls in place, and enhance the natural wave buried in thick black
locks. But the do-rag, that cut-up piece of worn stocking that came
from the deep recesses of a forgotten sock drawer, has become a
fashion statement on the street corners of many neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the headgear has spawned sleeker, skullcap models of
itself, in brand names like Nike and Tommy Hilfiger. They come with
strings in the back and without. They come in different colors,
naturally, to match with different outfits.
</P>
<P>
   It's gotten to the point where youths like Lacoste and his
friends are being forced to revert to the old style before it
became a new style _ stealing hose from a sister's drawer and
smoothing it over their heads _ just to maintain their dignity
against the slaves to street fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people started wearing it outside for function, and
everyone else started following it just to do it,'' said Jonathan
Rogers, 14, whose do-rag stretched from his head like a ratty
Christmas stocking. ``Then they started making them in blue, red,
white, you name it. It's all over the place.''
</P>
<P>
   For David Kong, owner of Mattapan Discount Hair &AMP; Beauty,
granny's old rag has turned into a $200-a-week moneymaker. In a
beauty shop where almost all women shoppers wade through huge bins
of hair accessories and endless aisles of shampoo, men dominate the
do-rag business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost every guy who comes in here buys at least one or two
packs of them,'' said Kong. ``Older guys, younger guys. It's just
the style. That's what happens when one famous person starts
wearing it that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Conrad Phillip remembers when it was just a woman thing. He also
remembers when men started wearing it at night, or just before they
were getting ready to go out. But he has no idea why something so
functional at its core has turned into fashion on a brand-name
scale. All he knows is, it works.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only good reason to wear something like that tied around
your head in public is to keep your hair neat,'' said Phillip, 23.
``I need it.''

<P>
   When the Japanese automakers took aim at the American luxury-car
market, they followed the dictum of an American general who had
advised ``Hit 'em where they ain't'' as sound strategy. And where
the Americans were absent in the luxury car battle was in the
fields of quality control and customer service.
</P>
<P>
   The pattern was repeated by Honda (Acura), Toyota (Lexus) and
Nissan (Infiniti). Don't just make a luxury Honda/Toyota/Nissan;
create a whole new luxury division, open separate showrooms and
dedicate the sales and service forces to customer satisfaction.
And, by the way, sell at a ridiculously low price while offering
ridiculously extravagant service so as to capture market share _
the Japanese understand market share.
</P>
<P>
   Dealers had to commit to new showrooms, lots of money and
training programs. But, dealers make a living on a complex
assortment of business _ used-car sales, service and repair,
aftermarket stuff _ not just new-car sales. In fact, for many, the
cutthroat competition for new-car business can thin gross profit
margins to a losing proposition. What to do?
</P>
<P>
   The answer for all three, it seems, was to become ``full-line''
divisions offering not just the top-drawer luxury boats _ the
Legend, Lexus and Q45 models _ but adding entry-level and
mid-priced luxury cars, sporty luxury cars ... you see the
oxymorons here? Entry-level luxury? Just what is that?
</P>
<P>
   A very real problem with this approach is that the low rungs
added to the luxury ladder tend to compete with the upper rungs of
the mother division _ Infiniti's G20, for example, is up against
Nissan's Maxima. It's cannibalism, creating another model line to
devour sales of the original line. The early G20 was pretty much a
well-dressed Sentra, something akin to what Cadillac Cimmarron was
to Chevy Cavalier.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the pitfalls, the Japanese made it work. Nissan has its
problems, but Nissan/Infiniti is still a major presence in the
American market. And the G20 is still around, too _ which brings us
to the point of all this.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not certain that the G20 is the answer to anybody's luxury
fantasies, but it is a vastly improved automobile over its earlier
incarnations, stylish, well-appointed, comfortable with a real back
seat. The performance is a wee bit anemic _ it is sadly eclipsed in
that department by its Nissan cousin, Maxima, which falls in the
same price range.
</P>
<P>
   The G20 for 1999 comes with a 140-horsepower, 16-valve,
2.0-liter I-4 engine coupled with a 5-speed, manual gearbox, and a
cloth interior for $20,995 nicely equipped. A fancier touring
model, the G20t, is $22,495 with manual shift _ all prices plus
$495 delivery. A four-speed automatic adds $800 to either model; a
leather package that includes a moonroof is $1,700 on the base,
$1,200 more on the G20t. Alone the moonroof is a $950 extra; heated
seats at $420 complete the option list.
</P>
<P>
   The new G20 may be ``entry level,'' but as an Infiniti it is no
bottom feeder. It at least looks like an Infiniti on the outside,
with a grille that proclaims its claim on the family name and nice
lines. You might even say it's elegant for a small car.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, there is no doubt about heritage, no mistake about the
luxury intent. The tested G20t was finished in leather, trimmed
with expensive veneer, abounding in small bits of elegance. But
what really made it for me was the rear _ it has room for adults
and underway does not induce mal de mer. That alone is a
significant improvement over the original effort.
</P>
<P>
   That original G20 of memory was a tight fit _ small door to
squeeze through, no kneeroom, not a lot of headroom, either. And
the suspension was tough, with the ride characteristic of a
buckboard or a Morgan _ stiff _ and a ``busy-ness'' that induced
nausea.
</P>
<P>
   So I made it a point to ride in the back of the new G20t that
Nissan insisted was ``much improved,'' albeit with a solid axle and
multilink rear suspension rather than the independent arrangement
used on other Nissan models. Maybe old stuff rides better than new
technology sometimes. For once, a car company was right to say
``much improved.'' The new G20 is a pleasant vehicle on a bad road
even after a big lunch, and there is decent legroom even with the
front seats pushed all the way rearward on the track.
</P>
<P>
   But much improved doesn't mean it's leapfrogged the competition
_ or even caught up. The G20t optioned approaches the other guys'
entry level models in appointments.
</P>
<P>
   Up front, gauges are clear, controls fairly well laid out _
although the radio does not have the knobs this columnist favors,
at least the buttons and bars were reasonably big. And it is a Bose
system with CD player and tape deck. Window switches and mirror
controls were handy.
</P>
<P>
   A small covered bin conceals removable cupholders; small glove
box, door bins, and seat pockets offer some interior storage. The
car comes with a fair-sized trunk, but the opening is a bit small
if you're contemplating bulky stuff. In addition to front air bags,
the G20 also comes with side air bags for a bit more protection and
4-wheel antilock brakes. So far, so good.
</P>
<P>
   The tested car came with a smooth, five-speed, manual transaxle,
but the engine is disappointingly tame, even with the stick.
Acceleration is OK, but don't bother trying to pass in fifth gear.
Think twice before attempting it in fourth. No, shift down to third
as you squeeze the pedal to the floor and demand everything it can
give _ which will be enough but not really impressive. The G20t
comes with a spoiler, an accouterment of performance, usually _ in
this case it might be considered false advertising.
</P>
<P>
   The handling is more than competent. This is no sports car, but
it corners well, grips the curves, proved nimble in traffic and
steady in evasive maneuvers. Fuel mileage was pretty good; the G20t
delivered 25.67 miles per gallon in varied driving over 675 miles
charted.
</P>
<P>
   Infiniti blathers on in the ads about European heritage, and one
supposes some people will buy into that, and a lot of them will
never know the difference. This is not a premier luxury/performance
sedan. The G20t is a taste of luxury, not the whole meal. It offers
an Infiniti badge at Nissan prices, comfort, room, style, good
handling and ride, and a bit more than adequate performance _
budget luxury.
</P>
<P>
   I give the G20t a thumbs up ... mostly. Understand that in the
G20 line Infiniti is promising a bit more than it really delivers _
and if you insist on getting that Euro-pizazz you thought was
promised, they'll offer you an I30.

`AIR BUD' SEQUEL SHY OF A GOLDEN ACHIEVER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT POWERS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
AIR BUD: GOLDEN RECEIVER 
Directed by: Richard Martin 
Screenplay by: Paul Tamasy and Aaron Mendelsohn 
Starring: Kevin Zegers, Gregory Harrison, Cynthia Stevenson, Nora
Dunn, Perry Anzilotti, and Robert Costanzo 
Running time: 91 minutes 
Rated: G 
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The ``Beethoven''/``Bad News Bears'' formula that helped concoct
last year's successful family film ``Air Bud'' is tinkered with
only slightly in ``Air Bud: Golden Receiver,'' the second in what
the producers promise will be a series of
sport-playing-dog-saves-the-day movies.
</P>
<P>
   Buddy is now a two-sport player, adding football to his
basketball skills. The golden retriever still has a knack for
helping fatherless Josh (Kevin Zegers) find his way through junior
high school life and he's again pursued by evil-doers, two Russian
circus animal wranglers who replace the first movie's sleazy clown.
This time around, Buddy adds a touch of matchmaking to his athletic
abilities.
</P>
<P>
   When Josh takes Buddy to the vet for a checkup, Patrick Sullivan
(Gregory Harrison) makes instant friends with the needle-shy dog
and it's clear that their shared love of yogurt will lead to
romance between Sullivan and Josh's widowed mom Jackie (Cynthia
Stevenson). And almost as fast as you can say 101 Dalmatians, Buddy
pulls a rollerblading Jackie down the boat dock where Patrick is
tending his boat and into his arms.
</P>
<P>
   As the romance grows, Josh grows anguished about his loyalty to
his late father and his mother's new happiness. He decides it's
best to be away from the house more often, and so he goes out for
the football team. Just as in the first movie, Josh is practicing
when he discovers Buddy has a talent: this time instead of shooting
baskets, it's playing wide receiver. Josh becomes the hapless
team's backup quarterback, only to get called into the first game
when the starter goes down for the season with a shoulder injury.
After a disastrous first play, Josh goes back to pass again, fires
deep and, of course, Buddy appears to catch the ball and run to the
end zone.
</P>
<P>
   With Buddy now the team's offensive and defensive star (just
like the pros, his tackles low and goes for the ball), the
Fernfield Junior High team is on its way to the Washington state
finals. But there are hurdles for both the team and the blooming
romance between Jackie and Patrick. Josh, suspicious of Patrick,
finds photos of him with other women. Then, just before the big
game, the Russian circus duo finally capture Buddy to star in their
show.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian duo is homage to Boris and Natasha from the Rocky
and Bullwinkle cartoons, with Nora Dunn's Natalya sounding like
Natasha on helium. Natalya and Popov (Perry Anzilotti), other than
providing plot advancement, are there just for John Hughes' ``Home
Alone''-like physical comedy, and really don't provide the same
tension that the first movie's clown created.
</P>
<P>
   ``Air Bud: Golden Receiver'' suffers a bit when compared to the
first ``Air Bud.'' While Zegers is wholesomely appealing as Josh
and Harrison is fine as the love interest/emerging father figure,
this story lacks an engaging character like the Bill
Russell-lookalike electrician/coach from the first movie. But
despite its more predictable storyline, ``Air Bud: Golden
Receiver'' will appeal to those looking for that too-rare family
movie. At one advance screening, kids 5 and up seemed more able to
sit through it than those younger. For those with younger kids,
consider waiting for what we'd propose as the third installment,
when Buddy learns baseball: ``Air Bud: Golden Reliever.''

SARATOGA REPORTING STELLAR YEAR AT THE RACES 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ New York Racing Association officials
are raving over the first two weeks of the 36-day thoroughbred
racing meet at Saratoga Race Course.
</P>
<P>
   Daily attendance for this meet, which started July 29, has
surpassed attendance figures for each of the first 14 days of last
year's meet. Officials can't remember that happening in previous
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been doing very good because we started the meet later
this year and we've had great weather,'' said Terry Meyocks, the
Racing Association's president and chief operating officer. ``I'm
happy with how things are going as long as everyone that comes into
the track is happy.''
</P>
<P>
   The average attendance through the first 14 days was 25,650, an
increase of 22.5 percent from last year's 20,941 for the same
period.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like to think it can continue but, at the same time,
the fat lady hasn't sang yet,'' Meyocks said. ``We are concerned
about Labor Day (Sept. 7) because it's so late, but we're willing
to take our chances.''
</P>
<P>
   William Nader, director of broadcast communications and
promotions, said the Racing Association is hoping to end this
season with an average daily attendance of more than 23,000. The
highest average attendance in the history of the meet is 28,479 per
day. That figure was set in 1989, when the meet was only 24 days.
</P>
<P>
   The average handle also has increased. On-track handle averages
for the first 14 days was $2,989,569, compared to $2,455,356. That
is a 21.8 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get more people coming to the races, you're going to get
more people betting,'' Nader said.

BRUCE HORNSBY GETS BACK TO BASICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Elemental. It's not a word always associated with Bruce Hornsby,
whose sometimes ornate, classical-jazz influenced piano style has
earned him sessions with Ornette Coleman and Wayne Shorter. But
Hornsby can also cut back to a funkier, stripped-down approach, as
he does with the post-Grateful Dead band the Other Ones and on an
upcoming double CD, ``Spirit Trail,'' which sports his most
accessible music in years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more elemental groove-wise,'' Hornsby says of the new
double CD, which comes out Oct. 19. ``It's not as harmonically
complex. It's easy for me to write a lot of weird chords, but I
wanted to do something more elemental this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new record is more of an R&AMP;B, gospel, and bluesy record,''
he says. ``It's a more Southern record. It was just what I was
drawn to at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Hornsby will preview a bunch of the new songs this Sunday night
at the South Shore Music Circus in Cohasset, Mass. He's also added
a guitarist (Doug Derryberry from the D.C. area) for the first time
in years. ``He adds a lot of texture,'' says Hornsby. ``He plays
electric 12-string and Rickenbacker and acoustic 12-string. Some of
the new songs have mostly guitar. Again, it was just time for a
change.'' (The guitarist on the record is John Leventhal, known for
his work with Shawn Colvin.)
</P>
<P>
   The new album also has the most Dead-like music that Hornsby has
done as a solo act. He even samples Jerry Garcia's ``China Cat
Sunflower'' on a new tune called ``Sunflower Cat.'' The Dead
connection makes sense, because Hornsby wrote some of the songs
while on tour with the Furthur Festival last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hatched, gradually, on the bus,'' he says. ``There are
grooves and loops and beats. I was on the bus writing on a Casio
(keyboard).''
</P>
<P>
   Among the new, Southern-based songs, says Hornsby (who lives in
Virginia), are ``Sneaking Up on Boo Radley'' and ``Preacher in the
Ring, Part I and II,'' which is about a ``snake-handling
congregation in Appalachia.'' The song describes a ``man in a
reptilian suit with a rattling sound.'' The concept stems from the
Book of Mark in the Bible, which has a line that ``they will handle
serpents.'' Says Hornsby: ``Some people took it seriously and based
a religion around it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hornsby's touring band also has a new drummer, Michael Baker,
who replaces longtime accompanist John Molo (who worked with the
Other Ones this summer). Baker has played with Joe Zawinul, Wayne
Shorter, and Branford Marsalis, but only has done a couple of gigs
with Hornsby, partly because his wife recently gave birth to a baby
and he has needed to stay home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Grateful Dead used to be the band that never rehearsed,
but now my band is not rehearsed,'' Hornsby notes with a chuckle.
``But I'm not going to be the (guy) who says to him come on and
rehearse when his wife is having a baby. But he's a very good
drummer. It's OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Hornsby had played with Molo for 21 years, but both agreed to
take a break for a while. And Hornsby still praises Molo, calling
him one of the keys to the success of this summer's Other Ones.
``Molo helped a lot,'' Hornsby says. ``The band had more power with
Molo in it. The Dead were lighter.''
</P>
<P>
   The Other Ones, which included Dead alumni Bob Weir, Mickey
Hart, and Phil Lesh, exceeded many fans' predictions this summer
and far exceeded Hornsby's. ``Everything came together and we had
so much fun,'' he says. ``I hope we do it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Hornsby is now sifting through nine CDs of concert recordings
from this summer in order to help fashion a live CD by the Other
Ones, to be released next year. ``We'll work on it in San Francisco
this September,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   First, though, is Cohasset this Sunday.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Crit picks: The Music Critics Organization, a national body of
journalists who listen to records for a living, has listed its
Top10 albums of the year so far. In order: Lucinda Williams, ``Car
Wheels on a Gravel Road''; Garbage, ``Version 2.0''; Billy Bragg &AMP;
Wilco, ``Mermaid Lounge''; Jeff Buckley, ``Sketches''; Tori Amos,
``From the Choirgirl Hotel''; Joe Ely, ``Twistin' in the Wind'';
Pulp, ``This Is Hardcore''; Ani DiFranco, ``Little Plastic
Castle''; Madonna, ``Ray of Light''; and Dave Alvin, ``Blackjack
David.''

</P>
<P>
   Getting gritty: Ever heard of Grits? I hadn't, either, until I
caught them recently at the Plough &AMP; Stars in Cambridge, Mass..
Grits' music is a tasty mix of tension-and-release harmonics,
melody lines that surge like those of Dire Straits, and a singer
named Pluto, who has that undefinable quality known as charisma.
They have an excellent rhythm section in Mark Eaton (bass) and
Brian Montgomery (drums); and a dobro player, Tim Kelley, who
crosses Appalachia with psychedelia. This is an original act for
people who still believe in such things.

KORN FEEDS THE PEOPLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We have witnessed the Clinton campaign, the Dole campaign, and
the Dukakis campaign. Now comes the Korn campaign _ a populist rock
'n' roll assault led by the ear-splitting, heavy-metal 'n' rap band
Korn, which aims to bypass normal media outlets and create a direct
pipeline to its fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Korn campaign is going to be insane,'' says Korn singer
Jonathan Davis. ``We got a private jet and we'll do a spoof on
campaigning and stuff. And we'll have press conferences and take
questions from fans. We're just bringing our music to the kids.
We'll hang out with them and find out their concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   Korn _ the screamingly intense, no-holds-barred California band
that sings about dysfunctional families and general societal
outcasts _ has a new album, ``Follow the Leader,'' which is another
part of the campaign. It's a totally in-your-face, often
outstanding, follow-up to their multiplatinum, Grammy-nominated,
and viciously ironic ``Life Is Peachy'' disc.
</P>
<P>
   Korn's men-of-the-people marketing scheme includes a series of
in-store appearances around the nation. These events are a prelude
to the band's ``Family Values'' tour, which includes fellow misfits
Limp Bizkit, Ice Cube, and Orgy (the first band on Korn's new
record label, Elementree). (Rob Zombie was also on the bill, but
dropped out after a dispute between the managers of the two groups.
``Our band has nothing against Rob, but his manager was being a
(jerk). He was trying to have creative control of our tour,'' says
Davis.)
</P>
<P>
   As for the tour:
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have a revolving stage and do songs with Limp Bizkit and
Ice Cube,'' says Davis, whose group used these acts on album tracks
that assault your ears with out-on-the-fringe irreverence. One new
track is ``All in the Family,'' a rapping battle royale between
Davis and Fred Durst of Limp Bizkit. Durst gets in his shots
(``halitosis is the only thing you're rocking steady,'' he says to
Davis), but Davis nails him in return. ``You look like one of those
dancers in the Hanson video,'' Davis raps. And this is just the
printable stuff. There are many other exchanges that, shall we say,
hit below the belt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just me and him ragging on each other,'' says Davis,
laughing. ``Some kids think that Korn and Limp Bizkit hate each
other. But hey, why we would be in the same room talking to each
other if we hated each other? We have total respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Originally, the song was for B Real of Cypress Hill,'' adds
Davis. ``But his record label wouldn't let him do it. I'm glad,
because this came out way better.''
</P>
<P>
   Outlaw rapper Ice Cube was brought in for ``Children of the
Korn,'' a new tune that may be the heaviest song that Korn has ever
recorded _ and that's saying something, given the band's reputation
for sledgehammer riffs mixed with techno sound effects and
over-the-top shrieks and death-rattle moans from Davis. Cube's
contribution is also blistering. He angrily raps that ``we're not
taking no more guff,'' followed by some four-letter words that
would stop Tipper Gore in her tracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ice Cube came in and listened to the song, then wrote his
lyrics. He's so professional that it's insane. He did his thing in
two takes,'' says Davis. ``And he was totally into it. He started
screaming and really going off. He said, `I want some of this
(stuff) on my record.' He was so happy. And that guy is like an
idol to us, from the days he was with N.W.A. He's the one hip-hop
artist we all like. We tend to like different kinds of hip-hop, but
we all have Ice Cube's albums.'' (Korn returned the favor by
backing up Ice Cube on the song ``Should I Stay or Should I Go''
for the upcoming Clash tribute album, and by playing on three songs
for Ice Cube's next solo disc.)
</P>
<P>
   The new ``Follow the Leader'' is Korn's third album _ and a
pivotal one, in Davis's eyes. ``The third album is really
crucial,'' he says. ``We're over the sophomore jinx. But I think
that the third album is more important than the second one. If it's
good, you're set for the next 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   It's good, make no mistake about that, but it's not for the
squeamish. There's one song, ``Pretty,'' about a 12-month-old girl
raped and killed by her father. It's a true story, based on Davis's
former experience as a coroner in Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an image that has haunted me ever since I saw it,'' says
Davis. ``There are a lot of memories that haunt me from that place,
but this one more than anything. And I always wanted to write a
song about it. I tried back on the first Korn album, but it didn't
work out. I just couldn't put it into words.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis and his band mates _ Fieldy on bass, James ``Munky''
Shaffer on guitar, Brian ``Head'' Welch on guitar, and the simply
named David on drums _ aren't totally obsessed with the dark side
of life, however. Another new song, ``Seed,'' talks about Davis's
2-year-old son, Nathan, and yearns for the innocence of that age.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take him to Disneyland and see his face light up. I want to
have that feeling again of being a kid,'' he says. ``I want to be
innocent again. I don't want to be a stressed-out (adult).''
</P>
<P>
   Davis lavishes attention on Nathan and even plays Korn's music
for him, which might horrify some parents. ``My little baby listens
to the stuff every day. He screams and has fun. It's awesome,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   Davis endured a rough childhood with a stepmother he blasted on
earlier Korn albums. ``We don't even say her name anymore,'' he
notes today, adding that his father has since remarried. ``The No.1
thing that screwed me up in life was her. But everything is cool in
my family now,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Korn has succeeded despite meager help from MTV, which is often
reluctant to play a ``heavy rock band,'' says Davis. But that may
change with the band's new single, ``Got the Life,'' a fast-paced
guitar tune that has been lighting up modern-rock radio stations
and may force MTV's hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``MTV is now begging us for a video,'' Davis says. ``So we're
doing a video. What the heck, all it can do is help us. It can't
hurt us. We'll give it to them and see what happens. We'll see if
they finally give us some love.''

COMPAQ EXECUTIVE SUITE HAS A DIGITAL LOOK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOANN MULLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the old days at Digital Equipment Corp., executives who fell
out of favor with the computer maker's legendary founder, Kenneth
Olsen, were banished to a small, nondescript office insiders dubbed
``the penalty box.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Olsen hadn't fired them _ they were typically assigned
to ``special projects'' _ most understood their careers at Digital
were over.
</P>
<P>
   ``You sat there until you got bored and quit,'' observed &UR;  &LR; Terry
Shannon of Ashland, an independent consultant and longtime Digital
watcher who writes a newsletter about the company. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A few of those who were banished stuck it out at Digital _
outlasting Olsen, who was forced out in 1992 _ while
others &UR;  &LR; eventually ended up at Compaq Computer Corp., the
fast-growing, Houston-based PC company that acquired Digital two
months ago. &UR;  &LR; Now a handful of these refugees &UR;  &LR; find themselves
sharing Compaq's executive suite with other Digital alumni who were
picked for Compaq's top management after the merger.
</P>
<P>
   Call them survivors. Whether it's because of the merger or the
vagaries of corporate politics, there's a sizable Digital alumni
club running Compaq, the world's No. 2 computer maker. Their common
bond is that they all made the move &UR;  &LR; from a fallen computer giant
to a &UR;  &LR; rising technology star. Their climb at Compaq underscores the
fact that in the fast-changing world of technology, perhaps more
than in any other industry, reincarnation is always possible. &UR;  &LR;   &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  ``You can sin from time to time and still come out a winner,
as long as you have the proper attributes,'' said Shannon. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Half of the 12 executives that Compaq chief executive Eckhard
Pfeiffer named to his senior management team after the merger are
Digital veterans _ a fact that Pfeiffer insists will help smooth
the transition as the companies are melded into one.
</P>
<P>
   Three of his new deputies _ John Rando, William Strecker and
Thomas Siekman _ are longtime Digital managers who took the direct
route to Compaq, joining when the deal was completed. (They were
the only members of the senior team of Robert B. Palmer, Olsen's
successor, &UR;  &LR;  who were retained by Compaq.)
</P>
<P>
   Three others _ John Rose, Enrico Pesatori and Earl Mason _ left
Digital in the 1990s after clashing with Olsen or Palmer &UR;  &LR; over the
company's direction. But their career paths, full of twists and
turns, also brought them to Compaq's top ranks, where, ironically,
they now have a bigger say in what was once the Digital empire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call it Rose's revenge,'' quipped one longtime Digital
employee.
</P>
<P>
   Rose, who left Digital in 1992 after clashing with Olsen over
Digital's PC strategy, is now a senior vice president at Compaq in
charge of the enterprise computing group, which includes much of
the former Digital operations.
</P>
<P>
   Pesatori, 57, an Italian-born industry veteran who joined
Digital in 1993 and ran the company's computer systems division,
also has found career redemption at Compaq. Many people viewed him
as Digital's &UR;  &LR; second-in-command and the likely candidate to succeed
Palmer. But in July 1996, Pesatori quit abruptly amid signs that he
was being blamed for the company's flagging personal computer
sales.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't unemployed for long. Four months later, he became
president of Tandem Computers Inc., ending up at Compaq after the
Houston-based PC company bought Tandem in 1997. Pesatori is now
Compaq's senior vice president of marketing, responsible for the
company's marketing, branding, and advertising strategies.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime manager Strecker, a talented engineer who was
instrumental in the development of some of Digital's most
influential computer systems, nonetheless spent his share of time
in Olsen's penalty box, according to many current and former
Digital employees. Olsen reportedly blamed Strecker for misreading
several important market trends, which caused Digital, for
instance, to stick too long with its proprietary VMS operating
system instead of shifting to the more broadly accepted Unix
operating system.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Strecker was skewered in a 1997 article in Upside
magazine, which claimed that he and Palmer were ``the ultimate
architects of Digital's failure.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Strecker, widely regarded as a technological genius, is
clearly a survivor, too. He's now Compaq's chief technical officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy's got more lives than a cat and more endurance than
the Energizer bunny,'' said Shannon.
</P>
<P>
   The reunion of these former Digital comrades inside Compaq's
executive suite has rekindled memories of the glory days, when
Digital was the king of the minicomputer era and operated from a
converted woolen mill in Maynard.
</P>
<P>
   ``John Rose and I bunked in the same tent together at Ken
Olsen's campground up in northern Maine,'' recalled Rando, head of
Compaq's services division. Olsen frequently brought Digital
managers up to his rustic campground on the Canadian border for
in-depth strategy sessions known as ``woods meetings.''
</P>
<P>
   Miles from the nearest highway, managers had no choice but to
bond with their fellow Digital executives in those primitive
surroundings, Rando said.
</P>
<P>
   The closeness that developed during those team-building
exercises at Digital, he said, has resulted in a level of
familiarity and trust within Compaq's new management team that is
rare in the wake of a merger.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``Our working relationships are well-established,'' Rando
said. ``We know how each other thinks. That kind of mentorship and
supportive interactions of the management team are hard to come by.
They're real assets.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, power struggles among rival executives can often doom a
merger.
</P>
<P>
   ``These mergers are usually disasters,'' said Edgar Schein,
professor emeritus at the MIT Sloan School of Management. ``If this
one is not a disaster, that might be the reason.''
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone thinks the preponderance of former Digital
executives within Compaq's top ranks is a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It troubles me that so many Digital managers are in a position
of authority at Compaq,'' said writer Geoffrey James, who penned
the 1997 Upside article and is also author of a new book called
``Success Secrets from Silicon Valley'' (Times Books, May 1998).
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest danger that Compaq has is it will take on
Digital's culture, instead of the other way around,'' James said in
an interview, alluding to Digital's historically consensus-driven,
slow-moving, bureaucratic culture. ``If that happens,'' said James,
``the company will go right down the toilet, just like Digital did.
... On the other hand, if Compaq energizes what's left of Digital,
then something good could come out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The former Digital executives now running Compaq admit there are
differences in the ways the companies have been run, but said the
cultural differences are overblown.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you graphed it, Digital would probably have had more ideas
and initiatives bubble up from the bottom, while Compaq would have
more of a top-down direction,'' said Siekman, who was Digital's
chief counsel before the merger and now holds the same position at
Compaq.
</P>
<P>
   Because Digital under Olsen emphasized the concept of ``buy-in''
or consensus-building, it often took a long time for decisions to
be made, said Rose.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Compaq, there's an orientation to finding the data, getting
the data visible, and making decisions very quickly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Rose, Siekman and the others agreed that the culture that
existed at Digital in the 1970s and '80s was much different in the
1990s, after competition increased and Digital endured a painful
series of restructurings and layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ken had unique ideas about how a company should be managed,''
Strecker said. ``I think the environment under Bob Palmer was not
the same. There was a bit more top-down orientation under Bob.''
</P>
<P>
   Rando insists that neither company's past culture matters, nor
does the culture that existed at Tandem before it was acquired by
Compaq.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to build a new culture,'' he said. ``You don't
bring three companies together and believe that any one is going to
dominate.''

CAN WE TALK _ ON RADIO? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL BLOWEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Can we talk?
</P>
<P>
   It's mid-afternoon and the plumber has just arrived at Joan
Rivers's apartment in Manhattan. It seems that her toilet is
undergoing a renovation and she's not taking it well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm having a rotten day,'' she says. ``How can it be a good
day when the plumber shows up? Just say Rivers is a bitch. I'd like
to say I'm having a PMS day but that would make me too young.''
Then she laughs.
</P>
<P>
   While some know Rivers as the ``E!'' correspondent who covered
this year's Oscars, or as the host of a syndicated radio show,
others remember her as the queen of comedy _ a feminist trailblazer
in a field long dominated by men. She started in the late '50s,
before there were comedy clubs. In 1965, the Barnard College Phi
Beta Kappa graduate got a shot on ``The Tonight Show'' with Johnny
Carson and became a huge hit. She became a substitute host for the
vacationing Carson and, as the '60s ended, she was headlining in
Las Vegas _ the hottest female comic in America.
</P>
<P>
   Through the '70s and into the '80s, Rivers continued her upward
spiral, substituting for Carson for one week every month. In 1986,
she made a career move that, at the time, seemed perfect. She
agreed to host her own late night talk show on the burgeoning Fox
network with her husband, Edgar Rosenberg, producing. It was a
horrible error. Carson trounced her in the ratings, and some say he
used his considerable clout to keep guests from appearing on her
show. Rivers's show bombed. And, a year later, Rosenberg committed
suicide. Rivers was devastated.
</P>
<P>
   For a long time she couldn't really talk about it. But she
pulled herself together and, in 1989, she re-energized her career
with an Emmy-winning daytime talk show that ran for several years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't miss that show,'' says Rivers, 65, as her Yorkshire
Terrier, Spike, barks in the background. ``TV talk changed too
much. I'm just not interested in some cousin who sleeps with his
brother's wife or people with mall haircuts who live in trailer
parks. Get a life. Get busy.''
</P>
<P>
   Rivers has returned to talk but this time, she's on the radio
with a two-hour call-in talk show.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get to say exactly what you want to say,'' she says. ``And
you don't have to get dressed up. And I can shave my legs while I
work _ with a weedwhacker.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, there's a loud flush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have the only toilet in New York that everyone will hear
every time I use it,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Rivers says she enjoys teaming up with Don Rickles for these
weekend summer stock-type engagements.
</P>
<P>
   ``The family and crew all pile into the van with the barking
dogs and everything else,'' she says. ``And we stop at
McDonald's.''
</P>
<P>
   Do the workers ask for your autograph?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yea, I sign about 37 from the manager on down and they don't
give me as much as a French fry,'' she says. ``And they won't let
the dog in the restaurant.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Joan and Melissa Rivers starred in ``Tears and
Laughter: The Joan and Melissa Rivers Story'' a TV movie that
focused on, among other things, Rosenberg's suicide.
</P>
<P>
   ``The male critics all hated that movie and the female critics
loved it,'' she says. ``The first day we shot Edgar's funeral it
took a long time to set up the shot. We were in a car and Melissa
said to me, `if Daddy were producing this movie, we'd be done by
now.'''
</P>
<P>
   The dog's barking in the background. And Joan Rivers, whose
career spans five decades, is waiting for the plumber to finish.
Sometimes even she gets tired of talking.

`SLOW MOTION' VIEW OF A LIFE UNTETHERED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
SLOW MOTION 
A True Story 
By Dani Shapiro 
Random House, 245 pp., $23.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Slow Motion'' is a candid memoir of a misspent life
resurrected from the ruins of a devastating tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   At 23, Dani Shapiro was drifting toward oblivion. Once a
promising student of music and literature at Sarah Lawrence
College, she dropped out of school to pursue acting, but that was
little more than a half-hearted attempt at respectability. Her true
career was being the mistress of Lenny Klein, a powerful New York
lawyer who also happened to be the stepfather of her best friend.
Klein made Shapiro a kept woman, and while she hated his swaggering
ways, she loved the money and power which kept her in fancy
apartments, well-stocked limousines, and five-star European hotels.
</P>
<P>
   She changed her surname from Shapiro to York to conceal her
ethnic and religious heritage. To drown out the white noise of her
life, Shapiro packed her nose with cocaine, and drank vodka
splashed over ice, chased with wine. It had become a life
untethered and unrecognizable.
</P>
<P>
   Then she receives a telephone call which, Shapiro recalls,
``divides my life into before and after.'' She was three days into
her stay at a ritzy Southern California health spa, no doubt paid
for by her sugar daddy Klein, when her aunt informs her that her
parents have been critically injured in a car accident. Her mother
sustained more than 80 broken bones, and her father would be left
with the mentality of a confused child.
</P>
<P>
   A blizzard back east prevented Shapiro's immediate return to her
New Jersey hometown, but Klein manages to get her on the first
available flight. Once she boards, she anesthetizes herself with
alcohol, but it is not enough to numb her greatest fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since I've been old enough to comtemplate loss, I have
imagined losing my father. Whenever we have been together and said
goodbye I have wondered if that goodbye would be the last,''
Shapiro writes. ``Though he is a bear of a man, an imposing figure
really, I have seen him as physically fragile, vulnerable,
picturing a fatal heart attack, an embolism, a stroke _ my father
falling like an old heavy tree to the pavement on Wall Street where
he works, or while walking to temple on a Shabbos morning.''
</P>
<P>
   For Shapiro, returning home means not only dealing with the
current crisis, but with the life she abandoned. For her first 17
years, she was raised in an Orthodox Jewish home where her father
wore a yarmulke, the Sabbath was observed, and her family adhered
to religious dietary laws. Even among other Jewish families in
Hillside, N.J., her family stood apart, separate from others who
``sent their daughters for nose jobs and their sons to golf camp.''
</P>
<P>
   Stepping back into her parents' home churns up a plethora of
painful memories from the lonely years of an only child who always
felt somewhat estranged from her parents. There, she also finds the
girl who became the woman who only saw value and currency in her
blond good looks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have used myself as a physical instrument, slicing my way
through the world with nothing but youth, long legs, and long blond
hair,'' Shapiro writes. ``At times I think I have chosen the easy
way, but every once in a while I realize that this may be the
hardest way of all.''
</P>
<P>
   From the ashes of her family's hardship, Shapiro begins to
restore and reshape herself. Dealing with her parents' daily
medical crises, she finds the structure and rhythm her life has
long lacked. Whereas once it revolved around Klein and job
auditions, she finds she at last has ``a purpose, a reason to wake
up in the morning. I am needed.''
</P>
<P>
   An accomplished novelist _ her last book, ``Picturing the
Wreck,'' also dealt with a family tragedy _ Shapiro uses the tools
of fiction to tell her story. Unfortunately, that technique robs
the book of some of its emotional power. And since the story is
told in the present tense, it loses the weary wisdom of
retrospection.
</P>
<P>
   But Shapiro does not sugarcoat her life; she writes with an
eviscerating, raw honesty about the wrong turns and mistakes she
made. She is equally harsh with her family, capturing the
jealousies and pettiness they refuse to put aside in a time of
calamity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Slow Motion'' has an upbeat ending, but it is an arduous trip
to that conclusion. Along the way, Shapiro will battle her
addictions, and confront the full horror of her relationship with
Klein. One of her parents will die, and she will deal with
long-simmering tensions with the one who remains. Yet Shapiro
emerges sadder but wiser, the one true survivor of that horrific
accident on a snowy night in New Jersey.

THIS IS NO TIME TO BE TOO HEAVILY INVESTED IN STOCKS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, August 16, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am 64 years old and my wife and I are retired. We own our
home, have no debts, and have fixed expenses of $16,000 a year.
Income from Social Security and a pension is $36,000 a year. I have
a total of $306,000 in IRA accounts of which $256,000 is in stock
mutual funds and $50,000 in a zero-coupon bond maturing in the year
2000. In addition, my wife has various investments totaling
$100,000 in mutual funds, savings bonds, and bank savings. Since I
have no plans to withdraw any of the investments before the
mandatory age of 72, when should I plan to reinvest into a more
conservative portfolio, and what should the portfolio consist of?
</P>
<P>
   D.E., Bristol, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, there's no time like the present. Even though you can
afford to take a long-term view of the market, it seems to me that
holding more than 84 percent of your portfolio in stock funds at
this point is far too aggressive. I find no fault with your fund
choices _ the largest holding is $58,000 in the excellent Legg
Mason Value Trust, followed by holdings of $25,000 in Fidelity
Growth and Income, and $24,000 in Vanguard Index 500. But I
calculate that more than 75 percent of the fund portfolio is
dominated by large-cap stocks _ the very market segment that has
dominated the strong market gains of recent years and which is now
stumbling.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you decide to stick with such a stock-dominated
portfolio, I suggest you seek more diversification. For example,
you have $18,000 each in Vanguard Growth and Income and Vanguard
Windsor II, both of which have large-cap, value-oriented
portfolios. My suggestion would be to swap one of these positions
for something such as Vanguard Small-Cap Index. You might also look
for a good mid-cap fund (such as Homestead Value or Mutual Beacon)
and a good health-care fund, (such as the sector offerings of both
Fidelity and Vanguard).
</P>
<P>
   But more important than diversifying within the various sectors
of the stock market is diversifying beyond stocks. I suggest that
about 25 percent of the current stock fund portfolio be moved to
the fixed-income side, building a bond portfolio consisting of
about 50 percent in a GNMA fund, and 25 percent each in a
short-term bond and a high-yield (or junk) bond fund. You might
also further cut your reliance on stock funds by moving some of the
large-cap holdings into a balanced fund such as Fidelity Puritan or
Vanguard Balanced Index.
</P>
<P>
   One final thing: you're a little optimistic about when you'll
need to begin taking mandatory distributions from your IRA accounts
_ the rules require that the first distribution come by April 1 of
the year following the year when you reach age 70 1/2, so even if
your birthday falls in the second half of the year, your first
distribution would precede your 72nd birthday by a few months.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I will be 67 years old next January, and I am beginning to
taper off working as a temporary employee. I have already started
drawing Social Security, but have to return most of it because of
my earnings. My monthly benefit from Social Security is now $1,287.
From the following portfolio, where should I begin drawing funds to
bring my monthly income up to $3,000? I have $193,800 in IRAs,
$69,700 in common stocks, $29,500 in money markets and CDs, and a
variable insurance policy with a $12,700 cash value.
</P>
<P>
   R.P., San Marcos, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. In the best of all possible worlds, what you would be looking
for is at least a 6.72 percent return from the total portfolio,
which would allow you to make the monthly withdrawals of $1,713
with no loss of principal. If you judge by the stock markets of the
past few years, that would seem like falling off a log. But I have
long been trying to persuade people that the last few years have
been atypical for Wall Street, and that when you have a sequence of
unusually strong years there, it's most likely that what will
follow is a sequence of so-so, weak, or horrible years. So to me a
6.72 percent portfolio average seems to me a bit more dubious, at
least in the short term.
</P>
<P>
   A good deal of the IRA portfolio is well chosen for income _
Cohen and Steers Realty fund, Equity Residential Property Trust (a
NYSE REIT), Janus Flexible Income fund, and Lindner Dividend fund
all sport solid yields. Dodge and Cox Balanced, at 3.1 percent,
also has a respectable yield for the current market. But the
dividends are minimal for Hotchkiss and Wiley International,
Neuberger and Berman Guardian, and Vanguard Index 500, the last of
which is your largest single holding.
</P>
<P>
   My suggestion would be to reduce your positions in those final
three funds from the current total of $77,600 to about $40,000,
diverting the proceeds to a pure fixed-income fund such as Janus
Flexible Income or Vanguard GNMA. I would tentatively suggest
similar moves within the common stock portfolio, which is dominated
by telephone issues, providing that there would be no horrible tax
consequences. Finally, you include a $9,000 money market account
with a credit union and a $7,000 money market account that is
associated with a brokerage account. Check on the yields from these
accounts _ my strong hunch is that you could probably get better
money market yields from a money market mutual fund.
</P>
<P>
   Where should you draw the money once you have tapered off from
working? If you expect to have some earned income during 1999, it
would make sense to draw from the taxable accounts, calculating
that in subsequent years your taxable income will be lower, and
thus you will be better off waiting to withdraw from the IRA until
you have little or no earned income. Thus I would begin by taking
income from the stock dividends, the yields realized if you convert
some of the common stock to fixed-income holdings, and finally from
the money markets and CDs. Once your earned income has trickled
down to an insignificant level, you might then begin withdrawing
the actual yields from the IRA accounts, and then taking whatever
else you need from whatever holding seems weakest or most
tax-efficient to sell.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. We would like to start our 14-year-old grandson in investing
his money _ birthday gifts and Christmas gifts and so forth. Should
he do a CD or some mutual funds? What is the best place for his
small amount of savings? We have investments with Fidelity. What
type of investment might our 19-year-old daughter make?
</P>
<P>
   P.H., Lynn, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The answer to the question depends on another question _ when
are your grandson and granddaughter likely to use the money? If
he's likely to go on to a secondary education in about three years,
there's no question that CDs would be far better than most mutual
funds; even funds at the more cautious end of the spectrum, bond
funds and the like, can be quite volatile over a three-year time
frame, even though their longer-term records seem quite stable.
</P>
<P>
   But let's presume that both your grandson and granddaughter
won't be using the money right away, perhaps letting it grow until
they are in their late 20s and are thinking about making their
first home purchase. In that case a mutual fund would be a good
choice. With such a time frame, I'd suggest an investment such as
Fidelity's Puritan fund, which holds about 63 percent of its assets
in stocks and the rest in bonds and other fixed-income securities.
It's been one of Fidelity's stronger funds in recent years
(relative to its objective) and has a good record of weathering
sour markets fairly well.
</P>
<P>
   The only potential bug is the Puritan requires a minimum initial
investment of $2,500, even for a uniform gift to minor's account.
They do allow a $1,000 minimum for custodial accounts in Fidelity
Asset Manager, which is roughly similar, but which hasn't done as
well historically as Puritan. There are a number of no-load
balanced funds with lower minimum investments _ AARP Balanced Stock
and Bond, and Pacific Horizon Asset Allocation at $500, and Pax
World and Strong Asset Allocation at $250. But of the funds I have
listed, all but Fidelity Puritan are given average ratings by
Morningstar Mutual Funds. Puritan is rated above-average. So a
solid strategy, if the minimum deposit is an issue, might be to
begin with CDs and then move into a mutual fund once the account
reaches the required level.

   Music, art and drama can pay huge intellectual dividends in
terms of a child's mental development, Blumenthal writes. Studies
have shown, for example, that students who study music do better on
their SATs and score higher on spatial IQ tests. Blumenthal offers
tips on how parents can boost their children's learning powers
through exposure to the arts. (slugged:

   Parents of children with late-summer or fall birthdays often
find themselves faced with a difficult decision _ whether to let
the child be one of the youngest in the kindergarten class, or wait
until the following year. Bulion tells the stories of three
families confronted with this dilemma and how they reached their
decisions. (slugged:

   Math, reading and geography lessons can delight rather than

Software Revue. She gives a rundown of some of the best educational
programs and reference software on the market, programs that are so
much fun that kids won't even realize how much they're learning.

   More and more businesses are adopting policies that recognize
the problems parents have balancing work and family. But now these
family-friendly policies are igniting a backlash from childless
employees who feel resentful about what they perceive as more
favorable treatment of working parents. Harris looks at the
validity of these objections and suggests ways that employers can
treat both groups equitably. (slugged:

   High-fat diets and sedentary lifestyles are leading an
increasing number of children to tip the scales at far beyond their
ideal weight. Hours of playing videogames or watching television
instead of partaking in more physical activities are taking their
toll, Downey says. So is the decline of the family dinner hour.
Downey offers advice to parents on how to help children take off
those extra pounds. (slugged:

<P>
   Janice Ruell started worrying about when to send her third
child, Rosemary, to kindergarten even before the baby was born.
</P>
<P>
   Her first and second children had both arrived several weeks
later than expected, so when she went into labor in late August,
only a couple of days after her due date, Janice sat up on the
delivery table and shouted, ``She made the cutoff!''
</P>
<P>
   Five years later Rosemary's late-summer birthday did, in fact,
mean that she could begin kindergarten just as she turned 5, making
her one of the youngest kids in the class.
</P>
<P>
   Janice's older children had spring birthdays, and she couldn't
help but focus on the developmental differences between Rosemary
and her other children.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first two kids seemed further along in their intellectual
development when kindergarten came up,'' Janice recalls.
``Rosemary's sister wanted to go to kindergarten so badly that we
had to mark off each week on a calendar from her April birthday to
the first day of school, the following September. I was expecting
to see that same burning desire from Rosemary, but I've noticed
that she often has trouble thinking about the unknown.''
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult for most parents to determine with absolute
certainty their children's readiness for kindergarten. Kids
approaching their fifth birthday can take large developmental
strides and acquire a good deal of self-confidence between spring
registration time and the first day of school at the end of the
summer. And the fact that parents get so much advice on the issue
can sometimes make the decision even more overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   The conventional wisdom is contradictory at best: ``It helps to
be the oldest in the class,'' ``You can get ahead if you start
younger,'' ``Keep young boys out a year,'' ``Children should be
able to tie their shoes, write their names and count up to 10.''
</P>
<P>
   How is a concerned parent to sort out the most important factors
in making the decision?
</P>
<P>
   The three kids described below had parents who reached different
conclusions about the timing of early schooling. Though the
decisions differed, they each led to a successful kindergarten
experience.
 &UR; ROSEMARY'S STORY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rosemary's parents ultimately decided to send her to
kindergarten despite the fact that she was likely to be one of the
youngest kids in the class. Her father, Steve, didn't doubt
Rosemary's readiness for one second.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was so enthusiastic about learning,'' he says. ``I thought
we should take advantage of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosemary's mother eventually agreed and was happy about the
decision, which was also influenced by friends' experiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost embarrassing,'' Janice admits, ``but there's a
certain social pressure on parents as well as children. Rosemary's
neighborhood friend has the same birthday, and her mother never
considered keeping her out of kindergarten for a year. Rosemary
would have been upset if her friend went to kindergarten and she
didn't. And I felt that Rosemary was as ready as her friend was.''
</P>
<P>
   Janice also talked to Rosemary's teachers at Chelmsford
Children's School, a private day-care and preschool program in
Chelmsford, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all felt Rosemary was ready for kindergarten,'' says Dianne
Sadowski, Rosemary's preschool teacher. ``She had no difficulty
separating from her mother and father and showed a fair amount of
self-confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   The teachers in Rosemary's preschool reassured her mother that
such social skills as communicating thoughts, listening, following
instructions, sharing and making transitions from one activity to
another are more important than mastery of the alphabet in helping
children to absorb what kindergarten has to offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rosemary started out the school year on the quiet side,'' her
Harrington Elementary School kindergarten teacher, Dora Bungard,
says. ``She was absorbing things, but she wasn't ready to volunteer
and share her knowledge. Then she went through this magical
transition that often happens in late winter, and now she is really
a class leader.''
</P>
<P>
   As a child learns classroom routines and develops a trusting
relationship with the teacher, she demonstrates increasing
confidence in her ability to master tasks in kindergarten. At the
same time, a child's large and small motor skills, attention span
and listening skills continue to develop.
</P>
<P>
   In Rosemary's case, the ``magical transition'' included an
increase in self-confidence and progress in her ability to handle
pencil and paper and perform other small motor tasks.
 &UR; NICHOLAS' STORY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Is separation anxiety a reason to wait? Camille Lema, a mother
of two from Durham, Conn., opted to wait a year before sending her
son, Nicholas, who has a late-December birthday, to kindergarten.
Nicholas' parents made the decision mostly because he'd insisted
that his mother stay with him for a large part of the day during
his entire first year of preschool.
</P>
<P>
   ``Academically, he knew a lot, and he played well with others,
but he just didn't appear ready to move on,'' Camille says.
</P>
<P>
   The ability to separate confidently from parents is something
that develops over time at a child's own pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children who have the hardest time in kindergarten are the
ones with big separation anxiety,'' says Diane Kischell, director
of the Wesleyan University day-care and preschool in Middletown,
Conn. ``If they worry all day long, then they are not going to be
connected with the school process.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas' difficulties with separation indicated that the
demands of kindergarten, the school bus and a new setting would be
more than he could handle. At the end of his first preschool year,
he was still challenged by the experience.
</P>
<P>
   His parents' hunch that he wasn't ready for kindergarten was
shared by his preschool teacher, Kathy Meyering.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nicholas underwent a metamorphosis during his second year of
preschool,'' she recalls. ``He began to jump into the day and he
became very comfortable with his classmates, at times even taking a
leadership role in dramatic play.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas developed the ability to separate from his parents in
his own time. The way they supported him gave him the security and
confidence he needed to successfully negotiate kindergarten at
Brewster Elementary School a year later, at 5 years, 9 months. When
the first day of school finally rolled around, Nicholas was excited
to start.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's such a kind, sensitive boy,'' says Ann Rau, Nicholas'
kindergarten teacher. ``He came to our class with some strong
preacademic skills, but he never outgrew kindergarten by being a
little older.''
 &UR; ERIC'S STORY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With a mid-October birthday, Eric Wenz narrowly missed the Ohio
kindergarten cutoff date of Sept. 30. In the Kenston school
district, where the Wenz family lives, parents of children born
between Oct. 1 and Dec. 31 can apply for early kindergarten
entrance. Admission is based on a written application, a visit to
the child's preschool by elementary-school staff, an interview and
a series of standardized tests.
</P>
<P>
   While most potential kindergartners are not required to go
through such an extensive entrance process, many school districts,
like Eric's, hold regular kindergarten screenings in early spring,
at which parents and children meet kindergarten teachers, speech
and language specialists, school nurses and other school personnel
who can help sort out various questions about readiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eric showed some abilities that seemed far beyond his age, and
yet he's still a little boy,'' Eric's mother, Margie, says. ``His
emotional maturity was the biggest unknown for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The evaluation process for early admission was lengthy but
helpful, Margie says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eric took it all in stride,'' she recalls. ``We could see him
becoming more and more confident, and by the time of his testing, I
knew he was ready. Now we have to get used to the idea of our last
child going off to school!''
 &UR; THE BOTTOM LINE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When to send a child to kindergarten can seem a momentous
decision to parents, who hope their child will feel secure,
confident and open to the learning experience. While many parents
may worry, the fact is that most healthy, age-eligible children
will thrive in a good kindergarten setting.
</P>
<P>
   ``A child who has been talked to, who has been questioned and
who has been given answers to questions, a child who has been read
to and who has learned to share and play with other children and to
take turns is more successful right from the beginning,'' says
Carol Aikenhead, past president of the Kindergarten Association of
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Five-year-old Rosemary knows the feeling of success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like kindergarten, and I learn a lot of stuff,'' she says
enthusiastically. ``All of my new friends are here, and my teacher
smiles. When it is a kindergarten day, I feel happy.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   When Mark Schubart was dean of New York's famed Juilliard School
of Music, he was visited in his office one day by a distraught
mother pulling along her little boy.
</P>
<P>
   What could she do about him? she asked. Here the boy was,
already 4 years old, and his piano repertoire consisted of only 34
pieces!
</P>
<P>
   Schubart, now chairman of the Lincoln Center Institute, which
trains teachers to use the arts to expand young minds, still shakes
his head over the encounter. Clearly, some people don't know when
to stop pushing their kids.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, however, parents with a more measured
appreciation of how to boost their children's learning power are
tuning in to a host of exciting new findings. Music, in particular,
is emerging as both a pathway and a stimulant to intellectual
growth.
</P>
<P>
   But the visual and dramatic arts can play a big role too, along
with other approaches that are revolutionizing childhood education.
On television, that master teacher ``Sesame Street'' has been
applying some of the latest research in maximizing youngsters'
capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Watch carefully and you'll see how lessons on the same topics
are increasingly being clustered for reinforcement. The letter of
the day _ D _ might be shown in different ways: outlined in
candles, and then set to music in clay animation. Preschoolers who
have trouble grasping the lesson in a linguistic way may get it
through music or movement or other presentations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea,'' said Celia Genishi, chairwoman of curriculum and
development at Columbia University's Teachers College, ``is to give
children many different entry points for learning.''
</P>
<P>
   Driving all this is a new understanding of intelligence.
Increasingly, experts are redefining intelligence as more than
linguistic and mathematical ability, the traditional yardsticks.
Rather, they say, it takes many forms.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to specialists such as Howard Gardner, a professor of
education at Harvard who is widely credited with the theory of
multiple intelligences, and Daniel Goleman, author of the
best-selling book ``Emotional Intelligence'' (Bantam Books,
$19.95), our understanding of the workings and expression of
intelligence has widened.
</P>
<P>
   Now we include creative powers and the ability to understand
oneself and others along with the rest of the natural and spiritual
world, as well as the simple ability to get along with other
people.
 &UR; SEVEN KINDS OF INTELLIGENCE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gardner makes a case for at least seven different intelligences:
linguistic (poet), logical-mathematical (scientist), musical
(composer), spatial (architect), bodily-kinesthetic (dancer,
athlete), interpersonal (salesman, teacher) and intrapersonal
(those with a highly developed sense of self).
</P>
<P>
   The implications of this expanded view of intelligence have been
sweeping. No longer must the label ``smart'' be reserved for the
best readers, writers and counters in the classroom. Now youngsters
who can follow complex dance steps or drum rhythms, organize games
or soothe conflicts with their schoolmates can be recognized as
possessing different types of intelligence. And these skills can be
utilized to learn the ever-crucial reading, writing and arithmetic.
</P>
<P>
   Although scientists are still struggling to understand the
developing brain, there is widespread agreement that the preschool
years open a mental window through which learning can flood in at a
rate never again duplicated in life. Opportunities not exploited at
this time can never be made up.
</P>
<P>
   Within the first four years of life, the child's brain grows to
fully two-thirds of its adult size, evolving at a faster rate than
it ever will again. And the stimulation present at that time will
have a lot to say about the kind of adult the child will become.
 &UR; WHAT PARENTS CAN DO &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In one famous 1960s experiment, scientists at the University of
California at Berkeley raised two groups of lab animals, one in a
setting of wheels and ladders and toys, the other in an
impoverished environment. After several months the animals in the
enriched setting not only were in better health and performed
better, but also had grown larger brains.
</P>
<P>
   So what can parents do to boost their children's learning power?
</P>
<P>
   + Expose them early to music and art.
</P>
<P>
   This should be done not in hopes of uncovering a prodigy, though
that may possibly happen, but because research has found links
between intellectual achievement and musical training and ability.
</P>
<P>
   How early? Well, some mothers-to-be make a point of listening to
Mozart and other soothing symphonists. Their hope is to predispose
their offspring to high culture, although science has yet to
confirm that this works.
</P>
<P>
   Because financially hard-pressed schools around the country have
cut arts programs left and right, parents have to do more to take
up the slack. Music lessons in piano or violin, two of the most
popular instruments for children to learn, can be started as early
as preschool.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some experts say it's almost never too soon to begin
and, for those with true talent, starting too late may mean never
fully exploiting their gifts. The idea is to train children so
early that their technique becomes intuitional.
</P>
<P>
   + Take children to live performances.
</P>
<P>
   There's no better way of exciting them about the arts. Give them
a good view of the conductor. Let them peer into the orchestra,
before or after the performance. Go backstage afterward if
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Many young people's teaters make a practice of letting the
actors in costume mingle with the audience after the curtain. Allow
time after the show for your kids to shake hands with the stars.
Or, for a look behind the scenes of a show or concert, try to
attend a dress rehearsal.
</P>
<P>
   + Do dance exercises with young children at home.
</P>
<P>
   The urge to dance and move to rhythm is strong in many children.
Isadora Duncan liked to say she learned to dance in her mother's
womb.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from formal ballet and dance instruction, parents can put
on some music and have children dance or skip to the changing
rhythms. Ask them to imitate sailboats or gliding seagulls. Teach
beats with a makeshift drum.
</P>
<P>
   + At museums, look for ``please touch me'' exhibits.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing teaches children faster than hands-on experiences.
Children's museums are particularly rich in such fun, educational
displays.
</P>
<P>
   Many museums also offer children's art programs. Instructors
lead young visitors to a sculpture or painting gallery, talk a
little about the work on display and then give out paint, paper and
crayons with which the children try their own versions.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, parents can do similar things at home using art
books, art supplies and collage materials they have at hand _
anything from cut-up magazines and newspapers to old photos, pieces
of fabric and buttons.
</P>
<P>
   + Buy your child an inexpensive camera.

   Oldr children are often intrigued by photography. The pictures
they take can be developed inexpensively at neighborhood film
depots and used by parents as a springboard into discussions about
color and design: What makes some pictures nicer than others? How
does an artist pick a subject and angle?
</P>
<P>
   + Expose children to other languages at an early age.
</P>
<P>
   With their young brains programmed to soak up information at a
rate they will never achieve again, preschoolers can painlessly lay
the foundations for multilingualism. A foreign language that they
experience now will never sound completely strange to them again
and will be picked up much more quickly in later years.
</P>
<P>
   Research increasingly supports these recommendations. In one
recent study, four classes of first- and second-graders in West
Orange, N.J., were taught music using a highly structured and
demanding program pioneered 60 years ago by the Hungarian composer
Zoltan Kodaly. Their art instruction was also particularly
challenging. Four other classes took conventional music and art.
</P>
<P>
   After two years, the enriched classes had doubled the percentage
of pupils performing at grade level in math, to more than
three-quarters of the class. The other classes had lower gains.
</P>
<P>
   The benefits seem to endure. In profiles of test-takers, the
College Board found that those who studied or played music scored
an average of 51 points higher on the verbal portion of the SAT and
39 points higher on the math portion.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, at the University of California at Irvine,
psychologist Frances Rauscher and neuroscientist Gordon Shaw found
that preschoolers who took keyboard lessons for eight months
boosted their IQ scores on spatial tests by 46 percent.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Rauscher and Shaw reported, college students
who listened to a Mozart sonata for 10 minutes performed better on
spatial IQ tests _ a benefit termed ``the Mozart effect.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Music excites the inherent brain patterns and enhances their
use in complex reasoning tasks,'' the researchers concluded.
</P>
<P>
   The visual arts, too, pay intellectual dividends. Philip
Yenawine of Development Through Art, former director of education
for the Museum of Modern Art, reported that students who learned to
critically discuss paintings in a museum did better in social
studies and other subjects. They learned to formulate theorems,
draw meaning from abstract ideas and communicate thoughts. And
their writing improved.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, nothing can turn off youngsters faster than forced
marches down endless museum corridors. One clever way of focusing
children's attention is to buy them postcards of works of art and
then challenge them to find the originals on the walls.
</P>
<P>
   Ask open-ended questions such as: What's happening in this
picture? What do you see in it?
</P>
<P>
   Don't look for any special answer _ just signs of thinking.

   Once seniors overcome any anxiety they might have about
computers, they find a host of intriguing Web sites to suit their
needs and interests. Ann Orr, a software reviewer for Children's
Software Revue, highlights some of the best sites that are geared
to or likely to appeal to seniors. (slugged:

   It's late at night and you suddenly feel chest pains. Do you
call an ambulance or figure that it can wait until the morning?
Lenane offers tips on how to determine whether various ailments _
skipped heartbeat, chest pain, cramps, night sweats, dizziness _
are likely to be serious enough for a 3 a.m. run to the emergency

   As people age, they tend to suffer memory loss. Glicksman
discusses the three types of memory _ long-term, intermediate and
short-term _ and how each is affected by the aging process. She
also offers strategies on how to keep one's memory sharp. ``Much
like muscles that grow flabby if not exercised, your memory
requires daily toning,'' she writes. (slugged:

   ``Organization is important in everyone's life, but for the
elderly it can be the key to how well they can function
independently _ and for how long,'' writes Feldman, a professional
organizing consultant. Discussing how she assisted her own mother,
she gives practical advice on reorganizing kitchens, shelves,
personal papers, shopping lists and jewelry boxes to make life

   Millions of senior citizens and their offspring wrestle with the
difficult and often heartrending problem of where the elderly
should live when they can no longer cope alone at home. These days
nursing homes or moving in with the children are not the only
options. Daniel looks at some of the alternatives he and his wife

 &HT;    Transform your child's study sessions _ with the help of a
computer, CD-ROMs and the Internet.
 &HT;    The latest techno-tools can captivate reluctant students, bring
ordinary text to three-dimensional life and condense a bookshelf's
worth of reference guides into a single disk.
 &HT;    Is your son struggling with square roots? There's new and
exciting software _ see Algebra Smart _ that takes the drudgery out
of drill and practice and can be programmed to focus on square
roots, fractions or whatever else makes up this week's lesson plan.
 &HT;    Your daughter's studying Africa? With the click of a mouse _ see
Microsoft Encarta Virtual Globe _ she can hear the music of Rwanda,
see a sweeping 360-degree panoramic map, even access a Website that
details the war between the Tutsi and Hutu peoples.
 &HT;    Below are recommendations on the best and most interesting study
aids and reference tools _ each of which has been approved by a
panel of parent and child testers. You'll need a CD-ROM drive for
all of the programs mentioned, and an Internet connection to visit
the Websites.
 READING AND LANGUAGE ARTS  
 &HT;    Reading Blaster: Ages 6-9. For reading-skills practice, you
can't go wrong with this space-age game show that teaches
comprehension, vocabulary, spelling and phonics through seven
different reading games and three printable storybooks. In Word
Zapper, youngsters dodge falling meteors as they scramble to build
words based on phonics sounds and spelling rules. In Get-a-Clue,
children read for meaning as they use their deductive reasoning to
solve mysteries. More than 2,000 words are presented, and the
program features nine levels of difficulty.
 &HT;    Runs on Windows/Mac. Knowledge Adventure, $30, ages 6 to 9.
 &HT;    Major League Reading. Sports fans can improve their reading
comprehension, spelling and vocabulary skills when they play this
simulated baseball game. Kids control the plays by reading
curriculum-based articles and answering questions that test their
comprehension.
 &HT;    Runs on Windows/Mac. Sanctuary Woods, $29.95, ages 8 to 12.
 &HT;    Claris Works for Kids. While older kids can handle the adult
version of Claris Works, elementary-age children will enjoy hearing
their stories read aloud, learning about fractions by making their
own pie charts and creating multimedia book reports and
presentations with sounds and movie clips.
 &HT;    Runs on Windows/Mac. Claris Corp., $49, ages 5-11.
 MATH  
 &HT;    Algebra Smart. This entertaining game makes studying algebra fun
_ no kidding! More than a hundred video lessons and 500 practice
problems make up the core of the program, but the zip comes from
the software's zany humor. In The Algebra Games, kids compete
against a team of math nerds, complete with thick specs and pocket
protectors.
 &HT;    Runs on Windows/Mac. The Princeton Review, $30, ages 14 and up.
 &HT;    Treasure MathStorm! In an arcadelike format, children sharpen
their math and problem-solving skills. Their task is to climb a
snowy mountain _ capturing elves, answering math problems and
testing their knowledge of time and money along the way. The
software automatically adjusts in difficulty, or grown-ups can set
specific levels. Our testers couldn't get enough of this one!
 &HT;    Runs on Windows/Mac. Learning Company, $29.95, ages 5 to 9.
 &HT;    Geometry Blaster. Kids outsmart the evil Geometrons by
completing activities dealing with perimeter, area and volume,
proofs and theorems, ratios and proportion _ a full year's worth of
curriculum. Tutorials, extensive record-keeping and three levels of
difficulty make this an excellent choice. A ninth-grade math
teacher who tested this program liked it so much he promptly
ordered one himself.
 &HT;    Runs on Windows/Mac. Knowledge Adventure, $35, ages 12 and up.
 &HT;    Mighty Math Calculating Crew. Third-to-sixth-grade math is the
focus of this excellent program. Superheroes such as Wanda Wavelet
use on-screen objects to teach addition, subtraction,
multiplication, estimation and geometry. There's a Superhero
Superstore where kids practice money skills and a 3D lab where they
classify two- and three-dimensional figures. The program tracks
each child's progress and automatically adjusts in difficulty.

fun. Children are challenged with the task of repairing a computer
infected with pesky bugs and viruses. Kids turn to maps and other
visual aids to answer geography questions and save the day. The
software features more than 600 questions and more than 1,400 maps,
charts and photos.
 &HT;    Runs on Windows/Mac. Houghton Mifflin, $59.94, 8 to 12.
 &HT;    Microsoft Encarta Virtual Globe 1998 Edition. A must-have for
any home software library, this version features 19 map styles, 1.2
million place names and 500 new geography articles. Kids can ride
along on spectacular 3-D fly-throughs over the Andes or the Grand
Canyon and zoom in on street-level maps of 50 world cities. Three
thousand color images and 4,000 sound and music clips add to the
memorable experience. This excellent reference tool is so slick and
entertaining parents and kids will return to it often.
 &HT;    Runs on Windows 95. Microsoft, $54.95, ages 10 and up.
 MULTI-SUBJECT  
 &HT;    Grolier's CornerStone Home. Here's an impressive set of
programs, perfect for concentrating on just those math and
language-arts skills that give a youngster the most trouble. This
12-volume series is grouped by subject and grade level. For

 By CHARLES DOWNEY  
 From Kiwanis magazine 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Jimmy, a 6-year-old first-grader, should have weighed about 50
pounds but pressed the scales to the 95-pound mark. At his school
near Baton Rouge, La., the lumbering lad always was dead last in
gym-class activities and any sports he played with fellow students.
 &HT;    Because of the flabby rolls that hung over his pants, Jimmy
suffered all the cruel taunts other children could heap on a boy
who weighed almost twice the normal weight.
 &HT;    Eventually, his physician referred him to a weight-loss clinic,
the Committed to Kids Pediatric Weight Management Program at
Louisiana State University in New Orleans.
 &HT;    One of his first prescription slips read: ``Play outside twice a
week for 20 minutes.'' This could entail walking, bicycling,
in-line skating or other common childhood pastimes. At first, it
was difficult for him to huff and puff through those 20 minutes,
but he slowly improved.
 &HT;    Like Jimmy, most obese children live in industrialized nations,
but cases of childhood obesity are found worldwide. American kids
top the childhood heavyweight list: One in four children ages 5 to
12 is 70 percent or more over his or her proper weight, according
to the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta.
 &HT;    Childhood obesity is partly caused by children being home alone
after school and snacking on whatever they want, as often as they
want. Also, more and more children have become couch potatoes who
routinely log four to six hours a day watching television or
playing video games.
 &HT;    Medical doctors, nutritionists and child-behavior specialists
are concerned about these trends, because obese children still are
growing and require certain nutrients for healthy physical and
mental development. Such growth may be stunted by high-fat diets
and sedentary lifestyles.
 &HT;    After a year at a weight-loss clinic, Jimmy worked up to doing
aerobic exercises and other physical activities for 45 minutes five
times a week. He _ along with his family _ also learned
much-improved nutritional habits and reduced his weight to 67
pounds.
 &HT;    But the big plus for Jimmy was constantly finishing first in
physical activities and sports at school. The cruel taunts stopped
when he began placing at the top.
 &HT;    Trading television for sports works, and many children need to
try it. The World Health Organization once surveyed Canadian
children and found that, outside school, the girls were active only
half an hour per week or less. One-fourth of the boys and girls
reported spending at least four hours a day in front of the tube.
 &HT;    ``We don't tell our young patients they must give up
television,'' says Uwe Blecker, medical director of the LSA
weight-loss clinic, ``but instead of watching television or playing
video games four hours a day, we ask them to reduce it to three. Or
we ask them to ride a stationary bike or walk on a treadmill while
watching television.''
 &HT;    It's all too easy for children to get their forks into one of
the biggest health hazards: fatty foods. Health professionals who
monitor the eating habits of young children have found that one
cheeseburger with fries can equal the total amount of fat a child
should consume in two days.
 &HT;    Children who must watch their weight are encouraged to consume
more whole grains, vegetables and fruits while cutting back on _
not eliminating _ dairy products, beef, pork, lamb and high-fat or
highly sugared treats.
 &HT;    Obesity has a genetic link. According to Canada's National
Institute of Nutrition in Ottawa, Ontario, if both parents tip the
scales at a normal weight, the probability of a child becoming
obese is about 10 percent. But if one parent is overweight, the
child's odds of matching that physical trait rise to 49 percent.
 &HT;    If both the mother and father are overweight, a child stands an
80 percent chance of becoming obese, due to a complex mix of
genetic and lifestyle factors that medical scientists don't fully
understand.
 &HT;    What medical science does understand about obesity is the
increased risk of more widespread health woes, such as the
development of diabetes, hypertension, atherosclerosis or skeletal
problems in hips and legs.
 &HT;    Studies reveal that portly children usually grow into pudgy
teens and adults. Each stage then brings its own woes. For
instance, University surveys and personality inventories show that,
as early as kindergarten, children have an aversion to obesity and
describe their overweight classmates as less likable, less capable
and less able to control themselves.
 &HT;    To curb childhood obesity, the American Pediatric Association
urges families to begin early with proper diets and exercise. When
overweight children learn to reduce and maintain weight through
good nutrition and exercise, the loss is more likely to be
permanent as they grow into young adulthood.
 &HT;    ``One of the primary causes of childhood obesity among our
patients is because families no longer sit down together for dinner
at a fixed time,'' says Baylor College's William Klish. ``Instead,
children eat in front of the television, after `grazing' all
afternoon. But when everybody in a family sits down for dinner at a
fixed time every night, fewer and healthier calories are consumed.
Also, today's children just don't play outside like they did in
years past.''
 &HT;    Families eat less when they eat together, because they talk and
that slows down the speed of eating, giving the stomach's fullness
signals a chance to work. Even small amounts of food will begin
sending satiety signals to the brain after about 20 minutes.
 &HT;    Children tend to lose weight more successfully when the entire
family is involved. Ideal loss for plump children is no more than
one-half to one pound per week.
 &HT;    ``When an overweight child starts watching the types of food he
or she eats, the rest of the family also must watch what they
eat,'' says Marilyn Day, a nutritionist at Children's Hospital in
Denver, Colo. ``It's unfair to forbid cookies and other treats to a
child while others in the home munch them.
 &HT;    ``I've found in my practice that a child often can lose unwanted
pounds through some very simple changes in ordinary foods that are
normally kept in the home,'' she adds. ``I've known children who
cut back from whole milk to skim milk or cut out the highly sugared
cola drinks and lost weight.''
 &HT;    Other researchers have uncovered an unexpected source of flab in
a study group of 168 children ages 2 to 5: fruit juice. In
Pediatrics, the journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics, they
reported that children who drink at least 12 ounces of fruit juice
a day are more likely to be obese.
 &HT;    Young children worldwide are famous for being fussy eaters. More
than one serving of peas or spinach has ended up on the floor or
caused an evening-long power struggle between parents and children.
Studies have disclosed, however, that if caretakers introduce new
or more nutritious foods to young children too forcefully, it can
backfire.
 &HT;    Susan Johnson, an assistant professor of pediatrics at the
Center for Human Nutrition of the University of Colorado Health
Sciences Center in Denver, found in a study of 77 youngsters ages 3
to 5 that those children with the most body fat also had the most
controlling mothers.
 &HT;    Johnson notes that, though parents still are responsible for
making sure that children eat healthful food, the ``children
themselves are capable of figuring out how much to eat.''
 &HT;    Her advice about clean plates? ``Relax a little.''
 &HT;    The study revealed that children whose mothers allowed them to
be spontaneous about food _ to eat when they are hungry and not
necessarily finish all the food given to them _ showed a natural
instinct for regulating their own calories.
 &HT;    So there may be hope for caregivers trying to make vegetables _
and other unfamiliar but healthful food _ more popular with young
children. After all, if it leads to better health via an
appropriate weight, what harm is there in a few servings of peas
and spinach on the dining-room floor?

 By DIANE HARRIS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    It figures. Just as American employers finally appear to be
catching on to the need for family-friendly programs and policies,
a small but vocal group comes along that seems bent on taking those
hard-won benefits away.
 &HT;    Call it a backlash, but a growing number of childless workers
are protesting what they believe to be the inequity of benefits
designed to help working parents better balance the demands of
their personal and professional lives.
 &HT;    ``Programs and policies that exclude large groups of people are
inherently unfair,'' says warehouse-software manufacturer Ann
Price, a member of The Childfree Network, a Citrus Heights,
Calif.-based advocacy group that boasts 5,000 members nationwide.
``If I don't have kids, family-friendly benefits by definition
aren't very friendly to me.''
 &HT;    New research supports the notion that some childless workers
feel they are being stiffed by their employer's focus on the needs
of co-workers with kids. For instance, some 56 percent of work-life
professionals believe that childless workers harbor resentment
toward employees with children, according to a recent survey by The
Conference Board, a business-research group in New York.
 &HT;    ``Where people feel the most discrimination is around time _
having to stay late at the office, having to finish work at home,
not being able to attend to personal responsibilities,'' says
Marcia Brumit Kropf, a vice president with Catalyst, a women's
research and consulting firm in New York. ``The real problem is how
stretched everyone feels in the workplace today.''
 &HT;    With a view toward clearing the air, here is a closer look at
the most common complaints voiced by childless workers, along with
some expert thinking about what's legitimate about the gripes,
what's not and what companies and employees can do to insure a fair
deal for all workers, whether they are parents or not.
 &HT;    + It's a family-friendly world out there.
 &HT;    If only it were true.
 &HT;    ``Over the past five years there has been a sea change in
consciousness, a general recognition that helping employees balance
their professional and private lives is an important business
issue,'' Brumit Kropf says. ``But we have a lot of work left to do
to turn that consciousness into reality.''
 &HT;    In fact, while the range of possible benefits has expanded over
the past decade, the majority of employers have yet to get with the
program.
 &HT;    Consider: Only 37 percent of companies offer paid parental
leave, only 18 percent provide any form of child-care help, such as
an on-site child-care center or backup care, and a scant 12 percent
lend a hand with adoption expenses, according to a 1996 survey of
313 companies by Buck Consultants, a New York-based
benefits-consulting firm.
 &HT;    But while family-friendly programs are not as ubiquitous as
critics claim, a climate that is generally open to family concerns
is.
 &HT;    ``Companies tend to reflect a cultural attitude that views
raising children as a kind of sacred calling,'' says Mary Young, a
researcher at Boston University's School of Management. ``Having to
get home to your kids is a high card of sorts that is hard for a
childless employee to match.''
 &HT;    What would help: The most painful work-life conflict for
employees is to not be treated with respect or recognized as a
whole person with a compelling life off the job, concludes a new
study by human-resources consultant Marci Koblenz of MK Consultants
in Evanston, Ill. And that's as true for childless employees as it
is for working parents, Koblenz found.
 &HT;    Yet the language used to describe programs to help employees
achieve balance _ phrases such as ``family-friendly'' or
``work-family'' _ inadvertently fuels divisiveness by seeming to
exclude anyone who doesn't have kids.
 &HT;    To send a more inclusive message, a growing number of firms are
changing the name of their initiatives to more neutral titles, such
as ``work-life,'' indicating that such programs are intended to
help all employees resolve conflicts between their personal and
professional responsibilities, whether or not they have children.
 &HT;    + Childless workers pick up the slack for working moms and dads.
 &HT;    Three quarters of the work-life experts surveyed by The
Conference Board disputed the notion that employees without
children carry more than their fair share of the work load.
 &HT;    ``Sure, you occasionally hear stories about childless employees
staying until 10 at night to make up the work left behind by a
working parent,'' says Catherine Popper, a vice president with WFD,
a work-family research and consulting firm in Boston. ``But those
incidents by far tend to be the exception, not the rule.''
 &HT;    When such a problem does arise, experts say, the cause can
usually be traced to how a flexible schedule was implemented, not
to the policy itself. Most typically, a well-meaning manager may
approve a working parent's request for flextime without thinking
through the consequences.
 &HT;    What would help: Companies need to train managers about how to
implement flexible schedules, work-family experts suggest. Before a
request for flextime is approved, the supervisor and employee
should discuss how the work will be accomplished and establish ways
for the employee to pass along needed information when she's not in
the office.
 &HT;    ``Managers need to treat flexibility as a business issue, a
strategy to achieve business results,'' Popper says, ``not as an
accommodation.''
 &HT;    + Childless workers do not get a fair share of the benefits pie.
 &HT;    ``An on-site child-care center or a lactation room are icons of
all the money that companies spend on employees with kids,'' says
Ann Price of The Childfree Network. ``For childless workers,
they're a constant reminder of all the benefits dollars that aren't
spent on us.''
 &HT;    Price is not alone in her views: Some 42 percent of the work-
family specialists in The Conference Board survey agreed that
employees without children feel they are subsidizing benefits for
other employees' families lives.
 &HT;    To some extent, the negative feelings simply reflect bad PR on
the part of employers. Companies don't usually talk up benefits
that are used primarily by workers without children, such as
tuition assistance and wellness programs, even though they are far
more common offerings.
 &HT;    What would help: As a first step, work-life consultants urge
companies to conduct focus groups and surveys to determine which
benefits childless employees value most.
 &HT;    ``Simply by asking, you communicate respect, which can head off
a lot of resentment,'' says Boston University's Mary Young.
 &HT;    A small but growing number of companies are designing
cafeteria-style benefits packages that can be used in different
ways by different employees, depending on their particular needs.
 &HT;    Xerox's 5-year-old LifeCycle Assistance Program is a striking
example: Employees are entitled to $10,000 over the course of their
career with the company, to be used for one of three purposes: to
help pay for child care, a down payment on a first home or
unreimbursed health-care expenses for members of one's household.
 &HT;    + Working parents feel they have a superior claim on the need to
balance work and outside interests.
 &HT;    At its most fundamental level, the tension between working
parents and childless employees boils down to a competition for
scarce resources. In this case, the resource is flexibility, which
the majority of employees want and most companies are loath to
grant across the board.
 &HT;    Do working parents have a greater claim on flexibility than
other staffers? The question is hotly debated among employees,
within the human-resources field and the larger community as well.
 &HT;    Certainly, once a company approves flextime for some employees,
it's difficult for anyone to know where to draw the line and on
what grounds. Is your sick child more important than my sick cat?
Is your need to leave on time to pick up your toddler from child
care more compelling than my need to get to a night-school class so
I can earn an MBA? Is your child's softball game more important
than my softball game?
 &HT;    What would help: Fortunately, if a flextime program is managed
correctly, employers don't really have to get into the messy
business of determining the moral merits of each request.
 &HT;    Amoco makes flextime and a compressed workweek available to all
employees, regardless of family status. Indeed, roughly 10,000
Amoco workers, or about a third of the work force, have opted for
the compressed workweek since the program was introduced
company-wide a year ago _ and the number of enrollees with and
without children is proportionate to their numbers in the work
force.
 &HT;    Certainly, the technology now exists to make such flexibility
possible, from voice mail and faxes to computers, beepers and
e-mail.
 &HT;    As Fran Rodgers, founder and CEO of WFD, observes, ``We're in
the midst of a revolution in the way work gets done.''
 &HT;    But the revolution hasn't been won yet. And until it is,
companies, working parents and childless employees must work
together to create the kind of workplace community in which
everyone is considerate of one another's needs, regardless of
family status.

THE BABE: A LARGE SLICE OF LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's intriguing to consider just how the modern media would
cover George Herman Ruth. No self-respecting journalist in this day
and age of self-promotion would let the off-field antics of the
Babe go unexposed.
</P>
<P>
   More than any other recent reports, Sunday night's HBO Sports
documentary on Ruth presents a balanced account of a complicated
man. Born and raised near the seedy Baltimore waterfront, Ruth was
the son of a saloonkeeper who ultimately sent him to St. Mary's
Reform School to live. The Babe was a troublesome child and
struggled throughout his life with philosophical issues such as
right and wrong.
</P>
<P>
   His first wife was 16 _ he was 19 _ and the child they adoped
was believed to have been the product of Ruth's affair with a maid.
Either way, he abandoned child and wife quickly, not exactly ready
to deal with commitment when there was so much fun to be had.
</P>
<P>
   And that he did, from the booze and chorus girls to the home
runs and World Series championships. He was at once celebrity and
father figure, admonishing his friends to attend Mass every Sunday
while at the same time refusing to see a priest because he had been
having a wild time with several women simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Foley has one of the best lines in the hour-long special.
He was a peanut vendor at Fenway Park and recalled the Babe helping
bag peanuts and leaving the kids $10 or $20.
</P>
<P>
   Foley also recalls the Babe cursing at kids who used foul
language.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would tell them to do what their mother and father told
them to do,'' Foley said. ``And if he heard a kid swearing, he
would yell, `Goddammit, stop that goddamn swearing.'''
</P>
<P>
   It is a classic Babe story and suggests what would be considered
hypocrisy these days. But at the time, it was considered colorful,
complicated, and, well, purely Babe.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never had a serious thought in his head,'' said one
commentator. ``But you would have liked him. He wasn't a bad
fellow.''
</P>
<P>
   HBO presents a moving tribute to commemorate the Babe on the
50th anniversary of his death at age 53. The insult of receiving a
contract for $1 from the Yankees at the end of his career and his
battle with terminal cancer were dark developments. But otherwise,
Ruth was full of life and joy, an innocent in paradise.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were to ask Babe what he thought of Einstein, he would
ask you, `What's he hittin'?''' said another commentator.
</P>
<P>
   It was a different time then. In the 1920s, baseball became the
national pastime because Ruth's slugging heroics and the sheer
force of his personality restored the game to prominence after the
1919 White Sox gambling scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``More people knew about Babe Ruth than knew about the president
in this country,'' Pete Hamill told HBO. ``And a lot more cared.''
</P>
<P>
   As Yankee great Tommy Henrich said, ``Babe Ruth is the only guy
that ever lived up to his reputation.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruth befriended everyone, including journalists who covered him.
</P>
<P>
   And he made great copy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Babe Ruth was a larger-than-life character,'' HBO Sports
executive producer Ross Greenburg said. ``His accomplishments and
impact were profound, perhaps to a degree that people born after he
retired cannot fully comprehend. Why is a man who passed away 50
years ago still the best-known figure in baseball?''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason was his prodigious talent. He averaged more
than 50 homers for six years. He retired with a .342 average, a
.690 slugging percentage, and a then-record 714 home runs. And that
was after he made the transition from pitching, at which he had
been one of the premier lefthanders in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a living man who became a mythic god,'' said journalist
Bill Gleason, ``and nothing can change that.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
A major trade

   Philadelphia-based Entercom announced Thursday that it has
agreed to swap two radio stations in Tampa for CBS's five stations
in Boston, including WEEI. The value of the exchange is estimated
at $160 million. The other Boston stations involved are WRKO, WWTM,

 By FLORENCE FELDMAN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Organization is important in everyone's life, but for the
elderly it can be the key to how well they can function
independently _ and for how long. They need to simplify their
lives, while keeping their independence and dignity.
 &HT;    However, physical limitations of age or illness, poor memory,
attachment to ``the way things were'' or simply the inability to
ask for help can get in the way.
 &HT;    My mother is 87 years old and in reasonably good health, but she
is not able to do what she used to do. As she says, ``The old gray
mare, she ain't what she used to be.''
 &HT;    Her memory fails her, she can't lift things that are the least
bit heavy and she tires rather quickly. She is in a nice retirement
home, where there are services available, but the staff there
doesn't do everything.
 &HT;    That's where I come in. I am an organizer by profession, and so
I naturally began to help my mother around her home even before she
moved to the retirement home. As things in her apartment began to
be too much for her, we began to simplify her environment.
 &HT;    We went through every room, little by little, several hours at a
time. We sorted through the contents of every closet, shelf and
drawer _ clearing out unused and unwanted items, selling or
throwing away things of no use to anyone or giving usable ``stuff''
to a local charity.
 &HT;    In the kitchen, some of the pots and pans were too heavy for Mom
to lift, even empty. Things stored in very low or high cabinets, or
way in the back of other cabinets, were now impossible to reach.
Since she was no longer giving large dinner parties, many of the
kitchen and dining-room items were no longer needed, although many
held fond memories.
 &HT;    So Mom and I decided to get the family together as we went
through this part of the sorting and simplifying process. We had
many tender moments reminiscing.
 &HT;    The ``good stuff'' was left with Mom, to be fairly divided later
on. And, of course, there were special things that Mom wanted to
give to certain people, and she took care of that. Then we boxed up
dishes and other kitchen items and took them to my house, where we
could all meet and choose what we wanted to keep without putting
Mom through the strain.
 &HT;    Every family will have its own way of sorting and letting go,
but it's important to be sensitive as we try to simplify our
parents' environments to reflect their present lifestyle needs. We
want this to be a positive change, not a trauma.
 &HT;    Most elderly people want to be independent, and the order we can
help bring into their environments helps to keep them functional.
Visibility and accessibility are the watchwords in organizing for
the elderly.
 &HT;    For example, you can replace a crowded jewelry box, where things
are hard to see, by clearing a dresser drawer and putting in lined
trays with small sections for the jewelry. Then everything is
visible upon opening the dresser drawer and that long-forgotten
jewelry can be worn.
 &HT;    In reorganizing cabinets and shelves, use containers that slide
forward easily, and put the things used most often in the most
accessible spaces.
 &HT;    Even though you will be handling many tasks for your parent,
respect his or her wishes. You are the helper, so be sure to resist
the urge to take over. It can happen easily, without your realizing
it _ after all, you are used to ordering your own life _ but it can
be very damaging to your relationship with your parent and to the
success of the simplifying process.
 &HT;    Many people ask for assistance only indirectly, if at all. As
the helping child, you must be even more observant of the parent's
needs in such a case. For example, keep an eye on the parent's
medications to be sure he or she doesn't run out and forget to get
more. If you notice spots or stains on a parent's clothing, offer
to help with the wash or take things to the cleaners.
 &HT;    You might want to compose a shopping list of the items most
regularly used, and make copies of it. Then your parent can simply
check off what is needed. If the shopping is done by others, be
sure to list the particulars: brand names, sizes, where to buy.
 &HT;    All of us have difficulty dealing with the glut of paper in our
lives, and this is increasingly the case as one gets older. For
example, outdated papers and notices can be very confusing to an
elderly person. Managing finances may also become a problem.
 &HT;    In every instance, the first step is the same: Eliminate the
unnecessary.
 &HT;    If your parent doesn't have one already, start a simple portable
filing system with only the most essential papers. Be sure to label
the folders in bold capital letters that will be easy to read. Your
job may be to keep up on the filing and to make sure all the bills
are paid, checkbooks balanced and other financial matters in order.
Be sure that all the unneeded paper is disposed of regularly.
 &HT;    Most organizing tasks can be done with your parent present and
can be a wonderful opportunity to spend meaningful time together.
You can get to know and appreciate one another in new ways.
 &HT;    However, the sessions can deteriorate into constant bickering.
If your parent gets testy, it usually indicates that you have
ignored earlier signs that his or her sense of dignity and pride
has been wounded by the need to be dependent on you.
 &HT;    Keep your eyes and ears sensitive to this natural response, and
you will earn your parent's gratitude and respect. And you will
achieve your goal: to help your parent function independently and
comfortably, for as long as possible.

 c.1997 McCall's 
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   You wake abruptly in the middle of the night. Something's wrong:
Your chest hurts, maybe, or you're flushed with sweat.
</P>
<P>
   You're miserable, and adding to the discomfort is your confusion
about how to respond. Should you roll over and rest easy, or should
you call the doctor? And if you need to call, should you do it now
or can you wait until morning?
</P>
<P>
   As you lie in bed, in the still, dark night, a panicky voice
inside may urge you to call an ambulance immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Deciding what to do can be maddening, partly because p.m. pains
often do seem far worse than a.m. aches. After all, there's really
not much else going on right then except what's hurting.
</P>
<P>
   ``At night, awareness of pain and body functions is
heightened,'' says Dr. Jay Siwek, a professor and chairman of
family medicine at Georgetown University Medical Center. ``The
commotion of the day is over, and you're more inclined to focus on
your symptoms.''
</P>
<P>
   While some nighttime problems can be treated at home or ignored,
as you grow older these aches and pains are more likely to be
messages that you need medical attention. The following is a
roundup of late-night health complaints common among people over
50, along with doctors' expert advice on the best ways for you to
respond to trouble.
 &UR; SKIPPED HEARTBEATS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You're lying quietly in bed when you feel your heart miss a
beat. Your pulse may start to race, or you may feel as if it pauses
for a second or two. These are symptoms of arrhythmia, a condition
increasingly common in people over 50.
</P>
<P>
   In women, irregular heart rhythms are especially likely to show
up around the time of menopause, physicians report. Hormonal
changes may be at work.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you sense a skipped pulse but feel fine otherwise and have
no history of heart disease, generally there's no need to worry,''
says Dr. Hugh Calkins, director of arrhythmia services at Johns
Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   If you exhibit other symptoms, or if an episode is followed by a
chaotic and irregular pulse or involves chest discomfort or
light-headedness, you do need to take action.
</P>
<P>
   The most common cause of sustained rhythm disturbances is a
condition called atrial fibrillation, in which the electrical
cardiac impulse in the upper chamber of the heart become unstable,
resulting in irregular and quivering contractions.
</P>
<P>
   ``While most are not life-threatening in themselves, some
unstable heart rhythms are associated over time with an increased
risk of stroke,'' Calkins says.
</P>
<P>
   What to do: ``Most of the time missed heartbeats aren't
serious,'' says Calkins, ``but you can't always diagnose this
yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   If an irregular pulse is accompanied by chest pain or faintness,
go to an emergency room right away or call your physician.
 &UR; CHEST PAIN &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A heart attack is the first thing most people think of when pain
grips their chest. Yet middle-of-the-night chest pain could be
brought on by a big meal or a snack eaten just before bedtime.
</P>
<P>
   When you lie flat, digestive acid may backtrack up the
esophagus. You might be able to tell the difference between
heartburn and a heart attack this way: A heart attack usually
causes bandlike pressure in the middle of the chest _ a feeling of
fullness or heaviness rather than a sharp pain. The pain may
radiate to either your arm or your jaw, and may be accompanied by
shortness of breath, sweating and/or nausea.
</P>
<P>
   Heartburn, on the other hand, is a burning sensation in the
center of the chest that radiates upward, often into the throat.
</P>
<P>
   Another way to tell the difference: ``Take an antacid, or drink
some milk,'' says Dr. Peter Rubin, a clinical associate professor
of medicine and gastroenterology at the Mount Sinai School of
Medicine in New York City. ``If the pain goes away within a few
minutes, you've diagnosed and temporarily cured heartburn.''
</P>
<P>
   What to do: Head off heartburn by avoiding late-night raids on
the refrigerator. If chest pain persists or comes on with nausea,
sweating, dizziness and/or shortness of breath, it's urgent that
you call your physician, dial 911 or have someone drive you to a
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Some doctors advise taking an aspirin immediately to dissolve
any possible blood clot. Bring blood-pressure or other medications
with you to the hospital to help the staff assess your needs.
</P>
<P>
   And what if you simply don't feel quite right but don't want to
make a fuss? Not all heart attacks have chest pain as a main
symptom, so self-diagnosis can be tricky. It's better to go to the
hospital or call your doctor than risk misdiagnosing yourself.
 &UR; NIGHT SWEATS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You awaken in the middle of the night, drenched. Among women,
this often results from the hormonal changes of menopause. Ask your
doctor about estrogen-replacement therapy, which can help ease this
and other symptoms as your body adjusts to new hormone levels.
</P>
<P>
   Night bouts of perspiration can also be triggered by pneumonia.
A case of it involving a small percentage of the lung may not be
severe enough to keep you down-and-out during the day _ this is
what's commonly called walking pneumonia. Watch for physical
symptoms like low fever, coughing and chest pain.
</P>
<P>
   There are some less likely causes of troubling night sweats,
including certain medications, a heart attack or heart disease,
lymphoma and AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   What to do: If you're often up because of night sweats, or if
they persist for several weeks, see your doctor.
 &UR; TWITCHES AND CRAMPS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You're drifting off to sleep when one of your legs twitches or
your whole body jerks _ and you're awake. Annoying, but normal.
These involuntary movements are known to occur when you shift from
one stage of sleep into another. They are caused by a sudden
electrical discharge within the nerves.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no apparent reason for them,'' Siwek says, ``and
since they're not dangerous to you, no preventive measures are
needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, a leg cramp or charley horse in your calf muscle that
disrupts your slumber is distressing but generally not a cause for
worry.
</P>
<P>
   What to do: To prevent pesky, painful leg cramps, try this
exercise before bedtime: Sit on the floor with your legs
outstretched. Flex your toes toward your knees, so your calves and
foot muscles are stretched and limbered. Hold for several minutes.
This exercise may also help to relieve a cramp.
 &UR; DIZZINESS AND LIGHT-HEADEDNESS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Have you ever rolled over at night and snuggled deep into your
pillow, only to feel as if you're still rolling and the room is
spinning?
</P>
<P>
   ``You may have a problem with inner-ear balance, triggered by a
virus or hereditary factors,'' says Dr. Blackwell Evans, an
associate professor of medicine at the Tulane University Medical
Center in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Call your doctor the following day for a checkup.
</P>
<P>
   Light-headedness when you stand up _ to go to the bathroom, say
_ is caused by a drop in either blood pressure or pulse rate and
can be triggered in several ways. Rising too quickly can cause the
wobbles in people who have low blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, blood-pressure or heart medications, diuretics and
some antidepressants can bring on light-headedness. Check with your
doctor if you take any of these medications and experience
dizziness.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Evans says, be aware that ``stroke is a possibility when
dizziness is also accompanied by a lack of coordination, slurred
speech or numbness of the face. This constellation of symptoms
requires immediate medical attention.''
</P>
<P>
   What to do: Slight light-headedness after standing up from a
reclining or sitting position is probably not cause for alarm. But
vertigo that persists or is accompanied by a lack of coordination
or a numbness of the face requires that you seek immediate medical
attention.

 By EVE GLICKSMAN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Were you ever at the mall and couldn't remember where you parked
the car? Gotten home from the market and realized you forgot the
milk? And your daughter's anniversary has never slipped your mind
... until this year.
 &HT;    It's so frustrating, and worse, if you're getting on in years,
you worry whether this could be the beginnings of Alzheimer's
disease, the devastating disorder associated with aging and memory
loss.
 &HT;    According to memory experts, though, it's not time to panic.
Most likely, you're suffering from a common condition referred to
as age-associated memory impairment, or ``benign forgetfulness.''
And with a little strategy and perseverance, you can even learn how
to compensate for it. Relax, you're not losing your mind!
 &HT;    Who said it's all downhill from here? Contrary to what was once
thought, senility is not inevitable as times passes. Twenty percent
of mature adults experience no discernible drop in their mental
faculties.
 &HT;    Researchers, in fact, have found that poor memory in mature
adults can be a self-fulfilling prophecy. That is, if you believe
your memory gets worse when you get older, you give up more easily.
 &HT;    In China, where there are no stereotypes about age and mental
decline, seniors performed much better on tests than same-aged
Americans.
 &HT;    But age can take a toll, and IQ has nothing to do with it. The
first sign is slower recall and more difficulty learning new
things, says geriatric psychiatrist Dr. Gary Gottlieb, director and
chief executive officer of Friends Hospital in Philadelphia. Your
ability to memorize an address given to you in a distracting
environment like a party may drop off. Or you may need to pause a
few seconds to come up with the name of the movie you saw last
night.
 &HT;    You may start to notice the changes in your 30s, but it's
generally not significant until you're 60, Gottlieb notes. And what
is normal may surprise you: In a national study on memory loss by
the Charles A. Dana Foundation, nearly half of 45-year-olds
surveyed said they had problems recalling names.
 &HT;    There are actually three types of memory, each influenced
differently by age, explains Dr. Milton Alter, clinical professor
of neurology at Allegheny University of the Health Sciences in
Philadelphia.
 &HT;    Long-term memory enables you to remember things about your best
friend in grade school and is the least affected by advancing
years. Intermediate memory _ say, remembering an appointment _ may
wane a little more over time.
 &HT;    Most vulnerable to age is short-term memory, says Dr. Alter, a
neuroepidemiologist. This is why you may be flabbergasted to find
you can't remember something you were discussing 10 minutes ago.
 &HT;    To understand how memory works, think about it as a three-step
process. First, you receive the information; then, you store it;
eventually, you retrieve it.
 &HT;    Memory loss can occur at the first step, for instance, if you
weren't concentrating when someone was telling you something. While
it's true that we lose upward of 50,000 brain cellS a day (eek!)
and that our brains peak in young adulthood, it's the way we encode
and retrieve information _ steps two and three _ that cause most
memory lapses in the elderly, says Dr. Thomas Swirsky-Sachetti, a
neuropsychologist and associate professor at Jefferson Medical
College in Philadelphia.
 &HT;    ``In your younger days, you could just let that grocery list
wash over you one time without thinking. Older people have to be
more active and conscious about encoding the information in their
brains,'' says Swirsky-Sachetti.
 &HT;    Mature adults, he explains, must develop strategies to file
their thoughts so they are easier to retrieve. Because their minds
have accumulated so much information over the years, their memory
banks are difficult to sort through and access otherwise.
Visualization, associations and written reminders may do the trick.
 &HT;    Nor is it always age. Medical problems can affect your memory,
too. Psychological stress such as grief or fatigue, substance
abuse, vitamin deficiencies or illnesses from thyroid disease to
infections can all interfere with remembering.
 &HT;    More startling, 15 to 20 percent of memory problems in the
elderly are caused or worsened by medications they are taking,
Gottlieb says.
 &HT;    Even your mood can cause forgetfulness. Depression is
responsible for 10 percent of memory complaints in those over 65,
says Swirsky-Sacchetti, who does testing of memory and other
cognitive functions. Anxiety _ having a lot on your mind _ also
hampers memory, he adds.
 &HT;    If you're worried about your memory or that of someone close to
you, talk to your primary care physician first, Gottlieb says. If
needed, your doctor can refer you to a specialist who can perform a
complete evaluation that would include a physical exam, personal
interview and screening tests that measure a range of cognitive
skills, including concentration and orientation.
 &HT;    If you're under age 75, the chances are you don't have
Alzheimer's or clementia. In these diseases, memory loss is usually
accompanied by other problems, such as speaking difficulty,
disorientation or a sudden inability to perform familiar tasks.
 &HT;    Another tip-off: Over a period of six months, the person with
dementia or Alzheimer's will show a progressive decline, as opposed
to the spotty defects of someone with normal memory loss, Alter
says.
 &HT;    Much like muscles that grow flabby if not exercised, your memory
requires daily toning. Some researchers speculate that memory loss
blamed on physical aging may be an offshoot of retirement when
mental activity can fall off. The golden rule of memory is ``use it
or lose it.''
 &HT;    ``Remain active in tasks that require thinking _ travel,
discussion groups, museum-going, concerts, reading, socializing and
new opportunities,'' Alter recommends. Consider that your abstract
abilities and vocabulary can improve well into your senior years
with continued learning.
 &HT;    You can even have fun while tuning up your memory. Many find
that playing cards, doing crosswords or taking interesting classes
works for them. Regular physical exercise that improves circulation
_ how about dancing? _ can sharpen the brain's performance as well.
 &HT;    Try to lay off optional medications, too. To get to sleep, try
listening to music or reading instead of taking sleeping pills that
can cloud memory, Alter suggests.
 &HT;    ``Sleeping pills, relaxants, anti-anxiety medications and
moderate amounts of alcohol all can interfere with alertness
because the mature person's tolerance to them is reduced,'' he
says.
 &HT;    Think of practicing the memory strategies listed below as the
equivalent of wearing glasses for failing eyes. It's no shame, and
a small effort to make for being able to find those darn keys!
 -0- 
 SIDEBAR: IMPROVING RECALL  
 &HT;    Recalling names: Conjure up a mental picture or association to
remember names. Repeat the name in conversation and ask how to
spell it.
 &HT;    Absent-mindedness: Block out distractions. When you run upstairs
to get your checkbook, think about nothing else until the item is
in your hand. If you're interrupted, cue yourself by turning a
watch or ring inward as a reminder that you were in the middle of
doing something.
 &HT;    On the tip of your tongue: Anxiety is a mental block, which is
why wracking your brain for a word usually doesn't work. The
thought will likely pop into your head later when the mind has more
time to scan its reserves. Sometimes, running through letters in
the alphabet can trigger the sound of the word you're searching
for.
 &HT;    Losing things: Select a permanent place for frequently misplaced
items such as keys. Say out loud for reinforcement, ``I'm leaving
the keys on the hallway table.'' To find a missing item, retrace
your steps and recall as many details as possible. One recollection
can trigger others.
 &HT;    Where's the car?: Before you walk away from your parked car,
pretend that your mind is a camera and record a snapshot
perspective of your car's location. At the mall, be attentive to
landmarks such as banners or storefronts. Better yet, try parking
in the same area each time.

 By ANN ORR  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Seventy-five-year-old Rollie Howes never figured he'd have any
use for computers, much less the Internet. But thanks to some
persistent arm-twisting by his nephew, he borrowed a laptop
computer and took the plunge.
 &HT;    Within 24 hours, Howes went from techno-novice to dedicated Web
surfer. The clincher was when he was able to locate long-lost
photos of the submarine he served on in World War II.
 &HT;    Howes is in good company on the Net, with more and more seniors
going online every day. Retired Rutgers professor Isabel Wolock
used the Internet to book a vacation villa in Spain and keeps up
with book, movie and theater reviews by visiting the New York Times
Web site.
 &HT;    Sixty-one-year-old auto executive John Grettenberger uses
America Online's Personal Finance Channel to track his investments
and frequents the Mayo Clinic's site for the latest information on
health-related issues.
 &HT;    There's something for everyone on the Net, whether you're 7 or
70. For seniors who have never touched a computer, how to get
started is the biggest concern _ and, indeed, getting hooked up is
the greatest challenge of the whole online experience.
 &HT;    Perhaps the best way to begin is with the help of a friend who's
already computer-savvy. If technology-minded friends are in short
supply, there's a terrific paperback book, ``Young   Heart,
Computing for Seniors'' (McGraw-Hill, 1996, $22.95), that tells you
all you need to know to successfully use a computer and hook up to
the Internet.
 &HT;    Classes in computer use and the Internet, offered by public
libraries and community colleges, are another popular and
affordable way in which people of all ages can get started.
 &HT;    Once you're online, the choices of interesting things to do are
endless. E-mail is particularly useful; it's a great way to stay in
touch with friends and the grandchildren. You can even send them
animated, talking greeting cards.
 &HT;    A growing number of quality Web sites are being created
especially for older computer users. In addition to news, feature
articles and advice, many have ``chat rooms'' or bulletin boards
where visitors can gather to ``talk'' and exchange information.
 &HT;    On the Internet you'll find information on virtually any topic,
including health, nutrition, travel, finance and various leisure
activities.
 &HT;    Get connected, and check out these great Web sites:
 STARTER SITES  
 &HT;    + SeniorCom (www.Senior.com). Want to check out retirement
communities without leaving your house? How about chat with others
or find out what events and classes are scheduled in your area? You
can do all this and more at this informative site. Best of all,
there are hundreds of links to other useful Web sites focusing on
travel, health and wellness, social security, services for the
aging and more.
 &HT;    + The American Association of Retired Persons (www.aarp.org).
Here's the place to find out where the AARP stands on issues of
importance to seniors. There's also a wealth of information on such
topics as health and aging, money management, wills and living
trusts, and grandparents raising grandchildren. AARP members can
get discounts on car rentals, hotels, airlines and even online
services (800-424-3410).
 &HT;    + SeniorNet (www.SeniorNet.com). This nonprofit organization's
site offers chat rooms and discussions on politics, travel,
gardening and health, with links to senior organizations and
publications on the Web. SeniorNet also teaches adults (age
50-plus) to use computers and the Internet at more than 140
learning centers nationwide. Call 415-495-4990 for information on
courses.
 TRAVEL  
 &HT;    + CyberRentals (http://cyberrentals.com). Planning a vacation?
Visit this site that lists homes, condos, chalets and other real
estate available for rent. Booking a beach house in the Virgin
Islands or a waterfront cottage on Lake Michigan has never been
easier. Each listing includes a description and photo of the
accommodations, rates and contact information.
 &HT;    + Yahoo! Seniors' Travel Pages
(www.yahoo.com/Recreation/Travel/Seniors/Airline_Programs/). If you
need to make an airline reservation, be sure to stop by this site
first. You'll find information about special fares as well as links
to several major airlines' senior citizen discount programs. Other
features of this Web site include car rental and hotel
accommodations information plus a mechanism for checking flight
times.
 HEALTH AND NUTRITION  
 &HT;    + Mayo Health Oasis (www.mayohealth.org). For information on
health, nutrition and exercise, the Mayo Clinic's site is terrific.
The Medicine Center pages are particularly useful; you can look up

 By JERE DANIEL  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    It was a gray November day when my wife and I drove up to her
83-year-old mother's home in suburban New York. As we trudged up
the crumbling front steps, we stopped, stared and asked each other
the same question: ``How will she make it through another winter?
Who's going to shovel the driveway when it snows? And who'll fix
these steps?''
 &HT;    On our next visit, my wife summoned up the courage to ask her
iron-willed mother, Fay, whether she didn't think it was time to
consider living someplace else.
 &HT;    Remembering the previous year's Siberian winter, Fay hesitated.
Finally she asked, ``But where would I go?''
 &HT;    It took many months of searching to answer that question, but we
eventually learned that there is a large and growing range of
housing options for the elderly _ be they able-bodied or in need of
regular medical care _ all of them tailored to preserve what older
people want most: their independence.
 &HT;    The best solution for my mother-in-law proved to be a co-op
apartment in a building that has a ``buddy system'' whereby
residents look after one another. The building is located in the
same town she has always lived in, but in an area that has stores
and apartment buildings that have attracted many of its older
residents.
 &HT;    Here are some other elder housing choices that we considered.
 HOME-SHARING  
 &HT;    Sharing living space with a roommate is perhaps the simplest and
most underused way for an elderly person to alleviate loneliness
and strained finances. The practice is becoming increasingly
popular, however, especially with women over the age of 65, says
Jon Pynoos, director of the National Resource and Policy Center on
Housing and Long-Term Care at the University of Southern California
in Los Angeles.
 &HT;    Home-sharing may mean simply renting out a vacant room, or it
may involve modifying one's home to turn unused space into living
quarters.
 &HT;    The National Shared Housing Resource Center in Baltimore is a
nonprofit agency that screens and matches those who need a home
with those who wish to share theirs, making home-sharing safe and
systematic. The center works through 350 local affiliates and has
made thousands of matches, says its director, Mark Benson.
 &HT;    ``We also provide publications and technical assistance for
those who want to convert and finance homes for sharing,'' he adds.
 COOPERATIVE LIVING  
 &HT;    Communes _ communities where people share work and
responsibilities for each other, and live in commonly owned housing
on commonly owned land _ exist throughout the country and are
actually on the increase. Most of them are intergenerational, that
is, filled with people of every age, a factor that makes them
especially attractive to older people.
 &HT;    A new variation of the traditional commune is called cohousing.
In these newer style communes, residents still co-own the land and
benefit from central services such as meals and recreation, but
live in individually owned homes on the property.
 &HT;    Cohousing communities are often started from scratch. People
bent on creating a community purchase land together, then build
homes and a large community house. They govern their community
democratically, often sharing social activities, meals, child care
and maintenance equipment such as trucks, snow plows and
lawnmowers.
 ECHO HOUSING  
 &HT;    ECHO houses are attractive compact homes, fully equipped and
often all or partially prefabricated, that are placed next to a
parent house _ frequently that of a grown childfrom which they
typically draw utilities and water.
 &HT;    In Australia, where they originated, they are called granny
flats; grandchildren can drop in several times during the day for
cookies and milk, and grown sons and daughters can keep a watchful,
caring eye on their parents.
 &HT;    ECHO houses (an acronym for Elder Cottage Housing Opportunities)
are sometimes subsidized by community social service agencies. Or
they may be purchased for $26,000 to $36,000. When the ECHO house
is no longer needed, it can be resold, moved and hooked up at
another site.
 CONGREGATE HOUSING  
 &HT;    Congregate housing typically consists of 20 or 30 small living
units (each with bedroom, bath and sometimes cooking facilities) in
one building or in a group of buildings joined to a hub facility
that provides meals and social activities.
 &HT;    While congregate communities are primarily for ambulatory
seniors, most such facilities do have an on-site supervisor for
safety and security, and ready access to local health services for
routine medical care and emergencies.
 &HT;    Congregate housing is often sponsored by social, religious,
fraternal or community agencies.
 ASSISTED LIVING  
 &HT;    Essentially, assisted living is a residence for the mentally
and/or physically frail who do not quite need the full care of a
nursing home but do need some personal care and supervision
available around the clock.
 &HT;    Some candidates for assisted living may suffer frequent
confusion and bouts of forgetfulness and need help with daily
routines. Residents receive their meals, assistance with
medications, grooming and other personal care according to their
individual needs, limited health-care services, supervision and
companionship.
 &HT;    Assisted-living residences _ which typically feel more homey
than institutional _ are usually for-profit businesses.
 &HT;    Whitney Redding, spokeswoman for the Assisted Living Federation
of America, a trade organization based in Fairfax, Va., says,
``What makes assisted living unique is its philosophy of promoting
independence and dignity for residents in a comfortable, homelike
setting.''
 CONTINUING CARE  
 &HT;    Continuing care retirement communities (CCRCs) may consist of a
single building or a whole village serving 500 residents.
 &HT;    CCRCs accommodate everyone from the totally independent to the
completely incapacitated in units ranging from small houses and
apartments to full-fledged nursing homes. They provide a lifetime
continuum of housing and health care. Residents move from level to
level as their health changes.
 &HT;    While some facilities are sponsored by community, religious or
fraternal organizations, a growing number are run by commercial
interests such as hotel chains and insurance companies. Residents
pay monthly fees starting at about $2,000, which guarantees them
the care they need.
 &HT;    At the luxury end of continuing-care retirement communities,
residents pay a substantial entry fee _ of several hundred thousand
dollars _ and purchase the guarantee of care for the rest of their
lives in plush accommodations. They get all home maintenance,
recreation and nursing care for as long as they need it, paying
monthly fees of anywhere from $750 to several thousand dollars.
 &HT;    CCRC payment arrangements vary from facility to facility. Be
sure never to sign a contract without checking its provisions _ and
the sponsor's financial stability _ with a lawyer.
 &HT;    The American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) and the
American Association of Homes and Services for the Aging (AAHSA)
offer guides spelling out such precautions.
 &HT;    A personal visit is essential before selecting any elder living
arrangement. The AARP and AAHSA can provide you with a checklist to
help you evaluate a facility. Observe the staff for its competence
and friendliness; rate both the living quarters and health-care
services.
 &HT;    Remember that if you are selecting a new home for an elderly
parent or other relative, you should be as critical as you would be
for yourself.

PATRIOTS DEEP IN DEFENSIVE LINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SMITHFIELD, R.I. _ You quickly learn that this group is
intriguing when one of its interplanetary members says, ``I've
never been to Mexico, but I have been abducted before. Yep. I've
been hit by lightning and I've been abducted.''
</P>
<P>
   You ask this very large man, who will be making his first trip
to Mexico next week, exactly when and where he was hit by
lightning.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my house,'' he says. ``I was knocked off the couch. I swear
to God. Remember those big thunderstorms we were having in May? I'm
not lying. I swear. A big flashlight came in the window. Huge
thunderstorm. I was hit.''
</P>
<P>
   He laughs. You begin to wonder if this is what the Patriots had
in mind when they talked about their defensive line being a very
diverse group. So, you ask Chad Eaton, who's competing for a
starting defensive tackle job, when was he whisked away by aliens
or Trekkies or a group of sci-fi experimentalists?
</P>
<P>
   ``That was in 1984,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   You ask where he went.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you.''
</P>
<P>
   So it's settled. If you wanted to put together a wide-ranging
poll on NFL opinions, the Patriots defensive linemen would be
perfect. They have very young people, those teetering between youth
and veteran status, and a few old guys, although ``Hank is going to
kill me for saying ``old guys,' '' defensive line coach Ray
Hamilton says of Henry Thomas. They have speed rushers and bull
rushers. Those who have been hyped and those who have been
overlooked. Those who have had their hair bleached blond and those
who are on the verge of having dreadlocks. And, yes, those who have
been abducted.
</P>
<P>
   Move those varied personalities onto the field and you have a
team strength. You also have a potential problem. Understand that
quality linemen are in the same category as major league pitchers.
Teams never feel they have enough of them. But the Patriots have
enough (last year they kept eight linemen). So many that the ones
who don't make the team won't have a problem finding a new job.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an entire group that is real deep. I wouldn't want
BG's job this year,'' Ferric Collons says of Bobby Grier, the
team's top personnel man. ``They can't keep everybody. That's just
a fact of the game. I wouldn't want to be the man having to make
those decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Let's see. There's Eaton, Collons, and Thomas. Willie McGinest,
Mark Wheeler, and Brandon Mitchell. Chris Sullivan, Greg Spires,
and Devin Wyman. Mike Jones, Leonta Rheams, and Artie Smith.
</P>
<P>
   There isn't much fluff among that group. Hamilton said earlier
this week that the idea is to play all the linemen who are on the
team's active roster come Sept. 7 when the season opens. There will
be no backups just for the sake of having backups. We have heard
stories about the Patriots' running back problems, leading some to
joke Wednesday that visiting commentator and retired Raider/Chief
Marcus Allen was the best back in town. Defensive line, though, is
a team strength. Late summer days can become tiresome when there is
no zip in the training camp air. The linemen have made things
interesting for themselves by creating several competitions.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most prominent is the quirky Eaton vs. Wheeler, a
seven-year veteran. Both want the lead nose tackle position.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm afraid of is: I don't want to walk out there with the
second-string line anymore,'' Eaton says. ``I'm not part of that
anymore. I don't want to be a backup role player. I want to be a
guy Pete Carroll can count on. Where he can say, `It's first and
goal; put him in there.'''
</P>
<P>
   Wheeler sees Eaton coming. He's a veteran, so he knows this is
not the same Eaton who was once so unwanted that he went to his
neighborhood Kinko's and faxed a job request to an Arena Football
League team in San Jose. Or the Eaton who claims he sat in his
apartment for a week, waiting on phone calls. When the calls
weren't business-related, he would cut them short because ``I
couldn't afford call-waiting.'' Or the Eaton Bill Parcells used to
psych up on the practice squad, telling him to ravenously chase
down the first-team offense.
</P>
<P>
   It's not like that anymore. Eaton came into camp saying he
wanted to do what Wheeler does because ``Mark's a great defensive
tackle.'' Wheeler doesn't mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, having all these guys around definitely makes the game
go by quicker,'' he says. ``It keeps everybody fresh. That's what
you need when you're trying to get to the Super Bowl. We need depth
like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton says he likes the intelligence of his linemen. He often
sits with them and shows them what to look for in films of
offensive linemen. Who is more vulnerable to speed rushes? Who
looks weak when pressured to the right? Who has the best footwork?
Now Hamilton doesn't have to worry about being a sole group leader
because Thomas and McGinest are good filmgoers, too.
</P>
<P>
   But soon enough, some of the film students will have to leave.
Collons is right. The Patriots can't keep them all. There was a
good line in place last season. Now the team has added Spires, a
rookie from Florida State who didn't get a lot of college acclaim
because he played alongside Andre Wadsworth, the third pick in the
1998 draft. ``People say he's too small,'' Hamilton says of the
6-foot-1-inch, 260-pound Spires. ``They said the same thing about
Hugh Douglas (now with the Eagles), and he was defensive rookie of
the year. I like those small guys.''
</P>
<P>
   And big guys. And soon-to-be-dreadlocked guys (Collons). And
guys who have seen all this before (Jones).
</P>
<P>
   ``You get used to the competition,'' says Jones, one of the men
who could get caught in the lineman shuffle. ``So it becomes: Go
for what you know.''
</P>
<P>
   He is asked how he is doing compared with everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess all right,'' he says. ``The staff knows what I can do.
If they like it, fine. If not ... Know what I mean?''
</P>
<P>
   Yes. If they don't like it, maybe another team going waiver-wire
shopping will.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd hope so,'' Jones says.
</P>
<P>
   No one is to that point yet. There are still three practice
games to play, the next one against the Cowboys in Mexico City
Monday. Spires was the star of the previous two exhibitions. On
Monday, it could be Mitchell, Sullivan, or Jones. Or Eaton.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the 300-pound lineman who is fascinated by interior
designing, are there any updates on the '84 abduction?
</P>
<P>
   ``Ask me at the start of the season,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe we're asking too late, but is this Eaton well?
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not as crazy as he wants everybody to think,'' Collons
says. ``Chad's a new dad. He's mellowed out. He used to be a little
off the hook. But let me tell you something: If I was going to war,
I'd want him on my side.''
</P>
<P>
   In less than a month, Collons will be preparing for real games.
Eaton will be on his side. So will five or six other linemen.
Patriots fans should take comfort in knowing all of those linemen
will be good players. They should also be glad they don't have the
responsibility of Grier, who will most certainly have to release a
quality big guy.

ZAMPESE: OFFENSE NOT IN DRIVER'S SEAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SMITHFIELD, R.I. _ Ernie Zampese hasn't been around Boston long,
but he's been here long enough to understand the best way to
describe the struggling nature of his team's offense to New
England's worried football fans. So Thursday he talked about being
lost in traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to speed everything up, and it's like all of a
sudden, you're driving a car in Kansas City,'' the Patriots' new
offensive coordinator explained. ``You don't know where you're
going, so you're not moving too fast. You're hesitating. Then you
come back to Boston and you know just where the off ramp is. You
know what lane to be in and when you have to move over to the right
and where to get off.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, you're going full speed again, which after two
exhibition games, New England's offense is not. That the Patriots
have struggled thus far to execute Zampese's timing-based passing
game, with its short three-step and five-step drops and quick
decision-making, has been obvious but not unexpected. The
development of timing, by its very nature, takes time, and there is
no one who understands that better than Zampese.
</P>
<P>
   He knows quarterback Drew Bledsoe must grow accustomed to making
his drops quicker and letting the ball fly sooner, without benefit
of seeing his receivers breaking into the open, which is an act of
faith not easy to make at first.
</P>
<P>
   He knows those receivers must get used to reading defenses
quickly and coming to the same conclusions about them as Bledsoe.
They must then get to specific spots at the same time the ball
does. That is always the aim, of course, but it's not always as
simple as you might think until everyone understands exactly what
Zampese's system is asking of them.
</P>
<P>
   Ernie Zampese has been around pro football for three decades, so
he understands what this all means. Unfortunately, not everyone
watching his offense operate lately shares either his eye or his
patience, which has caused the pressure to mount only weeks into
that offense's birthing process in New England.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all getting a little frustrated,'' Zampese said. ``Like
everybody, you want it to happen. It will. We just need more reps.
We've put a lot in and we're trying to speed everything up. The
drops. The decision-making. As Drew does these things more and
more, the latter gets speeded up.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we took a whole practice and just worked on one play 60
times in a row, a guy will start to feel pretty comfortable with
that play. But you can't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Until Bledsoe and his receivers reach that comfort level with a
lot of plays, things will very likely continue as they have. Thus
far, Bledsoe has completed only 41.7 percent of his throws (10 of
24) and is averaging barely 4 yards a completion (4.04). He has no
touchdowns, two interceptions, and has not looked good.
</P>
<P>
   Neither has his offense, which has not scored a first-half
touchdown and is averaging only 230.5 yards of total production a
game. Obviously, there is only one way to describe that. Not good.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Bledsoe knows internally that he is getting closer. He knows
he and his receivers were closer last week to success than they
were the week before. Most of all, he knows there are still three
exhibition games and nearly a month of practices left before the
season opener in Denver, which at this level of football is a
lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   He knows, in other words, that he will get many more
repetitions, many more opportunities to read, react, and, most of
all, throw.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quarterback is all about reps and being able to adjust,''
Bledsoe said. ``At whatever level _ high school, college, or the
pros _ the reads are the same and the pictures you get are the
same, but you have to have a chance to see them.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe has not yet had that chance often enough in game
conditions, and it may show again Monday night in Mexico City,
where the Patriots will play the Dallas Cowboys. Zampese
understands that because he knows his system is initially fighting
a quarterback's natural instinct, which is to hold the ball until
his receiver is running free. Understanding it, however, is not the
same as accepting it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to do this a few times,'' Zampese said. ``Drew is
taking a five-step drop, and on the fifth step, we want him to
throw it. So he goes and does it and the receiver's not out there.
Next time, he's thinking, `I better wait.' It's just a little
different for him still, and that makes you hesitate. That's what
we got.''
</P>
<P>
   What the struggling Patriot offense has is hesitation, because
things are new and different and all the signs aren't quite clear
yet to the driver or his passengers. So they are moving slower, one
foot on the accelerator and the other tapping the brakes, just like
you'd do trying to find that off ramp in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   But the point to remember, as Ernie Zampese knows, is that if
you can drive, eventually you'll find that off ramp and head for
home. And when you do, you'll be flying again.

ACCORDION PLAYERS SEEK A SPOT IN THE RECORD BOOKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EVE MITCHELL  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MENLO PARK, Calif. _ Some might call it the ultimate squeeze
play: Hundreds of avid accordion players are expected to gather
here next month in an attempt to earn a spot in the Guinness Book
of World Records.
</P>
<P>
   Jamis MacNiven, a restaurateur in Woodside, Calif., hopes to set
the record for the most accordion players gathered at one time to
play ``Lady of Spain.''
</P>
<P>
   The musicians won't be out to break any records because no one
else has tried. So no matter how many players show up, they will be
accordion pioneers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no record (to break) so we will be setting the
record,'' MacNiven said.
</P>
<P>
   MacNiven is optimistic that he'll meet his goal of at least 500
accordion players for the morning gathering Sept. 20 that will
feature the official instrument of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many accordion players out there,'' he said.
``It's really amazing. They get so little respect that a lot of
them are thrilled to be in the largest accordion band ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Dubbed the Accordion Invasion, the parade of musicians will kick
off the second annual Sand Hill Challenge, a modern soap box derby
that takes place in Menlo Park.
</P>
<P>
   The race attracts entries from Silicon Valley venture
capitalists and high-tech companies. Proceeds go to local youth
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Why the accordion? ``The accordion marches well and it sounds
great and it doesn't need amplification and it's also nostalgia,''
MacNiven said. ``It's an instrument a lot of kids in crew cuts were
brought up with it and then it disappeared from view. Well, it's
back again.''
</P>
<P>
   Marian Kelly, president of the San Francisco-based Bay Area
Accordion Club, said it has never been a neutral instrument.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a certain period when the accordion kind of fell
from grace,'' with the rise of rock and roll, she said. ``I think
(young people) just kind of found the accordion as square. Now,
we're in a much more accepting mode.''
</P>
<P>
   The club, which has a membership of 325, was formed in 1990, the
same year that the pleated-player became San Francisco's official
instrument.
</P>
<P>
   There can never be too many accordion players, said the man who
spearheaded the city's official instrument drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't have too many people playing at a single event
because of the fabulous music that's played on the accordion,''
said Tom Torriglia of All Things Accordion of San Francisco. ``If
you're the greatest accordion player in the world, if you're just a
beginner, if you just want to learn that morning, that's fine with
us.''
</P>
<P>
   The accordionists will be preceded in the parade by a contingent
of bagpipe players, because MacNiven explained, the bagpipes always
come before accordions in a marching band.

LIBERTY COS. BUYS ANOTHER ASSET FIRM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE BAILEY AND STEVEN SYRE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is this the way to build a money management empire?
</P>
<P>
   Liberty Financial Cos. of Boston struck its latest deal in a
summer shopping spree yesterday by acquiring Societe Generale Asset
Management Corp., which invests $5 billion, and its star money
manager Jean-Marie Eveillard. Price tag: up to $216 million.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, Liberty Financial has spent $147.5 million to
purchase Crabbe Huson Group, which manages about $5.3 billion, and
bought Progress Investment Management Co., overseeing $2.5 billion,
for an undisclosed sum.
</P>
<P>
   These firms will be added to the group of money managers Liberty
has already collected, including Colonial Group, Stein Roe &AMP;
Farnham, and Newport Pacific Management Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The stable of firms, which manage a combined $54 billion, make
up about half of Liberty's business. The rest is generated by the
company's big annuity operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've really built out a very full and, we think, a robust
product line,'' said Liberty Financial's chief executive, Ken
Leibler.
</P>
<P>
   Robust could be a stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Liberty Financial filled a long-standing gap in its money
manager lineup by acquiring SoGen, a diversified international
investor, and Eveillard, one of the few marquee names in the field.
</P>
<P>
   But Liberty Financial also will buy a company that has struggled
in recent times, a recurring theme in its acquisitions this year.
The firms pursued by Liberty Financial may be part of a smart
long-term plan, but they have a habit of limping to the table.
</P>
<P>
   Eveillard's SoGen International, a mutual fund that contains
most of the firm's assets under management, has lost 1.5 percent
over the last year and ranks in the last quarter of the global fund
field for 1-, 3- and 5-year performances, according to Lipper
Analytical Services Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Performance has taken a toll on SoGen's business recently. The
New York-based company managed net sales of $70 million last year
but has seen shareholder redemptions outpace new sales by $650
million through the first half of 1998, according to Financial
Research Corp., a Boston-based firm.
</P>
<P>
   SoGen recorded net sales of more than $1 billion in the better
days of 1996. The company is the US mutual funds unit of Societe
Generale SA, one of France's largest banks.
</P>
<P>
   Leibler describes the problems as a short-term setback for a
proven and popular manager. Some outsiders agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jean-Marie Eveillards come around every few years and they
were able to nail this one,'' said Burton Greenwald, an industry
consultant based in Philadelphia. ``When the tide changes, it will
pay off big-time for Liberty.''
</P>
<P>
   An even stronger investment tide was working against Crabbe
Huson when it struck a deal with Liberty Financial in June. The
firm, once a hot shop with a value-oriented investment style _
picking stocks it believes are underpriced and will appreciate over
time _ has been crushed in the otherwise strong stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Its Crabbe Huson Special fund has lost 36.1 percent in the last
year, ranking it dead last among 291 mid-capitalization funds
tracked by Lipper. The Crabbe Huson Small Cap fund has lost 24.8
percent in the same period, worse than all but two of 540 funds in
its category, according to Lipper.
</P>
<P>
   Customers pulled about $140 million out of Crabbe Huson's mutual
funds in the first half of this year, following net redemptions of
about $130 million last year, according to Financial Research Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Leibler said the bulk of Crabbe Huson's business, managing about
$4 billion for institutional clients, has actually been growing. He
said the firm's performance has suffered only because its
investment style fell out of favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think value will have its day, as it always has had
historically,'' Leibler said.
</P>
<P>
   Liberty Financial had been in the hunt for yet another
well-known mutual fund firm with slumping short-term results in the
spring. The company was widely reported, in this column and
elsewhere, to be leading the chase for the $6.1 billion Kaufmann
fund. Eventually, all the companies pursuing the fund lost
interest.
</P>
<P>
   Liberty Financial has experience waiting for investment trends
to turn around. Colonial, a Boston-based bond shop, was its first
big purchase, in 1994, and fixed-income investments have been out
of favor ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Colonial sales exceeded redemptions by $178 million in the
second quarter this year. But it was the first quarter since early
1991 in which customers gave the company more money than they
pulled out.
</P>
<P>
   Newport Pacific Management, a well-known name among Asian-stock
mutual fund firms, was on a roll when it was acquired by Liberty
Financial. But the Asian stock collapse of the last year has put
the brakes on new business.
</P>
<P>
   Another big Liberty Financial unit, growth-stock manager Stein
Roe, attracted net sales last year. But sales have roughly equaled
redemptions in the first half of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always nice if you can buy something that's doing
phenomenally well at that second,'' said Leibler. ``But we are more
long-term investors. We are putting together investment
capabilities'' to carry the company through all types of investment
cycles.

   ISLAM-WEDDING_ NABLUS, West Bank _ Standing before a soccer
stadium packed with about 15,000 people, 35 men stand in black
suits holding red Korans and the green Islamic flag. They are young
Palestinian grooms, expressing what for many is a new attachment to
Islam in a public wedding celebration that glorifies the religion
and, indirectly, Hamas. One Hamas spokesman calls the young
believers the ``raw material'' for his movement. For the second
year, Islamic groups in this large West Bank city are reviving
their faith with a strong dose of politics and by helping young
couples navigate the complexities of Islamic courtship. These
weddings keep men and women guests separated, offer no alcohol or
hedonistic music and they're catching on. (Kaplow, Cox News

   PROBE-COSTS _ WASHINGTON _ Critics of independent counsel
Kenneth Starr say he has spent in excess of $40 million
investigating President Clinton. Starr's defenders say one of the
chief reasons for the expense is White House stall tactics,
including several costly court appeals. Regardless, Starr's
expenses are only part of the real cost, since dozens of government
lawyers have been pulled into the case on the White House side. And
that doesn't include the fees that witnesses have paid to
attorneys, estimated by one recent survey at $23 million. (Malone,
Cox News Service)

<P>
   CLINTON-REPORTERS _ WASHINGTON _ They slogged through Whitewater
despite a public that often preferred to hear less rather than more
about presidential scandal. They weathered the backlash of the
Clinton White House and sometimes faced resistance from fellow
reporters and their own publications. Now the handful of
journalists who have followed a trail of Clinton controversies for
six years are seeing their work lead to the first-ever appearance
by a president before a criminal grand jury. The persistence of
fewer than a dozen reporters has been largely responsible for
keeping the issue of Clinton's conduct before the country. ``The
heroes are the ones that have kept it alive,'' says Britt Hume, who
anchors an evening report on Washington for Fox Cable News. ``These
people have done tremendously well on this story, and it hasn't
been easy.'' Among them: Susan Schmidt of The Washington Post,
Newsweek's Mike Isikoff, Steve Labaton of The New York Times, Pete
Yost of the AP, as well as Jackie Judd and Chris Vlasto of ABC.

   US-ADULTERY _ WASHINGTON - Despite President Clinton's high
approval ratings in the face of allegations of marital infidelity,
a huge majority of Americans still believe adultery is wrong,
according to polling data. And adultery among the average American
couple is far less common than the flurry of recent allegations
against Clinton and other public figures would suggest, say
sociologists, marriage counselors and clergy. But in cases of
divorce, adultery plays a much larger role. (Shepard, Cox News
Service).

   CLINTON-NH-VOICES (Dover, N.H.) _ In 1992 Bill Clinton, his New
Hampshire primary campaign wounded by allegations of extra-marital
affairs and questions about his draft record, defied speculation
that he would have to drop out and instead, at the Elks hall here,
vowed to stick it out until ``the last dog dies.'' Voters rewarded
his perseverance with a second-place showing in this
first-in-the-nation primary, just enough to keep his candidacy
alive. Today, in that same Elks hall, with Clinton facing possibly
the most perilous moment of his presidency when he testifies before
a grand jury on Monday, club members and buyers at an antiques
auction voiced yet another chorus of defiant indifference to the
allegations against him. Pausing for emphasis, Bob Carroll, an

GOLF PILGRIMAGE GOES BEYOND LIFE'S WELL-MANICURED GREENS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN MARSHALL  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The cancer doctors' prognosis for the old man was grim: ``a
month, two at most.''
</P>
<P>
   It hardly seemed the most auspicious time to devote a couple
weeks to a golf pilgrimage, what with all the loose ends to tie up,
the goodbyes to say. But Braxton Dodson, pushing 80, and his son,
James, who was in his early 40s, still set off for the storied
courses of England and Scotland to play those places they had
always promised to do together but had never gotten around to
before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here are my terms,'' the father told his son. ``No complaints.
No long faces. We go to have laughs, hit a few balls, maybe take a
bit of the Queen's currency from each other's pockets. ... I've got
plenty of stuff to do. But I do want to pin your ears back for old
times' sake _ so you'll at least remember me.''
</P>
<P>
   But what happened in the following weeks would be remembered
long after Braxton Dodson's death, not only by James Dodson, but
also by thousands of strangers, all thanks to his remarkable little
memoir, ``Final Rounds: A Father, a Son, the Golf Journey of a
Lifetime'' (Bantam, 257 pages, $12.95).
</P>
<P>
   This is a haunting, bittersweet book that has been becoming a
word-of-mouth classic since its initial publication in 1996.
``Final Rounds'' is about golf, yes, the allure and lore of this
daunting game played across the enhanced landscape. But this memoir
is more about the difficult terrain that must be traversed by all
fathers and sons, that place of longings and expectations and
often-harsher realities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Final Rounds'' does for fathers and sons and golf what ``Field
of Dreams'' did for fathers and sons and baseball, which is no
accident. These two contemplative sports (along with fly-fishing)
have long produced the most compelling literature of any athletic
endeavors.
</P>
<P>
   James Dodson, a former political reporter turned golf writer,
has a deft putter's touch with emotion-laden material that, in less
sure hands, could have been maudlin. Much of his success must be
traced to the resilient character of his father, whom he once
disparaged with a nickname (Opti the Mystic) because of his
boundless optimism.
</P>
<P>
   Braxton Dodson, who had not walked a golf course in years, treks
across the hillocks and dales of courses in Britain, never once
complaining about the ravages of his advancing illness, his
deteriorating eyesight and hearing or the major inconveniences
caused by a radical colostomy a decade before. Opti the Mystic
turns out to be a true Southern gentleman and real trouper, too, an
entirely admirable and wise man in the most trying of
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing life really promises us is pain,'' the father
tells son, at one point. ``It's up to us to create the joy.''
</P>
<P>
   The two Dodsons do play golf on their pilgrimage, with the
spirited mix of competitiveness and kidding that they had brought
to two decades of playing together on their home course in North
Carolina and courses far beyond.
</P>
<P>
   But what their last golf pilgrimage really provides is a chance
to ask questions unasked or share insights unshared while there is
still a little time left, a precious opportunity that probably far
too few fathers and sons ever get to experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Final Rounds'' has prompted all sorts of surprises that James
Dodson never imagined for his first book _ rhapsodic reviews by
critics; sales of more than the 170,000 copies (including 60,000
copies purchased by one golf club in Arizona); a planned film; even
a contract to co-write the memoirs of legend Arnold Palmer (a great
admirer of ``Final Rounds''). Dodson has recently published another
pilgrimage story, ``Faithful Travelers'' (Bantam, 279 pages,
$22.95), about a fly-fishing odyssey with his 7-year-old daughter.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing that occurred in the aftermath of ``Final Rounds''
has affected Dodson quite like what he has heard from more than 30
other men.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have called or written to say that they have taken their
fathers on golf journeys, too,'' Dodson, 45, said this week from
his home in Maine. ``What I really care about, what means the most
to me, is they say that the book touched them so much that these
fathers and sons took a golf trip together like we did.''

LAWN JOCKEYS, BACK IN STYLE, HAVE IMPORTANT HISTORIC MEANING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Aug. 16)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By FRANCES INGRAHAM  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Jockeys aren't just at the racetrack. Replicas of
uniformed jockeys can also be found on residential lawns, where
they are most commonly featured holding a decorative or working
lantern to light the way, or a ring, which could be used to tether
a horse.
</P>
<P>
   Cast-iron and concrete jockeys have been a common sight in just
about any area that has a racetrack and on thoroughbred farms,
where they are often painted in the colors that the stable races
under.
</P>
<P>
   Black-faced lawn jockeys were used beginning in the 1800s. They
fell out of favor in the 1960s with the civil rights movement, when
many owners began to paint the exposed faces and hands of their
lawn jockeys white.
</P>
<P>
   Lawn jockeys have remained a constant staple in horse catalogs,
antiques shops and most lawn-sculpture centers. Concrete law
jockeys also can be found.
</P>
<P>
   The Impressions of Saratoga Springs catalog listed weatherproof,
cast-aluminum lawn jockeys with customized colors, measuring 43
inches tall with a 13-inch base, selling for $650.
</P>
<P>
   Vintage cast-iron lawn jockeys with original black face are
valued at approximately $1,000 to $1,500, according to Terry Kovel
of Kovel's Antiques Buyer Guide.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond being decorative, lawn jockeys with (original) black
faces were originally used as house markers on the Underground
Railroad prior to the Civil War. This was a secret network of
blacks and whites who helped black slaves flee to freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Those who chose to aid the slaves would tie a green ribbon to
one of the arms of the black jockey, to signify it was safe to
enter a house, and not to stop if the ribbon was red. In lieu of
ribbons, some households placed an American flag in the hand of the
jockey as an indication that it was safe to enter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every county in New York state was involved with the
Underground Railroad,'' Charles Blockson, curator of the
Afro-American Collection at Temple University in Philadelphia and
published authority on the Underground Railroad, said in a recent
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Lawn jockeys were also known as ``Jockos.'' This folklore tale
dates back to a young boy named Jocko, who held George Washington's
horse on shore at the crossing of the Delaware and froze to death
in the process. Because of the boy's dedication, Washington had a
statue made of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the years, the little boy's image changed to a groomsman
in the Old South and eventually evolving into that of a jockey. The
statue became a national figure after World War II,'' Blockson
said.
</P>
<P>
   He said not all black-faced jockeys should be seen as demeaning,
contrary to views held by some.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's not a stereotypical image of a black _ where the
`Jocko' is dressed as a black-faced minstrel, with big white eyes
or other negative images _ the statue stands as a positive reminder
of the Underground Railroad and the good deeds of helping to
abolish slavery,'' Blockson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep a 5-foot-tall, 400-pound cast-iron black groomsman with
a lantern in hand from the 1800s at the entrance to the lobby of
Sullivan Hall on campus, where our collection is housed. People who
see it for the first time often don't know how to respond. That is
until they read the caption at the bottom: `Lawn Jockey, original
statue with light, which served as a symbol of safety on the
Underground Railroad.'''
</P>
<P>
   Lawn ornaments, including lawn jockeys, are experiencing a
popular resurgence that have made them targets for theft, so be
sure they are bolted down or imbedded in cement.

`THE SONG OF THE RIVER' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for all needing)   (For use by Hearst Newspapers)  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Hearst Newspapers are commemorating the 47th
anniversary of the death of William Randolph Hearst. Along with
numerous other writings, he penned this poem, a favorite of us in
the Hearst organization. Reprinting the poem is our traditional
method of remembering our founder on each anniversary of his death
Aug. 14, 1951.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Song of the River''
</P>
<P>
   The snow melts on the mountain
</P>
<P>
   And the water runs down to the spring,
</P>
<P>
   And the spring in a turbulent fountain,
</P>
<P>
   With a song of youth to sing,
</P>
<P>
   Runs down to the riotous river,
</P>
<P>
   And the river flows to the sea,
</P>
<P>
   And the water again
</P>
<P>
   Goes back in rain
</P>
<P>
   To the hills where it used to be.
</P>
<P>
   And I wonder if life's deep mystery
</P>
<P>
   Isn't much like the rain and the snow
</P>
<P>
   Returning through all eternity
</P>
<P>
   To the places it used to know.
</P>
<P>
   For life was born on the lofty heights
</P>
<P>
   And flows in a laughing stream,
</P>
<P>
   To the river below
</P>
<P>
   Whose onward flow
</P>
<P>
   Ends in a peaceful dream.
</P>
<P>
   And so at last,
</P>
<P>
   When our life has passed
</P>
<P>
   And the river has run its course,
</P>
<P>
   It again goes back,
</P>
<P>
   O'er the selfsame track,
</P>
<P>
   To the mountain which was its source.
</P>
<P>
   So why prize life
</P>
<P>
   Or why fear death,
</P>
<P>
   Or dread what is to be?
</P>
<P>
   The river ran
</P>
<P>
   Its allotted span

<TEXT>
<P>
   Who did it?
</P>
<P>
   The usual Islamist suspects are being laid out for inspection.
Since some of these ``suspects'' are truly suspect, they could well
include the criminal mind or minds behind the twin car bomb
explosions at the American embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam
which on Aug. 7 killed more than 200 people, including 12
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   But for the moment _ which could turn out to be quite a long
moment, as the United States embarks on arduous investigations _
their identity, arrests in Tanzania and sightings in Kenya
notwithstanding, is speculation only.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the message the terrorists delivered, unsigned and amorphous
though it was, is unmistakable: they set out to hurt America and
Americans, although the result was mainly to kill Africans.
</P>
<P>
   This strengthens the general supposition that the guilty
individuals have some Islamist or Middle Eastern connection _ with
the rider that nobody should forget the false leap to Islamist
judgment after the Oklahoma bombing in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   East Africa is unaccustomed to this particular form of violence.
Although there are sub-Saharan Africans who hold strong grudges
against America (Somalis, for instance, in whose country America
carried out a clumsy intervention, or Rwandans, whose rescue it
stood back from), it seems improbable that such people would be
prepared or equipped to exact so coordinated a revenge.
</P>
<P>
   Sudan, where America has been trying, through Sudan's African
neighbors, to undermine the Islamist regime, links Africa to the
Middle East. In a Middle Eastern context, this kind of terrorism is
slightly less baffling _ and certainly less uncommon.
</P>
<P>
   America is by no means the only victim of international terror,
but it is a particularly attractive target for a new sort of
anti-West, anti-everything terrorist group, which typically lacks a
clear agenda but harbors a deep grudge.
</P>
<P>
   It is also, however, a butt for grudge-bearers with an agenda,
especially in the Middle East. And it is here that it has from time
to time _ in the past in Lebanon, recently in Saudi Arabia _ been
an outstanding target for terrorist attack.
</P>
<P>
   Why should Middle Easterners be suspected of bearing hostility
to the United States so bitter that it encompasses mass,
indiscriminate murder?
</P>
<P>
   America, after all, has done much for the region. It led a
coalition of forces to drive Iraq out of the Arab country it had
occupied, it keeps some 35,000 servicemen in and around the Gulf to
protect weak, wealthy states from predatory neighbors, it has
toiled assiduously to further peace between Israel and the Arabs,
it offers a way of life that most find enviable.
</P>
<P>
   Good things, all of them, to have done or to have. Yet all can
be, and frequently are, turned against the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The mirror image of the credits look like debits to many Arabs.
America, these critics argue, has ruthlessly pursued a personal
vendetta against Iraq's Saddam Hussein, the presence of its troops
on Arab land has become an offense to their hosts, it has been
jelly-soft with Israel, its liberal culture corrupts devout
Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   Familiar accusations, often trotted out, and surely no murdering
matter. There is more to it.
</P>
<P>
   America's vulnerability is an adjunct of its peculiar strength.
As sole surviving superpower, without benefit of false modesty, it
stands out distinctly from the crowd, a potential target for
snipers.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes America discreetly masks its preeminence in collective
action. Sometimes it chooses to push ahead on its own, not hanging
around to gather a consensus from fellow members of the U.N.
Security Council or from the European Union. It boldly takes the
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Its trouble, particularly on Middle Eastern issues, is that it
often remains alone.
</P>
<P>
   Disagreements between America and its allies on Middle Eastern
issues tend to be crudely interpreted in the region. The result, in
Arab and Iranian ledgers, is that the United States is entered on
the ``wrong'' side, most of the rest of the world on the ``right.''
</P>
<P>
   On Iran, for instance, America has pursued a much harsher line
than other westerners (and remains the Great Satan to hard-line
Iranians who, involved in political civil war with their own
government, are at least as determined as some Americans that the
inter-state hostility should persist).
</P>
<P>
   On Iraq, America, with virtually only Britain in full support,
has refused to countenance the idea that the time is coming to
remove sanctions which are torturing a people but have so far left
the ruling regime untouched.
</P>
<P>
   In Egypt, America has exerted itself to help the authorities
catch Islamist militants, apparently aiding in the extradition of
fugitives.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, America's diffidence towards the Israeli government
contrasts with almost everybody else's impatience at Israeli
obduracy _ and with its own rigor towards the states it regards as
``pariahs'': Iran, Iraq, Syria and Libya.
</P>
<P>
   Being out of step on Middle Eastern issues is not the same as
being wrong: it can be vigorously argued, and often is, that
America's line is the right one and that others, sometimes guided
by a narrower self-interest, are at fault for not following
America's lead.
</P>
<P>
   True, that lead may well lead nowhere but this, its advocates
would say, does not necessarily invalidate the argument: if America
had had more support, its policies would have had a better chance
of working, and America itself would have been less exposed.

<P>
   Terrorism, if you cannot do anything about it, is a powerful
disincentive. America's temptation to withdraw into an isolationist
shell could be compelling.
</P>
<P>
   For a start, it would please a great many Americans who see
little point in enduring the grief that comes with a busy foreign
policy. So far this retreat has not taken place, despite the
shrinking of official appetite for foreign activism since the
Somalia mess in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the truck bomb that killed 19 American servicemen
in Dhahran in 1996 was an anonymous bloodstained order to the
Americans to take their 5,000 or so troops out of Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton did not do so _ though the troops were
tactfully withdrawn to an air base deep in the desert, where their
presence, particularly that of women soldiers, is less alarming to
Islamist sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   Of course all governments have the right to make up their own
minds; they certainly should not be sheep to America's shepherd.
Collective action, nearly always preferable to the unilateral
version, should entail America deferring to its allies as well as
the allies deferring to America.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, with all that said, the world can still be mightily
relieved that its richest and most powerful nation is prepared,
despite adverse consequences to itself, to take a lead.
</P>
<P>
   Muddling a way through the maze that still persists long after
the end of the Cold War, dithery countries need someone or
something out front. The greatest disaster would be for terrorist
bombs to create an isolationist or cowering America. &QL;

<P>
   Who did it?
</P>
<P>
   The usual Islamist suspects are being laid out for inspection.
Since some of these ``suspects'' are truly suspect, they could well
include the criminal mind or minds behind the twin car bomb
explosions at the American embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam
which on Aug. 7 killed more than 200 people, including 12
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   But for the moment _ which could turn out to be quite a long
moment, as the United States embarks on arduous investigations _
their identity, arrests in Tanzania and sightings in Kenya
notwithstanding, is speculation only.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the message the terrorists delivered, unsigned and amorphous
though it was, is unmistakable: they set out to hurt America and
Americans, although the result was mainly to kill Africans.
</P>
<P>
   This strengthens the general supposition that the guilty
individuals have some Islamist or Middle Eastern connection _ with
the rider that nobody should forget the false leap to Islamist
judgment after the Oklahoma bombing in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   East Africa is unaccustomed to this particular form of violence.
Although there are sub-Saharan Africans who hold strong grudges
against America (Somalis, for instance, in whose country America
carried out a clumsy intervention, or Rwandans, whose rescue it
stood back from), it seems improbable that such people would be
prepared or equipped to exact so coordinated a revenge.
</P>
<P>
   Sudan, where America has been trying, through Sudan's African
neighbors, to undermine the Islamist regime, links Africa to the
Middle East. In a Middle Eastern context, this kind of terrorism is
slightly less baffling _ and certainly less uncommon.
</P>
<P>
   America is by no means the only victim of international terror,
but it is a particularly attractive target for a new sort of
anti-West, anti-everything terrorist group, which typically lacks a
clear agenda but harbors a deep grudge.
</P>
<P>
   It is also, however, a butt for grudge-bearers with an agenda,
especially in the Middle East. And it is here that it has from time
to time _ in the past in Lebanon, recently in Saudi Arabia _ been
an outstanding target for terrorist attack.
</P>
<P>
   Why should Middle Easterners be suspected of bearing hostility
to the United States so bitter that it encompasses mass,
indiscriminate murder?
</P>
<P>
   America, after all, has done much for the region. It led a
coalition of forces to drive Iraq out of the Arab country it had
occupied, it keeps some 35,000 servicemen in and around the Gulf to
protect weak, wealthy states from predatory neighbors, it has
toiled assiduously to further peace between Israel and the Arabs,
it offers a way of life that most find enviable.
</P>
<P>
   Good things, all of them, to have done or to have. Yet all can
be, and frequently are, turned against the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The mirror image of the credits look like debits to many Arabs.
America, these critics argue, has ruthlessly pursued a personal
vendetta against Iraq's Saddam Hussein, the presence of its troops
on Arab land has become an offense to their hosts, it has been
jelly-soft with Israel, its liberal culture corrupts devout
Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   Familiar accusations, often trotted out, and surely no murdering
matter. There is more to it.
</P>
<P>
   America's vulnerability is an adjunct of its peculiar strength.
As sole surviving superpower, without benefit of false modesty, it
stands out distinctly from the crowd, a potential target for
snipers.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes America discreetly masks its preeminence in collective
action. Sometimes it chooses to push ahead on its own, not hanging
around to gather a consensus from fellow members of the U.N.
Security Council or from the European Union. It boldly takes the
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Its trouble, particularly on Middle Eastern issues, is that it
often remains alone.
</P>
<P>
   Disagreements between America and its allies on Middle Eastern
issues tend to be crudely interpreted in the region. The result, in
Arab and Iranian ledgers, is that the United States is entered on
the ``wrong'' side, most of the rest of the world on the ``right.''
</P>
<P>
   On Iran, for instance, America has pursued a much harsher line
than other westerners (and remains the Great Satan to hard-line
Iranians who, involved in political civil war with their own
government, are at least as determined as some Americans that the
inter-state hostility should persist).
</P>
<P>
   On Iraq, America, with virtually only Britain in full support,
has refused to countenance the idea that the time is coming to
remove sanctions which are torturing a people but have so far left
the ruling regime untouched.
</P>
<P>
   In Egypt, America has exerted itself to help the authorities
catch Islamist militants, apparently aiding in the extradition of
fugitives.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, America's diffidence towards the Israeli government
contrasts with almost everybody else's impatience at Israeli
obduracy _ and with its own rigor towards the states it regards as

<P>
   Many a patriotic Englishman would no doubt this week be tempted
to urge the queen to dub Sir Darren Gough or ennoble Lord Fraser of
Stout Bowling, to mark the astonishing fact that England has at
last won a top international cricket series.
</P>
<P>
   Such titles would at least have the merit of clarity: everyone
would know, at least while the memory lasted, why they had been
granted and what they signified. That is more than can be said for
most _ perhaps all _ of Britain's plethora of faux-aristocratic
titles.
</P>
<P>
   Who can say what Sir Reggie Bloggins actually did to get his
gong, or whether Lady Rhubarb is so-called on her own merit or that
of her husband's checkbook, or what the difference is between a
Viscount Bogtrotter and a Marquess of Bidet?
</P>
<P>
   There is a case for all this. Partly, it is a quaint British
reminder of its feudal history, partly, perhaps, a fairly cheap
system of incentives and rewards for political and public service
that may help restrain the nastier forms of corruption.
</P>
<P>
   It also provides pleasure to recipients and their relatives,
ample cause for gossip for others, and a source of pride to the
three people alive who know what all the titles mean.
</P>
<P>
   Yet that is where the problem lies. Apart from an admirable
fondness for history and tradition, other qualities commonly
associated with Britons include understatement and an instinct for
clarity rather than obfuscation.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, although attempts have been made to retire some
knightly orders and to hand out awards for merit rather than
timeserving, the mishmash of British titles suggests a rather
vulgar boastfulness while being almost wholly bewildering.
</P>
<P>
   Into this bewilderment has strode a voice of more-or-less
clarity, an ennobled one, no less.
</P>
<P>
   Baroness Jay, a life peer who has just been made leader of the
House of Lords, floated in an interview with the Daily Telegraph
the idea that once hereditary peers have been stripped of their
voting rights in the upper house, as Labour plans, the remaining
voting (i.e., life) peers should lose their titles and simply
attach ML, meaning member of the Lords, to their names.
</P>
<P>
   This idea is welcome, as far as it goes. Admittedly, it would
leave the top titles as exclusively a feudal relic rather than
sometimes a badge of actual distinction.
</P>
<P>
   But as the point of a title should be to convey some information
to others, saving them from embarrassment or hours of research,
this would be something of an improvement.
</P>
<P>
   On meeting Lord This or Baron That you would at least know they
were not a political has-been or a businessman being lured into
government, but rather that at some point in a past century they
had a notable ancestor, that it is best not to ask after their sons
or daughters because you will surely get those titles wrong, and
that they can probably afford to pay for dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it leaves many questions unanswered. How can you be a member
of the House of Lords if you are not a lord and if all the real
ones are excluded? This de-nobled house will need a new, suitably
clear, name.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are all those sirs, ladies and dames. The
quickest way to restore British modesty and clarity would be to
abolish the lot.
</P>
<P>
   But if British incrementalism wins out, a compromise could be to
scrap the titles but restrict the users to the sets of initials
which already come attached to the titles (indicating chivalric
orders, if you must know). The GCMGs, KCVOs and DCBs would still be
bewildering, but at least they wouldn't get in the way. &QL;

<P>
   Many a patriotic Englishman would no doubt this week be tempted
to urge the queen to dub Sir Darren Gough or ennoble Lord Fraser of
Stout Bowling, to mark the astonishing fact that England has at
last won a top international cricket series.
</P>
<P>
   Such titles would at least have the merit of clarity: everyone
would know, at least while the memory lasted, why they had been
granted and what they signified. That is more than can be said for
most _ perhaps all _ of Britain's plethora of faux-aristocratic
titles.
</P>
<P>
   Who can say what Sir Reggie Bloggins actually did to get his
gong, or whether Lady Rhubarb is so-called on her own merit or that
of her husband's checkbook, or what the difference is between a
Viscount Bogtrotter and a Marquess of Bidet?
</P>
<P>
   There is a case for all this. Partly, it is a quaint British
reminder of its feudal history, partly, perhaps, a fairly cheap
system of incentives and rewards for political and public service
that may help restrain the nastier forms of corruption.
</P>
<P>
   It also provides pleasure to recipients and their relatives,
ample cause for gossip for others, and a source of pride to the
three people alive who know what all the titles mean.
</P>
<P>
   Yet that is where the problem lies. Apart from an admirable
fondness for history and tradition, other qualities commonly
associated with Britons include understatement and an instinct for
clarity rather than obfuscation.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, although attempts have been made to retire some
knightly orders and to hand out awards for merit rather than
timeserving, the mishmash of British titles suggests a rather
vulgar boastfulness while being almost wholly bewildering.
</P>
<P>
   Into this bewilderment has strode a voice of more-or-less
clarity, an ennobled one, no less.
</P>
<P>
   Baroness Jay, a life peer who has just been made leader of the
House of Lords, floated in an interview with the Daily Telegraph
the idea that once hereditary peers have been stripped of their
voting rights in the upper house, as Labour plans, the remaining
voting (i.e., life) peers should lose their titles and simply
attach ML, meaning member of the Lords, to their names.
</P>
<P>
   This idea is welcome, as far as it goes. Admittedly, it would
leave the top titles as exclusively a feudal relic rather than
sometimes a badge of actual distinction.
</P>
<P>
   But as the point of a title should be to convey some information
to others, saving them from embarrassment or hours of research,
this would be something of an improvement.
</P>
<P>
   On meeting Lord This or Baron That you would at least know they
were not a political has-been or a businessman being lured into
government, but rather that at some point in a past century they
had a notable ancestor, that it is best not to ask after their sons
or daughters because you will surely get those titles wrong, and
that they can probably afford to pay for dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it leaves many questions unanswered. How can you be a member
of the House of Lords if you are not a lord and if all the real
ones are excluded? This de-nobled house will need a new, suitably
clear, name.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are all those sirs, ladies and dames. The
quickest way to restore British modesty and clarity would be to
abolish the lot.
</P>
<P>
   But if British incrementalism wins out, a compromise could be to
scrap the titles but restrict the users to the sets of initials
which already come attached to the titles (indicating chivalric
orders, if you must know). The GCMGs, KCVOs and DCBs would still be
bewildering, but at least they wouldn't get in the way. &QL;

 (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The story of Madeleine Albright is enough to make a strong heart
gloomy.
</P>
<P>
   When she became U.S. secretary of state 18 months ago, things
seemed splendid. She was the first woman in the job; she had an
appealing personal story, as a childhood refugee from Hitler and
Stalin; she exuded the charm and fluency so important in the age of
television.
</P>
<P>
   She had more star power than any secretary of state since Henry
Kissinger, a fact especially noticeable because she succeeded
plodding Warren Christopher.
</P>
<P>
   Yet these days almost nobody speaks well of her. And this raises
painful questions about America's capacity for leadership.
</P>
<P>
   People said that Mrs. Albright's charm would invigorate foreign
policy. She knew how to get the rest of the administration on her
side. She knew how to persuade voters not to be bored by abroad.
She knew how to coax the chivalrous Southerner out of Jesse Helms,
the usually cantankerous chairman of the Senate foreign-relations
committee.
</P>
<P>
   And she sounded bold. She described America as the
``indispensable nation.'' She said her mindset was formed by Munich
rather than Vietnam, meaning that she would not shrink from using
force against tyranny.
</P>
<P>
   Early last year, Mrs. Albright's clout within the administration
helped to keep America engaged in Bosnia. But then her clout seemed
to wane.
</P>
<P>
   In May she delivered an ultimatum to Israel: cooperate on a new
peace plan, or America will be rough on you. Israel refused to
cooperate, but Clinton refused to get rough: Mrs. Albright seemed
to have less leverage at the White House than Israel's lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   As if to underline this point, the president recently appointed
her rival, Richard Holbrooke, as ambassador to the United Nations:
the word is that the secretary of state was informed rather than
consulted about this.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Albright's reputation for connecting with Middle America
has faded, too. In February, in a college gymnasium in Ohio, she
and two other top administration officials made the case for
containing Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   They failed to win over their audience, and this debacle helps
to explain why America's response to Iraq's current defiance of
U.N. sanctions has so far been mushy.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Albright's courtship of Helms has also delivered less than
had been hoped. It eased the passage of NATO enlargement in the
Senate, and helped get the chemical-weapons treaty through: both
considerable achievements. But Congress still refuses to pay
America's past U.N. dues, and jerks its knee at administration
policies from freeing trade to engaging China.
</P>
<P>
   Because Mrs. Albright has not always won the backing of the
president, voters and Congress, she has failed to deliver on her
bold rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   She promised a Munich mind-set; but NATO still shrinks from
deterring Serbian attacks on Kosovo. She promised that the
indispensable nation would make its influence felt; but Israel has
shown it can dispense with her advice quite cheerfully.
</P>
<P>
   Now, when Mrs. Albright promises that the terrorists who blew up
American embassies in Africa will be found and punished,
Washington's commentariat raises its eyebrows.
</P>
<P>
   What to make of this humiliation? Some say it shows that charm
and sound bites are no substitute for geopolitical grasp, or
(depending on the critic's point of view) for attention to detail.
</P>
<P>
   This is unfair. Mrs. Albright, a former academic, grasps
geopolitics as well as the next wonk; and she has deputies to worry
about detail.
</P>
<P>
   Others suggest that Mrs. Albright has been undermined by a
president who thinks about scandals more than foreign policy. But
Clinton has actually made foreign policy a feature of his second
term, so this is not the whole answer.
</P>
<P>
   The better explanation for Mrs. Albright's comedown lies not in
scandals or in her personal failings, but in the nature of her job.
Hence the painful possibility that whoever comes next will also
have trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Since the end of the Cold War, America's foreign ministers have
been in a bind. If they speak in vague and cautious tones, their
countrymen will be confirmed in their suspicion that foreign policy
is a hopeless muddle and may anyway no longer matter.
</P>
<P>
   This is what happened in Clinton's first term: Christopher was
grey, so Congress slashed the foreign-policy budget and other bits
of the administration grabbed juicy issues (Japan policy was run
first by the trade negotiators and then by the Pentagon).
</P>
<P>
   If foreign ministers speak boldly, on the other hand, they may
fall into Mrs. Albright's trap. They will command admiring
attention for a while. But they may fail to deliver on their bold
words, in which case humiliation will follow.
</P>
<P>
   This, of course, is a general problem of America's divided
government: each power center is tempted to proclaim a vision in
order to stay ahead of its rivals, but at the same time the
division of power tends to block the action needed to deliver on
the vision.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the problem is especially acute in foreign policy. For one
thing, the temptation to proclaim vision is uncommonly powerful:
you can get away with vision-free steadiness on transport policy,
but if you propose to risk soldiers' lives you need a
grand-sounding reason.
</P>
<P>
   For another, the task of living up to a vision is uncommonly
tough. Unlike roads, the myriad trouble spots of the post-Cold-War
world do not lie quietly there while you wonder how to fix them.
</P>
<P>
   Does this mean that the predicament of America's secretary of
state is hopeless? No: just difficult. It is possible, after all,
to imagine a set of conditions under which Mrs. Albright might have
fared better.
</P>
<P>
   If she had enjoyed a stronger personal relationship with
Clinton, she might have avoided the boomerang ultimatum to Israel.
If she had chosen a friendlier setting than a gym full of students,
she might have avoided the public relations debacle on what to do
about Saddam Hussein. If Clinton had been undistracted by scandal,
he might have backed her more vigorously in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the next secretary of state will succeed famously;
perhaps this one, as she probably deserves, will recover from her
woes. Alas, the odds are daunting. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Amid the grime and misery of Baghdad, it is a strange sight: a
brand-new bright green shop front, full of sleek Italian clothes
and posters of wide-eyed African and Asian faces.
</P>
<P>
   As idle taxi drivers and peanut hawkers look on in envy, a
handful of well-to-do Iraqis rummage through racks of linen suits,
pick over piles of plaid shirts and try on designer jeans.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the devastation left by the Gulf war and the war with
Iran, and the economic paralysis that has been brought on by United
Nations sanctions, Benetton has made it to Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   The man who brought it there is also an unexpected sight.
Slight, short and shy, Ahmad Samha does not look like a daredevil
entrepreneur. In fact, it is hard to imagine how he manages to do
any business at all.
</P>
<P>
   In just three years and in the teeth of fearsome bureaucracy,
corruption and an instinctive suspicion of private enterprise, he
has built up a chain of 32 stores in Syria, all of which are
supplied from his own modern factory.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. embargo notwithstanding, Samha has managed to expand
into Iraq. By the end of the year he plans to open his first outlet
in Algeria. Iran is next on the list.
</P>
<P>
   Syria is not obviously a land of opportunity. It is
internationally isolated and economically troubled. Garment imports
are banned; and few foreign companies are interested in its small,
unstable market _ even though, thanks to a recent opening to
outside investment, foreign firms can set up joint ventures with
Syrian partners.
</P>
<P>
   If they bother with Syria at all, they tend to sell franchises
to local businessmen. Such is the deal that Benetton has done with
Samha, even though its international outlets normally sell only
stuff made in its Italian factories.
</P>
<P>
   Syria's state-controlled banks do not lend to entrepreneurs.
Private banks do not exist. So finding the money to start a
business is a struggle. Private companies labor under murky and
sometimes contradictory regulations designed to leave them
vulnerable to governmental whim.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, almost every successful businessman in Syria is
related, or at least closely connected, to a senior government
figure. Local partners or franchise-holders of foreign firms are
typically middlemen who oil cogs and grease palms so that the
outsiders can get on with selling their goods.
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty of doing business in Syria is Samha's challenge;
but it is also his opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Rogue states have rich people too, and rich people long for
foreign fashions. Fraught trade relations and off-putting
investment climates (to say the least) normally prevent them from
getting hold of the fancy imported goods they covet; which only
sharpens the desire.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, preferential trade agreements between Syria and other
Middle Eastern countries closed to western imports provide Samha's
company, Amal Samha, with a wide and sheltered market.
</P>
<P>
   Samha did not start with the political connections more usual
among successful businessmen. His father is not a minister, but a
carpenter. And he is a clothes maker, not a fixer.
</P>
<P>
   By the age of 11, he had already settled on his future career
when he took an after-school job at a tailor's. In 1977, aged 15,
he dropped out of school to work full-time on the four sewing
machines he had bought with his savings. (He still speaks only
Arabic.)
</P>
<P>
   By the time Benetton came to Syria to scout for a franchisee in
the mid-1990s, Samha owned a factory exporting clothes to Europe.
He knew the local shopkeepers, so was able to accelerate Benetton's
expansion in Syria by signing sub-franchises for individual stores.
With his own factory already running, it proved relatively easy to
set up the Benetton lines.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike his counterparts in Syria, who keep fingers in as many
pies as possible to spread the risk and distract the taxman, Samha
puts all his energy and earnings into a single trade.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a revolution in local retailing. Never before have
Syrians or Iraqis seen a chain of stores selling clothes of uniform
quality at fixed prices.
</P>
<P>
   The bright, clean, spacious shops, which are all designed to
Benetton's specifications, delight customers used to cluttered,
dimly-lit bazaars. The posters from Benetton's international
advertising campaigns, which concentrate on attractive foreign
faces rather than the company's clothes, shine out on the streets
of Aleppo and Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   Few local firms spend anything like the 5 percent of turnover
stipulated by Benetton on advertising. Amal _ the Arabic for hope _
is introducing the concept of a brand for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   But western marketing techniques carry risks. The Syrian
authorities hate the idea of western consumerism conquering their
semi-socialist society.
</P>
<P>
   They recently forced Damascus's first KFC outlet, which boasted
of its chicken from Kentucky, to change to something that smacked
less of cultural imperialism.
</P>
<P>
   The new Kuwaiti Food Company (still KFC) is also having trouble
competing with the city's countless roast-chicken stands, despite
fancy advertising and clean counters.
</P>
<P>
   For the time being, Amal has kept a low enough profile to avoid
unwanted attention from the authorities. Its prices are just high
enough to seem exclusive without being prohibitive.
</P>
<P>
   But Samha is stuck in a tight corner. As it is, he believes he
has saturated the Syrian market. His two stores in Baghdad are
patronized only by the tiny government elite that can still afford
such frivolities.
</P>
<P>
   After Iran, he will even have run out of rogue states
(Benetton's Egyptian franchisee has snapped up Libya).
</P>
<P>
   As long as the countries where Samha sells his clothes remain
politically unpredictable and economically stagnant, his potential
customer base will never expand much. But if they reform, they will
attract competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Samha may have found a niche, but it will never be a comfortable
one. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON AND NEW YORK _ Dismissively, John D. Rockefeller once
referred to the early days of the American oil industry as
``harvest time'': anybody could get rich simply by digging a hole
in the ground.
</P>
<P>
   His generation, he maintained, lived through harsher times, and
got rich through their organizational flair, or not at all. He
turned his genius to consolidation, and it made him very rich
indeed.
</P>
<P>
   With the price of Brent Crude at its lowest level in real terms
for 25 years, harsh times are here again _ and so, it appears, is
the Rockefeller vision.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest industrial merger ever, between British Petroleum
and Amoco, may herald a new era of consolidation in an industry
where mergers have been scarce of late.
</P>
<P>
   BP, whose American wing is based around the Ohio part of
Rockefeller's Standard Oil empire, is paying $48 billion to acquire
Amoco, which was created from Standard Oil of Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   Although this represents a steepish 15 percent premium over
Amoco's pre-bid value, the merger has been applauded as a good fit:
BP is generally better at the upstream part of the business
(finding and extracting oil); Amoco at the downstream business of
refining, distributing and marketing the stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Amoco's stronghold is the United States _ hitherto a weak spot
for BP. And the Chicago-based firm beefs up BP's gas and
petrochemicals divisions.
</P>
<P>
   As these empires are meshed together, there should be plenty of
savings. Sir John Browne, BP's boss, who will also head the new
company, has a flair for cutting costs that Rockefeller might have
appreciated: BP's work force now has fewer than half the 112,000
people it had in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Some 6,000 of the 99,000 jobs at the new BP Amoco are already
earmarked to go; managers' bonuses will be tied to producing $2
billion in annual pre-tax savings by the end of 2000. Businesses
that are not number one or two in their segments are likely to be
sold.
</P>
<P>
   All the same, Sir John promises much more than mere
cost-cutting. He describes both BP and Amoco as being ``at the top
of the second division.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal will put the new BP Amoco in a first division of
``super majors,'' alongside Exxon and Royal Dutch/Shell. The new
firm will on some counts be these firms' equal: it will, for
instance, have more oil and gas reserves than Exxon.
</P>
<P>
   More important, the merger puts BP in a different league from
all the other companies in the business.
</P>
<P>
   As a competitive tactic, this has already worked well. The oil
industry is now abuzz with gossip about further consolidation
involving BP's former peers, such as Chevron, Mobil and Texaco.
</P>
<P>
   BP's bosses even speculate that the news may have caused a
frisson of pain in Shell House, where its old enemy had been
concentrating on overtaking Exxon.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the question of whether the oil industry is charging in the
right direction remains unanswered.
</P>
<P>
   With stocks of oil at record levels, demand depressed in Asia,
and members of the OPEC oil cartel always ready to cheat on their
quotas, there is little hope of a dramatic rise in the oil price in
the near future.
</P>
<P>
   Having been hustled out of the Middle East long ago, all the
majors are heavily dependent on giant fields that were discovered
decades ago, many of which (particularly those in North America and
Europe) are starting to decline.
</P>
<P>
   The great task for today's oil firms is to replace these ``crown
jewels.'' In recent years a mere handful of fields containing more
than 500 million barrels have been discovered, in contrast with
dozens of big new discoveries in previous decades.
</P>
<P>
   Deep-water reserves, such as those in the Gulf of Mexico and off
the coast of West Africa, are expensive to extract. Russia, which
sits on 5 percent of the world's proven oil reserves, is prickly.
</P>
<P>
   Last year BP took a 10 percent stake in Russia's Sidanco; it
recently reported a $20 million loss due to problems there.
</P>
<P>
   The Caspian, where both BP and Amoco have struck deals, is stuck
in a tortuous geopolitical argument over the route of pipelines
from the area.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly there is natural gas: demand for the stuff is growing
more rapidly than demand for oil, in part because burning it
produces less pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Amoco has large reserves of gas. In 1988 it bought Dome
Petroleum, a Canadian gas firm, for $4.2 billion. But transporting
gas is difficult and it has no international spot market, forcing
producers to find long-term buyers before any big investment in a
gas field, which can be a long process.
</P>
<P>
   BP thinks the merger will help it deal with these difficulties.
Simply by having a broader range of countries, it should be less
vulnerable than most to upsets in any one place: Shell's problems
in Nigeria made only a small dent in its performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your appetite for risk is a function of how much capital you
have,'' one senior figure stresses. ``Now we can afford to make
bigger bets.''
</P>
<P>
   Both BP and Amoco have often had to go into partnership on big
oil deals; now they can bid alone.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a growing tendency by governments to demand that
oil companies do more than just extract oil; they have to build
infrastructure as well _ once again pushing up the cost.
</P>
<P>
   BP and Amoco also say that they will reconsider the liquefied
natural gas industry that they have shied away from in the past. &QL;

</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   In all this, Sir John is careful to talk about size being an
``outcome, not an aim'' and stresses his willingness to sell
businesses as well as enter them. He is adamant, however, that
scale does matter in some areas _ and even in the fashionable
business of knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   He claims that BP's profit growth has partly stemmed from
transferring expertise (in drilling technology, for instance)
around the company; now these skills, built at great expense, can
be put to work across a much wider group at little extra cost. The
same logic would presumably apply to Amoco's flair for retailing.
</P>
<P>
   This is an intriguing vision. But the case for size and
creativity within a super major remains unproven. BP's return on
capital employed _ the main benchmark of profitability amongst big
oil firms _ was 14 percent in the 12 months to the end of June,
well above Shell's figure of 10 percent (Amoco scored even lower at
9 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Shell is even now starting a restructuring drive that may clamp
back on investment. As for Exxon, its 14.5 percent return has been
achieved more by returning its capital to investors through share
buybacks than by using it to grow bigger.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the oil industry's future may turn on two things where
nimbleness may count for more than size.
</P>
<P>
   The first is the long-awaited introduction of other forms of
energy _ a development where large reserves of oil may actually
prove a handicap. The other, more immediate possibility is the
reentry of western firms to the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   This is the real prize in the oil industry, both because of the
Middle East's reserves and because it still costs less than $2 a
barrel to extract oil there.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, while OPEC, which is dominated by Middle Eastern
producers, owns three-quarters of the world's proven reserves, it
currently produces only 41 percent of the world's annual oil
supply.
</P>
<P>
   This means that as non-OPEC supplies begin to dwindle, or are
made uncompetitive because of the low oil price, the importance of
the Middle East is likely to grow.
</P>
<P>
   So far, winning deals in the Middle East seems to depend in
larger part on the political astuteness and lobbying skills of oil
bosses than on the size of their capital base.
</P>
<P>
   French oil firms, such as Total and Elf, have had a head start
in negotiating deals in Iran and Iraq because their government is
more friendly to these regimes.
</P>
<P>
   As Rockefeller discovered, even the best-organized oil firms can
be undermined by politicking. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON AND NEW YORK _ Dismissively, John D. Rockefeller once
referred to the early days of the American oil industry as
``harvest time'': anybody could get rich simply by digging a hole
in the ground.
</P>
<P>
   His generation, he maintained, lived through harsher times, and
got rich through their organizational flair, or not at all. He
turned his genius to consolidation, and it made him very rich
indeed.
</P>
<P>
   With the price of Brent Crude at its lowest level in real terms
for 25 years, harsh times are here again _ and so, it appears, is
the Rockefeller vision.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest industrial merger ever, between British Petroleum
and Amoco, may herald a new era of consolidation in an industry
where mergers have been scarce of late.
</P>
<P>
   BP, whose American wing is based around the Ohio part of
Rockefeller's Standard Oil empire, is paying $48 billion to acquire
Amoco, which was created from Standard Oil of Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   Although this represents a steepish 15 percent premium over
Amoco's pre-bid value, the merger has been applauded as a good fit:
BP is generally better at the upstream part of the business
(finding and extracting oil); Amoco at the downstream business of
refining, distributing and marketing the stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Amoco's stronghold is the United States _ hitherto a weak spot
for BP. And the Chicago-based firm beefs up BP's gas and
petrochemicals divisions.
</P>
<P>
   As these empires are meshed together, there should be plenty of
savings. Sir John Browne, BP's boss, who will also head the new
company, has a flair for cutting costs that Rockefeller might have
appreciated: BP's work force now has fewer than half the 112,000
people it had in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Some 6,000 of the 99,000 jobs at the new BP Amoco are already
earmarked to go; managers' bonuses will be tied to producing $2
billion in annual pre-tax savings by the end of 2000. Businesses
that are not number one or two in their segments are likely to be
sold.
</P>
<P>
   All the same, Sir John promises much more than mere
cost-cutting. He describes both BP and Amoco as being ``at the top
of the second division.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal will put the new BP Amoco in a first division of
``super majors,'' alongside Exxon and Royal Dutch/Shell. The new
firm will on some counts be these firms' equal: it will, for
instance, have more oil and gas reserves than Exxon.
</P>
<P>
   More important, the merger puts BP in a different league from
all the other companies in the business.
</P>
<P>
   As a competitive tactic, this has already worked well. The oil
industry is now abuzz with gossip about further consolidation
involving BP's former peers, such as Chevron, Mobil and Texaco.
</P>
<P>
   BP's bosses even speculate that the news may have caused a
frisson of pain in Shell House, where its old enemy had been
concentrating on overtaking Exxon.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the question of whether the oil industry is charging in the
right direction remains unanswered.
</P>
<P>
   With stocks of oil at record levels, demand depressed in Asia,
and members of the OPEC oil cartel always ready to cheat on their
quotas, there is little hope of a dramatic rise in the oil price in
the near future.
</P>
<P>
   Having been hustled out of the Middle East long ago, all the
majors are heavily dependent on giant fields that were discovered
decades ago, many of which (particularly those in North America and
Europe) are starting to decline.
</P>
<P>
   The great task for today's oil firms is to replace these ``crown
jewels.'' In recent years a mere handful of fields containing more
than 500 million barrels have been discovered, in contrast with
dozens of big new discoveries in previous decades.
</P>
<P>
   Deep-water reserves, such as those in the Gulf of Mexico and off
the coast of West Africa, are expensive to extract. Russia, which
sits on 5 percent of the world's proven oil reserves, is prickly.
</P>
<P>
   Last year BP took a 10 percent stake in Russia's Sidanco; it
recently reported a $20 million loss due to problems there.
</P>
<P>
   The Caspian, where both BP and Amoco have struck deals, is stuck
in a tortuous geopolitical argument over the route of pipelines
from the area.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly there is natural gas: demand for the stuff is growing
more rapidly than demand for oil, in part because burning it
produces less pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Amoco has large reserves of gas. In 1988 it bought Dome
Petroleum, a Canadian gas firm, for $4.2 billion. But transporting
gas is difficult and it has no international spot market, forcing
producers to find long-term buyers before any big investment in a
gas field, which can be a long process.
</P>
<P>
   BP thinks the merger will help it deal with these difficulties.
Simply by having a broader range of countries, it should be less
vulnerable than most to upsets in any one place: Shell's problems
in Nigeria made only a small dent in its performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your appetite for risk is a function of how much capital you
have,'' one senior figure stresses. ``Now we can afford to make
bigger bets.''
</P>
<P>
   Both BP and Amoco have often had to go into partnership on big
oil deals; now they can bid alone.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a growing tendency by governments to demand that
oil companies do more than just extract oil; they have to build
infrastructure as well _ once again pushing up the cost.
</P>
<P>
   BP and Amoco also say that they will reconsider the liquefied
natural gas industry that they have shied away from in the past. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 950. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   In all this, Sir John is careful to talk about size being an
``outcome, not an aim'' and stresses his willingness to sell
businesses as well as enter them. He is adamant, however, that
scale does matter in some areas _ and even in the fashionable
business of knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   He claims that BP's profit growth has partly stemmed from
transferring expertise (in drilling technology, for instance)
around the company; now these skills, built at great expense, can
be put to work across a much wider group at little extra cost. The
same logic would presumably apply to Amoco's flair for retailing.
</P>
<P>
   This is an intriguing vision. But the case for size and
creativity within a super major remains unproven. BP's return on
capital employed _ the main benchmark of profitability amongst big
oil firms _ was 14 percent in the 12 months to the end of June,
well above Shell's figure of 10 percent (Amoco scored even lower at
9 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Shell is even now starting a restructuring drive that may clamp
back on investment. As for Exxon, its 14.5 percent return has been
achieved more by returning its capital to investors through share
buybacks than by using it to grow bigger.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the oil industry's future may turn on two things where
nimbleness may count for more than size.
</P>
<P>
   The first is the long-awaited introduction of other forms of
energy _ a development where large reserves of oil may actually
prove a handicap. The other, more immediate possibility is the
reentry of western firms to the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   This is the real prize in the oil industry, both because of the
Middle East's reserves and because it still costs less than $2 a
barrel to extract oil there.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, while OPEC, which is dominated by Middle Eastern
producers, owns three-quarters of the world's proven reserves, it
currently produces only 41 percent of the world's annual oil
supply.
</P>
<P>
   This means that as non-OPEC supplies begin to dwindle, or are
made uncompetitive because of the low oil price, the importance of
the Middle East is likely to grow.
</P>
<P>
   So far, winning deals in the Middle East seems to depend in
larger part on the political astuteness and lobbying skills of oil
bosses than on the size of their capital base.
</P>
<P>
   French oil firms, such as Total and Elf, have had a head start
in negotiating deals in Iran and Iraq because their government is
more friendly to these regimes.
</P>
<P>
   As Rockefeller discovered, even the best-organized oil firms can
be undermined by politicking. &QL;

   LONDON _ What goes on in the weird and wonderful world of the
sex, drugs and rock'n'roll President, the willy-waving leader of
the free world? Obviously not sex, drugs and rock'n'roll as we know
it, captain.
</P>
<P>
   For here is a man who can take drugs and not inhale, have some
kind of physical contact but not call it sex _ Monica did not
inhale _ and seriously pretend that rock'n'roll means the
reformation of Fleetwood Mac.
</P>
<P>
   We are expected to swallow all this and carry on grooving away
because good ol' Bill is not such a bad boy really, and the good
ol' American economy is still doing OK.
</P>
<P>
   And swallow it we do. The tedious talk of oral gratification,
the discussion of the President's genitalia, the endless
explanations of obscure legal terms, have bored us into submission.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of Americans polled believe that Clinton did have sex
with Monica Lewinsky. So it seems that the majority of Americans
believe their president is a liar and are not bothered.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of pundits here also seem to think that Clinton's sex
life is his own business _ or maybe Hillary's _ and they don't
really care either, because an adulterous Democrat is better than a
repressed Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Well, I do care, and for a long time I have thought that Clinton
cannot ride this one out.
</P>
<P>
   No one agrees with me, I know; but even if I am wrong, I wonder
how we have become so morally numb that we are prepared to go along
with this.
</P>
<P>
   If I said that all men are bastards, they only want one thing
and will use and abuse their positions of power to get it, you
might think I was a feminist.
</P>
<P>
   If I said that certain men have such appetites that they just
can't help themselves _ they lie to their wives and girlfriends,
and the more important they are, the more they think they can get
away with it _ you might assume that I was bitter and twisted.
</P>
<P>
   Feminists have, of course, been strangely silent on Bill's
behavior, not bitter and twisted enough for my liking.
</P>
<P>
   American feminism has shown itself, at least publicly, to be
even more class ridden than the British version. Clinton likes
women, goes the line, strong women; he even married one and has
promoted others. Therefore what Clinton does in the privacy of his
own office/hotel bedroom/back of car is up to him.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, just look at the women who have made the accusations:
Jennifer Flowers, Paula Jones and now Monica ``I am a pizza''
Lewinsky. They're clearly trash and, however much they are made
over, trash will out.
</P>
<P>
   Are we really to think that the lives of these kinds of women
don't matter? What sort of feminism is this, that deigns to protect
only those who least need protecting, and disses those from the
wrong side of the tracks?
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, say those who support Clinton, maybe Monica enjoyed it.
These were relationships between mutually consenting adults.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it is possible to ignore the power differential between a
president and an intern. In which case, why can't Clinton tell us
the truth?
</P>
<P>
   If he were to tell the American public tomorrow, ``Hey, guys. I
can't keep my trousers on, and you know that if you were in my
position you would be the same,'' then at least we would know which
ball park he was playing in.
</P>
<P>
   If Hillary really was a lesbian, or having affairs with his
young aides, as in ``Primary Colors,'' we could perhaps accept that
this open marriage was not a bad arrangement after all.
</P>
<P>
   But we know, don't we, what sort of men Clinton surrounds
himself with? Men who are happily instructed to order up women as
if they were fried chicken. I'll have a party bucket, please.
</P>
<P>
   Men such as Dick Morris, who once moaned about the fact that the
poor old President couldn't even get (oral gratification) in the
back of a limo these days; the man who once said ``Men are from
Mars, women are from Yellow Pages.''
</P>
<P>
   What depresses me about all those who would let Clinton off the
hook _ the
it's-not-the-sex-it's-the-lying-that-matters-and-we-all-lie-anyway
brigade _ is that yet again we have thrust down our throats the
view that male sexuality is somehow uncontrollable.
</P>
<P>
   The most powerful man in the world is reduced, even by his
supporters, to little more than a walking, talking phallus. Forget
the politics and Jesus, let us worship the sordid coupling of the
Yankee dollar and the wicked willy that can move it up and down.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the boy can't help it. Most of them can't, can they? Sex
makes their heads go funny. But if nations are to be governed by
talking sets of genitalia, why bother with policy at all? Why not
simply vote for the man with the wickedest willy of all?
</P>
<P>
   If Americans care more about having a little bit extra in their
pockets than the fact that they are represented internationally by
a known liar, then the business of politics has been successfully
replaced by business alone, and all talk of principle is entirely
worthless.
</P>
<P>
   Let the apologists for Clinton send their daughters to work for
men twice their age, whose wives don't understand them. Let the
feminists who find Clinton such a sex god, walk one mile in his
wife's shoes.
</P>
<P>
   My dream is, and I have it with upsetting regularity, is that
Hillary follows my advice (it is a dream, after all) and finally
has enough. She goes on TV and says, ``I am sick of the lies. I am
sick of him making me and all those other women lie. If you want
the truth, if you want to change America, then here I am. There is
a toll-free number, and you can make me your president simply by
ringing it.''
</P>
<P>
   The switchboard is jammed... and then I wake up and realize that
this is not going to happen.
</P>
<P>
   It looks as if Bill will stagger on with a ``he said, she said''
defense. Perhaps, at last, he has met his match in Monica. She says
she has lied all her life. He may understand that.
</P>
<P>
   This gigantic waste of time and money may be the result of an
office affair, but who ends up really paying?
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's popularity is up, though his credibility is down. How
can that be? Do we like those who are weak because they remind us
of ourselves as they fumble and lie?
</P>
<P>
   I tell you who ends up paying. All of us _ because if the most
powerful nation in the world continues to admire a cheat and a liar
then we are all diminished.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't about sex. Clinton can have sex with Saddam Hussein
for all I care. It's about power, the power to get away with
anything.
</P>
<P>
   No one has that power unless others consent to it, and it looks
to me as if the majority of people both here and in the States are
in a mutually consenting relationship with Mr. President.
</P>
<P>
   I just hope that they get as much pleasure from it as the man
Lewinsky used to call ``the big he'' does. &QL;

men twice their age, whose wives don't understand them. Let the
feminists who find Clinton such a sex god, walk one mile in his
wife's shoes.
</P>
<P>
   My dream is, and I have it with upsetting regularity, is that
Hillary follows my advice (it is a dream, after all) and finally
has enough. She goes on TV and says, ``I am sick of the lies. I am
sick of him making me and all those other women lie. If you want
the truth, if you want to change America, then here I am. There is
a toll-free number, and you can make me your president simply by
ringing it.''
</P>
<P>
   The switchboard is jammed... and then I wake up and realize that
this is not going to happen.
</P>
<P>
   It looks as if Bill will stagger on with a ``he said, she said''
defense. Perhaps, at last, he has met his match in Monica. She says
she has lied all her life. He may understand that.
</P>
<P>
   This gigantic waste of time and money may be the result of an
office affair, but who ends up really paying?
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's popularity is up, though his credibility is down. How
can that be? Do we like those who are weak because they remind us
of ourselves as they fumble and lie?
</P>
<P>
   I tell you who ends up paying. All of us _ because if the most
powerful nation in the world continues to admire a cheat and a liar
then we are all diminished.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't about sex. Clinton can have sex with Saddam Hussein
for all I care. It's about power, the power to get away with
anything.
</P>
<P>
   No one has that power unless others consent to it, and it looks
to me as if the majority of people both here and in the States are
in a mutually consenting relationship with Mr. President.
</P>
<P>
   I just hope that they get as much pleasure from it as the man
Lewinsky used to call ``the big he'' does. &QL;

 By MARY DEJEVSKY  
 c.1998 The Independent, London  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Thursday morning, wearing a dark suit and a grave
expression, President Clinton did what numbers of his predecessors
have been called upon to do: he presided over the bleak ceremonial
that attends the return of Americans killed in service overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Everything was as it should be: the Stars and Stripes at
half-mast, the precision of the military rite; the president and
the first lady. As on each such occasion in the past, Clinton's
words and demeanor were the very model of what Americans expect
from their president.
</P>
<P>
   For a Briton, the uncynical awe in which Americans hold the
president has something innocent and archaic about it, something
perhaps of the way we once regarded the monarch.
</P>
<P>
   Patriotism and national leadership, like religion, are more
intact here in the New World. Ordinary people fly the national flag
in their gardens. They respect the president and the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why the resignation of Richard Nixon, under threat of
impeachment, is widely seen even now not just as comeuppance, but
as a national tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   It is also why the fall of Bill Clinton _ who has never
pretended to perfection _ would be so hard for America to bear.
</P>
<P>
   Cut now to ``that dress.'' Is it really possible that a
president who meets so many of the requirements of his office so
admirably could be brought down by something so tawdry, so
distasteful as a stain on a young woman's dress?
</P>
<P>
   Depending on how Clinton testifies on Monday, it is not only
possible, but _ especially if the stain turns out to be what it is
alleged to be _ inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   Many in Washington, and still more in the country at large,
refuse even to entertain the possibility. They engage in some of
the mental compartmentalizing at which Clinton so excels and say
that ``sex'' is different.
</P>
<P>
   While the president may have ``sinned,'' they say, he has
committed no crime. Lying about sex should not count as perjury.
</P>
<P>
   At the further reaches of that view is the flagrantly primitive
line that the more demonstrably virile the president, the more
respected his leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Of those who would condemn the president, the most timid _ so
far - are the moralists on the political right, for whom unrepented
sin would constitute a bar to the highest office. Such a view might
have disqualified many of the more distinguished American
presidents, but it has a certain consistency.
</P>
<P>
   More vociferous are the legalists who insist that perjury is
perjury, one and indivisible. If the president lied under oath, he
should go.
</P>
<P>
   It is immaterial whether the lie came in a civil suit (as was
the Paula Jones sexual harassment suit), whether it came in
evidence that was judged ``immaterial'' (as was Clinton's in the
Paula Jones case), whether the suit was dismissed (as the Paula
Jones suit was), whether the subject was sex (as it arguably is).
</P>
<P>
   What would happen, ask the legalists, if everyone took the oath
so lightly? The whole foundation of the legal system would founder.
That way lies impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Most compelling, however, as Clinton prepares to become the
first president to testify before a grand jury in defense of his
own conduct, are the constitutionalists.
</P>
<P>
   They argue that whatever happens, whether or not a sin was
committed, whether or not the law was broken, Clinton has
diminished the office of the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Their contention is that, partly through his own fault, partly
not, Clinton bears responsibility before his successors for
curtailing the power of the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The rot set in, they say, with the Supreme Court ruling in the
Paula Jones case last year, that a sitting president could be sued
in a civil case. That one decision, fought by the president's
lawyers to no avail, drove the whole legal juggernaut that has
compelled the president's testimony in the Monica Lewinsky
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   On the way, Clinton's lawyers have fought and lost a succession
of legal contests that define the extent of presidential power _
downwards. What was hitherto ambiguous, and deliberately left that
way by previous presidents, is now marked out.
</P>
<P>
   A president's bodyguards may be required to testify against him
if he is suspected of breaking the law. Lawyers employed by the
White House rather than the president himself owe their first duty
to the taxpayers who technically pay them: their advice to the
president may not be confidential.
</P>
<P>
   A president may be subject to subpoena (compulsory court
summons), and the principle of ``executive privilege,'' which
allows a president's conversations with advisers to remain
confidential, extends no further than the requirements of national
security.
</P>
<P>
   In short, a president who has a state salary, a house of
majestic proportions, a private plane, a staff of hundreds and the
power to blow up the world has no more legal privileges than a
private citizen if he is suspected of breaking the law.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, his position is worse, because political
considerations limit his options further. If, on Monday, he were to
exercise the citizen's right to remain silent rather than
incriminate himself (take the Fifth Amendment), the world would
know, and he would be universally regarded as guilty.
</P>
<P>
   In the past seven months of the Monica Lewinsky saga, Bill
Clinton has tested the limits of the presidency, morally, legally
and constitutionally, and Americans have been generous to a fault.
</P>
<P>
   They like the man; he is charming, engaging, and ``one of
them.'' He retains the aura of office, and they respect that.
</P>
<P>
   Just now, as the hours tick away before Clinton's sworn
testimony on Monday, America seems torn between these two views of
the presidency, and two views of Bill Clinton: is the president
just like them, fallible, forgivable, but subject to the law; or is
he above judgment?
</P>
<P>
   The courts have decreed that the president is a citizen, no more
and no less. Where Clinton is concerned, however, the people so far
think otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   While bosses are summarily dismissed for dalliances with office
juniors, the President of the United States may entertain a young
woman trainee in his office and further her career with impunity.
</P>
<P>
   While officers in the armed forces are liable to discharge for
adultery, the Commander in Chief may pursue a relationship that was
temporarily discouraged by the woman's transfer to _ of all places
_ the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, it seems, can get away with it. Americans are treating
their president as a superior being, a superman, to whom man-made
rules do not apply.
</P>
<P>
   They respect his handling of the office, and he reciprocates, as
he did Thursday, with some fine presidential performances in which
America takes pride.
</P>
<P>
   As long as the popular mood and the state of the law are out of
kilter, Clinton is probably safe. But if public opinion once
catches up with the law, as it could do after Monday, Bill Clinton
will be vulnerable, if not completely done for.
</P>
<P>
   He may not, in the end, have lied under oath or broken the law.
But he has flouted the rules, rules which ordinary Americans are
expected to observe, rules he has publicly embraced.
</P>
<P>
   Were I an American voter and a Clintonite, it is this personal
double standard that would test my loyalty _ not the diminishing of
the presidency or the toying with the law, but the selfsame
question that has dogged Bill Clinton's presidency from the start:
character. &QL;

 By SUZANNE MOORE  
 c.1998 The Independent, London  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ What goes on in the weird and wonderful world of the
sex, drugs and rock'n'roll President, the willy-waving leader of
the free world? Obviously not sex, drugs and rock'n'roll as we know
it, captain.
</P>
<P>
   For here is a man who can take drugs and not inhale, have some
kind of physical contact but not call it sex _ Monica did not
inhale _ and seriously pretend that rock'n'roll means the
reformation of Fleetwood Mac.
</P>
<P>
   We are expected to swallow all this and carry on grooving away
because good ol' Bill is not such a bad boy really, and the good
ol' American economy is still doing OK.
</P>
<P>
   And swallow it we do. The tedious talk of oral gratification,
the discussion of the President's genitalia, the endless
explanations of obscure legal terms, have bored us into submission.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of Americans polled believe that Clinton did have sex
with Monica Lewinsky. So it seems that the majority of Americans
believe their president is a liar and are not bothered.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of pundits here also seem to think that Clinton's sex
life is his own business _ or maybe Hillary's _ and they don't
really care either, because an adulterous Democrat is better than a
repressed Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Well, I do care, and for a long time I have thought that Clinton
cannot ride this one out.
</P>
<P>
   No one agrees with me, I know; but even if I am wrong, I wonder
how we have become so morally numb that we are prepared to go along
with this.
</P>
<P>
   If I said that all men are bastards, they only want one thing
and will use and abuse their positions of power to get it, you
might think I was a feminist.
</P>
<P>
   If I said that certain men have such appetites that they just
can't help themselves _ they lie to their wives and girlfriends,
and the more important they are, the more they think they can get
away with it _ you might assume that I was bitter and twisted.
</P>
<P>
   Feminists have, of course, been strangely silent on Bill's
behavior, not bitter and twisted enough for my liking.
</P>
<P>
   American feminism has shown itself, at least publicly, to be
even more class ridden than the British version. Clinton likes
women, goes the line, strong women; he even married one and has
promoted others. Therefore what Clinton does in the privacy of his
own office/hotel bedroom/back of car is up to him.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, just look at the women who have made the accusations:
Jennifer Flowers, Paula Jones and now Monica ``I am a pizza''
Lewinsky. They're clearly trash and, however much they are made
over, trash will out.
</P>
<P>
   Are we really to think that the lives of these kinds of women
don't matter? What sort of feminism is this, that deigns to protect
only those who least need protecting, and disses those from the
wrong side of the tracks?
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, say those who support Clinton, maybe Monica enjoyed it.
These were relationships between mutually consenting adults.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it is possible to ignore the power differential between a
president and an intern. In which case, why can't Clinton tell us
the truth?
</P>
<P>
   If he were to tell the American public tomorrow, ``Hey, guys. I
can't keep my trousers on, and you know that if you were in my
position you would be the same,'' then at least we would know which
ball park he was playing in.
</P>
<P>
   If Hillary really was a lesbian, or having affairs with his
young aides, as in ``Primary Colors,'' we could perhaps accept that
this open marriage was not a bad arrangement after all.
</P>
<P>
   But we know, don't we, what sort of men Clinton surrounds
himself with? Men who are happily instructed to order up women as
if they were fried chicken. I'll have a party bucket, please.
</P>
<P>
   Men such as Dick Morris, who once moaned about the fact that the
poor old President couldn't even get (oral gratification) in the
back of a limo these days; the man who once said ``Men are from
Mars, women are from Yellow Pages.''
</P>
<P>
   What depresses me about all those who would let Clinton off the
hook _ the
it's-not-the-sex-it's-the-lying-that-matters-and-we-all-lie-anyway
brigade _ is that yet again we have thrust down our throats the
view that male sexuality is somehow uncontrollable.
</P>
<P>
   The most powerful man in the world is reduced, even by his
supporters, to little more than a walking, talking phallus. Forget
the politics and Jesus, let us worship the sordid coupling of the
Yankee dollar and the wicked willy that can move it up and down.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the boy can't help it. Most of them can't, can they? Sex
makes their heads go funny. But if nations are to be governed by
talking sets of genitalia, why bother with policy at all? Why not
simply vote for the man with the wickedest willy of all?
</P>
<P>
   If Americans care more about having a little bit extra in their
pockets than the fact that they are represented internationally by
a known liar, then the business of politics has been successfully
replaced by business alone, and all talk of principle is entirely
worthless.
</P>
<P>
   Let the apologists for Clinton send their daughters to work for
men twice their age, whose wives don't understand them. Let the
feminists who find Clinton such a sex god, walk one mile in his
wife's shoes.
</P>
<P>
   My dream is, and I have it with upsetting regularity, is that
Hillary follows my advice (it is a dream, after all) and finally
has enough. She goes on TV and says, ``I am sick of the lies. I am

a toll-free number, and you can make me your president simply by

</P>
<P>
   The switchboard is jammed... and then I wake up and realize that
this is not going to happen.
</P>
<P>
   It looks as if Bill will stagger on with a ``he said, she said''
defense. Perhaps, at last, he has met his match in Monica. She says
she has lied all her life. He may understand that.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Shooting those who annoy you is really bad
manners, but Nintendo has come up with a fun and socially
acceptable way to do it. And nobody gets hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Buy their Game Boy Camera, attach the $50 gizmo to a Game Boy,
and voila, you can shoot like mad.
</P>
<P>
   Take up to 30 pictures, decorate them, print them out on a
special $60 printer, even paste the faces of your ``victims'' into
any of four simple games that come with it.
</P>
<P>
   Then at lunch time, paste a picture of that aggravating boss
over the image of the bad guy in the Space Invaders-like Space
Fever II and start blasting away. This is revenge.
</P>
<P>
   The camera itself is tiny, like an undersize QuickCam attached
to a PCMCIA card, but laden with features. Once a picture is
snapped, the gadget allows you to doodle on it, use ``rubber
stamps'' to decorate it, flip it, stretch it, choose the frame of
your choice and print it on thermal transfer paper or stickers.
</P>
<P>
   The camera has time-lapse and slide-show modes, swivels 180
degrees so you can take pictures of yourself or others, and even
has a simple animation mode capable of stowing 47 shots.
</P>
<P>
   The many functions and cheap price of the Game Boy Camera remind
me of the little black-and-white video cameras that Fisher-Price
sold a decade ago that went on to become prized tools for adult
video artists who loved the low-res look and lower cost.
</P>
<P>
   In something of the same way, the surprising talents of the Game
Boy Camera might actually unlock the creativity not only of kids
but adults with great imaginations. And that's what makes a great
gadget.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to believe but 50 years ago this summer, Columbia
Records debuted the first long-playing vinyl record, changing
forever the way the public and artists thought about music.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, there was enough space on a record to hold a
series of songs, not just one on each side. Finally, it was
possible to create a real album, with a series of songs that
coherently connected to each other instead of a jumble of singles
and B-sides.
</P>
<P>
   A great interview of two pioneers from that time, George Avakian
and Howard ``Scotty'' Scott, ran in a recent issue of Classic
Records' in-house publication, the Audio File. Classic is a small
label specializing in high-end recordings on vinyl and CD for
serious audio buffs.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, the two detailed the bitter rivalry between
Columbia owner William Paley and RCA owner David Sarnoff, which
resulted in the same kind of format war that since has bedeviled
everything from computers to DVDs.
</P>
<P>
   In the LP's case, Columbia researchers worked under strict
secrecy for months to perfect a new, high-quality format that would
revolve 331/3 times per minute, rather than the old-style 78 rpm
records then available.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in June 1948, Columbia announced its creation, debuting
with 100 titles and Philco record players (initially costing
$29.95, later $9.95).
</P>
<P>
   According to Avakian and Scott, three weeks before the big
announcement, Paley showed the equipment to Sarnoff, trying to
persuade him to get RCA's many top-selling artists on the format.
</P>
<P>
   But Sarnoff, furious at being upstaged, refused to participate.
He set his researchers to creating another record format,
eventually resulting in 45 rpm records.
</P>
<P>
   But RCA was two years behind at this point, with a lower-quality
format that held less music per side. Though it would be years and
millions of dollars in losses before RCA gave in, Columbia soon
cashed in when the Broadway cast recording of ``South Pacific''
sold 1 million copies.
</P>
<P>
   In an amusing aside, Avakian said when he later went to work for
RCA, he was told the company had settled on the 45-rpm speed
because it was the difference when 33 was subtracted from 78. Out
of spite for Columbia's creation, RCA decided that was the
appropriate speed for its own invention.
</P>
<P>
   And though CDs now reign triumphant, LPs aren't dead. Hard-core
audio fans still swear by the warmer, fuller sound of vinyl and
will snap up an estimated 3.5 million vinyl records this year.
</P>
<P>
   Like its namesake, the new Sony PlayStation game Nitrous Oxide
will leave you a little lightheaded _ but definitely feeling good.
</P>
<P>
   The game combines a pulsing soundtrack by techno band the
Crystal Method, including a rare DJ remix of its hit ``Busy
Child,'' with a stunning lightshow of a game that feels like a
post-millennial version of the classic arcade game Tempest.
</P>
<P>
   Players fly in nap-of-the-Earth fashion through tunnels filled
with lethal bugs and pulsing lights, skimming along the tunnel's
edge in three dimensions. Visually, the game is gorgeous and
remarkably fluid. And like its namesake, it has a certain addictive
quality that's hard to escape.
</P>
<P>
   And though the game involves shooting lots of bugs at very high
speeds, parents will be glad to know it doesn't feel particularly
violent.
</P>
<P>
   The bugs are stylized, and they cartwheel into the horizon when
shot rather than exploding in Doom-like gore. I felt comfortable
letting my 6- and 7-year-old play the game, which they did with
great gusto. The game quickly had my 6-year-old son whooping and
talking trash as he whipped through the first couple of levels.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the Crystal Method, the band's fall tour will be
sponsored by Nitrous Oxide publisher Fox Interactive, which plans
to put kiosks running the game at each concert venue on the tour.
</P>
<P>
   For those whose lusts tend more toward gear than girls,
Ziff-Davis has come out with a new magazine for the
techno-insatiable called Equip.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine is sleek and attractive, but its coverage is so
wide-ranging, looking at a couple of dozen different categories of
equipment, that any individual article seems rather superficial.
</P>
<P>
   Most features spotlight a handful of contenders in a category
such as digital video disc players. It picks the best overall
model, best design and best value, along with some simple advice on
how best to choose the tech of your dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I'd prefer Ziff-Davis give its frequently touted
product-testing labs more of a workout in each category by looking
at a broader number of products. Between the gorgeous photos of
sleek equipment and the text-light stories, this is about as close
to porn for the technological elite as it gets.
</P>
<P>
   But then again, there's always Consumer Reports if I want to
gorge on product comparisons. Check it out. If nothing else, it
will reward companies with an eye toward great industrial design,
which is always a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   For a quick peek at Activision's terrific new first-person
shooter computer game, start checking around the Net, where a demo
of the first two solo and multiplayer levels of Sin are available
free.
</P>
<P>
   The game is based on the Quake engine but has been gussied up in
a number of ways with terrific graphics, a variety of weapons and,
wonder of wonders, levels that don't just reward blasting
everything that moves. In some cases, stealth and using one's
``hands'' is smarter and more successful than pulling out the
street-sweeper shotgun and yanking the trigger like mad.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such radical concepts, the game should find favor among
the twitchy-fingered teens who love the genre. The full game debuts
in early September.

WOMEN LOVE HARRISON FORD, CANDLELIGHT AND SOAP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BARBARA DE WITT 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; It's no big surprise that Harrison Ford was voted
the sexiest man alive ... or that ``Ally McBeal'' was rated the
sexiest TV show in a national poll of women readers for InStyle
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   But perfume manufacturers might get their noses out of joint
learning that the sexiest scent in America is ... soap.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also reported young women like daredevils over
bookworms, candle-lit dinners over picnics, power over money and
think firemen have the sexiest job.
</P>
<P>
   FILE UNDER `BARE-CHESTER HUNKS': Speaking of buffed babes, Miz
Hot Tips discovered a bunch of them _ right out of Playgirl
magazine _ on nail files. It's a novelty collection called Man
Files from Toma Industries in North Hollywood that features color
photos of bare-chested hunks, including Scott Lane, Playgirl
magazine's 1998 Man of the Year. Each photo is bonded to a durable
Mylar surface that's washable and is priced at $3 at nail salons or
directly from the company. For younger girls, the company also
makes nail files with happy faces and teddy bears. For more
information, call (800) 843-4606.
</P>
<P>
   SHOPPER'S ALERT: Love St. John knit suits and Ferragamo pumps
but can't afford them? Miz Hot Tips learned that the Discovery
Shop, 4454 Van Nuys Blvd., Sherman Oaks, received a huge collection
of hardly worn, recent designs by St. John, as well as Donna Karan,
Christian Dior, Lily Rubin and Nolan Miller, all in larger sizes,
including 12 and 16. Plus Ferragamo shoes.
</P>
<P>
   And they're on sale today from 10 a.m. until midnight for about
a fourth of the original price. All proceeds benefit the American
Cancer Society's Valley projects.
</P>
<P>
   YOU'RE SO MOODY: Remember those mood rings that were supposed to
register your true feelings? You know, blue for incredibly happy,
brown for feelin' just OK?
</P>
<P>
   The Estee Lauder company must be in a nostalgic mood, as its
latest novelty is the Attitude Compact, a small powder-filled
compact that changes color to reveal your mood (happy, sad, tense)
in 10 seconds. Miz Hot Tips tried it and found that it took more
like 15 or 20 seconds to turn it from black to blue, but maybe she
was in a bad mood ...
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, it's way cute and could provide a conversation op for
life's awkward moments, like first dates or when you're trapped in
a stalled elevator with a dozen strangers. Look for them at
department stores, priced at $32.50.
</P>
<P>
   HOW PERSONAL: Back in the '60s, a number of pop singers wrote
songs about girls they adored, but you probably weren't one of
them. Neither was Miz Hot Tips. So she was thrilled about a new Los
Angeles-based company called Song for You. For $59.95, they'll
create a shiny gold CD with your (or a loved one's) name on it, and
provide a song _ pop, country or opera _ all about you, using
information you provide. They have a variety of witty
special-occasion songs for birthdays and anniversaries, too. For
more information, call (800) 789-7664.

IN MEXICO CITY, OUTDOOR ADVERTISING IS A SIGN OF THE TIMES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Aug. 16)  
 (EDs: Photos available on Wieck database)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PHILIP TRUE  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Not all of the curves around the Mexican capital's
major traffic arteries are in the roadway.
</P>
<P>
   A satiny brunette gazes down on frazzled commuters on the
Periferico Norte freeway, pumps a bicep, and touts the only article
of clothing she wears.
</P>
<P>
   ``The weaker sex? Me?'' the model asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``100 percent Wonderbra'' the billboard assures.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, on the transition road to the Viaducto Miguel Aleman,
a coquettish cheerleader type sporting a full-coverage Loveable
brassiere that a grandmother could probably wear to church
advocates ``Don't hide, discover your beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   And all over the city, leggy beauties wearing micro-minis ending
just south of the intersection of the models' hip and thigh hype
various brands of panty hose.
</P>
<P>
   It is a capitalist axiom that sex sells, and outdoor advertisers
here have caught on with a vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is pleased.
</P>
<P>
   ``The billboards are popping up like mushrooms everywhere you
look in the city, blocking people's view of trees, mountains,
volcanoes, churches and monuments,'' said Homero Aridjis, a poet,
social critic and ecologist, and president of the prestigious
Committee of 100 environmental group.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a pollution of brassieres and underwear, alcohol and
tobacco, junk food and luxury cars,'' Aridjis complained. ``Mexico
City is fast becoming more a Calcutta of the mind than the valley
painted and lyricized by generations of artists.''
</P>
<P>
   Diana Ponce Nava wants to do something about that.
</P>
<P>
   Ponce is the director of environmental projects under Cuauhtemoc
Cardenas Solorzano, elected mayor of Mexico City last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is a great anger amongst the public about all of
this,'' Ponce said in a recent interview. ``It is mostly the
business types who support this explosion. I don't think there are
very many people who say that the billboards actually relieve the
monotony of sitting in traffic on the periferico.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 6,000 of the billboards are illegal, Ponce said. She
intends to remove them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are working on a two-pronged project,'' she explained.
``First, we want the illegal signs taken down. Then, we are working
on a new regulatory code that will give us back control over our
open spaces.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, the city has ordered more than 150 billboards removed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That leaves us only 5,850 to go,'' Ponce said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, at least one sign recently removed _ it had a
pole planted squarely in the middle of a city sidewalk _ announced
an exhibit in a municipal cultural museum.
</P>
<P>
   There is little doubt billboards are a growth industry in Mexico
City.
</P>
<P>
   They crowd sidewalks and streets everywhere, looming over
roadways, parks and plazas, invading landscaped boulevard dividers.
</P>
<P>
   Ponce said she could document instances where advertisers have
cut down three or four trees to improve the billboard's exposure.
The battle is perhaps most vicious for the prime space along the
city's freeways.
</P>
<P>
   Looking down onto a freeway from a pedestrian overpass, one
might easily forget there is a city surrounding the
bumper-to-bumper traffic, so closely spaced are the wall-to-wall
billboards.
</P>
<P>
   The damage is not all visual, Aridjis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The overwhelming use of the female body to sell spawns a
tremendous sexism among the people and a degradation of
sexuality,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One downtown sign suggested that for chest congestion, a
particular brand of pills could provide relief. Accompanying the
text was a waist-up shot of a busty young model wearing a bikini
top.
</P>
<P>
   Too, it is considered hip among advertisers to meld English into
the Spanish text of most of the signs, creating a kind of Spanglish
that Aridjis called ``language pollution.''
</P>
<P>
   Stringent city regulations on billboards have been on the books
for at least a decade. But past administrations have done little to
enforce them.
</P>
<P>
   Aridjis questions whether some of the mammoth signs are
structurally sound.
</P>
<P>
   One day in May, strong winds blew down 15 billboards, the Mexico
City daily newspaper Reforma reported. No one was injured, but
homes and cars were damaged. Only one of the billboards was
licensed, the newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
   Responsible advertisers are just as concerned as Ponce and
Aridjis, said Leticia Rodriguez Moctezuma, executive secretary of
the Mexican Association of Outdoor Advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez said her organization represents more than 80 percent
of all of Mexico's billboard operators.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the sign industry was out of control until a year
ago,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new administration is trying to establish control, and
that is good,'' she said. ``It guarantees citizens a better city
and advertisers a secure investment on their properties.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Regulations adopted in past administrations were too strict and
enforcement too lax, so no one bothered to comply, Rodriguez said.
And in those cases where a city official actually did complain,
under-the-table payments usually smoothed things over, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez said the 6,000 signs that Ponce complained about are
``not illegal, but unregulated.''
</P>
<P>
   The solution is not to take down the signs, because that would
cost jobs, she said.
</P>
<P>
   In all Mexico, about 60,000 people depend directly or indirectly
on the outdoor advertising industry; 48,000 of them live in Mexico
City alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We in the industry want regulations that we can live with. I
think we can work with the new administration to find a way to
settle things,'' Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   That remains to be seen, as Ponce said that her vision of Mexico
City is more like that of European cities, where billboard
regulations are far more restrictive.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps a cynical limit of sorts was reached with the recent
message pasted to a billboard on a sweeping curve in the city's
Circuito Interior freeway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Murphy's Law,'' the sign read. ``Just as you turn to read this
sign, the car in front of you will brake.''
</P>
<P>
   It was paid for by an auto insurance company.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Just weeks ago, after many rounds of hard bargaining, the IMF
finally authorized a $22.6 billion loan package for Russia.
Meanwhile, the Russian markets have continued to plunge and the
fear that Russia would devalue the ruble is as strong as ever.
Despite initial optimism from the IMF, investors are apparently
still full of doubt, asking hard questions about progress before
they put their money into Russia.
 &HT;    Amid all this, the ordinary men and women on the street are
living day to day, trying to feed their children, often going for
weeks and months unpaid, despite holding, perhaps, two or three
jobs and exhausting themselves with work.
 &HT;    What is the problem here? Is Russia, as the president states,
really under control?
 &HT;    Other questions are being asked too both in Russia and the West:
Has the IMF done the right thing? Will the new IMF bailout affect
the Russian situation in a positive way? How can IMF money
influence the course of events in Russia?
 &HT;    At home and abroad, I am asked whether aid to Russia is
necessary and, if so, what kind of aid. Legitimate questions, all
of them.
 &HT;    It seems that the new monetary package is an endorsement of the
program of anti-crisis measures proposed by the government of Prime
Minister Kirienko. When presenting the plan to Parliament, the
prime minister said that the Cabinet was in effect charting a new
economic policy aimed above all at reviving production.
 &HT;    But it is already clear that the new economic policy is no more
than a mirage. The measures that the government has been able to
push through the Duma and the recent presidential decrees merely
introduce tougher fiscal policies in accordance with IMF
requirements.
 &HT;    Whatever modest steps were initially planned to stimulate
production _ the real economy _ have now been dropped from the
government's program. The tax burden is set to increase, most of it
falling on the beleaguered people. Hence, the too-small amounts of
real income and effective demand can be expected to shrink. With
tax pressures on business continuing to increase, economic growth
will not resume.
 &HT;    In today's global society, a total collapse of the Russian
economy would send tremors throughout the world. The old Cold War
thinking _ ``let them suffer, we will win'' _ has no place in this
world where boundaries are slim and we are one people.
 &HT;    If Russia and its partners are facing a dead end, this has
strong implications for the West, for Asia and for the rest of the
world.
 &HT;    What I believe is that the root causes of the crisis _ despite
Western bailouts _ lie in Russia. They lie in the flawed economic
policies pursued for seven years now with the West's support. These
policies have had a bad effect on Russia. They have discredited
democracy and magnified corruption, lawlessness and arbitrary rule.
They have allowed organized crime to penetrate ever deeper into the
bodies of government.
 &HT;    The point at issue is this: How long do we wait? Will the loans
save the day? Will they cause the inertia to be reversed?
 &HT;    In Russia, most analysts feel that the IMF package, based on the
pledges of the president and the Kirienko government, just like the
previous bailout in spring 1997, is bound to fail because it lacks
popular support. If so _ and the conclusion rings true _ what
should we expect? Moscow is awash with scenarios trying to predict
further developments.
 &HT;    If the president and his entourage continue to insist on a
flawed and unworkable economic program, it could ignite mass
protest. Currently, 90 percent of those polled think that a social
upheaval could erupt in Russia in the near future. It is quite
ominous and the events could go out of control. This is an
unacceptable scenario.
 &HT;    But there is a different course of action, which offers a
realistic alternative to chaos. I suggest that if the breathing
space allowed by the IMF loan _ we were told that it would allow us
a respite _ does exist, then it should be used as time to chart a
more or less orderly way out of the most dramatic phase of the
current crisis.
 &HT;    It is up to us to implement the reforms that best suit our own
circumstances. Our reforms are entirely our responsibility. We do
need support from other nations. I am, however, against handouts.
We need equal and mutually beneficial cooperation.
 &HT;    I believe we should have early presidential and parliamentary
elections, held simultaneously, this fall or early spring, to open
the way to a type of federal government that would have credibility
among a majority of the Russian people and thus be strong enough to
implement a program for ending Russia's crisis.
 &HT;    The president should call for these elections, and they should
be coupled with a referendum on certain sections of the
Constitution, in order to reallocate the powers of government
between the president, the cabinet and parliament. Russia's 1993
Constitution, which vested the president with unlimited powers, has
turned out to be both unworkable and dangerous.
 &HT;    It is a source of political instability, engendering
irresponsible behavior and confrontation between the branches of
government.
 &HT;    I also propose submitting to the referendum a constitutional
amendment creating a post of life-long senator for former
presidents after they leave office. Such an initiative would help
to ease this very dramatic moment, avoiding a dangerous division in
Russian society and assuring a democratic transition from one team
to another.
 &HT;    The time has come for the president to prove that Russia's
interests and stability and, above all, the interests of its people
are indeed his highest priority.

protest. Currently, 90 percent of those polled think that a social
upheaval could erupt in Russia in the near future. It is quite
ominous and the events could go out of control. This is an
unacceptable scenario.
 &HT;    But there is a different course of action, which offers a
realistic alternative to chaos. I suggest that if the breathing
space allowed by the IMF loan _ we were told that it would allow us
a respite _ does exist, then it should be used as time to chart a
more or less orderly way out of the most dramatic phase of the
current crisis.
 &HT;    It is up to us to implement the reforms that best suit our own
circumstances. Our reforms are entirely our responsibility. We do
need support from other nations. I am, however, against handouts.
We need equal and mutually beneficial cooperation.
 &HT;    I believe we should have early presidential and parliamentary
elections, held simultaneously, this fall or early spring, to open
the way to a type of federal government that would have credibility
among a majority of the Russian people and thus be strong enough to
implement a program for ending Russia's crisis.
 &HT;    The president should call for these elections, and they should
be coupled with a referendum on certain sections of the
Constitution, in order to reallocate the powers of government
between the president, the cabinet and parliament. Russia's 1993
Constitution, which vested the president with unlimited powers, has
turned out to be both unworkable and dangerous.
 &HT;    It is a source of political instability, engendering
irresponsible behavior and confrontation between the branches of
government.
 &HT;    I also propose submitting to the referendum a constitutional
amendment creating a post of life-long senator for former
presidents after they leave office. Such an initiative would help
to ease this very dramatic moment, avoiding a dangerous division in
Russian society and assuring a democratic transition from one team
to another.
 &HT;    The time has come for the president to prove that Russia's
interests and stability and, above all, the interests of its people
are indeed his highest priority.

IN MEXICO CITY, OUTDOOR ADVERTISING IS A SIGN OF THE TIMES

<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Not all of the curves around the Mexican capital's
major traffic arteries are in the roadway.
</P>
<P>
   A satiny brunette gazes down on frazzled commuters on the
Periferico Norte freeway, pumps a bicep, and touts the only article
of clothing she wears.
</P>
<P>
   ``The weaker sex? Me?'' the model asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``100 percent Wonderbra'' the billboard assures.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, on the transition road to the Viaducto Miguel Aleman,
a coquettish cheerleader type sporting a full-coverage Loveable
brassiere that a grandmother could probably wear to church
advocates ``Don't hide, discover your beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   And all over the city, leggy beauties wearing micro-minis ending
just south of the intersection of the models' hip and thigh hype
various brands of panty hose.
</P>
<P>
   It is a capitalist axiom that sex sells, and outdoor advertisers
here have caught on with a vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is pleased.
</P>
<P>
   ``The billboards are popping up like mushrooms everywhere you
look in the city, blocking people's view of trees, mountains,
volcanoes, churches and monuments,'' said Homero Aridjis, a poet,
social critic and ecologist, and president of the prestigious
Committee of 100 environmental group.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a pollution of brassieres and underwear, alcohol and
tobacco, junk food and luxury cars,'' Aridjis complained. ``Mexico
City is fast becoming more a Calcutta of the mind than the valley
painted and lyricized by generations of artists.''
</P>
<P>
   Diana Ponce Nava wants to do something about that.
</P>
<P>
   Ponce is the director of environmental projects under Cuauhtemoc
Cardenas Solorzano, elected mayor of Mexico City last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is a great anger amongst the public about all of
this,'' Ponce said in a recent interview. ``It is mostly the
business types who support this explosion. I don't think there are
very many people who say that the billboards actually relieve the
monotony of sitting in traffic on the periferico.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 6,000 of the billboards are illegal, Ponce said. She
intends to remove them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are working on a two-pronged project,'' she explained.
``First, we want the illegal signs taken down. Then, we are working
on a new regulatory code that will give us back control over our
open spaces.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, the city has ordered more than 150 billboards removed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That leaves us only 5,850 to go,'' Ponce said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, at least one sign recently removed _ it had a
pole planted squarely in the middle of a city sidewalk _ announced
an exhibit in a municipal cultural museum.
</P>
<P>
   There is little doubt billboards are a growth industry in Mexico
City.
</P>
<P>
   They crowd sidewalks and streets everywhere, looming over
roadways, parks and plazas, invading landscaped boulevard dividers.
</P>
<P>
   Ponce said she could document instances where advertisers have
cut down three or four trees to improve the billboard's exposure.
The battle is perhaps most vicious for the prime space along the
city's freeways.
</P>
<P>
   Looking down onto a freeway from a pedestrian overpass, one
might easily forget there is a city surrounding the
bumper-to-bumper traffic, so closely spaced are the wall-to-wall
billboards.
</P>
<P>
   The damage is not all visual, Aridjis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The overwhelming use of the female body to sell spawns a
tremendous sexism among the people and a degradation of
sexuality,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One downtown sign suggested that for chest congestion, a
particular brand of pills could provide relief. Accompanying the
text was a waist-up shot of a busty young model wearing a bikini
top.
</P>
<P>
   Too, it is considered hip among advertisers to meld English into
the Spanish text of most of the signs, creating a kind of Spanglish
that Aridjis called ``language pollution.''
</P>
<P>
   Stringent city regulations on billboards have been on the books
for at least a decade. But past administrations have done little to
enforce them.
</P>
<P>
   Aridjis questions whether some of the mammoth signs are
structurally sound.
</P>
<P>
   One day in May, strong winds blew down 15 billboards, the Mexico
City daily newspaper Reforma reported. No one was injured, but
homes and cars were damaged. Only one of the billboards was
licensed, the newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
   Responsible advertisers are just as concerned as Ponce and
Aridjis, said Leticia Rodriguez Moctezuma, executive secretary of
the Mexican Association of Outdoor Advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez said her organization represents more than 80 percent
of all of Mexico's billboard operators.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the sign industry was out of control until a year
ago,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new administration is trying to establish control, and
that is good,'' she said. ``It guarantees citizens a better city
and advertisers a secure investment on their properties.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Regulations adopted in past administrations were too strict and
enforcement too lax, so no one bothered to comply, Rodriguez said.
And in those cases where a city official actually did complain,
under-the-table payments usually smoothed things over, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez said the 6,000 signs that Ponce complained about are
``not illegal, but unregulated.''
</P>
<P>
   The solution is not to take down the signs, because that would
cost jobs, she said.
</P>
<P>
   In all Mexico, about 60,000 people depend directly or indirectly
on the outdoor advertising industry; 48,000 of them live in Mexico
City alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We in the industry want regulations that we can live with. I
think we can work with the new administration to find a way to
settle things,'' Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   That remains to be seen, as Ponce said that her vision of Mexico
City is more like that of European cities, where billboard
regulations are far more restrictive.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps a cynical limit of sorts was reached with the recent
message pasted to a billboard on a sweeping curve in the city's
Circuito Interior freeway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Murphy's Law,'' the sign read. ``Just as you turn to read this
sign, the car in front of you will brake.''
</P>
<P>
   It was paid for by an auto insurance company.

DAVID GRAHAM SAYS HE TOOK BLAME FOR FORMER GIRLFRIEND DIANE ZAMORA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT THARP 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ David Graham, a convicted murderer, expects
many to think him a liar.
</P>
<P>
   He knows that the detailed account he wrote describing his
involvement in the brutal murder of 16-year-old Adrianne Jones
sealed his fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew when I signed the confession that was pretty much my
future,'' said Graham, 20. ``I didn't think it at the time, but
when I look back, I realize that it's going to be hard for anyone
to believe me. What can I do?''
</P>
<P>
   During a wide-ranging interview this week in the basement of
Tarrant County Jail, Graham was subdued as he talked about the
Jones case. The case attracted national attention because of its
titillating combination of two U.S. military academy students mixed
up in love, sex, revenge and murder. Even Graham says the case was
like a soap opera.
</P>
<P>
   Graham said that his confession _ which describes Jones' slaying
as well as the manic teen-age romance with his former fiancee,
Diane Zamora, a former Naval Academy student _ was written because
he had agreed to take the blame with Zamora for the slaying. That
confession, along with extensive publicity about the case, probably
swayed jurors the most, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In saying that I pulled the trigger, I was protecting her from
a large amount of the blame,'' Graham, a former Air Force Academy
student, said in his first print interview. ``More just to be with
her in it, to stand with her.''
</P>
<P>
   At his trial last month, Graham abandoned that ground.
</P>
<P>
   He disavowed the confession, which stated that he killed Jones,
and he denied that he was present when Jones was beaten and shot
along a rural road in Grand Prairie, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   When asked where he was on that cold, predawn morning of Dec. 4,
1995, Graham smiled, turned to his attorney and asked, ``Can I tell
him?''
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Rob Swofford said that disclosing the
information must wait because it is vital to winning a new trial.
Investigators are searching for witnesses to support Graham's
contention that he was elsewhere when Jones was killed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have said that if Graham has an alibi, it would have
surfaced during his trial.
</P>
<P>
   While investigators pursue his story and lawyers prepare for the
appeal, Graham, dressed in a tan county jail jumpsuit and plastic
sandals, awaits transfer to a prison where he will probably spend
the next 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   These days, he said, he writes to friends, many of whom ask for
photos of him. He reads the newspaper daily and monitors TV news
programs about the case. He has a single cell, but for six hours a
day, he can use a larger room with a TV and a shower. He also talks
on the phone, runs in place and does push-ups, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Once in prison, Graham said, he plans to stay out of trouble
because he's ``not the kind of guy who gets in fights.'' He hopes
to take college courses in science and math and possibly teach
other inmates.
</P>
<P>
   He is reading the Bible, he said, and Herman Melville's ``Billy
Budd,'' a short story often assigned in literature classes about a
naive young man unable to defend himself against a wrongful
accusation. He started reading it during his trial in New
Braunfels, and he said he identifies with the main character on
some levels. But he said he is not as simple as Billy Budd.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's different, because he's so naive and innocent. He doesn't
understand the ways of the world,'' Graham said.
</P>
<P>
   Graham's understanding of the world also may be a bit askew,
based on his recanted confession and his view of his relationship
with Zamora, 20.
</P>
<P>
   Zamora became consumed with an erroneous idea that Graham and
Jones were romantically involved, Graham said. Only after he
learned of Jones' slaying did Graham agree to take part in a
cover-up to protect Zamora, he said.
</P>
<P>
   When Graham and Zamora were originally arrested, police said the
couple told them they killed Jones because she had sex with Graham,
and Zamora wanted revenge. Since then, Graham has denied having a
sexual relationship with Jones.
</P>
<P>
   In separate trials that resulted in capital murder convictions,
prosecutors argued that Zamora and Graham acted together, plotting
and carrying out Jones' death as a way to salvage their
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Because of his love for Zamora, Graham said, he never seriously
considered calling police during the nine months that the slaying
went unsolved.
</P>
<P>
   He described attending a school memorial service for Jones
immediately after her death as ``hard'' but said being with Zamora
was more important than the Jones family's anguish.
</P>
<P>
   That same obsession, Graham said, allowed him to see a childhood
friend, Bryan McMillen, falsely arrested for the slaying and spend
more than two weeks behind bars. Graham said he had known McMillen
off and on since the two were in kindergarten in Mansfield, Texas,
yet he never thought to tell police that McMillen wasn't guilty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was dedicated to protecting Diane,'' he said. ``I wouldn't
have thought twice about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham said he still thinks about Zamora but adds emphatically
that he is no longer in love with her.
</P>
<P>
   Although Zamora described him during her trial as domineering,
violent and the mastermind behind Jones' death, Graham said he
thinks Zamora could still have feelings for him. He said he has
learned that she wore her engagement ring to prison but that it was
stolen.
</P>
<P>
   After Zamora's conviction, Graham wrote her a letter saying he
was ``sorry her life turned out this way.'' Each received an
automatic life sentence and must spend at least 40 years in prison
before becoming eligible for parole.
</P>
<P>
   ``Diane and I were people you'd expect to have great futures.
It's so out of the ordinary,'' he said. ``Plus Adrianne was like
Diane and I, she was popular and athletic and smart. So three
people, all three of our lives were destroyed. Plus the love
triangle and the sex appeal, it's kind of like a soap opera.''

HISPANIC TRAILBLAZERS GET LONG-OVERDUE CREDIT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE FERMAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   No question about it, documentation of the contribution
Hispanics have made to the world of pop music has been scant at
best.
</P>
<P>
   Go to any bookstore with a well-stocked section on pop music.
Look through the numerous bios of Elvis and Jimi, the collections
of essays, the handful of books devoted strictly to blues or jazz:
You might not see anything about Hispanic music at all. I know I
don't, and I've looked.
</P>
<P>
   The new ``Land of a Thousand Dances: Chicano Rock 'n' Roll From
Southern California'' will not single-handedly correct this
oversight, but it's a very good start.
</P>
<P>
   The book (178 pages; University of New Mexico Press; $18.95
paperback, $50 hardcover) is a handsome, well-researched effort. It
traces the development of Hispanic R&AMP;B and rock _ from
Mexican-Americans falling under the spell of doo-wop in the
mid-'50s to the explosion of bands in the '60s to El Chicano in the
'70s to Los Lobos emerging in the '80s to rapper Kid Frost
releasing ``La Raza'' in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   This is a fascinating journey, showing America's cultural
cross-fertilization at its best, and how music in one particular
community has been shaped by both internal and external forces.
</P>
<P>
   One telling example: Back in the mid-'60s, Cannibal and the
Headhunters would, we're told, work in front of a mirror for hours,
imitating the choreography of Motown's Temptations. Just a few
years later, their ``Land of 1000 Dances'' would become a national
hit for R&AMP;B star Wilson Pickett.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a beautiful thing,'' says David Reyes, who wrote the
book over the past decade with Tom Waldman. Reyes grew up in the
music of East Los Angeles; he went to shows at LA clubs and union
halls and, as a saxophonist, began playing with LA bands in the
late '60s. ``In the late '50s Watts artists knew East LA was a big
market, and they went out of their way to perform there. It was
unique, because the rock scene in LA had everything, R&AMP;B and pop,
and we did it our own way.''
</P>
<P>
   In this way, the LA Hispanic rock/R&AMP;B scene was far more
advanced (and got more attention) than the one in most large Texas
cities. For one thing, so many record companies have offices out
there; for another, LA was, and is, such a melting pot; there was a
large, multifaceted black music scene so close by.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas there certainly were cases of Tex-Mex, rock and R&AMP;B
being combined. Probably the best-known are San Antonio's Sir
Douglas Quintet, which had a huge hit in 1965 with ``She's About a
Mover,'' and Dallas' Sam the Sham and the Pharoahs, which had
several hits in the mid-'60s with Tex-Mex-meets-rock tunes like
``Wooly Bully'' and ``Lil' Red Riding Hood.''
</P>
<P>
   Reyes remembers his older brothers coming home every Saturday
with a stack of singles (they were 29 cents then) and the family
sitting down and listening to them. The bands were local acts like
Thee Midniters, the Headhunters, Mark and the Escorts, and The
Premiers.
</P>
<P>
   All added their own cultural twists to the sounds coming out of
England or Detroit or the Deep South, and all became superstars in
their hometowns. In most cases, their fame _ like that of dozens of
bands who made it big in their hometown _ stopped there.
</P>
<P>
   Cannibal and the Headhunters opened for the Beatles in 1965, but
even that couldn't break them nationally, although Pickett's
version of ``Dances'' became, and remains, extremely popular. And
The Premiers' ``Farmer John'' became a Top 20 hit in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   The book never really addresses why more Latino groups didn't
hit the mainstream, but in many cases it was probably simply a case
of so much competition and, to some extent, the unfamiliarity of
white-bread America with Hispanic culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Social clubs and parish clubs were the thing,'' Reyes
remembers. ``They'd have dances every Friday and Saturday. There
were literally hundreds and hundreds of bands _ it was a huge
scene.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Reyes collected the singles, and the albums. He
and Waldman collaborated on an article on Thee Midniters for the
music magazine ``Goldmine,'' and then decided to expand on it to
write about the entire LA scene. Reyes used his contacts, calling
musicians and managers he knew. They, in turn, hooked him up with
other people. And now he and Waldman are planning a second volume.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll cover more from the '80s on,'' Reyes says. ``And it'll
look at the lesser-known groups from the '60s, when there were so
many bands. It was an incredible time. There was a lot of unity
going on.''
</P>
<P>
   And if reading ``Dances'' makes you want to go back and
rediscover this music, you're in luck: Rhino Records has released a
three-volume set, ``Brown-Eyed Soul: The Sound of East L.A.,'' that
includes many of the groups mentioned in the book. It's great
listening, just as ``Thousand'' is very good reading _ and pretty
essential for anyone looking for a real overview of American rock
'n' roll.

COMMANDER IN CHIEF VS. FIRST MOURNER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   President Clinton did what he does best: He gushed empathy and
compassion in the aftermath of tragedy. Then he took a half-hearted
stab at a job he doesn't do very well at all: being commander in
chief.
</P>
<P>
   No president has played the role of ``first mourner'' with more
conviction and fervor than Clinton, and he was in peak form
yesterday when the bodies of 10 of the 12 Americans killed in the
U.S. embassy bombings in Africa arrived at Andrews Air Force Base
near Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton delivered a moving eulogy to the slain Americans and
watched at least part of the ceremony with tears streaming down his
cheeks. If the voters wanted someone who cries at funerals as their
top elected official, they certainly picked the right guy.
</P>
<P>
   We live in an era when it is considered mandatory for
politicians _ and everybody else, for that matter _ to wear their
hearts on their sleeves. Those who won't cry in public are
dismissed as lacking in compassion.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton may or may not be sincere when he indulges his penchant
for public displays of emotion, but many Americans clearly accept
such displays as evidence of his eagerness to feel their pain. In
two successful campaigns for president, Clinton probably garnered
more votes by shedding tears than most candidates rack up with
promises of world peace and full employment.
</P>
<P>
   He was at it again at Andrews as he voiced the nation's
appreciation for the bombing victims and concern for their loved
ones. He praised the ``adventurous spirit'' and ``generous soul''
of each victim. He comforted the survivors by reminding them that
no one can take away their cherished memories of those who died.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton is acting when he does this sort of thing, then he's
one heck of an actor. But whether or not his words and tears are
heartfelt, they are effective. They provide solace and support, not
just for those directly involved, but for the nation as a community
that has suffered a tragic loss.
</P>
<P>
   The current national sorrow, of course, is the result of
criminal acts of murder and destruction. The ever-present specter
of international terrorism has once again led to the heartbreaking
sight of flag-draped coffins carrying the bodies of murdered
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of such violent provocation, the American people
require more from their president than tears and sympathetic words.
</P>
<P>
   And so the president shifted gears and addressed the nation as
commander in chief.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter what it takes, we must find those responsible for
these evil acts and see that justice is done,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton vowed that America ``will not retreat from the world and
all its promise, nor shrink from our responsibility to stand
against terror and with the friends of freedom everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The words sounded great. But what would lead anyone _ including
terrorists who so brazenly target American citizens _ to believe
that Clinton's words had any meaning?
</P>
<P>
   What act of terrorism against the United States has Clinton
avenged with swift and effective military action? When has Clinton
made some outlaw nation pay a price for harboring and sponsoring
terrorists?

<P>
   When has Clinton followed through on any threat to ``stand
against terror''?
</P>
<P>
   We're talking about a president who can't even bring himself to
punish Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein for thwarting United
Nations-mandated weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam is as easy and juicy a target as any president could
want. If Clinton doesn't have the stomach to strike at Iraq, why
would he expect us to look upon his denunciations of terrorism as
anything but empty rhetoric?
</P>
<P>
   The world's terrorists must have laughed themselves silly as
they watched the tear-stained president of the United States
pretending to put them on notice.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's most ardent detractors are so busy being indignant
about his private behavior that they have apparently overlooked the
real ``high crime and misdemeanor'' of his presidency: his shameful
capitulation to America's enemies.

`AIR BUD' GAINS LITTLE YARDAGE WITH SEQUEL

<P>
   A dog couldn't play football in real life, of course.
</P>
<P>
   People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals would protest the
animal's endangerment, parents would scream for rabies shots, kids
would get fleas and the dog would make a mess on the field.
</P>
<P>
   But this isn't reality: It's a world where monkeys commandeer
ice cream trucks, parrots chant ``Show me the money!'' and dogs win
football games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Air Bud: Golden Receiver,'' the sequel to last year's
basketball-playing dog story, works only if you suspend your
disbelief, lower expectations and are in the third grade. ``Golden
Receiver'' has heart, but it's story is slight. Kids will marvel at
Buddy's football tricks, but they may be bored with the movie.
</P>
<P>
   The film picks up a year after the first (and more engaging)
``Air Bud'' ended. Buddy is a year older, and a year wiser. So is
his 13-year-old chum/owner, Josh Framm (Kevin Zegers again), who
spends his days playing basketball, hanging out with Buddy and
keeping his widowed mom from dating.
</P>
<P>
   Josh isn't a bad kid, just one who loves his deceased dad. But
when his mom (Cynthia Stevenson) falls for the town's veterinarian
(Gregory Harrison), Josh joins the junior high football team to
avoid seeing them together. The football team is terrible,
finishing last for several seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Josh's best friend is on the team, and the coach is a good guy,
so Josh laces up as the team's backup quarterback. Josh has a great
arm, just no confidence. Naturally, the team's all-star quarterback
gets hurt, and Josh has to step in. It's a good thing his dog knows
how to run a deep post pattern! Buddy runs onto the field, scores a
touchdown, and a sequel is born.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few clever sight gags, but the prevailing comic
theme is Buddy acting human. He opens doors, wears football jerseys
and celebrates touchdowns with paw-dropping dances. But that wears
thin, and eye pokes become the joke de jour. Giving Buddy human
characteristics is necessary to the story, but so is humor.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, at this point, director Richard Martin has
established a decent (if not abused) setup: Josh can't accept his
mom's new beau, and sports success might bring them together. Plus,
Buddy is a football dynamo.
</P>
<P>
   So why did Martin add Russian circus wranglers? Meant to be
comic foils (think ``Rocky and Bullwinkle's'' Natasha and Boris),
Natalya and Popov are instead terribly written sketches. Buddy
could have written better-developed characters.
</P>
<P>
   Natalya (Nora Dunn) is Cruella De Vil with a new accent. She
wants Buddy to be the main attraction in a traveling animal
carnival. So she and Popov buy an ice cream truck and try to kidnap
the wily golden retriever. Along the way, they trip over rocks,
fall in lakes and get hit in the head. The film doesn't really need
them and, consequently, ``Golden Receiver'' fumbles when Natalya
and Popov are forced into the storyline.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, back at the real movie, Buddy and Josh have become
football heroes, and Josh has even started to warm to his mom's
boyfriend. Josh and Buddy have led their hapless team to the state
championship, but Air Bud is kidnapped the night before the title
game.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with a little help from a vat of fish guts (don't ask),
Josh has to win the big game and save his canine friend.

FOR TEAM MANAGER, NO MORE DAMN YANKEES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEVE CAMPBELL  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Damn Yankees. That's what they were to Joe Torre when
he was young and growing up in Brooklyn and incapable of knowing
any better.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Yankees loomed over the baseball landscape _ as
impersonal as U.S. Steel, as pervasive as General Motors, as
ominous as the Communist threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember the Yankees teams in the '50s,'' Torre said. ``It
got boring to me. That was probably why I was never a Yankees fan.
I always said, `You're not a Yankees fan. You're a Yankee rooter.'
Because they were going to win every year.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre was sitting in the Yankees dugout of Yankee Stadium on
Thursday, wearing the Yankees pinstripes, the embodiment of what he
used to hate. After decade upon decade of looking up in envy,
longing to get to the World Series just once, Torre has managed to
accumulate an embarrassment of riches at his disposal.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees win almost every day. To keep it interesting, they
win almost every fathomable way.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are on schedule to win more games than any team this
century. Torre spent so many years playing, and then managing,
teams that ranged from miserable to middling, who'd have known he'd
have any idea what to do with prosperity?
</P>
<P>
   Even Torre didn't consider his managerial record a source of
particular pride when he arrived after the 1995 season. For the
record, it was 894-1,003. That's 109 games below .500.
</P>
<P>
   As of Thursday night, he was two games above .500.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really wasn't important to me,'' Torre said. ``What was
more important was being offered this job, and having a chance to
be accountable on a team that legitimately has a chance to win it.
A year like this has been magical. It's something that will always
be remembered.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' ability to get in a position to win, day after day,
would amaze Torre, if not for one thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you send a (quality) pitcher out there every day, why
not?'' Torre said. ``Why shouldn't we win today? That's what it
comes down to. We have a legitimate starter going out on the mound
every day.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Torre sent Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez to the
mound to face the second-highest scoring team in the major leagues.
Hernandez merely two-hit the Rangers for 8 1/3 innings, striking
out a Yankees rookie-record 13.
</P>
<P>
   And at the moment, Hernandez is the Yankees' No. 5 starter _ the
likely oddman out of the rotation once the playoffs start.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pitchers _ it just seems like they have this competition
going with each other,'' Torre said. ```Go out and pitch a good
one, and if I don't, I'm letting people down.' It just seems that
each guy takes a challenge every fifth day to give us a chance to
win. That's all we want.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By the time hitters get finished sifting through the arms and
legs and angles, they're hard-pressed to find the ball. Hernandez
is particularly hazardous to the mental health of right-handed
batters, who entered the game with a .144 average against him. He
retired the first 10 batters he faced, striking out five of them.
</P>
<P>
   The only threat Hernandez faced was in the fourth inning. A
one-out double byswitch-hitter Mark McLemore and a walk by
left-handed Rusty Greer brought up cleanup hitter Juan Gonzalez.
Hernandez fed Gonzalez a slider off the outside part of the plate.
Strike one. Hernandez fed Gonzalez another slider. Strike two.
Hernandez fed Gonzalez another slider. Strike three.
</P>
<P>
   Another lefty, Will Clark, walked to bring up Pudge Rodriguez
with the bases loaded. Rodriguez is a right-handed hitter, which is
to say he, too, struck out on a slider off the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fourth inning was a definite sign of what type of pitcher
he is,'' Rangers manager Johnny Oates said. ``It looked like he
knew who he wanted to pitch against. He knew he was going to go
after Juan and Pudge, and he wasn't got to mess around with Rusty
and Will.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez left in the ninth after a one-out walk by Gonzalez,
who had struck out the previous three at-bats. He left to a
standing ovation from the crowd of 53,835.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great support,'' Hernandez said. ``But to be honest with
you, I don't always listen to it. I always try to focus on what is
at hand.''
</P>
<P>
   For somebody who came over from Cuba on a raft in December, that
seems like a reasonable enough approach. It was the 11th time in 13
starts that Hernandez has worked at least six innings. Take away a
3 1/3-inning, 10-run bombing at Anaheim, and he has a 1.93 earned
run average.
</P>
<P>
   And he still might not be able to work his way past David Cone,
David Wells, Andy Pettitte and Hideki Irabu into the Yankees'
playoff rotation. The postseason is what it's about for these
Yankees. It's a different age, a different environment, from when
the Damn Yankees considered the World Series their birthright. The
Yankees made it to the World Series eight times in the 1950s,
missing in 1954 and 1959. Those were the days when a team went
straight from winning the pennant to the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a team must make it through two rounds of playoffs just to
get to the World Series. Torre already is fretting about the perils
that await in a best-of- five, first-round playoff series. A
best-of-seven format throughout the playoffs would make for more
justice, unless frostbite became a factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three series of seven (games) would be tough,'' Torre said.
``Unless they do it like the Super Bowl. Make the first two series
seven games, and the last one one game. How would that go?
Aaagghh!''
</P>

INFINITI G20 A MUCH IMPROVED LOW-END LUXURY MODEL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)  
 (For release Sunday, August 16, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN R.WHITE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the Japanese automakers took aim at the American luxury-car
market, they followed the dictum of an American general who had
advised ``Hit 'em where they ain't'' as sound strategy. And where
the Americans were absent in the luxury car battle was in the
fields of quality control and customer service.
</P>
<P>
   The pattern was repeated by Honda (Acura), Toyota (Lexus) and
Nissan (Infiniti). Don't just make a luxury Honda/Toyota/Nissan;
create a whole new luxury division, open separate showrooms and
dedicate the sales and service forces to customer satisfaction.
And, by the way, sell at a ridiculously low price while offering
ridiculously extravagant service so as to capture market share _
the Japanese understand market share.
</P>
<P>
   Dealers had to commit to new showrooms, lots of money and
training programs. But, dealers make a living on a complex
assortment of business _ used-car sales, service and repair,
aftermarket stuff _ not just new-car sales. In fact, for many, the
cutthroat competition for new-car business can thin gross profit
margins to a losing proposition. What to do?
</P>
<P>
   The answer for all three, it seems, was to become ``full-line''
divisions offering not just the top-drawer luxury boats _ the
Legend, Lexus and Q45 models _ but adding entry-level and
mid-priced luxury cars, sporty luxury cars ... you see the
oxymorons here? Entry-level luxury? Just what is that?
</P>
<P>
   A very real problem with this approach is that the low rungs
added to the luxury ladder tend to compete with the upper rungs of
the mother division _ Infiniti's G20, for example, is up against
Nissan's Maxima. It's cannibalism, creating another model line to
devour sales of the original line. The early G20 was pretty much a
well-dressed Sentra, something akin to what Cadillac Cimmarron was
to Chevy Cavalier.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the pitfalls, the Japanese made it work. Nissan has its
problems, but Nissan/Infiniti is still a major presence in the
American market. And the G20 is still around, too _ which brings us
to the point of all this.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not certain that the G20 is the answer to anybody's luxury
fantasies, but it is a vastly improved automobile over its earlier
incarnations, stylish, well-appointed, comfortable with a real back
seat. The performance is a wee bit anemic _ it is sadly eclipsed in
that department by its Nissan cousin, Maxima, which falls in the
same price range.
</P>
<P>
   The G20 for 1999 comes with a 140-horsepower, 16-valve,
2.0-liter I-4 engine coupled with a 5-speed, manual gearbox, and a
cloth interior for $20,995 nicely equipped. A fancier touring
model, the G20t, is $22,495 with manual shift _ all prices plus
$495 delivery. A four-speed automatic adds $800 to either model; a
leather package that includes a moonroof is $1,700 on the base,
$1,200 more on the G20t. Alone the moonroof is a $950 extra; heated
seats at $420 complete the option list.
</P>
<P>
   The new G20 may be ``entry level,'' but as an Infiniti it is no
bottom feeder. It at least looks like an Infiniti on the outside,
with a grille that proclaims its claim on the family name and nice
lines. You might even say it's elegant for a small car.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, there is no doubt about heritage, no mistake about the
luxury intent. The tested G20t was finished in leather, trimmed
with expensive veneer, abounding in small bits of elegance. But
what really made it for me was the rear _ it has room for adults
and underway does not induce mal de mer. That alone is a
significant improvement over the original effort.
</P>
<P>
   That original G20 of memory was a tight fit _ small door to
squeeze through, no kneeroom, not a lot of headroom, either. And
the suspension was tough, with the ride characteristic of a
buckboard or a Morgan _ stiff _ and a ``busy-ness'' that induced
nausea.
</P>
<P>
   So I made it a point to ride in the back of the new G20t that
Nissan insisted was ``much improved,'' albeit with a solid axle and
multilink rear suspension rather than the independent arrangement
used on other Nissan models. Maybe old stuff rides better than new
technology sometimes. For once, a car company was right to say
``much improved.'' The new G20 is a pleasant vehicle on a bad road
even after a big lunch, and there is decent legroom even with the
front seats pushed all the way rearward on the track.
</P>
<P>
   But much improved doesn't mean it's leapfrogged the competition
_ or even caught up. The G20t optioned approaches the other guys'
entry level models in appointments.
</P>
<P>
   Up front, gauges are clear, controls fairly well laid out _
although the radio does not have the knobs this columnist favors,
at least the buttons and bars were reasonably big. And it is a Bose
system with CD player and tape deck. Window switches and mirror
controls were handy.
</P>
<P>
   A small covered bin conceals removable cupholders; small glove
box, door bins, and seat pockets offer some interior storage. The
car comes with a fair-sized trunk, but the opening is a bit small
if you're contemplating bulky stuff. In addition to front air bags,
the G20 also comes with side air bags for a bit more protection and
4-wheel antilock brakes. So far, so good.
</P>
<P>
   The tested car came with a smooth, five-speed, manual transaxle,
but the engine is disappointingly tame, even with the stick.
Acceleration is OK, but don't bother trying to pass in fifth gear.
Think twice before attempting it in fourth. No, shift down to third
as you squeeze the pedal to the floor and demand everything it can
give _ which will be enough but not really impressive. The G20t
comes with a spoiler, an accouterment of performance, usually _ in
this case it might be considered false advertising.
</P>
<P>
   The handling is more than competent. This is no sports car, but
it corners well, grips the curves, proved nimble in traffic and
steady in evasive maneuvers. Fuel mileage was pretty good; the G20t
delivered 25.67 miles per gallon in varied driving over 675 miles
charted.
</P>
<P>
   Infiniti blathers on in the ads about European heritage, and one
supposes some people will buy into that, and a lot of them will
never know the difference. This is not a premier luxury/performance
sedan. The G20t is a taste of luxury, not the whole meal. It offers
an Infiniti badge at Nissan prices, comfort, room, style, good
handling and ride, and a bit more than adequate performance _
budget luxury.
</P>
<P>
   I give the G20t a thumbs up ... mostly. Understand that in the
G20 line Infiniti is promising a bit more than it really delivers _
and if you insist on getting that Euro-pizazz you thought was
promised, they'll offer you an I30.

   Once upon a time, Starr was appointed to investigate Whitewater.
He began to focus on whether Clinton and his friends had
orchestrated a cover-up of Whitewater.
</P>
<P>
   Then he acquired an additional scandal, Filegate, and began to
investigate whether Clinton had covered that up, too.
</P>
<P>
   Then he received Linda Tripp's tapes and zeroed in on whether
Clinton and Vernon Jordan had covered up an affair between Clinton
and Lewinsky in order to protect Clinton's cover-up of the Paula
Jones incident.
</P>
<P>
   Then Starr subpoenaed Jordan and Clinton's secretary, Betty
Currie, evidently to determine, among other things, whether Clinton
had conspired with them to cover up his conspiracy with Jordan to
cover up the Lewinsky affair in order to shield Clinton's cover-up
of the Jones incident.
</P>
<P>
   Then Starr subpoenaed Clinton adviser Sidney Blumenthal to
determine whether Blumenthal was orchestrating a smear campaign
against Starr in order to silence the investigation and thereby
cover up all the preceding cover-ups.

lawyers indicate Starr is now focusing on events subsequent to--and
designed to thwart--the Lewinsky investigation he launched in
mid-January. In other words, he is investigating a possible
cover-up of a possible cover-up of a possible cover-up of a
possible cover-up seemingly unrelated to the possible cover-ups
Starr had been investigating for four years.
</P>
<P>
   If, as the Washington Post reports, Starr now plans to issue a
report that omits all the material he was initially appointed to
investigate, the farce is complete.
</P>
<P>
   Well, almost. According to Associated Press sources, Thomason
``was warned early on by lawyers not to learn too much about the
president's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky because he might have to
testify about it.'' Were the lawyers keeping Thomason in the dark
in order to cover up the cover-ups of the cover-ups?
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the New York Times reports that by summoning Thomason
before the grand jury just as he was preparing to coach Clinton for
the latter's Aug. 17 testimony, ``prosecutors might have been
trying to send Thomason an ominous message--that they might summon
him to the courthouse again, to describe any new advice he
dispenses to the president.'' By this reasoning, whatever Clinton
does to defend himself against the charges of cover-up becomes part
of the cover-up.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Starr can prove these endless epicycles of conspiracy. But
he is paying a political price. It is becoming more and more
difficult to understand the offenses under investigation and why
the public should care about them. And if members of Congress can't
explain the report to their constituents, they won't impeach
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Not that I'm defending the president. I don't want a subpoena.

FORMER SOVIET SWIMMER PROSPERS UNDER THE STARS AND STRIPES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GWEN KNAPP  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLOVIS, Calif. _ The path to one American record started in a
Soviet Army pool. Lenny Krayzelburg started swimming there as a
little boy. At 10 years old, he was training at least five hours a
day, about as much as he does now as a 22-year-old world champion
with an endorsement deal.
</P>
<P>
   His teammates were his classmates. At the club, school and
swimming went together. Everything was carefully arranged to
cultivate athletic talent. But Krayzelburg never became a
state-sponsored star. Instead, he moved to the United States and
did things the hard way.
</P>
<P>
   For most of his teens, he barely practiced five hours a week,
much less a day. His family, starting over in a new country, had
little money. Krayzelburg had to work 30 hours a week at a
recreation center in West Hollywood. He took buses to the pool,
because his parents kept long hours in their new jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Even this week, while their son competes in the national
championships, his father is driving six hours round-trip, from Los
Angeles to Clovis, on the days that he swims.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, he saw Lenny win the 200, breaking his own
American record. Then he got into the car and drove home. As soon
as the championships end, the family will take a big trip together.
The Krayzelburgs are going back to their hometown, Odessa, in the
former Soviet republic of Ukraine. This will be their first trip
back since Christmas Day 1988, when they came to the United States
to find better opportunities for their children _ Lenny and his
sister, Marsha, now 20.
</P>
<P>
   Lenny remembers coming here and being overwhelmed by American
culture. ``The haircuts, the earrings, the tattoos,'' he said.
``They wear anything they want. In Russia, it is more conservative.
It's fascinating, but I don't know if I liked it.''
</P>
<P>
   He was thrown by visits to the supermarket, rows and rows of
foods, dozens of types of cereal in one aisle, meats in another. He
didn't speak any English when he arrived. Help came from neighbors
in West Hollywood, a hub of Russian immigrants. (The family
considers itself more Russian than Ukrainian.)
</P>
<P>
   In turn, when Lenny had learned English, he tutored some young
Russian girls in an after-school program at the recreation center.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a lot of countries in the world, America is the Promised
Land, but it's not as easy when you get here as you think when it's
overseas,'' Krayzelburg said.
</P>
<P>
   At home, the family still speaks Russian, and a satellite dish
brings Russian television into their townhouse in Studio City. His
mother, Yelena, has a job as a pharmaceutical technician, and Oleg
is a cook at a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   They are prospering compared with the early years, when they
lived in a two-bedroom apartment smaller than the one they had in
Odessa. This winter, they were able to travel with Lenny to
Australia for the world championships, watch him climb onto a medal
stand and receive two golds while ``The Star-Spangled Banner''
played.
</P>
<P>
   Krayzelburg became a U.S. citizen in 1995. His swimming career
had started to flourish. He went to Santa Monica City College for 2
1/2 years, and his coach there contacted Mark Schubert, the
University of Southern California coach, and asked him to take a
look at this promising young backstroker. Schubert started training
him in the summers, alongside 1996 Olympic gold medalist Brad
Bridgewater, and eventually, Krayzelburg got a scholarship to USC.
</P>
<P>
   Schubert has turned out national and Olympic champions at a
prolific rate. But he has never met one quite like Lenny
Krayzelburg. After Wednesday's races, he and Krayzelburg left the
pool together and stopped at a Boston Market for something to eat.
Lenny insisted on paying for the coach's dinner, as a token of
thanks. Schubert was touched and surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never had a swimmer buy me dinner at nationals,''
Schubert said. ``It's not something I expect at all, but when it
happens, you really appreciate it. It's very special.''
</P>
<P>
   Only a month ago, Krayzelburg signed his first professional
contract. He has to complete another semester of college for his
degree in finance and information systems, but his athletic
eligibility expired in the spring. Speedo gave him a contract, and
he asked for an unusual clause. If he makes it to the 2000
Olympics, his sponsor will pay for his family to fly to Sydney for
the Games.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Krayzelburg has noticed that most Americans aren't as
family-oriented as Russians. He doesn't quite understand why, but
he knows that being here doesn't prevent him from being anything he
wants, even a conservative young man with a nondescript haircut, a
soft Russian accent and a strong attachment to his parents.
</P>
<P>
   He appreciates the fact that no one ever taunted him when his
English was in its infancy, and that he ended up with a college
scholarship and a lucrative contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you work hard here,'' he said, ``the sky's the limit.''
</P>
<P>
   He had to work harder than most. If he had stayed in Odessa, who
can say what would have happened to his swimming career? Most of
the great athletic programs have been dismantled since the Soviet
system collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Popov, the great Russian sprinter, moved to Australia
to train.
</P>
<P>
   But even in this country, Krayzelburg thrived on his own for a
long time. In that sense, he is a classic American immigrant, and
indeed, the sky is his limit.

GETTING INTO THE MOVIE `GROOVE' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JEFF MILLAR 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``How Stella Got Her Groove Back'' is based on the novel by
Terry McMillan, who wrote ``Waiting to Exhale.'' But it's inferior
to the film taken from her earlier book.
</P>
<P>
   That one felt richer, this one feels thinner, perhaps because
``Exhale'' was more of an overview of contemporary African-American
women's issues, and there were simply more things set on our plate
to chew on.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair to its makers, richness of text isn't ``Stella's''
objective. It's a romance; any choice confronting filmmakers
between realism and glossy . . . well, the choice is never hard to
make.
</P>
<P>
   Still, what's best about the film is what feels the most
reality-based. And what's weakest is the gloss.
</P>
<P>
   Stella (Angela Bassett) is a hard-driving San Francisco
securities broker who has forgotten how to have fun. Upon shipping
her 11-year-old son off for a couple of weeks to visit her
ex-husband, she makes an impulse trip to Jamaica, taking along her
lifelong friend, Delilah (Whoopi Goldberg).
</P>
<P>
   The morning after her arrival, at breakfast, Stella sees at the
next table an attractive young Jamaican named Winston. The part was
cast with Taye Diggs, so impossibly handsome that he wrenched from
a theater full of adult women the noises usually confined to a
Hanson concert.
</P>
<P>
   Winston is young _ not that Stella is old. She's 40. Winston is
25, she guesses hopefully. Five years off. Winston is 20. That's 50
percent of Stella's age. That's HALF.
</P>
<P>
   The film enters a protracted loop of diminishing returns in
which their dialogue boils down to this:
</P>
<P>
   Stella: But our age difference.
</P>
<P>
   Winston: What difference does it make? I love you.
</P>
<P>
   Stella: But our age difference.
</P>
<P>
   Winston: What difference does it make? I love you.
</P>
<P>
   Stella: But our age difference.
</P>
<P>
   Winston: What difference does it make? Marry me.
</P>
<P>
   Before you rush to this as antidote for the recent spate of
geezers-get-the-girls movies, it has neither look or feel of the
Nicholson-gets-Hunt, Ford-gets-Heche, Beatty-gets-Berry movies. And
it's not the kind of role Meryl Streep has been recently demanding
on behalf of her actresses-of-a-certain-age peers.
</P>
<P>
   There is no gender-reversed, flab-vs.-firm dichotomy _ Bassett
turns 40 Sunday, but is buffer than Diggs. She occupies a Jerry
Rice 49ers jersey as well as Rice does. You really wonder what
she's talking about when Stella brings up the age difference. She
looks as good as he does.
</P>
<P>
   McMillan, who says she based the Stella-Winston relationship on
one of her own, doesn't make much of a case for the happy ending.
We get it, of course _ did you ever think we wouldn't? _ but we
don't get much sense of why we're getting it.
</P>
<P>
   More than a few filmmakers have shrugged shoulders over the
decades and said, ``Ah, l'amour'' as explanation for an unlikely
clinch at fade. It's just that explanations that feel based in the
real world, upon describable and ubiquitous experience, are more
satisfying. McMillan and screenplay collaborator Ron Bass have the
characters describe critical and explanatory scenes, but it would
be better to have the audience experience those events onscreen as
they happen.
</P>
<P>
   Director Kevin Rodney Sullivan brings his narrative to full stop
several times for embedded music videos considered crucial to the
film's marketing.
</P>
<P>
   The film's best moments come in the scenes between Bassett and
Goldberg. The filmmakers and Goldberg give meaning to a character
right out of the movie stockroom: Delilah is the standard
best-friend Listening Character, there to be an earlobe to the
interior dialogue in McMillan's book, to be Stella's coach and
cheerleader in the groove-retrieval process.
</P>
<P>
   The dialogue between them is warm and funny, and the actors'
playing of it evokes the immense value in the women's familiarity.
You might wish the film had been less about this age-difference
thing and more about these best girlfriends.

MOCK BATTLE WILL RE-CREATE ATTACK ON JAPANESE BUNKER IN PACIFIC
CAMPAIGN
</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREDERICKSBURG, Texas _ On Saturday, out behind the dollar store
and a couple of blocks from the antique shops in this Hill Country
town, a Japanese bunker will be destroyed by small arms fire and a
big burst from a flamethrower.
</P>
<P>
   It won't be a real battle, but Marvin Schroeder, the living
history coordinator for the Adm. Nimitz Museum and Historical
Center, promises that visitors will get to see an authentic World
War II assault, and they'll smell it as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something we can do that the movies can't,'' he said.
``We're already getting comments about the new Steven Spielberg
movie, ``Saving Private Ryan'' _ how realistic it is _ but at our
re-enactments you can feel the ground shake when the trucks come
in, and you can smell the diesel, the spent brass and the powder.
You can feel the heat of the flamethrower.''
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder and 35 members of his World War II re-enactment group
spread out across the state when the Spielberg movie opened last
month. They sent men dressed in World War II uniforms to theaters
in San Antonio, Austin and Houston. A group in the Dallas-Fort
Worth area did the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are kind of an anomaly,'' he said. ``Most groups do Indian
wars, the Civil War; not many people do anything from the 20th
century.''
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, 15 to 20 re-enactors will gather at the 2-acre
History Walk near the Fredricksburg museum northwest of San Antonio
for ``Island Assault: 1944.'' It will be the fourth, and final,
demonstration of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've made that 2 acres into a battlefield,'' Schroeder said.

   At the end of the History Walk, is a ``Fat Man'' atom bomb
casing.
</P>
<P>
   It shows that World War II brought us into the nuclear age,
Schroeder says.
</P>
<P>
   At 49, Schroeder has limited military experience. He spent a
year and a half in the Army, but when military doctors discovered
he had a steel pin in his wrist, they booted him out.
</P>
<P>
   Two brothers and his father were Marines. His family history,
plus the Nimitz Museum's emphasis on World War II's Pacific
battles, fed Schroeder's interest in the island-hopping campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The museum is a Texas Parks &AMP; Wildlife historical site.
</P>
<P>
   ``I created the living history side of the museum in 1986-87 as
a volunteer,'' he said. ``We began special event programming in
1990 when I got a job here. It took until 1994 to come up with a
base plan on how to teach World War II.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, he engineered a Marine landing on Galveston Island;
in 1995 he put together a ``Welcome Home Parade'' for veterans of
the war in the Pacific. ``That's something they never got after the
war,'' he said. More than 65 World War II vehicles were used in the
parade.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder insists that he and his re-enactors are not trying to
romanticize war. With children, he explained, they don't even talk
about war. They emphasize the equipment, the training, the living
and working together that takes place in a military unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teachers don't have time to teach this kind of history,'' he
said. ``Schools might have two days to teach World War II history.
The kids might come away learning a little about the atomic bomb,
the battleship Missouri, Normandy and some guy named Patton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope we can take up the slack for those teachers,'' he said.
``We just want to make people appreciate our heritage. You know
what they say about history _ we are doomed to repeat it, if we
forget it.''

   HOUSTON _ It's not the same as lifting weights or a swim at the
pool, but working in an office does burn calories. At the high end,
running an animated meeting in front of your boss burns off 188
calories an hour, according to Fitness magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, sitting through a boring office meeting lobs off
88.5 calories an hour. That may sound like a lot (go ahead and eat
that piece of chocolate cake!), but it's nothing like real
exercise: An hour's worth of swimming the breast stroke burns off
576 calories, an hour of running (assuming you're running a
nine-minute mile) expends 684 calories and baton twirling (this is
Texas, after all) uses up 486 calories per hour. But if your boss
frowns on baton twirling while you're on the phone, try these other
``low impact'' exercises while you're on the clock:
</P>
<P>
   _ Typing on the computer: 96 calories an hour.
</P>
<P>
   _ Writing a proposal by hand: 102 calories an hour.
</P>
<P>
   _ Photocopying and stapling or filing papers (both while
standing): 147.5 calories an hour.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cleaning up your desk and surrounding area: 177 calories an
hour.

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ In a musty World War II-era building on the
south side of Fort Worth, the legend of John Newton Means sits amid
tales of cowboys, presidents and astronauts.
</P>
<P>
   Means must have kept lawmen hopping around the Indian Territory
of present-day Oklahoma, according to information on the shelves of
the National Archives-Southwest Region facility. Records from the
1880s show three murder charges and several larceny indictments
against the rancher, who died in 1936.
</P>
<P>
   There is no evidence that Means was ever convicted, but the
documents researched by his descendants indicate that he may well
have been the outlaw folks said he was.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard the stories, but I didn't know whether to believe
them,'' said Means' grandson, J.B. Means of Ardmore, Okla.
</P>
<P>
   For more than 30 years, the National Archives center on West
Felix Street has been home to the Means family lore and other
federal treasures of Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico and
Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   But the documents may be moved out of state soon, depending on
whether the National Archives and Records Administration
consolidates collections and moves them to newer facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the country's 13 regional sites are running out of room
and are struggling to prevent pollutants from damaging records.
</P>
<P>
   In Fort Worth, the city has an interest in buying at least some
of the land around Felix Street from the federal government.
Negotiations have been ongoing for about 2 1/2 years, Assistant
City Manager Mike Groomer said.
</P>
<P>
   City officials say they like the location of the property and
believe that area businesses could generate jobs and help with
redevelopment. A land swap is also possible, Groomer said.
</P>
<P>
   The city's negotiations with the General Services
Administration, the agency working as the federal real estate
broker, will not affect the agency's decision about what to do with
the Southwest records. The agency is about a year away from a
decision, but officials have assured genealogists that census and
other crucial research records will stay in Fort Worth, even if the
stacks of original documents do not. But many remain concerned.
</P>
<P>
   Among the records housed in Fort Worth are:
</P>
<P>
   A document dated May 7, 1934, indicting Bonnie Parker, Clyde C.
Barrow and four others in the theft of four Browning automatic
rifles and 13 .45-caliber Colt automatic pistols from the Texas
National Guard Armory in Ranger, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   An official refusal by President Monroe to pardon 15 pirates
sentenced to death in the case of the United States vs. John
Defargues. Secretary of State John Quincy Adams also signed the
document.
</P>
<P>
   Several presidential pardons, complete with signature and seal,
piled on a shelf a few aisles away from the Apollo 11 flight plan.
President Harrison's 1890 pardon of convicted murderer George
Tobler and President Grant's 1875 act to reduce Oscar Snow's
sentence from death to life lie together in plastic film.
</P>
<P>
   ``A person could pick almost any topic that the federal
government got involved in in this region, and we'll have something
you can start to do research on,'' Southwest Region Director Kent
Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   RECORDS DATE TO 1806
</P>
<P>
   With 67,000 cubic feet of permanent records from about 90
federal agencies, the Fort Worth center is among the largest of the
13 regional archive holdings.
</P>
<P>
   About 70,000 to 80,000 cubic feet of records await transfer into
the permanent collection after a 25-year waiting period. Those
records should be in the temperature-controlled chamber even before
NARA takes official possession, Carter said, but there isn't enough
room.
</P>
<P>
   The oldest documents at the Fort Worth site are federal records
from New Orleans dated 1806. The newest papers of the permanent
collection are NASA flight plans.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the site's 1,600 visitors each month are genealogists.
Many argue that consolidating the Southwest records with those from
another part of the country would be an inconvenience.
</P>
<P>
   After Congress decides how many new or renovated facilities it
will fund, the politics of choosing the sites _ if the order is for
fewer than the current 13 _ will heat up, Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for the Fort Worth location emphasize the convenience
of Dallas/Fort Worth Airport, reasonable rent for the facility and
access to historians at local universities.
</P>
<P>
   The shortcoming of the Fort Worth facility and many of its
regional sister sites is the lack of a filtration system to keep
out pollution and harmful gases.
</P>
<P>
   When the Fort Worth facility was built, pollution wasn't the
problem it is today, Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   Original records are kept in acid-free folders and boxes, and
some documents and photos are kept in polyester film sleeves for
extra protection.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, original documents should be stored at 50 percent
relative humidity, at 65-70 degrees and away from sunlight,
ultraviolet rays or polluted air, Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   The building is equipped with smoke detectors and sprinklers
designed to dampen, but not soak, the document holdings.
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY ARTIFACTS IN STORAGE
</P>
<P>
   In Fort Worth, NARA's motto of ``ready access to essential
evidence'' does not apply to the disassembled Parkland Memorial
Hospital emergency room, where President Kennedy died on Nov. 22,
1963.
</P>
<P>
   Permission from the Assassination Records Review Board is
required _ and rarely granted _ to see the boxed-up floor and
ceiling tiles, cabinet, gurney and assorted medical instruments
from the Dallas hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The Kennedy Library did not want the materials, and the Sixth
Floor Museum in Dallas can't have them because it is not federally
owned, Carter said. They remain locked in a temperature-controlled
vault in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we threw it away, the conspiracy people would say, `See,
there was something in the trauma room that proves' '' a conspiracy
theory, Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   The information for which J.B. Means and his wife, Dolores, were
looking, however, was quite accessible. After narrowing their
search with information on the NARA Web site, they enlisted the
help of their sister-in-law, a genealogist in Fort Worth, to pore
over folders of yellowing court records filed under ``Means,
John.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the records on John Newton Means is a letter from James
Abel to a deputy U.S. marshal involved in a case in which Means was
accused of stealing cattle.
</P>
<P>
   Abel's connection is unknown, but the letter, dated June 1,
1889, reads: ``John Means has a bad reputation. ... He has been
stealing for some time and if you can do anything to get him to
justice you will do this country a favor.''

MAKING A MERGER WORK IN YOUR FAVOR 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By L.M. SIXEL 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ So, what do you do when your company announces it's
getting purchased by its competitor? Or maybe your company is the
big fish swallowing the guppy. How do you survive with your job
intact?
</P>
<P>
   You know the new company will need only one accounting
department and one human resources department and you hope like
crazy that your good performance will be so widely known that the
acquiring company retains your services, but don't bet on it. Many
employees sit on their hands when people they don't even know are
deciding whether they're on the ``stay'' or ``go'' list.
</P>
<P>
   It's a challenge many more employees are facing today. It's M&AMP;A
fever lately: 10 of the nation's biggest mergers and acquisitions
have occurred since November, according to Challenger, Gray &AMP;
Christmas, the outplacement firm in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, British Petroleum announced it was acquiring
Chicago-based Amoco Corp. and would shed 6,000 jobs, which has
employees of both firms nervous about their job security.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as you hear the news about a merger or acquisition, you
need to shore up relationships with people you know in both
companies, said John Challenger, executive vice president of the
outplacement firm. It's a lame duck period, when the folks at the
top are sorting out who will be the new leaders, and typically
people hire the folks they know. So try to get to know the
perceived players.
</P>
<P>
   You need people to stick up for you during those meetings when
employees' fates are decided, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Once the top bosses are identified, put a marketing campaign
into place, Challenger said. You've got to let the top dogs know
what you've done. Prepare a resume or list of accomplishments so
when you meet with the new leaders you can present yourself well.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the time to take a holiday, especially if you're
with the firm getting swallowed, he warned. Defer your vacation and
point out to your boss that you want to be on board in case you and
your data are needed.
</P>
<P>
   It's critical to keep a positive attitude about the acquisition,
said Greg Nakanishi, managing partner of GN Resources in Kingwood.
It's bad form for employees to grump around, complaining about the
deal and its effect on employees.
</P>
<P>
   Nine years ago, when Nakanishi was executive director of human
resources for Tenneco, he had the job of interviewing employees who
worked for companies that Tenneco had acquired. The Tenneco team
would ask officials from the companies it was buying to identify
its stars. Often, the ``stars'' then proceeded to trash the buyout
and complain that the buyer and seller had done a lousy job of
explaining the arrangement to employees.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, the acquiring company says: ``Hey, we can't have this
guy on our management team,'' Nakanishi said.
</P>
<P>
   The survivors were the ones who talked up the buyout, looked on
the positive side and help meld the two cultures, he said.
</P>
<P>
   That fearful, resentful attitude is a typical reaction to
change, he said. People worry about what effect the buyout will
have on them personally _ will they lose their job, how will they
provide for their family, will they still command respect in the
new organization?
</P>
<P>
   Typically, people focus on what they will lose, Nakanishi said.
That kind of attitude isn't exactly productivity-enhancing at a
time when their performance is being closely scrutinized by a new
boss.
</P>
<P>
   Caroline Osmon was a lucky merger survivor. She was in charge of
media relations for Memorial Healthcare System when the hospital
system announced it was merging with Hermann Hospital System of
Houston in November.
</P>
<P>
   The new vice president of corporate communication, who had come
from Hermann, was named almost immediately after the merger was
announced and Osmon got a chance to meet with him when the two
departments came together to design a new logo and image. She also
met with the new boss to explain how Memorial had run its media
relations office.
</P>
<P>
   Osmon said she didn't have much time to jockey for position
because the two communication departments were so busy and was
pleasantly surprised soon after the merger was announced when she
was tapped as the assistant director of corporate communications
for the newly combined Memorial Hermann Healthcare System.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone stayed on board, she said, although some job duties
changed. Osmon became a communication generalist for the new
system, a switch from her previous specialist role. She says she
enjoys her new, broader range of responsibilities.

FOR ALL THE POTENTIAL K'S OUT THERE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CECIL JOHNSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He hadn't watched one of the Sunday-morning talking heads shows
for weeks, having grown weary to his toenails of their fixation on
the Bill-Monica-Ken affair.
</P>
<P>
   But in light of the terrible events that had unfolded in Kenya
and Tanzania within the preceding 48 hours, the average,
semi-informed news junkie felt certain that the astute ladies and
gentlemen whose views he once took seriously might ponder and
pontificate about that horrible event.
</P>
<P>
   And to his delight, he was right. Although the terrorist attacks
on the American embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam _ with their
resulting deaths, grievous injuries and destruction _ sickened and
infuriated him, in a perverse way he welcomed the discussion.
</P>
<P>
   He (call him K for short) needed the rush of such superficial
repartee about something substantial.
</P>
<P>
   But quicker than you could say, ``Linda Tripp is just an average
person,'' the moderator found a way to segue all the way from Kenya
to the FBI laboratory where Monica Lewinsky's blue dress was taken
to be tested for traces of presidential semen.
</P>
<P>
   K swiftly switched channels and landed right in the middle of a
parallel discussion in the same universe of discourse.
</P>
<P>
   He really resented the network talk shows' insistence on
force-feeding him and other average news junkies a steady diet of
interminable rumination and speculation on whether the president
violated the sixth commandment in the White House with the
erstwhile intern and what ought to happen to him if he did.
</P>
<P>
   Quite frankly, it didn't matter to K whether the two consenting
adults carried out illicit sexual trysts, or even whether one or
both of them lied about it. It was, in his view, a trivial matter
that should never have been allowed to consume so much public
attention and money.
</P>
<P>
   K conceded, however, that if the tawdry affair forced Bill
Clinton out of office, it was the president's fault. It had been
within Clinton's power to end the whole boring business before the
oh-so-average Tripp provided Kenneth Starr with another direction
in which to slant his failed multimillion-dollar Whitewater witch
hunt.
</P>
<P>
   The republic, K concluded, would endure regardless of what
Clinton with his peccadillos and Starr with his McCarthyesque
antics did to the credibility of the office of the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he was as worried by all this as he was bored with
it. And it was not the fate of the president that concerned him. He
worried about those average Americans with whom Tripp so
inappropriately attempted to compare herself.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's investigation, he felt, made a mockery of due process.
The special prosecutor, in effect, targeted an individual and used
all the resources made available to him by the citizens and
taxpayers of the United States to find something with which to
prosecute or persecute him.
</P>
<P>
   It all reminded him of Franz Kafka's bizarre and terrifying
novel, ``The Trial,'' in which a man named K is put through
juridical and bureaucratic hell without ever being told what
offense he is supposed to have committed.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, it is the president of the United States who is
being put through the Kafkaesque ordeal. But the president has had
ample resources with which to defend himself.
</P>
<P>
   What, K speculated, if Clinton were an average American with
limited resources? And what about all of the average Americans who
have been dragged into the investigation and forced to hire
expensive legal counsel just to participate as witnesses?
</P>
<P>
   But beyond this specific case, he believed, Starr's
investigation set a perilous precedent that invited imitation by
prosecutors at all levels of jurisdiction. In fact, he knew people
who had been subjected to similar treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Such thoughts reinforced the news junkie's determination to
avoid the talking head shows for the duration of the White House
sex scandal. K was not just bored with the unseemly subject; it
also scared him breathless.

COLD COMFORT FOR COMPUTERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I have heard that computers need to operate in
a rather cool room.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cold Front
</P>
<P>
   DEAR COLD: Nonsense. If that were true, then mine would have
refused to operate long ago, what with all the black-light posters,
the beads and the waterbed.
</P>
<P>
   But if you want to talk temperature, that's a very different
matter. Generally speaking, if you're comfortable in the room, your
computer will be, too. If you haven't already thrown it out, your
owner's manual should give you the exact temperature range. For
example, my Pentium does best somewhere between 50 and 95 degrees
and can be stored anywhere between 40-below and 149 without any
damage.
</P>
<P>
   Trust me. If you're working in sub-50 conditions, you'll
probably do more damage trying to type with mittens on. Or, as I
said during last winter's cold snap, kkjdwp dm my ownegh thingz,
you know?
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: Open a Word document and type the sentence
``I'd like to kill Bill Gates.'' Highlight the entire sentence and
start up the thesaurus.
</P>
<P>
   _ Lots of Time to Kill
</P>
<P>
   DEAR LOTS: Yeah, looks like those merry pranksters in the
programming department pulled an all-nighter. Microsoft is
legendary for those sorts of ``Easter eggs,'' little jokes and
surprises tucked away deep in the bowels of otherwise stuffy,
businesslike applications, but they're not the only ones who do it.
It's just a natural way for programmers to rebel against being
chained to their cubicles for weeks before a product launches.
</P>
<P>
   If anybody has other stupid software tricks, send them in and
share them with the rest of the world, or at least the 15 or 16
people who read this column. We could all use a laugh, especially
with this Spice Girls breakup thing still so fresh in our minds.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, ``I'd like to see Bill Gates naked'' will produce
exactly the same result as that other sentence, although in the
history of mankind, this is the first time that phrase has ever
been used.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: When we start our computer, Windows 95 asks for
a password, which we use to prevent others from using it. If we
click the Cancel button, though, it starts up without any problem.
What is happening?
</P>
<P>
   _ Lock and Key
</P>
<P>
   DEAR LOCK: Using a Windows password may make you feel all secure
and James Bond-ish, but it really doesn't do any good unless you
tell your computer it has multiple users with different privileges.
</P>
<P>
   Go to Passwords in the Control Panel, then select the User
Profiles tab. Click on the second radio button, which allows
different users to customize their settings. Make sure you also
check the boxes that include desktop icons, Network Neighborhood
contents, the Start menu and program groups in the settings. Now
restart and log in using your password.
</P>
<P>
   When everything is set up the way you like, go to the Shutdown
menu and restart. This time, hit Cancel instead of entering a
password. You'll get the same desktop as you would with your
password; however, now you can start deleting shortcuts and
Programs menu entries, restricting access to your sensitive stuff.
Any time somebody hits Cancel from now on, they get the
plain-vanilla desktop.
</P>
<P>
   Remember that Windows was made to be friendly, not airtight.
Somebody who knows what they're doing can still get in. Your best
bet is to find some shareware that does a better of job of keeping
Windows shut or to use your computer's power-on password, if it has
one. -

HOME IS WHERE THE DISHES ARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Aug. 16)  
 (bl)  
 By FRANK DeCARO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's all my grandmother's fault, really. If she
hadn't bequeathed me the colorful plates on which she'd served
roast chicken and garlic potatoes every Sunday for years, I would
never have started. Her haul of Harlequin _ those pointy-handled
cousins of Fiesta ware that once sold for a pittance at Woolworth's
but now command top dollar at collectibles shows _ set me on the
path to collecting-heaven and storage-hell. Thanks to her china,
dishes have become my obsession.
</P>
<P>
   The box of yellow-and-white-flowered Cavalier ironstone that
matches my kitchen perfectly found its way home from a Brooklyn
sidewalk sale, where it cost $12. The 18-piece set of McCoy
Suburbia with its so-wrong-it's-right 1964 color scheme came from a
New Jersey antiques mall. The '50s squared-off gray plates with big
pink hibiscus flowers on them _ Bali Hai by Continental Kilns _ are
the spoils of an Atlanta weekend.
</P>
<P>
   My Tropical and Tahiti dinnerware _ sister patterns in pale
chartreuse decorated with dark green palms _ has been gathered from
flea markets, dish-ware shows and resale shops. Last week, I added
a service for four of this fabulous frond-ware from an Upper West
Side collector, who agreed to sell his overstock after years of
hounding from me.
</P>
<P>
   That's just my vintage inventory.
</P>
<P>
   My new dishes _ those that have not been ``previously
experienced'' _ are an assortment of '80s period items and '90s
eccentricities, stored in every drawer and cabinet in my Manhattan
apartment. I've got collage-patterned dessert dishes by the fashion
designer Gene Meyer, which look like his mod ties and speak of
mid-'90s retro fever. Just the other day, a set of white, Japanese,
crackle-finish dishes from Williams-Sonoma cried out to me from the
sale table, ``How gorgeous would we look with your Tahiti?''
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, plenty.
</P>
<P>
   Together, they're very now and very Zen _ pre-millennial
table-top calm.
</P>
<P>
   Not that I use any of them much. My dish collecting has little
to do with their actual employ. I haven't had a dinner party in
more than two years, and I eat most of my at-home meals out of the
containers in which they arrive.
</P>
<P>
   What has me hooked on dishes is the idea that someday I will
lead the wonderful life that will give me reason to use them. My
plethora of plates lets me fantasize about festivity, prosperity
and real estate. At nearly 36, I have everything I need to set up
house, except the house.
</P>
<P>
   My dishes let me dream of chic suppers on an exquisite urban
terrace overlooking something other than the black-tar roof next
door. In the weekend beach house I don't have, my virtual table
will be set with finery collected over years of travel. In these
porcelain-fueled flights of fancy, friends enjoy themselves,
celebrating their good fortune and our charmed lives together.
</P>
<P>
   When I bought a set of English bone china covered in spiraling
gold-leaf tendrils at the Barneys New York warehouse sale a year
ago, I imagined they'd be perfect if I had Tim Burton over for
Christmas dinner. I don't know him, but I am confident he'd love
these chic but slightly creepy dishes covered with my delicious but
highly caloric cooking.
</P>
<P>
   Although we joke about our obsession, those of us who collect
dishes take our penchant for place settings seriously. There is a
bit of madness behind the desire to collect a service for 40 of
Lu-Ray Pastels when you live in a New York apartment _ as one
couple I know has done _ but there is also something else.
Collecting an object so closely associated with family and
tradition is a way to establish a sense of security, a feeling of
sanctuary in an often hostile world.
</P>
<P>
   As John Pirman, an illustrator and a collector of vintage
Russell Wright and new Jonathan Adler ceramics, says, having the
right dishes ``makes me feel that my home is complete, like a big
family lives here, even though I'm single.''
</P>
<P>
   Setting a proper table lets many of us live down our unglamorous
pasts, too. Like so many suburban children in the '70s, I grew up
eating off Corelle, the ``living ware'' from Corning. Ringed in
blue cornflowers _ or worse, designs in harvest gold or avocado _
they were the leisure suits of dishes and lasted forever. You
couldn't break them if you tried, and I tried. There is some talk
that these hideous examples of technology over taste will be
collectible someday. Not by me. The settings I choose to collect
would make my grandmother _ and Martha Stewart _ proud.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, until I get that dream house, who has the room to store
any more?

OBSCURE LANGUAGES DYING AT ACCELERATED PACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By PAUL LEWIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the legend goes, when the Turkish sultan first heard of
Ubykh, the bizarre-sounding language spoken by Muslims who had
emigrated from the northwestern Caucasus in the mid-19th century,
he dispatched a servant to learn more.
</P>
<P>
   When he returned, the servant described what a language with 83
consonants and one vowel sounded like by taking out a bag of
pebbles and pouring them on the sultan's marble floor. ``Listen to
these sounds,'' he said. ``Foreigners can gain no greater
understanding of Ubykh speech.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, if people are curious about Ubykh, they can listen to a
recording instead of a handful of tumbling stones, but they still
can't hear it spoken in person. The last Ubykh speaker, Tevfik
Esenc, died in Turkey at the age of 88 in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Ubykh is one of hundreds of languages that are either dead or
dying; thousands more are expected to disappear over the next
century.
</P>
<P>
   For linguists, the growing number of vanishing languages is a
looming disaster that threatens to diminish the world's cultural
diversity and erase a monumental human achievement. ``Languages are
more than grammar,'' said Ken Hale, a linguist at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology. ``They are cultures, ways of thinking
about ourselves and our surroundings. When we lose one, it's like
losing the Louvre.''
</P>
<P>
   The disappearances are no less alarming, linguists argue, than
the threat the earth's biological diversity faces from industrial
pollution and population growth. ``Surely we linguists know and the
general public can sense that any language is a supreme achievement
of a uniquely human collective genius, as divine and endless a
mystery as a living organism,'' Michael Krauss, a linguist at the
University of Alaska, has written. ``Should we mourn the loss of
Eyak or Ubykh less than the loss of the panda or the California
condor?''
</P>
<P>
   According to the latest and most authoritative survey of the
world's tongues _ ``Ethnologue,'' published in 1996 by the Summer
Institute of Linguistics in Dallas _ 336 languages are ``nearly
extinct,'' meaning that parents no longer teach them to their
children.
</P>
<P>
   Among the recent disappearances, say linguists, are Northern
Pomo, a Californian Indian language; Sirenik Eskimo; Quinault,
spoken by Indians in Washington state; Kasabe, spoken in the
Adamawa province of Cameroon, and Ona, spoken in Tierra del Fuego
in southern Argentina. Eyak, an Alaskan language, is down to one
aging speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Krauss brought attention to the erosion of the world's language
diversity in 1992, when he predicted that at least half the world's
roughly 6,500 languages would become extinct during the next
century. That would mean a death rate of about 30 languages a year,
or more than two a month.
</P>
<P>
   Many languages have already died out, including those of major
civilizations, like Sumerian, Assyrian, Babylonian and Latin. But
today's more technologically connected world is hastening that
process. English and a handful of other major languages that
increasingly dominate the world are seen as linguistic passports to
education and a brighter economic future.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly half the world speaks one of ten mega-languages a
primary, or mother, tongue. Mandarin Chinese is spoken by 16
percent of the world's population, followed by English and Spanish
at 5 percent each; all varieties of Arabic at 4 percent; Hindi,
Portuguese, Bengali and Russian at 3 percent each, and French and
Japanese at 2 percent each, according to ``Ethnologue.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, 60 percent of all existing languages have 10,000
speakers or fewer, said David Harmon, who analyzed the
``Ethnologue'' survey and is a member of Terralingua, a society
dedicated to language preservation. These languages are highly
vulnerable to disruption.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Dorian, a Gaelic languages expert at Bryn Mawr College,
explained that ``when small linguistic communities become
economically unviable, for instance, they break up and the language
dies out.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, after Russia drove the roughly 50,000 Ubykh
speakers from their homes on the Black Sea into Turkey in the
1860s, they eventually decided that the dominant Turkish, Abkhaz or
Circassian languages would be more useful. Over time, they stopped
teaching their children their own ferociously difficult tongue.
</P>
<P>
   ``From what we know it was simply a decision by the Ubykh elders
not to teach Ubykh to the next generation,'' said George Hewitt, a
professor of Caucasian languages at London University. ``It seemed
more sensible to concentrate on languages they would need. But it
was a tragedy all the same because when a language dies a culture
dies with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bert Vaux, an expert on Turkish languages at Harvard University,
agreed. ``Every language offers a unique insight into the nature of
speech and thought,'' he said. Ubykh, along with other northwest
Caucasian languages, for example, had a unique system of agreement
between subject, verb, object and indirect object, Vaux said.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is cultural diversity the only loss. Luisa Maffi of
Terralingua said indigenous languages could play a role in
environmental preservation because they often contain valuable
ecological knowledge that enabled speakers to preserve their
habitats.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Spanish is killing Indian tongues in Latin America while
French is doing the same in its former African colonies. In
southeastern Alaska, parents have stopped teaching native languages
to their children, Nora Marks Dauenhauer and Richard Dauenhauer
wrote in ``Endangered Languages: Language Loss and Community
Response''(Cambridge University Press, 1998).
</P>
<P>
   English, it turns out, is the biggest language slayer. It was
the language of the Industrial Revolution, and remains the language
of the world's biggest economy and sole remaining superpower.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``It was always in the right place at the right time,'' said
David Crystal, a retired linguistics professor from Reading
University in Britain and author of ``English as a Global
Language'' (Cambridge University Press, 1997).
</P>
<P>
   Crystal estimated that 343 million people speak English as a
mother tongue; another 235 million to 350 million speak it well as
a second language because they learned it in a country like India,
where it has official status. Estimates of those who are learning
English as a foreign language vary wildly, between 100 million and
1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Crystal figures that the number of ``fluent to
reasonably competent'' English speakers is between 1.2 billion and
1.5 billion, compared with the world's 1.1 billion Chinese
speakers.
</P>
<P>
   English seems set to spread even further because it is the most
widely taught foreign language in over 100 countries including
Russia, China, Germany, Spain, Egypt and Brazil, sometimes
displacing other languages in the process, Crystal said. In 1996,
for example, Algeria replaced French with English as the chief
foreign language in its schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be,'' he concluded, ``that English, in some form or
another, will find itself in the service of the world forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the English of the future may sound quite different than it
does today, said David Graddol, another British linguist. In ``The
Future of English'' (British Council, 1997) he predicted that by
the year 2050 a majority of those speaking English would be native
speakers of other tongues, mainly Chinese, Hindi/Urdu, Spanish and
Arabic. ``Today's native speakers will have lost control of the
language,'' he said. ``We cannot tell what tomorrow's English will
be like.''
</P>
<P>
   As concern over the world's language losses increases, efforts
to record and revitalize endangered tongues are intensifying.
</P>
<P>
   For example, before he died, Esenc, the last Ubykh speaker,
allowed linguists to X-ray his speech organs while he was
demonstrating the vocal gymnastics necessary to produce those 83
distinct consonant sounds. He also helped scholars compile an Ubykh
dictionary and grammar guide.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, Congress passed legislation in 1990 and
1992 encouraging the preservation of American Indian languages. And
a privately financed Endangered Languages Fund, which gives grants
for the preservation and recording of threatened tongues, has been
set up at Yale University.
</P>
<P>
   Abroad, Tokyo University has created an International
Clearinghouse for Endangered Languages and UNESCO is cataloging
languages around the world. British linguists have established a
Foundation for Endangered Languages, which also provides grants for
the preservation and documentation of threatened languages.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain and Ireland, minor revivals are underway in such
endangered tongues as Breton, Provencal, Welsh, Irish and Scottish
Gaelic. Bilingual inhabitants of the Isle of Skye off the west
coast of Scotland, for example, can make a living writing English
subtitles for Gaelic television programs. In Belfast a group of
self-taught Irish speakers is trying to found an Irish-speaking
community by buying houses in the same street. And more than 200
people are now fluent in Cornish, although the last mother-tongue
speaker died at the end of the 18th century.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dorian pointed out that the collapse of the Yugoslavian
federation had strengthened the position of Slovenian by making it
the official language of an independent nation, while Croats and
Bosnians are trying to create separate languages for themselves out
of the Serbo-Croat they once claimed to speak along with Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   And in some case, new languages are gaining popularity. In Papua
New Guinea, Tok Pisin, originally a form of pidgin English, is
becoming a language in its own right. Yet as it does so, it is
replacing some of the country's other 800 languages.
</P>
<P>
   Organizations interested in preserving indigenous languages,
including Terralingua and International PEN, which represents
writers and translators, want to add a Universal Declaration of
Linguistic Rights _ creating a right to be educated in one's native
tongue _ to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights that the
United Nations adopted in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   But others argue that the disappearance of languages is
inevitable. Peter Ladefoged of the University of California at Los
Angeles has argued that linguists should record languages before
they disappear but not necessarily try to save them. Preserving
languages, he said, can impose political and economic costs by
weakening national unity and encouraging tribalism. It can also
absorb scarce resources that might otherwise be used for
development.
</P>
<P>
   Tanzania, he pointed out, promotes Swahili at the expense of
tribal languages in the hope of creating a sense of nationhood in
an ethnically diverse country.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of indigenous language and culture can be the price of
entering the modern world, Ladefoged said. He remembered when a
speaker of Dahalo, an almost extinct Cushitic language in rural
Kenya, smilingly revealed that his sons spoke only Swahili: ``He
was proud his sons had been to school and knew things he did not.
Who am I to say he was wrong?''

BOYS AND GIRLS MAKE MISTAKES; ONLY GIRLS PAY

<TEXT>
<P>
   Sometimes, no matter how hard you try, no matter how many things
you get right, life can be like a spelling bee. Make one mistake,
and you're disqualified.
</P>
<P>
   That's what happened recently to 17-year-olds Somer Chipman and
Chasity Glass. They took all the right classes, made the right
grades to get into the National Honor Society. Then they got
pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   Big mistake!
</P>
<P>
   Pregnant girls, even those with 3.9 and 3.7 grade-point
averages, aren't allowed membership in the National Honor Society.
Not at Grant County High School in Williamstown, Ky. No, girls
there who engage in premarital sex are not to be held up as role
models, no matter how much book smarts they have.
</P>
<P>
   Boys either, according to the admissions committee that
eliminated Somer and Chasity. But of course, boys can't get
pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   And therein lies the problem with the rule book. And that as the
American Civil Liberties Union has concluded, makes the girls'
rejection, among other things, an act of sex discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's making a girl wear a scarlet P and bear the burden for
something that is a joint activity,'' ACLU attorney Sara L.
Mandelbaum told ``The New York Times.'' ``No boy is being left out
of the society for having engaged in premarital sex.''
</P>
<P>
   Just when you think those awful days of dragging pregnant girls
before the altar to ask for forgiveness are long gone, you discover
things haven't changed, and a lawsuit is in order.
</P>
<P>
   Come to think of it, a spelling bee might have yielded better
results for Somer and Chasity. At least in a spelling bee, you can
ask questions about the derivation of the word stumping you and get
a straight answer.
</P>
<P>
   The young mothers were never officially told why they were the
only ones denied entry to the National Honor Society. When they
demanded an answer, they were told that they had not met the
criteria.
</P>
<P>
   Donald J. Ruberg, lawyer for the Grant County School Board of
Education, said that, given the fact that character is among the
criteria, the admissions committee did not feel that students who
had engaged in premarital sex should be held up for others to
emulate.
</P>
<P>
   You have to wonder if the admissions committee took some poll to
determine whether the other students were sexually active. And if
they didn't, how can they in good conscience eliminate Somer and
Chasity? After all, they have to know that not every sexually
active teen becomes pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   Somer and Chasity admit they were wrong to have engaged in
premarital sex, but they consider abortion far worse. Who can argue
with that? And who can argue that teen-age mothers who not only
remain in school, but excel, lack character?
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't give up my daughter for the world,'' Chasity was
quoted as saying. ``But I want to tell others how expensive it is,
how much work it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Let me hasten to say that teen-age pregnancy worries me as much
as the next person. And for all the obvious reasons, I wish every
teen could abstain from having sex until marriage. But when they
don't, none of us has the right to ostracize them, to tell them
they don't meet the criteria for being a role model, without
careful consideration of our own lives.
</P>
<P>
   When we do, life's missteps take on a whole other meaning for us
and our children. Rather than a spelling bee, where one error can
disqualify you, we get to live life like, well, baseball. No matter
who wins or loses, you get to try again next season.
</P>
<P>
   Somer and Chasity should be so lucky.

AFTER BUYING A COMPUTER, KEEP A 30-DAY PRICE WATCH 
</HEADLINE>
   By LONNIE BROWN   
 Lakeland (Fla.) Ledger   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   So, you've shopped around for that big-ticket home computer and
paid the money for it, or bought a new toy to hook up to one, or
have finally gotten a laptop with a screen larger than a postcard.
You bought it at the lowest price.
</P>
<P>
   Friend, your shopping trip is not over.
</P>
<P>
   You may still have 30 days left from the day of your purchase to
continue shopping for a lower price. And if you don't keep checking
prices, you could wind up paying more - possibly several hundreds
of dollars more - than you might have.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, my wallet is thicker with more than $300 worth of
20s and 50s, simply because I took the time to keep reading the
advertisements after I made my purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Big chains make the pledge that if the price drops within 30
days of your purchase, you can present the receipt of your
purchase. If you find it advertised at a lower price, bring the
competitor's ad in with the receipt. If it's in stock, you can have
the price difference refunded - and in some cases, 10 percent of
the difference to boot for your time.
</P>
<P>
   When a Toshiba Satellite 335CDS laptop was advertised for $2,000
(minus a penny to make it look less expensive), it was a drop in
the previous $2,200 asked for the machine. It was a good price for
a lot of computer.
</P>
<P>
   A Toshiba 2055CD Satellite laptop had served me well for several
years, but with only 12 megabytes of memory and a smallish hard
drive, it was unable to handle some of the tasks I wanted it to do.
</P>
<P>
   The 335CDS is a great little computer: Pentium 266 megaHertz; a
12.1-inch screen with vivid colors; 4.1 gigabyte hard drive; 56K
modem on a PCMCIA card; and a built-in CD and floppy drive. I've
come to like the feel of the Toshiba keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   The 335CDS, like the old laptop, has a cursor control that
sticks up from the middle of the keyboard. It looks something like
an eraser head on a pencil, and it works well enough. I had
expected I would have plugged in a regular mouse to use instead,
but the arrangement worked so well for me that I never bothered.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, I finally decided to buy the laptop. Office Depot
had it at the same price as everybody else: $2,000.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after the purchase, while looking through the computer
ads, there was the 335CDS in a competitor's ad: ``Price break!
$1,700.'' (That wasn't the exact price, but what's another penny
among friends?)
</P>
<P>
   Yep. By the time I got to the store, I didn't need the
advertisement from the competition to prove my point. Office Depot
had received notice from Toshiba of the price reduction and
refunded the difference.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, a friend of mine was telling me about a laptop
he'd just purchased. A Toshiba, with a 266-based Pentium processor.
He'd bought it at Circuit City about three or four weeks before and
paid $2,000 for it. I told him he'd better hurry back to Circuit
City and get his $300 back.
</P>
<P>
   He was unaware of the price reduction. He went to the store that
afternoon to ask about it. He got his money, but if he'd waited two
more days, he would have been past the 30-day ``we'll meet any
lower price'' guarantee offered by Computer City.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, this is the third or fourth time that I've
managed to recoup part of the purchase price of a computer or
related item through a price reduction. I've missed getting a
rebate on some items because the price dropped 40 or 50 days after
I made a purchase.
</P>
<P>
   (A friend of mine and I have a theory that manufacturers wait
until they receive our warranty cards in the mail, then at least 31
days later, drop the price of the item we purchased.) The $300
windfall was the biggest yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finding money'' like that isn't likely with any other consumer
product outside the computer industry. Everyday appliances like
washers and large refrigerators aren't in a highly competitive
market. Smaller electronic items like scanners and CD-ROM drives
don't have a lot of room to make price drops of hundreds of
dollars, although nobody will turn down getting a $10 or $20 bill
back should the price go lower.
</P>
<P>
   But desktop and laptop computers are becoming the hand-held
calculators of the 1970s: more powerful, smaller, faster and
cheaper. Prices are tumbling, partly because the strong U.S. dollar
affects the cost of products made overseas and partly because of
rapid reductions in the cost of components (random-access memory is
but a fraction of its cost a year or so ago).
</P>
<P>
   So don't stop shopping after the purchase is made. Take the
receipt, put it in a safe place, and mark the date 30 days away
from the date of the purchase on the calendar to return to the
store to check the price. During that period, watch the ads for the
same product.
</P>
<P>
   It's advice that pays off. In this most recent case, let me
count the ways - all 300 of them.
</P>

IN SEARCH OF A PATTERN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD NILSEN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - The human mind has an astonishing proclivity for
finding patterns. It is our greatest talent, perhaps a defining
one.
</P>
<P>
   Take any large string of events, items or tendencies, and the
brain will organize them and throw a story around them, creating
order even where none exists.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the night sky, for instance, a rattling jostle of
burning pinpoints. We find in that chaos the images of bears and
serpents, lions and bulls. Even those who no longer can find the
shape of a great bear can spot the Big Dipper. The outline seems
drawn in the sky with stars, yet the constellations have no actual
existence outside the order-creating human mind.
</P>
<P>
   Our own lives _ which are a complex tangle of events,
conflicting emotions and motives _ are too prodigal to fit into a
single coherent narrative, even the size of a Russian novel. Yet we
do so all the time, creating a sense of self as if we were writing
autobiographies and giving our lives a narrative shape that makes
them meaningful to us.
</P>
<P>
   We usually believe the narrative version of our lives actually
exists. Yet all of us could write an entirely different story by
stringing events together with a different emphasis.
</P>
<P>
   The question always arises: Are the patterns actually there in
life and nature, or do we create them in our heads and cast them
like a net over reality?
</P>
<P>
   The issue is central to a brilliant new movie by first-time
filmmaker Darren Aronofsky called ``Pi.'` In the film, a misfit
math genius is searching for the mathematical organizing principle
of the cosmos.
</P>
<P>
   His working hypotheses are simple:
</P>
<P>
   ``One: Mathematics is the language of nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two: Everything around us can be represented and understood
through numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three: If you graph the numbers of any system, patterns
emerge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Therefore: There are patterns everywhere in nature.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie's protagonist nearly drives himself nuts with his
search until he cannot bear his own obsession anymore.
</P>
<P>
   But the film also questions in a roundabout way whether the
patterns exist or not.
</P>
<P>
   When different number series _ each 216 digits long _ seem to be
important, an older colleague warns our hero that, once you begin
looking for a pattern, it seems to be everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   It's like when you buy a yellow Volkswagen and suddenly every
other car on the road is immediately a yellow VW. Nothing has
changed but your perception.
</P>
<P>
   Mathematicians find patterns in nature, yet math itself is
purely self-referential. It can only describe itself.
</P>
<P>
   As mathematician/philosopher Bertrand Russell put it:
``Mathematics may be defined as the subject in which we never know
what we are talking about nor whether what we are saying is true.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, ``one plus one equals two'' is no different from
saying ``a whale is not a fish.'' You have only spoken within a
closed system. ``A whale is not a fish'' tells us nothing about
whales but a lot about our language.
</P>
<P>
   It is a description of linguistic categories, not an
observational statement about existence. Biology can be organized
as a system of knowledge to make the sentence false _ indeed, at
other times in history a whale was a fish.
</P>
<P>
   ``One plus one'' likewise describes the system in which the
equation is true.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible to cast other patterns over reality. For
instance, artists understand perfectly well how ``one plus one
equals three.''
</P>
<P>
   That is, there is the one thing, the other thing and then the
two together: one sock, the other sock, and the pair of socks. That
is three things.
</P>
<P>
   In art, we constantly put one object up against another object
and observe the interaction between them. In that sense, one plus
one can equal three.
</P>
<P>
   When mathematicians say that numbers describe the world, they
are speaking metaphorically. Numbers do not, in fact, describe the
world. The patterns of numbers seem to mimic the patterns we
discern in nature and bear an analogical relation to them.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that this seems to happen so often may be little more
than the yellow VW effect.
</P>
<P>
   For experience is large and contains multitudes, even
infinities. In any very large set, patterns can be found.
</P>
<P>
   That is the trick behind numerology. If the name Ronald Wilson
Reagan can be turned numerologically into the symbol for Satan,
well, looked at another way, it can be turned into a recipe for
Cobb salad. All it takes is a system ingenious enough to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Even by its own terms, mathematics has trouble describing the
world. Some of the most common patterns in nature, for instance,
defy mathematical definition and can only be described by numbers
that are not, in fact, numbers.
</P>
<P>
   This is true from the double helix of DNA through the knobbly
whorls on a pine cone and up through the spiral arms of a galactic
nebula.
</P>
<P>
   Pi, for instance, was first defined as the fraction 22/7 but
even Pythagoras recognized that the ration was not precise. Pi, it
turns out, is an irrational number _ in other words, a number that
cannot be written as a number, a decimal of infinite extent.
</P>
<P>
   There are others, equally important. Phi, which describes the
decimal reduction of the golden section. It is also an irrational
number.
</P>
<P>
   To the Greeks, the golden section was the ratio ``AB is to BC as
BC is to AC.'' It also generates the Fibonacci series and is said
to define how nature makes spirals.
</P>
<P>
   Look at the end of a whelk shell, they say, or the longitudinal
section of a nautilus shell, and you will see the Fibonacci series
in action.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is not actually true. When you look at whelks, you find
spirals that approximate in different degrees of accuracy the
Fibonacci series, but never ever, except in the ideal world of
math, hit it dead on.
</P>
<P>
   Nature is varied; math is precise.
</P>
<P>
   Our hero in the film believes in the Fibonacci spiral: ``My new
hypothesis: If we're built from spirals while living in a giant
spiral, then is it possible that everything we put our hands to is
infused with the spiral?''
</P>
<P>
   He begins to sound more and more paranoid.
</P>
<P>
   And paranoia has been defined as a belief in a hidden order
behind the visible.
</P>
<P>
   Paranoia and idealism thus are siblings.
</P>
<P>
   There seems to be hard wiring in the human brain that makes us
cast patterns over the world. That hard wiring seems to bring forth
what Carl Jung called archetypes, that is, the narrative patterns
our brains spin out and the shape we then jigger all of actual
experience into.
</P>
<P>
   And when forced to choose between the coherent pattern and the
incoherent reality, we always choose the pattern.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps we could not live otherwise. But it makes me mistrust
idealism just as I mistrust mathematics. &QL;

   Say what you will about a deep dark tan, but for many it is this
season's vice of choice. With the consumption of luxuries _ and the
flaunting of a luxuriously pampered look _ at full throttle,
well-bronzed skin has a certain devil-may-care appeal, despite the
health risks.
</P>
<P>
   But if you must have the suntanned look, why not turn to the
large array of self-tanning creams, which allow the user to appear
heedlessly self-indulgent, without any actual damage?
</P>
<P>
   As a rule, men have been more reluctant to tangle with
self-tanning products than women have. That may be one factor in
why malignant melanoma, a skin cancer, is the most common form of
cancer diagnosed among white men between 35 and 39, according to
The New England Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Tellingly, it's often wives who first notice the signs and
insist that their husbands see a doctor, said Dr. Karyn Grossman, a
dermatologist who practices in Los Angeles and New York. Men may
resist self-tanning creams and lotions because, as Dr. Grossman put
it, ``guys think it's a girl thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Fellas _ get over it.
</P>
<P>
   Many people have resisted self-tanning potions in the belief
that the products leave an artificial orange cast to the skin, are
hard to apply and can stain clothing. But self-tanners have come a
long way since 1970s products like QT. Prestigious companies like
Chanel, Clarins, Lancome and Orlane entered the business a few
years ago, with much improved products.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the tan you can get without stepping outside is good
enough to fool a dermatologist. Products come in different shades
for different complexions. There are also lower-cost alternatives
from Neutrogena, Kiss My Face, Bain de Soleil and even that '70s
stalwart Sea &AMP; Ski.
</P>
<P>
   An array of creams, gels, mousses and sprays now make
application easier. Putting them on requires knowing two tricks.
First, use a lot _ after all, you wouldn't skimp on house paint.
Second, fill the sink with water and repeatedly wet your hands
while applying the stuff. No tell-tale streaks that way, because
the water dilutes the product and lets it go on more evenly.
</P>
<P>
   Self-tanners work by using a dye that provides no protection
from sunburn. But several products, like those from Chanel and
Clarins, also include a sun-blocking formula with an SPF of 6 or 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot to be said for having a tan,'' said Jean
Godfrey-June, the beauty director of Elle magazine and an avid
self-tanner. ``You look better, you look thinner, you look happier,
more rested and so on. If people tell me I look tired, I just put
on some self-tanner, and I'm just back from vacation.''
</P>
<P>
   The greatest problem with self-tanner today, she added, is
actually how well it works, since people are often horrified to
discover that a tan is fake, as they used to be when hair turned
out to be dyed. ``People somehow think that a self-tan is somehow
more vain than going out and getting a real tan,'' Ms. Godfrey-June
said. ``But I would be far more embarrassed about ending up burnt
to a leathery crisp in 30 years.''

HBO'S `BABE RUTH' FAILS TO SEPARATE THE MAN FROM THE MYTH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   My favorite Babe Ruth anecdote is the one about the 600-foot
home-run blast that lands in the exact spot where the rotund Ruth
pointed moments before that wayward pitch _ the upper deck of the
center-field bleachers.
</P>
<P>
   To argue this fact/myth with a Ruth connoisseur is often
pointless, possibly even life-threatening, and HBO's ``Babe Ruth''
(7 p.m. CDT Sunday) doesn't clear up the matter.
</P>
<P>
   It does, at the very least, offer grainy slo-mo footage of Ruth
gesturing in some way to left field. But it looks as though he's
telling some overzealous patron to sit down and shut up, which
might actually be closer to the truth because Ruth was also known
for possessing a healthy supply of crude arrogance.
</P>
<P>
   Author Jean Shepherd, one of many talking heads spewing Ruthisms
during the hour, asks, ``What's the fuss?'' _ that the Babe's
point-and-hit is ``a harmless little myth'' and, besides, ``a lot
of people believe in Santa Claus.''
</P>
<P>
   Someone ought to tell Shepherd that Santa Claus really IS a
myth.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Babe Ruth, whose baseball statistics really are
astonishing, has been a victim of his own legend, a man whose
contributions will always be debated and questioned and
exaggerated, like Satchel Paige and those Negro Leaguers whose
extraordinary exploits grow with every retold account. (The story
of a player being able to catch his own fly ball hit to deep center
field is one.) Reality, it seems, evaporates as the myth becomes
truth.
</P>
<P>
   Like drunken barflies making up stories as they go, the
sportswriters, authors and others who offer up Ruthisms here are a
lively bunch. ``Babe Ruth,'' then, ought to be viewed as an
entertaining tribute, not a fully annotated study, if it is to be
digested without disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   There's a lot of ``He was a living man who became a mythic god
and nothing can change that,'' and ``To me the Babe is still alive;
he is truly like Shakespeare _ he'll never die,'' and ``The truth
is that Ruth is bigger than the myth.'' Faces zip on and off the
screen, usually gray-haired fellas in fedoras leaning next to
typewriters, some fighting back tears when spinning their favorite,
personal Ruth tale.
</P>
<P>
   One sportswriter put this worship reportage in perspective by
claiming that the publicity-loving Ruth had a jovial nature when
meeting with the press and could make each media scribe feel
special. ``It was like writing about a friend,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   This relationship played so well with newspaper beat writers and
radio reporters that they would never reveal a discouraging word
about the Babe, even though he was quite the boozer and womanizer.
His uncultured ways were ``cute,'' although reporters appeared to
be less forgiving of other players.
</P>
<P>
   In actuality, Ruth was a complex mix of crudeness and inner
turmoil, a personality formed without discipline. Growing up in
Baltimore, Ruth was such a little terror that his father, a saloon
keeper, shipped him off to reform school at age 8. This is about as
psychologically deep as ``Babe Ruth'' gets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Babe Ruth'' does make mention of Ruth's inability to manage
family, though. He was married at age 19 to a 16-year-old, but he
tired of that union when his career with the Boston Red Sox took
off.
</P>
<P>
   He abandoned his family (they adopted a daughter) due to ``the
temptations of fame and fortune. He devoured food, sex and fun,''
says the narrator, ``living up to his reputation.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruth used to have his female ``visitations'' in the morning
before ballgames. Another myth involved a woman who supposedly made
her way to the dugout with a gun, firing shots at the Babe but
missing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Babe Ruth,'' produced by Ross Greenburg and Rick Bernstein,
doesn't attempt to separate Ruth's artistry from his celebrity,
even though it is central to his place in baseball. This often
throws the documentary out of balance, but does not make it devoid
of merit.
</P>
<P>
   By far the best things about ``Babe Ruth'' are the still photos
and motion-camera footage, covering ground from Ruth's days as a
star pitcher in Boston to his glory days in New York, to his public
funeral procession. Many of his towering homers are shown, and the
most moving footage shows how baseball, like any business, has its
share of coldheartedness. As Ruth's skills diminished, the Yankees
pushed him out the door. He'd return at age 40, lured by
``promises'' of being a manager, only to be used as a gate
attraction.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth is shown as a spokesman for Ford and other products,
playing mock ``games'' like a used-up prizefighter.
</P>
<P>
   A frail Ruth died of cancer in 1948, and it's not until you see
these photos, showing a humbled, dejected Ruth, that you can
separate man from sport. -
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere this week:
</P>
<P>
   ``The Smart Guy'' was more effective on the same topic in a
half-hour episode, but the two-hour ``Every Mother's Worst Fear''
(8 p.m. CDT Wednesday on USA) has its moments in dramatizing the
creepy side of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl Ladd and her real-life daughter, Jordan, are mother and
daughter here, Connie and Martha Hoagland. Martha falls into ``a
real cool'' chat room only to be tricked into traveling to another
city, where she faces a psychopath. Things only get worse from
there.
</P>
<P>
   After the FBI become convinced that Martha is a runaway and not
a kidnapping victim, they bail, leaving Connie to track down her
daughter on her own, ending with a climactic, dragged-out tussle.
</P>
<P>
   Predictable and often corny, ``Every Mother's Worst Fear''
blames divorced parents and working moms for Martha's Internet
obsession, spending far too much time explaining what it's trying
to say: Kids, be careful. As one terrified mother says after seeing
``date'' chats where teens simulate having sex, ``I never knew
there were chats like this!'' ...

BANK MERGER MEANS JACKPOT FOR SOME PARTING EXECUTIVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By VICTORIA COLLIVER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ One of the severance packages doled out in the
fallout over the proposed merger of BankAmerica Corp. and
NationsBank Corp. merger could cover the $10 monthly checking
charge for 2.3 million account holders for a year.
</P>
<P>
   ... Or pay the $25 annual fee for 920,000 credit card customers.
</P>
<P>
   ... Or pay the yearly salaries of about 80 tellers.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how you slice it, a $23 million severance package is a
lot of money.
</P>
<P>
   According to human resource and compensation experts, packages
in excess of $10 million and $20 million are becoming the
going-away rate for a top executive these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at the numbers, they may seem staggering, but
they are not inconsistent with the industry,'' said Gregory Green,
a Santa Fe, N.M.-based vice president for the outplacement firm
Challenger, Gray and Christmas. ``Everyone in this business at this
level creates golden parachutes for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Although regulators still must approve the $57.9 billion merger
of San Francisco-based Bank of America and the Charlotte,
N.C.-based NationsBank, the deal has already cost several top Bank
of America executives their jobs. Four of the bank's top seven
executives are packing up. But they will hardly be walking away
empty-handed.
</P>
<P>
   H. Eugene Lockhart, 48, who left his position as chief executive
with MasterCard International to join the bank just 11 months
before the merger, will receive a severance package worth about $23
million. Lockhart's position for the combined bank, which covered
global retail banking, will be filled by a NationsBank executive.
</P>
<P>
   Martin A. Stein, vice chairman and director of technology and
operations, also is being displaced by a NationsBank executive.
Stein, 58, who has been with the bank eight years, will receive
three times his $1.95 million salary plus about $3.7 million in
restricted stock options for a total of $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   Also leaving are Bank of America's highest ranking woman,
47-year-old Kathleen J. Burke, head of human resources, and Jack L.
Meyers, 55, head of risk management. The bank did not disclose the
amount of their severance deals, but they are worth three years of
salary and bonuses plus options and stock.
</P>
<P>
   While Bank of America chief executive David Coulter, who will be
the No. 2 man at the united bank, said he is not planning to leave,
his employment contract would give him more than $30 million in
compensation if he leaves after the merger. He is expected to
replace NationsBank chief executive Hugh McColl Jr., 65, when
McColl retires.
</P>
<P>
   Bank of America officials said that they didn't know how many
bank employees would be leaving, but that they would have a clearer
idea when the merger is finalized, probably at the end of
September.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they are doing is looking at all of the functions and
choosing the best of the best for the new company,'' said Bank of
America spokesman Dennis Wyss.
</P>
<P>
   The top six positions at the combined bank are split evenly
between the San Francisco and Charlotte banks.

<P>
   Charles King of William M. Mercer Inc. in San Francisco, a human
resources and management consulting firm, said he did not expect
major layoffs among rank-and-file employees because the territories
of the two companies did not overlap. He said mid-level managers,
however, might be hit harder.
</P>
<P>
   As for the large-scale payouts, King said it was part of doing
business following a merger. ``There's only a tiny, tiny minority
of people who have the background, the track record and maneuvering
ability to put together that kind of deal,'' he said. ``They've
spent a lifetime earning the right to get this big payoff.''
</P>
<P>
   King said the parachutes were not shocking, considering the
combined company would have nearly $570 billion in assets. The
severance packages ``are not trivial, but very near trivial
considering the magnitude of the deal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bank of America is known for its generous executive compensation
agreements, said Frank Glassner, managing director of Compensation
Resource Group, a national executives compensation and benefits
consulting firm based in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Glassner said shareholders would revolt if they thought the
severance packages were too high, or high enough to jeopardize the
cost-saving benefits of the merger.
</P>
<P>
   And cases like that of Lockhart, who was with Bank of America
for less than a year, just underscore why it is important for
executives to negotiate strong employment agreements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Typically, one does not expect the company they have just
joined and given up solid employment opportunities for to get
bought within a year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But not all compensation experts thought the arrangements were
typical for top-level managers. Beverlee Rydel of Michigan-based TR
Human Resource Services, which specializes in negotiating severance
packages, said high-ranking executives rarely get more than $10
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shocking number,'' Rydel said in reaction to the Bank
of America figures. ``But severances are based on risks, and you
have to look at all the risks based on terminating someone at that
level.''

THAT CURIOUS ROLLS-ROYCE DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN R. WHITE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The automobile business gets curiouser and curiouser _ and the
curious cup this week goes to the new owners of Rolls-Royce ...
whoever they are.
</P>
<P>
   That venerable British company known for its exquisite
automobiles has been sold as only the British could do it _ not
just to the highest bidder but, apparently, to all the bidders.
Volkswagen gets the factory in Crewe and the Bentley rights; BMW,
the original buyer _ or so we thought _ gets ownership of the
Rolls-Royce trademark, which it will lend to VW until 2003(?), and
the stockholders of Vickers PLC get a pile of money _ except that
some of it will have to be invested in the new BMW company building
the Royce ... is this beginning to sound like a daytime soap?
</P>
<P>
   It started as a fairy tale. Once upon a time, a poor but honest
engineer, Henry Royce, disappointed with his French automobile that
kept breaking down, built a fine English car that ran so smoothly,
one could balance a penny on its bonnet whilst the engine were
running _ Henry left school at 10 to go to work, before the grammar
lessons ``took.'' That was 1904.
</P>
<P>
   Royce's great success was noticed by Charles Rolls, a wealthy
aristocrat in the business of selling those unreliable foreign
cars, and he immediately did what the rich do when they see a poor
bloke with a good thing _ he horned in. In 1906, the Rolls-Royce
company was launched (notice whose name went on the sign first).
</P>
<P>
   In 1910, Rolls achieved the dubious distinction of becoming the
first Englishman to be killed in an airplane crash.
</P>
<P>
   By 1914, the company was well established and began building
aircraft engines, which also proved successful. During World War I,
Lawrence of Arabia originated desert tank warfare with a fleet of
nine armored Rolls-Royce cars, thus establishing a long tradition
of Rolls-Royce sales in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   In 1931, Rolls-Royce acquired Bentley and two years later Royce
died. In World War II, Rolls built the famed Merlin engine that
powered the Supermarine Spitfire, Hawker Hurricane, and the North
American P-51. Postwar, Rolls became a power in aviation. And went
broke doing it.
</P>
<P>
   In 1971, in dire financial straits, the motor car and diesel
divisions survived as a public company, Rolls-Royce Motors; in
1980, that company merged with what is now Vickers PLC. In 1998,
the car company, once again in dire financial straits, was put on
the block by Vickers.
</P>
<P>
   BMW, the company that built the Luftwaffe engines that the
Spitfires were shooting at in the air war, was apparently the
successful bidder. A deal was announced. Volkswagen, builder of
Hitler's ``people's car'' and wings for Messerschmitt fighters,
slipped a higher bid under the back door, so to speak, and it was
announced that ``in the interest of Vickers stockholders'' _ more
dough _ Volkswagen would get the company.
</P>
<P>
   Here's where the story really gets weirdly complicated. Rolls
had decided that its engines could no longer pass muster in the
face of increasingly stringent pollution requirements, couldn't
afford to develop a new motor, and so had contracted for BMW
engines. When VW got Rolls, BMW said it would cancel the engine
contract. Suddenly, VW had a factory to produce engineless cars.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, the deal had never included the Rolls-Royce trademark _
Rolls-Royce Motor Co. leased its name from the mother corporation,
a holdover from previous restructuring. So, BMW bid $66 million and
bought the label _ it would build a new facility in Britain to put
a car under it. It was looking like the deal from hell. Orders for
Rolls-Royce cars plummeted.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, a good fairy has come to the rescue, disguised as a
golf bag _ the whole mess was reportedly ironed out on a golf
course. As the deal now stands, BMW gives its blessing to VW to use
the trademark and build the cars at Crewe until Dec. 31, 2002,
presumably when its new factory will be ready. BMW will continue to
build engines for the VW Royce. In 2003, BMW begins building
Rolls-Royce models in a new facility in England, and VW is limited
to Bentleys. According to Automotive News, VW at that time will
begin supplying Royce car bodies to the new BMW company.
</P>
<P>
   What's really weird is that these two archrivals will enter into
a joint marketing arrangement selling both cars through the
existing dealer networks. If you thought Chrysler-Daimler was
strange, this is really cuckoo.
</P>
<P>
   I guess the next question is: Will the Germans learn to like tea
and warm beer? And will they all live happily ever after?

   A recent column on driver ed prompted some mail and news of a
new driver ed opportunity. Sandy Stevens, driving trainer for
police academies and operator of an advanced driving school for
many years, has teamed up with an insurance company, Vermont Fire,
to offer real training to the novice driver.
</P>
<P>
   The program stems from the insurance company's unusual approach
to insuring young drivers: Don't gouge them for stiff premiums
until after an accident but offer them training to avoid mishaps.
Cost of the training session is $100, thanks to subsidies from the
insurance firm; similar courses go for $400-$500.
</P>
<P>
   For information, write to Sandy Stevens, PO Box 1122, Merrimack,
NH 03054.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, Stevens offers a videotape study course in driving
technique for $39.95 plus $4 shipping _ same address. No, you can't
learn to drive watching a tape, but it will sort out the good
information from the myths and start you thinking correctly.

   This spirited attack on the ``prejudice against our state''
comes at a peculiar time from Mrs. Clinton, who grew up in a
Chicago suburb and did not reside in Arkansas until after she
attended Wellesley College and Yale Law School. Just when they
could use the lift of home cookin' and the bracing air of the
Ozarks, the Clintons will soon decamp for Martha's Vineyard, a
crowded, expensive island off the coast of Massachusetts
geographically and culturally remote from Little Rock.
</P>
<P>
   There are those who say that Arkansas lacks diversity and
culture. To that, many loyal Razorbacks reply ``Bull Shoals!'' That
is the name of a 100,000-acre state park, a paradise for boating,
fishing, and picnics. For cultural diversity, there's a nice view
of the Boston Mountains. And how can Nantucket Sound compete with
Lake Ouachita?
</P>
<P>
   Martha's Vineyard features gourmet ice cream, but by skipping an
Arkansas August, the first family will miss the annual Watermelon
Fest in the president's hometown of Hope, not to mention the Great
Arkansas Pig-Out in Morrilton and Mosquito Awareness Weekend in
Prescott.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has always been a restless sort. From Hope, he went to
Hot Springs, Georgetown University, Yale Law School, and Oxford
University. His striving makes him seem more Oxford than Ozark.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he owes no particular obligation to the Arkansas tourist
business. No one can begrudge him his vacation choice. It's not an
election year, and his former image-shaper, Dick Morris, can't urge
all-American camping in Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   Any president's vacation gives a clue as to his retirement
plans. In this respect, Massachusetts loses to California. This
president comes here as often as other people go to the post
office. He was in San Francisco last week, and when he comes again,
the board of elections will be ready to register him to vote.
Recreational fund-raising is to him what flyfishing was to Herbert
Hoover and Jimmy Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Among recent presidents, most have returned home. George Bush is
in Texas, while summering in Maine. Ronald Reagan is in California,
and Jimmy Carter is in Georgia. But Gerald Ford does not live in
Michigan, which he served in Congress for 24 years. He divides his
time between California and Colorado. Calvin Coolidge, now enjoying
an overdue reappraisal, loved his native New England, but also
liked summer in the Black Hills of South Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   The dilemma for the Arkansas tourist business can be solved by
advertising. ``The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn'' relates the
troubles of a traveling show, of which Mark Twain's character says:
``So the duke said these Arkansaw lunkheads couldn't come up to
Shakespeare; what they wanted was low comedy _ and maybe something
rather worse than low comedy, he reckoned.'' The duke then ``made
up some handbills for his show, with one line in capital letters:
`LADIES AND CHILDREN NOT ADMITTED.' `There,' says he, `if that line
don't fetch them, I don't know Arkansaw!'''
</P>
<P>
   According to the AAA guide, ``Mountain, delta, and prairie meet
in Arkansas. The blend makes the state a vacationland where
fashionable resorts are complemented by traditional backwood
lifestyles and a wide variety of recreational opportunities.
Renowned natural springs, sparkling lakes and streams, monuments of
frontier history, more than 2 million acres of National Forest
lands, six National Parks, and the only diamond mine in the country
that is open to the public give Arkansas diverse appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Traditional backwood lifestyles and a wide variety of
recreational opportunities?'' Well, if that line don't fetch them
tourists, I don't know Arkansaw.

METHODIST CHURCH'S BAN OF SAME-SEX CEREMONIES CHEERED, JEERED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM JONES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Conservatives gained important ground in one of America's
historic denominations this week when the United Methodist Church's
``supreme court'' affirmed as binding a ban on ministers performing
same-sex covenants for homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   The blunt effect of the ruling is that Methodist ministers who
conduct same-sex ceremonies can be defrocked.
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, the ruling elated Methodist conservatives. Liberals
were distressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a sad day for United Methodism,'' said Mark Bowman of
Chicago, director of a nationwide Reconciling Churches program for
some 150 congregations that reach out to gays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lesbian and gay persons continue to be second-class members of
United Methodist churches ...,'' Bowman said. ``They can sit in the
pew and give their money, but their loving relationships cannot be
recognized.''
</P>
<P>
   But United Methodist bishops who backed the ruling said it does
not mean that gays and lesbians are not welcome in the 9.5-million
member denomination. It simply proclaims the validity of a church
statement adopted by the General Conference, the church's highest
legislative body, the bishops said. Delegates adopted the ban in
1996 during a convention in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Debates have gone on since then as to whether the same-sex union
ban is advisory or mandatory.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute increased this year when the Rev. Jimmy Creech was
narrowly acquitted in a church trial in Nebraska after he conducted
a same-sex ceremony last year for a lesbian couple.
</P>
<P>
   Creech, then pastor of the First United Methodist Church of
Omaha, argued that the ban was advisory, because it appeared in the
Social Principles section of the Book of Discipline, the Methodist
book of rules. Social Principles, Creech said, traditionally have
been interpreted as advisory.
</P>
<P>
   But the nine-member United Methodist Judicial Council _ after a
two-day meeting in the Metroplex _ disagreed. They ruled that the
edict declaring ministers ``shall not'' conduct same-sex unions is
clearly a ban and has the force of law.
</P>
<P>
   Another advocate for gay rights, Kathryn Johnson of Washington,
D.C., president of the Methodist Federation for Social Action, said
her church is moving backward.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a time in history when gay and lesbian persons are gaining
... greater acceptance in society, it is tragic that the United
Methodist Church would be a place where they cannot experience full
acceptance,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative Methodists were buoyed by the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited,'' said the Rev. Dean Posey of Bedford, Texas.
``This issue has been debated a long time, and this ruling makes it
unquestionably clear what the position of the church is.''
</P>
<P>
   Posey said he hopes the decision means that the church of John
Wesley is moving back to its conservative roots and that it will
lead to strengthening the church's current stand against ordaining
gays.
</P>
<P>
   But the fight is not over, said James Heidinger, executive
director of Good News, a United Methodist conservative coalition
based in Wilmore, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether the many United Methodists who disagree
with the ruling will challenge it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that about 240 pastors signed a statement this year
saying they would conduct same-sex ceremonies if asked,'' Heidinger
said. ``I'm going to guess that someone will push a test case.''
</P>
<P>
   But those pastors will have to think twice before carrying out
their promise. If they defy the church edict, they could be without
a job.

ANCIENT EGYPT MOVES INTO NEW QUARTERS AT THE MFA 
</HEADLINE>

 By CHRISTINE TEMIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Egyptian and Ancient Near Eastern collections in
the Museum of Fine Arts used to be housed in quarters that
suggested ``The Mummy's Curse.'' They were either banished to
basement storage that was dark and dank or consigned to galleries
that weren't much better. Not very respectful treatment for a
collection that dates back to 1872, just two years after the
museum's founding, and ranks among the world's best.
</P>
<P>
   All that changes as of Saturday, Aug. 15, with the opening of
the museum's lavishly renovated galleries for this material. The
oldest objects in the MFA's collections now reside in the most
modern quarters in the whole museum complex.
</P>
<P>
   The galleries cost a bundle. The MFA acknowledges that, but
won't say exactly how much, only that a members' campaign raised
$1.2 million toward the overhaul. A particularly populist
fund-raiser _ more than 9,000 individual gifts, ranging from $5 to
$30,000 _ it reflects the popularity of these collections.
Everybody loves the mummies.
</P>
<P>
   The galleries were designed to prolong the life of objects
celebrating death _ objects from Egypt, a society obsessed with the
hereafter, and from the Ancient Near East, parts of which were
equally obsessed with mass murder. Or, as MFA curator Rita Freed
cheerfully puts it, ``Ancient Near Eastern art was about killing as
many people as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the 700 newly ensconced objects have never been on
public view before, and others have been hidden away for their own
protection. The MFA's mummies first enjoyed the luxury of climate
control during their appearance in the 1988 Gund Gallery show
``Mummies and Magic.'' They got spoiled. They couldn't stand the
strain of returning to MFA galleries where ``climate control''
meant electric fans and open windows, so they went to an area of
storage where (itals)real(unitals) climate control existed. Only
now are some of them surfacing again.
</P>
<P>
   One enormous 6th-century BC sarcophagus _ a black basalt monster
belonging to a general named Kheper-Re _ is not only surfacing, but
standing at attention. Meant to spend eternity in a prone position,
the sacophagus is now bolt upright. Authenticity has been
sacrificed for drama: The looming, dimly lit anthropomorphic
sculpture looks ready to cast a spell on you.
</P>
<P>
   At least the 2-ton sarcophagus won't fall on you _ not even in
an earthquake. Arthur Beale, the MFA's director of objects
conservation and scientific research, explains that extensive
earthquake precautions make the new galleries the place to be when
the Big One hits Boston. And it just might, warns Beale, adding
that there was a major quake here in the 18th century, and that the
museum's location on filled land makes it particularly vulnerable.
So, to rev up for the renovation, Beale headed to California to
study seismic retrofitting, and came back to oversee the building
of steel ``cocoons'' around each case in the new galleries.
</P>
<P>
   Another earthquake precaution: The stones in that ornately
carved 5-ton tomb wall are no longer resting on one another,
although they look as if they are. Each is now separately
suspended. In the event of an earthquake, they'll bounce, not
break.
</P>
<P>
   Fiber optic lighting, used more extensively here than anywhere
else in the museum, cuts the excess heat that can turn exhibit
cases into greenhouses, eliminates emissions that might endanger
fragile objects, and can be changed without opening exhibit cases
and disturbing their delicate environments. Silica gels in the
bases of the new cases control the humidity around artworks that
used to live in the desert.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the most advanced microclimates we've used in the
museum,'' says Beale. ``We've set a benchmark for all future
installations here.'' That benchmark has made walking out of the
new spaces and into the adjacent classical or Nubian galleries like
walking out of the First World and into the Third, where air
conditioning is but a dream, and August is sauna season.
</P>
<P>
   Beale's contributions to the new galleries are elaborate,
expensive, state-of-the-art _ and invisible. All that fiber optic
plastic and glass spaghetti, all those silica gels, are hidden
away, in the interest of creating an atmosphere akin to the tomb
scene in ``Aida'' for the Egyptian gallery, and a Cecil B. De
Mille-ish version of ancient Babylon in the one devoted to the
Ancient Near East.
</P>
<P>
   In these new spaces the MFA has signed on to the recent
museological trend toward galleries-as-stage-sets, especially in
the Ancient Near Eastern gallery, with its approximation of the
archways and ziggurat-shaped crenellations from the Great Ishtar
Gate in Babylon. The designers _ the architectural firm
Jung/Brannen Associates Inc., who worked with the MFA's in-house
team _ must have had fun coming up with details to help define the
Ancient Near East for Americans who are vague even on where it was.
Hence their cleverest stroke _ a map of the area made of colored
stones, embedded in the floor as if it were an ancient mosaic. A
single map can't show 6,000 years' worth of shifting borders, of
course, so this map doesn't have any _ just strategically placed
names of cities, countries, and bodies of water. Some, like
``Babylon'' and ``Ninevah,'' have a magical ring; occasionally,
there's a modern intrusion, as with ``Iran.'' The floor map also
saves valuable wall space, and is child-friendly: Freed expects to
see school groups sitting on the carpet beside it.
</P>
<P>
   Another curator might have installed an image with a come-hither
look at the entrance of a new gallery, to lure visitors in. Not
Freed. ``This is our banner,'' she says proudly, pointing to a
9th-century BC Assyrian stone relief of a demigod she pronounces
``a brute.'' This thug's role was to protect King Assurnasirpal II
from harm, by scaring off evil spirits. While he looks as if he's
been spending his days at Gold's Gym, the shallow carving that
defines his bulky contours is crisp, even dainty. Reliefs of
demigods once lined the halls of Assyrian palaces; in the 19th
century, though, Christian missionaries brought them back by the
cartload to Europe and America, not just for their aesthetic merit,
but for their Biblical associations as well.

   On one wall of the new gallery is a Babylonian lion, one of many
excavated by Germans who didn't have enough room to show them all,
so they sold off parts, including the one the MFA bought in the
1930s. It's made of bricks glazed in gold and turquoise, colors
that still sparkle in spots. The lion's mouth is wide open.
``Egyptian lions have closed mouths,'' Freed observes. ``But this
one is ready to chew.'' There's more chewing in a stone relief from
Persepolis, in which a lion chomps on the flank of a bull. However
gory the subject, the style is lyrical and rhythmic, and the lion
has a cuddly, overgrown pussycat look.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the aid of the map and the well-written wall texts,
most visitors will find the ``where's'' and ``when's'' of this
gallery confusing. (Freed suggests you start by remembering you're
looking at 6,000 years of history in an area 6,000 miles in
circumference.) But the objects themselves are so enchanting
they'll spur you on to learn more. They're arranged in
chronological rather than geographical order, starting with the
object that is possibly the oldest in the entire museum _ a stone
vessel in the shape of a sweet little bunny, which may date from as
early as 6400 BC. Sharing the same case is neolithic pottery from
southwest Turkey, painted with jazzy zigzag patterns that Art Deco
would borrow thousands of years later.
</P>
<P>
   Gold funerary jewelry from northwest coastal Turkey suggests you
can take it with you. The sleek designs _ spirals, twining rope,
animal heads _ may make you want to take these exquisite bracelets
and rings home with you instead. The MFA gift shop, big on selling
replicas, should take note.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most charming of all the objects here is a board game
dating from 2000-1500 BC. It involves pegs and holes, and although
it was popular from Egypt to Iran, contemporary archeologists can
only make educated guesses about its rules _ and about the
consequences for the loser.
</P>
<P>
   Across the room is a tiny amulet, just an inch or so high, which
would have been worn by a pregnant woman to ward off Lamashtu, a
particularly nasty demon in the habit of killing newborns. She's
shown here cackling with glee and carrying off the bribes the
mother-to-be has given her to go away: a comb and safety pin,
trinkets whose modesty suggests Lamashtu should up the ante.
</P>
<P>
   A corridor is lined with cases containing Ancient Near Eastern
coins, helmets, and jewelry including a single earring that was set
with 460 separate specks of semiprecious stones. There's also an
incense burner in the form of a dromedary, from the enigmatic
Nabataean civilization _ which Americans know from the Nabataean
capital, Petra, the red-rock city used as a setting for ``Raiders
of the Lost Ark.''
</P>
<P>
   That corridor leads to the new gallery for Egyptian funerary
arts, where you first encounter a mummification how-to, a case
filled with implements for procedures including pulling out the
brain through a corpse's nose. Turquoise faience canopic jars were
for storing the deceased's organs, although they look like
contemporary kitchen canisters where you'd keep flour and sugar.
There's a mummy tag, used ``so your grandmother didn't get mixed up
with someone else's,'' Freed explains, adding that there's no
record in ancient Egypt of the equivalent of the baby-switching you
hear about in American hospitals. (For those who can't get enough
of mummification, Robert Brier, the first person in 2,000 years to
mummify a cadaver in authentic Egyptian style, speaks at the MFA on
Oct. 29.)
</P>
<P>
   The new gallery's stars are, not surprisingly, the mummies,
along with their gorgeously painted coffins and their fleets of
shawabtis, the little fellows who did the dirty work for you in the
afterlife.
</P>
<P>
   While many of the MFA's Egyptian treasures came to the museum
early in this century, as a result of joint MFA-Harvard excavations
sanctioned by the Egyptian government, this new installation
includes recent loans, gifts, and purchases. Leveraged buyout king
Thomas Lee, cited recently by ARTnews as one of the world's top 200
collectors, has loaned a serenely beautiful mummy mask with
geometric patterns painted on a buttercup-yellow ground, the color
alone hinting at happiness in the Great Beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Freed was particularly pleased with a recent gift from the
Shackford family of Wellesley, who called Freed and said they
didn't want the responsibility of taking care of their papyrus
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``So,'' says Freed, ``I went out to Wellesley for tea and came
back with a fragment from the `Book of the Dead.''' It's a
particularly lovely fragment, with attenuated figures acting out
the Weighing of the Heart, the crucial test to see if you'd been
good enough in this life to qualify for bliss in the next. If you
flunked, you were fed to the crocodile-headed monster Ammit.
</P>
<P>
   For the Egyptians, death was just the beginning. For the MFA,
the Egyptian gallery is just the beginning of the long process of

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Just weeks ago, after many rounds of hard bargaining, the IMF
finally authorized a $22.6 billion loan package for Russia.
Meanwhile, the Russian markets have continued to plunge and the
fear that Russia would devalue the ruble is as strong as ever.
Despite initial optimism from the IMF, investors are apparently
still full of doubt, asking hard questions about progress before
they put their money into Russia.
 &HT;    Amid all this, the ordinary men and women on the street are
living day to day, trying to feed their children, often going for
weeks and months unpaid, despite holding, perhaps, two or three
jobs and exhausting themselves with work.
 &HT;    What is the problem here? Is Russia, as the president states,
really under control?
 &HT;    Other questions are being asked too both in Russia and the West:
Has the IMF done the right thing? Will the new IMF bailout affect
the Russian situation in a positive way? How can IMF money
influence the course of events in Russia?
 &HT;    At home and abroad, I am asked whether aid to Russia is
necessary and, if so, what kind of aid. Legitimate questions, all
of them.
 &HT;    It seems that the new monetary package is an endorsement of the
program of anti-crisis measures proposed by the government of Prime
Minister Kirienko. When presenting the plan to Parliament, the
prime minister said that the Cabinet was in effect charting a new
economic policy aimed above all at reviving production.
 &HT;    But it is already clear that the new economic policy is no more
than a mirage. The measures that the government has been able to
push through the Duma and the recent presidential decrees merely
introduce tougher fiscal policies in accordance with IMF
requirements.
 &HT;    Whatever modest steps were initially planned to stimulate
production _ the real economy _ have now been dropped from the
government's program. The tax burden is set to increase, most of it
falling on the beleaguered people. Hence, the too-small amounts of
real income and effective demand can be expected to shrink. With
tax pressures on business continuing to increase, economic growth
will not resume.
 &HT;    In today's global society, a total collapse of the Russian
economy would send tremors throughout the world. The old Cold War
thinking _ ``let them suffer, we will win'' _ has no place in this
world where boundaries are slim and we are one people.
 &HT;    If Russia and its partners are facing a dead end, this has
strong implications for the West, for Asia and for the rest of the
world.
 &HT;    What I believe is that the root causes of the crisis _ despite
Western bailouts _ lie in Russia. They lie in the flawed economic
policies pursued for seven years now with the West's support. These
policies have had a bad effect on Russia. They have discredited
democracy and magnified corruption, lawlessness and arbitrary rule.
They have allowed organized crime to penetrate ever deeper into the
bodies of government.
 &HT;    The point at issue is this: How long do we wait? Will the loans
save the day? Will they cause the inertia to be reversed?
 &HT;    In Russia, most analysts feel that the IMF package, based on the
pledges of the president and the Kirienko government, just like the
previous bailout in spring 1997, is bound to fail because it lacks
popular support. If so _ and the conclusion rings true _ what
should we expect? Moscow is awash with scenarios trying to predict
further developments.
 &HT;    If the president and his entourage continue to insist on a
flawed and unworkable economic program, it could ignite mass
protest. Currently, 90 percent of those polled think that a social
upheaval could erupt in Russia in the near future. It is quite
ominous and the events could go out of control. This is an
unacceptable scenario.
 &HT;    But there is a different course of action, which offers a
realistic alternative to chaos. I suggest that if the breathing
space allowed by the IMF loan _ we were told that it would allow us
a respite _ does exist, then it should be used as time to chart a
more or less orderly way out of the most dramatic phase of the
current crisis.
 &HT;    It is up to us to implement the reforms that best suit our own
circumstances. Our reforms are entirely our responsibility. We do
need support from other nations. I am, however, against handouts.
We need equal and mutually beneficial cooperation.
 &HT;    I believe we should have early presidential and parliamentary
elections, held simultaneously, this fall or early spring, to open
the way to a type of federal government that would have credibility
among a majority of the Russian people and thus be strong enough to
implement a program for ending Russia's crisis.
 &HT;    The president should call for these elections, and they should
be coupled with a referendum on certain sections of the
Constitution, in order to reallocate the powers of government
between the president, the cabinet and parliament. Russia's 1993
Constitution, which vested the president with unlimited powers, has
turned out to be both unworkable and dangerous.
 &HT;    It is a source of political instability, engendering
irresponsible behavior and confrontation between the branches of
government.
 &HT;    I also propose submitting to the referendum a constitutional
amendment creating a post of life-long senator for former
presidents after they leave office. Such an initiative would help
to ease this very dramatic moment, avoiding a dangerous division in
Russian society and assuring a democratic transition from one team
to another.
 &HT;    The time has come for the president to prove that Russia's
interests and stability and, above all, the interests of its people
are indeed his highest priority.

LEADING PHILOSOPHERS SUM UP THE CENTURY, SORT OF 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SARAH BOXER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The cameras flashed and clicked. People stood on
tip-toe to get a better look over the crowd. It was the last World
Philosophy Congress of the 20th century, and some of the most
important philosophers were onstage in the ballroom of the Marriott
Hotel in Boston: Willard Van Orman Quine, Peter Strawson and Donald
Davidson.
</P>
<P>
   You might have thought that Plato, Socrates and Aristotle
themselves had assembled for a symposium. When the cameras finally
stopped flashing, the philosophers blinked and trained their
thoughts on a single question: ``What have we learned from
philosophy in the 20th century?''
</P>
<P>
   The air fairly crackled with anticipation. Quick-witted Quine _
the 90-year-old Harvard philosopher who is the premier 20th-century
proponent of naturalism, the view that philosophy is a part of
science _ went first. ``I should have thought up an answer to that
one,'' he said. ``I'm going to have to pass.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone laughed, but he wasn't kidding. Indeed, all six
philosophers seemed to be confused about whether they were supposed
to give little speeches or take part in a roundtable discussion. So
Strawson, the 79-year-old Oxford metaphysician and philosopher of
logic, was up to bat. His plan was to focus on the ambiguity of the
word ``we.'' Is the question about what we have learned
collectively or what each of us has learned individually, he asked:
``If it's the former, the possibility of any reply seems remote.
And if it's the latter, there is no shortage of replies.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say, he added, you'll find any compelling answers
among them. People mistakenly believe that only the last two
decades of philosophy are worthy of attention, Strawson said.
</P>
<P>
   Truths may be hard to come by, but at least there are ironies to
savor. Strawson offered one: Plato is generally taken to be the
founder of philosophy and Descartes the founder of modern
philosophy. And yet these days, Strawson said, ``To accuse a
philosopher of Platonism or Cartesianism is a pretty serious
charge.''
</P>
<P>
   Davidson, an 81-year-old philosopher at Berkeley who has written
about the relationship between our identity as people and our
existence as physical objects, dodged the question. So instead, he
discussed how ``very American'' philosophy had been in the 20th
century, and then reconsidered: ``To be honest, it was mostly
Harvard.'' Today, he said approvingly, it's more international.
From there, he went on to talk about the merits of air travel and
e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   The big three had refused to answer the question. But they were
joined by three less famous philosophers who were not so shy.
Marjorie Grene, 88, a spunky philosopher of science at Virginia
Polytechnic Institute, briefly worried the word ``we,'' toyed with
tackling the word ``learned'' and finally decided she had more
substantial fish to fry: ``Why is it important to do mathematical
logic? Why?'' And why, she asked, is everything still Cartesian,
relying on Descartes' separation of the mechanical brain and the
incorporeal mind? ``The only true statement he made was that he was
born in 1596,'' she said, adding that even that might have been
wrong. She added that, by the way, ``Heidegger was evil and we
ought to forget him'' and that ethics is ``just minding everyone's
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Karl-Otto Apel, a Frankfurt philosopher who practices a brand of
philosophy that he threatens to call transcendental semiotics,
reminisced about his neo-Kantian days of abstract reflection on the
classic questions: Is there an outer world? Is reality a dream? Are
there other minds? With the rise of linguistic philosophy, these
questions, he said, became ``nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   But he now laments that reflection has been completely replaced
by infinite mathematical series: ``The only philosophical thing
left is `et cetera'.''
</P>
<P>
   At last, the end of the line had come. Seyyed Hossein Nasr, the
great American scholar of Islamic philosophy, skipped over the
chance to question whether ``we'' was a collective or individual
term in favor of asking whether it included Eastern philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take it this means American philosophy,'' he said, noting
that the West had virtually ignored the philosophical traditions of
India, China, Japan and Islam. If the West paid attention to the
East, he said, it would paradoxically rediscover its own traditions
_ not the latest logical formulations but the great spiritual
``quest for truth and meaning.''
</P>
<P>
   And so the original question had been torn to shreds. The
purveyors of logic and mathematics seemed to have ceded the floor
to those who promised to bring back spirituality and reflection.
But maybe this was just because not all the logicians were disposed
to ad-lib an answer to such a big question.
</P>
<P>
   As the night wore on, Quine was given a second chance. He
replied: ``I really have nothing to add.''

TOYOTA LAND CRUISER EASILY MAKES THE GRADE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB GOLFEN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - After jiggling, heaving and listing our way down a
long, steep, rocky trail, we discovered with much dismay that the
favorite camping site already was taken.
</P>
<P>
   There were about six tents and a bunch of jacked-up pickups
crammed onto our spot. And, ominously, strung between trees was a
huge black banner dedicated to Jack Daniel's whiskey.
</P>
<P>
   We moved on.
</P>
<P>
   The Toyota Land Cruiser had done a great job so far in all
respects: highway cruising, its new V-8 shrugging off mountain
grades despite its full cargo of gear and humans; smoothing out
corrugated dirt roads; and traversing a primitive trail over
boulders and ditches with surprising ease.
</P>
<P>
   But the big test was dead ahead.
</P>
<P>
   We were in a wilderness area north of Christopher Creek below
the Mogollon Rim in some of Arizona's rough country, and we knew of
another camping spot a mile farther down the trail. But we'd have
to endure a rugged stretch to get there.
</P>
<P>
   The trail looked hard and turned out to be as difficult as it
looked. I had to drive the Land Cruiser for about 50 yards through
a stream filled with loose rocks and deep holes, then jockey it
back and forth to get around some closely spaced boulders. After
that, we had to descend what seemed like a steep flight of steps
carved out of rock, then cross another portion of stream and climb
up a slippery mud bank.
</P>
<P>
   Midway through the proceedings, I began wondering whether this
was any way to treat a $50,000 vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   But really, it was a piece of cake, the Land Cruiser handling
the situation as easily as traversing a curb cut to the grocery
store.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, Toyota has produced a premium off-roader, a rugged
rock climber with the finesse of a luxury automobile, pampering the
occupants as it tames the terrain. Now, with the V-8 engine of a
Lexus LS400 under its hood, replacing the venerable straight six,
the Land Cruiser has the power and sophistication to deal with any
situation, whether a muddy jaunt into the woods or a cross-country
trip on the freeway.
</P>
<P>
   The Land Cruiser always has been top drawer among sport-utility
vehicles, close at the heels of the Range Rover. We felt at least
as pampered as British royalty in our Toyota, with its roomy, cushy
leather interior, booming stereo system and compliant suspension.
</P>
<P>
   We may have looked like a band of yuppie rangers in our
expensive four-by-four, but the Land Cruiser is certainly no poser.
It's as tough as they come, with its heavy ladder frame and rugged
four-wheel-drive system. The frame, beefed up with nine cross
members instead of six, was stiffened for this year.
</P>
<P>
   Land Cruiser just celebrated its 50th anniversary, when it
started out as a Japanese alternative to the U.S. Jeep and British
Land Rover. The fifth-generation 'Cruiser is longer and wider than
its predecessor, with sleeker styling. The look is slightly less
macho and broad-shouldered than before, but the muscle's still
there. Only more so.
</P>
<P>
   It may be looking good on the top of the heap, but now it's
priced way out of range for the common man, turned into a plaything
for the rich and a status symbol for social climbers. Still,
compared with the other high-end sports-utility vehicles making
their appearances in luxury-car showrooms, the Toyota offers more
substance and less window dressing.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a Lexus version, the LX4, which is basically the
same vehicle with a few more features slathered on and an
even-higher price tag. One notable feature of the LX4 is a system
that raises and lowers the ride height.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, the Land Cruiser has nearly 10 inches of clearance,
which turned out to be helpful on this journey. It's a shame that
so few of these expensive toys ever get off the asphalt, their
athletic ability relegated to duty as a glorified station wagon.
Sort of like a thoroughbred racehorse kept in the traces of a cart
pony.
</P>
<P>
   But for those who like to get down and dirty, the Land Cruiser
will not disappoint. The new V-8 is a major improvement, providing
18 more peak horsepower and 45 extra pound-feet of torque over last
year's in-line six. It's also considerably smoother, quieter, more
fuel efficient, produces fewer emissions and pulls the heavy sport
ute to 60 miles per hour in less than 10 seconds, fully two seconds
less than the six.
</P>
<P>
   That's progress. Still, the fuel economy is not so great, due to
the vehicle weight, typical in this thirsty class of vehicle. And
the handling, though impressive for such a tall vehicle, is not
nearly that of a passenger car. But those are the things one passes
up in favor of the macho appeal and off-road prowess of a major
sport ute.
</P>
<P>
   On the highway, the Land Cruiser cruises quietly and
competently. Hill climbing, passing and high-speed touring are
effortless, the big Lexus engine quietly providing strength and
motivation. My only complaint is that the steering feels distant
and numb.
</P>
<P>
   Because of its length, the Land Cruiser will accommodate a third
passenger seat in the rear, minivan style, just like the last
generation, making it a true eight-seater. With the rear seat
removed, space for gear and luggage is commodious. We had it packed
with a tent, sleeping bags and a ton of other junk needed to
survive and enjoy three days of family camping.
</P>
<P>
   No, we did not bring the Nintendo.
</P>
<P>
   The four-wheel-drive system is straightforward and easy to
deploy. There's also an advanced anti-lock braking system designed
for the rigors of off-road driving.
</P>
<P>
   As well as its impressive competence in any circumstance, the
Land Cruiser has another ace up its sleeve. Over the years, Land
Cruiser has gained a reputation for sterling reliability and
amazing longevity. Resale value stays high, and repeat customers
are frequent.
</P>
<P>
   For those fortunate enough to afford one, the Land Cruiser is a
rock-solid investment, and a lot more fun than the stock market.
Just don't forget to take it out for exercise somewhere off the
beaten path, where it can show off. &QL;

 &HT;    MONICA VS. BILL: THE WHOLE WORLD IS WATCHING, LIKE IT OR NOT
 &HT;    Moving in both the (i) International and (w) Washington
categories.

   MOSCOW _ A film critic for a Russian newspaper recently told his
readers to skip ``Primary Colors,'' the vaguely fictional
book-turned-movie about the Clinton White House, which has reached
cinemas here.
</P>
<P>
   Why spend your hard-earned rubles to see John Travolta as Bill
Clinton, he concluded, when the real thing on your television
screens is much more outlandish and entertaining?
</P>
<P>
   When the subject is Clinton's alleged sexual affair with Monica
Lewinsky, the whole world is watching, whether it wants to or not.
From the pages of Pravda to talk radio in Tel Aviv, months of
coverage has nestled the scandal into the global public
consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   Around the world, it is alternatively portrayed as a sensational
soap opera, a political tragedy or an American farce. It is the
story everyone loves to loathe, but like it or not gets more of,
particularly as Clinton prepares to deliver his grand jury
testimony on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Like Americans, the rest of the globe appears ambivalent about
the ultimate significance of the allegations and the potential
peril to Clinton should they prove true.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that our readers are more interested in the
political aspects,'' said Roberto Cespedes, chief of foreign
correspondents at Reforma, a Mexico City newspaper, ``rather than
knowing whether a dress has semen on it.''
</P>
<P>
   But rest assured that angle, too, has been reported around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Israel's largest newspaper, Yediot Aharanot,
published a five-page spread on the scandal in its weekend
magazine. The coverage was headlined ``Monica Sex,'' a word-play on
a popular Israeli rock band that coincidentally took that same name
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The section, which even included detailed profiles of Lewinsky's
parents, stated, ``All the world is poised, waiting to hear whether
President Clinton will admit to having had sexual relations.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps nowhere outside the United States has the tale been
splashed on news pages as abundantly as in Britain, with its
boisterous tabloids and competitive mainstream dailies. They have
joyfully and sometimes luridly reported every turn in the story,
very often on Page One.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Clinton Goes Down,'' screamed one recent headline in The
Sun.
</P>
<P>
   The alleged affair also has been frequent fodder for TV
commentators, who even have dwelled -- as perhaps only the very
proper British could -- on apropos women's fashion for a grand jury
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   One BBC analyst spent a considerable amount of air time on a
chat show expressing alarm that Lewinsky would carry a white purse
to her date with the grand jury. The commentator recanted later
when she learned that the handbag was actually a tasteful cream
color.
</P>
<P>
   For Russians, it is a somewhat amusing and bewildering saga,
regarded with interest but not fascination. Like many other
countries whose past political scandals have included murder and
brutality, they don't quite understand what all the fuss is about
over mere sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have our own important problems and mainly people think
that this is the private business of Bill Clinton,'' said Yuri
Levada, director of the Russian Center for Public Opinion and
Market Research.
</P>
<P>
   In Russia, male chauvinism is alive and well and sexual
harassment in the legal sense does not exist.
</P>
<P>
   The daily newspaper Izvestia carried an extensive article this
week defending Clinton against what it described as a gold-digging
horde of harlots, including Lewinsky, Paula Jones and others,
simply out to profit from their claimed sexual encounters -- or
near misses -- with the president.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's defenders range far and wide.
</P>
<P>
   The dean of Communist dictators, Cuba's Fidel Castro, said
recently that he sympathized with Clinton's situation, and that he
blamed Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., one of Castro's most-vocal
critics, for fomenting the charges against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In Jerusalem, where the politics of the Jewish-Arab divide
colors every issue, the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal reportedly is
affecting the peace process, too.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper Maariv reported Friday that Clinton has instructed
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to put public pressure on
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to give up land to the
Palestinians. But, Albright, according to the paper, is waiting for
the Lewinsky headlines to die down.
</P>
<P>
   For the French, who tend to be profoundly blase toward the idea
of an older man fooling around with a younger woman, the
Clinton-Lewinsky story has been treated as a grand farce.
</P>
<P>
   Le Monde commented wryly that even a full confession by Clinton
would amount only to a lie of ``Pinocchian proportions.''
</P>
<P>
   But in France as elsewhere, the serious fallout from the episode
also has been reported. The Lewinsky case is often portrayed as
Clinton's greatest personal crisis and speculation about his fall
has run rampant.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the world's media seem to appreciate what's at stake for
the American president if he is accused of perjury -- rather than
just having sex.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, there was the 1,000-word story this week in
the Scottish Daily Record, by a fashion writer reviewing Lewinsky's
wardrobe in her many public appearances to date. The story was
headlined: ``Looking Good: It Doesn't Cost Much To Catch The Roving
Eye Of The Most Powerful Man In The Western World.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems that Washington has displaced Hollywood as the world
capital of entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   The French daily Le Figaro expressed cynical frustration with
the whole episode. ``Wake up Washington and Jefferson,'' the
newspaper wrote. ``They've gone crazy.''
</P>
<P>

correspondents Bert Roughton, Jr., in London; Larry Kaplow in
Jerusalem; Susan Ferriss in Mexico City; and Shelley Emling in
Miami.)

   (For release Sunday, Aug. 16)  
 (bl)  
 By ALEX KUCZYNSKI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At 5 a.m. Friday, Rhonda Roenfeldt, 23, woke up in
Queens, put on a glittery tube top in metallic blue and a tube
skirt patterned with Indian goddesses and fitted a long black wig
over her red hair. She said she applied more makeup than usual,
using several coats of jet-black mascara, then gathered her head
shot and some sheet music and made her way to Manhattan to the open
casting call for ``And the Beat Goes On: The Sonny and Cher
Story,'' a made-for-television movie that will air on ABC in
February.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many of the bewigged Cher hopefuls, who stood in line
outside the Anne G. Wilder Theater on West 42nd Street, Ms.
Roenfeldt, who tends bar on Second Avenue in Manhattan, seemed
terrifyingly confident, projecting the defensive happiness and
high-beam smile of a fledgling actress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someday, I will be a very highly paid movie actress,'' she
said, her bold words somehow not meshing with a shy smile. In the
four-hour wait from her arrival in line to her audition, she had
befriended Maggie Gallagher, 29, a teacher from Manhattan, and
Sharon Allitt, a paralegal from Beachwood, N.J., and they both
nodded soberly in agreement. In homage to the Cher of the 1970s,
all three women wore midriff-baring tops, but in a distinct nod to
the '90s, all three exposed belly buttons were pierced.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Roenfeldt, the mother of a 2-year-old daughter, didn't
remember ever seeing Sonny and Cher when they were on television.
Ms. Gallagher wanted to sing ``If I Could Turn Back Time,'' and Ms.
Allitt was going for the big kahuna, ``Gypsies, Tramps and
Thieves.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the legions of rumpled nonprofessionals, the long hours
and the guaranteed tears of heartbroken amateurs, the open casting
call has worked for Larry Thompson, the project's producer.
Thompson _ who was a lawyer for both Sonny and Cher until their
divorce, after which he represented Sonny only _ also produced
``Lucy and Desi: Before the Laughter'' for CBS in 1991, and found
his actor and actress in a similar open call. Several hundred
people turned out for his recent auditions in Chicago, Los Angeles
and New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're making a movie about icons, people who are the
audience know what those icons look like,'' Thompson said. ``So if
you cast a star or a celebrity in the role of Sonny or Cher, it's
difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And the Beat Goes On'' is based on Sonny Bono's autobiography,
which was a fleeting best seller in 1991, and will depict the
couple's life together, from the moment they first met _ when
Salvatore Bono was a driver for a meat-packing company _ to the
period after their divorce.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would drive his truck down Hollywood Boulevard, stop at the
speciality record companies, rip off his bloody apron and start
pitching his songs with blood still on his shoes,'' said Maura
Dunbar, an ABC vice president, who oversees miniseries and special
projects.
</P>
<P>
   When Sonny was 28, he met 16-year-old Cherilyn Sarkisian
LaPierre, an aspiring singer so shy she was unable to sing by
herself. Together, they hit the charts, dropped off the charts and
had a baby. She bared her belly button, he wore fur vests and they
became symbols of the smiley-face '70s. They spawned four variety
shows: ``The Sonny and Cher Show'' was the first. After their
divorce, there was ``The Sonny Show,'' ``The Cher Show'' and then
``The Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour'' _ which Thompson calls ``The
Sonny and Cher Divorce Show.''
</P>
<P>
   Bono metamorphosed from campy crooner to restaurateur to Palm
Springs, Calif., Mayor to U.S. congressman, and died last January
in a skiing accident. His wife, Representative Mary Bono, is
cooperating with the film. Cher, who transformed herself from
pre-disco chanteuse to Oscar-winning actress to hawker of hair
products, is not.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not Thompson finds his Cher or Sonny among the
hundreds of people who auditioned for him, he succeeded in
generating a shudder of publicity for his made-for-television
movie. More than a half-dozen camera crews stuck their microphones
into the pancaked faces of the Cher wannabes. Stories went out
about the woman who drove nine hours from Missouri to get to the
Chicago auditions, and the middle-aged couple who perform a Sonny
and Cher act in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Entertainment Tonight,'' the nightly television magazine show,
followed actress Elizabeth York for two days before her Manhattan
audition, recording her every step.
</P>
<P>
   But the aspiring Sonnys and Chers displayed a consistent lack of
cynicism about the publicity stunt. ``Look, even if this thing is
already pre-cast, we don't care,'' Selena Cantor, a professional
singer, said. ``This is the way Broadway works. You get some
buzz.'' For her audition, she sang ``I Got You, Babe'' with Stephen
Morfesis, a reiki masseur she had met on line. (``It was a
four-hour romance,'' he said.) Despite Morfesis' toothy Bono-esque
smile and Ms. Cantor's resemblance to Cher, Thompson said the
dreaded words _ ``thank you'' _ before they finished.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. York, the actress tailed by the ET crew, said she felt
awkward about all the cameras _ but hey, that's show biz. ``I feel
like I'm being used, that it's just a manufactured event, sure, but
it's kind of what most actors do all the time anyway,'' she said.
``This role could have been cast months ago, and I'd still be here
today. I'm getting out there, do you know what I mean? And at least
I got a great outfit out of it,'' she added, pulling at her
lizard-print nylon pants suit, circa 1975.
</P>
<P>
   The auditions rolled. Thompson sat inside the darkened theater
listening to a relentless stream of women sing the first few lines
of ``I Got You, Babe.'' After vamping confidently in line for
hours, many of the women became inexplicably shy when they hit the
stage, their voices whittled down to a whisper. Suddenly, they were
standing in a dark room looking at bright lights and steely eyed
producers, no longer discussing itchy wigs outside in the safe
sunshine.
</P>
<P>
   Auditioner No. 19, Dina Nicki Rassias, stood on stage in her
striped tank dress, her arms goose-pimpled from the
air-conditioning, and spoke about why she wanted the part.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was growing up, I would watch Cher, and here I was this
little Greek-Romanian girl and she was this little Armenian girl,
and I thought, I can be beautiful, too, without being one of these
huge blond all-American beauties,'' she said, and started to sing.
Thompson said, ``Thank you.''
</P>
<P>
   At her audition, Ms. Gallagher, the teacher, belted out ``If I
Could Turn Back Time'' with exaggerated gutsiness, moving her lips
in distinctive Cher style. Thompson cut her off with a swift but
warm ``thank you.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside in the hallway, reunited with her temporary friends
again, Ms. Gallagher looked upset. Her lower lip trembled. She said
she wanted to get a drink. ``If only I hadn't cracked on that
note,'' she said, her face drawn. ``Maybe I would have had a
chance.''

   CALIFORNIA -- QUAKE. If the earthquake that startled San
Francisco residents this week had been of a far greater magnitude,
destroying homes instead of just knocking bottles off shelves, some
lawmakers would have wanted the federal government to foot the
bill. But instead of doling out the usual amount of disaster aid,
lawmakers say the federal government should establish a fund to
bolster state organizations like the California Earthquake
Authority, which back insurance policies that cover damage caused
by natural disasters. Maggi
</P>
<P>
   INDIANA -- VACATION. Since January, the U.S. House has been in
session 65 days and when they get back from their August recess,
they plan on wrapping up business by the middle of October, having
worked just 89 days. Wolfberg
</P>
<P>
   MARYLAND -- CAMPAIGNS. Democrat Ralph Neas ranks 20th out of the
top 50 House challengers for total contributions to his campaign in
his race against Republican incumbent Connie Morella. (Possible for
Wed.) Brown.
</P>
<P>
   MASSACHUSETTS -- VINEYARD. President Clinton will visit Martha's
Vineyard next week and local leaders want him to know there is more
to the island than a destination place for the rich and famous.
(Working-Will be filed early next week). Preston

   PENNSYLVANIA -- GUNS. Pennsylvania has more residents walking
the streets with concealed handguns than any other state in the
nation, according to a study by Handgun Control, Inc. There are
currently 575,000 residents licensed to carry a concealed gun in
Pennsylvania -- that's three-and-a-half times as many concealed
guns as in Texas. Kane

   VIRGIN ISLANDS -- ISLAND. Attention divers! Are you looking for
uncrowded, unspoiled coral reefs with a rainbow of vibrant colors
and alive with a diversity of plant and animal life? A team of
scientists from the Center for Marine Conservation has found such a
place in the middle of the Caribbean, between Haiti and Jamaica.
But there's a catch. Williams

   WISCONSIN -- KLUG. When Congress returns from its summer recess,

AUDI CABRIOLET IS A RITZY RAGTOP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you've got a rag-top car, summer is generally the best time
to go topless.
</P>
<P>
   Unless you're in Texas or Arizona, where the temperature reaches
triple digits rather routinely.
</P>
<P>
   So it was that I had a hard time enjoying the top-down benefits
of last week's test drive, the 1998 Audi Cabriolet.
</P>
<P>
   Don't blame the car. It really is designed for fun. And, even
though the back seat is a rather tight fit for full-size folks, at
least the Audi has a back seat _ unlike competitors such as the
Mercedes-Benz SLK roadster. Tight as it is, you really can cram a
couple of people in back in the Audi and enjoy a moonlight cruise.
</P>
<P>
   In the daytime in this heat, however, you'll want to keep the
top up and crank up the Audi's quite capable air-conditioner. The
nice thing about owning a ragtop in the Sun Belt, however, is that
you generally can ride with the top down in the spring, fall and
much of the winter without freezing to death.
</P>
<P>
   The Cabriolet's price starts at $34,500; it comes with a choice
of standard manual top or a really cool automatic roof that lowers
with the touch of a button. Our test car came with the automatic
one.
</P>
<P>
   To lower it, you merely engage the parking brake, turn on the
ignition and unlatch the roof with the twist of a single handle,
then press the button. All four side windows automatically lower, a
rear hatch pops open, and the soft top folds back into the trunk.
The hatch closes and locks in place, stowing the top neatly out of
view. If you continue to hold down the button, all four windows go
up.
</P>
<P>
   Our Audi came with a rear windscreen (a $400 option), raised by
another button, that cuts down on the wind in the cabin. Hair is
still going to fly, though, so why not wear a hat or scarf like
most veteran ragtop owners?
</P>
<P>
   Driving the Cabriolet is lots of fun, with or without the top
down.
</P>
<P>
   It's not the speediest car around; the 2.8-liter V-6 engine
cranks out just 172 horsepower and 184 foot-pounds of torque.
That's not enough to win many races, but it will let you keep up
with most of the competition in this class (such as the BMW 323i
convertible), and the book says you can go from zero to 60 mph in
10.3 seconds. Although the speedometer goes all the way to 160 mph,
the Cabriolet is electronically limited to 130 mph for U.S.
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Handling is remarkably nimble for a front-drive near-luxury car,
thanks partly to the somewhat stiff suspension. Passengers will not
enjoy the ride as much as the driver will enjoy the crisper
handling that results from the firm suspension, but, hey, this is
supposed to be a sporty car, not a cushy Caddy.
</P>
<P>
   Straight-drive purists won't like the fact that the Cabriolet
comes only with an automatic transmission, but the rest of us will
appreciate how smoothly the four-speed automatic shifts. It has
logic circuitry that alters the shift points to the driver's style,
which is a nice compromise if you can't have a stick shift.
</P>
<P>
   Luxury abounds in the Cabriolet, especially when you choose the
$3,700 premium-equipment package. The extra money pays for
all-leather seats, finely polished walnut trim on the doors and
dash, the power roof, and remote keyless entry.
</P>
<P>
   Our test car came with a few other options: the all-weather
package ($470), which added heated front seats, windshield-washer
nozzles and door locks; ``cool shades'' Pelican blue metallic paint
with platinum interior ($460); 16-inch ``competition-style'' wheels
with 205-55/16 tires ($400); and that previously mentioned interior
windscreen.
</P>
<P>
   With the $5,430 worth of factory options and the $500
transportation charge, total sticker was $40,530.
</P>
<P>
   Standard on all Cabriolets are leather-wrapped steering wheel,
leather-trimmed cloth seats, air-conditioning, front and rear fog
lights, cruise control, alarm system, dual power mirrors with
defogger, fan-assisted rear-window defroster, power windows and
door locks, Delco AM/FM/cassette stereo (wired for optional
six-disc CD changer), galvanized body panel, four-wheel disc brakes
with antilock system, rack-and-pinion power steering and headlight
washers.
</P>
<P>
   The front bucket seats are a lot more comfortable than the rear
bench. Sportier front buckets are optional ($1,190), but we didn't
have those on our vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Trunk space is just under 7 cubic feet with the top up, and much
less with the top down (it goes into the trunk, remember?). That
makes the Cabriolet rather inconvenient for long trips, especially
if you've got to put kids or the dog in the back seat. Otherwise,
your luggage would go there (not a really secure place for it in a
convertible, either).
</P>
<P>
   Fuel economy is a respectable 19 miles per gallon in the city
and 24 mpg on the highway. The fuel tank holds 17.4 gallons.

 &HT;    COLUMN: Pass-along plants a green reminder of happy kinships
 &HT;    By Lee May
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a good day for digging, soon enough after a rain, not
terribly hot or sticky. Flossie Dodge and I set off, down the stone
steps toward the stream running through her wooded landscape in
northwest Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Crossing the water, we came to what I had come for: several
clumps of Oconee bells, the evergreen herb with roundish, leathery
leaves that look like galax.
</P>
<P>
   On this day in late July, Flossie and her husband, David, were
preparing for their move to Madison. Her sharing was the kind of
thing you do when you're leaving a garden _ along with taking a few
cuttings, potting up a prized plant here and there and saying a lot
of goodbyes.
</P>
<P>
   As a frequent and longtime recipient of pass-along plants, I
always appreciate the connections with the givers. This gift was
especially meaningful.
</P>
<P>
   Oconee bells, first discovered in Oconee County, S.C., in 1788
and now considered rare and endangered, grow around the Blue Ridge
Mountains and in the highlands of Georgia and the Carolinas.
Flossie's plants came from her mother, Honto Hall, who rescued
Oconee bells from an abandoned home site 12 years ago and started
growing it in Highlands, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   In its natural habitat, Oconee bells is found along streams,
usually under shrubs. ``I don't think it'll survive in Madison,''
said Flossie, explaining that the woods around her new home ``are
not real old.''
</P>
<P>
   And, she and I agreed, it must survive.
</P>
<P>
   Alzheimer's disease now has Flossie's mother, so the once
knowledgeable and spirited gardener cannot keep this plant going.
For some years now, its survival has depended on Flossie. Now me.
Passing it on to keep it going ``is what she'd like,'' Flossie
said.
</P>
<P>
   And so we dig. The shallow-rooted plants, with runners forming
new clumps, come out easily, along with richly decayed leaves,
fragrant, like ancient woods. ``This is what it likes,'' Flossie
tells me.
</P>
<P>
   As we put the plants in plastic bags, we talk of mothers and
Alzheimer's. (It got Lyn's mother some six years ago, erasing her
memory of her wonderful gardening talents.)
</P>
<P>
   Of her 77-year-old mother, Flossie said: ``She was an artist _ a
watercolorist. She was an amateur floral designer. And she raised
four girls.'' I talked about how Lyn's mother, Hazel McConnell, 84,
once traveled the world, living in East Pakistan for several years.
How she followed her own advice to family and friends: ``Have all
the fun you can.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, since Alzheimer's got her, all that is moot. For her, but
not for those who knew her then, those who see her life being
sucked away, unable to do anything but watch. And wait.
</P>
<P>
   Such conversation contrasted starkly with the life-affirming act
of passing on these joyous little plants. But, of course, they were
linked.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, I had two bags of Oconee bells. I put some in a damp,
shady spot in my back garden, some under a rhododendron out front.
And I took some to McCaysville, planting one clump on the bank of
Fightingtown Creek and two on the edge of woods on the other side
of the cabin.
</P>
<P>
   I will have to wait until spring to see the small white flowers
rise on stalks and look like tilting bells.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in their new homes, the plants decide whether to
survive. I water and watch and wait, knowing they must.

 &HT;    It's a summer tradition on Lake Rabun _ Sunday worship for the
boat people, sky above, waves below.
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKEMONT, Ga. _ At 8:50 every Sunday morning between Memorial
Day and Labor Day the boats come into sight _ pontoon craft,
runabouts and ski boats _ skimming across the glimmering water like
bugs.
</P>
<P>
   They converge near a barge where a minister, a keyboardist and a
young choir robed with life jackets are ready to conduct a worship
service.
</P>
<P>
   Up a hill in a boathouse their landlubber counterparts sit on
backless benches overlooking the mica-like water where the deep
green images of the trees on the bank are doubled in their
reflection.
</P>
<P>
   The lapping waves of the boat wakes play a prelude.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good morning, Lake Rabun,'' says the Rev. Kirk Bozeman at 9
a.m. ``It's time for boat church!''
</P>
<P>
   Officially called Lake Rabun Leisure Ministries, boat church is
a 27-year tradition of Clayton's First United Methodist Church,
which holds its early service at the lake during the summer. On a
recent Sunday, 152 people came in about 45 boats; an additional 53
walked or drove to the boathouse.
</P>
<P>
   Theirs is a gathering diverse in both denomination and species,
since at least one boat usually includes a pet or two.
</P>
<P>
   On this Sunday in midsummer, Bozeman preaches from a passage of
Ecclesiastes brought into popular culture during the 1960s by the
Byrds: ``To everything there is a season and a time for every
purpose under heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   Bozeman speaks of life and death, chronology and eternity. But
here in this cathedral created by nature and the Georgia Power Co.,
which impounded the lake in 1915, the verses seem to apply
literally to budding springs of promise, steamy summers of fun and
relaxation, rich autumns of return to routine, and cold-winded
winters of contemplation.
</P>
<P>
   Boat church ``allows you to experience the beauty of this part
of God's creation as well as have a church service,'' said Cissy
Bruce Jackson, 33. At home in Birmingham she's an Episcopalian, but
here at her family's house on the lake, she's a boat-churcher.
``You don't have to get all dressed up and leave the lake to get
some religion.''
</P>
<P>
   The worship service makes a statement to people who are not
regular churchgoers, said Mary Jane Dennison, 25. She is attending
with her husband, Brian, 25, a University of Georgia law student
for whom boat church is a lifelong tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It says to people God isn't just there in a big building for
people in suits,'' she said.

 &HT;    Respite &AMP; Religion
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the lull of summer, as metro Atlanta churches cut back on
worship services, combine Sunday school classes and have a hiatus
in weeknight programs, houses of worship in popular getaway spots
are making room for pews full of visitors.
</P>
<P>
   While some of the city's top ministers are away from their
pulpits on vacation or sabbatical, in much different settings other
clergy are preaching to crowds _ many of them (both clergy and
congregation) in shorts and T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   Some retreats _ such as the Episcopal Church's Kanuga near
Hendersonville, N.C. _ are geared especially for people seeking
respite and religion. But even in decidedly secular settings from
the mountains to the seashore, congregations have developed special
ministries for vacationers.
</P>
<P>
   First Baptist Church in Helen, Ga., a little more than a decade
old, was founded to be ``a ministry to a tourist town, to the
tourists who come through Helen as well as the people who work in
the tourist industry,'' said the Rev. Kyle Woodfin, 35, its pastor.
``That has helped shape the personality of the church and the
outreach of the church.''
</P>
<P>
   With only 150 members, the church frequently has 180 to 190
people in worship. ``It's not uncommon for us to have 30 to 40
percent of the congregation on big weekends be tourists,'' he said.
``Our church realizes that's a part of who we are and welcomes
that.''
</P>
<P>
   The church operates Georgia Mountain Resort Ministries, which
uses about 400 volunteers a year, including many church youth
groups, to work in the area. The ministry operates as many as six
simultaneous day camps for children in different locations where
tourists stay and play, and an Alzheimer's club for family members
to leave patients for a few hours in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Several days a week, groups of college students walk along the
Chattahoochee River and the Appalachian Trail to clean up after
tubers and campers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do this as a community service,'' Woodfin said, ``but it
also gives us an opportunity to interact with campers and hikers.
We share Gatorade, Snickers bars, whatever we happen to have.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of the church are mostly retired people or people who
have moved into the area to work, Woodfin said. For those who work
in Helen's shops and hotels, Sunday is one of the busiest days of
the week, so the church has an early morning service geared to
them, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Focusing a church on the tourist industry ``does take a
different mind-set,'' said Woodfin, who came to Helen from
Clarkesville five years ago. ``We realize a lot of people on
vacation don't bring coats and ties and dresses.''
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Arnold Belzer, 54, of Congregation Mickve Israel in
Savannah, Ga., said he likes the fact that visitors often show up
in shorts. It helps him recognize them as guests, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Belzer's Reform synagogue is not only in a tourist town, it is a
tourist attraction in its own right. Its congregation was founded
in 1733, only five months after James Edward Oglethorpe brought a
load of colonists to Georgia, and its Gothic building is a regular
stop on tours of the city.
</P>
<P>
   The number of visitors has doubled in the past five years, the
rabbi said, since the book and film ``Midnight in the Garden of
Good and Evil'' and the PBS television show ``This Old House''
featured Savannah prominently.
</P>
<P>
   During the week, docents at the synagogue give tours to visitors
and answer questions. A museum features the country's oldest Torah,
brought over by the 42 Jews who accompanied Oglethorpe and already
old at the time, and a collection of letters from 14 U.S.
presidents, including Washington, Jefferson and Madison. A gift
shop offers Judaica and souvenirs, including a mezuzah in the shape
of the synagogue.
</P>
<P>
   During services on Friday evenings and Saturdays, the rabbi asks
all members to greet strangers with a ``Shalom, y'all.'' After
Saturday worship services, the congregation invites all guests to
share lunch _ even those who have not attended services but have
come only to see the building.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is such a thing as a free lunch,'' the rabbi quips.
</P>
<P>
   At times, especially in spring, visitors, many of them non-Jews,
outnumber the members at the 350-family synagogue, Belzer said. ``I
don't want visitors to know that,'' he said, ``but it's a wonderful
problem to have.''
</P>
<P>
   The hottest months are a slow time on St. Simons Island, said
the Rev. Germain Belen, a Franciscan priest who serves St. William
Catholic Church. ``Most of our people leave during the summer,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But in winter, the 10:30 a.m. Sunday Mass at the 650-seat church
is standing room only.
</P>
<P>
   Some visitors who come to the island every winter have been part
of the church for years, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Looking out over the congregation, Belen said he can always tell
who is going to the golf course afterward because of the way they
dress.
</P>
<P>
   The most enjoyable aspect of a tourist-heavy church is ``meeting
new people,''he said.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the special needs of a tourist-heavy ministry, the
country's largest Protestant denomination has set up a special
department to establish ministries and advise churches. The Rev.
Jeff Wagner heads resort ministries for the Southern Baptist
Convention's Atlanta-based North American Mission Board.
</P>
<P>
   Wagner, 38, first became involved in resort ministry as a
student at Golden Gate Baptist Theological Seminary outside San
Francisco. He was asked to start a new ministry in the Russian
River area of Northern California. He began with puppets and games
for children in campgrounds along the beach areas of the river and
built on those efforts. From the new Redwood Resort Ministry, he
moved to Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I learned was that resort areas are often neglected by
traditional churches,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A challenge of such ministries is dealing with the workers in
the tourism industry, Wagner said. ``People go there thinking
they're going to have the same experience they had on vacation.
They realize it's hard work, long hours, low pay and high rent. The
payoff is the beauty of the area, and the slow times when they can
recuperate. Those who live and work in those settings tend to
balance that.''
</P>
<P>
   Worship in resort areas should draw from its setting, said
Wagner, such as an oceanside reference to Jesus calming the waters
for his disciples. ``You use those kinds of illustrations so that
when people go home, part of their memory is not only did they
recreate, but they re-created themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   To be an effective minister to tourists, Wagner said, a minister
``has to learn how to be a tourist. You have to remember why people
come there in the first place.''

 &HT;    Give a designer a blank canvas, a good cause, and creativity
sizzles
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When a designer invites you to dinner, you can usually count on
the table being a dazzler _ elegant china, sparkling stemware,
exotic flowers.
</P>
<P>
   And when 50 of them agree to host the same party, you can bet
the heat will be on to push those tables over the top. A little
friendly competition suddenly makes a place setting good enough for
Martha Stewart about as flashy as a fast-food takeout tray.
</P>
<P>
   Such will be the case Aug. 27, when the Atlanta chapter of
DIFFA, Design Industries Foundation Fighting AIDS, hosts
``Collection Rouge II: Dining by Design.'' The fund-raising dinner
combines nine three-dimensional tabletop creations by nationally
renowned designers and 41 done by local talents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some tables are outrageous, others are hilarious and some,
just sleek and sophisticated,'' said David Sheppard, national
director of the 15-chapter, New York-based DIFFA.
</P>
<P>
   The outrageous: Fashion designer Anne Klein shows what ``Dining
With the Devil With the Red Dress On'' can be like. Radiant
8-foot-tall, flame-shaped chairs, made from plastic glass, sizzle
around a table with an 11-foot mannequin, ``Miss Mephistopheles,''
rising out of it.
</P>
<P>
   The hilarious: Atlanta interior designer Carole Weaks gives new
meaning to a live centerpiece by putting a masculine Carmen Miranda
in the middle of the table, entertaining guests by passing out
fruit.
</P>
<P>
   The sleek and sophisticated: Home and fashion guru Calvin Klein
stretches a 9-foot-long centerpiece to the max with 36 fat candles
_ nothing else _ for an intimate, minimalist look.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta designers _ who come from the interiors, fashion,
floral and hair industries _ are pulling out all the stops, from
tented tables to gushing waterfalls, said Kevin Knaus, a local
DIFFA board member. ``They're really going much more over the top
than they did in New York,'' where the tour began, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's because many participants already have seen the
traveling designs, which have appeared in Elle Decor magazine, the
event's national media sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   Each Atlanta-area designer is given a plain 72-inch round table
with three stipulations: The design must accommodate 10 guests,
reflect the red theme and include stemware for serving champagne.
</P>
<P>
   The bubbly's important, because the event is sponsored by
Champagne Mumm. The company first joined forces with DIFFA in 1995
to stage a traveling, red-themed fashion extravaganza that also
teamed up with local talent in major cities, including Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt like Atlanta remembered it from the first time and
that this would be a really great way to build on that by
participating,'' said John Dyer, chairman of DIFFA's Atlanta
chapter.
</P>
<P>
   The dining tour, with stops in eight cities, supports local AIDS
care organizations through company sponsorships of tables, priced
from $2,500 to $25,000. So far, Dining by Design has raised more
than $550,000 in three cities, and Atlanta's event is nearly sold
out. ``It's gone gangbusters,'' event chairwoman Sara Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers believe the big selling point is that, unlike formal
seated dinners, Dining by Design is an interactive event, where
guests are encouraged to move from table to table and check out the
designs.
</P>
<P>
   And innovation is everything these days when competing for
charity dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public has this false impression the fight against AIDS is
over, which makes it tough for organizations,'' said Sheppard, a
former Atlanta interior designer. ``DIFFA is different, in that we
have this loyal support from the design communities in our chapter
cities. And people know that when these designers get involved,
they're going to experience something really special.''

 &HT;    Traveler's work focuses on divine experiences
 &HT;    FREELANCE STORY. TO BE USED BY COX PAPERS ONLY. NOT TO BE USED
BY NY TIMES WIRE.
 &HT;    By Laurie Scott
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Someone who travels around America asking people if they've seen
God lately could very well attract the attention of local law
enforcement. But when writer/photographer Steve Wall took just such
a trip, he stumbled upon several people who not only didn't think
he was nuts, but who shared fascinating stories about their
experience of the divine. ``Dancing With God'' (St. Martin's Press,
240 pages) is the record of Wall's adventure.
</P>
<P>
   Wall, who has had a long career as a photojournalist for
``National Geographic'', ``Time'' and other magazines, says his
grandmother is responsible for his strong desire to explore
spirituality.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really started with my grandmother telling me stories when
I was four or five years old,'' Wall recalls ``She's always pointed
me toward the divine.'' Wall remembers being haunted by his
grandmother's account of the night she believed an angel visited
her.
</P>
<P>
   Wall's work with Native American spiritual elders, which led to
his best-selling books ``Wisdomkeepers'' and ``Wisdom's
Daughters,'' fueled the fire of his interest. When his son
suggested that he seek out spiritual elders who weren't Native
American, Wall was ready to continue his life's quest. ``So I
started this journey of just getting in my truck and following my
own intuition,'' he said. He admits to being changed by what he
found.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Wall met Little Willis who survives on the streets
of Atlanta while devoting all his time to activities like finding
coats for friends. These friends seem convinced Little Willis is
doing God's work.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd Justice of Toccoa, who was pulled from a river still alive
after some two hours underwater, told Wall he felt God's presence
with him and knew he wouldn't die. Gwen Scott, former anchor at CNN
Headline New, now living in Albuquerque, described having a vision
of the Virgin Mary which kept her from committing suicide. Germaine
Curley of Picayune, Miss., spoke about often hearing a voice which
diverts her from danger.
</P>
<P>
   Wall notes that people in crisis may be more open to the
spiritual plane. ``I am convinced that the divine is real in all of
our lives whether we recognize it or not. A lot of times when
you're sitting on top of the mountain in your bliss you don't pay
attention. When you get into a crisis situation you are much more
open to other possibilities. He also noticed real kindness in each
person he met. '''Each and every one of them did have this love,''
he said, ``and there was a gentleness about each one.''
</P>
<P>
   Wall is quick to admit how much he learned from these people and
how he was changed by them. ``There are some things that happened
to me that I recognize have changed me at this point, he said.
``But I don't know what effect the others had on me for tomorrow or
next week, because I may not realize what that person's lesson was
for me until down the road sometime.'' William McFarland, a Vietnam
vet who suffers from severe flashbacks and horrific memories, had a
profound effect. While driving through Texas together, Wall and
McFarland saw a woman riding on a donkey whom McFarland identified
as the Virgin Mary. ``There was a love about him and a caring, Wall
says. ``I offered to share my hotel room. He wouldn't do it because
he was afraid he'd have a dream and hurt me.''
</P>
<P>
   Wall says he was also very moved by the artist Fernando Mercado.
``Some of these people have had events in their lives that are so
dramatic. And his was more of coming to an understanding of things
for himself. And yet, he said he saw God everyday.'' Mercado told
Wall that the crucial things are ``love, respect and pay(ing)
attention!''
</P>
<P>
   Not all of Wall's experiences were encouraging. While dressed as
a street person he attended services at a large Atlanta church. ``I
wanted to find out how people reacted to those who were down and
out,'' he said. ``I've always thought of the church as possibly the
one place where you could really find comfort, you could actually
find help there because that's actually what they talk about.''
</P>
<P>
   The reception he received was far from warm. First, several men
in the church asked Wall to move to a pew of homeless men in the
front where the other visitors were sitting. Then the minister
directed his sermon about rising from the gutter at Wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw some of the people in a very different light,'' Wall
remembers. ``There were expressions of condemnation . . . It was
like I was an island . . . an island of garbage. and they wanted to
keep away from me. ``
</P>
<P>
   But most of Wall's experiences brought him hope, and he returned
feeling that the divine is present in day to day life. ``If we just
look out our windows and we see the creation, then we know that the
creation is a part of us,'' he said. ``We're a part of it . . . If
that's so, then the Creator is in you. and you can't separate
yourself from the Creator.''

 &HT;    Presbyterians build house in Mexico
 &HT;    By Derrick Henry
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the seventh consecutive year, St. Luke's Presbyterian Church
of Dunwoody, Georgia sent a group to Mexico to build a house in
Piedras Negras, a border town across from Eagle Pass, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The 36 church members, ages 12 to 60, spent a week last month
hand-constructing a simple three-room house in temperatures that
reached 110 to 120 degrees each day. Everything was done by hand,
even mixing the concrete. ``These people live in a massive expanse
of tar-paper shacks under conditions we won't put animals in,''
says Dunwoody lawyer C. G. ``Sonny'' Jester, who headed the St.
Luke's Mexican mission. ``For them, these new houses are palaces.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Luke's has scheduled next year's Mexican housebuilding trip
for July 3-10. The project is a partnership with the Birmingham
organization ``Constructores para Christo'' (Builders for
Christ).www.jobseekers.org
</P>
<P>
   Mitchem named to post
</P>
<P>
   Nichelle A. Mitchem has been appointed executive director of
metro Atlanta's Partnership Against Domestic Violence, effective
Aug. 3. A native of Colorado Springs, Colo., Mitchem, 36, has more
than 10 years experience with organizations combating domestic
violence, most recently as executive director for the New Jersey
Women &AMP; AIDS Network. Her advocacy of battered women began in law
school at the University of Wisconsin, where she interned in a
legal assistance program for female prisoners. Mitchem replaces
Barbara Sachs.

<P>
   JobSeekers expands
</P>
<P>
   Since 1991, JobSeekers has helped hundreds of unemployed Atlanta
white collar men through its extensive job networking services and
emotional and spiritual support. Now the Atlanta-based nonprofit
Christian organization is rapidly expanding its mission. It has
just opened a branch in Peachtree City, with additional branches to
follow over the next two months in Phoenix, Ariz.; Chattanooga,
Tenn.; Modesto, Calif.; and Fort Lauderdale, Fla. Last year,
JobSeekers opened its first out-of-state branches, in Knoxville,
Tenn., and Tucson, Ariz. To learn more about the organization, call

SAN FRANCISCO MAY BAN JET SKIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RACHEL GORDON  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ San Francisco officials are considering banning
the use of Jet Skis and other personal watercraft from within 1,200
feet of shoreline, a move that supporters hope will trigger a wave
of other jurisdictions to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is so important for the quality of life _ for the noise,
for safety, for the environment,'' said Supervisor Gavin Newsom,
chief sponsor of the legislation. ``In many respects, we are
setting a tone and creating a model for other counties.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposed law, the first of its kind by a county in the San
Francisco Bay area, would forbid personal watercraft along much of
the waterfront, including Alcatraz, Treasure and Yerba Buena
islands and the east side of Angel Island.
</P>
<P>
   Personal watercraft are manufactured under such names as Jet
Skis, Sea Doos and Waverunners.
</P>
<P>
   The only launch site allowed in the city would be Pier 52 in
China Basin. The personal watercraft also could come to shore at
Gas House Cove near Aquatic Park for fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Violators would be subject to a $50 fine for the first
infraction, $100 for the second and $250 for the third violation
and subsequent ones in a year's period. In addition, the law would
allow San Francisco residents to sue the personal watercraft
operators.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal won the unanimous support of the Board of
Supervisors' Health, Family and Environment Committee. The full
board is expected to approve it. The earliest the personal
watercraft would be outlawed near San Francisco shores would be
mid-October.
</P>
<P>
   Wendy Mahan, who sells personal watercraft in Daly City, said
the proposed law was insane. ``I can understand restricting some
areas,'' she said, ``but something like this is too restrictive.
It's unfair.''
</P>
<P>
   Trade associations also oppose the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our members are very concerned any time a political
jurisdiction attempts to take away people's abilities to use public
waterways,'' said Mark Denny, public affairs director of the Santa
Ana-based International Jet Sports Boating Association. He said
other boats, ``even tankers carrying nuclear waste,'' seem to have
fewer restrictions than personal watercraft.
</P>
<P>
   Among those supporting the proposed ban are kayakers, swimmers,
surfers, fishermen and environmentalists.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ At 5 a.m. Friday, Rhonda Roenfeldt, 23, woke up in
Queens, put on a glittery tube top in metallic blue and a tube
skirt patterned with Indian goddesses and fitted a long black wig
over her red hair. She said she applied more makeup than usual,
using several coats of jet-black mascara, then gathered her head
shot and some sheet music and made her way to Manhattan to the open
casting call for ``And the Beat Goes On: The Sonny and Cher
Story,'' a made-for-television movie that will air on ABC in
February.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many of the bewigged Cher hopefuls, who stood in line
outside the Anne G. Wilder Theater on West 42nd Street, Ms.
Roenfeldt, who tends bar on Second Avenue in Manhattan, seemed
terrifyingly confident, projecting the defensive happiness and
high-beam smile of a fledgling actress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someday, I will be a very highly paid movie actress,'' she
said, her bold words somehow not meshing with a shy smile. In the
four-hour wait from her arrival in line to her audition, she had
befriended Maggie Gallagher, 29, a teacher from Manhattan, and
Sharon Allitt, a paralegal from Beachwood, N.J., and they both
nodded soberly in agreement. In homage to the Cher of the 1970s,
all three women wore midriff-baring tops, but in a distinct nod to
the '90s, all three exposed belly buttons were pierced.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Roenfeldt, the mother of a 2-year-old daughter, didn't
remember ever seeing Sonny and Cher when they were on television.
Ms. Gallagher wanted to sing ``If I Could Turn Back Time,'' and Ms.
Allitt was going for the big kahuna, ``Gypsies, Tramps and
Thieves.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the legions of rumpled nonprofessionals, the long hours
and the guaranteed tears of heartbroken amateurs, the open casting
call has worked for Larry Thompson, the project's producer.
Thompson _ who was a lawyer for both Sonny and Cher until their
divorce, after which he represented Sonny only _ also produced
``Lucy and Desi: Before the Laughter'' for CBS in 1991, and found
his actor and actress in a similar open call. Several hundred
people turned out for his recent auditions in Chicago, Los Angeles
and New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're making a movie about icons, people who are the
audience know what those icons look like,'' Thompson said. ``So if
you cast a star or a celebrity in the role of Sonny or Cher, it's
difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And the Beat Goes On'' is based on Sonny Bono's autobiography,
which was a fleeting best seller in 1991, and will depict the
couple's life together, from the moment they first met _ when
Salvatore Bono was a driver for a meat-packing company _ to the
period after their divorce.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would drive his truck down Hollywood Boulevard, stop at the
speciality record companies, rip off his bloody apron and start
pitching his songs with blood still on his shoes,'' said Maura
Dunbar, an ABC vice president, who oversees miniseries and special
projects.
</P>
<P>
   When Sonny was 28, he met 16-year-old Cherilyn Sarkisian
LaPierre, an aspiring singer so shy she was unable to sing by
herself. Together, they hit the charts, dropped off the charts and
had a baby. She bared her belly button, he wore fur vests and they
became symbols of the smiley-face '70s. They spawned four variety
shows: ``The Sonny and Cher Show'' was the first. After their
divorce, there was ``The Sonny Show,'' ``The Cher Show'' and then
``The Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour'' _ which Thompson calls ``The
Sonny and Cher Divorce Show.''
</P>
<P>
   Bono metamorphosed from campy crooner to restaurateur to Palm
Springs, Calif., Mayor to U.S. congressman, and died last January
in a skiing accident. His wife, Representative Mary Bono, is
cooperating with the film. Cher, who transformed herself from
pre-disco chanteuse to Oscar-winning actress to hawker of hair
products, is not.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not Thompson finds his Cher or Sonny among the
hundreds of people who auditioned for him, he succeeded in
generating a shudder of publicity for his made-for-television
movie. More than a half-dozen camera crews stuck their microphones
into the pancaked faces of the Cher wannabes. Stories went out
about the woman who drove nine hours from Missouri to get to the
Chicago auditions, and the middle-aged couple who perform a Sonny
and Cher act in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Entertainment Tonight,'' the nightly television magazine show,
followed actress Elizabeth York for two days before her Manhattan
audition, recording her every step.
</P>
<P>
   But the aspiring Sonnys and Chers displayed a consistent lack of
cynicism about the publicity stunt. ``Look, even if this thing is
already pre-cast, we don't care,'' Selena Cantor, a professional
singer, said. ``This is the way Broadway works. You get some
buzz.'' For her audition, she sang ``I Got You, Babe'' with Stephen
Morfesis, a reiki masseur she had met on line. (``It was a
four-hour romance,'' he said.) Despite Morfesis' toothy Bono-esque
smile and Ms. Cantor's resemblance to Cher, Thompson said the
dreaded words _ ``thank you'' _ before they finished.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. York, the actress tailed by the ET crew, said she felt
awkward about all the cameras _ but hey, that's show biz. ``I feel
like I'm being used, that it's just a manufactured event, sure, but
it's kind of what most actors do all the time anyway,'' she said.
``This role could have been cast months ago, and I'd still be here
today. I'm getting out there, do you know what I mean? And at least
I got a great outfit out of it,'' she added, pulling at her
lizard-print nylon pants suit, circa 1975.
</P>
<P>
   The auditions rolled. Thompson sat inside the darkened theater
listening to a relentless stream of women sing the first few lines
of ``I Got You, Babe.'' After vamping confidently in line for
hours, many of the women became inexplicably shy when they hit the
stage, their voices whittled down to a whisper. Suddenly, they were
standing in a dark room looking at bright lights and steely eyed
producers, no longer discussing itchy wigs outside in the safe
sunshine.
</P>
<P>
   Auditioner No. 19, Dina Nicki Rassias, stood on stage in her
striped tank dress, her arms goose-pimpled from the
air-conditioning, and spoke about why she wanted the part.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was growing up, I would watch Cher, and here I was this
little Greek-Romanian girl and she was this little Armenian girl,
and I thought, I can be beautiful, too, without being one of these
huge blond all-American beauties,'' she said, and started to sing.
Thompson said, ``Thank you.''
</P>
<P>
   At her audition, Ms. Gallagher, the teacher, belted out ``If I
Could Turn Back Time'' with exaggerated gutsiness, moving her lips
in distinctive Cher style. Thompson cut her off with a swift but
warm ``thank you.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside in the hallway, reunited with her temporary friends
again, Ms. Gallagher looked upset. Her lower lip trembled. She said
she wanted to get a drink. ``If only I hadn't cracked on that
note,'' she said, her face drawn. ``Maybe I would have had a
chance.''

THE DYSFUNCTIONAL FAMILY CHANNEL   
 (EMBARGOED FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 16) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVE WALKER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Let's play word-association. I write a word, and you
list all of the related words that quickly come to mind.
</P>
<P>
   First word: Family.
</P>
<P>
   Second word: Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Third word: Attitude.
</P>
<P>
   In all but the most dysfunctional lives, ``family'' should
conjure such concepts as ``love'' and ``respect'' and ``comfort''
and ``wholesome'' and ``caring'' and maybe ``bathroom-sharing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Fox,'' as in Rupert Murdoch's Fox entertainment empire, should
spark associations with words like ``Married'' and ``with'' and
``Children.'' Or ``When'' and ``Animals'' and ``Attack'' and
``IV.''
</P>
<P>
   You could swap ``attitude'' _ as in ``That dude's got an
attitude, man!'' _ with ``rude'' or ``obnoxious'' or ``unkind,'' or
maybe ``penitentiary-bound doom magnet.'' Use it in a sentence and
you're also likely to use a phrase like ``loud-mouth mall punk.''
Picture ``attitude'' and you see a head-wagging Springerette just
before she lunges for a handful of someone else's hair.
</P>
<P>
   All three words _ Fox, family and attitude _ are associated by
way of the makeover that's been done by Murdoch on what used to be
The Family Channel.
</P>
<P>
   The new Fox Family Channel has ditched all but one element of
the old Family Channel's programming _ which relied heavily on
comfortable, wholesome reruns like ``Bonanza,'' ``Diagnosis
Murder'' and ``The'' ``Big Valley'' _ in favor of a new lineup with
``attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   About half of all the new shows are original. In prime time on
weeknights, there will be original video-clip shows (a Fox
favorite), game shows and a sketch comedy built around the ancient
Mr. Bill character from ``Saturday Night Live.''
</P>
<P>
   There will also be movies, including original movies starring
the likes of Tom Arnold (and an unauthorized Michael Jordan biopic
is also in the works). Preschoolers are the targets in the morning
and midday, older kids and younger teens appear to be the targets
in the afternoons. Families, all watching together, are targeted at
night.
</P>
<P>
   Families with attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most TV is not safe for family viewing, and that is why
families need the Fox Family Channel,'' said Rich Cronin, president
and CEO of the new net, who met recently with TV critics in
Pasadena, Calif. ``The current Family Channel has a strong
following, but kids and teens are not sitting down with their
parents to watch shows like ``Diagnosis Murder'' or ``Hawaii
Five-0.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These are fine shows, don't get me wrong, but we have the
opportunity with Fox Family Channel to expand on the current
audience by creating a network that the whole family will watch
together, a network that entertains contemporary families with a
Fox attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, you may be wondering: How do you define contemporary
families, and what exactly is Fox attitude?
</P>
<P>
   ``We would love to have every single family in America watching
Fox Family Channel, but we've got to focus. Our focus is on
families that are a little younger, more suburban or urban, more
plugged in to pop culture. What we call contemporary families who
appreciate a network with attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``And how do we define Fox attitude? We think it's a funny,
quirky, surprising, savvy attitude that is combined with our
mandate to always be safe for family viewing.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Super spin &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Fox'' and ``safe'' and ``family'' _ does anybody else notice
that burning smell, or hear the faint howling of souls suffering
eternal damnation?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Fox may be chasing a ghost. The multiple-TV household
and expertly programmed niche networks have seemingly splintered
the nuclear viewing family. The soon-to-launch Pax Net is aiming
for the same apparition.
</P>
<P>
   That the big networks have abandoned families probably shouldn't
be interpreted as an evil plot. It's a business trend. Families
haven't stopped watching TV together because there's nothing
wholesome to watch (though family advocates would disagree), but
rather because the kids have viewing choices they like better
playing on the little set in the back room.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt, those choices _ Fox Family Channel competitors such as
Nickelodeon, the Disney Channel and the Cartoon Network _ all have
a bit of sassy ``attitude.'' Adults are not universally respected
in some of the programming on those networks, and musical promos
and soundtracks often share gangsta rap's rhythmic vocabulary.
</P>
<P>
   The big difference here is Fox, which has proven over time _
despite ``Ally McBeal,'' despite ``The Simpsons,'' despite ``The
X-Files'' _ that it can't be trusted.
</P>
<P>
   Given its otherwise craven business plan (see any sweeps ratings
month, clogged with lower-order-appeal reality programs), Fox's
aesthetic successes (see above list) have to be judged as
accidents.
</P>
<P>
   Fox and family. Fox and family. It's just such a stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing on the Fox network's prime-time schedule that
I would feel comfortable sitting down and watching with my
family,'' said Mark Honig, executive director of the Parents
Television Council, an advocacy group whose World Wide Web site
(www.parentstv.org) carries family-friendly TV recommendations
while hounding the networks for ruining America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even in the mildest of their shows _ ``The Simpsons'' and
``King of the'' ``Hill'' _ there are aspects of those programs
you'd just get ambushed by.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the Fox Family Channel's premiere programs, airing
Sunday, is a Spice Girls concert. Next Sunday, the feature film is
``Home Alone'' ``II'' (edited down, as will all of the Fox Family
Channel's library of feature films, to the equivalent of a ``G''
movie rating.) Even one of the new network's brightest programming
decisions _ to rerun the fabulous ``Pee-wee's Playhouse'' series,
which has been mothballed since its creator, Paul Reubens, was
busted in 1991 for indecent exposure in a Florida porno theater _
will strike some potential viewers as inappropriate. &QL; 
 &QL; 
`700 Club' stays  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lord knows what Pee-wee's lineup mate, Family Channel founder
Pat Robertson, thinks about it.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the $1.9 billion transaction between Murdoch and
Robertson, the televangelist and political power broker gets to
keep his fire 'n' brimstone ministry on the network. After a brief
launch period without it, Fox Family will air 90 minutes of ``The
700 Club'' every weekday morning.
</P>
<P>
   So, if you're checking your TV listings, holy mayhem raining
down on gay-loving Orlando comes right after ``Mork &AMP; Mindy'' and
just before ``The All New Captain Kangaroo.''
</P>
<P>
   More ``700 Club'' follows the evening movie.
</P>
<P>
   Audience flow _ it's a key consideration for most TV programmers
_ will be one of the first challenges for the Fox Family Channel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're happy to have Pat Robertson and his ``700 Club'' on the
air,'' said Haim Saban, of Saban Entertainment (distributor of the
``Mighty'' ``Morphin Power Ranger''s) and Murdoch's partner in the
Fox Family Channel. ``We don't think it's conflicting with anything
that we're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time ``The 700 Club'' airs, ``all the kids that are above
preschool are gone to school,'' said Saban, who also met with the
critics. ``Families watch the ``700 Club.'' Mothers watch ``The 700
Club.''''
</P>
<P>
   Programs that follow ``The 700 Club'' ``will be appointment
television for preschoolers,'' he said. ``Preschoolers and their
moms will know that is when preschool programming on the Fox Family
Channel starts. There will be a flow.'' &QL;

GITTA SERENY: CLOSE ENOUGH TO EVIL TO LOOK BEYOND IT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SARAH LYALL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ In three decades of studying guilt, responsibility and
the nature of evil through the twin obsessions of her professional
life, Nazis and child criminals, Gitta Sereny has regularly been
accused of growing too close to her subjects, of becoming not only
a confessor but an apologist.
</P>
<P>
   When she wrote ``Into That Darkness'' (Random House, 1983) a
rigorous examination of the unspeakable crimes of Franz Stangl, the
fearsome commandant of the Treblinka death camp and one of Nazism's
cruelest practitioners, a critic demanded to know how she could
have, as she described in the book, made soup for the ailing Stangl
on the last day she spent with him.
</P>
<P>
   (``I had to ask myself whether there was something morally wrong
with what I had done,'' Ms. Sereny says now. ``But it was a
pragmatic thing: I needed him for another day.'')
</P>
<P>
   And when she published ``Albert Speer: His Battle With Truth''
(Knopf, 1995), the result of a 16-year project that delved deep
into the conscience of Speer, Hitler's brilliant, urbane architect
and one of his closest confidants, Ms. Sereny daringly revealed in
her very first sentence that she ``grew to like'' her subject.
</P>
<P>
   But the great accomplishment of the book served to quell all but
the most carping criticism: Ms. Sereny, through her relentless
questioning and amassing of evidence, finally forced Speer to admit
what he had been concealing even from himself: that he had known
and tacitly consented to Hitler's ``final solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing in her journalistic career, however, prepared the
formidable Ms. Sereny, now 76, for the uproar that greeted her in
Britain last spring, when she published her most recent book,
``Cries Unheard.'' The book is about Mary Bell, who became one of
Britain's most notorious criminals in 1968 when, barely 11, she
murdered two little boys and then appeared, at least to a horrified
nation that followed the news of her case, to have no remorse.
</P>
<P>
   With her customary habit of becoming immersed in her subject,
Ms. Sereny spoke to Mary Bell over a period of months, sometimes
for as long as 10 hours a day, in an effort to understand what
drove her to commit her crimes. But this time, Ms. Sereny's
involvement in her subject went even further, and she grew to like
Ms. Bell and to believe that she had truly redeemed herself.
</P>
<P>
   Reaction here was swift and condemnatory, particularly when it
emerged that Ms. Sereny paid Ms. Bell for her cooperation. The
public reacted with a surge of fury and moral outrage to Ms.
Sereny's conclusion that Ms. Bell had not been morally responsible
for her crimes because of her age and because she herself had
suffered abuse as a young girl. The British tabloids referred to
Ms. Bell's ``blood money'' and ``depraved story.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Gitta Sereny is confused when it comes to issues of
moral blame,'' Andrew O'Hagen, the author of ``The Missing,'' an
account of violence and murder in Britain, told The Guardian in
April, criticizing the way she ``found it easy to enter into
complicity with Mary Bell in her more self-redeeming aspects.''
</P>
<P>
   As Ms. Sereny's other work, ``Cries Unheard'' wrestles with the
idea of guilt, evil and the possibility of redemption in a
civilized society. It also speaks to the fraught, sometimes
mutually exploitative relationship between subject and biographer,
a relationship whose implications Ms. Sereny said she fully
understood from the start.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in her cool, book-filled London apartment recently, Ms.
Sereny was still resolute in her conviction that she was right to
write the book, and right to research it the way she had.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they don't understand is that if you do what I do, you
have to develop a relationship,'' said Ms. Sereny, a small woman
with close-cropped graying hair, large eyes and an intense manner.
``There is no other way. Your relationship is always at a distance,
of course. But it's not possible to spend weeks or months with
someone and not develop a relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Cries Unheard'' which is to be published in the United States
next spring by Metropolitan Books, an imprint of Henry Holt,
examines the murders in excruciating detail and is not, Ms. Sereny
stressed, intended to justify what Mary Bell did. But the book
dwells at length on Ms. Bell's time in prison, at the mercy of a
system that Ms. Sereny says is woefully inadequate for child
criminals.
</P>
<P>
   It also provides a wrenching chronicle of her childhood: she was
abandoned by her father and unloved by her mother, a prostitute who
tried to murder Mary on a number of occasions and who forced her to
perform sex acts with her customers.

 LONDON: her customers.   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Through her work with Ms. Bell, who is now living somewhere in
the north of England under a new name with her 14-year-old
daughter, Ms. Sereny became more convinced that there was no such
thing as an evil child. That notion, she says, puts her in conflict
with what seems to be the conventional wisdom in Britain, where
Mary Bell and the two young boys who killed 3-year-old Jamie Bulger
in another notorious case in Britain several years ago are seen as
the embodiment of wickedness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Behind their reaction is the idea of the Devil, the idea of
evil,'' she said of her critics. ``There is this belief that the
evil person is evil, period. There's no rehabilitation, no
redemption. This is a Christian nation, but the Christianity stops
short of redemption.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sereny's examination of these issues is particularly
pertinent now, as the United States grapples with a rash of
horrific murders by children. In the most recent case, two boys,
ages 7 and 8, have been accused of sexually assaulting and killing
an 11-year-old girl in Chicago, raising calls for them to be tried
as adults.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sereny emphatically disagrees. ``I think 14 is a fair age to
make a child morally responsible, because there's been a moral
growth,'' she said. ``Children at 10, 9 and 8 are not morally
grown. Why should they be, any more than intellectually or
physically?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bell's daughter, a straight-A student who seems untouched by
the chain of hatred and violence that so affected Ms. Bell, is
living proof that redemption is possible, she said. ``Mary Bell has
broken the cycle by her own character, her own strength,'' Ms.
Sereny said. ``Instead of being demonized, she should be celebrated
for what she has accomplished.''
</P>
<P>
   Even after a career spent facing down the perpetrators of evil,
Ms. Sereny does not believe that people are evil, except perhaps in
exceptional cases like those of Hitler or Fred and Rosemary West,
the notorious British child killers who tortured and sexually
assaulted their victims. But those sorts of people are rare indeed,
she said, and they hold no interest for her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a great believer in people's capacity to change, to find
themselves, to understand if they have done something terribly
bad,'' Ms. Sereny said. That, she explained, is partly why she had
sympathy for Speer, who was consumed by guilt and who tried so hard
to redeem himself by relentlessly examining his own soul. ``I grew
to like him when I realized he really wanted to find out the truth
for himself,'' she said. ``That is very likable, when the truth is
so terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sereny's own search for the truth has lasted nearly all her
life. She was born in Vienna, read ``Mein Kampf'' as a teen-ager
and, though not Jewish, began to recognize the horrors of Nazism as
she saw Jews beginning to disappear from her neighborhood. She was
in Paris, studying at the Sorbonne, when France fell to the Nazis,
and she left school and began working as a nurse at a camp for
abandoned children. When her anti-Nazi work made it impossible for
her to remain, she left Europe, returning after the war as a United
Nations child welfare officer, working with children who had been
in concentration camps.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are made by the circumstances of their lives, and what
I am involved in comes out of the war,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sereny began to work as a journalist, and gained a
reputation as a dogged investigator who would not stop until she
wrestled her subject into submission. Some 20 years later, living
in London with her husband, Don Honeyman, a photographer, she was
sent by The Daily Telegraph magazine to cover the war-crimes trials
of former Nazis in Duesseldorf, Hamburg and several other German
cities. On and off for six months, Ms. Sereny sat and listened as
witness after witness described the indescribable. And as the
stories began to come alive, the truth became in a way more
elusive.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of them _ the accused and the witnesses _ had two things
in common,'' she said. ``None of them wanted to be there, and they
had all seen or done things no human being should ever see or do.
The blocking of these experiences and these feelings, and the guilt
at what they had felt or seen or done, was so strong.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What you didn't get was themselves,'' she added. ``You got
their descriptions of what happened, but you didn't get themselves,
because it was unfaceable. None of them could speak out about what
they had felt and what it had done to them inside themselves. I
kept thinking, `Why isn't anyone asking these questions?'''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sereny decided that she would ask the questions, looking at
individual guilt as a way to examine society's collective
culpability. That is why she obsessively studied every available
document and spoke to every available acquaintance and colleague
about Speer, building up to the point where she confronted him with
the biggest paradox of his life: that although he was in Hitler's
inner circle during the worst excesses of the Third Reich, he
professed to know nothing about the systematic extermination of the
Jews.
</P>
<P>
   And that is why, after covering the trial of Mary Bell in 1968
(she wrote an earlier book about it, called ``The Case of Mary
Bell''), Ms. Sereny waited nearly 30 years for the chance to meet
Ms. Bell face to face, and to question her until she was satisfied
with the explanations. ``In all these things, what I want to find
out is what that makes them capable of doing what they do, or
incapable of doing what they didn't do,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Referring again to World War II, she said: ``Like all of my
generation across the Western world, whether Jews or Christians, we
have been deeply affected by what the Germans did. It was the worst
kind of inhumanity, such an enormous wrong, and we were all in my
generation part of it. Because of it, humanity lost something. We
lost a moral part of ourselves, and somehow we must regain this
part. Maybe my way of regaining it is by doing what I'm doing.''

 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Call it a sign of the times.
</P>
<P>
   Late last week a publicist called, peddling a new book meant to
replace ``Security Analysis'' by Benjamin Graham and David Dodd,
the 1934 bible for value investors. ``Badly outmoded and out of
date,'' the pitch went.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the tome is more timely than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Now that corporate earnings and the upward momentum of stock
prices are slowing, Graham and Dodd make perfect summer reading for
investors looking to get their bearings. Indeed, the authors'
description of market strategies prevailing in the pre-Crash 1920s
_ the so-called New-Era Theory of investing _ is eerie:
</P>
<P>
   (italics)The notion that the desirability of a common stock was
entirely independent of its price seems incredibly absurd. Yet the
new-era theory led directly to this thesis. If a public utility
stock was selling at 35 times its maximum recorded earnings,
instead of 10 times its average earnings, which was the pre-boom
standard, the conclusion to be drawn was not that the stock was now
too high but merely that the standard of value had been raised.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of judging the market price by established standards of
value, the new era based its standards of value upon the market
price. Hence, all upper limits disappeared, not only upon the price
at which a stock could sell, but even upon the price at which it
would deserve to sell.(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   Fast-forward 60 years or so and try to imagine what Graham and
Dodd would think of Ameritrade, the discount brokerage, selling for
1,304 times earnings; Intuit, the personal-finance software maker,
fetching 342 times earnings, or America Online, going for 199 times
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   (italics)But most paradoxical was the early abandonment of
research and analysis in guiding investment-trust policies.
(Investment trusts were the 1920s version of mutual funds.)
Investment had now become so beautifully simple that research was
unnecessary and statistical data a mere encumbrance. The investment
process consisted merely of finding prominent companies with a
rising trend of earnings and then buying their shares regardless of
price. Hence, the sound policy was to buy only what everyone else
was buying _ a select group of highly popular and exceedingly
expensive issues, appropriately known as the ``blue chips.''(end
italics)
</P>
<P>
   Today's select group includes Coca-Cola, Dell Computer, Lucent
Technologies, Cisco Systems, Intel, Excite, Compaq Computer,
Amazon.com, Home Depot, General Electric, Yahoo, MCI
Communications, Worldcom, America Online and Microsoft. The Nifty
15.
</P>
<P>
   David Dreman, head of Dreman Value Management, finds the
increasing divergence between the Nifty 15 and the rest of the
market disturbingly similar to what preceded the nation's last
bitter bear market, in 1973-74. ``But the multiples are higher this
time around,'' he said. ``Back in the 1970s, we had stocks with
great stories and great earnings. A lot of the stories now are
concepts without major earnings as yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Ominously, many of the Nifty 15 fell on Friday, even during a
morning when the market averages were strong. It was the first time
these stocks had weakened in the face of market strength.
</P>
<P>
   (italics)There emerged a companion theory that common stocks
represented the most profitable and therefore the most desirable
media for long-term investment. This gospel was based upon a
certain amount of research, showing that diversified lists of
common stocks had regularly increased in value over stated
intervals of time for many years past.(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   Finally there's this similarity between the 1920s mood on Wall
Street and the day traders and Internet stock jockeys crowding in
and out of stocks these days:
</P>
<P>
   (italics)Making money in the stock market was now the easiest
thing in the world. It was only necessary to buy ``good'' stocks,
regardless of price, and then to let nature take her upward course.
Countless people asked themselves, ``Why work for a living when a
fortune can be made in Wall Street without working?'' The ensuing
migration from business into the financial district resembled the
famous gold rush to the Klondike, with the not unimportant
difference that there really was gold in the Klondike.(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   Out of date, indeed.

   (ART ADV: Graphic of defensive investing strategies is being sent
to NYT graphic clients. Non-subscribers can make individual
purchase by calling (888) 603-1036 or (888) 346-9867.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Never mind the yen, the ruble, the dress.
</P>
<P>
   They've all been mentioned as contributors to the latest bouts
of queasiness in the long-running bull market, but sorting out the
causes can take investors only so far.
</P>
<P>
   For many people with savings tied up in stocks, it may be time
to make defensive maneuvers to protect gains and help minimize the
risk of losses.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive investing once was considered relatively simple: Move
money out of stocks and into bonds, precious metals, certificates
of deposit and cash until the storm blows over. Now the concept is
more complicated _ and the alternatives aren't so obvious.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, many experts are not keen on automatically
parking large chunks of money in bonds because interest rates
generated by almost all fixed-income investments are abysmally low.
</P>
<P>
   Gold, another historical haven, continues to languish near its
lows for the year, with little sign of change. Even some types of
stocks, including shares of basic foods and consumer products
companies _ often seen as refuges in previous downturns because of
their steady earnings _ have lost some allure and are viewed as
overpriced.
</P>
<P>
   To some strategists, defensive investing is more akin to highly
selective investing: carefully evaluating individual stocks and
mutual funds and deciding if they are potential bargains. The first
step, investment experts agree, is to take a reality check and
evaluate your investment gains before foraging for alternatives in
a panic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clients have told me they're getting killed in this market,''
said Rosilyn Overton, a certified financial planner in Flushing,
N.Y. ``But when I ask them to compare their net worth since the end
of last year, even with the pullback they're up 15 to 20 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   It is also appropriate to do a second kind of reality check _
assessing whether your investment allocations still meet your
investment targets and tolerance for risk. Because of the market's
run-up the last three years, many investors may not realize just
how much of their money is in stocks.
</P>
<P>
   At the Dreyfus Corp., Timothy M. Ghriskey, head of value
equities, offered this test: ``If this little correction makes you
nervous, you're probably overexposed.''
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't necessarily mean it's time to move all money out of
stocks. Like many other market professionals, Ghriskey believes it
is premature to say a bear market has arrived or that corporate
earnings are about to evaporate. As one sign of that, he pointed to
how well the stocks of smaller financial service companies
performed during the market jolts last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``On Tuesday, financial stocks were the worst-performing sector
of the S&AMP;P, but the best-performing sector of the Russell 2000
small-stock index,'' he said. ``That tells us people aren't so much
worried about a recession as they are worried about the
international economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Ghriskey said he saw bargains in financial services stocks,
which took a battering recently. Ghriskey said he likes companies
including Citicorp, Chubb and First Union partly because market
selloffs had obscured their underlying health.
</P>
<P>
   Chubb, for example, is in the middle of a share buyback, a sign
that the company is confident about its prospects. First Union, he
said, is increasing its reliance on stable, fee-based income that
comes from generating business as an investment adviser, not just
as a commercial bank.
</P>
<P>
   Sheryl Rowan, a senior investment strategist at Merrill Lynch,
said she liked financial services, too, particularly insurance.
``We think it's an area that's ripe for consolidation, but it's an
industry that also has some good fundamentals and above-average
dividend yield,'' she said. ``The market doesn't seem to be
rewarding many of these companies, however.''
</P>
<P>
   She declined to identify her picks but said ``the ones that look
most inexpensive to us are property and casualty companies, which
have some of the best dividend yields, as well as reasonable growth
in earnings.''

<P>
   Evan Harrel, who helps manage the Aim Value fund, said he saw
value in financial services, including insurance, and in cable
television; three of his top 10 holdings are American International
Group, Chase Manhattan and Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
   Another sector that may be poised for growth is real estate
investment trusts. Many of these stocks, including Vornado Realty
Trust and Crescent Real Estate Equities, had been weakening for
most of the year but now seem poised for a rebound.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rowan suggested REIT stocks as defensive purchases, though
she did not specify her choices. She likes the high dividend yields
that many REITs offer, and said a good portion of the money that
many REITs had been using to buy real estate might now be used for
stock buybacks.
</P>
<P>
   Utility stocks, another historically favored sector in market
retreats because of their consistent earnings and dividend payouts,
also look underpriced to some analysts.
</P>
<P>
   The average price-to-earnings ratio of utility stocks covered by
Merrill Lynch is about half that of the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock
index. Utilities have also shown a notable resilience in the face
of the overall market's volatility.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ms. Rowan said, mergers and deregulation in the utility
industry meant that many of these stocks no longer offered the
safety that once attracted investors in uncertain times. ``We've
seen a blurring of the line that separates the pure, defensive,
regulated utility,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're recommending utility stocks,'' Ms. Rowan added, ``but we
like them less because of their defensive nature and more because
we have some really competitive utilities that do have very high
dividend yields, and that are trading at a discount to the
market.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A broken line of strong but brief thunderstorms will rumble
across the eastern Great Lakes region as a cold front slicing
southeast wedges under and lifts humid air moving north from the
Ohio Valley. The far western flank of the front will stall over the
northern Plains, setting the stage for clusters of strong storms
over the Dakotas and Nebraska, where a stream of humid air from the
south intersects the front.
</P>
<P>
   A compact group of showers and thunderstorms will exit the
central Appalachians early Saturday and head into New York and
western New England, gradually dissipating as it proceeds
northeastward. But it will leave sufficient low-level moisture
behind so that another round of showers and thunderstorms will
develop over upstate New York and northwest New England later
Saturday as a jet stream disturbance in Canada brushes the region.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, clusters of showers and thunderstorms, some heavy,
will erupt over the South from Texas to the Southeast Seaboard as a
trough of low pressure at 18,000 feet swings slowly east over a
tropical and unstable air mass. Flash flooding is possible.
</P>
<P>
   Isolated, strong thunderstorms will flare up from eastern Oregon
to the northern Rockies as a cool front lifts warm surface air. The
passage of the front will mark an easing of the heat that has
gripped much of the Northwest this week. Farther south, afternoon
and evening thunderstorms will bubble up over the mountains of the
West from the Sierra Nevada of California to the central and
southern Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Red Flag Warning
</P>
<P>
   A ``red flag warning'' for wildfires was issued for the
Washington Cascades Friday. It has been extremely hot over the
interior Northwest during the past several weeks. Moreover,
rainfall has been sparse, which is not unusual, given that summer
is the region's dry season. Friday, a cool front bore down on
Washington from the Gulf of Alaska, signaling an eventual easing of
the heat. The changing of the guard in air masses was forecasted to
take place with high-based thunderstorms, whose rain would
evaporate before reaching the tinder-dry ground but whose lightning
would spark fires.

OUT-OF-TOWN KIDS HAMPERED IN HELPING AGING PARENTS  
 (EMBARGOED FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 16) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MAUREEN WEST  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - ``You can do everything possible by long distance, but
there's still that knowledge that you can't go over there in the
middle of the night.''
</P>
<P>
   That is 42-year-old Bonnie Hughes Marcus, expressing the anxiety
she feels about living in Ohio and trying to be a good,
long-distance daughter to her 81- and 82-year-old parents, Felice
and Warren Hughes, who live in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``I epitomize the sandwich generation, raising three kids
between 8 and 17 and, more and more, assuming a caregiving role for
my parents,'' said Bonnie who lives in Shaker Heights, a suburb of
Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   She believes that their family has a strong foundation of love,
but it's still hard for her to know if she's giving too much or too
little, she explained.
</P>
<P>
   ``In your 40s and 50s, you're faced with some pretty grueling
family issues. It can be overwhelming unless you figure a way to
find your balance,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bonnie is hardly alone in her situation, according to David
Helgeson, a psychologist who helps families with elder-care issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm seeing many more middle-age adults these days who want to
know how to deal more effectively with their parents,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also gets an earful of complaints from older patients about
their middle-aged children, who either don't call enough, or who
wrongly (say the seniors) think their parents are going senile.
</P>
<P>
   Helgeson sees denial on both ends: Many older people don't want
to admit the loss of their capabilities, and their kids refuse to
see their parents as aging because it reminds them of how old they
are getting, or because they don't think they have the time or
money to help them. They will chat about the weather rather than
about what's obvious and important.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, a serious or even life-threatening event has to occur
with a parent before everyone will face the situation. Solving the
problem is difficult under any circumstances, but it's compounded
when the parents live far away.
</P>
<P>
   Bonnie and her brothers kept out of their parents' financial and
legal affairs until five years ago, when Warren Hughes had a
life-threatening aneurysm and high-risk surgery. Bonnie frankly
discussed finances and health care options with her father. She
knew he had prepared a will, but she didn't know where it was
located or who he had named as an executor. They wrote a living
will and a medical power of attorney, just in case anything went
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the family was relieved that he came through surgery
beautifully and that family financial affairs remained in order,
Warren's wife, Felice, was diagnosed with Alzheimer's.
</P>
<P>
   Warren tried to handle the care of his wife on his own. But as
the disease advanced, he hired someone to help three days a week,
then five, then seven. But even then it became too much for him.
</P>
<P>
   The Hughes children didn't know their father was having so much
difficulty until a year and a half ago, when Warren had to be
hospitalized for stress for five days.
</P>
<P>
   After that, even Warren couldn't deny that caring for her had
become too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dad was great,'' Bonnie said. ``He called us all home and we
had a meeting in a conference room he had arranged at his church.
He wanted us to meet in a place where we could try to make an
unemotional decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The family agreed it was time to put Felice into a nursing home.
They surveyed 15 homes, finally picking one close to her doctors.
</P>
<P>
   On most Saturdays and Sundays, Warren and his dog, Bordeaux,
visit Felice.
</P>
<P>
   ``She recognizes the poodle and me,'' said Warren.
</P>
<P>
   Four days each week, Warren volunteers as a counselor to
families going through similar experiences. He takes that work as
seriously as he ever did his career as an FBI agent.
</P>
<P>
   He tells other families that it is important that at least one
person besides the spouse should be there to help make decisions
and communicate with the family. Among his children, Bonnie is that
person. She helps him make decisions and she watches over his own
needs.
</P>
<P>
   Because she couldn't be in town to help her father manage her
mother's care, Bonnie hired a geriatric care manager to make
professional visits. The monthly report usually includes a note
about ``Mr. Hughes.''
</P>
<P>
   If the geriatric care manager sees a possible problem, she calls
the doctor directly or Warren.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted someone extra who would be objective. Whose
observations wouldn't be tied to emotion,'' said Bonnie. The
monitoring costs $65 a month, but she says it is worth it.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after her mother moved to the care facility, she and her
brothers strongly encouraged their father to move from the family's
3-bedroom ranch home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was our thinking that he would be better off in a smaller
place,'' said Bonnie.
</P>
<P>
   But Warren didn't agree and there were family arguments.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is all trial and error,'' she said. ``I have learned that I
have to be respectful of what he is going through as well. He was
going through a grieving period, too, and losing his house and
losing Mom to this disease in one big swoop was too much for him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As a daughter or son you may believe a change is for the best,
but they may not want that change,'' said Bonnie. ``If it isn't a
crisis situation, it should be their decision,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Psychologist Helgeson agreed, adding ``you can never really
become your parent's parent.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonnie gives this advice to other long-distance children: Stay
in touch and gather lots of information about options.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have learned to say, `Why don't you think about this?'
instead of telling him what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Next to her hometown telephone book sits Phoenix phone books,
used regularly to help her father find repair, landscaping or
cleaning services.
</P>
<P>
   She talks with doctors to check up on her parents' health and
she knows people in their church.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we try to get out and visit as regularly as we can,'' she
said. Almost every month, one of the Hugheses' children visits for
a few days or a week.
</P>
<P>
   They also encourage Warren to travel to them, but at his age
travel is becoming more difficult. And he doesn't like missing his
visits with Felice.

<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ David Graham, a convicted murderer, expects
many to think him a liar. He knows that the detailed account he
wrote describing his involvement in the brutal murder of
16-year-old Adrianne Jones sealed his fate. ``I knew when I signed
the confession that was pretty much my future,'' Graham said. ``I
didn't think it at the time, but when I look back, I realize that
it's going to be hard for anyone to believe me. What can I do?''
During a wide-ranging interview this week in the basement of
Tarrant County Jail, Graham, 20, was subdued as he talked about the

CALIFORNIA TO GET NEW AREA CODES AS PHONE DEMAND RISES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC BRAZIL  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ California, which had no telephone area codes at
all in 1947, is about to get its 23rd. Ant that's not the end of
it.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 24, people now living south of the Madera County line in
the sprawling Central Valley 209 area code, including Fresno, will
find themselves in the 559 area.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, new area codes will be created within 310 in Los
Angeles County and 619 in San Diego County.
</P>
<P>
   And in San Mateo, northern Santa Clara and part of Santa Cruz
counties, where people are just getting used to 650, yet another
split is in the works.
</P>
<P>
   When 650 was born on Aug. 2, 1997, then-regional area code
administrator Douglas Hescox said that it was ``expected to
accommodate the need for new phone numbers for about 12 years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The unprecedented demand for telecommunication services has
caused the life span to be much shorter and even more difficult to
project,'' said Hescox's successor, Joe Cocke of Lockheed
Martin-IMS.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed Martin-IMS is the Washington, D.C.-based company that
won a contract in January from the Federal Communications
Commission to administer area codes nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Now, prodded by telephone service providers, Lockheed Martin-IMS
is aiming to activate a new area code within the 650 area, possibly
within two years, Cocke said.
</P>
<P>
   The new 559 area will be California's 10th new area code in as
many years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Relief planning,'' the process whereby a new area code is
created, is triggered when the number of unused telephone numbers
dwindles. That number varies from area to area, Cocke said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to give a 24-month notice that a new area code is going
to be implemented, but that hasn't happened all the time,'' Cocke
said. ``It's a pretty complicated process and, in addition to that,
we have to wait for approval from the California PUC.''
</P>
<P>
   The Public Utilities Commission must approve all new area codes.
</P>
<P>
   California law requires that phone companies offer customers six
months of ``permissive dialing,'' during which they can use the old
area code numbers after the creation of a new one.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the proliferation of area codes assert that the
shortage of numbers is the artificial creation of phone companies,
which are buying them up and, in effect, warehousing them. Others
say that the voracious appetite for telecommunications, including
cell phones and pagers, plus the entry of new service providers
into the market, is responsible for the shortage.
</P>
<P>
   Cocke said his company, a neutral party under contract with the
Federal Communications Commission to administer area codes,
couldn't investigate the warehousing charge, which phone companies
say is false.
</P>
<P>
   The creation of a new area code within 310 will be an
``overlay,'' that is, new phone numbers added in that area will
simply be given a different area code. Next door neighbors, even
desk mates in offices, may have phones with different area codes.
</P>
<P>
   The overlay will be a first for California.
</P>
<P>
   Creating new area codes isn't cheap, even with the lead time
ostensibly built into the process. Estimates run as high as $40
million and include the costs of reprogramming computers and home
burglar alarms, changing business cards and stationery and other
standard business items that list phone numbers.

NEW YORK FILM FESTIVAL WILL SHOWCASE FILMS FROM 26 COUNTRIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JESSE McKINLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New York Film Festival has announced the schedule
for its 36th annual presentation at Avery Fisher Hall, which opens
on Sept. 25 with Woody Allen's ``Celebrity'' and closes on Oct. 11
with ``The Dreamlife of Angels,'' the first film by the French
director Erick Zonca. Zonca's film, whose two young stars shared
best-actress honors at the Cannes International Film Festival in
May, follows the story of a pair of impoverished French women who
forge a volatile friendship.
</P>
<P>
   The festival, organized by the Film Society of Lincoln Center,
will offer 26 films from 15 countries, with a large contingent of
American and French directors. Its centerpiece presentation, Oct. 4
and 5 at Alice Tully Hall, will be ``Black Cat, White Cat,''
directed by Emir Kusturica. The film is a black comedy about a
Gypsy settlement along the polluted banks of the Danube River.
</P>
<P>
   Other highlights of the festival include a special presentation
of ``Strike,'' the first film made by the Soviet director Sergei
Eisenstein, on Oct. 1 at the Walter Reade Theater. The showing
commemorates the 100th anniversary of the director's birth and will
be accompanied by a live performance of a new score for the film by
the Alloy Orchestra. The Swedish director Ingmar Bergman will also
be honored with a series of special screenings of his newest film,
``The Presence of a Clown,'' on Oct. 3 and 4 at the Walter Reade.
</P>
<P>
   That theater will also be home to a retrospective of the work of

`HENRY V': HIS KINGDOM FOR A PARKING LOT 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes at end of review.) 
(lb) 
 By ANITA GATES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In most productions of ``Henry V,'' you do not see a
man who isn't even a cast member walk onstage, get into his
spruce-green Honda Civic and drive away. But those are the chances
you take when you stage Shakespeare in a parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   The Expanded Arts theater company deserves the praise it has
received for its 3-year-old series, Free Shakespeare in the
Park(ing) Lot.
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say, however, that Kenneth Branagh has anything
to worry about. The company does an admirable job under the
circumstances (the competition of planes, buses, pedestrians, an
H&AMP;H Bagels truck crossing the lot, a gray plastic bag mysteriously
levitating its way across the stage), but it doesn't completely
succeed in bringing the characters' emotions to life.
</P>
<P>
   This ``Henry V,'' however, has a rousing beginning _ Henry's
drinking buddies singing about ``a drop of good beer'' _ and a
charming ending. And if the battle scenes, played against a wall of
graffiti, have the look of the Jets and Sharks' opening scenes in
``West Side Story,'' there's a kind of circular logic to that.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly McAllister (brother of the play's director, Jerry
McAllister) is a good-looking, boyish Henry who convincingly gives
up his youthful wanton ways, virtually overnight, when he becomes
king. But he takes the St. Crispin's Day speech, every Henry's
moment of glory, and turns it into bluster. He somewhat redeems
himself, with humor, wooing Katherine (Amy Speace) in the final
scene.
</P>
<P>
   Players in relatively small parts have some nice moments,
particularly Jason Brown as the Dauphin, Lee Winston as the Duke of
Burgundy and Chris Santangelo as the Earl of Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Speace makes a believable, desirable Katherine, wearing a
rich, dark gown. (Most of the other cast members perform in jeans
or downtown black, with or without robes thrown over their
contemporary clothes.) And the hanging scene, which has been
stylized within an inch of its life, works beautifully.
</P>
<P>
   ``Henry V'' continues Wednesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m. at
the corner of Broome and Ludlow streets, through Aug. 29.
</P>
<P>

ADVICE FOR ADULT CHILDREN

   UNDATED - How to help your aging parents: &QL; 
_Recognize that we all age differently. Today's elders have
different health needs than did their parents. Gather as much
knowledge as you can about the aging process so you will know what
is normal aging and what is not. &QL; 
_Children should focus on ``being with,'' instead of ``doing for''
their parents, especially when a parent is in the generally healthy
65-to-75 age bracket.  &QL; 
_Know your family style. Some families express emotional intimacy;
others are more distant. A goal for midlife is to develop an
adult-to-adult relationship with your parents, if you don't have
one already. &QL; 
_How often you should call and write depends on the family and the
health of the parents. But when an older parent begins to show
signs of even mild impairment, it is important to contact them
frequently. &QL; 
_Parents often want to feel needed and useful. They want to be
productive members of the family, but often aren't given the
opportunity. New ways for them to be productive and helpful in the
family may need to be explored. &QL; 
_Let your parents control their own decision-making. But if you
start to see severe memory impairment or a series of poor
decisions, it's time to step in. &QL; 
_If a parent becomes ill, establish an action plan that involves
all family members, with one of the children taking the lead. &QL; 
_Helping your parents get their financial and legal affairs in
order may prevent headaches later. Having a will, a living will,
and medical and general powers of attorney are vital when parents
are unable to make decisions.  &QL; 
_Keep a list of the medications your parents take. &QL; 
_After a loss of a spouse, even the most independent of parents may
need more from their children. Spend some time with them and help
assess their changing needs.  &QL; 
_The key to long-distance care is planning ahead and communicating
regularly with your parents, other family members, your parents'
friends and neighbors, doctors, bankers, lawyers and other people
who can offer assistance. &QL; 
_Children of Aging Parents, a national nonprofit organization
dedicated to assisting adult children and their aging parents, also
has information for family members, 800-227-7294. &QL;

 By PETER TRUELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Michael Metz is relieved that the stock market has retreated
more than 10 percent from the dizzying heights of mid-July.
</P>
<P>
   If the remarkable bull run had continued, stocks would have just
had that much further to fall and would have caused greater havoc
than they are now, said Metz, one of the market's leading bears.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the reality principle is coming back to Wall Street,''
Metz said last Wednesday at the CIBC Oppenheimer Corp.'s
headquarters in the World Financial Center in lower Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is that Asia is not a passing fancy,'' he said.
``The idea, which was the consensus going into the summer _ that
you would have a resumption of 10 percent or 12 percent earnings
gains in the second half of the year _ is disappearing.''
</P>
<P>
   Metz, a managing director in CIBC Oppenheimer's equity research
department, said he expected cash to outperform the main indexes
over the next 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   Such predictions are not new for Metz, 69. He has been calling
stocks overpriced for four years. But he is not a perennial bear.
He advocated aggressively buying stocks during the gulf war in
1991.
</P>
<P>
   He also advocated buying stocks in 1982, the dawn of the longest
bull market in history. ``Stocks were as cheap as mud then,'' he
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Metz also wryly acknowledges his forecasting errors. ``I have
been wrong about the direction of the market,'' he said. ``But I
still think it has been overvalued.''
</P>
<P>
   A frequent pundit in print and on television, Metz has his
critics and defenders.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph V. Battipaglia, the chief investment strategist at
Gruntal &AMP; Co. and a leading bull, criticized Metz _ with whom he
has sparred often _ as being overly pessimistic, particularly on
oil and commodity prices in the early and mid-1990s, and on the
prospects for American productivity improvements. ``Michael has
been a bit of an alarmist about certain things,'' Battipaglia said.
</P>
<P>
   But Metz also has his defenders. ``Michael Metz has been
victimized by the bull market,'' said James Grant, editor of
Grant's Interest Rate Observer. ``He's the `yes, but' guy in a
gee-whiz world. I am certain when all this is over, he will be seen
as more of a prophet than a fool.''
</P>
<P>
   Metz said he did not think the market's latest gyrations
presaged a financial Armageddon. But he painted an alarming picture
about the collapse in oil prices, which has been caused partly by
reduced demand from Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``If oil prices stay at $12 a barrel for the next six or nine
months, you can say goodbye to the house of Saud, to Yeltsin, to
Mexico, to Venezuela and to Indonesia,'' he said. ``If you think
oil prices are going to stay here for the next six to nine months,
my advice is to sell everything. Because you're going to be in a
period of unspeakable political instability around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Metz suggested that United States policy-makers should put
pressure on friendly oil-producers like Norway, Britain and Mexico
to cut production and bolster prices.
</P>
<P>
   Given his pessimistic views, it is not surprising that Metz
warns investors to be conservative, accrue cash, pay down debts and
selectively acquire beaten-down stocks like semiconductor companies
and undervalued second-tier stocks in the United States and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hong Kong hotel chains are selling at a huge discount to
book,'' he said. ``There probably won't be another hotel built in
Hong Kong for 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   He also sees bargains in some energy stocks. ``I'd look at a lot
of middle-tier exploration and development companies, and
particularly those in North America. I was thinking of things like
Pennzoil, maybe Swift Energy, Apache, Burlington Resources.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Metz said he was more convinced than ever that
the market has been in the grips of the bear since April, when the
vast population of stocks began to slide, eventually pulling bigger
stocks along with it this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have got an overcrowded, overinvested universe of market
participants against a background where the so-called fundamentals
are deteriorating,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He ridiculed Wall Street analysts who expect corporate earnings
growth to continue at unprecedented levels for years. ``If you
think about it, if you extrapolate on that, you're going to have
earnings higher than revenues at some point. And that's not going
to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Metz was Oppenheimer's investment strategist for more than seven
years until April. ``Right at the peak,'' as he put it.
</P>
<P>
   As for talk in the market that CIBC Oppenheimer was eager to
replace Metz with a more bullish strategist, Metz said, ``It's an
interesting observation, but in any case, I was wrong'' about the
market. CIBC Oppenheimer has not yet named a new strategist to
replace Metz.
</P>
<P>
   The huge run-up in the stock market reflects a fundamental
change in the people who are investing, Metz said. Americans who
once put savings in banks now plow it into mutual funds and 401(k)
plans, lured by higher rates of return. Such a shift, he said,
``creates enormous vulnerability for the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   It has given rise to some misleading canards, too, in Metz's
view. ``People talk about the baby boomers saving more,'' he said.
``It happens not to be true. What's happened is that the American
householder has depended mostly on appreciation in the stock market
to do his savings for him.''
</P>
<P>
   So, does Metz feel vindicated now that the market finally seems
to be retreating? ``No,'' Metz said, but he recalled John Maynard
Keynes's warning about the foolishness of trying to impose ``a
rational structure on an irrational institution,'' like the stock
market. ``Every once in a while,'' Metz said, ``it's wonderful when
it seems to be more rational.''

CHIC LITTLE NUMBERS: THE HIPLESS ELITE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday Aug. 16)  
 (bl)  
 By RUTH LA FERLA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Chantal William, the owner of the G.C. William
boutique on Madison Avenue near 85th Street, looked on in amusement
the other day as Romy Schreiber breezed in, her fashion antennae
twitching. As Ms. William recalled, no sooner had her client
crossed the threshold than she made a beeline for a rack of little
black dresses, pleading to try on a sleeveless model sparkling with
beads. ``I picked it out myself, it was my style,'' Ms. Schreiber
said later.
</P>
<P>
   Pressed to define that style, she fumbled for the right word,
settling on ``cool,'' an adjective she applied to other items on
her most-wanted list, which ran from twin sets and pendant chokers
to long skinny skirts, bell-bottoms and tiny kilts like one she had
just acquired by Burberrys.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Schreiber also obligingly listed her favorite makes and
models _ Calvin Klein, DKNY, Kate Moss and Cindy Crawford _
chanting their names in the sing-song rhythm of a small girl
skipping rope.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Schreiber is 9. At an age when many of her contemporaries
are decked out in overalls and box-pleated skirts, her own
hyper-hip fashion choices conjure up an image that's two parts Posh
Spice, one part Diana, the Princess of Wales.
</P>
<P>
   She would recognize a kindred spirit in Kristina Obermeier, 10,
who was spied perusing the racks in Saks Fifth Avenue's girls'
department. With her blond hair pulled back in a chignon like her
idol, the Olympic figure skater Tara Lipinski, Kristina streaked
toward the DKNY rack, leaving her mother in the dust. She gazed
Frisbee-eyed at a calf-length, column-shaped jumper that could
easily pass muster at her parochial school but flirted with fashion
just the same. ``It's black and I love to wear black,'' she said,
with the authority of a budding style maven. ``It goes with
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Both girls cultivate a look poised at fashion's cutting edge.
Only a few years ago, it would have marked them as members of a hip
elite, their tastes outside the mainstream. But to hear the experts
tell it, these days fashion-forward little girls have lots of
company. America's youngest fashion consumers, age 10 and under,
represent a huge market, whose profile is rapidly shifting, said
Traci Mitchell, the executive editor of Children's Business, a
fashion trade monthly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of little girls want to look grown up and
fashion-conscious _ it's a big trend,'' Ms. Mitchell said, adding
that although parents hold the purse strings, their style-savvy
offspring are increasingly making the buying decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Known as ``tweens'' in the fashion trade, there were 9.5 million
girls between ages 5 and 9 in 1996, a figure that will grow to 9.7
million by 2000, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. No longer do
many of them want to dress in the crew-neck sweaters, cotton
pullovers and starchy frocks their mothers wore as children and
might try to steer their daughters toward.
</P>
<P>
   ``My retail clients tell me that starting at about age 7, but
sometimes as young as 3 or 4, children start making the fashion
choices and the buying decisions,'' said Diane Rattican, an
importer for high-style European children's lines like Naf Naf,
Chevignon, Kenzo Jungle and Elle. ``They come in with their
parents, their minds already made up. And if the parents make the
selection, they often end up returning it because their kids
refused to wear it.''
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to cater to these young customers, stores and
designers have lately flooded the market with scaled-down versions
of clothes that might have marched straight off the women's
ready-to-wear runways for this season _ looks like flared pants,
Capris, long slinky skirts, fitted shirts and ribbed sweaters.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kids are so educated _ they know what they want, and
they're not shy about letting you know,'' Ms. William said. ``A
9-year-old will tell you: `I'd like the same skirt as my mom. I
love the way Cindy Crawford looks in that spaghetti-strap dress.'
They see W at home on the coffee table and they use it like a
catalog.''
</P>
<P>
   They are far more likely, however, to take their style cues from
a diversity of pop culture sources: the Delia's catalog of teen-age
clothing or Seventeen magazine, pilfered from an older sister's
dressing table, and television programming targeted to teen-agers,
like MTV, ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' and ``Moesha,'' the sitcom
starring Brandy, a 19-year-old pop diva with a rabid preteen
following (and who is on the cover of Seventeen next month).
</P>
<P>
   Children of the VCR, tweens have also had their fashion
precociousness shaped by endless viewings of movies like
``Clueless'' and ``Spice World,'' in which Posh Spice, the soigne
member of the Spice Girls, muses dreamily, ``Should I wear my Gucci
tonight?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Girls get the message that it's fine to look like miniature
adults from the media, which is more powerful now than ever,'' said
Nancy Samalin, a parent-educator and the author of ``Loving Your
Child Is Not Enough'' (Penguin-Viking, 1987), a manual of child
rearing. She argues that the trend is not good for children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids are bombarded with brand names and images of teen-aged
girls dressed in tight little black outfits, and they're going to
want to emulate that,'' she continued. ``It's a parent's job to
help them resist that temptation by limiting the amount of time a
child spends shopping, and being more selective about the kinds of
TV and movies she sees.''
</P>
<P>
   But many parents find nothing wrong with a child who has an
advanced sense of style. ``I'm glad my girls respond to fashion,''
said Myriam Schrieber, a jewelry designer and the mother of Romy.
``I think that's a very ladylike thing to be into. Trends aren't
something you should learn about all of a sudden when you're in
college.''
</P>
<P>
   Some parents draw a line between the trendy and the tarty.
Jennifer Blaikie, an elementary school teacher in New York whose
daughters are 8 and 6, said, ``If she had her way, my eldest would
look like Baby Spice.'' She copes by compromising. ``If my daughter
wants to wear two ponytails on top of her head, that's fine,'' she
said. ``But she's not wearing sexy little clothes when she's 8. I
don't think that's teaching the right lesson.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Retailers like Ms. William gently nudge their young clients in
the direction of chic. Seeded like Skittles throughout her boutique
are current issues of Seventeen, In Style and People, replete with
glossy images of Cameron Diaz, Christina Ricci and Dominique Swain,
the star of ``Lolita,'' sheathed in form-fitting dresses and
thigh-slit skirts.
</P>
<P>
   At Marsha D.D. on Lexington Avenue near 88th Street, racks and
tables overflow with velvet side-slit miniskirts, tank tops and
fake-fur-collared cardigans, shown not in pastels but in fashion's
current dusky palette of eggplant, black and gray. ``This is a
children's store, but you won't see any pink,'' said Marsha Drogin
Dayan, who owns the shop and a companion boys' store next door.
``Rejecting pink is a political statement for this age group,'' she
said. ``When you get to be 7 or 8, by giving it up you show that
you're not a baby anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dayan's clients are just as likely to turn up their noses at
puffy sleeves, Peter Pan collars, and smocking and shirring,
holding out instead for such badges of cool as ankle-length skirts
from Junior Kraze ($42), hip-clutching stretch denim flares from
JNCO (about $35 to $50), little black dresses by Nicole Miller ($90
to $120) and black pants. ``A 10-year-old is on the same quest for
the perfect black pant that you are,'' said Ms. Dayan, who
cultivates in her diminutive patrons a stripped-down modernist
sensibility. ``I think of them as future Prada customers,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   A similarly spare, though more pointedly luxurious esthetic
prevails at Barneys New York; its children's collection is filled
with doll-size knits by Missoni, East-meets-West down-filled
jackets by Kenzo, tent-shaped dresses by Dries van Noten and A-line
jumpers by Moschino, fattened up with the same padding and quilting
that dominated the runways last spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``More and more designers are making kids' clothes modeled on
their adult collections,'' said Phyllis Pressman, the executive
vice president and general merchandise manager of Chelsea Passage,
Barneys' housewares and children's department.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Pressman, who does most of the buying for the children's
collection, said the famous-designer items sell, despite their
sometimes stratospheric prices. One of the store's biggest
children's hits of last season was an Hermes jacket for $400.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Gap, purveyor of pocket T-shirts and cargo pants to the
children's mass market, has lately traded up in the hope of
appeasing customers' appetite for high style. The company plans to
open a large Baby Gap store on Fifth Avenue at 54th Street in
October, showcasing a line of sweaters in the season's hottest
luxury fabric _ cashmere _ alongside a black velvet mock-turtle
bodysuit, like the top Sharon Stone wore at the Oscars two years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these sophisticated togs are meant to catch the eye not
of the toddlers, but of their trend-following elders, who snap up
looks priced from $18 to $198 _ never mind that their offspring
will streak them with Play-Doh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents tend to see their children as extensions of
themselves,'' Ms. Mitchell of Children's Business said. ``They
don't want them to wear just anything. They don't want clothes that
are frilly or emblazoned with cute cartoon characters. Cutesiness
is not appealing.''
</P>
<P>
   When Betty Obermeier's daughter Kristina raced toward her
clutching a leopard-print coat at Saks last week, Mrs. Obermeier
beamed approvingly. ``She could wear that to church,'' she said.
``Why not? At least on a Sunday when she wasn't altar serving.''
She was less ecstatic, however, when her 7-year-old, Melissa,
brought over a smocked dress. ``It's too babyish,'' she chided,
sending the youngster skittering back to the racks.
</P>
<P>
   After 10 years in the children's clothing business, Ms. Dayan is
still astonished when her tiniest clients mimic their mothers'
shopping habits.
</P>
<P>
   ``A girl might stand for a half-hour trying on these,'' she
said, gesturing toward a basket filled with $3 silver thumb rings.
``You would think that their futures depended on picking out just
the right one. I've seen people buy diamonds in less time.''

MARC ANTHONY THOMPSON: MISERY LOVES COMPANY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JON PARELES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Marc Anthony Thompson's new songs revolve around
goodbyes. At Shine on Wednesday night, he sang about seeing a lover
and daughter he left behind, about an ex-lover who keeps him
``forever standing by,'' about visiting a senile mother who's
forgotten her son's name, and about fathers who vanished.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't go away, don't disappear,'' he sang in ``Life,'' with a
detached tone and a ragtimey beat that pretended it wasn't already
too late.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, who bills himself and his band as Chocolate Genius on
his third album, ``Black Music'' (V2), situates his songs in a
morose zone between glum folk-rock and heartsick soul music,
settling into a purgatorial lounge where comfort is no longer
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the tunes move in slow motion, with undulating guitar
lines or measured rhythm-and-blues vamps behind husky,
weather-beaten vocals. Like Mark Eitzel and, at times, Elvis
Costello, Thompson sets out to bare the misery that most pop songs
try to cushion.
</P>
<P>
   At Shine, he had superb help, with Marc Ribot on guitar
supplying bluesy solos or rippling soul-ballad chords and John
Medeski conjuring wisps of gospel organ. Chris Wood on bass and
Claude Coleman on drums stirred up even the most leisurely tempos.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in a natty gray suit, Thompson looked like a soul man,
though minus the vocal gifts; still, he's more expressive than
Jakob Dylan of the Wallflowers. And his songs are unsparing, even
sabotaging their own hints of self-pity.
</P>
<P>
   Between songs, Thompson seemed to be after what Todd Rundgren
once called ``the ever-popular tortured artist effect.'' He cursed
the large music-business contingent in the club and mocked a fan
who requested a song from his previous albums, which are out of
print.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the set, he suddenly decided his microphone stand
was in the way and tossed it into the audience, where it struck a
spectator. A tender heart may need a tough shell, but Thompson was
overdoing it.

`THE AVENGERS': SHHH! A DARING DUO HAS QUIETLY ARRIVED

   Sometimes major movie studios should be afraid to screen
expensive fiascos for the press, but they go ahead anyway. ``The
Avengers'' is Warner Brothers' would-be blockbuster that has
actually had its light hidden beneath a bushel until opening day,
and no wonder. With pseudo-suave repartee that would make Austin
Powers blush and with so many shades of ``Howard the Duck'' that
one scene depicts man-size pastel teddy bears sitting around a
conference table, it's a film to gall fans of the old television
series and perplex anyone else. I can't remember another Friday
morning show where I heard actual cries of ``Ugh!'' on the way out
the door.
</P>
<P>
   With a perfect lack of chemistry between them, Uma Thurman and
Ralph Fiennes play Mrs. Peel and John Steed, the woman in the
catsuit and the man who fights boldly with his umbrella. To put it
mildly, the dandified Fiennes does not look capable of inflicting
serious damage with that bumbershoot, and Ms. Thurman had a better
costume-party role as Poison Ivy in ``Batman Forever.'' Also in the
cast, as a madman scheming grandly to control the weather, is Sean
Connery. Connery has what is surely the silliest line of his
entire, distinguished career: ``Rain or shine, it's all mine!''
Dressed and wigged in mock-glamorous fashion, Connery has never
looked more like Burt Reynolds.
</P>
<P>
   As directed by Jeremiah Chechik and written as a parade of comic
book stunts and terminally arch quips by Don Macpherson, this
``Avengers'' begins with scenes of tea being sipped in a roadster,
then moves on to the gaudy destruction of London by evilly
manipulated weather patterns. One nice thing about a story like
this is that you know it's almost over when Big Ben blows up.
</P>
<P>
   Also here are a cloned heroine (``The Parent Trap'' does this
better), a scene featuring an army of helicopter-like
remote-controlled bug machines, and a refreshingly witty turn from
Eileen Atkins as a proper English lady who wears pearls and carries
a machine gun. And just for fun, the film has a weird male
character called Mother (Jim Broadbent) and a weird female called
Father (Fiona Shaw) who prompt the most horrible puns of all. As in
``It really isn't Mother's day!'' and ``Mother knows best!'' and so
on.
</P>
<P>
   At a pared-down, barely rational 100 minutes, ``The Avengers''
is short but not short enough.

LEADING PHILOSOPHERS SUM UP THE CENTURY, SORT OF 
</HEADLINE>
 
(subs lede to give date)   (bl)  
 By SARAH BOXER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The cameras flashed and clicked. People stood on
tip-toe to get a better look over the crowd. It was the last World
Philosophy Congress of the 20th century, and some of the most
important philosophers were onstage Wednesday evening in the
ballroom of the Marriott Hotel in Boston: Willard Van Orman Quine,
Peter Strawson and Donald Davidson.
</P>
<P>
   You might have thought that Plato, Socrates and Aristotle
themselves had assembled for a symposium. When the cameras finally
stopped flashing, the philosophers blinked and trained their
thoughts on a single question: ``What have we learned from
philosophy in the 20th century?''
</P>
<P>
   The air fairly crackled with anticipation. Quick-witted Quine _
the 90-year-old Harvard philosopher who is the premier 20th-century
proponent of naturalism, the view that philosophy is a part of
science _ went first. ``I should have thought up an answer to that
one,'' he said. ``I'm going to have to pass.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone laughed, but he wasn't kidding. Indeed, all six
philosophers seemed to be confused about whether they were supposed
to give little speeches or take part in a roundtable discussion. So
Strawson, the 79-year-old Oxford metaphysician and philosopher of
logic, was up to bat. His plan was to focus on the ambiguity of the
word ``we.'' Is the question about what we have learned
collectively or what each of us has learned individually, he asked:
``If it's the former, the possibility of any reply seems remote.
And if it's the latter, there is no shortage of replies.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say, he added, you'll find any compelling answers
among them. People mistakenly believe that only the last two
decades of philosophy are worthy of attention, Strawson said.
</P>
<P>
   Truths may be hard to come by, but at least there are ironies to
savor. Strawson offered one: Plato is generally taken to be the
founder of philosophy and Descartes the founder of modern
philosophy. And yet these days, Strawson said, ``To accuse a
philosopher of Platonism or Cartesianism is a pretty serious
charge.''
</P>
<P>
   Davidson, an 81-year-old philosopher at Berkeley who has written
about the relationship between our identity as people and our
existence as physical objects, dodged the question. So instead, he
discussed how ``very American'' philosophy had been in the 20th
century, and then reconsidered: ``To be honest, it was mostly
Harvard.'' Today, he said approvingly, it's more international.
From there, he went on to talk about the merits of air travel and
e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   The big three had refused to answer the question. But they were
joined by three less famous philosophers who were not so shy.
Marjorie Grene, 88, a spunky philosopher of science at Virginia
Polytechnic Institute, briefly worried the word ``we,'' toyed with
tackling the word ``learned'' and finally decided she had more
substantial fish to fry: ``Why is it important to do mathematical
logic? Why?'' And why, she asked, is everything still Cartesian,
relying on Descartes' separation of the mechanical brain and the
incorporeal mind? ``The only true statement he made was that he was
born in 1596,'' she said, adding that even that might have been
wrong. She added that, by the way, ``Heidegger was evil and we
ought to forget him'' and that ethics is ``just minding everyone's
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Karl-Otto Apel, a Frankfurt philosopher who practices a brand of
philosophy that he threatens to call transcendental semiotics,
reminisced about his neo-Kantian days of abstract reflection on the
classic questions: Is there an outer world? Is reality a dream? Are
there other minds? With the rise of linguistic philosophy, these
questions, he said, became ``nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   But he now laments that reflection has been completely replaced
by infinite mathematical series: ``The only philosophical thing
left is `et cetera'.''
</P>
<P>
   At last, the end of the line had come. Seyyed Hossein Nasr, the
great American scholar of Islamic philosophy, skipped over the
chance to question whether ``we'' was a collective or individual
term in favor of asking whether it included Eastern philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take it this means American philosophy,'' he said, noting
that the West had virtually ignored the philosophical traditions of
India, China, Japan and Islam. If the West paid attention to the
East, he said, it would paradoxically rediscover its own traditions
_ not the latest logical formulations but the great spiritual
``quest for truth and meaning.''
</P>
<P>
   And so the original question had been torn to shreds. The
purveyors of logic and mathematics seemed to have ceded the floor
to those who promised to bring back spirituality and reflection.
But maybe this was just because not all the logicians were disposed
to ad-lib an answer to such a big question.
</P>
<P>
   As the night wore on, Quine was given a second chance. He
replied: ``I really have nothing to add.''

THAT CURIOUS ROLLS-ROYCE DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN R. WHITE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The automobile business gets curiouser and curiouser _ and the
curious cup this week goes to the new owners of Rolls-Royce ...
whoever they are.
</P>
<P>
   That venerable British company known for its exquisite
automobiles has been sold as only the British could do it _ not
just to the highest bidder but, apparently, to all the bidders.
Volkswagen gets the factory in Crewe and the Bentley rights; BMW,
the original buyer _ or so we thought _ gets ownership of the
Rolls-Royce trademark, which it will lend to VW until 2003(?), and
the stockholders of Vickers PLC get a pile of money _ except that
some of it will have to be invested in the new BMW company building
the Royce ... is this beginning to sound like a daytime soap?
</P>
<P>
   It started as a fairy tale. Once upon a time, a poor but honest
engineer, Henry Royce, disappointed with his French automobile that
kept breaking down, built a fine English car that ran so smoothly,
one could balance a penny on its bonnet whilst the engine were
running _ Henry left school at 10 to go to work, before the grammar
lessons ``took.'' That was 1904.
</P>
<P>
   Royce's great success was noticed by Charles Rolls, a wealthy
aristocrat in the business of selling those unreliable foreign
cars, and he immediately did what the rich do when they see a poor
bloke with a good thing _ he horned in. In 1906, the Rolls-Royce
company was launched (notice whose name went on the sign first).
</P>
<P>
   In 1910, Rolls achieved the dubious distinction of becoming the
first Englishman to be killed in an airplane crash.
</P>
<P>
   By 1914, the company was well established and began building
aircraft engines, which also proved successful. During World War I,
Lawrence of Arabia originated desert tank warfare with a fleet of
nine armored Rolls-Royce cars, thus establishing a long tradition
of Rolls-Royce sales in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   In 1931, Rolls-Royce acquired Bentley and two years later Royce
died. In World War II, Rolls built the famed Merlin engine that
powered the Supermarine Spitfire, Hawker Hurricane, and the North
American P-51. Postwar, Rolls became a power in aviation. And went
broke doing it.
</P>
<P>
   In 1971, in dire financial straits, the motor car and diesel
divisions survived as a public company, Rolls-Royce Motors; in
1980, that company merged with what is now Vickers PLC. In 1998,
the car company, once again in dire financial straits, was put on
the block by Vickers.
</P>
<P>
   BMW, the company that built the Luftwaffe engines that the
Spitfires were shooting at in the air war, was apparently the
successful bidder. A deal was announced. Volkswagen, builder of
Hitler's ``people's car'' and wings for Messerschmitt fighters,
slipped a higher bid under the back door, so to speak, and it was
announced that ``in the interest of Vickers stockholders'' _ more
dough _ Volkswagen would get the company.
</P>
<P>
   Here's where the story really gets weirdly complicated. Rolls
had decided that its engines could no longer pass muster in the
face of increasingly stringent pollution requirements, couldn't
afford to develop a new motor, and so had contracted for BMW
engines. When VW got Rolls, BMW said it would cancel the engine
contract. Suddenly, VW had a factory to produce engineless cars.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, the deal had never included the Rolls-Royce trademark _
Rolls-Royce Motor Co. leased its name from the mother corporation,
a holdover from previous restructuring. So, BMW bid $66 million and
bought the label _ it would build a new facility in Britain to put
a car under it. It was looking like the deal from hell. Orders for
Rolls-Royce cars plummeted.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, a good fairy has come to the rescue, disguised as a
golf bag _ the whole mess was reportedly ironed out on a golf
course. As the deal now stands, BMW gives its blessing to VW to use
the trademark and build the cars at Crewe until Dec. 31, 2002,
presumably when its new factory will be ready. BMW will continue to
build engines for the VW Royce. In 2003, BMW begins building
Rolls-Royce models in a new facility in England, and VW is limited
to Bentleys. According to Automotive News, VW at that time will
begin supplying Royce car bodies to the new BMW company.
</P>
<P>
   What's really weird is that these two archrivals will enter into
a joint marketing arrangement selling both cars through the
existing dealer networks. If you thought Chrysler-Daimler was
strange, this is really cuckoo.
</P>
<P>
   I guess the next question is: Will the Germans learn to like tea
and warm beer? And will they all live happily ever after?
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   A recent column on driver ed prompted some mail and news of a
new driver ed opportunity. Sandy Stevens, driving trainer for
police academies and operator of an advanced driving school for
many years, has teamed up with an insurance company, Vermont Fire,
to offer real training to the novice driver.
</P>
<P>
   The program stems from the insurance company's unusual approach
to insuring young drivers: Don't gouge them for stiff premiums
until after an accident but offer them training to avoid mishaps.
Cost of the training session is $100, thanks to subsidies from the
insurance firm; similar courses go for $400-$500.
</P>
<P>
   For information, write to Sandy Stevens, PO Box 1122, Merrimack,
NH 03054.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, Stevens offers a videotape study course in driving
technique for $39.95 plus $4 shipping _ same address. No, you can't
learn to drive watching a tape, but it will sort out the good
information from the myths and start you thinking correctly.

 &HT;    WHAT'S BEHIND STARR'S MULTI-MILLION DOLLAR EXPENSE
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Critics of independent counsel Kenneth Starr have
made the $40-50 million spent on the probe of President Clinton
into a rallying cry.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's defenders turn the tables, asserting that White House
delay tactics, stonewalling, and costly court appeals have dragged
out the four-year probe and driven up the price tag.
</P>
<P>
   And that is just part of the money battle that has been a
backdrop in this titanic legal struggle.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans in Congress have protested that dozens of government
lawyers at the White House and in federal departments are helping
to defend the president on the taxpayers' tab.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton defenders, for their part, complain about the huge
private legal fees that the first family and their associates have
to pay in the probe that stems from the Clinton's Whitewater real
estate venture in Arkansas. As many as 100 current and former White
House officials, and up to 300 others connected with the Clintons
in Arkansas and elsewhere, have run up private legal bills in
excess of $23 million, according to a recent survey conducted by
the liberal Nation magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Although much more than money is at stake, the high cost has
touched a responsive chord in the public and has become a major
refrain among the president's defenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American public is sick of this $50-million five-year sex
investigation,'' James Carville, a close Clinton friend and
self-declared commander of a ``war'' on Starr, said in a call to
cable TV's ``Rivera Live'' this past week.
</P>
<P>
   That charge ``is a great sound bite,'' said C. Boyden Gray, who
served as President George Bush's chief counsel. But Gray added in
a telephone interview that most of the money was spent long before
the investigation into allegations that Clinton had sex with former
White House intern Monica Lewinsky and then attempted a cover-up.
</P>
<P>
   He suggested that the Lewinsky investigation, which is only
seven months old, has probably cost no more than $10 million, while
the bulk of the expenses have come in earlier phases of Starr's
investigation into the Whitewater land deal, the improper storage
of FBI files in the White House, the firing of the White House
travel office staff and the death of White House deputy counsel
Vincent Foster.
</P>
<P>
   Gray also said that the White House has pushed the government's
costs much higher by fighting Starr in appeals courts on
attorney-client privilege, testimony from president's Secret
Service agents assigned to protect the president, and executive
privilege claims.
</P>
<P>
   In one ultimately unsuccessful appeal of attorney-client
privilege, the Justice Department saw a conflict-of-interest in
opposing Starr, and so the Clinton administration hired the law
firm of Mayer, Brown and Platt to argue the White House case in the
Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals in St. Louis. The firm charged a
discounted rate of $99 an hour compared with its normal top rate of
$500 an hour. Nevertheless, the bill came to about $100,000, said
firm member Andrew Frey.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the White House counsel's office has more than
doubled in size since Clinton took office and now totals at least
34 people, several of whom work daily on the Clinton defense
strategy. Justice Department attorneys and lawyers at the Treasury
Department have been brought into various aspects of the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The total price tag may never be known. However, the expense has
some defenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a system that needs, even at a very high cost, to
guarantee that the person in charge with enforcing the federal laws
is not himself a lawbreaker, `` George Washington University law
professor Jonathan Turley said on CNN this week. ``I mean, this is
an expensive system. Madisonian democracy is not a deal. There are
cheaper alternatives. It's just that they're not better systems.''

   He was always something of a swashbuckler by his own account, a
teen-age refugee from Hitler's Germany who fought for America in
the Pacific, then surreptitiously shipped out to Israel for its
1948 war of independence. Afterward, he picked up a PhD in
economics from the University of California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   But the great adventure of Ralph Anspach's life began in 1971.
That was when an after-dinner game of Monopoly and an argument
about oil prices turned him into an inventor determined to build a
better game.
</P>
<P>
   That put him on a collision with Parker Brothers, the Salem game
publishing firm that during the 1930s had turned Monopoly into the
best-selling board game ever. And the subsequent clash between the
populist professor and the determined corporation flickered in and
out of the headlines for a quarter of a century before it was
resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Now Anspach, a professor of economics at San Francisco State
University, has produced a book-length account of his adventure.
And though it may not be the last word, it is by far the fullest
version yet of a battle that illuminates key elements of American
business history, from the populism of the 1880s to the great
galvanization of the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly everybody knows the story of Monopoly _ how it was
invented by an out-of-work heating engineer named Charles Darrow
during the dark days of the Great Depression. Darrow set the game
in Atlantic City to remind his children of happier days at the
beach resort in the days before the 1929 Crash. The story was
contained in every box.
</P>
<P>
   At least that's where matters stood when Anspach put his game of
Anti-Monopoly on the national market in 1974. Then Parker Brothers
sued, charging patent infringement, determined to put the professor
out of business. But pretty soon it turned out that the Darrow
legend concealed a far more fascinating, if less inspiring, truth.
</P>
<P>
   When sued, Anspach did what inventors usually do. He prepared to
defend his originality and countersued as well, asserting that
Parker Brothers didn't really have a perfect right to patent
protection. As the confrontation began to make the airwaves _ it
was a cute story, after all _ people began telling Anspach of how
they had played the game of Monopoly in the early years of the
century, long before Darrow claimed to have ``invented'' it.
</P>
<P>
   Then began a strange cross-country journey in the course of
which Anspach visited old-timers, interviewed them, and slowly
traced Monopoly back to its beginnings. Often he was accompanied by
Parker Brothers patent attorney, an amiable New Yorker named Oliver
Howes.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out that the basic version of the game we know today _
purchasable properties including utilities, a ``Go to jail'' space,
and a public park where ``free parking'' is today _ had been
invented in 1904 by a woman named Elizabeth Magie who was
interested in illustrating Henry George's single tax principles.
She called it the Landlord's Game.
</P>
<P>
   Magie's game had passed through many hands, being played in
universities and utopian communities, gradually coming to be known
as monopoly, until it took its distinctive present form _ Atlantic
City street names, including the misspelled Marvin Gardens _ in a
group of Quakers with roots in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   It was from a high school friend among the Quakers that Darrow
learned the game. Anspach actually found the couple who taught him
the rules. And the professor reconstructed in loving detail the
subsequent fraud that Darrow and his Parker Brothers sponsers
perpetrated: buying up rival patents (especially a game called
Finance,) intimidating would-be imitators, rewriting history, all
in the interest of developing what would become one of the
entertainment industry's most successful brands.
</P>
<P>
   All this is laid out in Anspach's 224-page book, ``The Billion
Dollar Monopoly Swindle.'' It is self-published, costs $18, can be
easily obtained at 650-299-0534 or www.antimonopoly.com, and is
engagingly written in detective story fashion. It really belongs in
every summer cottage that now contains a game of Monopoly (or
Anti-Monopoly) and a reader or two.
</P>
<P>
   This is Anspach's story, not Monopoly's: his early start-up
difficulties, the search for evidence, the court battles (in one
momentary reversal, his Antimonopoly games are plowed into a
Minnesota garbage dump), his continual public relations battle with
the giant corporations that own the game (at one point, Anspach
crashes the World Monopoly Tournament; at another, he ceremonially
contributes a plaque to the Atlantic City Holiday Inn that stands
on the site where the game was actually invented).
</P>
<P>
   Less clear in this account, but still stimulating, is Anspach's
analysis of patent, copyright, and trademark law. What he doesn't
fathom is the high fixed cost that was necessary to make a national
game of Monopoly, and Parker Brothers' corresponding drive to
recover its investment and make a gain. After all, what
businessperson will be willing to expensively develop a product he
cannot control? There is a world of difference between a tenured
professor off on a quest and a commercial firm desperately
struggling for solvency.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, the climax of Anspach's book comes when Robert R.M.
Barton, the business genius who saw Parker Brothers through the
Great Depression, describes his patent strategy: ``We had the basic
underlying patent of the Landlord's Game...we owned the Finance
game, and we owned Charles Darrow's game...We had the whole
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Anspach's rejoinder, that only inventors are entitled to
patents, is much too flip. For Barton has assembled a monopoly on
the rights to Monopoly _ and he (and his front Charles Darrow) have
gained a great fortune, just as in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of the book, when Anspach finally has won the
right to market his Antimonopoly game, a vice president of Hasbro
Inc., Parker Brothers' most recent corporate parent, says to him,
``Welcome to the world of competition, Ralph.'' What does he find?
That Pawtucket, R.I.-based Hasbro has bought up 80 percent to the
game market, that Toys R Us controls a similar portion of the
retail market, that shelf space is all, and that computers are
quickly turning board games into a novelty items. In this rough and
tumble world not even patents can make the world safe for
cardboard.
</P>
<P>
   You can't ask one guy to do everything. Anspach has blazed a
trail, amassed a great lot of evidence, written a great cautionary
tale against the trust we too often repose in public relations
hype. But his economics are disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   It will remain for others to draw the moral, to make the most
basic point _ that we tolerate, even sanction monopolies, because
they deliver the goods. They are a vital feature of the landscape,
as desirable as they are inevitable. So in the meantime, Parker
Brothers' Monopoly still has much economics to teach.

   CLINTON-ISOLATION (Washington) _ Faced with the most portentous
day of his turbulent career _ detailed questioning under oath on

OAKLAND DESIGNATES POT DISTRIBUTORS AS CITY `OFFICERS' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SELMA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ Oakland on Thursday became the first city in
the country to designate employees of a marijuana club as municipal
``officers'' with authority to distribute pot for medicinal uses.
</P>
<P>
   But the latest city effort is on a certain crash course with
federal and state efforts to quash California's Proposition 215,
the 1996 ballot initiative that under certain conditions legalized
distribution of marijuana as a medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt like we needed to be out on the frontier to make sure
that Proposition 215 can be implemented,'' City Council member Nate
Miley said Thursday at a brief City Hall ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   City officials and a team of attorneys announced that a new city
ordinance will permit volunteers and employees at the Oakland
Cannabis Buyers' Cooperative to distribute marijuana for medicinal
purposes without threat of arrest.
</P>
<P>
   City officials are trying to take advantage of a section of the
Federal Controlled Substance Act that was originally intended to
protect police officers who use or transport illegal drugs as part
of undercover work. The provision says that any officer of a city
who is enforcing drug laws has immunity from prosecution under
those laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``Designating these officers will blow a hole through the
controlled substances act,'' said Robert Raich, the attorney who
led the effort to create the ordinance. ``An agent of the city has
the duty to enforce the ordinance and is immune under the federal
law.''
</P>
<P>
   At the U.S. attorney's office, news of the ordinance drew a
cautious response Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I'm going to say is that we are aware of Oakland's
decision and looking at it very carefully,'' spokesman Gregory King
said.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Ross, spokesman for Attorney General Dan Lungren, said the
operators of the Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Cooperative will still be
violating state law and a court decision that cannabis clubs cannot
operate.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the passage of Proposition 215 by 56 percent of
California's voters, Lungren, federal prosecutors and the courts
have refused to consider the clubs as medical caregivers.
</P>
<P>
   The law allows a patient or ``primary care-giver'' to possess
and use marijuana if it is recommended by a physician for the
treatment of an illness.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, cooperatives in San Francisco, San Jose and
elsewhere have been forced to shut down on the basis that the clubs
violated federal law prohibiting the distribution of controlled
substances.
</P>
<P>
   In May, the federal government won a preliminary injunction
against the Oakland Cooperative, but it has continued to operate.
</P>
<P>
   On July 9, Oakland passed the most permissive medical marijuana
guidelines in the state, permitting medical marijuana users to
maintain a cache of 1 1/2 pounds _ or 10 cigarettes per day _
without fear of arrest.
</P>
<P>
   The city broke new ground again on July 28 when the council
unanimously passed an ordinance designating marijuana retailers
``officers of the city.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday was the official launching of the ordinance.

SCIENTISTS DISCOVER THRIVING CORAL REEFS NEAR TINY CARIBBEAN ISLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By NICOLE TSONG  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The discovery of pristine coral reefs near a
virtually unknown American island in the Caribbean is a chance for
the United States to repair a ``melancholy history'' of coral reef
preservation, Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   A two-week scientific expedition to the remote island revealed
coral reefs that researchers said may be the most pristine reefs in
Caribbean and U.S. waters, according to scientists from the Center
for Marine Preservation (CMC), a nonprofit marine preservation
group.
</P>
<P>
   The island, called Navassa, supports hundreds of species of
animals and plants in a dry, hot climate. The tiny, rocky two
square miles of U.S. territory, 40 miles east of Haiti, lacks fresh
water. A surrounding cliff forces visitors to either climb a ladder
from the shore or fly in on helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   CMC scientists have been interested in exploring the island for
some time, according to Roger McManus, president of the group. When
CMC asked the Interior Department to sponsor the expedition,
Babbitt said his first response was: ``I never heard of Navassa
before.''
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt said the proposed expedition was ``fraught with mystery
and romance possibilities.'' He endorsed the proposal on the basis
of the scientific knowledge that would be gained, Babbitt said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no escaping the fact that we must prevent the
melancholy history of degradation and misuse'' of coral reefs, he
told reporters here. Coral reefs have been mismanaged, exploited
and overused by the United States, he said, citing reef destruction
by boaters or water pollution.
</P>
<P>
   When areas such as the Florida Keys were opened to boaters in
the 1930s, there wasn't much emphasis placed on preserving the
delicate coral growths that house hundreds of marine organisms.
</P>
<P>
   The Interior Department is considering making the island a
refuge or special management zone, which would limit human access
to the territory. The department already requires visitors to
obtain special permission to go there.
</P>
<P>
   ``The natural values of this place _ small, fragile, uninhabited
_ certainly speak of protecting it,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael Smith, a CMC scientist on the trip, said the remote
location and difficult access have made it difficult for humans to
extensively exploit the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Navassa is not in anyone's backyard,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Navassa has not always been deserted. In the mid 1800s, a
Baltimore-based mining company sent 140 workers there to mine
guano. But in 1889, a rebellion killed five supervisors, and many
workers were returned to Baltimore to face murder charges.
</P>
<P>
   The company continued operations until 1898 when the
Spanish-American war forced the company to evacuate the workers.
The firm later filed for bankruptcy. The island has not been mined
since.
</P>
<P>
   Holes made by the miners make it difficult to walk on the
island. ``It takes four hours to walk a mile,'' hopping over holes,
Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   The scientific expedition discovered 15 species of previously
unknown plants, insects, lichens and reptiles unique to the island,
Smith said. Scientists may find up to 250 new species once the
samples are examined, he added.
</P>
<P>
   In waters around the coral reef, the marine team also found
healthy populations of organisms that are declining in other parts
of the Caribbean, such as black spiny sea urchins, which nearly
died off in the 1980s, according to Nina Young, the CMC's marine
team leader. She said nearby deep waters haven't been explored.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've only begun to scratch the surface,'' Young said.
</P>
<P>
   Limiting access to the area will be necessary to preserve the
marine environment, which the CMC scientists tout as the best
example of primitive Caribbean waters, she added.
</P>
<P>
   Lured by the natural riches of the island, people ``could come
in and destroy the fabulous nature of this reef,'' Young said.
</P>
<P>
   The harsh climate and lack of water have prevented people from
settling the island and, as a result, the coral reef has had
limited human contact, she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said diving into the waters off the coast of the tiny island
was like ``looking into the window of an aquarium.''
</P>
<P>
   The island has been a U.S. territory since a sea captain named
Peter Duncan claimed it in 1857.

FOUNDER OF LUBY'S CAFETERIA CHAIN DEAD AT 88 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CARMINA DANINI  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Robert M. ``Bob'' Luby, founder of a cafeteria
that opened in San Antonio in 1947 and eventually evolved into a
multimillion-dollar chain serving homestyle food, has died at age
88.
</P>
<P>
   Luby died of heart complications Thursday in a Colorado Springs,
Colo., hospital, according to Luby's spokeswoman Karen Sparks.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the company founded by Luby and his cousin, Charles R.
Johnston, has 231 units in 11 states. Texas has 160 Luby's
Cafeterias.
</P>
<P>
   Born July 14, 1910, in Mansfield, Mo., Bob Luby and his parents
moved to San Antonio in 1927. Although he'd owned a successful
cafeteria in Dallas before the war, Bob Luby decided to open his
first post-war venture in San Antonio after returning from military
service.
</P>
<P>
   Opening a cafeteria at a downtown location was viewed as Luby's
folly. But it turned out to be the perfect spot. Opening day _ Jan.
28, 1947 _ found Luby's Cafeteria packed with customers at lunch
and at dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Success was due to three things: throngs of servicemen home from
the war, downtown hotels filled with families because of the
housing shortage and theaters that drew people to see a movie and
eat dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Luby and Johnston ran the company based partly on the philosophy
of ``share the work, share the risks, share the profits,''
principles attributed to Luby's father, Harry.
</P>
<P>
   To this day, 40 percent of a cafeteria's net income goes to the
managers and the owners get the rest.
</P>
<P>
   In the early years, according to ``The Luby's Story,'' written
by Steve Barnhill and published in 1988, Luby and Johnston had
their office in the front seat of their Studebaker.
</P>
<P>
   The accounting system wasn't sophisticated, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``We paid for everything in cash _ deliveries, bills _ right out
of the cash register. The outgo was recorded in a little book kept
beside the register,'' Luby said.
</P>
<P>
   Luby served as president until 1971, chairman of the board until
1982 and as director and consultant until 1993, when he was named
director emeritus. That same year, Luby was inducted into the Texas
Business Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   It was Luby's father, Harry Luby, a clothes merchant, who first
embraced a concept that was quite new in 1911 of customers
selecting their food from a counter and carrying it on trays to
their table.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Luby opened his first cafeteria, the New England Dairy
Lunch, in Springfield, Mo., in 1911. By 1927, he owned 11
cafeterias in three states. The venture proved so lucrative that he
retired at age 39.
</P>
<P>
   As a teen-ager, Bob Luby worked in his father's cafeterias,
learning the business from the ground up. He also took to heart his
father's credos: Give people fresh, quality food at reasonable
prices and feed the hungry.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Luby is survived by his wife, Kathleen Lane Luby; two
daughters, Dr. Martha Luby Lahana of Colorado, and Elizabeth Rogers
and husband Wallace Rogers III of San Antonio; and two
grandchildren, Emmy Rogers and Wallace Rogers IV.

   ISLAM-WEDDING_ NABLUS, West Bank _ Standing before a soccer
stadium packed with about 15,000 people, 35 men stand in black
suits holding red Korans and the green Islamic flag. They are young
Palestinian grooms, expressing what for many is a new attachment to
Islam in a public wedding celebration that glorifies the religion
and, indirectly, Hamas. One Hamas spokesman calls the young
believers the ``raw material'' for his movement. For the second
year, Islamic groups in this large West Bank city are reviving
their faith with a strong dose of politics and by helping young
couples navigate the complexities of Islamic courtship. These

   PROBE-COSTS _ WASHINGTON _ Critics of independent counsel
Kenneth Starr say he has spent in excess of $40 million
investigating President Clinton. Starr's defenders say one of the
chief reasons for the expense is White House stall tactics,
including several costly court appeals. Regardless, Starr's
expenses are only part of the real cost, since dozens of government
lawyers have been pulled into the case on the White House side. And

   CLINTON-REPORTERS _ WASHINGTON _ They slogged through Whitewater
despite a public that often preferred to hear less rather than more
about presidential scandal. They weathered the backlash of the
Clinton White House and sometimes faced resistance from fellow
reporters and their own publications. Now the handful of
journalists who have followed a trail of Clinton controversies for
six years are seeing their work lead to the first-ever appearance
by a president before a criminal grand jury. The persistence of
fewer than a dozen reporters has been largely responsible for
keeping the issue of Clinton's conduct before the country. ``The
heroes are the ones that have kept it alive,'' says Britt Hume, who
anchors an evening report on Washington for Fox Cable News. ``These
people have done tremendously well on this story, and it hasn't
been easy.'' Among them: Susan Schmidt of The Washington Post,
Newsweek's Mike Isikoff, Steve Labaton of The New York Times, Pete
Yost of the AP, as well as Jackie Judd and Chris Vlasto of ABC.

   US-ADULTERY _ WASHINGTON - Despite President Clinton's high
approval ratings in the face of allegations of marital infidelity,
a huge majority of Americans still believe adultery is wrong,
according to polling data. And adultery among the average American
couple is far less common than the flurry of recent allegations
against Clinton and other public figures would suggest, say
sociologists, marriage counselors and clergy. But in cases of
divorce, adultery plays a much larger role. (Shepard, Cox News
Service).

   UNDATED - Praise your children in public. Criticize them in
private.
</P>
<P>
   Don't lecture.
</P>
<P>
   Express joy that your child is your child. Keep your marriage
strong.
</P>
<P>
   Talk to your teenagers about saving sex for marriage, then give
them reasons to say no.
</P>
<P>
   Apologize. Spank your child in specific circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   And pray. Pray a lot.
</P>
<P>
   Focus on the Family's ``Complete Book of Baby &AMP; Child Care''
takes parents from preparing the nest to emptying the nest in its
887 pages and over territory not traveled by the world's
best-selling parenting resource, ``Dr. Spock's Baby and Child
Care.``
</P>
<P>
   The seventh revised edition of Benjamin Spock's book, released
in June, is light on religion, with only a brief mention of
spirituality and God.
</P>
<P>
   Focus' book integrates spirituality as an everyday part of life
for families, gives advice on instilling moral and religious
beliefs in children, and acts as a practical reference book for
parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea was to have a book that would cross over into the
broader public . . . yet to get across the idea that it's as
reasonable for a family to pray over something as it is for them to
check it out on the Internet,'' said Dr. Paul C. Reisser, the
book's primary author and a family practitioner in Thousand Oaks,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The authors succeeded in writing a book with up-to-date medical
advice on caring for children that will appeal beyond the
conservative Christian circles that are Focus on the Family's
biggest supporters, said Elisa Morgan, the founder and president of
Mothers of Preschoolers. The Christian support group for mothers is
found in many denominations, and she is recommending the book to
the organization's 70,000 mothers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It covers the gamut,'' Morgan said. ``I felt it was fair and
balanced and written very comfortably on the lay level. It's just
practical wisdom and advice. We get this precious baby in our
hands, and we think `Yikes! What am I supposed to do now?' If
you've got a problem, you can look it up.''
</P>
<P>
   The 13,000-member Christian Medical &AMP; Dental Society also is
recommending the book to its members and their patients. There are
good comprehensive child-care books on the market and good books on
spirituality and children, but this is the first book to combine
the two so well, said Dr. David Stevens, the executive director of
the Tennessee-based national professional organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``The book has filled a void that has existed for many years,''
said Stevens, a physician with a specialty in family practice.
``There's a great hunger out there among parents for somebody who
can speak authoritatively on key issues as well as integrate that
with a clear (religious) world view.''
</P>
<P>
   The foreword was written by James Dobson, founder and president
of Focus on the Family, an evangelical Christian ministry with
radio programs, books, magazines and other ministries based in
Colorado Springs. The book itself is the work of 40 Christian
physicians, members of the Focus on the Family Physicians Resource
Council. An additional 50 physicians, covering numerous
specialties, reviewed and edited the material.
</P>
<P>
   The physicians are a volunteer group that advises the Christian
ministry on medical issues, and they worked on the book at the
request of Tyndale House Publishers Inc., which wanted a
comprehensive book on nurturing a child's mind, body and soul for
the both the churchgoing and non-churchgoing crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The book's values are Judeo-Christian, but the tone is Christian
with quotes from both the Old and New testaments. In the foreword,
Dobson's first advice on parenting is ``dedicating yourself and
your baby to the care of the only truly perfect parent _ the Lord
Jesus Christ,'' but the book is not a crusade for the soul. Rather,
it's written for single mothers, unwed teen mothers, divorced
parents, stepfamilies, grandparents raising grandchildren and
traditional families.
</P>
<P>
   The book does not gloss over heavy subjects such as suicide,
drugs and alcohol, sexual activity, homosexuality, death,
pornography, teenage pregnancy, eating disorders and divorce. They
are discussed from a biblical viewpoint.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Spock advises parents to tell their teenagers to
wait until ``love is deep and long-lasting before having sexual
relations.'' Focus' book says it is ``appropriate, wise and
potentially life-saving'' to teach your children to save sex for
marriage and spends several pages on why the book advocates this.
</P>
<P>
   In discussing the topic of teenage pregnancy, a parent's
reaction to other families' situations is important: ``If you give
a clear signal that the non-marital sex was wrong but respond with
compassion (and prayer) for the people involved, you make it clear
you can be approached if anyone at home has a problem. But if your
response sounds something like `Don't you ever do something as
stupid/shameful/evil as this,' you could block potentially critical
communication in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The majority of child-care books advise against spanking a
child, as does the American Academy of Pediatrics, an organization
of 53,000 doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Parents do spank their children, Reisser said, and the Focus
book gives guidelines so spanking is not a release of a parent's
anger.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a problem of many parents who use it too much, too
often, too harshly,'' Reisser said.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-page chapter on discipline spends a page and a half on
spanking, and discusses at length how corporal punishment should
not be administered: not out of anger or frustration, not
frequently, not to bruise or break the skin, not with a paddle,
belt or hairbrush, not after a child is 10, not if the parent was
abused as a child.
</P>
<P>
   ``A disciplinary spanking should be administered only in
response to an episode of willful defiance characterized by a
clear, appropriate parental directive that the child understands
and is capable of following; a direct challenge from a child,
especially with a disrespectful or hostile tone; or persistent and
blatant refusal to cooperate,'' the book reads.
</P>
<P>
   A spank should be one to three quick swats on the buttocks,
enough to catch the child's attention and break through the
defiance, the book reads.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are moments of intense conflict that can develop,
usually among young children, who are simply in a flat-out
go-ahead-make-my-day defiant mode and talk isn't working and time
out isn't working,'' Reisser said. ``Reasonable conversation has
come to a conclusion, and the child is just begging to see who is
going to win this conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyndale House is calling the book the most current and complete
guide to child care from birth to teens.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes them through that initial stage of coming to decision
points, and often times it gives them the information they need to
handle the situation,'' Stevens said. ``I think it's going to be a
resource that is going to be utilized for generations. It will be
the first gift I give my son and my daughter when they have their
first children.''
</P>
<P>
   The Physicians Resource Council began working on the book in
1994, and Tyndale House Publishers released it in October. The
hardcover book sells for $29.95.  &QL;

   &QL;  PENNA. LEADS NATION IN CONCEALED GUNS
</P>
<P>
   By Paul Kane
</P>
<P>
   States News Service
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Aug. 14 -- Pennsylvania has more residents walking
the streets with concealed handguns than any other state in the
nation, according to a study by the nation's leading gun control
advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   Pennsylvania's ``lock-and-load'' reputation is buttressed by a
system that allows just about anyone except hardened criminals and
the mentally ill to carry a concealed weapon, gun control advocates
say.
</P>
<P>
   There are currently 575,000 residents licensed to carry a
concealed gun in Pennsylvania, according to a report by Handgun
Control, Inc., an advocacy group headed by Sarah Brady, the wife of
former White House Press Secretary James Brady.
</P>
<P>
   Only New York, with 530,000 licenses for concealed weapons,
comes close to Pennsylvania. The third highest number of licenses
came from the state of Washington, with less than 250,000.
</P>
<P>
   Not even Texas, a state with almost twice as many people and an
historic image of gun-toting cowboys, can compare to Pennsylvania.
It has just 161,433 concealed weapons permits, more than 3.5 times
fewer than in the Keystone state.
</P>
<P>
   And Handgun Control's estimates may be a bit conservative.
Pennsylvania State Police say the number of residents licensed to
carry a concealed handgun is probably closer to 600,000 -- about 8
percent of the state's adult population.
</P>
<P>
   Cambria County Sheriff Bob Kolar said most of his applications
are submitted, and approved, by mail. In 1997, he issued 14,863
permits for Cambria residents to carry concealed handguns,
including 1,977 to women.
</P>
<P>
   Dauphin County, by contrast, with almost 100,000 more residents
than Cambria, gave out 6,000 permits for concealed weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Residents can obtain a five-year permit to carry a handgun by
filling out a one-page application at their county sheriff's
office. The only way people can be denied a permit is if they have
been convicted of a felony or on drug charges, or if they have a
known alcohol problem or have been institutionalized.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no other hoops you have to go through,'' said Joe
Sudbay, spokesman for Handgun Control.
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, concealed handgun permits are virtually
nonexistent, as that state only allows residents whose careers
require them to carry weapons. New Jersey has permitted just 4,300
residents to carry concealed handguns, with 95 percent of those
going to retired policemen or armored car guards.
</P>
<P>
   Sudbay said Pennsylvania should require some safety training for
people that carry weapons, as is done in Texas, where residents
must undergo between 10 and 15 hours of safety training before they
will be granted a license to carry a concealed handgun. That would
deter some people from getting the license, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Gov. Tom Ridge believes that the new instant background
check, which began July 1, ensures that felons and drug dealers do
not get handgun permits. And Handgun Control does credit Ridge with
adopting a strong background check, going even further than federal
guidelines in denying some gun licenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pretty much a national leader,'' said Jerry Feazer,
Ridge's spokesman. ``If you should not have a gun in your hands,
you will not purchase one, at least not legally, in Pennsylvania.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kolar, the Cambria sheriff, said the issue isn't always
about keeping guns from criminals, especially in rural areas like
his where hunting and target practice are deep-rooted traditions.
He noted that there are an increasing number of women taking up
hunting, as well as men and children from families that haven't
been around guns their entire lives.
</P>
<P>
   Those with hunting licenses, which required safety training,
shouldn't have to go through safety classes, Kolar said. But the
others should, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some type of schooling should be available,'' he said. ``There
should be some type of guidelines.''
</P>

   DELTA-PLANES _ In a move to reverse the gradual aging of its
fleet, Delta will accelerate the retirement of its 131 Boeing 727
jets. The last of the three-engine, three-pilot workhorses will
leave by 2005, three years ahead of the previous schedule. They
will be replaced primarily by the 737-800, which is more efficient
and requires only two pilots. (Thurston, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   AIRFARES _ American Airlines is raising advance purchase fares 4
percent and Delta expected to follow suit. The move follows a
similar attempt last week that collapsed when Northwest didn't go
along. This time the increase exempts routes of direct competition
with Northwest. (Thurston, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   GAPACIFIC-DEBT _ Georgia-Pacific Corp.'s debt levels are forcing
it to stop its share buyback program, which totalled $150 million
of stock in the first six months. The company also said it expects
to spend $60 million late this year and early next year trying to
fix its Year 2000 problems _ only $7 million of which has already
been spent. (Mitchell, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   CITRUS _ The first citrus forecast is released today. (Waresh,
Palm Beach Post).
</P>
<P>
   VOTE _ Final vote by Teamsters at Tropicana's plants in Fort
Pierce, Fla., and Bradenton, Fla. (Bhatt, Palm Beach Post). 12.
</P>
<P>
   IMAC _ With 150,000 advance orders and predictions that as many
and 400,000 will be sold by year-end, Apple Computer's iMac arrives
at stores Saturday amid great expecations. Computize, an Austin
Apple seller, wasn't sure late this week how many iMac's it would
get from Apple for the launch. So the business asked customers who
had ordered several iMacs to settle for a partial order for a few
days and let the store sell some to walk-in customers. Anticipation
of the one-piece computer and monitor, which has been billed as an
evolutionary step ahead of standard personal computers, has helped
push Apple's stock to its highest levels in years. (Mahoney, Austin
American-Statesman). WITH PHOTO.

feel, how does it respond? Does it work as a concept? As a

   TEST-DRIVE _ ATLANTA _ The German/American automaker BMW reaches
a milestone this month when the 100,000th of its ``brand within a
brand'' M-Series vehicles comes off the assembly line at its Greer,
S.C., plant. (DeVault, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   SHARP-DRIVING _ ATLANTA _ When auto experts talk about
``alternative'' vehicles, they are usually referring to those
powered by natural gas or electricity. But you might also consider
a nontraditional vehicle as an alternative. (Sharp, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   THE-MECHANIC _ ATLANTA _ Adhering to the manufacturer's
specification for fuel octane is not a condition limited to the
owners of ``high performance'' vehicles. It is just as important
for the rest of us to heed the octane requirements of the cars we
drive. (Carter, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED.

   DELTA-PLANES _ In a move to reverse the gradual aging of its

EXCERPTS FROM `COMPLETE BOOK OF BABY &AMP; CHILD CARE` 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Excerpts from Focus on the Family's ``Complete Book of
Baby &AMP; Child Car''e:
</P>
<P>
   On a baby who cries a lot: ``Having a world-class wailer is a
humbling experience, and it is during these rough times that
special intimacy with God often develops. The question to ask him
isn't `Why did you give me such a fussy baby?!' but `What do you
want me to learn about myself and life in general through this
experience?' You may be surprised at the answer.''
</P>
<P>
   On nightmares: ``A few moments of prayer can also impart the
idea that Jesus is truly in charge and looking after your child
whether he's asleep or awake. Be sure, however, you are not
contributing to the problem by reciting `Now I Lay Me Down to
Sleep.' This poem's infamous lines `If I should die before I wake,
I pray the Lord my soul to take' are not only alarming and
inappropriate for children (and adults) but have no basis in
Scripture or anywhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   On death: ``Be honest when you don't have all the answers. . . .
The question `Why would God let this happen?' has for centuries
challenged young and old alike. . . . What parent and child need to
grasp is that God does indeed care very deeply for each of us, but
that we aren't always going to be allowed complete (or even
partial) understanding of every event that occurs during our
lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   On teenagers' problems: ``While you state your principles about
sex, drugs and other important matters with consistency, conviction
and clarity, your adolescent also must understand that he can come
to you when he has a problem. . . . If he knows you are a source of
strength and help when trouble comes, you will be able to help him
contain the damages if he makes an unwise decision. And indirectly,
you may show him the attributes of God, his ultimate refuge and
strength.'' &QL;

YELTSIN SAYS RUBLE   WON'T BE DEVALUED; STOCKS REBOUND 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   MOSCOW _ Seeking to stave off fears of a financial collapse,
President Boris Yeltsin Friday said Moscow would not devalue its
embattled currency, as Russian stocks rebounded after a week-long
free-fall that had left them at two-year lows.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin, who made several contradictory remarks, was firm on one
thing in his first public appearance in a month: His government
would continue to prop up the ruble, the stability of which is seen
as one of the few concrete economic achievements of six years of
painful reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be no devaluation,'' Yeltsin told reporters in the
medieval city of Novgorod, where he visited while taking a break
from a fishing vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's promise appeared to bolster investor confidence in
Russian markets. The Russian Trading System index _ the Russian
stock market's main indicator _ closed up 13.67 percent to finish
at 115.00, and trading even had to be halted briefly because prices
were rising too sharply.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to Friday, the index had plunged 24 percent this week,
culminating in Thursday's 6.5 percent drop, which prompted one
television station to call the day ``Black Thursday.'' Yields on
short-term treasury bills also dropped but still closed at 161
percent, up from 85.31 a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts agreed it was too early to dismiss fears that Russia
may be forced to default on debt payments or devalue the ruble _
moves the government, and Russia's Western allies, fear could have
serious social and political consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a month after the International Monetary Fund and
other world lenders handed Russia a whopping $22.6 billion bail-out
package, some observers are now saying that the West will have to
pony up as much as $15 billion more to keep the Kremlin afloat.
</P>
<P>
   In a 40-minute phone call with the Russian leader, President
Clinton, who is heading to Moscow for a summit next month, Friday
urged Yeltsin to act quickly and decisively on the economy, Reuters
news service reported.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's greatest fear is the possibility that a ruble
collapse could set off a chain reaction of hyperinflation and
social protest that could sweep away the Yeltsin government and
replace it with extremists, a sobering possibility in a country
with thousands of nuclear warheads.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has been reeling for months from the effects of the Asian
crisis and the low prices for oil and gas, the country's most
lucrative hard currency exports. Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko
has promised tough measures to raise tax revenue and cut spending,
but he has been unable to win support in the opposition-dominated
parliament. Confidence in his ability to halt Russia's downward
spiral is waning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The IMF package ended up being double what anyone thought, and
that should have been overkill,'' said Marshall Goldman, economics
professor at Wellesley College and associate director of Harvard
University's Davis Center for Russian Studies. ``Now, it may very
well be that we have to come up with another loan.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin, seeking to appear calm and in control, Friday gave a
vote of confidence to Kiriyenko, but gave the opposite impression
during impromptu remarks to reporters on other matters.
</P>
<P>
   First the president said there was no need to cut short his
vacation and return to Moscow. Then he abruptly announced that the
fishing was lousy and it was time to get back to work. Likewise,
Yeltsin at first dismissed the need to call an emergency session of
parliament. Then he signed a document asking the lower house, the
State Duma, to convene as soon as possible to debate Kiriyenko's
anti-crisis measures.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition groups that dominate the Duma said they would
agree to an emergency session as early as next week, but only if
the government explained what was going on in the economy first,
before the lower house reviews any laws.
</P>
<P>
   While the panic in Russian markets has yet to be felt among
ordinary citizens, most of whom keep what money they have outside
banks, there are ominous signs of crisis in the economy. Friday,
some foreign exchange booths shut down in central Moscow, blaming a
lack of hard currency, and some banks refused to allow depositors
to withdraw dollars from savings accounts. Many currency exchanges
remained open, but ruble dipped from 6.3 to the dollar Thursday to
between 6.75 to 7 to the dollar Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The central bank on Wednesday placed some restrictions on the
ability of commercial banks to buy hard currency, and the banking
system is already suffering liquidity problems and a crisis of
confidence. Firms that import consumer goods have begun to complain
that foreign lenders have stopped accepting letters of credit from
Russian banks.

PATRIOTS OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR KEEPS THE FAITH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SMITHFIELD, R.I. _ Paul Boudreau is respected by his offensive
linemen because he's direct and to the point. He told them in June
that if the Patriots had trouble running the ball, he would blame
them directly. He challanged them to adopt the attitude that paving
the way for the running game was their most important function.
</P>
<P>
   He was persuasive.
</P>
<P>
   Now Boudreau is trying to convince the naysayers that the new
approach is working. He urges skeptics to stop looking at the
dreadful exhibition statistics the running game has produced (2.8
yards per carry) through two games. He says that when and if the
Patriots decide who the main running back will be, there'll be a
big difference statistically.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, they're doing a pretty good job now ... we just don't
know who the runner is,'' said Boudreau. ``That's the big thing, in
my opinion. We've just got to know who the running back is. If it's
a committee _ Derrick Cullors, Sedrick Shaw, and the rook (Robert
Edwards) _ or if it's two guys ... whatever. We're trying to get
1,500 yards out of that spot. If we can, that's great. Last year we
had 1,160 yards out of Curtis (Martin) before he got hurt. He was
on pace for 1,500. He would have had a good year running the ball
had he not got hurt, and we wouldn't be having this discussion
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   When all is said and done, Edwards will be New England's
starting back. The staff is convinced of his ability. He will miss
Monday's game against the Cowboys in Mexico City because of a groin
problem, play a limited amount in Washington, then get turned loose
against Philadephia. At least that's the plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stats in preseason games don't matter,'' said Boudreau. ``If
you win, that's the bottom line. You can keep track of all those
stats and they don't mean a thing. I see improvement in my guys. I
see our tight ends knocking people down. I see our back-side guards
and tackle chopping people _ working hard on the back side. I'm
really pleased with what they're doing. We don't see any wins for
it. In the third and fourth quarter, the guys in there aren't going
to be the (regular) guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the San Francisco game, we were backed up five
times inside the 15-yard line and made a couple of first downs in
tough running situations and we punched it out. Sedrick fumbled the
ball. If you can change field position and keep Steve Young off the
field, then that helps your situation. Right now there's just no
stat to prove what I'm saying.''
</P>
<P>
   That's for sure. As convincing as Boudreau sounds that his line
will meet the challenge he's issued, the facts offer no such
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Last week on fourth and 1, Harold Shaw was stuffed for a 2-yard
loss. The Vikings got great penetration in the middle of the line.
If ever the attitude of knocking people back has to exist, it's in
those situations. This time it didn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not happy about where we are,'' said coach Pete Carroll.
``We have not made the progress with moving the football the way we
would like with all of the guys we have on offense. I think you
will see in the next couple of weeks that we have made some
progress with our running game.''
</P>
<P>
   Boudreau is not advocating that the offensive coaches hurry and
decide on the starting running back, but soon the linemen need to
know who will be the primary back so they can adjust to a style.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to see what Robert can do,'' said Boudreau. ``He's
got two preseason games to show something. We could do what KC did,
and they used three guys. Derrick has shown some spurts like he did
last year. Derrick was a fine running back for us last year. He's
188 pounds, and so the question is, can he run the ball 27 times a
game? Probably not. But if we have a committee and he has 10
carries and he's our third-down guy, then that's a significant
start. He's the kind of guy that when he gets into the open field,
he can make a guy miss. That's why he's good on special teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Boudreau said all the backs in camp suit the blocking style of
his line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our system is the way it is,'' he said. ``We had to block a
little bit different with Curtis because we had to hang a little
bit more on the back side. These guys are in our style, and all
three of them can run within our style.''
</P>
<P>
   Boudreau said veterans Max Lane and Todd Rucci have had good
camps, while Dave Wohlabaugh has been solid. Bruce Armstrong's
stress fracture hasn't been a factor because the veteran All-Pro
has ``been wearing that cast and he doesn't feel he has it on. He
feels soreness in the mornings but then he doesn't notice it.''
</P>
<P>
   Boudreau lauded Heath Irwin for the competition he has given
Rucci. He said the Class of '97 is also progressing. Ed Ellis, who
missed last week's game with strep throat, has been the most
impressive, while Scott Rehberg and Damon Denson (who recently
suffered an ankle injury) have stepped up their play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do they have to play right away? No,'' said Boudreau. ``If we
have anything happen up front, I'm not going to worry about it.''
</P>
<P>
   While being ordered to improve their run-blocking, the linemen
also have had to adapt to a new system which emphasizes the
three-step drop for the quarterback, as opposed to the five- and
seven-step drops of yesteryear. The blocking is much different,
according to Boudreau, because the guards and centers are
accustomed to dropping back more, and if they do that with a
three-step drop, they'll fall on Drew Bledsoe.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the average fan, who can't break down film and watch
blocking schemes, can't see much progress with the run-blocking. To
hear Boudreau tell it, there's nothing to worry about it.
</P>
<P>
   But the masses need to see a lot more before they're convinced.

PRESIDENT'S REPUTATION, LEGACY AT STAKE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (For Sunday release, Aug. 16) 
 
By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton places his legacy and reputation
_ and perhaps his job itself _ at stake Monday when he tells a
grand jury about his relationship with a former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors from independent counsel Kenneth Starr's office will
ask the president if he had sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky
and asked her to lie about it.
</P>
<P>
   The president has publicly denied a sexual relationship with the
25-year-old Californian. She reportedly has told the grand jury a
different story, though she maintains Clinton did not pressure her
to lie.
</P>
<P>
   For Clinton, it must be an agonizing moment as he faces
questions that are humiliating for him, embarrassing for his wife
and daughter, and damaging to his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Congress could decide to pursue impeachment charges to remove
him from office, a move that would plunge the nation into a
spectacle that could last for months.
</P>
<P>
   And, even if he keeps his job, the president's moral authority
as the nation's leader could be severely undermined, experts
contend.
</P>
<P>
   ``The end game here is survival,'' said Terry Madonna, a
pollster with Millersville University in Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall Wittmann, director of congressional relations at the
conservative Heritage Foundation, said, ``Clearly what's most at
stake is his credibility, and credibility is the coin of the realm
in politics.''
</P>
<P>
   The worst scenario for the president would be impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Within weeks, Starr is expected to send a report to Congress
about his findings in the case. Public hearings with direct
accusations on live television could come at some point the future.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans in Congress repeatedly have said there is little
inclination to pursue impeachment unless the president commits
perjury before the grand jury, which will watch the interrogation
by closed-circuit television. Still, members could give a full
airing of Starr's findings just as the campaign season gets under
way.
</P>
<P>
   Impeachment seems most unlikely because few GOP leaders want to
hand the presidency over to Vice President Al Gore, the Democrat to
beat in 2000, for two years.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Constitution, a president can be impeached for ``high
crimes and misdemeanors,'' but it does not define those terms. If
the House votes for articles of impeachment, the Senate conducts a
trial on whether to remove the president from office.
</P>
<P>
   Should Starr accuse Clinton of perjury before the grand jury,
the House could be forced to pursue a formal impeachment hearing.
However, if the issue remains whether Clinton lied in a civil
deposition about his sex life, many members speculate there will be
little inclination to seek impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   No president has ever been removed from office by the
impeachment process. President Nixon resigned in 1974 as the House
prepared articles of impeachment. President Andrew Johnson was
impeached by the House in 1868, but the Senate fell one vote shy of
the two-thirds total necessary to remove him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given what everybody knows now, I do not believe it is likely
that Congress would pursue impeachment,'' said Larry Gerston, a
political science professor at San Jose State University.
</P>
<P>
   Gerston cites Clinton's high standing with the public based on
the healthy economy, questions over the definition of an
impeachable offense and whether perjury would meet that definition;
the use and abuse of the independent counsel law.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the consequences remain serious even if Congress takes no
action.
</P>
<P>
   A damaged Democratic president would serve the political
purposes of Republicans now and when they try to reclaim the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is operating at half-speed. In a way,
Republicans have the president where they want him. He is largely
dysfunctional, particularly on domestic matters. They've got a
weakened president, which will allow them to do more than they
might have done otherwise while they keep him in office,'' Gerston
said.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, an overwhelming majority of the public believes
Clinton lied when he denied a relationship with Lewinsky. However,
polls indicate that an overwhelming majority also believe Clinton
should not be impeached. And his job approval rating exceeds 60
percent.
</P>
<P>
   But presidential power also resides in the moral authority of
the person holding the office, the ability to rally public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``His moral capital has been diminished and that is critical to
any president's leverage with both the public and Capitol Hill,''
Wittmann said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politically what's at stake is trying to save any capacity to
be effective over the next two years. So that stake is very high,''
said Robert Holsworth, a political science professor at Virginia
Commonwealth University.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he is hoping is the testimony and the next few months
will enable him to begin with a fresh start. He is the king of
fresh starts, but whether he'll really get that is an open
question,'' Holsworth said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Clinton dubbed himself ``the comeback kid'' in 1992 when
he first sought the presidency and was declared politically dead
numerous times. He fended off allegations throughout the 1992
campaign that he dodged the draft for the Vietnam War and had an
affair with Gennifer Flowers.
</P>
<P>
   His resilience repeatedly has defied conventional wisdom. Still,
the current crisis may be more than his reputation can take, even
if he beats Starr in the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to be impossible for him to be associated
with a dignified presidency,'' said Earl Black, a political science
professor at Rice University.
</P>
<P>
   But Gerston said it's too early to say how Clinton's legacy will
develop. It could be, he suggested, that ``the whole issue of
Monica Lewinsky will be looked upon with a wince'' while history
reflects more brightly on Clinton's other accomplishments. &QL;

RAYTHEON FACTORY WORKERS PROTEST JOB CUTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANDOVER, Mass. _ More than 500 &UR;  &LR; employees demonstrated outside a
Raytheon Co. defense manufacturing plant here Friday after learning
that 261 factory jobs would be cut from the payroll.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; About 100 of the cuts are expected to come from the Andover
plant, a union official said.
</P>
<P>
   The protest by members of Local 1505 of the International
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers came in the midst of bargaining
over a new labor agreement with Raytheon. The current &UR;  &LR; three-year
contract expires Aug. 29.
</P>
<P>
   Predawn demonstrations also were held at Raytheon plants in
Quincy and Waltham Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Raytheon announced a merger with Hughes, it was quoted as
saying there would be no layoff of manufacturing jobs,'' said David
Whalen, an assistant business manager for Local 1505 in Andover.
``But here we are one year later, and more than 200 jobs are going
to be eliminated. This is a slap in the face.''
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon spokeswoman Toni Simonetti said the decision to cut
factory jobs was ``strictly market related,'' and had nothing to do
with the company's $9.5 billion buyout last year of Hughes Aircraft
Co., the defense arm of Hughes Electronics Corp., a subsidiary of
General Motors Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reduction of 261 hourly jobs is due solely to a reduction
in the volume of work on certain defense programs such as the
Patriot Missile systems and the Hawk Missile systems,'' said
Simonetti.
</P>
<P>
   Simonetti declined to discuss contract negotiations. ``We do
have a (strike) contingency ... but we also feel that we are having
a productive dialogue with the union,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Whalen said talks began at the end of June and are expected to
continue through August. Key union issuesare job security and pay,
he said. ``In 1995, we agreed to some concessions, including a cut
in the pay &UR;  &LR; scale,'' said Whalen. ``But now we have people who were
making $15 (an hour), got laid off and then were recalled at $8.31
per hour. We now have a two-tier wage structure.''
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon, one of Massachusetts' biggest employers, has
facilities in 10 communities and 15,400 employees statewide.

100-BEST LIST ENCORE, WITH NEW RULES AND JUDGES 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By PAUL LEWIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Faced with widespread criticism of the list it
released last month of the 100 best English-language novels
published in this century _ most piercingly in written comments by
two of the judges who helped compile it _ the Modern Library says
it will significantly overhaul the way it picks its choice of the
century's hundred best English-language nonfiction books later this
year.
</P>
<P>
   In separate articles published this week, historian Arthur
Schlesinger Jr. and novelist William Styron, who were both members
of the 10-judge panel that drew up the list, distanced themselves
from the final outcome as well as from the methods by which the
books were chosen.
</P>
<P>
   Writing in the opinion pages of The Wall Street Journal,
Schlesinger said most panel members were ``astonished by at least
the last two of the top five choices.'' These were Vladimir
Nabokov's ``Lolita'' and Aldous Huxley's ``Brave New World,'' which
followed James Joyce's ``Ulysses,'' F. Scott Fitzgerald's ``Great
Gatsby'' and another of Joyce's works, ``Portrait of the Artist as
a Young Man.''
</P>
<P>
   He pointed out that while the panel had been asked to rate these
top five novels in order of merit because they had appeared on
nearly every judge's list, the members did not rank by number the
other books they nominated as being among the hundred best.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Modern Library editors ranked them according to the
number of times they appeared on individual judges' lists. When two
or more novels tied with the same number of votes, the editors,
rather than the judges, decided what order they should be placed
in, a fact first reported in The Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   Schlesinger also noted that Arthur Koestler's ``Darkness at
Noon,'' which occupied eighth place, had no business being on the
list at all since it was originally written in German.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he came down in favor of the Modern Library's
attempt to choose the 100 greatest novels in general terms, saying
``anything that provokes people to read novels and debate their
merits is a cultural victory.'' Writing in the current issue of The
New Yorker, Styron said he ``cheerfully'' assented to the view that
the Modern Library's final list was ``weird'' and that it displayed
a ``generally oppressive stodginess.''
</P>
<P>
   He also acknowledged that the panel of judges who made the
selection was ``entirely white, predominately male and somewhat
doddering.'' Schlesinger had calculated their average age at 69.
</P>
<P>
   Modern Library officials said they would change the process in
producing the planned list of the century's 100 best nonfiction
books so that the selection panel would be more diverse and the
voting system more rigorous.
</P>
<P>
   Like Schlesinger, Styron said that many books placed high on the
list owed their positions not to merit, but to the fact that eight
or nine judges thought they should appear ``somewhere among the
anointed hundred.''
</P>
<P>
   In his opinion, a luncheon meeting of the panel with ``good wine
that allowed for lively disputation'' would have produced a more
satisfactory result, eliminating such ``toothless pretenders'' as
Booth Tarkington's ``Magnificent Ambersons'' and Max Beerbohm's
``Zuleika Dobson.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In recent interviews several other members of the judges' panel
expressed reservations about the final Modern Library list.
</P>
<P>
   Calling the selection system employed ``not particularly
scientific,'' Ian Jackman, the Modern Library's managing director,
said he would discard the current tie-breaking system, which had
been used, he said, because it was not practical to refer every
dead-heat back to the full panel of judges. Instead, the library
will use a ranking system based on ``weighted voting.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he was also committed to adding new judges to the panel,
which is made up of members of the editorial board of Modern
Library, to lower the average age and make it more representative
of present-day society.
</P>
<P>
   British novelist A.S. Byatt is the only woman and non-American
so far on the panel, which has no members from racial or ethnic
minorities. Other members are Gore Vidal; Daniel Boorstin, a former
librarian of the Library of Congress; historian Shelby Foote;
Vartan Gregorian, president of Carnegie Corp.; Edmund Morris, a
historian; and John Richardson, the Picasso biographer.

   Commentary: Clinton rappers rock
</P>
<P>
   By Rowland Nethaway
</P>
<P>
   c: 1998 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ ``I have often thought that if there had been a
good rap group around in those days, I might have chosen a career
in music instead of politics,'' mused Richard Nixon in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The timing was off for Nixon, but it might be dead on for Bill
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Bill and Hillary as the ``Two Fer One Rappers.'' They would
rock. MTV. Top of the charts. Huge.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton already has Hollywood friends who give him scripts and
acting lessons so he can appear sincere on television.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon was ahead of Clinton on this score as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sincerity is the quality that comes through on television,''
he told the Washington Star in 1955.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon understood it. Clinton can do it.
</P>
<P>
   The above quotes come from a new book, The Experts Speak, which
is an expanded an updated edition of a 1984 book by the same name.
The authors are Christopher Cerf, a former contributing editor to
the National Lampoon and co-editor of The Politically Correct
Dictionary and Handbook and co-author Victor Navasky, publisher and
editorial director of The Nation.
</P>
<P>
   The book is a collection of quotes from experts _ pundits,
authorities, talking heads, etc. _ who willingly predict,
pontificate and speculate but turn out to be perfectly wrong. Some
of the quotes are instructive compared to current events. Others
</P>
<P>
   are simply entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, in 1996 Henry Aldridge, a North Carolina state
representative, gave this explanation why there was no need for his
state to fund abortions for rape victims. ``People who are raped _
who are truly raped _ the juices don't flow, the body functions
don't work, and they don't get pregnant.''
</P>
<P>
   Other AIDS experts quoted in the book included movie-maker Spike
Lee and Montana Lt. Gov. Dennis Rehberg.
</P>
<P>
   ``AIDS is a government-engineered disease,'' Lee was quoted in
1992. ``The problem with AIDS is: you got it, you die. So why are
we spending money on this issue?'' said Rehberg in 1994 when
arguing for reduced state expenditures for hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   With tobacco lawsuits and settlements in the news, consider the
1962 quote from Sir Charles Ellis, senior scientist for British
American Tobacco Company. ``It is my conviction that nicotine is a
very remarkable, beneficent drug that both helps the body to resist
external stress and also can as a result show a pronounced
tranquilizing effect....''
</P>
<P>
   Guess which expert made the following quote.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must expect the Soviet system to survive in its present
brutish form for a very long time. There will be Soviet labor camps
and Soviet torture chambers well into our great-grandchildren's
lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Give up? It was U.S. Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., five years
before the Soviet collapse.
</P>
<P>
   The book contains quotes from politicians and political experts
who predicted Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton's 1992 presidential
candidacy over following reports that he committed adultery and
lied about dodging the draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Clinton is) a dead stone loser,'' said Democratic pollster
Tubby Harrison.
</P>
<P>
   More quotes predict Clinton's political demise during a
second-term presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Clinton will lose to any Republican nominee who doesn't
drool on the stage,'' said an Oct. 30, 1995 Wall Street Journal
editorial.
</P>
<P>
   Here's another Nixon-Clinton parallel universe quote: ``If the
press continues its zealous overkill on this affair, it is not
likely to destroy either President Nixon or the Nixon
Administration but it will gravely injure something more important
_ the faith of the people in . ... (the) freedom of the press.''
</P>
<P>
   Change the date and the name, and this quote from an April 25,
1973 editorial in the Burlington, Vt. Free Press could appear in a
newspaper today.

PRO-MARIJUANA GROUP WINS RULING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDY RAKOWSKY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ For the third time in a month, a judge has ruled that
the city of Boston violated free speech rights, this time by
rejecting a request from the Massachusetts Cannabis Reform
Coalition for a pro-marijuana rally on Boston Common in October.
</P>
<P>
   Superior Court Judge Carol S. Ball said the First Amendment
requires the Parks Department to issue a permit for Hempfest, which
last year resulted in 150 marijuana-related arrests. But Ball said
the city can set conditions to protect public safety at the rally,
expected to draw 75,000 to 100,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   MassCan's advocacy of civil disobedience by public marijuana
smoking does not allow the city to deny the permit, Ball said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Civil disobedience is a bedrock of our society: The Boston Tea
Party, the Vietnam War protests,'' she said. But the city
overstepped its authority when it made MassCan as a condition of
the permit ``discourage the illegal smoking of marijuana at the
rally'' through public announcements and performers.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Downing, president of MassCan, said in court filings, ``We
will not be coerced into becoming agents, scaring the people with
the very laws we despise.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston police said last year's rally was rife with violations of
city regulations, including unauthorized vendors, more than 30 of
whom had no health permits, one of whom had a 100-pound propane
tank, five times the size of tanks permitted on the Common.
</P>
<P>
   Police also were critical of speakers telling the crowd to
``Light up.'''
</P>
<P>
   MassCan lawyer John Swormley told Ball that there was nothing
illicit about such statements because smoking marijuana is not the
crime, possession is.
</P>
<P>
   The only people who could smoke marijuana on the Common would be
ones who obtained it _ illegally _ before they got there. So
Swormley reasoned, the crime was already committed and thus no
speaker at a rally could be seen as inciting lawless activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cute,'' said Ball. ``You ought to go to work for President
Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the week, Ball ruled that the city violated the free
speech rights of owners of the Paradise Club when the club was shut
down July 8. And last month, US District Judge George A. O'Toole
found that the city trampled the First Amendment rights of the
Nationalist Movement when it denied the Mississippi group's 1994
application for a parade permit.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the city law department welcomed Ball's
recognition of the city's need to manage large events and protect
public property and safety and said the city would issue a permit
with appropriate restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Mayor Thomas M. Menino said the crop of First
Amendment rulings is no reflection on the administration's
policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of these rulings say the city has done anything
unconstitutional, what they take issue with is the way the
ordinances and regulations are written,'' said spokesman John
Dorsey.
</P>
<P>
   City lawyers said the permit would be issued by next Wednesday
and the judge set a hearing on the legality of the restrictions for
Aug. 28. Hempfest is scheduled for Oct. 3.
</P>
<P>
   The Beacon Hill Civic Association as well as the Friends of the
Public Garden and Boston Common weighed in on the Hempfest against
MassCann, contending that the event causes inordinate damage to the
grounds.

AUTO INSURERS SEEK 15.5 PERCENT RATE INCREASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICIA WEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ As expected, the state's auto industry Friday formally
asked state regulators for a 15.5 percent rate increase for next
year, saying the steep hike is needed to make up for lost revenue
from four years of rate reductions.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Johnston, spokesman for the Automobile Insurers Bureau of
Massachusetts, said the rate hike also is needed to cover the
rising cost of repairing cars as people buy more expensive
vehicles. He said the cost of the average repair in 1993 was
$1,283, and now the cost is $1,483.
</P>
<P>
   State insurance regulators last year approved an average 4
percent cut in rates, the fourth consecutive year Massachusetts
drivers have received cuts in auto insurance rates. Last August,
the auto industry had initially sought about a 7 percent hike,
Johnston said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston said the industry has faced a revenue shortfall in the
last several years, which must be reversed. ``Clearly, a reasonable
rate increase is necessary to preserve a stable market in
Massachusetts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Before Friday's official filing with state regulators, some
members of the auto industry earlier this week had begun talking
about a proposed 15.5 percent rate hike. Acting Governor Paul
Cellucci and Attorney General Scott Harshbarger said Thursday they
are against such a sizeable increase.
</P>
<P>
   The insurance commissioner will set rates in December, after
hearing from the industry, Harshbarger, and the State Rating
Bureau, an agency in the Division of Insurance.

`THE AVENGERS' IS A VALIANT TRY, BUT IN THE END IS PRETTY AWFUL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As everyone knows by now, the big-screen version of the
cult-favorite, '60s British TV series, ``The Avengers,'' has become
a pre-release media event for the worst possible reason. Its
studio, Warner Bros., has all but abandoned it.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the blockbuster-wannabe has secsured a place in the
movie record books for being the only film of its budget (more than
$50 million, before promotion costs) so far in the '90s to not have
a premiere, a junket, a press screening or opening-day star
interviews.
</P>
<P>
   So it was with a certain ghoulish fascination that critics and
audiences queued yesterday afternoon for a first look at this
pariah. And the question that every reviewer has to answer today
is: just how bad can this thing possibly be?
</P>
<P>
   Well, to put it in the perspective of the summer, let's say that
it's not as insipid as ``BASEketball,'' as trashy as ``Mafia!,'' as
thoroughly boring as ``How Stella Got Her Groove Back'' or as
ponderously overblown as ``Armageddon.''
</P>
<P>
   The Avengers. Directed by Jeremiah Chechik. Written by Don
Macpherson. Cast: Ralph Fiennes, Uma Thurman, Sean Connery. Warner
Bros. Meridian 16, Guild 45th, Oak Tree, Bella Bottega, Crossroads,
Issaquah 9, Kirkland Parkplace, Woodinville 12, Everett 9, Grand
Cinemas Alderwood, Mountlake 9, Cinema 17, East Valley, Gateway
Center, Kent 6, Lewis and Clark, Valley Drive-in. 91 minutes. Rated
PG-13 for violence and language.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: D+
</P>
<P>
   It's also hard to get too mad at it, because in many respects,
it's a valiant try. Producer Jerry Weintraub has obviously resisted
the studio pressure to junk up the proceedings with today's
standards of bad-taste, and his film stays resolute to the series'
stiff-upper-lip, deadpan silliness.
</P>
<P>
   But it's still a dead movie from fade-in to fade-out. While
there's nothing glaringly or embarrassingly awful about it (except
for maybe the non-script), it simply doesn't engage us _ even for a
minute. Its efforts to make the TV series' unique spirit come alive
in a new and larger medium somehow dismally fail.
</P>
<P>
   A big part of the problem, as always in a flop of this
magnitude, is in the casting. Ralph Fiennes, playing a considerably
younger version of the hero, Jonathan Steed, is pleasant but so
lackluster that he often seems to disappear. Uma Thurman as the
heroine, Mrs. Peel, is better, but her flat delivery and vulnerable
manner are all wrong for the character.
</P>
<P>
   The repartee that was so droll and witty and irresistible from
the mouths of the series' Patrick Macnee and Diana Rigg here seems
mannered and annoying. The stars also have little in the way of
chemistry _ so that when they fall into a passionate kiss
(something that would never happen in the series), you actually
find yourself wanting to look away.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Don Macpherson's script _ something about a
master villain (Sean Connery) trying to manipulate the world's
weather for profit _ is such a travesty of basic story-telling that
it's virtually impossible to follow. You can never quite figure out
any character's motivation in any particular scene.
</P>
<P>
   And Jeremiah Chechik (``Benny and Joon,'' ``Diabolique'') is
never director enough to make the film's style triumph over its
lack of substance _ which is exactly what the TV series did so
well. Its scripts were every bit as silly and gleefully
preposterous, but somehow it didn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   Here, it seems to matter.
</P>
<P>
   In the final analysis, however, it may well be that ``The
Avengers'' belongs to its own unique time and place, and to its own
distinctive stars. It may also be that it belongs on the small
screen _ because blown way up and extended to 91 minutes, even in a
relatively faithful adaptation, it's become something grotesque.
</P>

HONG KONG GOVERNMENT INTERVENES TO STRENGTHEN MARKETS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ After days of speculative attacks on Hong Kong's
currency, the government confirmed Friday that it had intervened to
shore up the stock and futures markets.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Tsang, the financial secretary of Hong Kong, said the
government took the rare step of dipping into its reserves to buy
shares and futures contracts because it thought currency traders
were improperly manipulating the territory's financial markets to
make ``speedy profits.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not tolerate attempts by speculators to manipulate our
interest rates,'' a grim-faced Tsang said as he stood next to the
chairman of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, Joseph Yam, at a news
conference here.
</P>
<P>
   The monetary authority waded into the market to buy Hong Kong
dollars late last week and earlier this week. But the government
refused to characterize those moves as an intervention, saying
instead that the government was merely raising local currency to
finance a temporary budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's action, which was announced after the stock market
closed, is far more aggressive than merely buying dollars. Rumors
of the intervention galvanized the market, which had been battered
by heavy losses all week. The Hang Seng index rebounded 564.27
points, or 8.5 percent, to 7,224.69 _ its ninth-biggest point gain
in history. The index had dropped about 16 percent since the end of
July.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the government's purchases, rumors surfaced
Friday that local companies with ties to the government were also
buying shares to further prop up the Hang Seng.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong's action underscores that, after several weeks in
which the foundering Japanese yen commanded the attention of Asia's
markets, currency trading is turning into a blood sport elsewhere
in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Using remarkably blunt language, Tsang accused traders of
employing ``a whole host of improper measures'' to undermine the
Hong Kong dollar. He said they had spread ``vicious rumors'' that
Hong Kong was going to break its exchange rate, which is linked to
the U.S. dollar; that China was about to devalue its currency, the
yuan; and that Hong Kong's banks were unstable.
</P>
<P>
   Tsang also opened the door to future intervention, though he
cautioned that it would only occur in ``exceptional
circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the government's move rescued the Hang Seng from one of
its most dismal weeks in recent memory, several analysts said the
underlying reasons for Hong Kong's economic woes remained.
</P>
<P>
   ``The weak yen is clearly the fundamental driver, and it is
growing weaker by the day because of domestic developments,'' said
Jan Lee, the chief economist at the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking
Corp. here. ``The Japanese authorities lack the political will to
deliver the necessary changes.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the Japanese yen lost a bit of ground, trading at
146.35 yen to the dollar on Friday, down from 145.16 yen on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's Nikkei index turned in a similarly lackluster
performance, declining 258.09 points, or 1.7 percent, to 15,123.93.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts also said they were troubled by the government's
bellicose tone, which they said could erode the confidence of
investors in Hong Kong.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   They noted that inflammatory remarks about currency traders by
Malaysia's prime minister, Mahatir Mohamed, had alarmed many
investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is legitimate to wage war against speculators in a
calculated manner,'' said Miron Mushkat, a strategist at Indocam
Asia here. ``But Hong Kong is turning this into something of a
jihad against the speculators.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the issue of tough talk, some analysts said they feared
that Hong Kong might be unable to maintain its commitment to a
linked exchange rate when the Japanese yen is spiraling downward
and virtually all of its neighbors have already deeply devalued
their currencies.
</P>
<P>
   Under Hong Kong's monetary regime, known as a currency board,
the Hong Kong dollar is pegged to the U.S. dollar at a ratio of 7.8
to 1. When traders sell the currency in large volumes, the board
can act to raise interbank interest rates, forcing down asset
prices and eventually making the Hong Kong dollar attractive to
investors.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble with such a system is that the government must be
prepared to tolerate painful spikes in interest rates, which can
strangle credit and hobble economic growth. Hong Kong is already
limping through its worst downturn since World War II, with an
unemployment rate of 4.5 percent and a 2.8 percent contraction in
its gross domestic product in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The politicians are absolutely committed to the exchange rate,
but at what cost?'' Lee asked. ``At the cost of a very significant
deflation in Hong Kong _ far more than what I believe people are
willing to tolerate.''
</P>
<P>
   Previous efforts to defend the Hong Kong dollar have resulted in
sharp drops in property prices and on the stock exchange, which is
largely driven by real estate industry values. By last Wednesday,
after several days of intense selling of the Hong Kong dollar, the
Hang Seng index was trading at a five-year low.
</P>
<P>
   Tsang said Friday that the attacks on the Hong Kong dollar were
designed to force a chain reaction of soaring interest rates and
swooning stock prices. He said the same hedge funds that speculated
against the dollar accumulated short positions in the shares of
Hong Kong companies. When those stocks plunged, he said, the hedge
funds stood to profit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is vulnerable to manipulation and has recently
showed signs of becoming one of the main reasons of speculators
attacking the Hong Kong dollar,'' Tsang said.
</P>
<P>
   By engineering a rally in share prices, the government hopes to
inflict heavy losses on the hedge funds _ a punishment it thinks
will dissuade them from speculating on the currency in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Still, analysts said Hong Kong would remain vulnerable to
speculative attacks as long as its currency traded higher than
those of its neighbors. Moreover, the gap between Hong Kong and
other Asian countries seems likely to widen rather than narrow. The
Japanese yen continues to weaken, and despite China's
protestations, many analysts think it will eventually devalue the
yuan.
</P>
<P>
   A Hong Kong brokerage firm released a report on Thursday
predicting that China would devalue the currency at the end of the
year. The firm, Indosuez W.I. Carr Securities, said Beijing would
feel compelled to take such action in order to keep its economic
reform program on track.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this were just a temporary crisis, you could just plug the
gap for a year or so and get back to the reform process later,''
said Michael Taylor, an economist at Indosuez W.I. Carr Securities.
``But it isn't.''

   PALISADE, Colo. _ Parker and Mary Carlson have an unpretentious
attitude about making and marketing their wine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not the swirl, sniff and spit crowd,'' Carlson said.
``Our wines are just meant to be enjoyed. They're light and fruity,
easy drinking.''
</P>
<P>
   Their Carlson Vineyards labels have playful names like Prairie
Dog Blush, Tyrannosaurus Red and Gewurzasaurus. And they are made
from Colorado grapes. Hundreds of acres of cabernet, merlot,
chardonnay and gewurzstraminer are thriving on the western slopes
of the Rocky Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   It is a process being repeated in many states without long
winemaking traditions.
</P>
<P>
   The number of U.S. wineries doubled to 1,817 between 1980 and
1995, the last year for which data are available, according to the
American Vintners Association in Washington. More than half of the
new wineries are outside California. Except for Alaska, North
Dakota and Wyoming, every state in the nation has at least one
winery.
</P>
<P>
   The trade association said New York, Oregon, Washington and
Virginia had a combined total of 379 wineries, up from 138 in 1980.
Pennsylvania, Ohio, Missouri, Texas, Michigan, New Jersey, Indiana
and New Mexico each had 20 or more.
</P>
<P>
   But many of those wineries operate on a fine line between a
pastime and a small business.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wine industry outside of California, Washington, Oregon
and New York tends to be a very small cottage industry, almost a
home industry, one step beyond a hobby,'' said Louis Perdue, who
publishes an Internet newsletter called Wine Investment News. ``The
problem is that they don't make a great deal of wine, and if you
don't make a great deal of wine, it's hard to make a great deal of
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Vic Motto, a partner in Motto, Kryla &AMP; Fisher of St. Helena,
Calif., which provides consultants and accountants for the wine
industry, says vineyards and wineries are capital intensive. A
winery that grows its own fruit typically has assets of $4 to $5
for each dollar of annual sales, Motto said, compared with $1 or
less in assets per dollar of sales for a manufacturing company.
</P>
<P>
   But many small vintners are motivated primarily by a love of
wine and a desire to combine agriculture with an art that has
existed for thousands of years.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a certain romance to it,'' Motto said. ``You're
growing some fruit that you're going to convert into a product that
has a certain amount of mystique to it and charm.''
</P>
<P>
   The winery operations in most states are still dwarfed by
California's labels. Eric Sims, an economist with Motto, Kryla,
estimated that California wines accounted for 90 percent to 95
percent of the $16 billion in sales of U.S.-made wines in 1997.
Most of the rest came from New York and Washington, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Simon Siegl, president of the American Vintners Association,
said advances in scientific knowledge have helped spread commercial
vineyards into new regions. New tools and techniques include more
effective fungicide applications, better water management and
improved ways of dealing with severe cold weather, which is not a
problem in California's grape-growing regions.
</P>
<P>
   ``In years past, the growers just didn't have the tools to win
out against nature,'' Siegl said. ``As more and more research
delivers better tools to the winemaker, it's more feasible for wine
to be produced in some of these regions.''
</P>
<P>
   Colorado's tiny emerging wine industry is an example of how
winemaking is proliferating throughout the United States.
</P>
<P>
   At 4,700 to 6,400 feet above sea level, the Colorado vineyards
are among the highest in the world, but the area's radiant summer
days and cool nights are great for grapes, and improved vineyard
management techniques are helping to solve problems of long, cold
winters.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, the state had two commercial wineries. Now there are
21, according to the Colorado Wine Industry Development Board. Five
new Colorado wineries received licenses in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Carlson Vineyards, south of Palisade in the Grand Valley of the
Colorado River, is typical of the recent trends.
</P>
<P>
   The winery has three acres of its own vineyard and buys ``seven
acres' worth'' of grapes from other growers in the area, to make
about 15,000 gallons of wine a year. Carlson, 52, said he expected
to sell about $350,000 worth of wine this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Carlsons started their winery in 1988. ``We were home
winemakers for about 10 or 15 years before that, so it's just a
hobby that got out of control,'' Carlson said.
</P>
<P>
   For the first four years, Carlson also continued working at his
supervisory job at a Coors ceramics plant in nearby Grand Junction.
He has taken short winemaking courses at the University of
California at Davis, the American mecca of viniculture education,
and some of his wines _ including the 1995 Gewurzasaurus _ have won
medals in national competitions.
</P>
<P>
   Like other vintners interviewed in the area, Carlson was
reluctant to talk about profits. He said that the winery produces a
taxable income, ``but it's all going back into the business.''
</P>
<P>
   Douglas and Susan Phillips have a cabinet full of medals in the
tasting room of their Plum Creek Winery beside U.S. 6 in Palisade.
The prize they are proudest of is a gold medal from the 1992 San
Francisco Fair for their 1990 Grand Mesa, a blend of merlot and
cabernet franc.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Phillips said people at the California competition, whose
knowledge of Colorado's fledgling wineries was sketchy at best,
were dumbfounded. ```Who are these guys?' _ that's what they were
saying about us,'' Mrs. Phillips said.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillipses are both lawyers in Denver, three hours over the
Rockies from Palisade. But the couple spends more than 40 extended
weekends a year working at their winery and 55 acres of vineyards,
helped by a dozen full-time employees and as many seasonal workers.
</P>
<P>
   They opened the winery in 1984 and Phillips estimated that they
had invested ``considerably more than $2 million'' in the venture,
first breaking even after seven years.
</P>
<P>
   This year, he predicted, total sales of grapes and wine will be
$800,000 to $900,000, but he declined to discuss profits or losses
for the privately held company.
</P>
<P>
   The Colorado Wine Industry Development Board expects 1998 sales
of 79,000 gallons for all microvintners in the state which amounts
to less than 1 percent of the Colorado retail wine market,
according to John Lowey, the group's executive director. The
board's long-term goal is for Colorado wines to win 10 percent of
the state's 9-million-gallon market.
</P>
<P>
   Total sales of all wine in the United States increased from 449
million gallons in 1993 to 508 million gallons in 1996, according
to the American Vintners Association.

<P>
   Siegl, the president of the association, said the improving
quality of wines made throughout the country had contributed to the
growth of wineries by giving consumers more confidence in what they
buy.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're getting better and better wine every time they turn
around,'' Siegl said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in western Colorado, viniculturists say, a dry
climate helps prevent vine disease; intense summer sunlight gives
grapes good color and flavor, and low nighttime temperatures
promote acid retention, which is regarded as a key to premium
winemaking. But potential problems in Colorado include severe
winter cold, which can damage vines, and late spring frosts, which
can abort the budding process.
</P>
<P>
   The Colorado wine board, which is financed with a small share of
state taxes on wine, pays for a research station and experimental
vineyard operated near Palisade by Colorado State University.
Growers and winemakers say Richard Hamman Jr., a viniculturist who
operates the research station, has helped improve the area's grape
crops and wines.
</P>
<P>
   Hamman said that many local wines were still mediocre. But he
said the industry had the potential to expand in western Colorado,
with up to 3,500 acres suitable for vineyards.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not ever going to be a Napa in terms of size,'' he said.
``But the quality _ we can make just as good a grape here as they
can in California, for most varieties.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamman has experimented with different varieties of grapevines
to find those that adapt well to the Colorado climate, and many do.
But no variety resisted a cold wave in February 1989 that dropped
temperatures to 23 degrees below zero and damaged most vine tissue
above ground level. Colorado produced almost no grapes that year.
</P>
<P>
   In seminars for growers on how to reduce winter damage, he
teaches such techniques as reducing water to vines in the late
summer to hasten their winter acclimation process and delaying
pruning until late in the winter to leave more dormant buds in case
some are damaged by winter freezing.
</P>
<P>
   Many growers have installed electric wind machines, huge fans
that dissipate low layers of frosty air. And Hamman is also working
on an experimental spray of water, sugar and an acid taken from
ground seaweed that can postpone the time when buds pop out, a
precaution against late spring frosts.
</P>
<P>
   Richard and Padte Turley operate Colorado's oldest and largest
winery. The Turleys bought a fruit farm near Palisade in 1977 and
converted orchards to vineyards in 1985. They sold grapes to
Colorado Mountain vineyard, a pioneering Colorado winery that was
operating in the red. In 1989, they bought the winery from its
absentee owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason I bought it is they weren't making any money, so
they couldn't buy my grapes any more,'' Turley said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the grape-crop busts in 1989 and 1991, the Turleys
managed to keep the winery alive by importing grapes from
California. It is now called Colorado Cellars Ltd. and its sales
have been growing at about 10 percent a year, reaching $630,000 in
1997. The winery makes about 25,000 gallons a year, although Turley
declined to discuss the company's earnings in detail.
</P>
<P>
   One problem Colorado wineries have struggled with is getting
Denver-based distributors interested in their wines. Turley, who
worked as a distributor before buying the winery, tackled the
problem by hiring a sales manager and buying a van to deliver his
wine throughout Colorado. He says Colorado Cellars wines are sold
at about 3,500 restaurants and liquor stores, more than half of the
licensed outlets in the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're selling everything we make,'' he said.

SCORES MOURN DEATH OF SCHIZOPHRENIC MAN WHO SCOURED FIELDS FOR
RUBBISH 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (For release Sunday, Aug. 16) 
 
(Attn: Fort Lauderdale, Fla.) 
 
By ALLAN TURNER 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Maybe they meant well, those doctors, nurses and
strange people who claimed to be his relatives. But Eric Hill, his
body riddled with cancer, his mind fogged by schizophrenia, was
confused, fearful and restless. People bothered him _ always had _
and this nursing home seemed a prison.
</P>
<P>
   Eric yearned to go home, back to his wooden crate in a field in
northwest San Antonio. He wanted to resume his self-appointed
``job,'' obsessively cleaning the minutest speck of rubbish from
the fields and roadsides of San Antonio's medical center area.
</P>
<P>
   That had been his life since he had slipped away from his
sister's home in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., back in 1982. And that was
the way he wanted it.
</P>
<P>
   Like millions of other homeless people _ roughly a fourth of
them seriously mentally ill _ Eric was a goad to the conscience and
an affront to the senses. He was dirty, and he stank.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many of the others, though, in his own way, Eric was
rated an asset to his community. And when he died earlier this
month, he did not do so unmourned.
</P>
<P>
   Last Tuesday, as cicadas buzzed rhythmically in the live oaks,
more than 100 people who live or work near Eric's crude home
gathered to remember the life of a homeless man who really hadn't
been homeless, a friendless man who had friends.
</P>
<P>
   They sang songs and scattered his ashes.
</P>
<P>
   Among those present were employees from a nearby Southwest
Airlines office, police officers, former San Antonio Mayor Bill
Thornton, who lives in the area, and a Hill family friend, Kenneth
Lewis, a beret-wearing hermit monk from the mountains of New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been touched by God through Eric,'' said the Rev. John
Payne, one of two San Antonio clergymen on hand to eulogize the
curly haired recluse.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people were to see a picture of Eric or were told about him
for the first time,'' said Thornton, a local dentist, ``they would
take him for a homeless man with nothing to do. That was not the
case. Eric was deeply rooted in that area by his choice, by his
investment in building what was his home and by his work.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a daily basis, he worked sunup to sundown to clean that
area. I don't mean refuse that was easily visible. He'd pick up gum
wrappers and cigarette butts. Those of us who lived or worked
there, we saw Eric as part of the community and a very positive
part.''
</P>
<P>
   Thornton said he is exploring possible ways Eric can be
memorialized.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be a matter of putting a marker up on a 300-year-old
tree or creating a small park area that's for meditation, not
play,'' he said. ``It could be a matter of putting up a plaque in
this rapidly changing area saying that Eric lived here, who he was
and what he did.''
</P>
<P>
   Eric's sister, Debbie Hill, now the owner of an antique shop in
New Hampshire, recalled that there was little in her brother's
early life that hinted at the strange turns it would take. No one
would have guessed that Eric, a fastidious groomer, one day would
be scraping his beard with a disposable razor scavenged from the
garbage or washing himself down with a garden hose.
</P>
<P>
   Theirs was an average childhood in a middle-class Illinois
family. If Eric seemed something of a loner, his drop-dead good
looks more than compensated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The girls would be calling him,'' his sister said.
</P>
<P>
   After high school, Eric enrolled in college, intent on becoming
an optometrist.
</P>
<P>
   All seemed well until 1974, when Eric's mother unexpectedly
died, shortly after the family moved to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some theories that kind of trauma can trigger
schizophrenia,'' Debbie Hill said. ``Over the next four years,
there would be oddities in his behavior. Nothing major. Two weeks
before our father died in September 1978, Eric was diagnosed as a
paranoid schizophrenic.''
</P>
<P>
   Eric was prescribed powerful medicines to control his demons.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't like the way they made him feel. There were lethargy
and horrible side effects,'' his sister said. ``Or he'd feel better
and he'd stop taking them.''
</P>
<P>
   Living with his sister, Eric was driven by his illness. He heard
voices. He fretted that people meant to harm him. He'd unexpectedly
leave home for weeks or months at a time. In 1982, he left Florida
and never returned.
</P>
<P>
   About that time, San Antonians who had occasion to be on the
city's northwest side began to notice a strange, shambling man
collecting garbage along the roadways.
</P>
<P>
   ``I met him as I was going to the hospital where I was a
chaplain,'' said Payne. ``Around Wurzbach and Interstate 10, I saw
this frail, thin man walking, bending down, picking up trash and
carrying a trash bag. I stopped and tried to talk with him, but he
became agitated and pretended to throw a rock.''
</P>
<P>
   Payne approached Eric again the next day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him I was a chaplain and asked if there was anything he
needed,'' Payne said. ``He looked at me with piercing blue eyes and
didn't respond. Then he said that he had everything he needed.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Others had similar experiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eric was not a person who wanted to make friends,'' Thornton
said.
</P>
<P>
   Once, on a searingly hot day, Thornton saw Eric picking up
garbage along a highway median. ``I thought it was just too hot,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Returning some time later, Thornton found Eric still at work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I drove by and bought a liter of soft drink and drove back on
the grassy median to give it to him,'' he said. ``But the moment I
headed toward Eric, he bolted. He crossed I-10 without looking at
all. He was simply getting away from me. &UR;  &LR; It was a very frightening
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Eric became somewhat more at ease with his neighbors as years
passed, but his behavior remained strange. He would argue with
unseen people. Once, he was seen quarreling with a cactus _ an
episode that ended when Eric angrily swatted the plant with his
bare hands.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he was gentle and some of the neighborhood children began
calling him ``Jesus Christ.''
</P>
<P>
   He was proud _ never accepting handouts. ``Eric was never seen
sitting idly somewhere, or, worse, drinking a quart of beer,''
Thornton said.
</P>
<P>
   One frigid winter's day, Payne _ his car laden with shoes,
jackets and other cold-weather gear _ offered Eric his choice of
clothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't need anything,'' Eric responded. Then he paused. ``I
guess I could take these,'' he said, reaching for three garbage
bags. Eric frequently wore the garbage bags in cold weather,
insulating them with discarded newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``He felt collecting garbage was his work,'' Debbie Hill said.
``He felt he had to work in order to be entitled to eat out of the
Dumpsters.''
</P>
<P>
   Area hospitals and restaurants often left meals near the
Dumpsters, but the food, like other items, had to be disguised as
garbage or Eric would reject it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He led a simple life,'' said Lewis, the Catholic monk. ``Here
was a man who was surviving _ prospering, even _ on the refuse of a
throwaway society.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last September, Eric was found lying beside a medical center
roadway. He was taken to a hospital, where he was diagnosed with
advanced myeloma, a cancer of the bone marrow. Several
disease-related fractures of his spine also were detected.
</P>
<P>
   In December, guardianship proceedings were begun for Eric in a
San Antonio court. It was at this point that Debbie Hill was
located.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eric had told them that he had a sister in Florida and an aunt
and uncle somewhere in Wisconsin,'' the sister said. ``But they
hadn't been able to locate us. There was a lawyer connected to the
case who was troubled, and he told me he went home that night and
decided to make one more try. He sat and prayed that this would be
it, then he called up the Internet. He found my cousin in
Florida.''
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, Debbie Hill said, she received a telephone call at
her New Hampshire home.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told me they had found Eric,'' she said. ``Then they told
me he was dying. It was a very bittersweet call.''
</P>
<P>
   In February, she arrived in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw Eric on the side of the street,'' she said. ``My heart
almost leapt out of my body. I immediately stopped the car and
watched this dirty, disheveled homeless person shuffling along,
because of his broken back, picking up garbage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sure tears were pouring down my face. I was joyful to
see him again. I approached him, real gentle, and said, `Hi, Eric.'
He said, `Hi' and then walked the other way.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Payne attempted to introduce them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen this person before,'' Eric responded. ``I
don't know who she is. She's not my sister, she's a look-alike.''
</P>
<P>
   She and her family rented an apartment near Eric's crate. They
gave Eric the address and told him to visit anytime. He never did.
</P>
<P>
   For the next six months Debbie Hill, often accompanied by her
husband, Doug Clickenger, and their two young children, spent hours
with Eric in and out of the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Once, she gave Eric a small angel lapel pin that an airplane
seatmate had given her.
</P>
<P>
   ``He let me pin that angel pin on that dirty sweatshirt,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day, he and I and the kids would sit behind the Dumpster
or along the street for two or three hours,'' she said. ``Even
though he didn't know who I was, he allowed a connection he hadn't
allowed other people.''
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end, perhaps as a result of antipsychotic drugs
administered with his pain medication, Eric began to recognize his
family.
</P>
<P>
   But the progress was agonizingly slow. Eric agreed to let his
sister's children call him ``uncle,'' but then he confided to
nursing home staff that he was only pretending to be their uncle.
At one point, he acknowledged Debbie Hill was his sister.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hated being in the nursing home,'' Debbie Hill recalled.
``Every time he would see me, he would beg and beg me to get him
out. He wanted so badly to go back to his field. Finally, one week
before he died, he said, `You're my family. You can get me out of
here.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He was sick. I couldn't understand why he was even up and
living and moving. Finally, I promised him I would take him home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I have fulfilled that promise.''

CLINTON OWES U.S. THE UNVARNISHED VERSION ABOUT LEWINSKY  
 (EMBARGOED FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 16)  
 (THIS EDITORIAL WILL APPEAR IN SUNDAY'S ARIZONA REPUBLIC) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - President Clinton faces a daunting challenge Monday
before a federal grand jury, and the future of his embattled
administration _ not to mention his desperately sought historical
legacy _ hangs in the balance.
</P>
<P>
   Eight months after promising the American people ``more rather
than less, sooner rather than later'' about the Monica Lewinsky
affair, we hear he may try to square his testimony with the complex
web of evasions, diversions, delays and apparent lies that he and
his minions have spun in a frantic effort to postpone this day of
reckoning into a new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Advisers creating strategy based on definition of act,'' read
Friday's disturbing headline.
</P>
<P>
   We suggest he try something else _ the unadorned truth, without
calculated spin, memory lapses or grammatical subterfuge. It's
easier and despite its many risks on the heels of so much dizzying
rhetorical footwork, it's also safer.
</P>
<P>
   And when he's done, he should go one step further and tell the
whole unvarnished story to the overpromised American people.
</P>
<P>
   Legally, of course, he has no obligation to do the latter (or
even the former, if he's gutsy enough to assume the role of a
criminal and invoke the Fifth Amendment). But a president is more
than a citizen entitled to presumptions of privacy and certain
legal safeguards.
</P>
<P>
   He is a public servant who surrendered most of his privacy claim
two decades ago. He now owes the nation an explanation that will
restore a measure of credibility to the office he has immeasurably
cheapened and bring an end to this tawdry affair staining the
nation's honor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only sex,'' his defenders argue. ``If he lied, it doesn't
matter because it's none of our business.'' But they are wrong. It
does matter. Presidential lies can't be neatly sorted. Official
credibility is not divisible.
</P>
<P>
   As Thomas Friedman recently noted in the ``New York Times,'' in
a world where Russia has 20,000 nuclear warheads and an
impoverished arms industry eager for business, where the Asian
economy is spiraling downward, where Kosovo and Albania are
``imploding,'' where Saddam Hussein blocks U.N. weapons inspectors
and Iran is testing a long-range missile, American credibility
matters deeply. And the president, for better or worse, owns the
lone world superpower's only singular voice.
</P>
<P>
   To this task, only the truth, the whole truth, will suffice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't inhale'' will not work, nor will the oft-employed
``not that I recall'' of his last testimony under oath in January.
Forget ``mistakes were made.'' And if he tries, as suggested by
Friday's news accounts, to explain that oral sex is not the
``sexual relations'' he so firmly denied, he will become a global
laughingstock and his presidency will effectively end, no matter
how Kenneth Starr's report later plays out in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Will Americans forgive him the truth? We don't know. If it turns
out he has been less than truthful, there will be a political price
to be paid _ possibly even impeachment, although Congress now seems
to have little stomach for it. But better he pay it than the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Forgive? Maybe. But not forget. The only worse outcome from
Monday's testimony than more of this destructive dance of deception
would be that we learn nothing from it. Bill Clinton can help the
nation learn by first accepting his own culpability. &QL;

BURIALS (Washington) - For the second time in a month, House
Veterans Affairs Committee Chairman and Arizonan Bob Stump is
protesting the burial of American heroes in Arlington National
Cemetery. The Clinton Administration requested waivers of the
veterans' service requirement for burial in the nations most
hallowed ground for three embassy employees killed in a terrorist
blast. Stump says burying non-veterans there is `wrong` and he's
still trying to fix it. Stump also protested the burial of an
unqualified Capitol Police officer killed by a madman while
defending the Capitol. By ADRIANNE FLYNN. Story will move in the

 &QL; 
PAYBACK (Undated) - The 70-something woman had survived a long
marriage of abuse. She had been thrown through a storm door,
suffering severe cuts. She had been tossed into a wall, dislocating
her shoulder. Now it was her turn. Her husband was in the next
room, elderly, helpless, pleading for his dinner. &UR; As couples live
longer, with women staying healthier than their men, experts say
extended payback may be steadily increasing. By MAUREEN WEST. Story

 &QL; 
PERMITS (Undated) - After being acquitted last year for trespassing
on Mount Graham while praying for his daughters passage into
womanhood, Wendsler Nosie hoped the University of Arizona would
lighten up. Instead the U of A, in an attempt to protect its
controversial telescopes, is requiring ``prayer permits,'' a policy
that Nosie and other traditional Apaches say is an attack on their
religious freedom. Nosie and 50 young Native Americans from across
Arizona will run 100 miles Saturday from the San Carlos Apache
reservation to the top of Mount Graham, to pray. And they will not
attempt to acquire permits to do so. By STEVE YOZWIAK. Story will
move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
PATTERNS (Undated) - Nothing defines the human mind so much as its
propensity for discovering patterns. But are the patterns really
``there,'' or do we cast the patterns on a reality that has no
meaningful pattern? A new film, ``Pi,`` raises some of the
questions. By RICHARD NILSEN. Story moved in the ``L`` category.

FAMILY-TV (Undated) - Rupert Murdoch buys the Family Channel, and
now remakes it in his craven image. The result will attempt to
compete against the Disney Channel, Nickelodeon and the Cartoon
Network, but how will it escape the Fox brand taint? And there's
this: the 700 club will still air mid-morning, breaking up a

PARENTS (Undated) - ``You can do everything possible by long

there in the middle of the night.'' That is 42-year-old Bonnie
Hughes Marcus, expressing the anxiety she feels about living in
Ohio and trying to be a good, long-distance daughter to her 81 and
82-year-old Phoenix parents. She believes that their family has a
strong foundation of love, but it's still hard for her to know if

RUSSIA'S MARKETS RALLY AS WESTERN POWERS DISCUSS RESCUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russia's financial markets rallied Friday after the
Kremlin and the major Western powers indicated that they were
working on still further plans to end the nation's economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   But with banks still shaky and the memory of Thursday's panic
fresh in their minds, brokers and analysts said they were not so
much optimistic about a solution as relieved that Friday's markets
had not completed the collapse that began the day before.
</P>
<P>
   After losing almost 6.5 percent of their value Thursday, Russian
blue-chip stocks regained about 4 percent Friday. Nine-month
government bonds were yielding about 150 percent, well under the
200-percent-plus yields of Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   President Boris Yeltsin, breaking his summer vacation Friday to
inspect a meat-processing factory in the ancient city of Novgorod,
insisted there would be no devaluation of the ruble _ ``that's firm
and definite.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That would signify that there was a disaster and that
everything was collapsing,'' he added. ``On the contrary,
everything is going as it should.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin said Yeltsin had a lengthy telephone conversation
with President Clinton on Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   (In Washington, White House press secretary Mike McCurry said
Friday that Clinton and Yeltsin did not discuss whether a new aid
package from the West would be needed. ``This was not a phone call
about money. It was a phone call about doing the things necessary''
to stabilize the struggling economy, McCurry said. ``They discussed
some of the steps that will be necessary to, over the long term,
assure economic stability in Russia,'' he added.)
</P>
<P>
   The banking system, which became the focus of Thursday's panic
after it became clear that some major banks were unable to repay
major loans, remained solvent, if short of foreign currency. Moscow
banks were open Friday, although many refused to sell their
customers dollars. The city's hundreds of hole-in-the-wall currency
exchanges were selling dollars, sometimes at exorbitant rates, but
many had posted ``No dollars'' signs by day's end.
</P>
<P>
   The Central Bank was trading currency at the rate of about 6.3
rubles per dollar. But at some currency exchanges around town, the
rate approached 7 rubles per dollar. ``It looks as though they
avoided a run on the banks, which was the nightmare we were staring
at this morning,'' said Tom Adshead, co-director of research for
Moscow's United Financial Group. ``The foreign-exchange market
dried up. But fortunately, nobody's clamoring for their money.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For the moment, the critical question is whether the banks will
do as well next week. Thursday's crisis was rooted in months of
speculating by some banks in high-yield government bonds and
currency ``forwards'' _ contracts to buy or sell currencies at
specified future dates. The banks had bet that the ruble would
remain stable and that the bond prices would not collapse _ and
when their bets soured, they were unable to cover their losses.
</P>
<P>
   More currency contracts will fall due next week, and the ruble's
weak status means that some banks may have to absorb large trading
losses. As occurred this week, other banks that put up government
bonds as collateral for loans could be asked to produce more money
now that the bonds have lost much of their value, a practice known
as a margin call.
</P>
<P>
   But Russia's central bank has begun pumping money into some of
the most illiquid banks, and analysts said it was spending still
more money to keep the value of the ruble from deteriorating
further. That pleased investors, but it is uncertain how long the
Central Bank, which has but $17 billion in reserves, can continue
without outside help.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's leaders continued to reject calls to devalue the ruble,
a move that would reduce the nation's debt, but would also ignite
inflation, destroy investors' confidence and provoke a political
showdown with Communists and nationalists.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin made a point of noting that he had not even broken his
summer vacation to return to Moscow, but instead had directed Prime
Minister Sergei Kiriyenko to press ahead with an overhaul of tax
and budget policies that is seen as critical if the government is
to remain solvent.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin also summoned the Communist-controlled lower house of
Parliament into emergency session to address the fiscal crisis.
Because the Duma has refused to meet, Yeltsin has been forced to
issue a series of legally dubious decrees ordering the measures
Kiriyenko is undertaking.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday, the Communists, apparently struck by the seriousness
of the collapse, grudgingly agreed to convene, still insisting that
they would have nothing to do with tax increases and other
controversial provisions of the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials said that finance ministers of the major
Western industrial powers were already talking about how they might
mount another loan package or other assistance to steer Russia away
from bankruptcy.

U.S. JUDGE RULES AGAINST VOUCHERS FOR RELIGIOUS SCHOOLS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio, Ariz., Vt., Wis.)   (bl)  
 By LAURIE GOODSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Small towns in Maine that do not have their own public high
schools routinely cover the costs for their children to attend
private schools or public schools in neighboring districts.
</P>
<P>
   But three families in Minot, a town of 1,664 people in
southwestern Maine, wanted the town to pay their children's tuition
at a Roman Catholic school.
</P>
<P>
   This week, in the most recent of several rulings on the use of
vouchers for religious schools, a federal judge ruled against them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plaintiffs certainly are free to send their children to a
sectarian school. That is a right protected by the Constitution,''
D. Brock Hornby, chief judge of the U.S. District Court in Maine,
wrote in his ruling Tuesday. ``The law is clear, however, that they
do not have the right to require taxpayers to subsidize that
choice.''
</P>
<P>
   That holds true whether a school district operates its own
public high schools or not, Hornby added.
</P>
<P>
   The use of vouchers for religious schools has become a
monumental church-state issue that could be headed for a Supreme
Court review as early as this fall.
</P>
<P>
   In June, the Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled that the city of
Milwaukee could use public money to subsidize a private religious
school education, a decision expected to be appealed to the U.S.
Supreme Court within the next month.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there are voucher cases awaiting judgment by state
supreme courts in Ohio, Arizona, Vermont and Maine. (The Maine case
is separate, but similar, to the Minot case decided this week by
Hornby.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's rare for a similar constitutional issue to be moving
toward the Supreme Court in as many forums as this
simultaneously,'' said Clint Bolick, litigation director at the
Institute for Justice, a libertarian public policy law firm based
in Washington that is representing parents in several school
voucher cases. ``As a result, I think the odds are awfully good
that the U.S. Supreme Court will be dealing with one of these cases
in the next year.''
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate legal outcome of the voucher controversy could
reshape American education.
</P>
<P>
   Among the supporters of vouchers for religious schools are
Catholic groups, conservative Christian evangelicals and Orthodox
Jewish groups, all of whom operate private religious schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vouchers level the playing field,'' said Sister Mary Ann
Walsh, spokeswoman for the U.S. Catholic Conference. ``The poor are
entitled to quality education. The wealthy have always been able to
get it.''
</P>
<P>
   The opponents of vouchers include teachers unions, civil
liberties groups, church-state separatists and the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People. They maintain
that diverting money, and the most motivated students and their
families, to private schools of any kind will undermine the public
school system. Some groups, including Jews and African-Americans,
are divided over the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of vouchers had expected the Maine case that was
decided this week to be a strong one because the state already uses
taxpayer money to pay for private school tuition, said Vincent
McCarthy, the Northeast counsel for the American Center for Law and
Justice, a conservative public interest law firm founded by Pat
Robertson.
</P>
<P>
   Maine once paid tuitions for private religious and nonreligious
schools until 1987, when the state attorney general decided that
such a practice was unconstitutional, McCarthy said.
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy represented the three families in Minot that brought
the suit against the Maine Department of Education and its
commissioner. The families had sent their children to St. Dominic's
Regional High School, a Catholic school in nearby Lewiston, where
the annual tuition was $3,850.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our position is, once a state decides to fund private
education they have to do it neutrally,'' McCarthy said in an
interview. ``They can't discriminate against religious schools and
people.''
</P>
<P>
   But in his ruling, Hornby said Maine was not ``constitutionally
required to extend subsidies to sectarian schools,'' and added, ``I
find no authority for such a requirement.''
</P>
<P>
   Barry Lynn, executive director of Americans United for
Separation of Church and State, which provided legal aid in the
case, said: ``This decision sends a strong message that taxpayers
should never be forced to support private religious education. The
Maine case was one more attempt to tear down public education and
introduce a voucher program subsidizing private religious schools.
The court rightly said no.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hornby's ruling seemed to leave the door open to vouchers
for religious schools. He wrote that ``whether Maine might permit
its school districts ultimately to choose to provide such options
and whether the practice would be constitutional is a case for
another day.''
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy said he planned to file an appeal with the 1st U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston, on Monday.

SERONO TO CLOSE PLANT IN MASSACHUSETTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Serono Laboratories, which less than three years ago trumpeted
a &UR;  &LR; $40 million expansion of its biomanufacturing facility in
Randolph, Mass., said Friday it will close the plant in November
and dismiss 100 employees.
</P>
<P>
   The United States subsidiary of The Aeres-Serono Group of
Geneva, Switzerland said production of the two drugs made &UR;  &LR; in
Randolph _ human growth hormone and Serostim, an AIDS medication _
will be shifted to newer and larger facilities in Switzerland and
Spain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cessation of our activities in Randolph is the consequence
of production efficiencies achieved at our other recombinant human
growth hormone manufacturing plants,'' said Jean-Pierre Verhassel,
senior executive vice president, &UR;  &LR; manufacturing, of Aeres-Serono .
``As a result of this increased capacity, we can no longer justify
the production of growth hormone at the Randolph facility.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision to shutter the firm's only American production
facility follows a series of legal challenges &UR;  &LR;  by Genentech Corp.
Human growth hormone _ one of the first biotechnology-developed
drugs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration _ was
initially developed by Genentech Corp. When Aeres-Serono, which &UR;  &LR; 
developed a similar drug, sought to market the product in the U.S.,
Genentech successfully sued &UR;  &LR;  to block its U.S. distribution . As a
result, Serono could produce the drug in Randolph solely for
overseas sales.
</P>
<P>
   Serono's manufacturing shutdown &UR;  &LR;  follows a series of
 &UR;  &LR; decisions by smaller Massachusetts biotechnology companies &UR;  &LR; to
outsource drug production and focus on research.
</P>
<P>
   A Serono spokeswoman said closing the Randolph facility will not
affect the more than 300 employees at the company's U.S. commercial
operations headquartered in Norwell, Mass. or Aeres Advanced
Technology, a research facility also located in Randolph.
</P>
<P>
   Verhassel said the company will try to find jobs for the 100
dismissed manufacturing employees. Serono will continue to operate
its warehousing and distribution facility in Randolph, which
employs 15 people, a company spokeswoman said.

   ``The Avengers,'' shielded from advance viewing by the withering
eyes of critics, arrived on movie screens Friday with a muffled
thud, missing almost entirely the teasing deadpan byplay between
the veddy, veddy British agents John Steed and Emma Peel. In the
mid-to-late '60s, ``The Avengers'' was a conspicuous part of the
British invasion of American pop culture, trailing in the wake of
James Bond and the Beatles.
</P>
<P>
   Although it's easy enough to spot the origins of the TV
``Avengers'' in the extravagant James Bond spoofs, it owed as much
to the throwaway surrealism of ``A Hard Day's Night.'' The
incongruity-filled capers calling upon the lethal sang-froid of
Steed and Mrs. Peel ranged from nominal to campy. The fun came from
watching their shared sense of unruffled style.
</P>
<P>
   At their best, they scarcely seemed to notice the criminal
activity erupting around them. They were too busy engaging in
pursuits such as sculpture or chess, or at least having the cool
cockiness to pretend to be. The best moment, one of the few that
seem alive in the new movie starring Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman
in the roles originated by Patrick MacNee and Diana Rigg, comes
when they're playing between-the-lines sexual chess during a game
of actual chess.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, the movie largely seems a spent force. Or perhaps an
unspent force. Fiennes, impeccable in his bowler hat, tailored
suit, sword cane, and bulletproof waistcoat, has the cool murmur
down cold. Thurman looks sensationally slinky in a succession of
clingy outfits, but is too ill at ease to muster the nonchalance
that made Mrs. Peel so entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   That she should be at a loss is understandable, especially
whenever she's asked to fight an evil clone of herself. The film
rides a pretext rather than anything that might be thought of as a
real plot. It must have seemed a coup to cast Sean Connery as the
villain _ Bond gone bad and turned into the enemy. But Connery's
role as a mad Scottish meteorologist, bent on world domination by
seeding clouds selectively and thus controlling climate, lacks the
light-handed playfulness that made him the best of the Bonds, the
only one really.
</P>
<P>
   Although the role of over-the-top tartan-plaid heavy must have
appealed to his Scottish nationalism on some level, Connery, too,
comes across as overwrought and uncomfortable. Only Eileen Atkins,
playing a droll embodiment of grandmotherly muscle, escapes
unscathed as the film collapses under a weight of special effects,
much as the ``X-Files'' movie did. The problem with ``The
Avengers'' on the big screen isn't that it doesn't make sense, but
that it doesn't make the right kind of nonsense.

APPLE ROLLS OUT IMAC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fourteen years ago, a woman with a sledgehammer introduced
television audiences to Apple Computer Inc.'s Macintosh computer.
Today, Apple hopes to achieve the same kind of impact as it
launches a daring new computer called iMac.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts say the iMac will enjoy strong sales, as
longtime Mac users trade up from older machines. But they are
skeptical the new model will attract significant numbers of people
using personal computers based on Microsoft Corp.'s Windows
operating systems and Intel Corp.'s Pentium processors.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Apple is giving iMac a rousing sendoff. It will be the
biggest product launch in the Cupertino, Calif.-based company's
history, with $100 million of advertising planned. There'll be
prime-time TV ads, and billboards with slogans like ``Chic. Not
geek'' and ``I think, therefore iMac.''
</P>
<P>
   The most visible aspect of the campaign will be the iMac itself,
a translucent blue-white ovoid that looks as if it were designed in
a wind tunnel. The all-in-one unit carries a $1,299 price tag.
That's cheap for a Macintosh, especially one with a built-in
monitor and speakers, a CD-ROM drive, 32 megabytes of memory, a
four-gigabyte hard drive, and a 56-kilobits-per-second modem. There
is even a high-speed connection to Ethernet networks, so that the
iMac can be used in business offices.
</P>
<P>
   Macintosh fans have lusted after the iMac since a prototype was
unveiled in May. Apple said earlier this week that it had taken
150,000 advance orders for the computer, raising fears of
shortages.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are building them as quickly as possible,'' said iMac
product manager Tom Boger. ``We expect to have tens of thousands of
them available by Saturday.''
</P>
<P>
   But there will be shortages of add-on devices like printers and
disk drives. That's due to the iMac's unusual design. The computer
does not include the usual floppy disk drive. Nor does it have the
standard external device ports for plugging in printers and other
devices. Instead, all add-ons must be connected using a new
technology called Universal Serial Bus, or USB. Unfortunately, few
USB devices have reached the market. For instance, Imation Corp. is
taking orders for a USB external disk drive for $189, but units
will not be available until later this month.
</P>
<P>
   Some Mac fans say the lack of accessories will cause them to
delay their decision about buying an iMac. ``I have a scanner and a
Zip drive that as far as I know, I won't be able to connect to
it,'' said Michael Rankin of Weymouth, an electronic production
specialist for Houghton Mifflin Co. ``I'll keep checking the Web
for news, and if it still sounds good around Christmas time, I
might get one then.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the nation's biggest maker of personal computers, Apple has
seen its market share plummet in recent years. According to
preliminary figures from International Data Corp., the slide
continued in the second quarter of 1998. The figures put Apple's
share of worldwide desktop computer sales at 3.1 percent, down from
3.2 percent in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Few industry-watchers think that the iMac will do much to
reverse this trend. ``You need more than this,'' said IDC's Roger
Kay. ``If they doubled their market share as a result of this,
they'd still be a minor player.''
</P>
<P>
   Kay thinks that a burst of iMac sales will drive up Apple's
market share, but only for the time it takes for owners of older
Macintoshes to upgrade their systems. Once the loyal customer base
has been satisfied, he predicted that iMac sales will fall off. But
Kay added that there are enough loyal Mac users to allow Apple a
healthy profit from that market alone.
</P>
<P>
   Apple's stock, which traded below 13 last December, closed
Friday at 40 1/2, up 1 1/16, on Nasdaq.

HOT ITEMS: LONDON EDITION

   Modest in Silk
</P>
<P>
   Jemima Khan, daughter of the late financier Sir James Goldsmith,
shocked London society in 1995, when she forsook West End
nightclubs and a university career to marry Imran Khan, a former
captain of the Pakistani cricket team, and a Muslim. Followed by
the paparazzi, she toured poverty-stricken streets of Lahore in a
shalwar kameez, the Pakistani pajama-style pantsuit. Surprisingly,
the public deemed the look smashing.
</P>
<P>
   Now Ms. Khan is introducing a line of Western clothes inspired
by Pakistani dress: floor-length sequined cocktail dresses in heavy
woven fabrics; dyed silk brocade coat dresses, chiffon cardigan
wraps.
</P>
<P>
   Not all are as modest as Muslim law requires: Some dresses come
in shorter lengths and have halter necks. Ms. Khan said she wanted
``to design clothes that are sufficiently modest for me, but are
still feminine and smart.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cross and A la Mode, the boutiques that carry Jemima Khan,
sold out in a week, and the racks remain empty. ``The dresses are
made by hand in Pakistan, and each takes around three months to
complete,'' explained Ms. Khan, whose dresses cost about $975.
Proceeds go to a hospital founded by her husband.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Service
</P>
<P>
   Socialists with servants? These days, the 101 female members of
Parliament, known by the press as Blair's Babes, are as likely to
debate the abolition of the House of Lords as the rights and wrongs
of nanny-hiring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never used to have staff, but after my fourth baby I cracked
and employed an au pair and a cleaner,'' said Margaret Hodge, a
Labor member. ``Everyone lambasted me. You couldn't be a socialist
and have a maid. Now under New Labor, we're not so ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Shades of the pre-World War II era of the scullery maid,
housekeeper and butler, as in ``The Remains of the Day.'' According
to polls in the Spectator, British spending on domestic help has
doubled in the last decade. The boom is financed by the aspiring
middle class, working mothers who need help and young fogies who
fancy having a black-tie butler serve dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Newcomers to the upstairs-downstairs household should note that
butler etiquette must still be observed. Not to be confused with a
gentleman's gentleman, the butler faxes the office with a dinner
menu but does not polish your shoes.
</P>
<P>
   The Queen's New English
</P>
<P>
   Natural Spice: Nickname for Geri Halliwell (Ginger Spice), now
seen walking about bereft of makeup following her split with the
pop band.
</P>
<P>
   Henmania: Hysteria for Britain's Wimbledon hope, Tim Henman.
</P>
<P>
   TTH: Trying too hard. For instance, turning up in a shiny new
Barbour jacket.
</P>
<P>
   Happies: High asset professionals. Replacing yuppies, they are
more likely to invest in property than in Porsches.
</P>
<P>
   Tuerschlusspanik: German for the ``Bridget Jones' Diary''
syndrome of being single in your late 30s. Literally,
door-shut-panic.
</P>
<P>
   Glamouflage: The flashy gear needed to get into spots like the
Met Bar and look as if you belong.
</P>
<P>
   The New Insensitivity: Lack of charm in everyday behavior, like
asking the butler to shine your shoes.
</P>
<P>
   The Bloke Look
</P>
<P>
   Suiting up in London used to be simple: Bankers went to Savile
Row, salesclerks to Marks &AMP; Spencer. But newly image-conscious
young professionals want zippy suits with designer labels, like
John Rocha's boldly colored, luxuriously lined, close-cut models
(coming to Saks Fifth Avenue in New York in the fall).
</P>
<P>
   Owners are so attached to the new suits that they won't take
them off for any occasion. After Gordon Brown, the chancellor of
the Exchequer, eschewed white tie at a Mansion House dinner to
deliver his annual speech about the economy, men started wearing
suits instead of more formal attire to all kinds of upscale social
functions.
</P>
<P>
   At London weddings, it is now more chic to exchange the
traditional heavy black tailcoat for a tonic suit, in two-tone
linen or silk, made by Jigsaw, due to open a branch in New York in
the fall (prices start at $480).
</P>
<P>
   Snobbish hostesses are dismayed by the new sartorial
egalitarianism, and the mishmash of attire at their wedding
receptions. ``There is a backlash,'' said Marcus Ross, fashion
assistant at British GQ magazine. ``There's been a marked increase
in wedding invitations stipulating morning dress.'' Fashion's
dictates still can't compete with those of the mother of the bride.
</P>
<P>
   Carry On, Notting Hill
</P>
<P>
   What Richard Curtis did for the holy state of matrimony in
directing ``Four Weddings and a Funeral,'' he is about to do for
London's trendiest neighborhood with his newest film, ``Notting
Hill.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the comedy, starring Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant, won't
be released until next year, residents are already not amused. They
fear Curtis will satirize them all as louche 20-somethings, known
for their trust funds, drug-taking and love of rasta music.
</P>
<P>
   In real life, Notting Hill is home not only to trustafarians,
but also to fashionable figures like Jade Jagger, daughter of Mick
Jagger; Helen Fielding, author of ``Bridget Jones' Diary,'' and
Nicholas Coleridge, of Conde Nast U.K.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent hot spots of Notting Hill, once a small artisan
community, include the American restaurant Dakota (Madonna has
already had two parties there); the Tabernacle, which imported
Allegra McEvedy from New York's Tribeca Grill to be the head chef,
and the Pharmacie, owned by Sir Terence Conran.
</P>
<P>
   ``The anxiety is that the popularity of the film will attract
crowds, who will drive out all that is bohemian and eclectic and
replace it with money and the banal,'' said Philip Delves
Broughton, a Notting Hill homeowner. Will he see it? ``Of course.''

 &HT;    IN AN HISTORIC WHITE HOUSE SETTING, CLINTON WILL GIVE HIGH TECH
TESTIMONY
 &HT;    For release Sunday, August 16
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Seated in the room where generals briefed Franklin
Roosevelt on the allied invasion of Normandy and surrounded by
ornate furnishings that date to the beginnings of the republic,
President Clinton will answer prosecutors' questions on Monday
about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   He'll be aided by three lawyers and White House video equipment
that will feed his sworn testimony via closed circuit television
into a closed and windowless room at the U.S. district courthouse
several blocks away.
</P>
<P>
   There, for the first time in American history, a federal grand
jury will receive live testimony from a sitting president, who
planned to spend much of Saturday and Sunday rehearsing for
Monday's session.
</P>
<P>
   At 1 p.m., Clinton is scheduled to walk into the so-called Map
Room, which Roosevelt used as a situation room for military updates
on World War II campaigns, on the first floor of the White House
residence.
</P>
<P>
   There Clinton will be grilled, probably for several hours, by
representatives from the office of independent counsel Kenneth
Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Aides with Starr's office, the White House and lawyers familiar
with the arrangements all declined to say whether Starr would be
present for the testimony, or whether questions would be asked by
other prosecutors on his staff.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, Clinton's answers will be fed live to the 23-person
grand jury and videotaped for any jurors unable to view the
testimony as it unfolds. Jurors may submit questions to the
prosecutors, but they are under no obligation to put those
questions to Clinton. Jurors may not put questions directly to the
president.
</P>
<P>
   Since January, Starr has been investigating allegations that
Clinton had a White House affair with former intern Monica Lewinsky
and later urged her to lie about it under oath.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has denied the charges.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent grand jury appearance, however, Lewinsky reportedly
contradicted Clinton's version of events, outlining a long-term
White House affair.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials have said little about whether Clinton
intends to stick by his earlier denials or to amend his account.
Clinton's spokesman, Michael McCurry, told reporters Friday he
expected Clinton to respond fully and honestly to prosecutors'
questions.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know why he wouldn't. He's under oath. The truth is
the truth. He's got to testify and it's a consequential thing when
you go before a grand jury,'' McCurry said. ''But we don't know
what is going to be asked. We obviously don't know what's going to
be answered.''
</P>
<P>
   McCurry said he didn't know whether Clinton plans to address the
nation after his Monday testimony and that he probably wouldn't
know until Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is expected to leave shortly after his testimony to
begin a two-week vacation on Martha's Vineyard, off the
Massachusetts coast.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will sit beneath a cut-glass chandelier made in England
before the Revolutionary War, surrounded by 8th-Century Chippendale
chairs, desks and tables arrayed across a century-old Oriental rug.
</P>
<P>
   Hanging above a sandstone mantle is a map showing military
positions across Europe as U.S.-led Allied forces closed in on Nazi
Germany on April 3, 1945 _ nine days before Roosevelt died, and
five weeks before Germany surrendered.
</P>
<P>
   Technicians are going to pains to ensure that the closed-circuit
signal remains closed to potential hackers who might try to
intercept testimony expected to shed light on Clinton's
relationship with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Aides with Starr's office, the White House and Clinton's legal
team refused to discuss those arrangements. Experts say the most
likely possibility is that the signal could be sent through
existing White House fiber optic lines and routed to the
courthouse. Alternatively, if the signal is to be broadcast, it
could be scrambled in an attempt to prevent a high-tech hijacking
of the potentially explosive testimony. Experts say fiber optic
transmissions are more secure than those broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will be accompanied by no White House staff other than
White House Counsel Charles Ruff. Also present on Clinton's behalf
will be two of personal attorneys, David Kendall and Nicole
Seligman, both of the Washington law firm Williams &AMP; Connolly.
White House officials refused to say whether Clinton's lawyers can
advise him during the questioning.
</P>
<P>
   Normally witnesses appear before a grand jury alone. Even their
attorneys are required to wait outside of the grand jury room, as
part of efforts to ensure the secrecy of grand jury hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's office subpoenaed Clinton last month to appear before
the grand jury. Clinton agreed to testify on camera from the White
House, on the condition that Starr withdraw his subpoena.
</P>
<P>
   A grand jury does not determine a person's innocence or guilt,
but merely reviews testimony and evidence to determine whether a
prosecutor has a case with sufficient evidence to warrant a trial.

FLEET FINANCIAL TO IMPOSE 75-CENT ATM SURCHARGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICIA WEN AND BRUCE MOHL  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Fleet Financial Group Inc. said Friday it will impose a
75-cent surcharge for users of its automated teller machines who
are not customers of the bank.
</P>
<P>
   The surcharge, not unexpected, is lower than had been previously
projected.
</P>
<P>
   While battling consumer groups and lawmakers who wanted to ban
all surcharges, Fleet's officials have long talked about imposing
$1 ATM surcharge on non-customers. They cited the figure as the
amount they charge in other states where they operate and necessary
to cover costs.
</P>
<P>
   But Fleet spokeswoman Ellen Molle said the bank's new figure of
75 cents was a business decision based on the local economy, and
that $1 was never a set figure.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is based on what we thought the competitive marketplace
could bear,'' she said. ``We never said $1.''
</P>
<P>
   The surcharge plan, which has been filed with the state banking
commissioner, would take effect on Sept. 14.
</P>
<P>
   The state's other large bank, BankBoston, could not be reached
late Friday about its decisions regarding surcharges.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet's announcement comes as the 210-member Massachusetts
Bankers Association told the state attorney general's office Friday
that it was rescinding a plan it proposed last month, which set a
maximum $1 ATM surcharge for non-customers at the state's two
largest banks, Fleet and BankBoston.
</P>
<P>
   The plan was designed in part to mollify concerns among smaller
banks that the fees would cause their depositors to switch to the
big banks. In addition to the cap on fees, Fleet and BankBoston
also agreed not to run advertising or promotions encouraging
customers of other banks to switch to one of the two big banks to
avoid surcharges. The two banks also agreed to work out agremeents
with the smaller banks to allow them to pay the surcharge fee
directly, rather than have their customers assessed it while taking
money out of a BankBoston or Fleet ATM.
</P>
<P>
   The plan came under attack by the attorney general's office,
which raised anti-trust concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Forte, president of the trade group, said his group is
pulling back from the plan because it doesn't want to get into a
protracted legal battle with the attorney general's office.
</P>
<P>
   After consulting with the association's attorneys, Forte said,
the association decided ``we have to pull that plan off the
table.'' He emphasized that the association always viewed the plan
as a a set of ``voluntary best practices guidelines'' and not a
rigid price-setting deal between two big banks.
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston and Fleet own two-thirds of all ATM machines in
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Reacting to the announcement by Fleet, Attorney General Scott
Harshbarger reiterated his call for an ATM surcharge ban. He
described the charge as ``unfair to consumers and ``a threat to
community banks in the state.''
</P>
<P>
   He said ``it too soon to tell'' if the Massachusetts Bankers
Association's decision to pull back last month's plan satisfies his
anti-trust concerns. He said he has scheduled meetings with the
banks next week.

   CLINTON-NH-VOICES (Dover, N.H.) _ In 1992 Bill Clinton, his New

affairs and questions about his draft record, defied speculation
that he would have to drop out and instead, at the Elks hall here,
vowed to stick it out until ``the last dog dies.'' Friday, in that

   ECON-ASSESS (Undated) _ With Russia facing financial turmoil,
Asia sinking deeper into depression and President Clinton in a
political crisis, the blindingly bright economic picture of the
past couple of years suddenly looks murkier. What makes things a
bit scary is that the economy has now shifted into much slower
gear. And slowdowns _ which make it harder for businesses and
consumers to shrug off random blows _ have a way of turning into
recessions. By Sylvia Nasar.

<P>
   CLAYTON, Ga._ The real white water, the ``Deliverance white
water,'' is all downstream. But upstream, on the West Fork of the
Chattooga River near the intersection of Georgia, South Carolina
and North Carolina, the gently flowing shallows provide an ideal
training ground for paddlers who are not quite ready to navigate
Class V rapids and 7-foot falls.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the West Fork has provided a serene and unfettered
journey through the Chattahoochee National Forest. On one recent
brilliant afternoon, canoeists saw a great blue heron lift off a
driftwood perch and flap its way around the bend like a forward
scout. Skittish darters zigzagged just beneath the surface,
streaking away from the approaching bow. The smell of polecat
lingered on the banks.
</P>
<P>
   But things have not been very idyllic here since Earl Lovell,
Scottie Fain and Chris Henson bought the only major tract along the
West Fork that is not part of the national forest. Last August, the
three developers spent about $1.5 million to obtain 230 acres on
both sides of the river and announced plans to subdivide it for
high-end housing.
</P>
<P>
   They did not stop with their plan to sell lots starting at
$200,000. Although the Chattooga is designated by Congress as one
of 154 national wild and scenic rivers, the developers declared
that the one-mile stretch of the West Fork flowing through their
land was private property and could not be traversed without
permission.
</P>
<P>
   In enforcing their blockade, the developers played off the
imagery of ``Deliverance,'' the 1972 movie filmed on the Chattooga
in which four canoeists encounter serious trouble from two mountain
men on the riverbank.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, they hung a sign from a cable across the river
saying, ``Private Property _ Survivors Will Be Prosecuted.'' From
time to time, paddlers choosing to ignore the warning were
confronted by bands of men on the shore who strongly suggested that
they remove themselves from the river.
</P>
<P>
   ``When there are 10 big guys sitting there on the bank with
shovels, it can be a little intimidating,'' said Mark Lovell, who
is Earl Lovell's son. ``After all, this is the river where
`Deliverance' was filmed.'' One of the developers' lawyers, Jay
Bennett, noted with a chuckle that his clients once considered
hanging speakers from the trees so that trespassers could be
greeted with a recording of ``Dueling Banjos,'' the movie's twangy
theme song.
</P>
<P>
   Those accustomed to running the river are not amused. Buzz
Williams, a former river guide who now directs the Chattooga River
Watershed Coalition, said he had dissuaded a group of men from
carrying out a plan, hatched in a barroom, to send a flotilla of
armed paddlers down the West Fork. Perhaps even more menacing, a
group of trial lawyers volunteered to float through the property.
</P>
<P>
   Williams speculated that the developers may want to incite
public protest so that pressure will mount on the Forest Service to
buy the land at an exorbitant price. ``They're in it to make a huge
amount of money,'' he said of the developers. ``It's a form of
high-stakes leverage with a very important piece of property.''
</P>
<P>
   Lovell, a white-haired fireplug of a man whose voice rumbles
like a bulldozer, is not the least bit offended by Williams'
description. ``I strictly buy every piece of property to make a
profit,'' he said, explaining that the developers would gladly sell
for $4.6 million, a one-year turnaround of 207 percent. ``All
things being equal, I'd rather see the Forest Service get it, but I
ain't giving them no slack.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Although Williams and Lovell share a certain mutual admiration,
as well as the common goal of persuading the Forest Service to buy
the land, the two antagonists live in different worlds.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, 48, is a hippie-ish outdoorsman with the sinewed
deltoids of an expert paddler. He drives a battered pickup and
lives with his wife in a non-electrified mud hut modeled after a
Mongolian yurt.
</P>
<P>
   Lovell, 64, lives in a stunning hilltop house on a 700-acre
spread in nearby Clarkesville that boasts a 360-degree view of the
surrounding Appalachians. He is regarded as a savvy businessman who
is known for coarse language. In an interview, he went out of his
way to volunteer that he uses a racial epithet when referring to
black people.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, most folks around here have never appreciated James
Dickey's characterization in ``Deliverance,'' which depicted the
locals as toothless, tourist-raping hillbillies. But the movie's
thrilling scenes of whitewater canoeing gave birth to a new
outfitting industry in northeast Georgia that brings about 75,000
rafters and paddlers to the Chattooga each year.
</P>
<P>
   In May, the Justice Department used the commerce generated by
the outfitters as the foundation of a federal lawsuit that seeks to
declare the West Fork as a navigable waterway. Under the U.S.
Constitution, navigable rivers are public property. Case law has
established that a river's navigability depends on its capacity for
commercial transport, but a judge must decide whether whitewater
outfitting fits that definition.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Cassidy, general counsel for American Rivers, a national
conservation group, said that courts have applied different
definitions in different cases. But, he asserted, ``when Congress
designated these as wild and scenic rivers it intended that members
of the public would have a right to boat on them.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett, the lawyer for the developers, countered that canoes
and kayaks are not customary vehicles for trade. ``But the main
point,'' he said, ``is that what the government wants to do, which
is to avoid development up there, they can only do by paying us the
fair value.''
</P>
<P>
   At a hearing in June, the Forest Service and the developers
agreed to try to negotiate a purchase price. While talks are
ongoing, the developers have removed the sign over the river and
stopped confronting paddlers as they cross the property.
</P>
<P>
   But if hostilities resume, Williams may press the Forest Service
to condemn part of the shoreline for a scenic easement, which would
insure access to the river. He acknowledged that doing so would be
unpopular here in Rabun County, where private property rights are
considered sacred because the government already owns 63 percent of
the land.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a hornet's nest,'' Williams said. ``But if they
push us to the wall, we'll play every card we have.''

CHAOS ASIDE, IRVIN STILL KING OF CHARM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ She was blond-haired and blue-eyed and
was pressed up against the chain-link fence, her head about level
with the knees of the adults around her, who were straining to get
Michael Irvin's autograph.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving the lunchroom at training camp the other day, Irvin had
strolled over to the fence to sign for the folks patiently waiting.
No way he could ignore the little blond-haired beauty as she twined
her 3-year-old fingers through the fence.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are so cute,'' Irvin told her as he knelt to squeeze her
hand. ``Do you know how cute you are?''
</P>
<P>
   The little girl's cheeks dimpled as she flashed a heartbreaker's
smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' she said simply.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin burst into laughter as he stood up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids are so great,'' he said, ``because they're never afraid
of the truth. Why is it, when we get to be adults, we feel we have
to lie?''
</P>
<P>
   It was a rhetorical question and the dozen or so Cowboys fans,
happy to have the team's famed wide receiver so near, smiled and
shook their heads.
</P>
<P>
   But the question hung there in the early afternoon heat, begging
an answer.
</P>
<P>
   Why indeed?
</P>
<P>
   I was hanging around to ask Irvin _ again _ to sit down for an
interview. It was my fifth request since training camp began, the
second time that day.
</P>
<P>
   It still hasn't happened and probably won't, but you never know.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in camp I had endured two brushoffs and an official
stiffing from Irvin. That's how those in my business rate our
nonproductive interview attempts.
</P>
<P>
   It works like this: You approach a player as he's leaving the
practice field, or entering the cafeteria, and politely ask if he'd
mind giving you a few minutes after lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Most are amenable. Irvin, for obvious reasons, can be tough to
pin down.
</P>
<P>
   A brushoff is when they say they don't have time, maybe
tomorrow, that kind of thing. When the player acquiesces, you set a
time and when they don't show or offer up some other sudden excuse
why they can't stay for the interview, you've been officially
stiffed.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of weeks ago Irvin agreed, finally, to sit down after
lunch and a national TV interview he had promised to do. I waited,
biding my time and thinking of what questions to ask. But when he'd
completed his TV deal, he blew by with a weak apology about an
appointment he had to keep.
</P>
<P>
   Something about a haircut, I think.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't hide my disgust well, hoping to make Michael feel as
guilty as possible.
</P>
<P>
   That guilt was what I was playing on when I made my fourth and
fifth runs at him the other day.
</P>
<P>
   Understand, I like Michael Irvin. I can't help it. He makes me
laugh.
</P>
<P>
   I don't like some of the things he has done, but it's difficult
to spend any time around him and not be charmed. He's personable,
fun, direct and highly quotable, an asset not to be undervalued
when you're a reporter looking for a story. Plus, he truly enjoys
talking.
</P>
<P>
   He also can't seem to stay out of trouble, explaining his most
recent reticence about facing a notebook or tape recorder. Thus,
you won't be reading any Irvin quotes here.
</P>
<P>
   We spent a good bit of time just talking, Irvin being careful
not to reveal too much, me trying to tiptoe around taboo subjects
and still understand what's going on in his head.
</P>
<P>
   No juicy revelations about what happened in that dorm room with
Everett McIver. No finger-pointing. No alibis. No concocted
stories.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what I can tell you:
</P>
<P>
   Somebody other than the Cowboys _ perhaps his probation officer
_ has instructed Irvin to keep quiet on the McIver incident until
all investigations have been completed.
</P>
<P>
   He is livid at reports he was involved in a payoff to McIver.
</P>
<P>
   He remains convinced that, at heart, he is a good, if imperfect,
human being, who very much believes that he can be a productive
player for the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys keep saying nobody's going to jail, everything's
fine, the situation has been handled internally and it's no longer
an issue.
</P>
<P>
   I'd still like to hear the whole story, on the record, from
Michael's own lips someday.
</P>
<P>
   And even though we're all adults here, I won't even insist on a
polygraph machine.

FDA CAN'T REGULATE TOBACCO, APPEALS COURT RULES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Cigarette makers won a major victory Friday, as a
federal appeals court blocked President Clinton's landmark effort
to regulate tobacco sales and marketing, particularly to children.
</P>
<P>
   Reversing a lower court finding, a three-judge panel in the US
Fourth Circuit of Appeals ruled 2-1 that the Food and Drug
Administration has no authority to regulate tobacco, as Clinton
ordered the agency to do in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, issued less than a month after a move to further
regulate cigarette makers died in the Senate, sets up a likely
Supreme Court showdown over Clinton's high-stakes effort to crack
down on the $50 billion tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling strengthens the hand of tobacco companies in their
negotiations to settle smoking-related lawsuits by about three
dozen states. The decision also is expected to renew the push for
congressional action.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is that Congress did not equip the FDA with tools
appropriate for the regulation of tobacco because it had no
intention that the (Food, Drug,and Cosmetics) Act apply to tobacco
products,'' the appeals court ruled in a majority opinion written
by US Circuit Judge H. Emory Widener Jr.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration immediately vowed to challenge the
ruling, first by petitioning the full appeals court to reconsider
its decision.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton ``is fully committed to the FDA's regulatory role and
its role in protecting our children,'' said White House spokesman
Michael McCurry. ``Reaffirming the Food and Drug Administration's
authority over tobacco products is necessary to help stop young
people from smoking.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision, if upheld, would strike down the FDA regulations
currently in effect, including a requirement that stores demand
proof of age for anyone under age 27 who attempts to buy
cigarettes. The legal age to buy cigarettes in all 50 states is 18.
</P>
<P>
   The other FDA regulations at issue are rules limiting
vending-machine sales and outdoor advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-tobacco advocates expressed outrage at the ruling, although
many said they expected a setback because the appeals court is
based in Richmond, Va., deep in tobacco country.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is simply a way station on the road to the US Supreme
Court,'' said Richard Daynard, director of the Tobacco Products
Liability Project at Northeastern University.
</P>
<P>
   Still, William D. Novelli, president of the Campaign for
Tobacco-Free Kids, decried the decision as ``a victory for Big
Tobacco's lawyers over America's families and their children.''
</P>
<P>
   Widener, who was appointed to the bench by President Nixon, was
joined in the ruling by Senior US District Judge James H. Michael
Jr., an appointee of President Carter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not dispute in this case that Congress has charged the
FDA with protecting the public health and that tobacco products
present serious health risks for the public,'' Widener wrote.
</P>
<P>
   But Widener and Michael concluded that the FDA regulations on
tobacco exceeded the agency's authority.
</P>
<P>
   The lone dissenter was Senior US Circuit Judge Kenneth K. Hall,
an appointee of President Ford, whose opinion is expected to figure
prominently in a likely Supreme Court appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inasmuch as cigarettes and smokeless tobacco are responsible
for illness and death on a vast scale,'' Hall wrote, ``FDA
regulations aimed at curbing tobacco use by children cannot
possibly be contrary to the general intent of the (Food, Drug, and
Cosmetics Act) to protect the public health.''
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court reversed a decision last year by US District
Judge William Osteen in North Carolina, who upheld the FDA rules
under the agency's finding that nicotine should be regulated as a
drug and tobacco products as drug-delivery devices. Even that
decision, however, rejected government restrictions on tobacco
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's decision was welcomed by the nation's five largest
tobacco companies that appealed the lower court decision: Philip
Morris, R.J. Reynolds, Brown &AMP; Williamson, Lorillard and U.S.
Tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   The industry was joined in the appeal by convenience store
retailers and advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are pleased by the court's ruling that the FDA does not
have authority to regulate tobacco products, and that the agency's
1996 tobacco rule is invalid,'' the cigarette companies said in a
joint statement. ``The industry remains fully committed to taking
meaningful steps to reduce underage tobacco use.''
</P>
<P>
   Several leading anti-tobacco advocates in Congress criticized
the court's ruling. ``I believe the FDA has ample authority under
current law to regulate tobacco to protect the public health, and
I'm optimistic the Supreme Court will revisit it,'' said Senator
Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts. ``The FDA's role is
especially important in protecting children from the cynical
advertising assaults of the tobacco industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Senator John McCain, an Arizona Republican who led the
unsuccessful push for anti-tobacco legislation in the Senate, said,
``The appeals court's decision makes it even more imperative that
Congress pass legislation to address the problem of youth tobacco
use and addiction.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys general in nearly 40 states had filed briefs with the
appeals court supporting the FDA regulations. Several expressed
disappointment at the decision, which gives the tobacco industry
fresh momentum as it fights numerous lawsuits from states trying to
recover billions of dollars in medical costs for smoking-related
illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless the Supreme Court imposes some common sense,'' said
Massachusetts Attorney General Scott Harshbarger, ``tough action by
Congress is our last hope.''
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court ruling does not affect state and local laws
governing tobacco sales, use or marketing.

   GORTON-MICROSOFT (Washington) Sen. Slade Gorton's advocacy for
Microsoft is being rewarded with campaign contributions from
company executives. During the first six months of this year, 23
Microsoft executives have contributed to Gorton, even though the
state's 70-year-old senior senator isn't currently a candidate for
anything and hasn't announced whether he plans to seek re-election
in 2000. The contributions are far more numerous than ever received
by Gorton from the Redmond-based software giant. In 1997, he
received contributions from eight Microsoft executives, in 1996
none, and in 1995 he received just one contribution, from the
company chairman and chief executive officer, Bill Gates.

 &HT;    This time, increase might stick as American boost is matched
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ An on-again, off-again effort by big airlines to boost
certain advance purchase airfares may finally take hold, resulting
in a 4 percent increase for some travelers.
</P>
<P>
   American Airlines initiated the increase, and on Friday
Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines, along with United, Continental and
US Airways, matched the move.
</P>
<P>
   The increase affects many, but not all, advance purchase prices.
For instance, from Atlanta a 14-day roundtrip fare to Washington's
Reagan National Airport rises to $380 from $365, while a 21-day
fare to Denver moves to $441 from $424.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines have tried to quietly boost such fares no fewer than
six times dating back to the spring, according to analyst Sam
Buttrick of PaineWebber.
</P>
<P>
   Delta initiated a similar boost last week. But like the previous
hikes, it was rescinded when Northwest Airlines did not go along.
The apparent reason, Buttrick said, was that Northwest has been
plagued with service and labor woes, and did not want to risk
further alienating loyal customers.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines can't legally agree to raise fares as a group, but
typically don't stick with an increase unless rivals go along.
</P>
<P>
   This time, American exempted flights into Northwest hubs _
Minneapolis, Detroit and Memphis _ and Delta did likewise. The move
was seen as an offer to mitigate the effect on Northwest, but
unless Northwest matches the boost in other cities it could still
fall apart.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the increase won't affect sale fares or the lowest
advance purchase fares in markets where Delta competes with
discounters such as AirTran.
</P>
<P>
   And it doesn't affect walk-up fares or those requiring no
weekend stay, which are most often used by business fliers. Those
fares have risen more sharply over the past year than advance
purchase fares, which have been relatively stable.

PROBATION OFFICIALS TALK WITH COWBOYS' McIVER, IRVIN 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By MEDE NIX 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dallas County adult probation officials have talked with Cowboys
guard Everett McIver about a July 29 incident at training camp that
left him with a cut on his neck, said Ron Goethals, director of
Dallas County's community supervision and corrections department.
</P>
<P>
   The interview took place at Cowboys training camp in Wichita
Falls when, Goethals said yesterday, probation officials also
talked with Michael Irvin. A source with knowledge of the situation
said that Irvin was involved in the dormitory-room incident in
which McIver was cut with a scissors.
</P>
<P>
   Goethals said he would not comment about what was said by
McIver, or ``several'' other people probation officials spoke with.
</P>
<P>
   McIver was unavailable for comment. Cowboys owners Jerry Jones
said the investigation ``has not interrupted any player from
practice or interfered with anything we have done during training
camp.''
</P>
<P>
   Previously, Goethals had said probation officials would not
investigate the incident unless a complaint of criminal action was
filed. But the McIver interview came during the normal course of
business, which ``you can assume'' was to talk to Michael Irvin,
Goethals said.
</P>
<P>
   Goethals said officials from his office are in contact with
Irvin regularly according to the terms of his probation.
</P>
<P>
   However, he said that the interviews of McIver and others is not
a change in the stance of the probation department regarding the
incident.
</P>
<P>
   The interviews may not necessarily lead to a decision to file a
report with District Judge Manny Alvarez, who sentenced Irvin to
four years' probation in 1996 after Irving pleaded guilty to
possession of cocaine, Goethals said. Alvarez can revoke Irvin's
probation and sentence him to two to 20 years in prison if he finds
Irvin has violated his probation.
</P>
<P>
   Goethals maintains that the usual threshold to seek revocation
of probation would be the filing of a criminal complaint _ which
would indicate some evidence of a crime _ and not merely reports of
what might be considered a criminal incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is still a matter pending before the court, and we are
acting as the eyes and ears of the judge,'' Goethals said.
</P>
<P>
   The interviews with people about the incident is not in response
to publicity surrounding the incident or a change in the way the
probation department is handling the case, Goethals said.
</P>
<P>
   A probation officer would normally make arrangements to talk
with or visit a probationer who is going to be out of the county
for an extended period of time, like at a training camp in Wichita
Falls.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the normal scheme of things,'' he said. ``And in the
course of that arrangement, (probation officers) might talk to
other people.''
</P>
<P>
   Goethals said he did not know if probation officers actually
visited Irvin at the Cowboys' training camp last year when it was
in Austin or merely made arrangements to talk with Irvin by phone.

SEEDS AT COREL BEING BLOWN AWAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WELLESLEY, Mass. _ The seeds have fallen by the wayside, blown
by an ill wind into the dry ditches, so now the question for the
Corel Boston Cup is this: Can flowers still bloom on the tennis
court without seeds?
</P>
<P>
   Fourth seed Silvia Farina departed Thursday, and Friday top seed
Amanda Coetzer and No. 2 Anke Huber were double-dutched, leaving
only No. 3 Lisa Raymond with a chance to sprout.
</P>
<P>
   Coetzer lost to Barbara Schett, 6-7 (7-3), 6-4, 6-2, while Huber
fell to Mariaan de Swardt, 6-3, 7-6 (7-5), in the quarterfinals at
Babson College. Raymond beat Corina Morariu, 7-6 (7-5), 6-2, and
will meet de Swardt in Saturday's first semifinal at noon.
</P>
<P>
   All fine and good, say Schett and de Swardt, the
seed-scrunchers, because they feel their time is coming. Especially
Schett, the 22-year-old Austrian from Innsbruck who time and again
has found herself with chances in the third set to knock off the
top women in the world ... only to fail. The 29th-ranked woman in
the world has the litany of missed chances learned by rote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Against (Jana) Novotna, I was 5-4 and 40-love in the third
set, and then I had (Arantxa) Sanchez (Vicario), 5-2, in the third
set ... always against Top 10 players,'' said the 5-foot-10-inch
Schett. ``It was in Berlin this year, Novotna and Sanchez was in
Berlin, too ... always in Berlin. Then against (Monica) Seles, I
had six match points once ... two years ago in Madrid ... and I
lost that, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday Schett led, 5-3, in the first set with her serve against
Coetzer, the eighth-ranked player in the world, only to let the
South African crawl back. At 6-5, Schett had the advantage over
Coetzer but once again let the South African off the hook, and
Coetzer drew level at 6-6 and won the tiebreaker by acing Schett
for the final point.
</P>
<P>
   Schett's memory bank now kicked into some very grim selective
recall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd been leading, 5-3, with my serve and I was thinking it
happens very often to me against Top 10 players,'' she said. ``So I
was thinking, `Come on. Not again. I do not want to lose again.'''
</P>
<P>
   The two women held serve through the first four games of the
second set. Then a marathon fifth game, lasting nearly 15 minutes,
tested the wills and bodies and psyche of Schett and Coetzer, who
was serving. Coetzer fell behind, 0-40, but battled back even and
five times wouldn't relent as Schett had the advantage. On her
sixth tango with fate, Coetzer couldn't bring the game back to
deuce as she double-faulted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could see that mentally, she was a little ... ah, broken ...
after that game,'' said Schett. ``Then she was serving really bad.
The problem was that I hadn't been aggressive enough with her
serves. I think her second serve is not so hard, and I could step
in and be aggressive, but that's what I didn't do (until that fifth
game). But then I was aggressive and I made the breaks ... or she
double-faulted.''
</P>
<P>
   Coetzer would win only three more games the rest of the match.
But with that memory bank in the grim mode, Schett could enjoy
little of it, even when she was up, 3-0, in the final set.
</P>
<P>
   First, said Schett, ``Amanda never gives up and always fights to
the last point. Amanda doesn't make any presents to her opponent.
You almost have to beat her twice, I would say.''
</P>
<P>
   When Coetzer broke her in the fourth game of the final set,
Schett felt that old Novotna-Seles-Sanchez Vicario scenario
creeping back into play, even though her groundstrokes were
blazing.
</P>
<P>
   ``When she broke me at 3-love, I was getting a little nervous
again,'' said Schett. ``That's because ... you know, I was leading
very often against those (top) players and I not win. And you know,
in the mind, you always think about that a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   But Schett cruised home, and it was Coetzer who was left
mystified by the turn of events. The South African conceded she was
``sluggish'' and ``I never really ever felt comfortable'' and ``I
really struggled with my returns, Fridayand that was very
disappointing.''
</P>
<P>
   There comes a game every match that is as much a test of wills
as bodies, and Coetzer conceded that losing that fifth game of the
second set ``was definitely the crucial point.''
</P>
<P>
   What was surprising to fitness freak Coetzer ``was that I didn't
feel very energetic or motivated at that point, and I don't often
feel like that. It was very hard for me not to get through that
game _ I really had a lot of opportunities in it _ and it was the
turning point.''

 &HT;    Retirement date moved up for Delta's oldest jets
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Delta Air Lines will accelerate the retirement of its
oldest jets, prodded in part by more stringent requirements for
maintaining aging aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based airline said the move, which involves its
Boeing 727s, will help check a gradual rise in average fleet age
and improve customer service by boosting reliability.
</P>
<P>
   Delta has 131 of the jets _ more than any single type in its
fleet _ and said it plans to retire them all by 2005, rather than
2008 as previously planned.
</P>
<P>
   Delta spokeswoman Laura Gillig said one reason for the move is a
recent change in Federal Aviation Administration rules that results
in more frequent mandatory inspections for some 727s. She said
Delta and other airlines that fly the 727 face significantly higher
costs over the long run if they keep the jet in their fleets.
</P>
<P>
   The planes will be replaced primarily by a new version of the
737, another '60s-era workhorse now being produced in updated
models. The replacement should help Delta pare operating costs. The
727 has three engines and requires three pilots, while the 737 has
only two of each.
</P>
<P>
   The first of the new 737s arrives this fall, when the 727
retirements will begin. Gillig said deliveries of 737s will be
stepped up in coming years to match the accelerated retirement
plan.
</P>
<P>
   Delta's 727s average 21.6 years in age, ranking them just ahead
of the next-oldest jet in the fleet, the L-1011 TriStar, at 19.4
years. The L-1011s are slated for replacement by an extended
version of the 767 widebody slated for initial delivery in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The average age of Delta's 570-jet fleet has crept upward in
recent years, from 9.6 years in 1993 to 12.4 years currently _
about in the middle of the industry pack.
</P>
<P>
   Separately on Friday, Delta said it will begin new service
between Portland, Ore., and Fukuoka, Japan, on Oct. 29. But it has
delayed the start of new Portland-Osaka flights until June 1999.
The flights are the result of a new treaty allowing more carriers
to add flights between the United States and Japan.

 &HT;    Braves on deck: Los Angeles Dodgers
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When: 4:05 p.m. EDT
</P>
<P>
   Where: Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   TV: FOX.
</P>
<P>
   Probable starting pitchers: RHP John Smoltz (10-2, 3.36; 13-11,
2.85 lifetime vs. Dodgers) vs. RHP Chan Ho Park (10-6, 3.90; 2-0,
3.86 lifetime vs. Braves).
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Last time out, Smoltz was hit as hard as he has been all
year, giving up six hits and five runs _ two of them Barry Bonds
homers _ on Sunday in San Francisco. Until then, he had been superb
during seven-straight starts _ 12 earned runs allowed in 46 innings
_ while going 5-0. Despite the worries about his right elbow,
Smoltz has struck out 70 batters in his 66 2/3 innings since coming
back from the DL on June 20. His 8.9 strikeouts per nine innings
would rank fourth in the league if Smoltz had pitched enough
innings to qualify. He has not faced the Dodgers this year but was
2-1 against them last season. He is 6-7 lifetime at Dodger Stadium.
Park, 25, had gone seven weeks without a loss until his last
outing, when he allowed two runs to Pittsburgh in a 2-1 loss. With
Ramon Martinez out, he has emerged as the ace of the staff,
although he has yet to throw a complete game this season. His ERA
is somewhat high, but it has been on a steady decline since
cresting at 5.36 in late June. Park rattled off 48 innings while
allowing just seven earned runs and going 5-0 during that period.

 &HT;    Profile on Alabama: Tide's DuBose confident in new aides
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUSCALOOSA, Ala. _ By his own admission, Mike DuBose made a ton
of mistakes in his first season as Alabama's head football coach.
And they all, he said, stemmed from one nearly fatal flaw.
</P>
<P>
   ``I assumed way too much,'' said DuBose, whose 4-7 record in
1997 was Alabama's worst since 1957, the year before Bear Bryant
took over.
</P>
<P>
   DuBose assumed that all his assistant coaches would be like him
when it came to the intensity and the work ethic they brought to
the job. He assumed that they believed in team goals first and
individual glory last. He assumed that they were all automatically
loyal to him as head coach. Not so.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was an assistant coach, I wanted to know more about my
position and my responsibility than anybody in the country. I
assumed the staff felt the same way,'' he said. ``That was a
mistake. Some people had different agendas.''
</P>
<P>
   DuBose won't discuss the specific problems that plagued his 1997
coaching staff, but those close to the program talk about an
incendiary mix of the old and the new. The old ones were holdovers
from the staff of Gene Stallings, who were wedded to the
traditional, conservative style of Alabama football. Can't blame
them _ Stallings won 70 games in seven years in Tuscaloosa.
</P>
<P>
   The new one were DuBose's own hires, brought in to help
implement his vision of what Alabama football should be in the next
century _ a sophisticated passing game to set up the running game,
after the manner of Tennessee and Florida.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take long for the sparks to fly. After rolling up more
passing yards (253) than running yards (240) in a 42-17 win against
Houston, Alabama was held to just 238 total yards (97 rushing) in a
20-0 win over Vanderbilt.
</P>
<P>
   Vanderbilt, as it turned out, had the SEC's best defense. But
the holdovers from the Stallings era saw it as evidence that the
passing philosophy was doomed to failure and were very vocal about
it in the staff meetings.
</P>
<P>
   DuBose listened and eventually gave in to that point of view. It
was, he said, the most serious mistake he made as a first-year
coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I let it influence my decision-making process, and we reverted
back to the style of football we played in the past, and that's not
what I wanted to do,'' DuBose said. ``It was the wrong thing to do.
It was a mistake, but that's a mistake I'll never make again.''
</P>
<P>
   From then on, the Alabama offense was caught in a competitive
twilight zone. Opponents began to throw up eight-man defensive
fronts to stop the run, knowing that the Crimson Tide didn't have
enough confidence to pass their way out of it.
</P>
<P>
   In seven of Alabama's last 10 games, the Crimson Tide was held
to less than 300 yards of total offense. It lost five of those
games and with each loss, the tension on the staff grew. Even the
players were aware of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We definitely saw the turmoil, and it had some effect on us,''
cornerback Fernando Bryant said.
</P>
<P>
   The problems culminated in the final game with Auburn. With less
than a minute left, Alabama had the ball with a 17-15 lead. The
Crimson Tide faced a third and eight at its own 36-yard line.
DuBose walked down the sideline to make sure the punt team was
getting ready, assuming offensive coordinator Bruce Arians would
call a safe running play.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Arians called a screen pass to fullback Ed Scissum, who
fumbled after a jarring hit by Auburn's Martavious Houston. Auburn
recovered at the Alabama 33-yard line and with 15 seconds left,
Jaret Holmes kicked a 39-yard field goal to give the Tigers a
crushing 18-17 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Afterwards, DuBose grappled for an explanation. Either he knew
about the call and gave his approval, or he didn't know about the
call in this most critical of situations. DuBose had assumed Arians
knew what he wanted at that point in the game, and it had cost him
dearly.
</P>
<P>
   The changes came swiftly. Arians was fired, and offensive-line
coach Neil Callaway was moved to offensive coordinator. Callaway is
Dubose's former teammate and roomate. They are friends who have
shared the same philosophy for more than 20 years. DuBose can
communicate better with Callaway and will trust his judgment with
the game on the line. ``Bruce (Arians) needed for me to be more
involved, and with Neil, he'll know what I want in those
situations,'' DuBose said. ``If he doesn't know it, I will tell him
at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Three other assistants _ Woody McCorvey, Danny Pearman, and
Curley Hallman _ went out the door with Arians. In their places,
DuBose hired four men he thinks will address the major weaknesses
in the program:
</P>
<P>
   _ Charlie Stubbs, who learned the passing game at BYU, became
quarterbacks coach. Last season as offensive coordinator at UNLV,
Stubbs took a freshman quarterback, Jon Denton, and led the WAC in
passing (2,586 yards). Denton also led the WAC in total offense
(287.9 ypg). It is hoped that Stubbs can work the same magic with
Tyler Watts, Alabama's highly touted freshman.
</P>
<P>
   Stubbs, who also was assistant head coach at UNLV, was willing
to come to Alabama despite the fact that Callaway has the title of
coordinator and will call the plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have much of an ego,'' Stubbs said. ``I just wanted to
work with and against the best.''
</P>
<P>
   _ DuBose lured Ronnie Cottrell away from Florida State by making
him assistant head coach. Since 1990, Cottrell had earned a
national reputation as the Seminoles' recruiting coordinator,
putting together one nationally ranked class after another.
</P>
<P>
   ``He brings a work ethic to the recruiting process that didn't
exist here before,'' DuBose said.
</P>
<P>
   The move already has paid off, as Alabama's incoming class is
rated in the top five by every major recruiting service.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we did at Florida State, we can do here,'' said Cottrell,
a native of Brewton, Ala., who played at Troy State. ``We just have
to broaden our horizons and work at it every single day.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Charlie Harbison, a former defensive backs coach at Clemson,
and Jackie Shipp, a former All-Big Eight defensive lineman from
Oklahoma, ``give us a spark we haven't had on that side of the
ball,'' DuBose said.
</P>
<P>
   So, all the pieces of the new organization are in place. DuBose
has surrounded himself with a group of men who share his vision and
can be counted on to remain loyal when the times get tough. And
yes, Alabama will have some tough times this season. Perhaps as
many as last season. But DuBose won't have to spend any time
looking over his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel really good about this staff. There are not a lot of
egos,'' he said. ``They have goals and ambitions, but no hidden
agendas. And that's good.''

 &HT;    NASCAR Notebook: Spencer taking time off after injuries
 &HT;    By Tom McCollister
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLYN, Mich. _ Jimmy Spencer begins a two-week medical
absence today from the Winston Cup circuit because of recurring
headaches resulting from injuries suffered when he hit the wall two
weeks ago at Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still bothering me a little bit, but what helped me make
the decision was my family, my kids,'' Spencer said. ``My wife
didn't say anything either way, but my kids said, 'Daddy, maybe you
better heal up before you race again.''
</P>
<P>
   Spencer is taking no chances, saying he's willing to sit out the
rest of the season if necessary, and his sponsor, Winston, has
assured him he has a ride next year even if he doesn't drive again
this year.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, says Spencer, is in making decisions running lap
after lap. He found himself last week questioning simple decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``In that situation, I think your blood pressure goes us, the
heat in the car goes up, and I think everything starts to play on
your mind,'' Spencer said. ''' don't want to jeopardize any of my
competitors, and I sure don't want to jeopardize Travis (Carter)
and this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Laton improved
</P>
<P>
   Gary Laton has been upgraded from critical to fair condition
after his crash during Busch Grand National qualifying Thursday. He
was alert and orientated and was able to move his arms and legs and
talk to his family.
</P>
<P>
   Busch doings
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Grubb led second Busch qualifying with a speed of 176.289
mph. Buckshot Jones starts 35th on his qualifying effort of 174.474
mph. Provisionals went to Tim Fedewa, Ed Berrier, Shane Hall, Jeff
Grogh, Ashton Lewis, Blaise Alexander and Dave Rezendes.
</P>
<P>
   Purvis loses
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Jeff Purvis should have kept his mouth shut after all.
NASCAR Commissioner Charles Stang upheld the fines and suspensions
imposed on Purvis, increasing the original fine from $5,000 to
$10,000, and upheld the four-race suspension and season-long
probation. The penalties were imposed against Purvis for an
altercation on pit road during the running of the Lycos 300 at
South Boston Speedway on July 25. His suspension began in
Indianapolis and will conclude in Darlington.
</P>
<P>
   Did you know?
</P>
<P>
   Although Hendrick Motorsports drivers Jeff Gordon and Terry
Labonte have won the last three Winston Cup championships, neither
driver has won a Winston Cup race at Michigan. . . . The last five
Winston Cup champions have led in points after the 20th race of the
season. Jeff Gordon, winner of last week's Bud at the Glen, is the
'98 Winston Cup points leader after 20 races . . . . Rusty Wallace
celebrated his 42nd birthday Friday.

STUDENT FROM N.H., FIVE OTHERS, RELEASED BY BURMA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARCELLA BOMBARDIERI  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTSMOUTH, N.H. _ Her brother is used to seeing her get
whatever she wants. Her mother is proud, but plans to ``have a talk
with her'' about the dangers of her global activism. Her father is
just amused that she is now ``a convicted seditionist.''
</P>
<P>
   Anjanette Hamilton was sentenced by a Burmese court to five
years hard labor Friday after handing out pro-democracy leaflets in
the Southeast Asian nation recently. But she and the five Americans
with her were deported instead, and are now en route to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The 20-year-old college student has long been driven to help the
less fortunate of the world, friends and family told the Globe. She
once raised $6,000 for an orphanage in India, where she spent a
year while in high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't know her that well, she's really shy and quiet,
but she comes home and she's a real tiger,'' said her 18-year-old
brother, Matt. ``She gets whatever she wants.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton, known as Angie, began her travel and humanitarian
activities with a high school exchange program in India. But her
goodheartedness goes back much further.
</P>
<P>
   Hanging in the Hamiltons' kitchen is a framed painting, in which
a wide-eyed child sits precariously on the edge of a hospital bed,
wrapped in a blanket emblazoned with the Red Cross symbol. Hamilton
painted the image as a school art project at the age of 12 or 13.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other kids just painted fruit bowls,'' said lifelong friend
Jessica Dominguez, 19, of York, Maine. ``She did people from other
cultures.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton, about to start her sophomore year at American
University in Washington, D.C., worked during school and all summer
to raise the money for her trip to Southeast Asia. She told her
family that she would be bringing medical supplies to refugee camps
in Thailand near the Burmese border.
</P>
<P>
   She did more than that, however. She and 17 companions from six
Asian and Western nations were detained for distributing leaflets
on the 10th anniversary of a national uprising against the Burmese
military regime, a movement that left 3,000 dead in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``She assured us that she had no intention of going to Burma,''
said her mother, Alison. ``Maybe it was an unplanned thing. Even if
it wasn't, she certainly wasn't going to tell us that.''
</P>
<P>
   Called a soft-spoken and intelligent young women, Hamilton had
never before worried her family.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last few days, she's made up for all the years she
didn't give us any worry, which I will tell her when I see her,''
her mother said. ``We're not mad at her, but we'll have a lot of
talks after this incident.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hamilton's Portsmouth home Friday buzzed with the excited
voices of friends celebrating Angie's imminent return. They spoke
in awe of her courage, humility, and commitment to international
relief efforts.
</P>
<P>
   After a year spent in India, Hamilton organized students and ran
car washes, ultimately raising $6,000 for an Indian orphanage. Ever
modest, she did not even tell friends when she received a Rotary
Club honor for her efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's really nonchalant, and even when she's in the paper you
don't hear about it from her,'' said friend Jordan Cocchiaro, 19,
of Portsmouth. ``This summer, she was just like, `Oh, by the way, I
bought a ticket to Thailand.'''
</P>
<P>
   According to her mother, Hamilton's belief in the power of the
individual was bolstered by her stay in Brazil last summer, where
she built latrines for families in a remote village.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was just one little person, but she came home feeling she
really had made an impact,'' Alison Hamilton said.
</P>
<P>
   She also learned the flexibility necessary to live in the
developing world. A health enthusiast who jogs and previously kept
to a vegetarian diet, she began eating some meat in order not to
violate social customs.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Brazil, her host father butchered a cow in the garage every
single week,'' her mother said. ``She learned to look out the
window and say, `There's the cow of the week.'''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton's mother credits her daughter's global interests to
years of voracious reading. In elementary school, Hamilton had to
be pried away from her books and forced onto the playground.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the books have opened up this whole world to her,''
her mother said. ``When you read about a far-off land, it comes
alive to you and you want to go see what it's about.''
</P>
<P>
   Though concerned about their daughter during the five-day
detention, Alison Hamilton, a sixth grade teacher, and husband
William Hamilton, a retired engineer, were comforted by word that
an embassy official had brought books to Angie in jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said she was reading two books a day,'' the mother said.
``We knew that if she had books, she was at least happy.''
</P>
<P>
   At American, Hamilton is majoring in anthropology and
international development. It was there that she became involved
with a college group called the Free Burma Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Burma is widely considered to have one of the most repressive
regimes in the world under a military that has been in power since
1962. Most recently, Burma has been in the headlines because of the
government's standoff with pro-democracy leader and Nobel Peace
Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi. Burma is refusing to allow her to
meet with other members of her party.
</P>
<P>
   While Portsmouth was celebrating Friday, the White House issued
a rebuke of Burma's treatment of the group of foreign activists.
</P>
<P>
   ``But while we're pleased that these American citizens will be
returning to the United States, this episode is a reminder that
there is an absence of protection of human rights in Burma and a
failure of the Burmese government to allow freedom of expression,''
said White House spokesman Mike McCurry.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton's friends expect her to return home as determined and
passionate as ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll probably find her in another country in six months,''
said Dominguez. ``She has a passion for this, and she's such a
driven person.''

BAY STATE BLOCKED FROM CATALOGUING IMATES' BLOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHEN KIEHL  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Bucking a national trend allowing states to create DNA
databases of criminal offenders through blood samples, a
Massachusetts Superior Court judge ruled Friday that such a state
law is unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Isaac Borenstein ruled that the purpose of the law _ to
identify possible suspects in crimes and deter repeat offenders _
did not outweigh the  &UR;  &LR; privacy citizens are guaranteed under the
Fourth Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regardless of the state's compelling interest, an unjustified
random bodily intrusion without any indication of individualized
suspicion is unreasonable and intolerable,'' Borenstein said in his
ruling.
</P>
<P>
   The state said it would appeal the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the decision reinforces is that police can't simply round
up all the usual suspects and require them to submit their DNA to a
databank,'' said the Committee for Public Counsel's Benjamin Keehn,
an attorney for the plaintiffs. ``If it's OK to grab prisoner's
DNA, then why isn't OK to grab the DNA of welfare recipients or
homeless people or any politcally vulnerable group? This really
does affect all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was brought by the American Civil Liberties Union of
Massachusetts and the Committee for Public Counsel on behalf of six
people in prison or on probation.
</P>
<P>
   While 47 other states have laws similar to the one in
Massachusetts, many of them have never been challenged or are
narrower in scope than the one Borenstein struck down, experts
said. Attorneys for the plaintiffs said they hope the ruling will
encourage challenges of the laws already in place in other states.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts law, passed last September, required anyone
convicted of any of 33 crimes, or anyone in prison or on parole for
committing those crimes, to submit a blood sample that would be
used in a DNA database.
</P>
<P>
   The law went into effect in January and 1,200 samples were taken
before an injunction was issued against the collection. About
10,000 people would be affected by the law.
</P>
<P>
   The state argued that prisoners, through their criminal actions,
give up some of their rights, and the law was necessary as a public
safety measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those people targeted don't have the same expectations of
privacy as law-abiding citizens have,'' said Assistant Attorney
General Gregory I. Massing. ``There is a tremendous chance that
(prisoners and parollees) will commit crimes in the future, and
this will help solve those crimes and deter them from committing
new crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   The case turned on the Fourth Amendment, which prohibits
unreasonable searches and seizures.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, there must be a strong suspicion that an
individual has committed a crime before subjecting that person to
submit a blood sample for DNA testing. But the state argued that
the intrusion of taking a blood sample was minimal and justified in
the interests of law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   Borenstein, however, ruled that to accept such an argument would
effectively turn the Fourth Amendment on its head.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling was applauded by prisoners, parolees and their
advocates.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Dwight Harrison, who is on parole after serving 16 years for
an armed robbery and attempted murder in 1978, said the ruling
means he can finally try to live a normal life.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison, 41, who lives in the Boston area, received a letter in
March informing him that he had to submit a blood sample for the
DNA database. Such a requirement, he said, represents an extension
of the sentence that he has already served.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel strongly that my time is done and I should be able to
be free and go on with my life,'' said Harrison, who was not a part
of the lawsuit, but did testify at a hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Legal and genetic experts criticized the law as being too broad
in the crimes and people it covered and not specific enough in how
the DNA samples could be used.
</P>
<P>
   They pointed out that the law did not restrict the use of the
DNA samples to identification of crime suspects.
</P>
<P>
   The samples could be used for research or to create genetic
profiles of certain groups, experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the law did not require the state to share DNA
information with the person it came from, said Paul Billings, who
is on the board of the Council for Responsible Genetics in
Cambridge, Mass.  &UR;  &LR; For example, it could mean the state would know
about &UR;  &LR; potential health problems, but not share that valuable
information with the person who gave the sample.

BAY STATE 10-MILE LIQUOR SALE LAW RULED UNFAIR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ARMSTRONG  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In a ruling that could lead to Sunday liquor sales
across the state, a Superior Court judge ruled Friday that the law
allowing liquor stores in communities within 10 miles of the New
Hampshire border to open on Sundays is unfair to stores outside
that zone.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Margaret R. Hinkle ruled the state could not penalize an
Essex liquor store owner who opened his store on Sundays to
challenge the 10-mile law. His store was just outside the border
area. Hinkle said the Legislature's choice of a 10-mile cutoff was
arbitrary and therefore violated the due-process rights of
storeowners outside the limit.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides in the lawsuit offered starkly different opinions
Friday on the impact of the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing this decision does is make the rules that allow
stores in the 10-mile towns to open on Sundays applicable
statewide, as it should be,'' said Evan T. Lawson, the Boston
lawyer who represented package store owners fighting the law.
</P>
<P>
   But a spokeswoman for the state Alcoholic Beverages Control
Commission, which enforces state liquor laws, said the agency
interpreted the judge's ruling to mean all liquor stores in
Massachusetts must now close on Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   The spokeswoman, Kim Hinden, said the state would file a motion
next week asking the judge to clarify her ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, she said all liquor stores in the state should
continue operating under the existing rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are within 10 miles and have a permit you should
sell,'' she said. ``If not, you shouldn't do it until we seek
clarification.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if the ban on Sunday sales outside the 10-mile area is
lifted, store owners must also receive permission from local
licensing authorities before they can sell liquor on Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts first allowed Sunday sales in border towns in 1990
in response to competition from state-owned stores in neighboring
New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Chisholm, the owner of Chebacco Liquor Mart in Essex, said
the law discriminated against package store owners just outside the
10-mile area.
</P>
<P>
   For nine months in 1996 he opened his store on Sundays and
flouted the law. His plan, made in concert with other store owners
who called themselves the New Border Coalition, was to challenge
the law.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the ABCC caught up with Chisholm and ordered a
30-day suspension for violating the Sunday law. Chisholm responded
with a lawsuit, calling the law unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Chisholm pointed to the neighboring town of Ipswich to make his
point that the law was fundamentally unfair. A small uninhabited
swath of beachland and marshes in Ipswich is within 10 miles of the
New Hampshire border, allowing liquor stores in that town to stay
open on Sunday even though the stores themselves are not within 10
miles of the border.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Chisholm said, his store is roughly the same distance
from New Hampshire as at least one of the Ipswich stores.
</P>
<P>
   Hinkle appeared sympathetic to that argument.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is...whether a store may sell on Sundays is only
tangentially related to its proximity to the border,'' she wrote in
her 16-page decision.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general's office, which represented the state in
the lawsuit, argued it was within the Legislature's authority to
create a border area where Sunday sales are allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Lawson said the ruling would allow Chisholm to open this Sunday,
but he advised his client to await clarification from the judge
before selling liquor on Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   The law prohibiting Sunday liquor sales is based on the belief
that the day should be ``a uniform day of rest and relaxation,''
according to the ruling.

</P>
<P>
   ``Um ... can I have it?''
</P>
<P>
   No doubt about it, the translucent turquoise-and-white iMac
draws a reaction. But the big question is whether that reaction
will translate into sales when the highly anticipated _ and highly
hyped _ consumer Macintosh goes on sale starting Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   For Cupertino, Calif.-based Apple, the company that arguably
launched the personal computer revolution, the success of the iMac
is directly related to the survival of the company.
</P>
<P>
   For Apple, the iMac is the equivalent of the K-car, the boxy,
inexpensive automobile that Chrysler hoped would pull it back from
the financial abyss in the early 1980s. The K-car ultimately saved
Chrysler, and Apple is counting on the iMac to do the same for it.
</P>
<P>
   But while the K-car was an ugly, functional machine, the iMac is
easily the most stylish computer available. At the very least,
Apple will get high marks for its radical departure in PC design.
It puts to shame all those beige boxes now sitting on store
shelves.
</P>
<P>
   The iMac is aimed at consumers, a market Apple has not actively
courted in two years. It will sell initially for $1,299 _ slightly
more than low-priced consumer machines that use the competing
Microsoft Windows 98 operating system.
</P>
<P>
   So far, so good.
</P>
<P>
   Apple says it has received 150,000 pre-orders. Depending on
who's doing the speculating, estimated sales for the iMac range
between 500,000 and 800,000.
</P>
<P>
   A year and a half ago, Apple was bleeding red ink. Interim chief
executive Steven Jobs has turned that around, and the company has
become profitable again. Its shares have soared, going in the
opposite direction of the retreating stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Although Apple has had several quarters of profits, those have
largely come because costs have been slashed and competition has
evaporated. Under Jobs' direction, Apple forced several
manufacturers to stop making Macintosh clones. Now Apple has the
business all to itself _ but it's not much business. Some analysts
estimate Apple's market share has dropped to around 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Apple needs the iMac to be a hit. And a ``hit,'' in this case,
means it must sell to more than just the notoriously devoted Mac
faithful.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will clearly get the Mac-heads excited,'' said Tim Bajarin,
an analyst with the San Jose, Calif.-based Creative Strategies.
``While we believe the iMac will help Apple's fortunes in the short
term, it will buy them some time to deal with their problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``But for Apple to be around three to five years from now, they
must find a way to grow the company. That's why they are launching
a $100 million ad campaign _ the heart of it is to get the
attention of the new user.``
</P>
<P>
   Apple is entering a different consumer market from the one it
left in 1996. Analysts estimate that as many as 50 percent of all
home PCs sold now are under $1,000. There are complete systems
available _ monitor, CPU and printer _ for under $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Although it's the least expensive Macintosh, it is far from
underpowered. It comes with a 233-megahertz PowerPC G3 chip, a
speedy processor that Apple claims is much faster then Intel
Corp.'s Pentium and Pentium II equivalents.
</P>
<P>
   It also has 32 megabytes of memory, a 4-gigabyte hard drive, a
56K modem and a built-in 15-inch color monitor.
</P>
<P>
   It's packed into a wedge-shaped, see-through case that looks
like a 1960s-era portable TV. Apple has paid close attention to
this look _ the mouse, the keyboard and even the power cable are
translucent.
</P>
<P>
   Apple brags about the speed of the PowerPC G3 chip _ its press
materials describe it as ``Pentium-toasting.'' But running it
side-by-side with a 300-megahertz Pentium II Toshiba Equium 100,
the iMac doesn't open applications, or switch between them, any
faster. Apple's claims are based on running programs that require
intense computations, not necessarily the way consumers use a
computer day to day.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, the iMac's slick design gets in the way of its
usefulness. The computer's mouse, for example, is perfectly round
and smaller than most other mice. It looks cool, with the internal,
two-color ball that is visible through its clear plastic. But it's
too small to be comfortable, and the round shape makes it easy to
lose the mouse's orientation _ in other words, which way is ``up.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``i'' in iMac stands for Internet, and Apple is touting this
as a particularly easy way to get online. When an iMac owner starts
the computer for the first time, an Internet Setup Assistant walks
him or her through the process, then volunteers to make a dial-up
connection to the Net.
</P>
<P>
   Much has been made of the fact that the iMac does not come with
a floppy disk, a staple on all other personal computers. Apple's
Jobs has said that floppies are on the way out, and the iMac is
here to help hurry their demise.
</P>
<P>
   But it's also been left out to cut costs. Floppy drives on a
Macintosh include a motor that ejects the floppy disk, and thus
they cost more to make than the drives found on Windows-based
systems, which have a mechanical ejection system.
</P>
<P>
   External disk drives _ ranging from traditional floppy drives
that hold 1.44 megabytes of data to those that hold over 100
megabytes _ will be available, but they will be pricey, costing
between $80 and $120.
</P>
<P>
   Although the iMac is expected to sell well, Apple's showdown
will come after initial wave of buyers has come and gone.
</P>
<P>
   That's when first-time buyers walk into a computer store and
spot the iMac on the shelf, next to Compaq Presarios, IBM Aptivas,
Hewlett-Packard Pavilions and Packard Bell Legend Supremes.
</P>
<P>
   Apple's worst nightmare will be if those new-to-computing
shoppers stop to admire the iMac _ oohing-and-ahing over its slick
design and clicking around its easy-to-use interface _ and then
take home a Windows machine.
</P>
<P>
   If that happens, Apple made have made a neat product that sold
well to the faithful, but it will have gained nothing.

TWO FROM BAY STATE ISLANDS DIE OF TICK-BORNE DISEASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIE C. SANCHEZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ State public health officials are using two recent
deaths from babesiosis, a tick-borne disease with malaria-like
symptoms, to remind people to use caution around ticks.
</P>
<P>
   The fatal infections were the first in Massachusetts caused by
the illness in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Death is a very rare event with babesiosis,'' said Bela
Matyas, director of epidemiology for the state department of public
health. ``There's no evidence that the number of cases or their
virulence have increased.''
</P>
<P>
   A 67-year-old man from Martha's Vineyard died on Sunday and a
39-year-old from Nantucket died on Aug. 3 after they contracted the
illness last month.
</P>
<P>
   People at greatest risk for serious infections of babesiosis are
those who have had spleens removed, have compromised immune systems
from conditions like HIV, or are over the age of 50, said Dr. Peter
Krause of the Connecticut Children's Medical Center in Hartford,
Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Francis Pachico was 67 and Phil Bresten, 39, had had a spleen
removed.
</P>
<P>
   Babesiosis has primarily been contained in southeastern
Connecticut, Block Island, Nantucket, Martha's Vineyard and eastern
Long Island, Krause said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that people who have been in areas where ticks abound
should watch for symptoms that last more than a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have either a persistent fever or become pretty ill
after a tick bite, you should be checked,'' said Krause who
published an article about the disease in a recent issue of the New
England Journal of Medicine. Symptoms also include chills, fatigue,
and headaches, sometimes followed by profuse sweating and muscle
pain.
</P>
<P>
   The illness is detected through blood tests, and treated with
quinine and the antibiotic clindamycin.
</P>
<P>
   A protozoan parasite in the tick causes the disease by invading
red blood cells. In rare cases, it has been transmitted through
blood transfusions.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, 21 cases were reported in the state, Matyas said. In
1998, from May through Friday, 11 cases have been reported. Last
year 17 cases were reported May through August.
</P>
<P>
   To prevent infection, Matyas advised that people stick to paths
when walking through thick woods, wear long pants tucked into
socks, and check the body regularly for ticks since infection
occurs when ticks remain attached for 24 to 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Like Lyme disease, which is also carried by ticks and produces
fever and fatigue, babesiosis is increasing with a growing deer
population, Krause said. He predicted that babesiosis diagnoses
would increase because of a greater awareness among doctors and
more laboratories carrying tests for it.
</P>
<P>
   Lyme disease, however, is more prevalent and poses a greater
public health threat, he said.

`AVENGERS' MAY DRIVE TV SERIES FANS TO REVENGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
OUR RATING: 1 Star 
By GLENN WHIPP  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Since Warner Bros. does not want me to draw any
comparisons between their feature version of ``The Avengers'' and
the 1960s British television series (which was the official reason
the film wasn't screened for critics prior to its release Friday),
I will save all such observations until the end of this review.
</P>
<P>
   That out of the way, let me say that ``The Avengers'' is quite
horrible all on its own merits. It is dull, incomprehensible and
completely absent of wit and fun. As I was leaving the theater, a
couple who had paid for a later showing were demanding their money
back. And as far as I know, their dissatisfaction didn't come from
any nostalgic fondness for the original John Steed and Emma Peel.
They simply knew a turkey when they saw one.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is so amazingly bad on so many different levels,
primarily because its director, Jeremiah Chechik (``National
Lampoon's Christmas Vacation,'' ``Benny &AMP; Joon'') has absolutely no
business being behind a $60 million special-effects film rooted in
arch British humor.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a script that makes the ``Batman'' movies (more of
an inspiration here than the TV series) look like Tolstoy and lead
actors (a completely miscast Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman) who
have no on-screen chemistry. When they kiss, they're like a couple
of androids on Valium. Sure, we've heard of British reserve. But if
these characters were any more restrained, you'd begin to suspect
they had been lobotomized.
</P>
<P>
   Fiennes plays John Steed, the British agent in the bowler hat,
and Thurman is Emma Peel, the British agent in tight, form-fitting
designer garb. We mention the clothes so prominently because they
have more personality than anything else in the film. Steed and
Peel are battling Sean Connery's villain, a cipher intent on
controlling the weather for reasons he keeps to himself.
</P>
<P>
   Connery is barely a presence here, and when he shows up, he's
reduced to uttering claptrap like: ``You will buy your weather from
me, and by God, you'll pay for it!'' It's obvious Connery knows
he's in a stinker as his mind seems to be elsewhere whenever he's
on screen. Maybe he's counting his paycheck or thinking of new ways
to fire his agent.
</P>
<P>
   If you've seen the TV show, you know what a wasted opportunity
this ``Avengers'' is. But you can't get blood from a stone or wit
from filmmakers who confuse vacant blank stares with whimsy. Way
back when, series actors Patrick Macnee and Diana Rigg were a
triumph of irresistible style over substance as Steed and Peel.
Here, style and substance take a beating. And it's a bloody awful
one at that.

<P>
   DOVER, N.H. _ Beneath the glass gaze of a great stuffed elk
head, Bill Clinton delivered an extraordinary oration here in the
winter of 1992 that historians will probably end up calling his
``Last Dog'' speech.
</P>
<P>
   His primary campaign badly wounded by allegations that he had
cheated on his wife and questions about his draft record, Clinton
defied speculation that he would have to drop out and instead,
vowed that he would persevere until ``the last dog dies.''
</P>
<P>
   Within days, New Hampshire residents rewarded his perseverance
with a second-place showing in their first-in-the-nation primary,
enough to keep his candidacy alive.
</P>
<P>
   This week, in that very same Elks hall, with Clinton facing the
most personally perilous moment of his presidency as he prepares to
testify before a grand jury Monday, New Hampshire residents voiced
yet another chorus of defiant indifference to allegations against
him _ and a wish that it would all, finally, go away.
</P>
<P>
   Pausing for emphasis, Bob Carroll, an auctioneer at an antiques
auction being held at the club, declared, ``Leave. The poor man.
Alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked later about his expectations of the president, in view of
reports that Clinton may say he had some sexual contact with Monica
Lewinsky, Carroll said, ``I think he should speak to the people _ I
think he should say he had this sexual encounter and it's between
he and his wife, not he and the world.'' And that should be that,
Carroll said.
</P>
<P>
   Such sentiments were often repeated among two dozen people
interviewed in the Elks bar, at the auction and around the
375-year-old community of Dover, and they appear to reflect broad
swaths of national public opinion as well.
</P>
<P>
   In a CBS News poll conducted between Tuesday and Thursday this
week among 1,579 adults, two-thirds of respondents said they
thought the charges against Clinton involved private matters that
did not affect his job as president. The poll, however, also found
rising sentiment in favor of an apology from the president if it
turns out that he lied under oath or instructed Ms. Lewinsky, the
former intern with whom he is accused of having an affair, to lie.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what Clinton should do if the charges against him are
true, 44 percent said he should apologize, up from 35 percent at
the end of July. Seventeen percent said he should resign, 13
percent called for impeachment proceedings, and 22 percent said the
matter should just be dropped.
</P>
<P>
   In general, 50 percent of respondents said they thought Clinton
should address the public after he testifies, against 41 percent
who thought he should not.
</P>
<P>
   In Dover, among Democrats and Republicans, Clinton fans and
foes, the broadest consensus seemed to concern an overwhelming
desire for this whole surreal episode in the history of the U.S.
presidency to end, the sooner the better. Some said they thought
Clinton should admit his affair with Ms. Lewinsky, if he had one;
others said he should stonewall; almost all said, in effect,
``Enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Certain phrases came up repeatedly: ``Between him and his
wife,'' and ``laughing stock of the world,'' and ``Skeletons in the
closet'' (as in, everyone has a few, especially sexual ones).
</P>
<P>
   And one theme, no matter how open-ended the question asked,
seemed to predominate: resentment about the price of the
investigation, both in terms of money and its absorption of public
attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's terrible for our nation and I truly think it's
not doing us any good around the world,'' said Inez DiMambro, a
68-year-old housewife and mother who was browsing among exquisite
dolls about to be auctioned off.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband is a Republican,'' added Ms. DiMambro, who votes as
an independent, ``and he's concerned, too, because he doesn't think
this is of great value to our nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, 68 percent of respondents in the CBS Poll sad that
whatever Clinton has done, the country would have been better off
without any investigation at all. A full half of Republicans
interviewed agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Such common antipathy for the process under way does not appear
to translate into agreement on whom to blame, however. Polls have
found that more people tend to blame the investigation or political
enemies for damaging the presidency than blame Clinton himself, but
there are still those like Ms. DiMambro's doll-shopping companion,
Diane King, who noted, ``He's the president. He should act more
presidential.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ms. King also expressed concern about the continuing effect the
White House scandal seems to be having on the country's moral
tenor, including the gutter-level discussions it prompts.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I heard the words ``O.S.'' once, I think I heard it 95
times and I really don't think it's necessary,'' she said,
referring to oral sex.
</P>
<P>
   Dover residents' responses also indicated just how pervasive
discussions of the scandal have become, from a high school student
who said her history class had compared Clinton's alleged
infidelities to those of Franklin D. Roosevelt, to Barrows' mention
of how the investigation is being used as an example in a criminal
justice class he has been taking in college.
</P>
<P>
   If the discussions of the investigation often float off into
salacious levity, it is partly because of a widespread belief that,
ultimately, the repercussions of all this will not be serious for
Clinton or for the presidency. There may be whispers about
impeachment proceedings on Capital Hill, but the prospect seems
incredible this far from Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the whole thing is going to be dropped,'' said George
Younger, a retired court bailiff and chagrinned Republican. ``The
Republicans do not want to see him impeached, because if he is,
Gore will have two years to solidify the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   For all their professed indignation at the attention paid the
scandal, Elks at the bar also found themselves discussing it for
the pure lurid fun of it.
</P>
<P>
   For all the humor, however, a sense of serious unease remained.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, said construction laborer David Pierce, ``I think
it's a travesty that people don't have better things to do with
this country than to investigate whether the president is sleeping
with obviously more-than-willing partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``How about let's talk about something really important _ the
New York Yankees!'' he said.

 &HT;    Rover won't be easy to come by at this weekend's Reds game
 &HT;    By Jenn Hildreth
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ All it takes to get one of the 15,000 Rover
beanie babies at the Reds game against the Montreal Expos this
Sunday is a ticket and a wristband.
</P>
<P>
   And, to the chagrin of many adults, you have to be 14 years old
or younger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids get the wristbands and kids get the beanie babies,'' said
Cal Levy, Reds marketing consultant. Adults are already complaining
about the age limit for the Reds first beanie baby promotion, but
Levy said the team has many other promotions which are also just
for kids.
</P>
<P>
   Rover, a red dog beanie baby retired on May 1, has an estimated
value of $15-$30, and it is expected to reach $40 by next year.
</P>
<P>
   Wristbands for the toys will be distributed starting at 9 a.m.
Sunday at gates 3 and 11 only, and all gates will open at 11:15 for
the 1:15 game.
</P>
<P>
   This season, beanie babies have proven successful in raising
attendance for many teams, including the Chicago Cubs, New York
Yankees, Detroit Tigers, and Texas Rangers. The Tigers game on Aug.
8 used ``Stripes'' (a tiger beanie baby) to more than double their
regular season attendance average.
</P>
<P>
   Levy said the Reds have not seen a significant jump in ticket
sales yet, but he said they are hoping for a last-minute surge.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a good chance that you can wait and buy your ticket
that day (and still get a beanie baby),'' said Levy, pointing out
that the likelihood is not great that 15,000 kids 14 and under have
already bought tickets.

JUSTICE, NEWS MEDIA FILE BRIEFS FOR ACCESS IN MICROSOFT CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Lawyers for the news media Friday accused Microsoft
of seeking to rewrite an act of Congress in the company's effort to
block public access to pre-trial testimony of company CEO Bill
Gates and others.
</P>
<P>
   The company first wanted to ``proceed with secret depositions in
contravention of the statute,'' and now is arguing that the law
allowing access to depositions ``does not mean what it plainly
says,'' the lawyers argued.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft's effort to rewrite an Act of Congress is without
merit,'' said the lawyers, representing the New York Times Co., the
Seattle Times, ZDTV, ZDNet, Bloomberg News and Reuters America Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The media lawyers were supported Friday by lawyers for the
federal government and for 20 states and the District of Columbia
in three separate briefs urging a federal appellate panel to uphold
a lower court ruling allowing public access to the remaining 25
depositions in the Microsoft case.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is expected to reply on Monday, reiterating its desire
to keep the depositions closed, and the appeals panel could rule
shortly after that.
</P>
<P>
   The depositions are to be taken in cases filed by the federal
and state governments accusing Microsoft of violating the nation's
anti-trust laws to win a monopoly in the market for Internet
browsers. The company denies any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   The news media have demanded access to the remaining
depositions, citing a little-known 1913 statute that guarantees
public access to the taking of evidence in civil anti-trust suits
brought by the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the Justice Department recommended to Congress last
year that the law be repealed. But Congress did not act on the
recommendation, and now the Justice Department says the law must be
followed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft's reading of the Publicity in Taking Evidence Act
cannot withstand even casual scrutiny,'' the Justice Department
argued in its brief Friday. ``The language is absolutely clear and
unambiguous.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department said it is now engaged in negotiations
with Microsoft to avoid the release of confidential information
during a public deposition.
</P>
<P>
   The wrangling over depositions has delayed preparations for the
case. Gates was scheduled to be deposed last Wednesday, but the
deposition was postponed while the debate over access is waged.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the delay, lawyers for the federal and state
governments and Microsoft on Thursday urged U.S. District Judge
Thomas Penfield Jackson to delay the trial by two weeks from its
scheduled start date of Sept. 8. The judge has not yet decided
whether to accept that proposal.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Guided by a team of meteorologists, balloonist Steve Fossett
threaded his way through an ``atmospheric minefield'' Friday and
approached the west coast of Australia, completing nearly half of
his attempted round-the-world flight.
</P>
<P>
   Fossett was expected to reach Australia late Saturday. The
54-year-old commodities broker and adventurer seemed certain to
break the ballooning distance record he set in 1997, when he flew
10,360.6 miles from St. Louis to Nonkhar, India.
</P>
<P>
   On this, his fourth attempt to circle the world nonstop, Fossett
is again flying solo in an unpressurized capsule.
</P>
<P>
   Although pitfalls lie ahead over Australia and the vast expanse
of the Pacific Ocean beyond, hopes for a successful completion of
the transglobal flight were rising.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of his first full week of flight Friday, which began
in Mendoza, Argentina, Fossett still faced daunting problems as he
sought to be the first balloonist to circumnavigate the earth. But
by almost continuously changing altitude, his big Solo Spirit
balloon escaped a succession of wayward winds that could have
carried him southward toward Antarctica or northwestward over the
Indian Ocean. Either course would have doomed his flight.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Rice, the leader of Fossett's meteorology team in his
mission control headquarters at Washington University in St. Louis,
particularly feared the northwestward winds.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would have injected Steve into a high-pressure,
counterclockwise circulation pattern, going nowhere,'' Rice said.
``For a balloonist, that would be like getting stuck in a giant
parking lot.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no way to steer a balloon, except by climbing or
descending into winds headed in the right direction; globally, that
direction is generally from west to east. To exploit high-speed
winds that blow under the jet streams, Fossett has been flying as
high as possible, and in his unpressurized capsule he must breathe
oxygen almost continuously.
</P>
<P>
   The first big problem arose Wednesday when a southward wind
current cut across Fossett's track just east of the southern tip of
Africa. On Rice's advice, Fossett descended to 20,000 feet and
managed to squeak past the danger. But a still greater hazard came
Thursday at another crossroad in the sky. A strong wind began
nudging Fossett ever farther northward, toward the ``parking lot.''
</P>
<P>
   As an emergency measure, Rice asked Fossett to climb to about
29,000 feet _ the height of Mount Everest. Even at that altitude,
the balloon was only 7,000 feet higher than the northward current
that had to be avoided. As tension mounted and the hours passed,
the team waited to see if the maneuver had worked. There was little
sleep for Fossett or his ground crew.
</P>
<P>
   But by early Friday, the crisis seemed to be past. Fossett was
told he would have to remain at 28,000 feet or higher to stay out
of trouble; meanwhile, however, the balloon had changed its course
due east toward Australia, as planned. The maneuver had succeeded.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Fossett's team, with which he communicates by e-mail, using a
lap-top computer and the Satcom-C satellite, believes he now stands
a fair chance of completing the rest of the trip, although any
delays caused by failing winds could deplete his supply of propane
fuel and force him down in the vast South Pacific, far from any
shipping lane. He is consuming a lot of oxygen, and if his supply
runs short he will have to descend into much less favorable wind
patterns.
</P>
<P>
   Without the technological progress of the last 20 years, Rice
said, it would not have been possible to get this far. Twenty years
ago last Tuesday, Rice was acting as the meteorologist for the
Double Eagle II as it completed the first balloon crossing of the
Atlantic Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back then, you just plotted your course with a pair of
dividers and off you went,'' Rice said. ``But today we have Global
Positioning Satellite tracking, we have a great communications
satellite, and we have these wonderful atmospheric models from the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration that allow us to
calculate precisely where to look for the winds we need.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, scientists have tried to improve climate
forecasting with the help of powerful computers, using programs
that combine data from many different places. These programs, or
models, take into account fine details of air pressure,
temperature, moisture, wind speeds, altitudes and directions.
</P>
<P>
   A forecaster must gather as many data as possible from
satellites, aircraft and sensors on the ground and the sea to fill
in the blanks in a model, which then computes probable conditions
at any specific place and time. Such modeling, although still very
imperfect, is essential for weather forecasting and for tracking
storms, smoke from volcanoes, dust from desert storms, fallout from
nuclear explosions and balloon flights.
</P>
<P>
   If Fossett succeeds in circling the world, he will win the
Budweiswer Cup and a $1 million prize offered by Anheuser-Busch
Cos. Half of the prize will be donated to charity.

CONGRESSMAN APPEALS DISMISSAL OF LAWSUIT AGAINST COLLEAGUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Republican Conference Chairman John Boehner
Friday appealed a judge's dismissal of his lawsuit against Rep. Jim
McDermott, saying that the ruling, if allowed to stand, would
undermine the security of electronic communications throughout the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   Boehner, R-Ohio, said that, in deciding to appeal, he relied on
advice from three House Republicans with expertise in law
enforcement, each of whom suggested he attempt to revive his
lawsuit. In the lawsuit, Boehner accuses McDermott, a Seattle
Democrat, of violating electronic communications privacy laws by
allegedly leaking to newspapers a recording of a phone conversation
in which Boehner was a participant.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Thomas Hogan threw out Boehner's lawsuit
last month, saying that McDermott's alleged actions were protected
by the First Amendment to the Constitution. McDermott has declined
to say what role he played in leaking the conversation among House
GOP leaders, a report of which wound up on the front page of The
New York Times. The leaders were discussing how to react to House
Speaker Newt Gingrich's ethics woes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The breakdown in civility and bipartisanship in Congress sunk
to new lows in January 1997, when it became clear that the ranking
minority member of the House Ethics Committee (McDermott) had
played a direct, unethical, and illegal role in a plot to topple
the duly-elected Speaker of the House,'' Boehner said in a letter
to his House GOP colleagues. ``The purpose of my civil suit against
Representative McDermott has been, and will continue to be, to send
a clear and unambiguous message to those who might one day follow
his example: no American should be permitted to violate the law in
pursuit of a political goal.''
</P>
<P>
   McDermott's lawyer, Frank Cicero, said he was not surprised that
Boehner decided to appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe Judge Hogan was correct, and properly applied the
law in his ruling,'' Cicero said. ``Because we believe he was
correct, we believe the decision will be upheld on appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   Boehner Friday released letters from three House Republicans,
including House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill.,
Rep. Deborah Pryce, R-Ohio, a former state judge, and Rep. Michael
Oxley, R-Ohio, a former FBI special agent.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde said that he had asked his staff lawyers to review Hogan's
decision, and that ``without exception, each person independently
concluded that the ruling is susceptible to being overturned on
appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am concerned with the court's conclusion that the wiretap
statute does not prevent a criminal from stealing a conversation
and giving it to someone else, who is then free to disseminate the
information with impunity,'' Hyde wrote. ``This certainly was not
the intent of the Congress in enacting the statute.''
</P>
<P>
   McDermott's alleged actions are also under investigation by the
Justice Department.

GLOBE, REPORTER FACE FINES FOR REFUSING TO REVEAL SOURCES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CINDY RODRIGUEZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A Superior Court judge Friday imposed fines on The
Boston Globe and medical reporter Richard A. Knox for violating a
court order seeking the names of confidential sources used in
articles that are the basis of a libel suit.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lois Ayash is suing Knox and The Globe, alleging she was
unfairly blamed for the drug overdose that caused the death of
Globe health columnist Betsy Lehman. Lehman died in 1994 after
being given an overdose of chemotherapy. Several months later, Knox
wrote an article that stated that Ayash had countersigned the
flawed medication order. The Globe later published a correction,
acknowledging that it erred in identifying Ayash as signing the
drug order. The article also called Ayash the ``leader of a team''
of doctors at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute who treated Lehman.
</P>
<P>
   Ayash's libel suit says Knox and the newspaper caused injury to
her reputation. In related claims against Dana-Farber and David
Livingston, a former physician-in-chief at Dana-Farber, Ayash
contends that she was singled out when others at the hospital
should have been held accountable.
</P>
<P>
   Ayash's attorney, Joan A. Lukey, said getting the names of
confidential sources used in the Knox series is vital.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is basically hamstrung in her ability to prepare her case
against all of the defendants without the confidential sources
being identified,'' Lukey said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In his decision, Suffolk County Superior Court Judge Peter M.
Lauriat said The Globe's refusal to comply with a Feb. 23 discovery
order constitutes a contempt of court. Lauriat ordered that
starting Aug. 24, Knox must pay the court $100 per day until he
names the sources. Each week thereafter, the fine increases an
additional $100 a day. The Globe will be fined $1,000 a day the
first week. Each week thereafter, the fine is increased an
additional $1,000 a day.
</P>
<P>
   Al Larkin, Globe vice president and assistant to the publisher,
called the fines ``onerous.''
</P>
<P>
   Larkin said The Globe will appeal the decision and ask that the
fines be stayed until the appeal is decided.
</P>
<P>
   ``As much as the Globe respects Judge Lauriat's admonition that
`no man is above the law' we also know what other courts have said:
reporters should not be forced to disclose the identities of their
confidential sources. Period. The right to protect those sources is
a crucial aspect of newsgathering and a fundamental element of the
First Amendment,'' Larkin said.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A record number of people, more than 3.9 million
adults _ one in 35 _were on probation or parole in 1997, according
to Justice Department statistics released Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; BEGIN STATE INSERTS &QR;
</P>
<P>
   In Colorado, more than 45,400 adults were on probation and more
than 4,000 were on parole, an increase of more than 25 percent over
the previous year. A study based on the statistics stated that the
parole population increase may have resulted from a state law
mandating a period of parole supervision for all persons sentenced
to prison for crimes committed on or after July 1, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, more than 230,000 adults were on probation and more
than 8,400 were on parole.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, more than 148,400 adults were on probation and more
than 21,900 were on parole.
</P>
<P>
   In North Carolina, more than 105,000 adults were on probation
and more than 8,100 were on parole.
</P>
<P>
   In Ohio, more than 118,700 adults were on probation and more
than 6,800 were on parole.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; END STATE INSERTS &QR;
</P>
<P>
   Over half of those on probation or parole nationally had felony
convictions; more than one-fourth were convicted of a misdemeanor,
and; more than 10 percent were on probation for driving while
intoxicated or under the influence of alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   The remainder, more than 685,000 adults, were on parole, a
conditional supervised release following a prison term. Nearly all
had felony convictions. Half of the parolees had received a
mandatory release because of a sentencing statute or laws requiring
early release for good behavior. The others had their parole
approved by a parole board.
</P>
<P>
   The study also showed that:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Nationwide, women account for 21 percent of all probationers
and 11 percent of the parolees.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Blacks represent more than a third of probationers and almost
half of the parolees.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Hispanics represent 16 percent of probationers and 21 percent
of the parolees.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1.6 million probationers and 400,000 parolees were
discharged from supervision last year. More than 60 percent of
those exiting probation, and more than 40 percent of those exiting
parole, successfully met the conditions of their supervision.
</P>
<P>
   During the same year, 18 percent of probationers and 41 percent
of parolees who were discharged from supervision were jailed
because of a rule violation or new offense.
</P>
<P>
   The remainder unsuccessfully exited probation or parole for
variety or reasons including death.

US SEIZES FUGITIVE GANGSTER'S CONDO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: Fla.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICIA NEALON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The FBI and federal prosecutors may not know where fugitive
Massachusetts gangster James ``Whitey'' Bulger is keeping himself
these days but they now can be sure he's not hiding out at his
condominium in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The $160,000 condo in Clearwater is now the official property of
the federal government, which took legal steps last spring to seize
it because they said Bulger bought the condo as part of a
money-laundering scheme.
</P>
<P>
   The forfeiture, which became final when Bulger didn't respond to
legal ads placed in newspapers in Clearwater and Boston or to
notices sent to his last known address in South Boston, was
approved by a federal judge late last month. On Thursday, sealed
court affidavits in the case were opened, according to the US
Attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
   Bulger, the South Boston crime boss and longtime FBI informant,
fled before he, his criminal partner Stephen Flemmi, and various
Mafia associates were indicted on federal extortion and
racketeering charges in January 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Flemmi, who was also an FBI informant, said in court papers that
he and Bulger were tipped off to the upcoming indictment so they
could flee.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government now owns Unit 216, Bayside Gardens II, at
the Sand Key Condominium in Clearwater. In the civil suit seeking
forfeiture of the property, federal prosecutors said the money used
to buy the condo in April 1993 came from a joint checking account
held by Bulger and his brother, John.
</P>
<P>
   But all the money in the account had been deposited by Bulger or
by others on his account, according to the US Attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
   The money came from two sources, according to prosecutors:
Bulger's proceeds from a still-disputed winning Mass Millions
lottery ticket, as well as the $360,000 profit he made in December
1989 in a real-estate ``flip'' involving the same-day purchase and
sale of the South Boston Liquor Mart, reportedly his criminal
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Bulger's sister, Jean Holland, is still fighting a court
decision in January 1996 which forfeited Bulger's $1.9 million
share of the winning lottery ticket to the government.
</P>
<P>
   And his brother, John, is appealing the dismissal in May of his
claim to nearly $200,000 seized in November 1996 from a
safe-deposit box and two bank accounts he held jointly with his
brother.

AN IRAQI DEFECTOR WARNS OF IRAQ'S NUCLEAR WEAPONS RESEARCH 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JUDITH MILLER and JAMES RISEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   An Iraqi scientist who defected to the United States has
publicly described for the first time the inner workings of Iraq's
three-decade effort to build a nuclear bomb.
</P>
<P>
   The scientist, Khidhir Abdul Abas Hamza, said that before he
fled Iraq in 1994 he helped train a cadre of young scientists who,
working with more senior scientists involved in other projects,
would be capable of quickly resuming Iraq's atomic weapons program
if the United Nations cuts back on its inspections and, ultimately,
lifts economic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Hamza is the highest-ranking scientist ever to defect from
Baghdad, and his comments, in nearly 10 hours of interviews, come
as a new confrontation is building over whether Baghdad has
dismantled its chemical, nuclear and biological programs. Iraq has
in recent days refused to cooperate further with U.N. weapons
inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   In the interviews, Hamza, 59, whose defection was an important
intelligence coup for the United States that nearly slipped through
American fingers because of the CIA's inattention, drew a chilling
picture of life as an Iraqi scientist. He said his colleagues were
lavishly rewarded for their successes and tortured by the secret
police when they failed to deliver.
</P>
<P>
   He said Iraq's nuclear weapons program was personally directed
by Saddam Hussein, Iraq's leader, since its inception 27 years ago.
It was abetted, he said, by a host of Western companies, which sold
Iraq sophisticated equipment as they ``winked and laughed'' at
patently false cover stories.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the Persian Gulf War in 1991, Hamza said, Iraq had
completed all the research and testing needed for an atomic weapon
and was feverishly trying to make at least one crude bomb using
uranium from civilian reactors. This effort, Hamza said, could have
produced a bomb in a few months, but it was disrupted by the allied
bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Only after the war did U.S. intelligence officials learn that
they had grossly underestimated Iraq's nuclear program, which they
had believed to be 10 years from producing a nuclear bomb. But
Hamza's defection to the United States and his subsequent
debriefing by the CIA brought fresh details to light, including
these:
</P>
<P>
   Iraq's peaceful nuclear power program, begun 30 years ago, was
quickly turned into a cover for the secret bomb program, which went
ahead even as Baghdad opened up its research reactors to Western
inspection.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's intensive campaign in the 1970s and '80s to stop Iraq
from acquiring a bomb accomplished little. The 1981 Israeli bombing
raid that destroyed Iraq's French-built nuclear reactor prompted
Saddam to drop the pretense of a peaceful atomic effort and to go
``full steam'' on a covert program to build a bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq took advantage of America's open access to valuable
scientific information. Hamza said that as a senior member of
Iraq's nuclear program, he spent time at American university
libraries studying the latest scientific journals and technical
accounts of America's nuclear efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Hamza, who intelligence officials said had been resettled here
by the CIA, said he was speaking out now because he was frustrated
that Saddam is still obstructing international inspections and
deceiving the West. U.S. officials said they did not authorize or
encourage Hamza to speak publicly, but they have confirmed many
elements of his account.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Hamza's defection has been a closely guarded secret.
A 1995 article in The Sunday Times of London and a 1997 book by
Andrew and Leslie Cockburn included detailed accounts of his
alleged kidnapping and assassination by secret Iraqi agents.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, his escape from Iraq is a remarkable spy yarn that
almost went awry. According to former and current intelligence
officials, the CIA initially rebuffed Hamza's appeals to defect to
the United States. He spent a year in Libya before the agency
realized its mistake and agreed to resettle him and rescue his
family from their home in downtown Baghdad.

</P>
<P>
   Born in southern Iraq into a family of Shiite Muslims, Hamza
graduated from Baghdad University and then studied physics in the
early 1960s at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and
Florida State University. After teaching briefly at Florida State
and a small college in Georgia, Hamza returned home in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   He became chairman of the physics department of Iraq's tiny
nuclear research center outside Baghdad, and was approached a year
later by two envoys from Saddam, who was then Iraq's vice president
but already its de facto ruler.
</P>
<P>
   He said they had asked him to help start a secret nuclear
weapons program under the cover of an expanded civilian atomic
energy program. Hamza said that though he had reservations about
building a nuclear bomb, he was enticed by the promise of extra
money and stature as well as the possibility that the civilian
program might benefit.
</P>
<P>
   A round of recent public hangings in Baghdad, he said,
underscored the dangers of refusing such a request.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, Hamza submitted Iraq's first comprehensive plan for
developing nuclear weapons to Saddam _ naming it the ``Hussein
plan.'' ``We didn't know then that Saddam hated his father and his
father's name,'' Hamza sheepishly recalled.
</P>
<P>
   The plan was quickly adopted, although Saddam rejected Hamza's
ambitious proposals for a separate nuclear city and lavish benefits
for its scientists. The Iraqi leader, he said, ``thought that a
separate atomic city would be too tempting a target for Iraq's
enemies.''
</P>
<P>
   At first, Hamza dealt with the leader through intermediaries.
But in 1973, he finally met his boss _ a volcanic encounter. During
a visit to the nuclear center, Saddam berated Hamza, his chief
planner, in front of his colleagues for failing to use frames to
display photographs of famous scientists on the office wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``The man was basically illiterate,'' Hamza said of Saddam.
``But here he was complaining about our insufficient respect for
great minds. I knew what he was doing: Saddam had to establish his
authority by putting the man who had made the plan in his place.''
</P>
<P>
   Saddam tightened his grip over the growing nuclear program in
1974, Hamza said, secretly naming himself chairman of the Iraqi
Atomic Energy Commission _ a fact that Iraq has denied to U.N.
inspectors. He also began controlling every aspect of the
scientists' lives, ordering them to divorce foreign wives and marry
Iraqi women, while forcing them to report any contact with
foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists ignored such orders at their peril. In January 1980,
Saddam had Iraq's most senior nuclear scientist, Jaafar D. Jaafar,
jailed and tortured until he agreed to work on an enrichment
program that would separate uranium particles and make bomb-grade
fuel. ``Jaafar was so badly beaten that he still jumps out of his
chair at the slightest scare,'' Hamza said.
</P>
<P>
   Hamza said he found it surprisingly easy to negotiate nuclear
cooperation agreements with the former Soviet Union, India, Brazil,
France and others to buy nuclear technology that could be used for
bombs under peaceful cover. ``If you go with the money and some
brains, it's easy to acquire the stuff,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, Iraq bought a French reactor and an Italian
fuel reprocessing facility, an IBM mainframe computer from the
United States, and machine tools to make centrifuge components from
the Swiss. In 1987 it almost bought for between $110 million and
$120 million a complete foundry to forge uranium and other
bomb-related components from Leybold and Degussa, two West German
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Hamza, who monitored the negotiations in Germany from a room
next to the meeting room, said the companies had offered to supply
not only the foundry but, for $200 million, a complete installation
that they promised could be built within months.
</P>
<P>
   He said Saddam rejected the tempting offer mainly because he
feared that such a large deal involving highly sensitive equipment
would have tipped off Western intelligence that Iraq was
transferring its bomb effort to a new site, known as Al Atheer.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we were astonished to see that the companies were actually
helping us find cover stories for some of the equipment we
needed,'' Hamza recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jorg Streitferdt, in-house counsel for Degussa, AG, based in
Frankfurt, Germany, which owned Leybold at the time, said the
companies did sell some equipment that ended up in Iraq's nuclear
program, and were later subjected to a series of investigations,
including a criminal inquiry by Germany.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that Degussa was exonerated on the charges of selling
vacuum furnaces to Iraq, largely because West Germany did not
require export licenses at that time for such sales. Though Degussa
executives suspected that Iraq might use the equipment for military
purposes given the ongoing Iran-Iraq war, he added, they did not
know that Iraq wanted it for a nuclear program.
</P>
<P>
   ``DeGussa and Leybold did not know what the equipment was for,''
Streitferdt said. ``The whole world did not know what Iraq was
about to do. We have learned our lesson and now have very tough
internal controls on our exports.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Years before Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait turned the country
into an international pariah, many of its nuclear-related purchases
were made with the blessing of the International Atomic Energy
Agency, the U.N. atomic energy monitors. The agency assumed that
Iraq was amassing the technical know-how for a peaceful power
program, and did little to investigate. The inspectors, Hamza said,
never asked even basic questions, ``like why an oil-rich country
like ours wanted nuclear power?''
</P>
<P>
   Hans Meyer, the spokesman for the IAEA, denied that the agency
had ignored warning signs that Iraq was trying to build a bomb.
``Our inspections were very tough,'' he said ``but under the rules
of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, we were only permitted to
inspect the facilities that Iraq had declared.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite such easy purchases, Hamza said, the program was beset
by almost constant setbacks _ the mysterious killings of senior
Iraqi nuclear scientists traveling in Europe, corruption, technical
blunders and vicious bureaucratic feuds among Iraq's scientists
seeking to generate bomb-grade enriched uranium. But Saddam had an
uncanny knack for turning such crises into opportunities, he said.
</P>
<P>
   After Israel bombed Iraq's reactor in 1981, the Iraqi leader
created the first completely independent, clandestine weapons
program, most of which remained hidden from Western inspectors for
nearly a decade. Liberated from having to march in lock step with
its peaceful cover, the nuclear weapons program staff grew from 400
to 7,000, Hamza said. And its budget soared.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when Iraq's bloody war with Iran was draining the
country's resources, nuclear scientists were insulated from the
war's economic ravages. The program was allotted as much as $150
million a month, Hamza said.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqi scientists were expected to produce results, and in
one crucial aspect of the program, they had little to show. Despite
years of effort, they had failed to produce the enriched uranium
that is an essential component in an atomic weapon.
</P>
<P>
   When Hussein Kamel, Saddam's ambitious son-in-law, took over the
nuclear program in 1987, Hamza said he helped him unmask a team of
scientists who were falsely claiming success in enriching uranium.
</P>
<P>
   Hamza was immediately named Iraq's director of weapons programs.
``I went to the palace'' he said, and ``emerged with a new car and
the title of a director general.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Kamel had ordered him to find a nuclear bomb trigger
while other scientists pursued at least five different methods of
separating uranium to make bomb-grade fuel.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. intelligence officials knew little of the Iraqi effort, in
part because the enrichment program relied on a technique abandoned
by the United States after the World War II Manhattan Project some
40 years earlier. ``They never put two and two together,'' Hamza
said.
</P>
<P>
   But the enrichment program was still slow to pay off, and Kamel
grew restless. The inevitable result was the onset of beatings and
torture for the scientists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hussein Kamel used to send scientists who displeased him to
the torture center in Al Taji,'' Hamza recounted. ``You couldn't
survive more than two weeks there.'' A director general of one
Iraqi nuclear program was beaten so badly that ``he couldn't come
to work for a week.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before the 1991 Gulf War, Kamel started a crash program
to develop a bomb. ``Kamel was crazy, but he managed to produce in
a month things that would normally take a year,'' Hamza said.
``Fear works well.''
</P>
<P>
   In December 1990 after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, Hamza said, he
asked to retire from the program. But he was told that he could do
so only if he agreed to stay on as a senior adviser and help train
Iraq's new generation of bombmakers.
</P>
<P>
   He left an important legacy. According to Hamza, the program had
perfected two methods for enriching uranium, and each could have
produced enough material to make a bomb in a year or two.
</P>
<P>
   Hamza witnessed the intensive American and allied bombing
campaign in the Persian Gulf War and was stunned at how little the
Americans and their allies knew about Iraq's program. More than
half of Iraq's major nuclear installations, most notably the
sprawling Al Atheer complex, the program's busy new weapons center,
were left largely untouched by the bombing raids.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Hamza's long-running bureaucratic feud with another
leading bomb scientist, the terror of working inside the Iraqi
police state and finally the killing of colleagues in the secret
program persuaded him to flee.
</P>
<P>
   The final straw came when the body of Adil Fayadh, one of Iraq's
chief nuclear procurement officers, was found near Hamza's farm.
``He had a farm next to mine,'' he said. ``They killed him and put
him in the ditch on his farm. It got me very worried. It had to be
Iraqi intelligence. That night, about two dozen people came to my
house, pale-faced and worried. They didn't know what was going to
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamza defected soon after, and he continues to anxiously follow
the Iraqi nuclear program from afar. He insisted that Saddam
remains determined to reconstitute the chemical, biological and
nuclear programs in which he invested so much. ``Without these
props, he would lose power,'' he said.

KENYA STILL REELING FROM EMBASSY BOMBING 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAIROBI, Kenya _ A fear swept the crowd gathered at the wreckage
of the U.S. Embassy the other day: that the 22-story Cooperative
Bank next door was about to collapse.
</P>
<P>
   The building is still standing, though crippled, just as Kenya,
its people and its economy are crippled.
</P>
<P>
   Like shock waves, the impact of the embassy bombing has spread
from downtown Nairobi across the nation. At least 247 Kenyans died
in the blast _ 20 for every American killed _ and each death
diminished the lives of a large circle.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not a family, not a district in Kenya that is not in
some way affected,'' said Gitobu Imanyara, an opposition member of
Parliament. ``In my district, 250 kilometers away, we will be
burying three victims of the blast tomorrow. The list of the dead _
they come from every part of this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Lists of the dead and of the 5,000 wounded are posted in Uhuru
Park, half a mile from the blast site, on boards that look like
paper and wood versions of the Vietnam memorial in Washington.
Mourners gather much as they do at the war monument, mute,
stock-still, lost in memory.
</P>
<P>
   At a table staffed by soldiers, Sarah Karugi, a clothing
designer, was grimly filling out forms to get a coffin for her
sister, Margaret Uambui, who was a secretary on the 14th floor of
the bank building. Ms. Karugi said five other relatives were
wounded, including two who worked at the embassy.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were innocent, and they were blown up,'' she said. Her
sister leaves three orphaned children still in school, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Gloria and Caroline Mutuiri, teen-age sisters, had gone to the
embassy to apply for visas. The line was long, so they went to
visit their mother, who worked next door at the Ufundi House. She
went out to buy them a snack. They died. She lived.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the dead who worked in and around the embassy made a
decent living. They were breadwinners for extended families. And
with the deaths, thousands of people have lost their lifelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Africa, one person supports about 10 people,'' said Solomon
Kasina, an automobile and electronics dealer who was among the
crowd gathered at the embassy one day to watch the cleanup. Robert
Shaw, the director of the Institute for Economic Affairs here,
said: ``When you give someone a job, you're feeding 20 or 30
people, giving them some sort of subsistence.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the 5,000 wounded are permanently scarred or blinded.
Hundreds of survivors never made it to hospital wards, but linger
outside with symptoms of extreme stress. Some of those will surely
develop lasting psychological problems, counselors said.
</P>
<P>
   June Koinange of the Kenya Psychological Association said:
``It's too early to tell but they are all manifesting the reactions
that become disorders.''
</P>
<P>
   Businesses, both big and small, are limping too. Small
shopkeepers spent the week sweeping up glass and debris from ruined
office buildings near the embassy.
</P>
<P>
   It may cost hundreds of millions of dollars simply to repair the
physical damage to the capital. Big businesses have been
immobilized, and small ones may be bankrupted, because insurers
have said they do not intend to cover losses from the explosion,
defining the blast as force majeure, an act of God.
</P>
<P>
   One barrier to reconstruction may be the president, Daniel arap
Moi.
</P>
<P>
   Moi, who has been in power for 21 years and whose ruling circle
is widely viewed as corrupt, toured the site of the blast Wednesday
and, for one of the few times in his presidency, took questions
from the press. He said it would take at least $500 million just to
repair the damage.
</P>
<P>
   The figure may have been plucked from the air but it represents
some complicated problems for Moi, who is perceived as having
looted his nation's treasury. Kenya has been ranked as the world's
third-most-corrupt nation, after Pakistan and Nigeria, by
Transparency International, an anti-corruption organization.
Several large financial institutions have collapsed in Kenya in
recent years, destabilized by bad debts from shady government
deals.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw, the economist, who is also a member of the political
opposition, said that all of this made it difficult to imagine that
the United States, or the International Monetary Fund, which
suspended aid to Kenya a year ago because of corruption, would
contribute much new help without strict guarantees that the money
would go into something other than a presidential bank account.
</P>
<P>
   ``How are we going to approach this reconstruction?'' he said.
``Will it be a presidential fund without accountability? A pot of
money from donors that goes into government budgets? Or will we set
up systems so that the money actually goes in and you get something
out of it?''
</P>
<P>
   The image of the United States also was damaged in the past
week. People are talking about how Israeli rescuers clambered over
the rubble of the Ufundi House searching for victims while marines
clutched their weapons, guarding the mission rather than joining
the search. A few are even saying the embassy should be closed,
leaving the Americans to fight their battles elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The State Department lifted a warning Friday that advised
against travel to Kenya, but thousands of Americans and Europeans
have probably tossed away their brochures for safaris and seaside
vacations by now, and one tourism official predicted that the
impact on the industry would be ``horrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Tourism, already damaged by accounts of crime in the capital and
at resorts, has constituted roughly 10 percent of the Kenyan
economy, and brought in 20 percent of its foreign exchange, while
providing better-paying jobs for thousands of people.
</P>
<P>
   The disaster assures that the economy will not grow this year,
according to several economic analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Kenya has had its share of hardship in recent years _ a corrupt
leadership, climate changes blamed on El Nino that have killed
crops, and ethnic clashes among tribes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economy is in terrible shape, tourism has been devastated
and now this,'' said Tim Vaulkhard, an architect whose company
designed some of the buildings damaged in the blast. But he added,
``Maybe this will be the catalyst to get Kenyans pulling together
again.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some good can come from the carnage, Imanyara, the
opposition politician, said. ``I've never seen Kenyans so united,''
he said. ``This is what it took to see ourselves as a nation.''
That unity has taken several forms. When President Moi toured the
wreckage this week, he was accompanied by the leaders of the
political opposition. No one here can recall him ever appearing in
public with any of them before.
</P>
<P>
   And while ethnic conflicts have taken a toll, and tribal
differences play out among politicians, there is a measure of
tolerance in Kenyan society that may promote healing. Even though
it is widely thought that the perpetrators were Arabs and Islamic
fundamentalists, Kenya's Muslim leaders say they have not felt a
backlash from their neighbors, whether civilian or police.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally, it has been good,'' Hammad Mohammed Kassin, a judge
in the Islamic courts, said during prayers Friday at Nairobi's main
mosque, which was rattled by the blast. ``There have only been one
or two incidents,'' he said, involving women in Muslim dresses
dragged off buses.
</P>
<P>
   Kenyans know that the Muslims of the country could never do such
a thing, the judge said.
</P>
<P>
   Imanyara said: ``It's ironic that it would take the death of
more than 200 Kenyans to wipe out our ethnic and racial prejudices,
that this horror had the effect of making Kenyans think as Kenyans.
It removed barriers among tribes. And this makes people see
themselves as all equal. It brings us closer.''
</P>
<P>
   Thinking of Gloria and Caroline Mutuiri, who were friends of his
son, he said: ``When I realize those kids are dead, I know at the
end of the day we must live as human beings, without barriers to
our common humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   In Uhuru Park, among the names of the dead, Ms. Karugi said much
the same. In pulling people from the wreckage, and caring for the
wounded, ``we did not mind the tribes, the kind of people'' being
taken care of, she said. ``We were Kenyans. We did not have any
boundaries.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   HEBRON, West Bank _ In the unrelenting heat of what has been an
unforgiving summer, water should spell relief.
</P>
<P>
   But in this city of 200,000, most taps ran dry a month ago, just
as record temperatures took hold, soaring day after day to nearly
100 degrees. That would have spelled misery anywhere, but what has
made it worse on the West Bank is that Palestinians cannot help but
notice that they are the only ones so parched.
</P>
<P>
   There is no sign of a water shortage in the Jewish settlements
just outside Hebron. There and in Israel as a whole, residents
still water lawns and wash their cars. Yet most water for the
Palestinians still flows through Israeli pipes, and by the time it
gets to cities like Hebron these days, there is barely a trickle
left.
</P>
<P>
   It was only 18 months ago that the Palestinians celebrated an
agreement that brought Hebron under their control, making it the
last of seven West Bank cities to come under Palestinian self-rule.
This summer, with cisterns empty, showers a luxury and fresh
laundry a distant dream, many are learning basic lessons about the
limitations of an incomplete peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't clean; we don't wash our clothes; we don't use the
water for anything but drinking,'' said Jibrin Kaffrawi, a
32-year-old electrician, who had embarked with his wife and seven
children on a quest for water at almost any price. ``But still
there is not enough to go around, because it is all in the hands of
the Jews.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel still controls nearly all the water resources in the West
Bank, including three enormous aquifers, just as it did during
years of direct rule when it occupied all of the territory. Simply
to dig a new well is prohibited unless a Palestinian can first
negotiate a host of political and technical restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   The extent to which the Palestinians will acquire water rights
is supposed to be part of a final peace settlement. Until then,
access to most fresh water is governed by a 1995 agreement that
requires Israel to make available a fixed amount of water _
slightly over 1 billion cubic feet a year _ to meet the
Palestinians' ``immediate needs.''
</P>
<P>
   That arrangement leaves big gaps. It provides the average
Palestinian less than one-third as much water as the average
Israeli _ and less than half of what Palestinian experts say the
people need. And it does nothing to prevent those gaps from growing
wider in the heat of summer, as Israeli authorities juggle the flow
in order to meet their own customers' surging demands.
</P>
<P>
   Add to that a heat wave that has made this the hottest summer in
more than three decades in the Middle East, and the effect is
stark.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a city in suffering,'' said Emad Azir, the water
commissioner in Hebron, the hardest hit of the Palestinian cities.
It has imposed a rationing system permitting households running
water no more than once every 15 days.
</P>
<P>
   The reason, Azir said, is that the amount of water Israel
supplies to Hebron has declined to its lowest level in memory _
about 176,500 cubic feet a day, less than half the supply during
the rainy months of winter.
</P>
<P>
   On the rare occasions when the supply is turned on, every spigot
is opened wide, in order to replenish every vessel within reach.
Other times, there is little option but to forage, either at a
nearby spring, where the water is of dubious quality, or by paying
an exorbitant price to a well-connected merchant able to arrange a
private delivery.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Even those who are relatively well off say the shortage has
forced an uncomfortable change in their summertime habits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your whole life style changes,'' said Hamza Aweiwi, 26, a shoe
salesman and newlywed who said that he and his wife had not had
running water since their wedding July 17. ``I've bought new tanks
for the roof, and paid a lot to fill them, but I can only dream of
the days when I used to take two showers.''
</P>
<P>
   As in most matters that divide Israelis and Palestinians, each
side blames the other.
</P>
<P>
   Meir Ben Meir, Israel's water commissioner, contended in an
interview that Israel is providing 15 percent more water to the
Palestinians than required under the 1995 accord. If Palestinians
need more water, Ben Meir said, the solution is not to take it away
from the Israelis, but for the Palestinians to exploit new sources,
such as desalinization.
</P>
<P>
   But Fadel Kawash, the Palestinian water commissioner for the
West Bank, accused Israel of failing to carry out promises to
increase some water allocations, and of dragging its feet on
Palestinian requests to dig exploratory wells, which he said were
more economical than desalinization.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main reason for this water is the Israelis,'' Kawash said.
``A drop of water is the basis for living, and without it there can
be no development and no peace.''

GIRL, 9, WINS $7.5 MILLION FOR AMUSEMENT RIDE INJURY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDITH GAINES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; In one of the nation's largest settlements for a case of its
kind, &UR;  &LR; a 9-year-old girl won an agreement Friday that will pay $7.5
million during her lifetime for scalp injuries suffered on a
children's amusement ride.
</P>
<P>
   The out-of-court settlement means that Danielle Foti, a
fifth-grader from East Bridgewater, Mass., ``will be well taken
care of for the rest of her life,'' said her mother, Karen Foti,
40. She described the family as thrilled by the agreement with
Bonkers 19, the now-defunct company that ran the indoor amusement
park, and Zamperla Inc., which purchased and distributed the
Mini-Himalaya ride that caused Danielle's injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hoping that some owners of these rides will look at the
size of the settlement and say, `Maybe these rides aren't as safe
as they should be, and maybe we should spend a few dollars to make
them safer,''' Foti said. ``We don't want anyone to go through the
hell we've been through.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Jerry Ellis, president of the Building 19 company that
owned Bonkers 19, nor Paul White, the company's lawyer, could be
reached Friday.
</P>
<P>
   David Daly, a lawyer with the firm of Daly, Kehoe &AMP; Crosson,
which represented Zamperla Inc., did not return phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 14, 1996, Danielle and a girlfriend, Valentina
Espinola, strapped themselves into the 14-car sled ride at the
little Bonkers 19 amusement park in Weymouth, Mass. They were
celebrating their 8th birthdays together.
</P>
<P>
   But while her mother looked on in horror, Danielle's long brown
hair caught in the motor behind her seat. ``It pulled her head
through the fiberglass seat and into the motor, which continued to
grind and tore her scalp off the right side of her head,'' said the
Fotis's lawyer, John Dalimonte, with the Boston firm of Karon &AMP;
Dalimonte.
</P>
<P>
   It was not until Espinola stood up in the moving car and
screamed for help that operators finally stopped the ride,
Dalimonte said. ``Danielle's friend was a brave little girl,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bonkers 19 closed as a result of the bad publicity that followed
the accident.
</P>
<P>
   Now after four surgeries and twelve 12 saline injections to
expand what remains of her scalp, Danielle is doing as well as can
be expected, her mother said. She still is a straight-A student who
likes math, horses, swings, bike riding, and collecting Beanie
Babies.
</P>
<P>
   But ``she's not half as outgoing as she used to be. She's much
less trusting of machinery _ and life,'' Foti said.
</P>
<P>
   The girl is self-conscious about a scar, about 10 inches long
and 3 inches wide, that goes from the front to the back of the
right side of her head. And although therapy has helped to ease the
trauma, she still has nightmares and painful memories.
</P>
<P>
   In one recurring memory, Dalimonte said, ``she's playing or
doing something fun, something a child would think would be safe,
like talking to a clown, when all of a sudden the clown turns into
a wolf that attacks her.'' Foti said, ``And she asks a lot of
questions about death now that never came up before.''
</P>
<P>
   The settlement means that the family, and especially Danielle,
will not have to relive the tragedy in court. It also means
Danielle will receive the $7.5 million tax-free, including $30,000
annually during her college years to cover tuition costs and $5,000
a year for medical expenses every year of her life.
</P>
<P>
   According to Dalimonte, resolution of similar cases yielded
$1.25 million and $950,000, respectively, for women in Illinois and
Maryland, both of whom sustained scalp injuries when their hair
caught in drill presses.
</P>
<P>
   About three months before the Foti accident, another
Massachusetts child, 4-year-old Karley Logan, was injured on the
same Mini-Himalaya ride when her foot got caught beneath one of the
sled-like cars. A settlement in that case is being negotiated.

   BIG OIL &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A British Amoco &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the biggest foreign takeover ever of an American company,
British Petroleum announced that it would buy Amoco (the name once
stood for American Oil Company) for $48.2 billion, eclipsing
Daimler-Benz's $40.5 billion deal for Chrysler.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, subject to regulatory and shareholder approval,
would create the world's third-largest multinational oil company in
net income, after Exxon and Royal Dutch/Shell. The combination is
expected to create a formidable competitor.
</P>
<P>
   B.P. is known for its skill at finding oil in the North Sea and
elsewhere around the world, while Amoco's strength is in refining
its products into oil and chemicals and distributing them to
consumers. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BELL ATLANTIC &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Score One for Workers &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Proclaiming victory, 73,000 members of the Communications
Workers of America ended a two-day strike and returned to work at
Bell Atlantic. The company, which serves telephone customers from
Maine to Virginia, agreed to guarantee job security to its union
workers _ even in digital technologies only now being developed.
</P>
<P>
   Experts in labor relations called it a significant union
victory. Kate Bronfenbrenner, director of labor education research
at Cornell University, said workers in other industries were likely
to be inspired by Bell Atlantic's agreement to phase out a nonunion
customer service operation in Virginia. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE RUSSIAN BEAR &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mauling the Market &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Given the way markets are performing in Moscow, Lenin's views on
capitalism might look prescient. The main stock market index has
plunged nearly 50 percent in four weeks, and the market was
temporarily closed on Thursday as sellers swamped buyers; it ended
the day with a loss of 6.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Yields on short-term Russian bonds exceeded 300 percent. George
Soros, the international financier, called for sweeping financial
changes and a devaluation of the ruble by 15 percent to 25 percent,
a move the government has insisted it will not make.
</P>
<P>
   In neighboring Belarus, where the local money is known as the
zaichik, or bunny, the government will no longer accept its own
currency as payment for exports. The bunny has lost half its value
in five months. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   STOCKS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Global Tremors &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No man is an island, as John Donne observed, and neither is any
market. Stocks were battered on Wall Street and in Western Europe
as investors _ particularly big institutional traders _ worried
about the worldwide effects on corporate earnings of Asia's
financial crises, the Japanese yen's tumble to an eight-year low
and Russia's ravaged markets. The Dow Jones industrial average
closed at 8,425.00, down 173.02 for the week, and with
small-company stocks hit even harder, the NASDAQ index ended at
1,790.19, down 56.58 points. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   GEOCITIES &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Going Public, Keeping Private &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Investors clamored to buy the stock of Geocities, which gives
its two million members their own pages on the World Wide Web to
display pictures of their offspring, their pets or whatever strikes
their fancy _ a business on which it has not proved it can make
money.
</P>
<P>
   It went public on Tuesday at $17, and the shares more than
doubled that day to close at $37.3125. But two days later, the
company ran afoul of the Federal Trade Commission.
</P>
<P>
   In the government's first Internet-privacy enforcement action,
the commission said Geocities had lied when it told subscribers,
both adults and children, that it would not disclose personal
information it collected from them.
</P>
<P>
   Settling the matter without admitting wrongdoing, Geocities
posted a new privacy statement explaining how it uses the
information it collects. The stock ended the week at $37.35. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE ECONOMY &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   GM Strikes Take a Toll &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The productivity of American workers fell in the second quarter
at an annual rate of 0.2 percent after surging at a rate of 3.5
percent in the first three months of the year. The drop, the first
in three years, was attributed to the effects of Asia's economic
crisis and to UAW strikes that virtually shut down General Motors
plants for up to two months.
</P>
<P>
   Those strikes also depressed retail sales, which the Commerce
Department said fell 0.4 percent in July. Excluding automobiles,
sales rose for the sixth time in seven months. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DROUGHT &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A Ravaged Cotton Crop &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Texans and Oklahomans like to refer to their part of the world
as God's country. After a 100-degree summer and drought that has
cracked the red clay soil, a visitor could be forgiven for thinking
its patronage resides elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the cotton crop has been burned up, and livestock has
been liquidated. Texas officials estimate that the drought will
cost farmers and ranchers $1.8 billion and will drain $4.9 billion
from the state's economy.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Howard, Oklahoma's agriculture commissioner, said, ``The
ag dollar goes around Main Street six, seven, eight times, but it's
not going around now, because it's not there.''
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the Agriculture Department said, the cotton crop
will be down 24 percent from last year. If there is a silver lining
for the two states, it is that their economies are far more
diversified and industrial than they were during the Dust Bowl of
the 1930s. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   HMOs &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mismanaged Care? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators reported that health maintenance
organizations have billed the government for administrative costs
related to their private customers, bringing them more than $1
billion a year in overpayments from the Medicare trust fund. ... In
New York, the State Insurance Department asked Oxford Health Plans
to increase its reserves for its New York plan by $152 million to
insure that it could pay claims over the next year.
</P>
<P>
   The company reported a loss of $507.6 million for the second
quarter. ... United Healthcare's $5.5 billion acquisition of its
rival, Humana, collapsed after the value of United's stock fell
$2.9 billion earlier this month. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FORD &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lower Prices for '99 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ford Motor, the No. 2 auto maker, announced that it would cut
prices across the board for the first time in more than 30 years.
The decrease, which will affect 1999 model cars and trucks,
averages 0.3 percent, or about $61, from comparably equipped 1998
models. But the prices of Ford's highest-volume cars, the Ford
Taurus and Mercury Sable, will fall by $1,000 to $1,800. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LIVENT &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Brouhaha on Broadway &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Creativity is a big asset to a Broadway producer _ but creative
accounting is not. Livent Inc., the producer of ``Ragtime'' and
``Show Boat,'' said an internal investigation had found serious
accounting problems involving millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The company, now led by Michael Ovitz, the former Hollywood
power broker, said its financial results would almost certainly
have to be restated, and after an emergency board meeting in
Toronto, it suspended Garth H. Drabinsky, the impresario who built
the company and serves as chief creative director. Two executives
said he kept two sets of books to conceal extravagant spending. He
denied it. &QL;

STABLES FIT FOR A KING: SPLENDOR IN THE BLUEGRASS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 16) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ky., Calif.)   (af)  
 By SASHA CAVENDER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   VERSAILLES, Ky. _ In the Bluegrass, in the heart of central
Kentucky, some horses live better than most people, in barns that
look like castles or cathedrals, with spires and cupolas,
stained-glass windows and garden sculpture, chandeliers and
hand-forged gates.
</P>
<P>
   From their straw-banked stalls, the horses have views of some of
the finest real estate in the world: rolling emerald hills etched
with Kentucky's famous four-board fences _ white or black _
following the landscape like reels of satin ribbons winding uphill
and down dale.
</P>
<P>
   At one farm alone, the views include swan ponds, fishing lakes
and 800 rose bushes. These estates seem like countries, not country
farms.
</P>
<P>
   Horses are to Kentucky what cars are to Detroit, or corn to Iowa
_ a multibillion-dollar business. The horses themselves are
captains of industry; some are worth tens of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stallions are arguably the single most valuable property the
farm has,'' said Eric Shaffer, the architect for Gainsborough Farm
here, which was named for the original in England and is owned by
Sheik Maktoum al-Maktoum, the eldest of four royal brothers of the
United Arab Emirates. Thus, he said, ``you want to show off the
horse in the best light and best setting.''
</P>
<P>
   Breeding top sires to top mares is where the money is. Fabulous
sums are paid for unknown risks: A stud fee of $100,000 to $200,000
(prices rise and fall, as in the stock market) may get a mare a
single mating with a legendary sire but will not always guarantee a
live foal.
</P>
<P>
   Called the sport of kings, horse racing is also the maker and
breaker of fortunes. Its devotees say that the passion for
thoroughbreds transcends mere financial considerations; still, it
devours money _ $500,000 here, $10 million there.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1980s, prices scraped the sky at Keeneland's July
Sales in Lexington, the premier annual auction of horseflesh that
commands the attention of horse owners around the world. Yearlings
sold for as much as $13 million in international bidding among
Arab, British, American and Japanese buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Prime land sold for $10,000 an acre. Sales parties matched the
prices, with elephant rides, hot-air balloons, and dinners cooked
by Wolfgang Puck.
</P>
<P>
   In time, the market _ and its colossal prices _ fell. Tax laws
changed, hammering the industry. The circus animals and calliope
music faded. Banks called in loans; farms flooded the market. ``It
bottomed out in '91,'' said Joe Riddell, a Bluegrass horse-farm
broker. ``The same land sold for just $4,000 an acre. Now, it's
going up again.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, even as Asia's financial crisis has diminished the
presence of Japanese bidders, new wealth from high-technology
entrepreneurs and the growing international horse business have
kept the Bluegrass busy.
</P>
<P>
   The top bid for a colt last month was $4 million _ the first
time in seven years that it had surpassed $2 million. And prime
land is now commanding $6,000 or more an acre, Riddell said, ``with
no structures, no fence.'' Serious horse farms range from 600 to
3,000 acres, with 1,200 the average.
</P>
<P>
   To Riddell, a former farm manager himself, ``the grandeur is up
to someone's ego; how deep is your pocket?''
</P>
<P>
   ``A stall is a stall,'' he added. ``How much does a horse care?
He's not going to be running in it; he just stands in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the stunning design details serve functional purposes.
Cupolas, for example, were originally put on barns for ventilation
and light; they create a chimney effect, pulling up air. The
fresher the air, the fewer the bacteria and the healthier the
horses.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There are business considerations, too. Dan Rosenberg, manager
of the Three Chimneys Farm, home of Seattle Slew, the Triple Crown
winner in 1977, said beauty was worth the investment _ ``to attract
prospective clients.''
</P>
<P>
   The farm's stallion barns are ``designed to be safe and healthy
for the horses and efficient from a labor standpoint,'' he said,
``but also to be a sales tool.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Here's where we're going to put the horse' says something to
the owner,'' Rosenberg said. ``To prospective breeders, it's
atmosphere, image and aura you're trying to promote.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen E. Paulson would agree. He is the founder of Gulfstream
Aerospace and a leading breeder of thoroughbreds, among them Cigar,
the two-time Horse of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   He has spent more than $150 million on horses. ``I look at it
like digging oil wells,'' he said from his office in Del Mar,
Calif. ``If you dig just a few, forget it.''
</P>
<P>
   He has three Brookside farms _ in California, in Florida and in
Versailles (pronounced ver-SALES). His 1,400-acre farm here is one
of the area's prettiest, with 20 three-spired barns, painted snow
white with hydrangea blue trim. The main house was built in 1790;
Paulson supervised its renovation.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't stint on the stables, either, selecting crystal
chandeliers for all the barns. With three cupolas in each barn,
that's 60 chandeliers. At night, they light up the landscape. Asked
if the farm's design reflected his taste, Paulson said wryly, ``I
had some influence.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An exception to the owner-as-designer rule is Gainsborough,
perhaps the most lavish Bluegrass farm. It is a product of a
collaboration between the farm manager, Allen Kershaw, and Shaffer,
a Lexington architect. ``My marching orders,'' Kershaw said of
Sheik Maktoum's instructions, ``were to create a first-class
operation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Once I decided on the octagonal shape, everything followed
from that,'' Shaffer said. Eight-sided cupolas show off
stained-glass windows with Gainsborough's jockey silks of royal
blue. Geometry is everywhere, from stall windows to fountains to
footpaths.
</P>
<P>
   ``At night, the barns almost glow,'' he said. ``With the lights
reflecting off the lake, the cupolas and windows are
transformed.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kershaw, a former architecture student, said beauty was fine but
that function came first: Farms need healthy horses. ``You don't
turn the horses off like the fax machine when you go home; they're
a constant responsibility, 24 hours a day,'' he said. ``We make the
surroundings detail-oriented so the grooms and managers are into
it, and so injuries and sickness in the horses don't get missed.''
</P>
<P>
   As for costs, Kershaw said, ``the expensive part is what you
don't see _ the infrastructure.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We use water from our own lake and wells, the roads,
electricity all hidden underground; security, fire safety,'' he
added. ``I have people I send to water school.''
</P>
<P>
   Gainsborough visitors seem to love it all: the waterfalls, the
sky-lit barns of sculpted wood, the no-expense-spared details.
</P>
<P>
   Beautiful barns ripple across the Bluegrass hills. Gainesway's
magnificence evokes Tuscany, Hill 'N Dale's brick courtyard looks
like a grand English country estate, and the cavernous stone barns
at Ashford Stud are the work of 21 stonemasons. No wonder visitors
might want to swap places with the horses.
</P>
<P>
   Riddell recalled how expenses rose past $920,000 for a barn at
the Adena Springs farm. He told Frank Stronach, the owner, that of
the costs, ``$120,000 is for the horses, the rest is for you.'' The
cedar-and-stone barn had been Stronach's dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me, `That's fine. Let's build it,' '' Riddell said. So
they did.

 &HT;    PGA NOTEBOOK: Andrade continues on-again, off-again play
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDMOND, Wash. _ Barely in the Pacific Northwest for 24 hours
Thursday after securing a spot as the eighth alternate, Billy
Andrade birdied the first four holes at Sahalee Country Club and
registered a surprising 68, tying for second place.
</P>
<P>
   So much for happy hour.
</P>
<P>
   Friday the Atlanta resident returned to the spottier play that
has typified a frustrating season. He required 77 shots to tour
Sahalee in the second round and finished dangerously close to the
cut line.
</P>
<P>
   ''As far as it catching up with me, I don't think it was that at
all,'' Andrade said. ''I think that's bull. I just didn't play that
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Putts that found the hole Thursday weren't cooperating Friday. A
four-footer for birdie that would have settled Andrade to 1-over
for the tournament missed at the 15th. An hour later, Andrade had
lost three shots to par with a double-bogey at the 16th and bogeyed
the unyielding, arguably unfair 475-yard 18th.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm frustrated,'' said Andrade, who stands 108th on the money
list ($181,391) after finishing 31st ($665,602) last year. ''I'm
just having a tough year. It seems like when I need a birdie putt,
I don't make it. When I need to hit a good drive, I hit it in the
rough.''
</P>
<P>
   Keppler fails to make weekend
</P>
<P>
   Summit Chase pro Stephen Keppler, the Georgia PGA Section's lone
representative at Sahalee, settled for a 6-over-par 76 Friday and
failed to make weekend play at 149. Keppler allowed three
double-bogeys, consecutively on No.4 and No. 5, and then also on
the 18th, catching the lip of a bunker ''and moving the ball about
10 feet.'' The good news? Keppler need not rush to Brunswick for
Monday's start of the Georgia Open. ''I played about the same today
as yesterday (a 73),'' said the Suwanee resident. ''I just couldn't
avoid the doubles. . .Columbus' Larry Mize followed his 75 with a
71, but also missed the cut.
</P>
<P>
   Couples regrets poor preparation
</P>
<P>
   Seattle native Fred Couples, who improved to a 71 after
Thursday's 75, said he felt no extra pressure from the local
attention. ''It's only frustrating that I didn't practice a lot
harder before I got up here,'' said Couples. ''I don't want to make
it sound like I wanted to play poorly, but I relaxed the last
couple of months.'' . . . Stuart Appleby shot 10-over 150 with a 73
Friday, failing to make the cut in his first appearance since the
death of his wife Renay July 23. ''I'm not expecting great
things,'' Appleby said. ''Ninety percent of the game is mental, and
if you're not mentally fit, you're not going to play your quality
shots.''.. . .1995 champion Steve Elkington, having battled viral
meningitis and sinus surgery in recent months, is an unexpected
contender at 2-under 138 after a 69 Friday. ''I'm due for some good
luck and some good golf,'' he said. ''I feel great. I'm close to
100 percent.'' . . .After an opening 80, John Daly improved to a
72, but missed the cut for the fourth time in five years. Since
winning the 1991 PGA, Daly has finished 82nd, tied for 51st, tied
for 29th and missed four cuts.

   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ busy they are.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heck, they say El Nino is the cause of everything these
days,'' Besheer said. ``I don't know if that's the case here, but
it's buggier. Plus, the economy's good and the Kansas City area's
growing, so there are just more jobs out there.''
</P>
<P>
   This summer, in particular, the tight labor market and strong
economy combined to put a lot more people to work. The number of
employed youth nationally, for example, increased by 2.8 million
from April to July.
</P>
<P>
   Youth employment always rises in the summer, but this year the
number of unemployed youth rose far less than usual, indicating
more jobs were available and filled by those who wanted them.
</P>
<P>
   Stock market activity, for two summers in a row, also has
remained hot.
</P>
<P>
   ``The constant, overwhelming amount of things people have on
their plates has taken away the ability to notice it's summer,''
counselor Rosen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doldrums, if any, seem to have moved to January and
February, not July and August. People are saying now that they're
so busy they can't stop to feel how they feel.''

PUSH COMES TO SHOVE ON MEDICARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: Some things don't make sense _ the revelation, for
instance, of a federal investigation showing that health
maintenance organizations benefit from Medicare overpayments
exceeding $1 billion annually.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, according to federal investigators, is ``highly
inflated'' administrative costs.HMOs aren't paying their ``fair
share'' of these costs, and government should attempt to recover
the excess payments, according to the report from the inspector
general of the Department of Health and Human Services.
</P>
<P>
   Tell that to stockholders of United Healthcare Corp. The company
bid to acquire rival Humana came a cropper after a collapse of
United Healthcare stock that gave shareholders a haircut of nearly
$3 billion. The plunge partly resulted from United's decision to
reduce company Medicare involvement due to losses.
</P>
<P>
   That came after United took an unexpected $900 million
second-quarter charge, which some analysts fear may be only the
first of more unpleasant surprises to come.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond United Healthcare's Medicare-related problems, The Wall
Street Journal also reported this week that some other Medicare
HMOs are making radical adjustments to cope with a continuing
financial squeeze. Soaring drug prices combined with Medicare
belt-tightening has resulted in management miscalculations that
will cause other HMOs to both reduce Medicare exposure and trim
benefits for remaining clients.
</P>
<P>
   One key problem, it appears, is prescription drugs. Traditional
Medicare doesn't cover this cost, and one of the primary
attractions of the Medicare HMO was coverage for prescriptions
either entirely or up to a generous threshold. About 15 percent of
all Medicare enrollees currently belong to HMOs, and Washington
plans initiatives to double that participation rate in the next few
years.
</P>
<P>
   This aggressive move to encourage HMO enrollment may be at odds
with Medicare's financial situation. As the program's finances
become more strained, the need to control costs will intensify.
Since HMOs are paid a capitation fee for each enrollee, rising
patient demands for benefits and costs of medical care will
inevitably collide with Medicare's relentless need to economize.
</P>
<P>
   Unless a solution is found to resolve conflicting economic
goals, Medicare's experiment with the HMO concept may fail. This
likely would be devastating to the long-term prospects for Medicare
because the HMO is the last, best hope to keep the program viable
for generations to come.
</P>
<P>
   As corporations have found, managed care _ warts and all _ is
the only way to keep health-care coverage costs within reasonable
limits. Uncle Sam's access to taxpayer resources gives government
relatively more breathing room, but the public's capacity to pay
enough taxes to underwrite limitless access to care isn't infinite.
</P>
<P>
   As for government's claim that HMOs are using government as a
cash cow to ease administrative costs, there seems much room for
debate. The inspector general charged that many HMOs profit
excessively from Medicare. The reality would seem to suggest that
Medicare has become more a daunting bottom-line challenge than a
source of easy profits for the health-care providers and insurers
involved in the actual marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever the truth lies in this issue, one thing is obvious.
Government has just as much incentive as the private sector to
watch its pennies, and all Medicare beneficiaries will bear the
consequences.

ANALYSIS: DESPITE UPS AND DOWNS, ECONOMY NOT LIKELY TO UNRAVEL
ANYTIME SOON  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By SYLVIA NASAR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With Russia facing financial turmoil, Asia sinking deeper into
recession the president fighting for his political life and the
stock market swooning, the blindingly bright economic picture of
the last couple of years suddenly looks murkier.
</P>
<P>
   What makes things a bit scary is that the economy has already
shifted into slower gear, and slowdowns _ which make it harder for
businesses and consumers to shrug off random blows _ have a way of
turning into recessions. ``Things can pile up,'' said June O'Neill,
director of the Congressional Budget Office. ``They can unravel as
quickly as they materialize.''
</P>
<P>
   But the economy is not likely to unravel anytime soon.
Forecasters are counting on low inflation, falling interest rates
and confident consumers to keep growth going in the year's second
half. They are taking last month's news about a slide in everything
from industrial production to retail sales _ all made worse by the
General Motors strike _ in stride.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a slowdown, they say, is just what the doctor ordered.
``The domestic economy is still very sound,'' said Mickey Levy,
chief economist at NationsBanc Montgomery Securities. ``I see it
moderating from a robust to a sustainable place.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Chip consensus of 50 economic forecasters sees growth
just shy of a 2.4 percent annual rate for the second half of the
year and more of the same next year. That would not be as heady as
the average 4 percent growth rate of last year and earlier this
year. But it is considered fast enough to keep unemployment near
its 28-year low of 4.5 percent, without being so fast as to
intensify inflationary pressures or invite interest rate increases
by the Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Not a single Blue Chip economist sees a recession beginning in
the second half. ``Asia has slowed the economy,'' said Bruce
Steinberg, chief economist at Merrill Lynch, ``but its only
intrinsic problem is a shortage of workers.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the risks to this essentially benign outlook are numerous
and real, economists admit. A disaster in one area or a combination
of mini- disasters could darken the economic picture. Apart from
bolts from the blue like a military confrontation with Iraq or
natural disasters, Asia's woes could worsen sharply, reducing U.S.
exports still further, deepening the downturn in manufacturing and
hammering corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
   The political crisis surrounding the presidency could paralyze
the economy, just as, in some analysts' eyes, Watergate may have
deepened and prolonged the severe recession of 1973-75.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a stock market rout could shake consumers' confidence
and wreak havoc on household balance sheets, causing spending to
collapse and inventories to pile up. In 1990, Saddam Hussein's
attack on Kuwait and surging oil prices frightened consumers badly
enough to tip the economy into recession.
</P>
<P>
   Like the special effects in the movie ``Armageddon,'' the nasty
hypothetical possibilities are so palpable that it is easy to
forget the economy's strengths. Momentum, for example. Sturdy
consumer and business spending will probably offset a further
deterioration in the trade deficit, a decline already built into
most forecasts for the second half. The side effects of the Asian
crisis _ the stronger dollar, lower interest rates and cheaper raw
materials _ are actually bolstering the purchasing power of
American consumers and businesses and lifting the profits of many
companies in finance, transportation, services and consumer goods.
</P>
<P>
   Analogies between Monicagate and Watergate fail to take into
account the impact of Richard Nixon's economic policies and his bad
economic luck, as Larry Kudlow, the chief economist at Skandia,
points out. Long before Nixon resigned the presidency in August
1974, inflation was spiraling out of control, the dollar was
sliding and oil prices were soaring.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While a sudden, sharp stock market decline _ two or three times
the recent 10 percent drop _ would almost certainly affect
consumers, there is no reason to believe they would head for the
hills, especially since the Federal Reserve would surely push
interest rates down to cushion the blow and encourage spending.
</P>
<P>
   Though the fallout from the recently settled GM strike has made
it hard to see clearly, consumers and businesses are still spending
at a steady pace.
</P>
<P>
   Business investment, which surged at a 26 percent annual rate in
the year's first half, is bound to slow, but not necessarily to a
crawl. Total corporate profits have flattened in recent quarters as
companies in such fields as high technology, energy and machinery
have seen sharp declines. Still, many companies in the service
sector are still enjoying double-digit gains. Overall profit
margins remain close to historic highs. Productivity is up nearly 2
percent from a year ago, and wage costs, while drifting higher,
show no signs of taking off. Cash flow _ a measure of businesses'
ability to finance capital spending _ is strong. ``The fundamentals
for capital spending are still pretty good,'' said Richard Rippe,
chief economist at Prudential Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Barring a sudden collapse in demand, there is little reason to
expect that business will stop replenishing inventories. Stockpiles
look fairly lean relative to sales. Much of last winter's big
pileup, when inventory accumulation hit a record $91 billion, has
already been whittled away.
</P>
<P>
   As with business spending, consumer spending, which spurted at a
torrid 6 percent annual rate in the first half, is bound to
moderate. But the latest readings from the nation's malls show
that, sales of big-ticket items other than cars were up smartly in
June. Consumers are not stinting on services either; so many
consumers are traveling that airlines are once again raising fares,
for example.
</P>
<P>
   With consumer net worth $12 trillion higher than just four years
ago, courtesy of the stock market, and consumers more willing to
use their capital gains than ever before, consumers have been
spending virtually everything they make and saving almost nothing.
But newfound wealth has not been the main prop of spending; jobs
are still plentiful and incomes are rising much faster than
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   So far, consumers have not been spooked by the latest stock
market gyrations. Confidence, which is close to historic highs,
seems to depend more on such factors as inflation, interest rates
and, most of all, job growth, says Richard Curtin, director of the
surveys of consumers at the University of Michigan. To the extent
that consumers worry about the Asian crisis, he said, it is because
they fear that it will result in layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the doubling of stock prices in the last two years has
dwarfed the recent declines, leaving consumers with strong gains.
The Dow Jones industrial average is still up 6.5 percent for the
year. ``Consumers will impart a degree of stability to the economy
that wouldn't be there if they reacted like traders,'' Curtin said.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the day, a lot of economists' confidence in the
economy reflects today's low inflation and zero budget deficits,
which leave policy makers considerable maneuvering room. ``In a
low-inflation environment, you have great flexibility for the
Federal Reserve to counter an excessively weak economy,'' points
out Rippe. During the economic slowdown in 1995, for example, the
Fed eased three times, and the economy rebounded.

PRODUCTIVITY RISE SHOWS HAZY, CRAZY DAYS OF SUMMER ARE NO LONGER
LAZY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Summer doldrums have gone the way of home
milk deliveries.
</P>
<P>
   These days are supposed to be the dog days of summer, yet
business continues to run at a feverish pace.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, air conditioning combats the effects of seasonal heat
for most workers. Plus, there are too many channels and not enough
free time to get bored.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more like the summer frenzies now,'' said Connie Russell,
a clinical social worker and career development coach.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics and individual observations both indicate that the
``lazy, hazy, crazy days of summer'' aren't lazy anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the Labor Department's productivity figures. In the
third quarter last year _ the period covering the summer months _
U.S. productivity gained markedly over the second, or spring,
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Productivity measures hourly output by American workers. Last
summer, it grew at the fastest pace in five years. This summer's
figure won't be known until later this fall, but analysts expect
continued growth.
</P>
<P>
   Data show that the average number of weekly on-the-job hours by
U.S. production workers doesn't drop during the summer, either.
Last August, for example, the average work week was 35 hours; in
July last year it was 34.9 hours. No other months that year had a
higher average.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Czaplewski, vice president-human resources at Missouri Gas
Energy, looked shocked when asked whether the summer doldrums had
set in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely not,'' Czaplewski said. ``In some ways, our
activity increases.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if the utility's phone centers aren't as busy handling
customer queries about their winter bills, other work, such as
training programs, fills summer days.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, workplaces frantically contend with employee
vacations. Summer, when kids are out of school, continues to be the
peak family vacation time.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are desperate for their vacations,'' said Robert Rosen,
a Kansas City counselor who works with people on life and career
issues. ``But they work harder before they leave to get ready to
go, and then there's tremendous anxiety when they come back and try
to catch up.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're draining their recharged batteries almost
immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   And the workers who aren't on vacation work doubletime to fill
in for absent colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, absenteeism doesn't rise in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   The Bureau of National Affairs Inc. tracks monthly unscheduled
absence rates. The research organization's line graph shows annual
peaks (more absences) between November and April and annual valleys
(fewer absences) between May and October.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, fewer workers play hooky to go fishing or take a
``dog days'' break.
</P>
<P>
   At the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics in Kansas City, regional
economist Dave McDermott is waiting to take his vacation this fall,
largely because his wife is too busy to leave her work.
</P>
<P>
   Jeannie McDermott is a children's librarian at Olathe (Kan.)
Public Library, where out-of-school children flood the story hours
and book stacks. The library _ like camps, movie theaters and video
rental shops _ rocks during the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many different kinds of entertainment available
now, the summer is spent running kids around,'' noted Russell, the
clinical social worker and career counselor at Centerpoint
Counseling and Recovery in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``My work didn't stop just because school was out,'' said Cathy
Bien, a Leawood, Kan., mother of four. ``Then their leisure time
was filled with more and more things, so I'm also shuttling them
around to all these structured activities.''
</P>
<P>
   The days of cloud-watching from a hilltop have been replaced by
swim meets, baseball practices, Scout camp, dance recitals and
birthday parties.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of summer boredom also is cut short by an early
return to school. Several area school districts start back to class
on Aug. 20, which still is in the thick of summertime.
</P>
<P>
   Sally Jadlow, a workplace chaplain for three area car
dealerships and four assisted living centers, finds that summer
heat makes some difference in work pace _ but not necessarily
attitudes _ of people who don't work in air conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the car dealerships, the pace slows down a bit back where
the mechanics are, especially toward the afternoon,'' she said.
Still, she said, ``they're real troupers'' about staying on task.
</P>
<P>
   And in the air-conditioned front offices, Jadlow doesn't see any
change in work pace or emotions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, when I go to the retirement homes, the residents
are sitting around with their sweaters on, complaining it's so cold
because of the air conditioning. They have to go sit outside on the
porch to get warm.''
</P>
<P>
   Indoor, climate-controlled work conditions combine with the
national, if not international, scope of business to make climate
immaterial at many workplaces.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pace of work and of change is so fast these days, it
doesn't seem like things slow down anywhere,'' said Leigh Branham,
vice president at Right Management Consultants in Overland Park,
Kan.
</P>
<P>
   Summer is prime time for corporate relocations, Branham added,
and all that inter-city and intra-company movement quickens the
pace.
</P>
<P>
   Seasonal work, such as construction, typically soars in the
summer. Of course, when it gets hot enough to sizzle roofing tar,
it's also too hot for workers to maintain an all-day, fast-working
pace.
</P>
<P>
   That's when extra water breaks or midday rest periods occur _
but that doesn't mean the amount of work lessens. Crews stay on the
job until the last tinge of sunlight or even work under lights at
night.
</P>
<P>
   And, as if busyness were contagious, even the bugs are more
active this summer. Jay Besheer, of Gunter Exterminating Co., said
the industry's talk nationally and locally is all about how busy
they are. MORE

SECRET EVIDENCE MAY BE THREAT TO SOME IMMIGRANTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Mich., Mass.)  (lb) 
 By RONALD SMOTHERS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are 25 immigrants in the United States who are facing
deportation or exclusion from the country largely on evidence that
they are not permitted to see and that comes from people who are
not identified.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government has defended the use of secret evidence
in these cases, which usually involve allegations of association
with terrorists, but not actual charges of terrorism. Government
officials argue that the only way to persuade people to give
information about terrorist activities is to offer the protection
of complete anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Cases that involve allegations derived from secret evidence are
just a tiny percentage of the more than 100,000 immigrant-status
cases that the Immigration and Naturalization Service deals with
every year, said agency officials.
</P>
<P>
   But all of those being held in these cases are of Arab descent
or are Muslims. To Hala Maksoud, president of the Arab-American
Anti-Discrimination Committee, this has the smell of ``human and
civil rights somehow being suspended when it comes to Muslims.''
</P>
<P>
   Russ Bergeron, a spokesman for the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, said that he could not comment on specific
cases or give the names of all 25 men involved in secret-evidence
cases.
</P>
<P>
   But Bergeron defended the use of secret evidence and cited the
approval of the practice under certain conditions by federal courts
over four decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``What essentially these courts have said is that the obligation
of the U.S. government to protect its citizens from threats at
times justifies a modification in the due process that will
normally be granted in judicial proceedings,'' Bergeron said.
</P>
<P>
   A senior U.S. intelligence official who spoke on condition of
anonymity said that it was not unusual for intelligence-gathering
agencies to provide information in immigration cases. He also
defended keeping secret the details of information provided, to
protect the informers and ``costly technical systems that took
years to develop,'' like satellite surveillance systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``These systems could be compromised by a disclosure that could
indicate the method of operation,'' said the official.
</P>
<P>
   The use of secret evidence is not new. The procedures have been
in place and validated by courts since the early 1950s, when
communism loomed as the perceived national-security threat.
</P>
<P>
   Today, when the fear is that Middle East terrorism will spill
over into the United States, the number of cases based on secret
evidence has increased, said immigration officials. There have been
50 cases since 1992, according to a February letter from Lori
Scialabba, the acting INS counsel at the time.
</P>
<P>
   One of those cases played out in Newark, N.J., last week, when a
man who has been held in jail since March had his day in court. He
says he believes that the only person accusing him of anything is
his former wife. But the names of his accusers are a secret.
</P>
<P>
   To the accused immigrants, many of whom have been held in
detention for up to two years awaiting the outcome of deportation
proceedings, and to their lawyers, this secret evidence _ a vague
summary of the secret data that never directly accuse the
immigrants of wrongdoing _ invites surreal literary comparisons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Kafkaesque,'' said James Woolsey, the former director of
the CIA and a lawyer who is part of a team representing six exiled
Iraqi opponents of Saddam Hussein. The six were among a group of
6,000 exiles brought to the United States in 1996 after their
CIA-supported efforts to undermine Saddam failed. They have been
detained for a year on the basis of secret evidence.
</P>
<P>
   For a time immigration officials would not let even Woolsey, who
continues to have the highest of security clearances, view the
secret data. INS officials later said this was a mistake and they
declassified nearly three-quarters of the material and provided
unclassified summaries of the rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was stunning,'' said Woolsey in a telephone interview.
Although he did not provide copies of the files, he said that much
of the so-called secret data turned out to be vague suspicions,
some the result of lies prompted by jealousies among the exiles and
some mistakes in translation during FBI interviews of the exiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something that would have been entirely appropriate in
Iraq,'' Woolsey said. ``But it is an outrage for the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   Noel Saleh, a Detroit immigration lawyer, said that his
experience was more reminiscent of Alice ``going through the
looking glass.'' His client, Imad Hamad _ a 35-year-old social
worker from Detroit who has lived in the United States since 1980
and is married to a citizen _ had to battle repeated efforts by
immigration officials to keep him from getting permanent residency.
</P>
<P>
   Starting with immigration court hearings in 1989, the INS began
brandishing FBI reports and photographs of Hamad participating in
demonstrations and fund-raising events for local Arab-American
groups and suggesting that he was a member of the Popular Front for
the Liberation of Palestine.
</P>
<P>
   But none of the proceedings, which continued off and on through
1993, resulted in a final deportation order.
</P>
<P>
   Then earlier this year INS officials said that they had secret
evidence. At first they withheld it from from Hamad and his lawyer
but showed it to the immigration court judge. The judge dismissed
it, saying that Hamad, a homeowner and father of three who was
married to a naturalized U.S. citizen was not a security risk. He
granted him permanent resident status.
</P>
<P>
   The INS is appealing this ruling, but in June it declassified
much of the secret evidence that it sought to use to bar Hamad.
</P>
<P>
   ``The things they said were secret evidence turned out to be the
same declassified stuff we saw from the FBI back in the 1989
hearing,'' said Saleh. ``What was declassified should never have
been classified in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   Myron Marlin, a Justice Department spokesman, said that the
court cases allowing the use of secret evidence have considered
grants of political asylum and other efforts for noncitizens as
``discretionary benefits and extraordinary acts of sovereign
generosity.''
</P>
<P>
   They are not rights, he said, and because they are
discretionary, national security or other considerations can be
brought to bear. The result is that in certain immigration
proceedings, noncitizens are not guaranteed the due process that
they would have in criminal cases.
</P>
<P>
   Although the courts have upheld the use of secret evidence in
immigration cases, the Justice Department, which oversees the INS
and the Executive Office of Immigration Review _ whose 200 judges
hear most immigration cases _ has recently acknowledged that some
changes may be in order.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   In meetings in June with a group complaining about the use of
secret evidence, Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder said that his
office would start reviewing all material used as secret evidence
in immigration cases. He also said the Justice Department would
re-evaluate the classified nature of some of the allegations in the
pending 25 cases and make it a practice to provide lawyers and
their clients with declassified summaries of the classified data.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, two U.S. senators are voicing concern because all
of the current cases using secret evidence are against people of
Arab descent or Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter last week to Attorney General Janet Reno and INS
Commissioner Doris Meissner, the two senators _ Spencer Abraham of
Michigan, the Republican chairman of the subcommittee on
immigration, and Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, the ranking
Democrat on the subcommittee _ said they had ``grave concerns''
about the fairness and due-process issues raised by the use of
secret evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some also believe that the recent actions create the
appearance that the INS may be using secret evidence only in cases
against Arab immigrants,'' the letter said. ``This is especially
disturbing since many of these cases appear to be based not on any
actions of the immigrants, but rather on their purported
associations.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate subcommittee is scheduled to hold hearings next month
on the INS and its detention practices.
</P>
<P>
   Louis Bograd, head of the prison project of the American Civil
Liberties Union and a member of the coalition, said that the
anti-terrorism act authorized the establishment of a new judicial
arm called ``alien terrorist removal courts,'' which would be
empowered to use secret evidence to deport suspected terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   But those courts, which have yet to be established, would allow
lawyers with security clearances to view the secret evidence and
permit judges to order fuller declassified summaries that could be
seen by the immigrant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think these protections are adequate, but they are
certainly better than what INS is now providing when it comes to
secret evidence,'' said Bograd, who represents Nasser Ahmed, a New
York man who has been held in prison for 27 months largely because
of secret evidence. ``If the government can use secret evidence
against resident aliens, then there is no real constitutional
impediment to using it against citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Woolsey disagreed somewhat, saying that there were situations in
which secret evidence could be used, but only with ``strict
safeguards.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not opposed to it completely as long as there are
procedures to share the information with counsel who have security
clearances,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This might help find problem cases, such as those of people with
ulterior motives making charges under the cover of secrecy.
</P>
<P>
   Hany Kiareldeen is a 30-year-old manager of a Passaic, N.J.,
electronics store who has been in the United States since 1990, and
has spent five months in jail. A declassified summary of the
allegations against him that was given to his lawyer in April said
that unnamed informants accused him of making ``a credible threat''
on Reno's life in conversations and of meeting with Nidal Ayyad,
one of the convicted World Trade Center bombers, a week before the
explosion at the building in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Shulman, the lawyer who is fighting INS efforts to deport
Kiareldeen to his native Gaza, said that he and his client, who
denies making any threats or even knowing Ayyad, suspect that the
secret evidence came from his former wife, who, the lawyer said,
had a history of vindictiveness even before the couple's bitter
divorce a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   During a deportation hearing this week in Immigration Court in
Newark, INS lawyers expressed concern that opening the hearing to
the public and allowing Shulman to ask certain questions of some
witnesses could reveal the identity of and jeopardize the safety of
a secret informer who they said had received death threats.
</P>
<P>
   Kiareldeen's former wife, Amal Mohamed, was called to the stand
to testify. She balked at answering questions about contacts she
had had with the FBI in the case, saying that it was her life that
had been threatened by some unknown forces. The case was adjourned
until Sept. 18 and Kiareldeen was returned to a prison cell while
his lawyers sought an order from a federal judge to compel Ms.
Mohamed to testify.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like we don't know who we are fighting,'' said Ms.
Maksoud, referring to Kiareldeen's and others' cases. ``It's
mind-boggling.''

BILL CLINTON, ALL ALONE 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also CLINTON-DEFENSE, CLINTON-REACT, and CLINTON-NH-VOICES) 
(js) 
 By JAMES BENNET   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ ``The president would like to speak to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of old friends, academics, legislators, political
analysts and governors have picked up the telephone in the last
five years and heard some version of those spine-straightening
words, as Bill Clinton ricocheted from one crisis to another, from
one freighted political choice to the next.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to sleep and insatiable for information, he was punching
through his cocoon of White House aides for a reality check or a
street-level glimpse of the public, to insure that he assessed
every possibility.
</P>
<P>
   But the president is not leaning on White House operators _ or
operatives _ in preparing for the most portentous day of his
turbulent career, his aides say. Faced with questioning under oath
on Monday about his private life, with impeachment proceedings
tuning up in the wings, Clinton has almost no one he can turn to
for advice, say his friends and current and former advisers.
</P>
<P>
   No one besides a few lawyers has enough information about the
president's legal predicament to give him political counsel worth a
phone call. If others learned the facts, they could be compelled to
share them with the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   The question, in the view of the president's allies, is whether
the enforced silence matters _ whether Clinton, his ultimate and
most trusted strategist, can make the right decisions in this
cliffhanger without examining every line of approach first. ``In so
many ways, this guy is being asked to act contrary to his own
instincts,'' one former White House official said.
</P>
<P>
   A profoundly private man, Clinton may acknowledge to 23 grand
jurors that he had an intimate relationship with Monica Lewinsky,
some of his closest advisers say. A cautious politician whose
reflex is to battle rather than give an inch, he is also weighing
an extraordinary gamble, describing his testimony in an address to
the nation.
</P>
<P>
   At a White House renowned for fierce response to any accusation,
damage control has, eerily, taken a holiday. The president's
advisers, uncertain of the truth, have not fanned out on television
to defend him. Some, unneeded now and anxious to project a
relaxation-as-usual image, have simply left town on long-planned
trips.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore has vanished to Hawaii for two weeks.
Erskine Bowles, the White House chief of staff, is golfing in
Scotland; his deputy, John Podesta, who has run the political
damage control effort for seven months, only returned from vacation
on Friday. Lanny Breuer, a senior member of the White House
counsel's office, has gone fishing. Bruce Lindsey, the president's
closest aide, is recuperating from back surgery, and is rarely at
the office.
</P>
<P>
   But the president's wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, canceled her
vacation in early August to stay at his side, and Chelsea Clinton,
on break from Stanford University, has stayed at the White House as
well. ``His bulwark of support, his wall of protection on this, has
been Hillary and Chelsea,'' said the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who has
met periodically with Clinton since the first thunderclap of
Lewinsky accusations in January.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said he is careful about how detailed their
conversations become, for fear of Kenneth Starr, the independent
prosecutor. ``We talk, and when we talk we have prayer, but I have
carefully stayed away from the legal area in this, because Starr's
been so bizarre in his hauling people before his grand jury,''
Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has seemed at times weary and muted recently. But if the
president feels isolated or pressured, he is not revealing it to
some close friends or to his senior aides. Riding in his limousine
in Los Angeles on Tuesday, Clinton indulged in a favorite pastime,
a game of hearts played during a running, bantering conversation.
After the president won a hand, one adviser, who had been been
asked by reporters whether Clinton was lonely, observed
sarcastically that his victory might improve his mood.
</P>
<P>
   The president glanced at him over his newly dealt hand. ``What
are you talking about?'' he asked, according to two of the players.
Another participant in the game replied, ``The press thinks you're
curled up by yourself depressed in the back of this limo.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Where do they get that?'' Clinton asked, with a baffled grin.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   To some of his own advisers, the president is a mystery now.
They wonder why he does not vent more anger. They wonder if he
misled the public and them as well. They wonder how he could have
risked his presidency on a relationship, whatever its nature, with
an intern. They mourn a lost year, and they wonder if he will get
his term back on track.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, they wonder what he will do on Monday. ``Any staff
member who tells you they know what he's doing,'' one official
said, ``they're lying.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has acknowledged having caused pain in his marriage, and
he has acknowledged a preference for boxer shorts over briefs. Such
admissions helped give him a reputation as a compulsive sharer of
personal details, a needy baby boomer turning the nation into his
analyst. In fact, despite his legion of friends, Clinton confides
in almost no one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't think that his personal, private, innermost
part, I don't believe he shares that with anybody, except maybe
Hillary,'' said David Leopoulos, one of Clinton's closest friends
since childhood. ``I don't even try to approach that with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Leopoulos said that he was amazed to read during the 1992
presidential campaign that Clinton's stepfather had been a heavy
drinker who sometimes turned violent. His friend never told him.
``Never a hint,'' he said, chalking the secrecy up to titanic inner
strength.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, on a visit to Little Rock, Clinton gathered with
friends dating back four decades. They played cards _ hearts, of
course _ and told stories until five in the morning; the president
described his trip to China and his hopes for democracy there. But
though his friends worried that he was going through a brutal time,
they did not discuss the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel terrible for him, but I don't think he feels terrible
for himself,'' Leopoulos said. ``He said the other night in our
card game, `I wish I could run again.'''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's history of relying on himself to handle agonizing
matters might explain his seeming equanimity now. He has never
counted heavily on any Democratic wise man to guide him. He ran
challenging his party's orthodoxy, implicitly repudiating the
judgment of predecessors and congressional Democrats. While he has
what one former aide calls ``crushes'' on advisers, he usually
discards them eventually and moves on to new ones, in a constant
search.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton often leaves the impression that he agrees with whatever
argument he hears. In fact, his current and former aides say, he is
usually adopting it only to test it out. Once he feels he can argue
every side of a question, he decides, alone.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's investigation has created an odd zone of mincing
conversation around the president. He is surrounded by people who
have testified before the grand jury: the steward who brings his
fruit and diet ginger ale, the personal secretary who guards his
door. For some, the rush of reporters outside the federal
courthouse and the grilling by prosecutors was a searing
experience. Yet they do not discuss it with the man at the center
of it, White House staff members say.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, however, life proceeds as though Clinton had no
testimony planned, as though his private lawyer had not moved into
the White House. On Friday, Mrs. Clinton sprang an early birthday
party for her husband, who turns 52 on Wednesday. White House staff
gathered behind the Oval Office to sing and to share a cake
decorated with sugary portraits of a golf ball, an eagle, Buddy the
dog, and Socks the cat.
</P>
<P>
   As always, Clinton has been reassured by such warm receptions,
especially the embrace of crowds. As he works ropelines or moves
among guests at fund-raisers, strangers tell them they love him or
say nasty things about Starr. In his free-form remarks before
friendly crowds at fund-raisers, the president comes as close as he
ever does to giving a public glimpse of his private thinking, aides
say. He seems preoccupied now with energizing his second term.
</P>
<P>
   The president's aides were proud for a brief time to have
persuaded him to shorten his remarks in public to just ten minutes.
But in the last couple of weeks, Clinton has pushed his typical
time to more than twice that, as he urgently counsels against
apathy. He tells crowds to grab this historical period to improve
education, strengthen Social Security, and protect the environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, this is a golden moment for our country,'' the president
said at a fund-raiser here Friday, ``and the big question is what
to do with it.''

 &HT;    Irvan No. 1 as Pontiacs occupy Pepsi front row
 &HT;    By Tom McCollister
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLYN, Mich. _ Whatever it is that brings out the best in
Pontiacs qualifying at Michigan Speedway was at work again Friday.
Ernie Irvan won the pole and Bobby Labonte the outside pole.
</P>
<P>
   It was the third race that a Pontiac graced the inside row _
Johnny Benson in 1996, Ward Burton in '97 and now Irvan.
</P>
<P>
   It was Irvan's 21st career pole, second of the year, and came on
a speed of 183.416 miles per hour. Labonte was just a tick slower,
running 183.374 mph.
</P>
<P>
   So what is the Pontiac secret?
</P>
<P>
   ``Tape,'' said Irvan. ``That car likes to be taped up solid.
When Ryan (Pemberton, crew chief) told me that, I thought he crazy.
But what it does is create downforce on the front tires.''
</P>
<P>
   It also must be attracted to high speed tracks, considering that
Pontiac drivers John Andretti and Todd Bodine held down the front
row in the spring Primestar 500 at Atlanta Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know whether what you run is good enough, especially
as fast as people are running here,'' Irvan said. ``We aren't
really trying for poles, but they are nice to have.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Pontiacs dominate the first row, Jeff Gordon's Chevrolet
was just a tick slower in 183.341 mph, and Dale Jarrett was fourth
in his Ford Taurus with a speed of 183.132.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew we weren't pole material today, but I was hoping to go
a little faster than that,'' Gordon said of his lap. ``Going out
first you never know how this track is going to pick up. I knew
coming off turn four to take the green flag (starting the lap),
that the car felt really, really tight. Still, it was faster than
we ran in practice.''
</P>
<P>
   No one can complain. This was an equal opportunity qualifier,
featuring three Pontiacs, four Chevys and three Fords in the top
10.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Earnhardt wasn't in one of them. He never got off pit road,
victimized by a faulty oil pump.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hadn't been running that great, but we tried some things
for qualifying and were going to give it our best shot,'' said
Earnhardt, who may try again today or take a provisional. ``As I
started off pit road, the oil light came on. It had locked the oil
pump and broke the belt. It's a freak deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt isn't the only one looking for help. Johnny Benson is
39th, Darrell Waltrip 40th, Dave Marcis 45th and Kevin LePage,
making his debut with Roush Racing, is 46th.

JONES DELIVERS BIG THANK YOU
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, who announced
Thursday that the Cowboys would return to Wichita Falls for
training camp next year, didn't plan on announcing the Cowboys'
intentions for 1999 this early.
</P>
<P>
   However, he said he thought the city and Midwestern State
University had earned such an announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was something they deserved,'' Jones said. ``This is an
expression of how pleased we are and how effective our training
camp has been here. The facilities are tremendous, and there's an
energy here.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones said his decision was influenced by the players, who raved
about their dormitory, the meeting rooms and a respect for privacy.
He didn't even consider another site.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman said the players are pleased
with the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pretty excited to be coming back,'' Aikman said. ``The
people have been great. The facilities have been wonderful. From a
player's perspective, we couldn't ask for anything more.''
</P>
<P>
   Wichita Falls and Midwestern State couldn't ask for anything
more either, as both are expecting big returns from the presence of
the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   The city projects that training camp will have an economic
impact of more than $4.2 million. It cost $450,000 of city and
private funds to put on the training camp.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the money, however, Midwestern State President Louis
Rodriguez said the heightened national awareness of the school and
city can't be measured financially.
</P>
<P>
   Close to 90,000 fans, including many out-of-towners, have
attended practices in this city of 103,000. The Cowboys issued 550
media credentials during the past four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, noting that the camp was pulled off in only five
months of preparation time, said a year to prepare will make things
bigger and better. &QL; 
LETT COULD BE BACK EARLY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Though defensive tackle Leon Lett will miss the rest of the
preseason with a sprained medial collateral ligament in his left
knee, he could return to practice in less than three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys trainer Jim Maurer said Lett will probably begin light
running in 10 days. And while Lett won't play in any remaining
preseason games, Maurer said he will certainly see time on the
practice field before the Cowboys open against the Arizona
Cardinals on Sept. 6.
</P>
<P>
   Lett injured his knee when Saints quarterback Billy Joe Hobert
fell on him during Tuesday's scrimmage in Shreveport, La. &QL; 
BRIEFLY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys guard Nate Newton didn't practice yesterday because of
knee swelling. The trainers, however, expect him to practice today
and play in Monday's game against the New England Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive end Kavika Pittman, still hobbled by a sprained ankle,
is not expected to play against the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   Running back Chris Warren (groin) has a ``50-50'' chance of
playing against the Patriots, Maurer said.

COMMENTARY: RAZZLE DAZZLE 'EM 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By FRANK RICH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The most short-lived comeback in the history of show
business ended this week when Michael Ovitz was brought to grief on
Broadway in a plot worthy of ``The Producers.'' The tale would
match Mel Brooks' in hilarity if only thousands of innocent
stockholders _ not unlike the little old ladies romanced by Zero
Mostel into investing in ``Springtime for Hitler'' _ weren't left
holding the bag.
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz, you may recall, is the former superagent whom the press
anointed ``the most powerful man in Hollywood'' _ but who fell from
grace in 1996 when Michael Eisner canned him as president of Disney
after only 14 months.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this April, Ovitz was resurrected once more as a major
show-biz player by the media, after he spent $20 million of his
$100-million-plus Disney settlement to take control of Livent, the
Toronto-based theater-producing company that gave Broadway
``Ragtime.''
</P>
<P>
   But a not-so-funny thing happened on the way to the Tony Awards
that ``Ragtime'' failed to win. Ovitz is now crying that he was
duped by another show-biz hype artist: Garth Drabinsky, the
co-founder of Livent and the producer of its shows.
</P>
<P>
   The Ovitz management at Livent alleges that Drabinsky engaged in
accounting ``irregularities'' to hide the severity of its losses.
Drabinsky, who denies the charges, has been locked out of his
office _ and trading in Livent stock has been halted as official
investigators move in.
</P>
<P>
   Whether any books were cooked or not, it's still amazing how
easily Ovitz and a credulous press were played for suckers,
especially given Drabinsky's history of having been pushed out of
the movie-theater chain Cineplex Odeon in 1989 for piling up debt.
</P>
<P>
   Any outsider with common sense and a pencil could figure out
that Livent was hemorrhaging money by simply adding up rough
figures on the back of an envelope. There is no way that
extravaganzas like ``Ragtime'' and ``Show Boat'' could have been
making profits, no matter how many seats they were selling (and
Variety reported plenty of empty seats on the road).
</P>
<P>
   The shows' overhead _ huge casts, grandiose sets and costumes,
unprecedented ad blitzes _ was simply too high. Weeks before Ovitz
bought into Livent, the off-Broadway revue ``Forbidden Broadway''
was featuring a ``Gagtime'' parody in which a little boy warned
investors, ``You won't make your money back!''
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz, who apparently believed his own inflated press, fell for
Drabinsky's, too. Though some journalists have been skeptical of
Livent from the start, more typical was a naive 1997 New Yorker
piece in which speculative, impressive-sounding box-office figures
($600 million for ``Show Boat'' by 2000) were tossed around as if
they insured profitability, and Drabinsky was portrayed as having
the potential to turn the gamble of Broadway producing into ``more
of a risk-free proposition.''
</P>
<P>
   On the same day this year that Livent posted a $30 million loss,
an extensive Washington Post profile was on the stands saluting
Drabinsky's ``Midas touch.'' The media, not unlike the rest of
America, seem to go gaga when caught in the klieg lights of a
self-promoting P.T. Barnum who throws glitzy opening-night parties
and travels by private jet.
</P>
<P>
   When Drabinsky took his tumble this week, theater people
lamented the ``tragedy'' of it all _ the tragedy apparently being
that he won't be showering famously inflated salaries on Broadway
anymore. No one could seriously argue that his actual contributions
to the stage remotely matched those of his models Florenz Ziegfeld,
David Merrick and Cameron Mackintosh.
</P>
<P>
   If there's a real tragedy here, it's for the stockholders in
Livent. A source close to the situation says that the company is
now pinning its immediate hopes on ``Fosse,'' its new musical
stitched out of old Bob Fosse dance numbers, and on the Chicago
opening of ``Ragtime.'' But the last Broadway dance anthology like
``Fosse'' _ ``Jerome Robbins' Broadway'' _ lost millions, and
there's no reason to believe ``Ragtime'' will be any more
profitable in Chicago than it has been in its slack road
engagements thus far in Los Angeles, Washington and Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday some mutual-fund companies holding Livent shares wrote
down the value of their investments by as much as 70 percent.
Ovitz, who's on a cruise in Europe, could not be reached for
comment. He's presumably contemplating his next comeback, as no
doubt is Drabinsky. Hold the front page.

DISNEY-FOX FRAY OVER RIGHTS TO NHL MAKES DOLLARS, SENSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By DAVID A. MARKIEWICZ 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Never throw anything away, my Aunt Jane the collector used to
say, someday it might be valuable.
</P>
<P>
   So here I sit with my six Phil Ortega baseball cards, a case of
Billy Beer and my Mod Squad lunch box. Worth about a buck-fifty
altogether, I figure, though you could fairly say any picture of
Peggy Lipton in her prime is just about priceless.
</P>
<P>
   That must be the way Big TV is looking at the NHL these days.
Not that long ago, say around the time hockey came to Dallas, TV
broadcast rights for a season-load of Whalers vs. Jets could be had
for the cost of a retired Beanie Baby.
</P>
<P>
   Not anymore. The Walt Disney Co., which ought to know something
about the value of programming, is offering to pay the NHL $600
million over five years to carry games on its ESPN, ESPN2 and ABC
networks.
</P>
<P>
   And Fox, which has been showing NHL games on weekends the past
several years with little ratings success, is considering matching
the ABC portion of that bid and keeping the glow in its comet-tail
puck.
</P>
<P>
   Now, $600 million isn't much compared to the NFL's $18 billion,
eight-year contract with the networks, but then a lot more people
are willing to watch Brett Favre throw than Pavel Bure skate.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the NHL played about as well in American living rooms
last year as the Blackhawks did in Chicago. Over the past four
years, viewership is down by a third, with young male watchers
abandoning in even larger numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Heck, more people drank Billy Beer during the Carter
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, here are two media giants, Disney and Fox, battling for the
rights to bring you hockey in the next millennium. There is even
talk of a legal set-to, with the Fox folks saying NHL executives
didn't properly explain to them the details of the Disney bid in
time to meet yesterday's league-imposed deadline for a
counteroffer.
</P>
<P>
   It's like fighting over the rights to sign Ortega out of
retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, considering the state of pitching these days ...
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the Disney-Fox squabble might make business sense.
Maybe not enough to justify a 260 percent increase in rights fees,
but sense all the same.
</P>
<P>
   Securing the rights to air NHL games on ESPN, ESPN2 and ABC
starting in 1999-2000 won't win Disney the TV equivalent of the
Stanley Cup. But, for a relatively paltry sum, Disney's networks,
especially the Deuce, would get even more of that oh-so desirable,
hard-to-come-by TV commodity _ live, quality sports programming.
</P>
<P>
   Live sports programming is about as valuable to a network
executive as goal-scorers are to a hockey club.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN already has NHL cable rights, in a shared package with Fox,
but under the new Disney-take-all proposal its cable networks would
get even more games. ESPN2 would go from 75 per season to more than
100, while ESPN would keep about two dozen contests on its
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   NHL ratings might be down, but, as anybody who's a regular
watcher of the Deuce knows, even a midseason Canucks-Kings game is
preferable to reruns of ``World's Strongest Cheerleaders'', or
``In-line Skating Bloopers''.
</P>
<P>
   Disney executives are also betting that the long-anticipated
hockey boom occurs sometime during the new contract. No one could
expect boffo viewership back in the days of the Original Six, or
even after the first or second rounds of expansion. There still
were too many teams in Canada then and not enough in the United
States, particularly in the South and the West.
</P>
<P>
   Now, that has all changed. With teams up and running or in
production in Nashville, Tenn.; Minneapolis; Atlanta; and Columbus,
Ohio, hockey truly is a national game. That should mean more
viewers, particularly young ones. If it all plays out, hockey may
someday be a ratings success story, a programming piece well worth
collecting.
</P>
<P>
   My Aunt Jane would be pleased.
</P>

MORGAN STANLEY TO EXPAND IN TIMES SQUARE AREA 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CHARLES V. BAGLI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Morgan Stanley Dean Witter has signed an agreement to
move into a new 1-million-square-foot office tower on Seventh
Avenue between 49th and 50th Streets, according to real estate
executives.
</P>
<P>
   If completed, the deal would represent the latest in a series of
expansion moves by the city's big investment houses, whose growth
has helped fuel New York City's economic resurgence in the last few
years. It also would add another piece to a building boom in the
Times Square area driven largely by media and financial companies.
</P>
<P>
   After many months of on-again, off-again negotiations, Morgan
Stanley signed a letter of intent Tuesday with Rockefeller Group
Development Corp. to build and occupy a proposed 33-story glass
tower on what is now a parking lot and a rare development site in
midtown Manhattan, according to the executives, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The site, known as Rockefeller Plaza West, was a victim of the
recession in the early 1990s and sat fallow for nine years. But
with rents soaring and little vacant space available in midtown,
the land has become very valuable, although at least two companies
in the last year have tried and failed to come to terms with the
owner, the Rockefeller Group, which is a subsidiary of Mitsubishi
Estate Co.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockefeller Group's plans for the Seventh Avenue tower are
now going through the city's land use review process. According to
documents filed with the Planning Commission, the 33-story
skyscraper would include an atrium at the corner of Seventh Avenue
and 49th Street with an entrance to the subway as well as the vast
underground concourse beneath Rockefeller Center to the east.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley's letter of intent gives the investment bank
exclusive rights to complete a deal at Rock West within a specified
time, one real estate executive said.
</P>
<P>
   If a final deal is struck this time, the new office tower would
be Morgan Stanley's third building in the area and its latest step
in creating a corporate campus at the northern end of Times Square.
The Rock West site is across the street from Morgan Stanley's
building at 750 Seventh Ave. And both buildings are only a block
north of the investment bank's 43-story headquarters at 1585
Broadway, between 47th and 48th Streets.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley, like many of the largest investment banks, moved
to midtown during the 1970s from lower Manhattan, the city's
traditional financial center. In 1995, the investment bank decamped
to a newly resurgent Times Square, suddenly rife with financial and
media and entertainment companies like Disney, Viacom, Bertelsmann
AG, Proskauer Rose and, soon, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &AMP; Flom.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley and other major financial institutions are
expanding. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the
number of jobs in the securities industry in New York City hit a
record of 164,300 in June, surpassing the previous peak of 163,000
for the first time in 11 years. Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. and Merrill
Lynch &AMP; Co. are both scouring the metropolitan area for more office
space, while Bear Stearns &AMP; Co. is building a new headquarters on
Madison Avenue between 46th and 47th Streets.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley declined comment Friday, as did the company's
broker, Colliers ABR. Rockefeller Group Development president
Jonathan Green was no more forthcoming, nor was his broker, Cushman
&AMP; Wakefield. But word of the tentative deal, which was shrouded by
confidentiality agreements, spread quickly through the real estate
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``This continues the trend of large financial companies
devouring whatever space is available in the city today,'' said
Howard Michaels, chairman of the Carlton Group, a real estate
advisory firm. ``As the Wall Street boom continues, the space
requirements for the investment banks grow ever larger.''
</P>
<P>
   In this year's first four months, financial service companies
accounted for nearly 11 percent of all commercial leasing in the
city, according to a recent report from the office of state
Comptroller H. Carl McCall.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman, Sachs is putting together its own corporate campus
downtown, where the investment bank recently leased 660,000 square
feet of space at 180 Maiden Lane and 520,000 square feet at 10
Hanover Square. The company, which is based nearby at 85 Broad St.
and One New York Plaza, is back in the market looking for more
space, according to real estate brokers.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch, which bought a 780,000-square-foot tower at 222
Broadway last year, is now hunting for a million more square feet
and will probably end up finding space in nearby Jersey City, N.J.,
brokers said.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from real estate, Wall Street has fueled budget surpluses
for the city and the state and accounted for an astounding 56
percent of the increase in inflation-adjusted earnings in New York
City between 1992 and 1997, while representing only 5 percent of
the jobs. But financial analysts have warned of the danger that the
city's economy is so dependent on the fortunes of Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``While good times on Wall Street pour unprecedented personal
and business tax revenue into the city and the state, the flow of
income from this single area poses some risks,'' McCall said
Thursday. ``A market downturn, or worse, a broader economic
recession, would result in job losses and the loss of a significant
source of funds for the city and the state.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite a robust stock market and record profits among Wall
Street companies, the American and New York Stock Exchanges, the
commodity exchanges and the investment banks have demanded hundreds
of millions of dollars in tax breaks to remain in the city. Morgan
Stanley, which received a $100 million tax subsidy in the early
1990s, is expected to go back to the city for more if a deal is
struck at Rock West.
</P>
<P>
   The tower would be something of a victory for Mitsubishi Estate,
which lost a billion-dollar investment in the historic Rockefeller
Center complex during the recession.
</P>
<P>
   The site itself has served as a barometer of the New York real
estate market. Green began buying the parcels that make up the site
at the start of the last real estate boom in 1980. But by the time
he had demolished the existing buildings and obtained city approval
in 1990 for a 55-story, 1.3 million square foot limestone tower, a
recession had devastated the New York real estate market. In 1994,
the Rockefeller Group turned it into a parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the Rockefeller Group nearly struck a deal with
Morgan Stanley for the property, but it ultimately balked at the
suggestion of turning over the property to Morgan Stanley's
developer, Gerald Hines.
</P>
<P>
   According to one executive who knows of the deal, Morgan Stanley
returned to the negotiating table recently, agreeing to lease the
land for 99 years, pay the Rockefeller Group a development fee and
still use Hines to build the project.

U.S. URGED ARMS MONITOR TO AVOID CLASH WITH IRAQ 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Ariz.)  (lb) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States and Britain urged Richard Butler,
the chairman of the U.N. arms-inspection team, not to have a
confrontation with Iraq by trying to hold a surprise inspection
after Baghdad suspended cooperation with the inspectors earlier
this month, senior U.S. and British officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The officials were responding to a Washington Post report on
Friday about private U.S. discussions with Butler and his decision
to drop plans for the inspections.
</P>
<P>
   Until Baghdad broke off cooperation with U.N. inspectors on Aug.
3, these officials said, they had supported Butler's plans to hold
surprise inspections at two sites that promised new information
about Iraq's chemical, biological and missile programs. Butler had
brought the necessary inspectors to Iraq when he arrived on Aug. 2,
intending to go ahead with the inspections.
</P>
<P>
   But on Aug. 3, once Iraq broke its February agreement with the
Security Council and the U.N. secretary-general, Kofi Annan, to
cooperate fully with the inspectors, the officials said, they did
urge caution on Butler. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright sent
word to Butler that she wished to speak to him. After leaving
Baghdad, Butler traveled to Bahrain, where he could talk to her on
a secure line in the U.S. Embassy.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said that they were not eager to rush into a
``precipitate confrontation'' with Iraq that would focus on Butler
instead of Iraq's breach of its promise to the Security Council and
Annan. Nor did they want another military crisis with Iraq on
Baghdad's timetable, before Washington could prepare the political
and diplomatic ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``A confrontation on the ground in Iraq may prove a point, but
it doesn't get you closer to what you want to accomplish, which is
to help UNSCOM do what it needs to do,'' a senior Clinton
administration official said, referring to the U.N. Special
Commission on arms inspections. ``By keeping the focus on what Iraq
has done, which is to suspend inspections, rather than on what
Butler does, allows no country on the Security Council to contend,
as some have done over the last six months, that UNSCOM and Butler
have provoked Iraq.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Friday, Albright denied reports that she
had been urging Butler, the chairman of the U.N. Special
Commission, for months to avoid confrontations with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had no change in our policy,'' said Albright. ``We
support UNSCOM in its inspections and fully support UNSCOM's right
to decide where, when and how it conducts its inspections.'' She
added: ``I do not tell Chairman Butler what to do. There should be
absolutely no doubt that the United States wants to see UNSCOM
succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   She was responding to news reports, also broadcast on NBC
Nightly News on Thursday night, that Washington and London had
tried, over a period of months, to dissuade Butler from carrying
out surprise inspections in Iraq in order to avoid a new crisis
with Baghdad. The reports cited officials concerned that Washington
and London were undermining UNSCOM and arms control, a concern
expressed regularly by some UNSCOM officials who request anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The White House spokesman, Mike McCurry, emphasized that
although Butler takes advice from the Security Council, he makes
all operational decisions on whether to make an inspection.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is not our role,'' McCurry said. Asked whether U.S.
officials had suggested that certain inspections be delayed or
stopped, McCurry said: ``We consulted with them about the best way
to conduct their mission _ timing, outcomes, best way of achieving
their mission. But we don't order them not to conduct missions.''
</P>
<P>
   UNSCOM itself issued a press release saying that ``the
allegations are false.'' The statement denied that Butler ``has
been given or accepted external direction with respect to
operational activities'' of the commission and said he would ``find
it invidious were any attempt made to direct his operational
decisions or to micromanage the day-to-day work of the Special
Commission.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   According to the Post account, sometime in mid-July Butler met
with Peter Burleigh, the second-ranking U.S. delegate to the United
Nations. Burleigh read Butler a list of U.S. questions about the
planned raids. While Burleigh stressed that the decision was
Butler's, he left Butler, the Post said, ``with the plain
understanding that the United States did not support his plan.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior U.S. official, after having read the guidance Burleigh
read to Butler, disputed the account, saying that the questions had
sought information about what Butler planned, and that Burleigh had
begun and ended the meeting with a statement of support for Butler
and his work.
</P>
<P>
   Butler intended to go ahead with the inspections, taking the
appropriate experts with him to Baghdad, said British, U.S. and
U.N. officials on Friday. It was only after Baghdad ``pulled the
plug'' on Butler on Aug. 3 that Washington and London suggested
that he avoid new inspections that Baghdad was going to block
anyway, and that he take up Iraq's breaking of its promises with
the Security Council first.
</P>
<P>
   Butler then made the tactical decision to pull out the
inspectors and informed Washington of that decision, the officials
insisted. One senior official said that Washington had expected
Iraq to pull the plug on Butler closer to October, when economic
sanctions are up for review. One reason, the official suggested,
might have been leaks to Baghdad about Butler's inspection plans.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Rep. Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., the chairman of the
House International Relations Committee, wrote Albright to ask for
a copy of Burleigh's talking points, ``as well as similar talking
points used by other administration officials,'' including herself,
in discussions with Butler.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., wrote Clinton urging him to clarify
Iraq policy and reaffirm his commitment to eradicating Iraq's
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   The officials insisted that UNSCOM had been making significant
progress in the last few months and had held as many as 10 surprise
inspections, which included one at Air Force headquarters that
produced a document leading to the discovery of Iraq's production
of VX nerve gas for missiles, which Iraq had denied.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been the most consistent and forceful proponent of
UNSCOM's right to conduct challenge inspections and to have full
access when and where it chooses,'' a senior U.S. official said.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said that the burden is now on Annan and the
Security Council to get Iraq to keep its word and allow UNSCOM to
work freely.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fault here clearly lies with Baghdad and not with
Butler,'' one official said. ``There's only one place to point the
finger. It strengthens our hand in the Security Council, it shows
the region that Washington is flexible and not eager to strike
militarily at Iraq, and it lays the foundation for military action
if necessary, while giving Saddam a chance to fold first in the
face of a truly united Security Council.''

 &HT;    Bush ad meant to be humorous, but MacKay isn't laughing
 &HT;    By Brian E. Crowley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Radio listeners began listening Friday
to what Jeb Bush is calling humorous while Buddy MacKay says it is
the beginning of the nasty campaign for governor.
</P>
<P>
   The 60-second ad accuses Lt. Gov. MacKay of being a lifelong
proponent of higher taxes. As an announcer lists a series of taxes
that MacKay has supported during his political career, other voices
express shock and dismay.
</P>
<P>
   One, an older women with a strong Southern accent says, ``I'm
getting steeeamed, Buddy.'' Others say ``Buddy'' in derisive tones.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign insists that the ad is factual and that the
humorous approach is intended to poke fun at MacKay's record, not
MacKay as a person. The MacKay campaign accepts neither
explanation. They accuse Bush of launching a negative attack on
MacKay and distorting his record.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have been saying for months that everyone should run and
hide because we were going to be attacking them,'' said Robin
Rorapaugh, MacKay's campaign manager. ``Look who's attacking. This
is the death knell of the kinder, gentler Jeb Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's spokesman, Cory Tilley, said MacKay, ``has asked voters
to judge him on his experience. That's what we're doing, in a
humorous way. We're looking at his experience, which has been to
try and raise every tax he's ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   MacKay has promised that if elected governor, he will not raise
taxes during his first term. Rorapaugh says that MacKay has
supported tax increases during his political career but she adds
that an elected official cannot spend more 30 years in office
without at times seeing a need to raise taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are times when it is the responsible thing to do,''
Rorapaugh said. ``This is just further evidence that Jeb Bush has a
total lack of understanding about what it means to be in public
life. He might check with members of his family who have been in
public life and broken promises to raise taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   She is referring to a pledge President Bush made during the 1988
campaign when he said, ``read my lips, no new taxes.'' Shortly into
his first term, Bush reneged on that promise. Jeb Bush, saying he
has learned from his father's mistake, says he wants to lower taxes
but has not made a promise not to raise taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Jeb Bush is doing is distorting the facts and making
statements that are untrue and unfair,'' Rorapaugh said. ``This is
the kind of campaign voters have come to expect from Bush.''

 &HT;    Haitian woman who drowned could have been in U.S. legally
 &HT;    By Bill Douthat
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Benette Dorsonne was running out of
hope, her family says. After waiting eight years for a visa to
leave Haiti and join her family in Delray Beach, the 26-year-old
woman sought a faster route.
</P>
<P>
   She traveled nearly 800 miles, but the last few yards cost her
her life.
</P>
<P>
   Dorsonne was one of two Haitians who drowned near Florida's
Jupiter Inlet Monday after a smuggler dumped a boatload of
immigrants on a sandbar and left them to swim the last 100 yards to
shore.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. State Department official calls the death ``almost a
Greek tragedy.'' He said Dorsonne could have been on her way to
American by now if she had answered a letter sent to her home in
Port-au-Prince last November.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never got a response,'' the official said Friday from the
U.S. Embassy in the Haitian capital. ``The missing piece is: where
was she in November?'' said the embassy staffer, who asked not to
be identified.
</P>
<P>
   ``I doubt the letter was ever sent,'' said Bruna Dorsonne, 24,
Benette's younger sister, who lives in Delray Beach. ``There is no
way she would miss something that important.''
</P>
<P>
   Dorsonne's family said they saw Benette in Port-au-Prince last
month, at the same home where she had lived for several years and
at the same address where Benette's mother got her only visa
approval letter in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The embassy official said Benette's file notes no contacts from
the family. Her father, Joseph Dorsonne, 56, said he and other
family members tried to contact the embassy on visits in past
years, but no one was ever available to talk to them.
</P>
<P>
   Dorsonne said he applied for Benette to come to the United
States on a family immigration visa in 1990. He also applied for
his wife, Jeann-Loretta, who emigrated on a visa in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Dorsonne said the last he heard of Benette's application was in
October 1991 when he got a letter saying his petition was approved
_ but Benette would have to wait until her name came up in the
annual allotment of visas.
</P>
<P>
   Dorsonne's application did not qualify for first preference, a
category reserved for children of U.S. citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are a resident alien, you are at the lowest
priority,'' said Alfred Celcis, a Delray Beach paralegal who helped
Dorsonne fill out the visa petition for his daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Time also worked against the Dorsonnes. Benette's 21st birthday,
in January 1993, dropped her another notch in the preference
ratings.
</P>
<P>
   ``They put her at the end of the line,'' said Dorsonne.
</P>
<P>
   He was more fortunate with getting a visa for his wife. Wives
and children under 21 fall into a larger allotment category.
</P>
<P>
   The number of immigrant visas allocated for adult children of
green card residents is 26,266 for 1998. Benette was competing with
applicants from all over the globe.
</P>
<P>
   A typical wait for applicants in that category is six years.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Benette had passed her eighth anniversary as an visa
applicant.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was so frustrated because she had been waiting so long,''
said her brother, Vernel, 30, who immigrated to the United States
in 1983, three years after his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time we went down there to see her, we could see that
frustration in her face,'' Vernel said. ``We didn't know if it
would be another 10, 20 or 30 years before she could come.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Haitians who sneak ashore during the dark of night
are part of the visa-weary, said Daniella Henry, coordinator of the
Haitian American Community Council in Delray Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have been waiting eight or nine years and they don't want
to wait anymore,'' said Henry, who said Haiti's worsening economic
condition is driving this summer's increase in smuggling.
</P>
<P>
   A Miami immigration attorney, Cheryl Little, said complaints
against the U.S. Embassy's consular services in Haiti are common.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't get anyone on the phone, you don't get your letters
answered and cases seem to get lost in the system,'' said Little,
who works with the Florida Immigration Advocacy Center.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Little wrote a report on the problem that she titled:
Haitian Children Awaiting Visas _ A Plea for Help.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be time for another report,'' Little said.
</P>
<P>
   The Dorsonnes will bury their daughter in Delray Beach today,
following 10 a.m. services at the Our Lady of Perpetual Help
Haitian Catholic Church, 510 SW 8th Ave. in Delray Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Vernel Dorsonne said the family is now worrying about his
younger brother, Evens, 22, who applied for a visa to leave Haiti
along with Benette. They wonder if he will keep faith in the visa
allotment or follow Benette's path.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know what's in his mind,'' said Vernel.

 &HT;    Confessed killer jumps to his death from moving prison van
 &HT;    By Lillian Weis and Daniel Moffett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ He had been calling all the shots for
the past two months as he confessed to killing five people in New
York and burying one of them outside Greenacres since 1985. But
when it came time to pay his penance, not even handcuffs, shackles
and a moving van could keep him from taking his own life as he
plunged about 65 feet to his death.
</P>
<P>
   ``My lessons here are learned- onto a better place now... I
Win,'' Gary Charles Evans, 43, of Troy, N.Y. wrote in a letter
delivered to his attorney Randolph F. Treece Friday afternon.
</P>
<P>
   Evans, a convicted antiques thief who has been arrested at least
23 times and has eight felony convictions, would have become the
third Death Row inmate since the state's 1995 death penalty law if
convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters pulled Evans' body from the Hudson River with a
boat where he was pronounced dead at the scene before noon Friday,
authorities said. He landed on the rocky edge of the Hudson River
in a foot of water, U.S. Marshals said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were traveling about 60 miles an hour when he apparently
threw both his feet through the window and shattered it,'' said
Troy Fire Chief Robert Essigan. ``Somehow he jumped out the window,
over the guardrail and into the water.''
</P>
<P>
   Essigan said Evans had his hands shackled behind him and his
feet chained when he was riding in the rear of a caged U.S.
Marshals van on what was supposed to be a 20-minute trip back from
a U.S. District Court in Albany. A second vehicle, also with two
deputy U.S. Marshals, followed the van driving Evans back to the
Rensselaer County Jail where he was being held without bail. Evans
had just been sentenced to two years for a federal parole violation
when the van crossed the Troy-Menands bridge about 11 a.m., and he
dove onto the roadway through the side window.
</P>
<P>
   ``To go off a bridge that high ..., the fall would have to kill
you,'' Essigan said. ``I got to him 10 minutes after he jumped and
he was already dead. He didn't drown.'''
</P>
<P>
   Both vehicles stopped and deputies chased Evans who hobbled to
the side of the road after heading towards one of the deputies
first before jumping off of the bridge.
</P>
<P>
   The first calls to firefighters were reports that a construction
worker had been hit by a car and knocked off the bridge. Passersby
saw Evans' orange coveralls and thought he was working on a road
crew. The two marshals escorting him called for help and watched
from the shore.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was really nothing they could do,'' Essigan said. ``This
guy was quite an escape artist. He was good, and I guess this was
his spectacular ending.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans told police he killed three of his childhood friends in
June and led them to their bodies including one in Palm Beach
County, Fla. Timothy Rysedorph, 39, of Saratoga Springs, had been
shot in the back of the head several times before Evans dismembered
his body with a chain saw in October, police said. Evans had been
charged with two counts of first-degree murder in Rysedorph's death
making him eligible for the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   He was also charged with the shooting deaths of Damien Cuomo,
28, of Troy, on Dec. 27, 1989, and Michael Falco, 26, also of Troy,
in 1985. Palm Beach County sheriff's officials and New York State
Police unearthed Falco's skeletal remains in a wooded area on the
grounds of the Fountains Golf &AMP; Country Club on July 14th. Evans
told police he shot Falco in the back of the head 13 years ago, put
his body in the trunk of his friend's car and then drove him to
Palm Beach County.
</P>
<P>
   ``He killed Michael when he was 26,'' said Elaine DiMauro,
Falco's former girlfriend and the mother of his two children _
Kelly, 18, and Justin, 16. ``He had a family and two children to
look forward to.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hoping he would go to jail,'' DiMauro said. ``Justice
still hasn't been served.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans had also confessed to the murders of two coin and jewelry
shop owners who he killed in Herkimer an Jefferson counties in 1989
and 1991. He had been traveling across the country before he was
arrested in St. Johnsbury, Vt. in May, police said. He was
extradited to New York after being charged with stealing antique
cufflinks worth $1,500.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the gates of hell are opening wide open for this
man,'' DiMauro, 37, of Sunrise said. ``The fires are burning pretty
crisp. I hope to God they sufficate him.''

CIVILIANS FLEE CONGO'S CAPITAL IN FEAR OF REBEL ADVANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By HOWARD W. FRENCH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   KINSHASA, Congo _ Increasingly uncertain that the government can
keep approaching rebel forces at bay, thousands of foreigners and
Congolese alike fled the capital Friday by whatever means they
could.
</P>
<P>
   The rush to leave came even as things seemed to veer in the
direction of normality, however temporarily, with the restoration
of electrical power to the city after a 24-hour interruption.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to the urgent-sounding calls of almost every major
Western country for its citizens to leave Congo, foreigners and
locals with the cash and visas needed to board flights besieged
airline offices and filled every available seat on the few
remaining commercial flights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have got to get my family out,'' said one longtime foreign
resident, who despite abundant business connections with the
airlines had to struggle against many people, some offering bribes
to airline officials, to secure three seats for relatives. ``I
myself will stay behind. But no one knows what might happen here,
and the family had to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   By day's end, virtually every scheduled airline had canceled its
service to Kinshasa, a city of more than 5 million. Western
countries, including the United States and France, were making
arrangements Friday for special charter flights to evacuate their
remaining citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Many in Kinshasa feared the worst after a night without
electricity, which followed the rebels' dramatic seizure of
Africa's largest hydroelectric dam. But power was restored in most
parts of the city by midday Friday.
</P>
<P>
   That set off another round of competing rebel and government
claims over the course of a nearly two-week-old conflict that at
times has seemed as much psychological as military.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels said they still held the dam at Inga, about 200 miles
southwest of here, but had restored the power supply as a
humanitarian gesture. They threatened to cut it off again within
three days if Kabila still clung to power.
</P>
<P>
   The government, having already suffered a huge blow with the
interruption of electricity Thursday, sought to reassure a public
already tending toward flight and despair.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dam was not taken by the invaders,'' Energy Minister
Christian Eloko Botula said in an interview on the national radio
once transmission was restored. ``There was simply a technical
failure, and it has been repaired.''
</P>
<P>
   That posture was belied by a private admission by a government
minister on Thursday that the dam had been lost to the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   For most people here, the failure of electricity has meant the
failure of the water supply as well. And for reasons that have not
been explained, the restoration of the power grid has not brought a
resumption of running water.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time since decolonization that we have been
without both water and electricity,'' said Albert Mbuy, 54, who
spoke near his house in the crowded popular neighborhood known as
La Cite.
</P>
<P>
   A bystander, Kini Mbabu, responded, ``It looks like a game to
make us afraid.''
</P>
<P>
   Electricity and water were not the only bad news for the
government either, although the impact of even more potentially
serious developments has not yet come to be widely felt.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels said Friday that they had resumed flights of men and
weapons from cities under their control in the country's far east,
where the uprising began, toward the west, where they were
reinforcing their positions and preparing to attack new targets.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the conflict, diplomats here have said they have had
few precise details about the rebels' activities. But witnesses
sighted airplanes taking off today from the eastern city of Goma
near the Rwandan border, and a foreign military expert and a local
aviation specialist here both confirmed an abundance of mysterious
flights from the east.
</P>
<P>
   Although Western diplomats among others have described the Tutsi
ethnic group of Rwanda as the primary backer of the revolt, it
remains unclear who actually makes up the rebel ranks.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels have been careful to present a diverse and visibly
Congolese face to the public, and given the dislike of Rwandans in
Congo, the leadership of any future government would be expected to
be similarly diverse, not led by Tutsi, who are but a tiny minority
in Congo.
</P>
<P>
   Little is known about the ideology of the rebels, who express
platitudes about clean government and democracy.
</P>
<P>
   What they have accomplished so far has been done with
surprisingly scant means. Angolan soldiers who visited the
strategic western city of Boma, by the border with Angola, said the
rebels were holding that town with as few as 100 men.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Similarly, the nearby provincial capital of Matadi, a major
western city, fell to the rebels on Thursday after a relatively
minor clash. By all accounts, government soldiers in the area far
outnumbered the rebels but panicked and fled their positions,
looting shops and vehicles in their path. Today, to general
disbelief, the government announced that in addition to the Inga
dam, it still controlled Matadi.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kabila made the mistake of counting on numbers rather than
quality when he put together his army,'' said one Congolese colonel
who gave the government little chance of defeating the rebels.
``They discarded the notion of elite corps and specialization,
destroying everything they found without distinction. The problem
now is that our neighbors have serious armies with experienced
units, and it is easy for them to dominate us.''
</P>
<P>
   The notion of foreign domination has always been at the heart of
this conflict, with Kabila, himself installed a year earlier in the
same kind of operation, complaining bitterly of an invasion by
Rwanda, with the help of Uganda and perhaps Western benediction as
well.
</P>
<P>
   For the colonel _ as for Kabila and many Congolese and foreign
diplomats as well _ it is a fact scarcely worth debating that from
the start Rwanda has had an important hand in the rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   Faring poorly on the battlefield, Kabila's government has made
the foreign support for his adversaries a major theme of its
propaganda war, and has had little trouble whipping up popular
passions against Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   At the outset of the rebellion, Kabila's forces in the capital
organized a roundup of Rwandans _ and Congolese of suspected
Rwandan ancestry _ that involved house-to-house searches, beatings
and in at least a few cases lynchings and summary executions.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, international rights groups have complained that the
state radio here has waged a hate campaign against Rwandans.
</P>
<P>
   But the depth of sentiment against Rwandans was profound
already, in part because of resentment over their role in aiding
Kabila's takeover.
</P>
<P>
   Now that resentment stands as one of Kabila's strongest
remaining assets in his fight against the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want the Rwandans here,'' said one elderly man who
declined to give his name, ``and a lot of people are going to die
if they don't understand that. This country is Congo, and it
belongs to the Congolese alone.''

INVESTOR SUES INSURER 20TH CENTURY OVER BUYOUT BY AIG
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 &HT;    By BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- An investor has sued 20th Century Industries,
saying it failed to protect shareholder interests as American
International Group Inc. took controlling interest of the insurer.
</P>
<P>
   Investor Peter Salit claims in the suit filed in Los Angeles
Superior Court that officials of 20th Century, based in suburban
Woodland Hills, were fiduciarily irresponsible in failing to enact
a ``poison pill'' or other provision to ensure that New York-based
AIG would pay a premium for acquiring a controlling stake in the
company.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, which seeks class-action status to represent other
20th Century shareholders, would require company officials to
protect non-AIG investor interests. It does not specify how that
should be done.
</P>
<P>
   Salit could not be reached for comment on the suit. Ric Hill,
20th Century spokesman, said Salit's action is at best misguided,
though he added that the company has not seen the suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate that businesses in California have to operate
in an environment where individuals, often for financial reasons,
are permitted to maintain a garden variety of lawsuits to try to
extract money from them,'' Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   AIG in July took a controlling interest in 20th Century, 4{
years after bailing out the insurer when claims from the 1994
Northridge Earthquake devastated its balance sheet.
</P>
<P>
   AIG has slowly bought shares in 20th Century since then, and
this month exercised several million warrants for stock, taking its
ownership above the 50 percent mark. AIG officials earlier this
week asked 20th Century to dissolve its board of directors so they
can appoint new ones.

APPEALS COURT RULES THAT FDA CAN'T REGULATE CIGARETTES  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By BARRY MEIER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A federal appeals court ruled on Friday that the Food and Drug
Administration does not have the authority to regulate cigarettes
or smokeless tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling was a setback to anti-smoking groups, state attorneys
general and members of Congress who saw federal regulation as the
most potent weapon to reform the cigarette industry and control how
it marketed cigarettes to teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   In the 2-1 decision on Friday, a three-judge panel of the 4th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Va., overturned a
federal district judge's ruling of last year that upheld FDA
regulation of tobacco, a step that would allow government officials
to control cigarette nicotine levels.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the FDA declared that it had the authority to regulate
nicotine as a drug, and to regulate cigarettes as drug-delivery
devices. But the appeals panel ruled that the FDA needed explicit
authority from Congress to regulate tobacco products.
</P>
<P>
   In a 58-page opinion, the panel's majority wrote that there is
``strong evidence that Congress has reserved for itself the
regulation of tobacco products rather than delegating that
regulation to the FDA.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the Justice Department said on Friday that they
would appeal the ruling to the full appellate court. Some legal
experts said the question of tobacco regulation probably would end
up before the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday's decision was the latest in a string of recent
courtroom victories for cigarette makers, and even some
anti-tobacco advocates and lawyers said legal momentum might have
swung toward the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a reversal of three hard years of work by an awful lot
of people, and it didn't have to end up like this,'' said Richard
Scruggs, a lawyer from Pascagoula, Miss., who helped draft a
$368.5-billion settlement between cigarette makers and state
attorneys general that would have allowed FDA regulation. After the
settlement was taken up by Congress this year, it collapsed when
anti-tobacco advocates pressed for tougher sanctions against
cigarette makers.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, some lawyers and politicians who had helped draft
last year's deal said that Friday's decision suggested that
advocates may have miscalculated in pushing too hard in Congress
for harsher penalties against the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Other anti-smoking advocates downplayed the decision, saying it
had been rendered by a court in the heart of tobacco country.
Others said that they would try to use the decision to pressure
Congress to enact legislation that would grant the FDA full
authority over tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   ``This throws the ball back in Congress' court, and they have to
exercise their authority,'' said William Novelli, president of the
Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, an advocacy group in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, cigarette producers, who had challenged the
FDA's tobacco regulations, hailed the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are pleased by the court's ruling that the FDA does not
have the authority to regulate tobacco products and that the
agency's 1996 tobacco regulations are invalid,'' producers said in
a joint statement.
</P>
<P>
   The producers added that they ``remained committed to taking
meaningful steps to reduce underage tobacco use.'' The companies
were in the case included the Philip Morris Cos., R.J. Reynolds
Tobacco, a unit of RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp., Brown &AMP; Williamson
Tobacco Corp., a subsidiary of BAT Industries and Lorillard
Tobacco, a subsidiary of the Loews Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The decision will have no immediate impact on federal efforts to
regulate tobacco because it will be stayed pending appeal. But
should it withstand court challenges it could eliminate federal
money for programs intended to make it harder for young people to
buy cigarettes and would prevent any future efforts by FDA
officials to control nicotine levels in cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   More immediately, the decision could affect the new round of
settlement talks started recently between tobacco companies and
states that are suing producers to recover money spent treating
smoking-related illnesses.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Scruggs, the lawyer, said some state officials had been
demanding that producers drop their challenge to FDA authority in
exchange for legal peace. But now, he said, such demands were
likely to fall flat. ``The industry has the cards,'' he said.
``They stopped legislation. They stopped the FDA. They have the
momentum.''
</P>
<P>
   Scruggs and Christine Gregoire, the Washington state attorney,
said they blamed some anti-smoking advocates for pushing cigarette
makers too far in the recent debate in Congress over last year's
accord. Under that plan, which was reached on June 20, 1997,
tobacco companies, in return for protection against some
smoking-related lawsuits, agreed, among other things, to submit to
some federal regulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that history will reflect that June 20 was a golden
opportunity for major reform,'' Ms. Gregoire said.
</P>
<P>
   Some leading public health advocates like Dr. David Kessler, the
former commissioner of the FDA, had argued that the tobacco
regulations agreed to by industry negotiators last year were
inadequate. On Friday, Kessler, now the dean of the Yale University
Medical School, said he remained convinced that the courts would
eventually uphold the agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything that we learned from our investigation points to
the fact that nicotine is an addictive drug and nothing in this
opinion changes that,'' said Kessler. ``Nicotine fits the statutory
definition of a drug.''
</P>
<P>
   The stage for Friday's ruling was set when a federal judge in
North Carolina held last year that the FDA could regulate nicotine
as a drug and cigarettes as a drug-delivery devices, although he
denied the agency authority to control cigarette advertising.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge William L. Osteen Sr., in Greensboro, denied
the agency authority to control cigarette advertising.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, President Clinton hailed the ruling as a ``great
victory for the fight we have been waging for our children's
health.''
</P>
<P>
   While Osteen held that the FDA had the authority to regulate
tobacco because Congress had not clearly evidenced its intent to
withhold such power, the panel's majority said the question should
have been whether lawmakers had expressly delegated such powers to
the agency.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's decision was the latest legal victory chalked up by
cigarette producers. On Thursday, a Florida court raised doubts
about a landmark $1-million verdict against Brown &AMP; Williamson
Tobacco in a lawsuit brought by a smoker when it ruled that the
action should have been tried in the country where the smoker
lived.

MGM MONEY PROBLEMS DRIVING AWAY INVESTORS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE McNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Hopes that the legendary Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer
studio will survive have dimmed in recent weeks, with investors
backing away from the struggling studio.
</P>
<P>
   MGM shares have lost nearly 25 percent of their value since July
29, when they traded at $20 a share, matching the price of November
1997's initial public offering. It closed Friday at $15.1875, down
$0.1875, at the lowest price since the IPO.
</P>
<P>
   The decline reflects a trio of concerns -- whether MGM can
compete effectively while spewing red ink, whether anyone will buy
the cash-starved studio, and the share dilution from a coming
rights offering to raise $250 million.
</P>
<P>
   The latest chapter in the long-running MGM drama unfolded with
the Aug. 5 disclosure that the studio had held buyout talks with
unidentified companies, believed to include Time Warner Inc., The
Walt Disney Co. and News Corp.
</P>
<P>
   News of a possible sale caused a slight run-up of the stock the
next day, but two other announcements -- a halt of new TV program
development and the disclosure that MGM had only $132 million left
of a $1.3 billion credit line issued in October 1997 -- dampened
any bullishness.
</P>
<P>
   Several analysts have concluded that billionaire Kirk Kerkorian,
who controls 65 percent of MGM, may not necessarily sell MGM for a
third time but rather forge a partnership with a major TV power.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see the announcements as a signal that Kirk is
throwing in the towel,'' said Stewart Halpern, an analyst with ING
Barings Furman Selz. ``It's more in line with the strategy of a
joint venture giving MGM direct access to cable or enough clout to
get programs on to additional channels. That's consistent with what
MGM has been saying they would do all along.''
</P>
<P>
   Halpern, who retains a ``buy'' rating, said MGM's outlook will
improve in 2000 when it regains some of the TV rights to a large
portion of the MGM library from Time Warner.

 &HT;    Braves notebook: Jones has a flip side for almost everything
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Andruw Jones had just one single through the first
11 games of August.
</P>
<P>
   That's the downside. The upside: he hit three doubles, a triple
and four home runs, driven in eight runs and stole two bases. As
with everything else with Jones' 1998, there's another side. Add in
the fact that he's a leading candidate for a Gold Glove and the
same player that has burned Bobby Cox's biscuits several times this
season remains a central cog to his team.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a good level,'' Jones assessed his season. ''Well, it's
not a good level. It's an alright level.''
</P>
<P>
   When play began Friday night, Jones was tied for the NL outfield
assists (14, with Pittsburgh's Jose Guillen). He was tied for the
NL triples lead (8, with Arizona's Karim Garcia) with eight. He led
the Braves in doubles (26) and stolen bases (15) and while his next
strikeout will he his 100th, his 214 total bases were third only to
Chipper Jones and Andres Galarraga.
</P>
<P>
   ''He doesn't swing easy,'' said Cox, ''that's for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   What Jones continues to lack is consistency, his average
traveling from .250 to .270 and back down again all season. He is
far from the .231 hitter of 1997 but he has yet to show the .300
dependablity he did through 1,200 minor league at-bats. The start
of this seasn probably prevented that, after Jones suffered through
a dreadful .204 April that included a 2-for-40 start.
</P>
<P>
   Jones opened the Dodgers series at .259. Since April, he has hit
.274.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not good to slump any time but if you're going to slump,
it's better to slump early,'' Jones said. ''It's hard to have a
good season when you slump in the middle. My point is, if I need to
struggle, I hope it's early in the year and then come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Bye-Bye Byrd
</P>
<P>
   Paul Byrd was claimed by the Philadelphia Phillies Friday, a
casualty of the Norm Charlton acquision, stamping a final grade on
the Greg McMichael trade of 21 months ago. Byrd, who had been 5-5
with a 3.69 ERA in 17 starts this year with Class AAA Richmond, had
been designated for assignment when the Braves purchased Charlton's
contract Tuesday and needed to open a spot on the 40-man roster.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd had just one Atlanta appearance this season (two runs given
up in two innings April 19 in Colorado) and finished his Braves
stint at 4-4 with a 5.56 ERA in 32 appearances. His future with the
club never recovered from the great 1997 bullpen purge, when he was
sent down July 12, 1997, in a group transaction that brought Kevin
Millwood, Mike Cather and Chad Fox to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the Braves no have nothing to show for dealing away
McMichael, their primary set-up man from 1996 whom they sent to the
New York Mets for Byrd.
</P>
<P>
   No. 20
</P>
<P>
   In the last of a sequence of salutes for making the Hall of
Fame, Braves broadcaster Don Sutton's number 20 was retired by the
Los Angeles Dodgers in a ceremony before Friday night's game.
Though Sutton pitched for five major league clubs, 15 of his 23
seasons spent with the Dodgers. He joins Pee Wee Reese (1), Tommy
Lasorda (2), Duke Snider (4), Jim Gilliam (19), Walter Alston (24),
Sandy Koufax (32), Roy Campanella (39), Jackie Robinson (42) and
Don Drysdale (53) as the only Dodgers with retired numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Going to Cooperstown or winning 300 games, I could pre-plan,''
Sutton said. ''If I do this and that, I'll win 300 games. And if I
win 300 games, I'll probably go to the Hall of Fame. But this is
something I could ever plan for or think about or hope for. I don't
think a ball club can give a better pat-on-the-back than this. All
I ever wanted was someone to say, thanks for the effort. This far
exceeds that.''
</P>
<P>
   Thou shalt not surf
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Klesko came home this weekend and all he could do was
watch. A TV crew had hoped to take Klesko out to the beach and film
him surfing some of the spots he surfed as a kid. But as stipulated
in the four-year contract he signed with the Braves last winter,
Klesko cannot surf during the season, due to the physical risks.
Klesko went out to Huntington Beach Friday anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ''I brought my surfboard. It was awfully tempting,'' he said.
''So I sat on the beach and moped. I watched a surf contest, ate a
bagel and read the newspaper.''

 &HT;    Singh leads the pack at PGA Championship
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDMOND, Wash. _ Vijay Singh has another chance to be known as
something more than a driving range machine. Taking his practice
game to the course Friday, Singh equaled the Sahalee Country Club
course record of 66 established Thursday by Tiger Woods and grabbed
the early midway lead in the 80th PGA Championship at 4-under-par
136.
</P>
<P>
   The 35-year-old from Fiji, who led the 1993 PGA at Inverness,
eventually finishing fourth and two strokes behind Paul Azinger,
pounded Sahalee on a day when tight pin placements often took
scores in the other direction. Erupting for a front-nine 30, Singh
assumed a one-stroke lead on a cluster of players that included
non-PGA Tour winner Scott Gump (69) and Scotland's Colin
Montgomerie, who bogeyed the difficult 18th for 3-under 67.
</P>
<P>
   First-round leader Tiger Woods shot a 2-over 72 to stand two
shots back at 138 along with 1995 champion Steve Elkington (69),
Andrew Magee (68) and Brad Faxon (68).
</P>
<P>
   Singh's nemesis is always the putter, which he currently is
handling with a left-hand-low approach, but Friday it treated him
kindly, allowing no three-putts. His longest birdie putt was from
20 feet on the 7th; his shortest from four feet on No. 1 and No. 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm putting well,'' Singh said. ``I have a good feel for the
greens. That's a good thing to have going into the weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   Montgomerie, desperate for a major, wasted his opportunity to
also equal the course record and tie Singh by bogeying the 475-yard
18th. Fresh off a putting lesson from Dave Pelz that corrected
serious alignment problems, Montgomerie built momentum on the back
nine by sinking a 25-footer for a birdie at the 14th and a
15-footer at the 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although I'm not hitting the ball very well,'' said
Montgomerie, ``I'm still hitting it fairly straight. If I can putt
the same way on the weekend, I obviously have a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Billy Andrade, who started the day tied for second after an
opening 68 as the eighth alternate, slipped to a 77 and is at
5-over 145.
</P>
<P>
   Singh hit nine of 14 fairways, 14 of 18 greens and used 29
putts. After the flawless front nine, he made two bogeys on the
back nine. In the 1993 PGA, Singh registered a record 63 in the
second round, but then stalled over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pressure of a major is always different than a normal
tournament,'' Singh said, ``and I'm just going to go out there and
try to feel like (it's) a normal tournament as much as I can.''
</P>
<P>
   Gump, who tied for 79th last year in his first PGA Championship,
got to 5-under, then bogeyed the 15th and 16th. Gump did not play
in the year's other majors, but does not sound unnerved by the
situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pressure to me is how well you're playing,'' said Gump. ``If
I'm playing well, not much is going to bother me. ... I lost my
(PGA Tour) card and had to get my card back on the Nike Tour.
That's pressure. Leading a tournament, that's fun.''

NORTHRIDGE TO GET J.C. ALL-AMERICAN HARRIS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Junior college All-American Rico Harris is
expected to enroll at Cal State Northridge and play basketball for
the Matadors this season, a source said.
</P>
<P>
   A 6-foot-9 forward from Temple City High School, Harris
initially signed with Arizona State in 1995 but was academically
ineligible as a freshman. In March 1996, he was arrested for
alleged involvement in a sexual assault case. No charges were
filed.
</P>
<P>
   Harris left ASU shortly thereafter and spent the past two
seasons at L.A. City College.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN coach Bobby Braswell declined to comment because Harris has
not signed a letter of intent and is a recruitable athlete until
the fall semester begins.
</P>
<P>
   Harris could not be reached for comment, but L.A. City coach
Mike Miller was surprised by the development.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first I've heard of it,'' Miller said. ``Nothing
against Northridge, but why would he go there? This is a kid that
Kentucky, Rhode Island and Connecticut were recruiting. He almost
went into the (NBA) draft. I had 17 NBA guys in here (last season)
looking at him.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's any truth to it, it was done without my
knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris orally committed to Rhode Island last summer but never
signed a letter of intent with Jim Harrick's Rams. He declared for

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Long-term Treasury rates fell to their lowest level
in 30 years Friday, but the stock market's increasingly painful
slide continued.
</P>
<P>
   The drop in yields and the decline in stocks could both be
traced to the economic crisis in Asia and the financial turmoil in
Russia, and the uncertainty they have fostered among U.S.
investors.
</P>
<P>
   With Friday's slump, the Standard &AMP; Poor's index of 500 stocks
is now down more than 10 percent from its high, the Wall Street
definition of a correction. The Nasdaq composite index, which is
dominated by technology stocks, and the Russell index of 2,000
smaller-company stocks have already fallen more than 10 percent.
And the Dow Jones industrial average is just points away.
</P>
<P>
   But even the weak performance reflected in these indexes hides
the damage in the broader market and the pain that many investors
have been feeling. According to Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, the
stocks that trade on the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq
market are down an average of 35 percent from their 52-week highs.
Twenty-five percent of the stocks are down 50 percent or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at the troops instead of the generals, you are
in a bear market,'' said Thomas Galvin, chief investment officer at
Donaldson, Lufkin, and an analyst who expects the market to recover
in the fall. ``And the question is: How long will it persist?''
</P>
<P>
   While stocks are tumbling, the Treasury market is rallying, and
for some that is not a positive signal. For most of the last three
and half years, the bond market and the stock market have moved in
the same direction, responding to the positives of low inflation
and strong earnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you see stocks down and bonds up, the message is there is
a problem ahead for the economy,'' said Hugh Johnson, chief
investment officer at First Albany Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks have been hurt as the economic drag from Asia reduces the
corporate earnings that investors watch so closely. And each new
company that now warns of lower earnings, as Ciena Corp. did on
Friday, has a bigger impact.
</P>
<P>
   Asia is also slowing growth here and around the world. In
addition, the drop in demand for important commodities like oil and
copper is helping keep inflation low. Both of these trends _ and
the millions of investors who are looking for a haven for their
money _ are helping bonds and are likely to push long-term rates
even lower in the months ahead, several analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The predominant underlying fundamentals of a slowing world
economy and lower inflation are the real drivers that are going to
be here next month and the month after that,'' said Dan Lokoszka,
portfolio manager, global fixed income, at Wells Capital Management
in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond finished at 5.54 percent,
down from 5.59 percent on Thursday and down from the previous low
of 5.58 percent on June 15. The price, which moves in the opposite
direction from the yield, rose 29/32, to 99 15/32.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the 10-year note, which is a benchmark for
mortgages, fell to 5.39, from 5.44 on Thursday, but it is still
above its low of 5.35 percent on June 15. The interest rate on
30-year mortgages has been below 7 percent for eight weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The trend toward slower growth because of Asia, said Mickey
Levy, chief economist at Nationsbanc Montgomery Securities, should
keep Federal Reserve Board policy-makers on hold when they meet
next week.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Robert DiClemente, chief U.S. economist at Salomon Smith Barney,
said he was working on scaling down his growth forecast for the
second half of the year. ``Big pockets of the world economy are
deteriorating around us,'' he said, adding that the yield on the
30-year bond could now move into a range of 5 percent to 5.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the stock market, the Dow fell 34.50 points, or 0.4 percent,
to 8,425, and is just 20 points away from a 10 percent correction.
The Dow had shot up almost 100 points at the opening, in part
because of a small rebound in the Russian markets and talks between
Russian officials and the United States and other countries about
more aid.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, officials in Hong Kong announced that they had
bought stocks to shore up the troubled market there. Rumors of the
announcement, which was made after the market closed, helped send
the Hang Seng index up 8.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But the Dow lost its gains in the afternoon and would have been
down even more except that the stock of J.P. Morgan, which was once
again the subject of new takeover speculation, jumped 8.2 percent,
adding about 38 points to the Dow.
</P>
<P>
   The S&AMP;P index dropped 12.16 points, or 1.1 percent, to 1,062.75
and is now down 10.4 percent from its high of 1,186.75. The Nasdaq
index fell 12.35 points, or 0.7 percent, to 1,790.19 and is off
11.1 percent from its high. The Russell index fell 1.04 points, or
0.3 percent, to 402.79. It is down 18 percent from its high and is
off 7.8 percent for the year. The other major indexes are still up
for the year: the Dow, 6.5 percent; the S&AMP;P, 9.5 percent, and the
Nasdaq, 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The question now is whether the retail investor, who has kept
the bull market going in past downturns by buying on the dips, will
step in again and, if so, when.
</P>
<P>
   Abby Joseph Cohen, the co-chairwoman of the investment policy
committee at Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., said investors are ``having a
hard time looking to September,'' when she thinks that the outlook
for earnings and the economy will be much better than it is now.
</P>
<P>
   Asia and the Clinton investigation are ``dominating our lives
right now,'' Galvin said. ``Speculation is rampant and the only
news is bad news.''

DAVIS OFFERS BASKETBALL WORKSHOP AT HOOP RANCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Where does Utah Jazz center Greg Ostertag go in the off-season
to learn the fine art of the sky hook?
</P>
<P>
   Where does former TCU sharpshooter Mike Jones go to turn himself
from an undrafted, too-slow-for-the-NBA shooter into a burgeoning
pro?
</P>
<P>
   They head out to the Basketball Ranch of Texas, where former
Mavericks guard Brad Davis helps pro players get better, teaches
would-be pros what they need to know to overcome the ``would-be''
and even works with youngsters wanting to make the high school
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been very helpful to my game,'' said TCU point guard
Prince Fowler, who has been a ranch hand for the past month. ``I
know I'd rather do those individual workouts with them, because
they know what they're talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   The Basketball Ranch of Texas is a joint venture by Davis and
business partner Herb Stephens, a longtime basketball-camp
instructor who was the girls coach at Paschal High School from 1981
to '86. And it's not really a ranch, but a one-on-one workshop
Davis and Stephens bring to their approximately 50 clients using
various sites throughout the Fort Worth-Dallas area. Their clients
include Ostertag; former TCU players Jones, James Penny and Dennis
Davis; SMU freshman Nigel Smith from Kennedale; and New Mexico
sophomore Greg Davis from Martin High School.
</P>
<P>
   Fowler, who has one season left with the Horned Frogs, has
already noticed some upgrades in his game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've learned how to get low with the ball, shoot the floaters
over 7-footers and make good decisions with a simple pass,'' he
said. ``I'm also getting better in terms of working on my footwork,
pulling up for my shot, and reading the defense.''
</P>
<P>
   The clients come mostly by word of mouth, Brad Davis said, and
pay $30 for every hour on instruction. He and Stephens teach
everything from the value of footwork, to the art of perfecting the
sky hook. That's what brought Ostertag to Davis and Stephens, as
well as wanting to improve his overall post play.
</P>
<P>
   Jones has been one of the program's greatest benefactors.
</P>
<P>
   After being shunned in the NBA draft in June because of his slow
footwork and inability to handle the basketball, Jones decided to
sign on with the Ranch. On Monday, he signed a one-year contract to
play basketball in Poland.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've helped a lot with my footwork and increased the depth
of my shooting, so I think it's a good deal,'' Penny said. ``As for
Mike, I know they helped him a lot with his quickness, because
after going through the program he was a lot faster getting through
his moves.''
</P>
<P>
   The Basketball Ranch of Texas is the brainchild of Stephens, who
started the concept with 12 clients 2 1/2 years ago. Stephens was
finally able to convince Davis to join him earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Basketball Ranch of Texas is more of a philosophy, and the
philosophy is we're going to teach fundamentals,'' Stephens said.
``Brad and I are so much alike in regards to teaching the
fundamentals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know every coach we've talked to say they spend so much time
on the team concept, and they don't have much time to work on the
individuals. Well, that's what we do.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephens formerly ran a basketball camp in Kentucky, and he once
had center Brad Daugherty as one of his campers. Stephens said he
continued to work with Daugherty when he became an All-American at
North Carolina and during his rookie season with the Cleveland
Cavaliers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brad (Daugherty) told me back then that I needed to be doing
this for a living,'' Stephens said. ``He said he got more out of
working with me than he did with anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   So Stephens listened to Daugherty. Now, he hopes he'll get a
chance to work with another local center _ the Mavericks' Shawn
Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a big believer that you have to put weight on him,''
Stephens said. ``We think we can get him in here and we can get him
going, because what I particularly specialize in is big people and
the hook shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis, who played for the Mavericks from 1980 to '92, said the
Basketball Ranch concept fits his busy schedule. Each client goes
through a one-hour workout _ 30 minutes with Davis and 30 minutes
with Stephens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every kid that comes in has a different need, and the first
time we have a kid for lessons we do evaluations for about the
first 15 minutes,'' Davis said. ``We talk to the kid, we talk to
his coach or his parents and see what they think he needs to work
on, and see what he thinks he needs to work on, and then we take it
from there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every hour it changes. Every kid comes in with a different
need, so it's fun.''

 &HT;    Orange crop will be smaller, forcasters warn
 &HT;    By Julie Waresh
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ This year's extended wet and dry spells
will mean a 10-percent decrease in Florida's upcoming orange crop,
according an influential consultant's forecast.
</P>
<P>
   The state's groves will produce 219.5 million 90-pound boxes of
oranges during the harvest season that starts in November,
Orlando-based Citrus Consulting International Inc. predicted in a
report to its grower clients Friday.
</P>
<P>
   That compares to this season's record 244 million boxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good news because there is a substantial amount of
inventory in the state of Florida right now,'' said Andy Taylor,
treasurer and controller for Caulkins Indiantown Citrus Co., which
grows primarily oranges on 16,000 acres in Martin County.
</P>
<P>
   A drop in orange output would end a two-year string of record
Florida harvests that has driven prices down and left storage tanks
full of surplus concentrate.
</P>
<P>
   As of Aug. 1, 175 million gallons of concentrated orange juice
were in storage, compared with 143 million gallons in storage at
this time last year, Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   The private forecast, historically the first reliable glimpse at
the coming crop, sent orange juice futures up 4 percent Friday.
Orange juice for September delivery closed Friday up more than 5
cents at $1.12 a pound on the New York Cotton Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Futures trader James Cordier said consumers can expect to see
that reflected in retail price hikes of up to 15 cents a gallon as
early as next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Retailers are very quick to raise prices at the local level,''
said Cordier, a trader with Allendale Inc. in St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Department of Agriculture releases its first forecast
Oct. 9.
</P>
<P>
   While extreme weather in the first half of the year stressed
trees and caused them to drop more fruit than usual, a harvest or
219.5 million boxes still would represent Florida's third-largest
crop ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't anybody panic,'' Taylor said. ``There is still a lot of
juice to drink.''

CLINTON MAY GIVE PUBLIC ADDRESS AFTER TESTIFYING 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton and his legal advisers wrestled
Friday with whether the president will speak publicly after he
describes his relationship with Monica Lewinsky to a federal grand
jury Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Emphasizing that no decisions have been made, Clinton allies
said he is leaning toward acknowledging some sexual contact with
the former White House intern to the grand jury and arguing that he
technically did not lie in an earlier sworn statement denying
sexual relations with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, an intense debate was underway among White House
officials and Clinton allies over whether he should give a brief,
public address once his unprecedented grand jury appearance was
over.
</P>
<P>
   One aide told The Associated Press there was a ``90 percent''
chance the president would speak publicly before flying to Martha's
Vineyard in Massachusetts on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, the White House declined to discuss the president's
strategy considerations for his session with prosecutors, who are
investigating whether he had sex with Lewinsky, lied about it when
questioned under oath in the Paula Jones lawsuit, and urged others
to cover up the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are going to speculate going into this weekend
about events on Monday,'' said White House spokesman Mike McCurry.
``But we don't know what is going to be asked. We obviously don't
know what's going to be answered.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's testimony Monday will be a central part of a report
independent counsel Kenneth Starr is preparing to send to Congress
outlining evidence of impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   The president is to sit down with prosecutors at 1 p.m., EDT, in
the Map Room, a ground-floor room at the White House where
President Roosevelt kept track of developments during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Grand jurors will view the session by closed-circuit television
from the federal courthouse 12 blocks away.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanying Clinton will be two of his private attorneys, David
Kendall and Nicole Seligman, and White House counsel Charles F.C.
Ruff.
</P>
<P>
   McCurry said the president would meet frequently with his legal
team through the weekend. ``I know that Mr. Kendall had been
somewhat concerned that he has not had the time (with Clinton) that
he had expected'' because the president has had to deal with the
Capitol shooting, the embassy bombings in Africa and the economic
crisis in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about reports that Clinton might acknowledge engaging in a
certain kind of sex with Lewinsky that would not contradict his
testimony in the Jones case, McCurry said he was uninformed. ``I
have no clue as to whether there is definitional jockeying going
on,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very clear to me that the people who do know aren't
talking,'' McCurry said. ``They're not talking to us, they're not
talking to you, and so all of this is guesswork.''
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton adopts the sex-but-no-lie strategy and limits how
much he has to say about sex, he could avoid contradicting
Lewinsky's account of their affair. In her grand jury testimony two
weeks ago, she reportedly described a dozen White House sexual
encounters with the president. She also reportedly testified that
they discussed ways to hide their relationship but that Clinton
never suggested she lie under oath.
</P>
<P>
   This strategy would involve Clinton seeking semantic shelter
behind a definition of sexual relations used when he was questioned
in the sexual harassment lawsuit filed against him by Jones. A
federal judge limited the definition of sex to: ``Contact with the
genitalia, anus, groin, breast, inner thigh or buttock of any
person with an intent to arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any
person.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton allies have argued privately that the definition does
not include oral sex, an ambiguity that reportedly has been debated
during meetings of the president's legal team.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton critics Friday likened the proposed sex-but-no-lie
strategy to his admission earlier this decade that he once smoked
marijuana but did not inhale.
</P>
<P>
   ``This strategy reinforces the impression that this fellow can
never be candid. It's a little too cute,'' said Bruce Fine, a
former associate deputy attorney general who has urged Congress to
convene impeachment hearings. ``If anything, this strategy could
make it worse for Clinton. It says this guy, even up to the 11th
hour, can't make a truthful contrition statement.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Ashcroft, a Missouri Republican with presidential
ambitions, said Clinton can't equivocate before the grand jury.
``His duty at his grand jury testimony on Monday is simple _ to
tell the truth,'' Ashcroft said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the president now testifies that he did have a sexual
relationship with Monica Lewinsky in the White House, it will mean
that he lied to the American public and that he lied on his oath in
court in the Paula Jones lawsuit,'' Ashcroft said.
</P>
<P>
   Former deputy White House counsel Lanny Davis, a longtime
Clinton ally, said the president ``will testify consistent with the
Paula Jones deposition, but I think he's likely to go somewhat
beyond that.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the president's position will be embraced by
the American public ``if he is perceived to be telling the truth,
whatever the truth is.''
</P>
<P>
   A new CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll found 56 percent of Americans
saying that if Clinton lied under oath as a witness in the Jones
case, that would be serious enough to consider removing him from
office. Only 31 percent said having a sexual relationship with
Lewinsky was serious enough to consider his removal.
</P>
<P>
   The poll of 1,276 adults conducted from Monday through Wednesday
has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.

CLINTON GEARS UP FOR TESTIMONY ON LEWINSKY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton has virtually cleared his
calendar this weekend to prepare for his grand jury testimony in
the Monica Lewinsky investigation on Monday afternoon. But he will
not decide whether to give a public address to the country until he
finishes answering prosecutors' questions on closed-circuit
television, White House officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's lead private attorney, David Kendall, has complained
that Clinton has spent almost no time preparing for the grand jury
session, a White House spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   As the president began to focus on his testimony, new details of
Ms. Lewinsky's grand jury testimony emerged Friday that could
complicate Clinton's predicament. Ms. Lewinsky, a 25-year-old
former White House intern, told jurors last week that she had
performed sex orally and manually on the president on several
occasions, said lawyers familiar with her testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and his lawyers have been seeking to craft a response to
questions about his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky that will not
leave him vulnerable to a perjury charge stemming from his earlier
denials, some of his advisers said. That strategy depends on a
relatively narrow definition of sexual relations approved by the
judge in the Paula Jones sexual misconduct lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   That definition said that a person engages in sexual relations
when that person ``knowingly engages in or causes contact with the
genitalia, anus, groin, breast, inner thigh or buttocks of any
person with an intent to arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any
person.''
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton were to argue that he believed whatever behavior
occurred between him and Ms. Lewinsky did not fit that definition,
senior advisers said it would likely be on the basis that he did
not touch those parts of her body. The president's advisers believe
the definition may not cover oral sex performed by one party.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the president's advisers say they have also discussed an
approach that would limit the potential damage of the testimony by
having the president decline to answer some questions that may be
put to him by prosecutors about the specifics of any intimate
contact with Ms. Lewinsky, citing privacy concerns.
</P>
<P>
   One adviser familiar with the deliberations said that Clinton
and his advisers have considered the feasibility of ``going only so
far and then drawing a line'' when asked to detail his relations
with Ms. Lewinsky. That person, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said that in this scenario, Clinton would admit to the
grand jury on Monday that he engaged in a sexual relationship with
Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton might demur about some specifics while arguing that
he believed the specific conduct did not fit the definition of
sexual relations that he was given on Jan. 17 when he testified
that he had not engaged in such conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Clinton can explain the nature of any physical
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, he still faces questions about
possible obstruction of justice arising from the disposition of
gifts he gave her and efforts to find her a job after she was
subpoenaed to testify in the Jones lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's testimony will be taken on Monday beginning at 1 p.m.
in the Map Room on the ground floor of the White House, a room
where he has given depositions in other Whitewater-related cases
and that he used for dozens of fund-raising coffees in 1995 and
1996.
</P>
<P>
   He will be questioned by prosecutors from the office of Kenneth
Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel conducting the Lewinsky
investigation. In a rare concession negotiated by Clinton's
lawyers, the president will be allowed to have his lawyers by his
side. Accompanying Clinton will be Kendall; Nicole Seligman, a
partner of Kendall; and Charles Ruff, the White House counsel.
Ordinarily, grand jury witnesses are not permitted to have their
lawyers in the room with them.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall and Starr negotiated the terms of the testimony,
including its length. It was agreed that the president would
complete his testimony on Monday afternoon, making himself
available for about three to four hours of questioning. But Mike
McCurry, the White House spokesman, said that such sessions often
run long and there is ``no way of predicting when it will end.''
</P>
<P>
   The session will be transmitted live to the grand jury room on
the third floor of the federal courthouse 10 blocks from the White
House, where 23 private citizens have heard seven months of
testimony on the Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   McCurry said that the testimony would be transmitted by a
``one-way live feed,'' implying that grand jurors would not have
the opportunity to question the president, as they have previous
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   McCurry said that the session would also be videotaped and that
he presumed the tape would be the property of the grand jury, not
the White House. The White House Communications Agency, a military
unit that handles the president's secure communication and
audiovisual needs, will provide the cameras, cables and personnel
for the testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of Starr's office declined to comment on the
arrangements for the president's testimony.
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   McCurry dismissed as speculative a number of news accounts
previewing the president's Monday testimony, including one in The
New York Times on Friday, which said Clinton had discussed with his
inner circle the strategy of acknowledging to the grand jury sexual
encounters with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, a lot of people are going to speculate, going into this
weekend, about events on Monday,'' McCurry said at an afternoon
briefing. ``You don't know what the questions are; we don't know
what the questions are. You don't know what the answers are; we
don't know what the answers are the president will give. What the
president decides to say or decides not to say after the event on
Monday, we will, you know, let you know as soon as we can, when
it's over.''
</P>
<P>
   At the White House on Friday, the president's staff threw a
surprise birthday party for him on the South Lawn, sharing cake and
iced tea to celebrate Clinton's 52nd birthday on Aug. 19.
</P>
<P>
   The Marine Corps band performed a medley of tunes, including
snippets from the Beatles' ``Birthday'' and Roy Orbison's ``Pretty
Woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats sought on Friday to put the best face on Clinton's
deliberations over whether he should acknowledge to a grand jury on
Monday that he had sexual contact with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the party said that while such a move carries serious
political risks, they are hopeful the public would not particularly
care, given polls showing that most people already think the
president had an affair with the former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he were to step forward Monday and say, `There was
something between us,' I don't think anyone's going to fall away in
a dead faint at the news,'' said David Axelrod, a veteran
Democratic consultant in Chicago. ``That would be one of the least
surprising revelations in recent political memory.''
</P>
<P>
   George Stephanopoulos, the former senior adviser to Clinton,
said that ``there are no good strategies now,'' but that if the
president acknowledges his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, he might
finally be able to put the scandal behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will people be disappointed? Yes,'' said Stephanopoulos, a
commentator for ABC News. ``Will they be happy it's over with? Yes.
But in a world of bad options, it's always better to say more and
accept responsibility.''

BRUINS OWNER TRYING TO BUY CLEVELAND BROWNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GREGG KRUPA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Jeremy Jacobs, owner of the Boston Bruins and chairman
of the concessions behemoth Delaware North, is vying to own the
National Football League's Cleveland Browns franchise, which is due
to begin playing in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Sources in the NFL, Boston, and Cleveland said Jacobs has
notified the league of his interest by letter and has met with
commissioner Paul Tagliabue once or twice to discuss it. Jacobs is
expected to be among several groups of prospective Browns owners
who will make presentations to the other NFL owners beginning
Wednesday in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Aiello, a spokesman for the NFL, said the owner of the
expansion team is likely to be selected by the second or third week
of September.
</P>
<P>
   Consistent with his low profile, Jacobs was unavailable for an
interview, and a spokeswoman for Delaware North said there would be
no public comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really can't comment on it,'' said the spokeswoman, Brenda
Fullmer. ``I really don't know what Mr. Jacobs is doing in this
regard. He's not talking to me about it and he has made it clear
that he does not want to talk to anybody else about it, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs has mounted drives twice to own the New England Patriots,
in 1974 and 1993. And last August, in an interview with the Globe,
Jacobs made it clear he is strongly interested in owning another
sports franchise, especially one close to Delaware North's
corporate headquarters in Buffalo, N.Y. Cleveland is about 160
miles away, across a corner of Lake Erie. In the interview, Jacobs
specifically mentioned the Celtics, the Patriots, the Red Sox, and
the Buffalo Bills as franchises he would be interested in owning,
if available.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's really gone after it,'' said a prominent player in the
Boston sports scene, who, like several others who confirmed
Jacobs's involvment in a bid for the Browns, asked not to be
identified. ``There has been at least one meeting with Tagliabue,
possibly two, and he has submitted a letter _ as all other
prospective ownership groups have _ declaring his interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next step is a formal presentation before the other
owners,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL's Aiello would say only that, ``There are a number of
groups involved who have made their interest known, publicly. In
addition, there are a few groups pursuing the ownership of the
Browns who have not identified themselves publicly, and who would
prefer to remain anonymous, at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials close to the purchase of the Browns, including some
businessmen in the prospective ownership groups, expect formal
bidding to begin at about $300 million and to rise quickly to $500
million and perhaps substantially more.
</P>
<P>
   As a professional sports franchise ,the situation in Cleveland
is nearly ideal. After former owner Art Modell moved the team to
Baltimore, where they play as the Ravens, both the NFL and civic
leaders in Cleveland and Ohio have done all that they can to smooth
the way for a new Browns team.
</P>
<P>
   A new 72,000-capacity stadium is under construction, financed
entirely by money from the city, state, county a regional transit
authority, a loan from a local business association called
Cleveland Tomorrow and the National Football League. There will be
113 luxury suites that will help maximize the profitability of the
franchise. The team's base of fan support appears to have not
diminished since the Browns left in 1995 and the team, which joined
the NFL in 1950 under the leadership of Hall of Fame coach and
owner Paul Brown, is among the most storied franchises in the
history of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs' quest is clouded by the presence of several powerful
competitors for the ownership, all of whom have deep pockets and
several of whom have substantial roots in Cleveland. Jacobs' only
connection appears to be that one of the Delaware North companies,
Sport Service, provides the concessions at Jacobs Field.
</P>
<P>
   Among the publicly-known ownership groups interested in the
Browns are:
</P>
<P>
   _ Two brothers, Charles Dolan, the founder and chairman of
Cablevision System Corp., the sixth largest cable operator in the
US, and Larry Dolan, the president and managing partner of
Thrasher, Dinsmore &AMP; Dolan, a prominent Ohio law firm, have joined
forces with the entertainer Bill Cosby, who would own 5 percent of
the team.
</P>
<P>
   Cablevision is partners with ITT Corp. in the ownership of the
Madison Square Garden Properties, including the New York Knicks and
Rangers as well as the Madison Square Garden television network.
</P>
<P>
   Hall of Fame coach and former Browns player Don Shula has been
involved with the Dolan group, and could emerge in a front office
positions. Shula was born in Plainesville, Ohio, 25 miles up the
Lake Erie shoreline from Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   _ Banking executive Alfred Lerner, a former minority-stake owner
in the Browns. Lerner is allied with the former, popular Browns
Quarterback Bernie Kosar. Cleveland Mayor Michael White as endorsed
Lerner's bid.
</P>
<P>
   Lerner's bid got a big boost late last month when Carmen Policy
resigned as president and chief executive of the San Francisco
49ers and joined Lerner as chief executive and equity partner.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cleveland-area real estate developer Bertram Wolstein.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cleveland Indians owner Richard E. Jacobs, who is no relation
to Jeremy. Richard Jacobs is one of the country's largest
developers of shopping malls.
</P>
<P>
   Also involved are Tom Murdough, a wealthy former owner of Little
Tykes toys, New Yorker Howard Milstein and another group whose most
prominent member are the former Cleveland Browns Paul Warfield and
Calvin Hill.

<P>
   Last fall, when the stock market fell more than 10 percent below
its high for the first time since 1990, the reason was clear.
Currency devaluations in Asia had aroused fears that falling export
prices would hurt the profits of companies in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Ten months later, stock prices have again fallen 10 percent,
from a higher peak, and the downturn can again be traced in part to
worries about the Asian malaise.
</P>
<P>
   But there are significant differences to the most recent decline
_ a decline that has some people on Wall Street thinking that the
bull market's long run has finally ended.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, analysts worried about a slowdown in corporate
profits. Now they see dozens of companies actually reporting
earnings shortfalls. One by one, historical yardsticks used to
value stocks have toppled old records, leaving few measures by
which this is not the most expensive market ever.
</P>
<P>
   And though the broad market indexes have declined 10 percent,
thousands of stocks are 20 percent or more below their peaks.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the signs are so foreboding.
</P>
<P>
   The employment boom has continued with little, if any, upward
pressure on wages. Banks appear to be well-capitalized against
possible losses in Asia and have little exposure to troubled
markets in Eastern Europe. Though corporate profits are growing
more slowly than in recent years, they are growing.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Wall Street's most astute investors say that means stock
prices should end the year well above their current levels.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to pin the cause of the recent decline on any single
factor is as impossible as determining where the market is headed
next. But it might be useful to review just what has all of Wall
Street so upset.
</P>
<P>
   Herewith, a survey of key factors in the recent turmoil, as well
as some thoughts about outside factors that could send the market
scrambling. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   A History Lesson &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Major Indexes, A Long Way to Doom &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For years, both the returns generated by stocks and the
valuations that investors assigned to them have vastly exceeded
levels experienced throughout market history. Some argue that
outsized valuations are simply a result of a new era of investing
in which the old rules no longer apply. These folks are happy to
pay 200 times earnings for America Online.
</P>
<P>
   For the rest of us here on planet Earth, a little dose of
reality now comes from the market watchers at the Leuthold Group in
Minneapolis. They have collected data back to 1926 on two indexes:
the Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard &AMP; Poor's
industrials (not the S&AMP;P 500-stock index).
</P>
<P>
   Let's begin with where we are now, based on two common measures:
price-earnings ratios and average dividend yield, or the amount of
dividends paid by the companies in the group divided by the total
price of those companies' stocks.
</P>
<P>
   As of Friday, the Dow stood at 8,425. It carried a p/e ratio of
21, and dividends paid by the stocks in the Dow group yielded an
average 1.75 percent. The S&AMP;P industrials closed the week at
1,252.60. Its price-earnings ratio was 29; its dividend yield, 1.35
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Over 72 years, the median p/e ratio on the Dow has been 15.3.
How far off that median are we now? For the Dow to return to that
valuation level, it would have to drop 37 percent, to 5,291.
</P>
<P>
   The median dividend yield on the Dow has historically been 4.3
percent, more than double what it is now. For dividend yield
valuations to revert to their median, the Dow would have to fall to
3,353, or 60 percent below its Friday close.
</P>
<P>
   If the S&AMP;P industrials reverted to the historical norm as
measured by p/e, this index would lose about half its value,
falling to 634. If measured by dividend yield, the index would
collapse to 445, a fall of 64 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, market experts don't think the averages will plunge
to levels anywhere near their historical medians. And with most
Americans certain that the stock market is the best place to put
their money, continued demand for equities could keep their prices
in the stratosphere.
</P>
<P>
   The Leuthold Group has compiled another set of numbers that goes
back to 1957 and includes only those periods when inflation was
low. If the Dow Jones industrials were to trade at the median p/e
ratio during periods of low inflation, it would fall to 5,972, a
decline of 29 percent. The S&AMP;P industrials would have to drop 37
percent, to 788.
</P>
<P>
   The old rules may indeed no longer apply to our brave new
market. Still, it is better to know what history has to say than to
ignore it. &QL;

   The Small Investor &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Still Holding On, On a Bumpy Road &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Amid all the gloom and doom about falling share prices, one
particular bright spot has been the little guy: small investors
have shown few signs of jumping ship.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence this summer suggests that large institutional
investors, like hedge funds and mutual funds, have been the
aggressive sellers of domestic equities, sending trading volume to
new heights. But the small investor, though concerned and a bit
jittery, seems to be doing just what the fund brochures advise:
holding on through the bumps and bruises, and then buying more
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1997, then again last October and in April this year,
smaller investors rushed in to save a swooning stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Data from Birinyi Associates, a market research firm in
Greenwich, Conn., show that the little guys, those trading fewer
than 10,000 shares, have been buyers recently, while those trading
10,000 or more, the institutions, have been sellers.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, individuals seem to have abandoned small-company stocks in
favor of blue chips and the index funds that mimic them. Until the
last month, that pushed up key indexes, even as the broader market
lagged behind or fell, reducing the breadth of the bull market. But
the shift has been more a rush to safety and performance than a
rush to the exits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The individual investor is much less emotional than the
supposed professional money managers,'' said Alfred Goldman, chief
market strategist at A.G. Edwards Inc. in St. Louis. ``The
individual investor decided years ago to take the long-term outlook
and to give up on the vagaries of the market. Are they ecstatic
about the last few weeks? No. But they are buyers.''
</P>
<P>
   So as a bearish cry goes out from Wall Street analysts,
portfolio managers and purveyors of market gloom, smaller investors
seem to be gearing up for Dow 10,000.

   A Global Drama: As the Yen Turns &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Now is the time to assess risks and rewards,'' said Mark
Mobius, the managing director of Templeton Asset Management. As he
headed off to Moscow this weekend, the list of risks was getting
longer.
</P>
<P>
   That list _ headed by the weakening Japanese yen, the threat of
a currency devaluation by China, the possibility of a Russian
devaluation and a deepening of the Asian economic crisis _ helped
send stocks lower around the world last week and dampened the
outlook.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are fleeing emerging markets, where the spillover from
either a Chinese or a Russian devaluation would hit hardest.
Brazilian stocks dropped 6.2 percent last week. Mexican stocks fell
6.8 percent, and the peso hit a record low against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   American investors do not think the piling on of bad news has
yet knocked the legs out from under the bull market. Many analysts,
while predicting volatility ahead, say they think the combination
of low inflation and resilient domestic growth will prevent that
from happening. In Europe, the outlook is also still positive.
</P>
<P>
   But the threats all but insure that the market volatility that
was rampant last week _ the Dow Jones industrial average down 112
points on Tuesday, up 90 points on Wednesday, down 93 points on
Thursday and down 34 points on Friday _ will continue.
</P>
<P>
   The yen remains the biggest risk. It is the barometer of Japan's
ability to turn around its own economy and, in turn, help all of
Asia back on its feet. It is Asia's drag on corporate earnings that
is disturbing investors in the United States and in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   In the minds of many investors, the yen has also become the
lever that could force the Chinese to devalue. So, as the yen
falls, that threat looms larger.
</P>
<P>
   After such a tumultuous week of bad news and short spells of
relief, investors might begin to wonder if things could begin to
unravel.
</P>
<P>
   Around the world, most stock markets are under pressure, as are
many economies. Can the United States and its allies prop up Russia
yet again? Can the Japanese government get its act together? Is
China playing politics, or is a devaluation ultimately in the
cards?
</P>
<P>
   That kind of uncertainty could unnerve the bulls. &QL;

   The Economy &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Signs of Health And Rays of Hope &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With the 1990s economic expansion poised to enter the record
books as the longest ever in peacetime, it is shifting gears from
the heady pace of the last two years to a more sedate one. Whatever
negatives may be at work, the economy may well be a stabilizing,
not destabilizing, influence for financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the downshifting is a bit scary. Anytime the economy
slows sharply, it becomes more vulnerable to outside shocks _ from
a military confrontation with Iraq to impeachment proceedings
against the president to a stock market dive. This time, investors
are focusing on the implications of slower growth for profits.
</P>
<P>
   But the slowdown was inevitable. Did anyone really believe that
the economy, already having achieved the lowest unemployment rate
in 28 years, could keep barreling along indefinitely? And a
deceleration is just as likely to keep the expansion alive as it is
to kill it off.
</P>
<P>
   If the Asian crisis had not come along to cool the economy, the
Federal Reserve would probably have raised interest rates _ and it
could easily, as in the past, have raised them too much.
</P>
<P>
   The economy is healthier than it has been in decades. Compare
1998 with 1989, when inflation was picking up and the Fed was
raising interest rates. The savings and loan crisis was in full
bloom. Federal deficits stretched to the horizon. Consumers were up
to their eyeballs in debt.
</P>
<P>
   Now, government, banks and consumers are in better financial
shape, inflation is low, interest rates are falling and the dollar
is gaining strength. The recession in Asia, serious as it is, isn't
likely to pull the United States down, too.
</P>
<P>
   The world's big economies, as the last 20 years have shown,
aren't that synchronized. More important, the domestic side of the
American economy, which accounts for 85 percent of economic
activity, still has real momentum.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers and home buyers, particularly, are apt to keep
spending, even if at a more moderate pace. Jobs are plentiful,
incomes are rising smartly after inflation and taxes, and total
household net worth is up $12 trillion from just four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder consumers' spirits remain so upbeat. Businesses still
have the means to add to inventories and invest in new technology.
Cash flow is ample. Wage pressures remain moderate. Labor costs are
creeping up a bit faster, but productivity is growing at a good
clip, despite the dip during the General Motors strike. There is
also the added bonus of cheaper energy and raw materials.

   In short, if something comes along to knock the stock market
down, chances are it won't be the economy. &QL;

<P>
   Any Big Surprise Can Bring On a Bear &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If investors can be blithe in good times, they can be squeamish
in bad. Especially when the market is trying to decide which way to
go, outside events are often the shock that sets off a bear market.
</P>
<P>
   It happened in 1973, when the worst postwar bear market
coincided with the resignation of President Richard M. Nixon.
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990 also sent the market into a
spiral.
</P>
<P>
   And this year? Prepare for the unexpected. Any sharp negative
surprise in world affairs _ whether an earthquake in Japan that
shakes any remaining hope for an early recovery there or a setback
in European plans for a unified currency that topples the
continent's high-priced markets _ could be the catalyst for a
prolonged slump here.
</P>
<P>
   Stock strategists see a few such hairpin turns ahead that will
test investors' ability to stay the course. Here are two of them: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE BOMB The Millennium Bomb, that is, also known as Y2K. Edward
Yardeni, chief economist of Deutsche Bank Securities, has been
warning that companies and governments are still a long way from
meeting the challenge of updating computers to solve the year-2000
problems.
</P>
<P>
   More to the point, the potential for the issue to unnerve market
investors is growing.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. recently disclosed that it would spend $375
million repairing its own computer systems, $100 million more than
anticipated. As other companies come to grips with the costs,
Yardeni says, investors will receive a slew of unpleasant earnings
surprises that could sap confidence in the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Y2K is in the market at all,'' Yardeni said.
``In this kind of market, people are looking for risk and
uncertainty. One of the biggest threats to earnings is the year
2000.''
</P>
<P>
   THE PRESIDENT The stock market has learned to live with White
House scandals, which have grown more serious in tandem with one of
the greatest bull markets in history.
</P>
<P>
   But Bill Dinning, a Merrill Lynch strategist, thinks that such
instability is not merely inside-the-beltway intrigue but gets more
important the farther one goes from Washington.
</P>
<P>
   That is because President Clinton is the linchpin for $56
billion in loans to 59 emerging markets from the International
Monetary Fund. Some of those loans are lifelines to countries like
South Korea, Thailand and Russia that are struggling to forestall
economic meltdowns.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton resigned, or saw his authority further weakened by
enduring investigations and sharp Republican victories in coming
elections, the political underpinnings of those loans could
collapse, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. has played a significant role with the bailouts,''
Dinning said. ``If the president is paralyzed by political and
legal problems, people will have less faith that these economic
adjustments are going to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Given that the United States has been a bastion of stability for
the world, that is the kind of surprise of which bear markets could
be made. &QL;

   From its peak on July 17 through last Tuesday, the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500-stock index returned a negative 9.9 percent. Several
mutual funds, however, managed to return a tidy profit, testimony
to the proliferation of bear-market funds, which sell stocks and
index futures short to help returns in such times.
</P>
<P>
   Small surprise, then, that a 44-point spread separates the
best-performing fund from the worst.
</P>
<P>
   One curiosity is the presence of the Crabbe Huson Special fund
at the top of the losers' list. It dropped 21.6 percent over the
period, despite the fact that it had been widely pilloried for big
short positions in such high-flying stocks as Dell Computer and
America Online.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be ironic if they had gotten out of those
positions,'' said Laura Lallos, a senior analyst with Morningstar
Inc., the Chicago financial publisher. The fund's
small-capitalization holdings clearly would have hurt it over the
period because such stocks were punished brutally.
</P>
<P>
   A Crabbe Huson spokeswoman said the fund's managers, who also
run the lagging Crabbe Huson Small Cap fund, were unavailable for
comment last week.
</P>
<P>
   The no-load shares of the Safeco Small Company Stock fund
finished second from the bottom, losing 20.3 percent, disrupting
what would have been an otherwise strong year-to-date performance.
The Safeco fund, which is 18 months old, got clobbered on two
stocks in particular.
</P>
<P>
   Penederm, the fund's largest holding, is being acquired by Mylan
Laboratories Inc. and was hit by a government investigation into
allegations of price fixing by Mylan and other generic-drug makers.
Penederm shares fell from $23 on July 16 to $16.375 on Aug. 5.
</P>
<P>
   And Stage Stores, a clothing retailer based in Houston, posted
dismal second-quarter sales results on Aug. 6 and said that it
would have trouble meeting third-quarter estimates. The company,
which represented 3.2 percent of Safeco's holdings, fell to a low
of $9.875 that day; it had traded as high as $53.75 in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will the names in the fund come back? I firmly believe so,''
said Greg Eisen, manager for Safeco Small Company Stock. ``When? I
don't know. I can only wait.''
</P>
<P>
   One new family of mutual funds found itself on both lists. The
Profunds Ultra Bear fund returned 22.9 percent between July 17 and
last Tuesday, while the Profunds Ultra Bull lost 19.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Sapir, chief executive of Profunds, said the funds,
started last November, did exactly what they were supposed to do.
Profunds Ultra Bear, using options on stock index futures, is
intended to deliver a return that is equal to twice the negative
performance of the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index.
</P>
<P>
   Profunds Ultra Bull is the mirror image of the Ultra Bear, using
derivatives as it seeks to double the S&AMP;P 500's positive returns.

ANONYMOUS TIPS FED NICOTINE BATTLE

 (HLW)  
 By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ This city is rife with anonymous sources. So it
might come as no surprise that when the Food and Drug
Administration set out to determine whether it could regulate
nicotine as a drug, its first big break came from a tobacco
industry informant.
</P>
<P>
   He called himself Deep Cough. To this day, his identity remains
a secret.
</P>
<P>
   Deep Cough surfaced at the food and drug agency in January 1994.
A former manager at the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., he had been
taken to the agency by Cliff Douglas, a lawyer and advocate of
controls on tobacco. In conference calls and meetings, Douglas said
on Friday, Deep Cough described for agency officials the steps that
tobacco companies took to control the precise levels of nicotine in
cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   It was, at the time, an explosive disclosure. It set in motion a
bitter legal and regulatory battle with the tobacco industry over
whether the food and drug agency could take jurisdiction over the
marketing and sale of cigarettes. Now, the fight Deep Cough helped
begin is probably headed for the Supreme Court; a federal appeals
court ruling on Friday denied the FDA the regulatory control it
seeks.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Deep Cough landed on the agency's doorstep, Dr.
David Kessler, then commissioner of food and drugs, and his top
aides had spent several years considering whether and how they
might regulate nicotine. The Coalition on Smoking or Health,
comprising several public health groups, had been pressing the
government to regulate cigarettes since the late 1980s. To do so,
the drug agency would have to prove that the tobacco companies used
nicotine with the intent to ``affect the structure and function of
the body,'' the requirement the agency must meet under the Food,
Drug and Cosmetics Act.
</P>
<P>
   But, Kessler said, little was known about how cigarettes were
made; agency officials assumed that the companies simply rolled
nicotine in its natural state into cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we know today is very different from what we knew when we
started,'' he said. ``We had a few pieces of the puzzle. But we had
no sense of the vastness of how sophisticated the companies'
nicotine enterprises were.''
</P>
<P>
   Deep Cough was the first of several informants who helped
provide that sense, Kessler said. On Feb. 25, 1994, Kessler sent a
letter to Scott Ballin, the coalition's chairman, suggesting the
agency would consider regulating tobacco. ``It is our
understanding,'' Kessler wrote, without mentioning Deep Cough,
``that manufacturers commonly add nicotine to cigarettes to deliver
specific amounts of nicotine.''
</P>
<P>
   The industry has repeatedly denied the accusation and has
maintained that the FDA has no right to regulate tobacco products.
</P>
<P>
   The next night, a Saturday, Kessler was perusing the reference
section of the Borders bookstore at a shopping mall in suburban
Washington when he ran into one of his associate commissioners,
Mitch Zeller.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are you doing for the next two weeks?'' Kessler recalled
asking Zeller, who replied, ``Whatever you want me to.''
</P>
<P>
   With Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., preparing to hold hearings on
tobacco, Kessler asked Zeller to head a formal inquiry into the
industry's practices. Before long, a small corps of agency
investigators were working the telephones, interviewing witnesses
and collecting documents.
</P>
<P>
   The congressional hearings were memorable, not only for the
televised image of seven tobacco industry executives swearing that
nicotine was not addictive, but also for the flood of documents and
additional informants they unleashed. Philip Schiliro, Waxman's
chief-of-staff, remembers an irate industry insider who, while
watching the hearings on television, called the congressman's
office with an anonymous tip about tobacco plants genetically
engineered to produce higher levels of nicotine. The tip, Schiliro
said, turned out to be true.
</P>
<P>
   ``People just called in to tell you things,'' Schiliro said,
``and in almost every case it turned out to be reliable
information.''
</P>
<P>
   Kessler recalled: ``It really was amazing. You would have
something you would think would be an enormous break, and then
there was something that was actually bigger. And then you started
seeing all these documents. And the documents didn't stop.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of 1994, the agency had collected enough information
to begin work drafting a proposed rule that would give it the
authority to regulate nicotine as a drug, and cigarettes as drug
delivery devices. The proposal was announced in August 1995; the
industry immediately sued, but the case was held in abeyance. After
a year of public comment and debate, the rule became final in
August 1996, and the lawsuit, which prompted Friday's ruling, went
forward.
</P>
<P>
   As for Deep Cough, ``he went on to live his normal life,''
Douglas said. ``There is no way he could have known what he was
helping to unleash. None of us did. We just knew that we thought it
was important.''

SEEING MORE MERGERS AS AN INDUSTRY ADJUSTS

<P>
   British Petroleum's agreement to buy Amoco for $48.2 billion,
announced last Tuesday, would be the largest oil company merger in
history and could lead to a scramble by rivals to find partners to
survive in an era of extraordinarily low prices.
</P>
<P>
   The decline in oil also has played a role in financial market
volatility _ contributing, for example, to the panicky selloffs in
Russia, where oil sales help repay foreign debts.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last week, Dr. Daniel Yergin, chairman of
Cambridge Energy Research Associates, discussed the implications of
the merger as well as the causes and consequences of the decline in
oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   Yergin won a Pulitzer Prize in 1992 for ``The Prize,'' a history
of the oil industry. More recently he was co-author, with Joseph
Stanislaw, of ``The Commanding Heights,'' an economic history of
the last half of the 20th century. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)What is the significance of a British
Petroleum-Amoco merger?(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Clearly this takes place in an environment of low prices,
which focuses the mind on long-term competitive position. I think
this merger is not about low oil prices, though. It really is about
strategic position, about how you can be competitive for the long
term, and getting the right resources, the reach and cost structure
you need to be competitive around the world. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Wasn't the depressed price of oil a catalyst for
this merger?(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. It added to the pressure in general. There was recognition
that it's going to be a tough competitive environment for a long
period, and the news out of Asia does not suggest a quick recovery
in oil prices by any means. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Are we likely to see more consolidation among oil
companies?(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. (italics)I think it forces everybody to go back and look at
what are they good at, what are they not good at, what would they
gain from mergers and consolidation. A lot of people will decide
that it's not necessary for them. But for others this will be a
triggering event. This just sort of transforms the competitive
landscape of the business.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Would you care to speculate on who is likely to
merge with whom? &QL; 
(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I'd better not. But I think everyone's going to go through a
re-examination of their competitive position. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Why have prices fallen so much?(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. There are a number of factors that came together. Obviously
the warm winter meant you had built-up inventories, and by last
March the situation started to get desperate because there was no
place to put the oil. But the fundamental cause is Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)How could Asia have such an impact?(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Fourteen months ago, the forecast for growth in Asian oil
demand was an additional one million barrels a day this year. Asia
was the new ``prize'' _ where you had to be, where the growth was.
At this point, we expect it to be down by 200,000 barrels a day for
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)What about overproduction?(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. That's the other factor. You basically have both OPEC and
non-OPEC countries continuing to produce, assuming the market would
absorb it. You have Iraq coming back. You have continuing buildup
of supply. When I finished ``The Prize,'' I thought of all the
hundreds of characters in the book and came to the conclusion that
only two characters really counted _ supply and demand. Now there's
too much supply and not enough demand.
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)The oil industry plans far ahead. Why didn't it see
the Asia crisis coming?(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I think there is a kind of modesty, actually, about oil
pricing forecasts. Until the mid-80s, there was a belief you could
forecast the future, and now people really see prices more as
assumptions rather than as actual forecasts. The IMF has
consistently underestimated _ everybody has consistently
underestimated _ the gravity of the Asia crisis. The oil industry
is in the same boat.
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Efforts earlier this year by OPEC and non-OPEC
producers to cut production appear to be doing nothing for prices.
Which oil-exporting countries are most at risk?(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The combination of the Asian economic crisis and the oil
crisis has hit Russia very hard because oil is such an important
source of its earnings. Venezuela has been very hard-hit. For any
of these countries that depend on oil for a substantial part of
national revenues, their revenue targets will fall far, far short.
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Low oil prices have helped keep inflation and
interest rates low, but what about the harm done in the United
States?(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. If you think back to the last price collapse, in 1986, the
difference was that there was much greater regional outcry about
low oil prices, and although this does hurt the energy sector, the
state of Texas is much more diversified now. Low oil prices, on the
other side, are kind of a central bank chairman's Christmas
present.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italic)From an investor's point of view, do you see
opportunities in depressed prices?(end italic) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The thing you have to keep in mind about the oil business is
that it is a commodity business. It's a business of cycles. When
prices are up people tend to think they're going to be up forever
and when they're down people think they're going to be down
forever.
</P>
<P>
   It is for now, in the next year or two, dependent on what
happens in Asia. That's a critical variable. One of the things that
strikes me about this industry is that it can, at $15 or $16 a
barrel, do things that it thought it couldn't do at $30 a barrel a
decade ago. It's an industry that's being transformed by technology
and computers. It's an industry that can do much better at lower
prices. It's an industry that's surprised itself. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italic)How low can prices get?(end italic) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Let me put it this way. I think the reason producers got
together and said, ``O.K., OPEC's not working; let's use some other
mechanism to cut production,'' was a recognition that there wasn't
much of a floor and you could be looking at single-digit prices
without some moderation of supply.
</P>
<P>
   The industry has gotten accustomed to producing 2 percent annual
volume growth, and what it's going through now is this very painful
process of recalibrating its output to a lower demand level, and
who's going to bear the cost of those cutbacks.

THREE NEW CASES OF `FLOCK WORKER'S LUNG` REPORTED
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DOLORES KONG  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three new cases of a recently identified occupational lung
disease have been reported in Rhode Island and Massachusetts among
textile mill workers, bringing the total number of ``flock worker's
lung'' to 13 in the two states since its discovery.
</P>
<P>
   Since May, the respiratory disorder has been diagnosed in three
men in their 20s and 30s by a University of Massachusetts Medical
Center physician and a Brown University researcher who discovered
the disease but was fired for insisting on his right to publicize
the finding.
</P>
<P>
   The two Rhode Island cases were diagnosed in May and July among
employees at the Pawtucket plant of Microfibres Inc., despite the
company's two-year effort to address scientists' and regulators'
concerns about a link between the ailment and making flocked fabric
for upholstery.
</P>
<P>
   The new cases ``must raise questions about the company's medical
surveillance and engineering interventions to date,'' said Dr.
David G. Kern, who was fired by Memorial Hospital of Rhode Island
last year. Kern remains at the hospital temporarily, and continues
to look for another job.
</P>
<P>
   John Woodhouse, spokesman for Microfibres, the world's largest
flocked fabric maker, said the firm has done everything recommended
by federal regulators and remains committed to solvingthe problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a case of a company that is doing everything that we
can think of, and everything that anybody else seems to be able to
think of. Yet still, the nature and the cause of this condition
still eludes the best minds and the best experts,'' Woodhouse said.
Microfibres had initially hired Kern as an occupational health
consultant, but terminated his contract after he insisted on
publicizing his findings.
</P>
<P>
   Kern's battle to present his findings at a scientific meeting
last year drew support from occupational health specialists and
highlights increasing worries about research results being quashed
by industry and medical institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Other physicians welcomed Kern's willingness to face the
obstacles and cited benefits in their work.
</P>
<P>
   Last Monday, Dr. Glenn Pransky of the University of
Massachusetts Medical Center diagnosed his latest patient with the
occupational lung disease. The center brought two others to the
attention of federal researchers earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Pransky would not say where his patients live, or which textile
plants they work at, citing patient confidentiality.
</P>
<P>
   Pransky credited Kern for helping these patients get properly
diagnosed through the UMass occupational and environmental health
program. ``Had Dr. Kern not decided to come forth and publicize
this information, for all we know, these people might ... be
dead,'' said Pransky, who heads the program.
</P>
<P>
   The two latest Rhode Island cases are in addition to eight
others among Microfibres' employees that Kern identified and
reported to state and federal occupational health officials since
1996. Kern and colleagues report more details about those first
eight cases in today's Annals of Internal Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   While Kern has reported these two other cases to state, federal
and company officials, Woodhouse said only one has been confirmed
by a company specialist so far.
</P>
<P>
   Of the first eight workers diagnosed, Woodhouse said, six have
returned to work. Worldwide, the company has about 1,000 employees,
with about 175 of them at the Pawtucket plant. Woodhouse said
Microfibres has spent $1.5 million at the plant to investigate and
improve conditions as recommended by federal regulators, plus more
than another $3.5 million at its four other plants around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   The work-related disease, first described as ``flock worker's
lung'' by federal health officials last year, results from
pulmonary inflammation that can lead to permanent scarring. Severe
coughing and difficulty in breathing are symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   The best treatment is for the worker to get out of the
manufacturing environment linked to the disease, researchers say,
although medications can also treat the symptoms. Researchers are
not sure what in the manufacturing process causes the disease.
Flocked fabric, a velvety material used in upholstery and toys, is
made from tiny nylon fibers applied to an adhesive-coated backing.

   I had an unusual interview the other day. It was with Dejair
Birschner, the 48-year-old mayor of Una, a town of 32,000
inhabitants on the edge of Brazil's Atlantic rain forest. The
mayor, along with a team of conservationists, took me on a tour of
the rain forest eco-park near Una that is supposed to provide jobs
so his people won't strip the forest bare and destroy one of the
world's great ecosystems.
</P>
<P>
   Birschner says he understands that logging is not sustainable
anymore. He knows the environmentalists have a point. But he also
knows that his town really isn't prepared for life without logging.
After our interview, the mayor startled me by saying: ``Now, I want
to ask you something. Do we have any future?''
</P>
<P>
   It was a powerful question. I ad-libbed something about the need
to move from an agro-economy to a more knowledge-based economy, by
better educating his town's children. The mayor listened, thanked
me and left. I asked our translator to ask him privately what he
thought of my answer. The translator reported back that the mayor
wanted me to know that when he gets to the office every morning he
has 200 people waiting for him, asking for jobs and food _ plus
out-of-work loggers threatening his life. If he can't provide them
jobs, they will cut the trees and sell them to buy food _ whether
it's good for the rain forest or not.
</P>
<P>
   Birschner represents a whole generation of people around the
world today who are trapped in a no man's land, between the
computer generation that their kids, if they're lucky, might get up
to speed for and their parents' generation that enjoyed a stable
existence from logging and farming. I knew what he was saying in
his question: ``My villagers can't live off the forest anymore, and
we're not equipped to live off computers. What are we supposed to
do?''
</P>
<P>
   High-tech entrepreneurs like to compare today's
super-competitive economy to the old story about the lion and the
gazelle in the jungle: Every night the lion goes to sleep knowing
that in the morning, when the sun comes up, if it can't outrun the
slowest gazelle, the lion will go hungry. Every night the gazelle
goes to sleep knowing that when the sun comes up, if it can't
outrun the fastest lion, it's dead meat. But the one thing they
both know is that in the morning, they better start running.
</P>
<P>
   Well, not everyone is equipped to run so fast. There are a lot
of turtles out there trying to avoid becoming roadkill on the
information highway. They are the villagers in Una, the pensioners
in Russia, the unemployed in China, Indonesia, South Korea and
Thailand. The turtles represent the real threat to the stability of
this whole movement toward high-tech, free-market, global
capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have been wondering for a while now whether those left
behind by globalization will develop an alternative ideology to
liberal, free-market capitalism. In the first era of globalization,
before World War I, when faced with the brutality of global
capitalism, people thought that communism, socialism and central
planning were the answer. But those ideas are now bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
   I don't think there will be an alternative ideology this time
around. There are none. The turtles who can't keep up will just eat
the rain forest _ each in his own way, without trying to explain it
or justify it. That is, if governments don't develop safety nets
for the left-behinds, to protect them from hitting bottom and to
help lift them into the game, they will make their own safety nets.
</P>
<P>
   In Brazil, they will log the rest of the rain forest or they
will join the peasant movement in the Brazilian countryside called
Sem-Teto _ those without roofs _ who simply steal what they need.
In Indonesia, they will eat the Chinese merchants, by ransacking
their stores. In Russia, they will sell weapons to Iran or turn to
crime.
</P>
<P>
   This is not what the turtles want. There was a big street
protest in Rio two weeks ago against the privatization of the state
telephone company, Telebras. The Brazilian newspaper O Globo asked
one of the demonstrators why he had come, and he said: ``They told
me if I came I might get a job.'' The poor guy wasn't against the
privatization. He just wanted a share.
</P>
<P>
   With all due respect to 1960s revolutionary ideology, the
wretched of the earth want to go to Disney World, not to the
barricades _ if they're given half a chance. If not, they will eat
their rain forest, whatever it might be.

REVOLUTION SUBDUE MUTINY IN SHOOTOUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA _ The Revolution still have the worst record in Major
League Soccer. But they remain in playoff contention after holding
the Tampa Bay Mutiny to a 1-1 tie, then taking the post-match
shootout Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The point the Revolution earned gives them 20 points in 25
games, still 1 behind the Mutiny in the race for the final Eastern
Conference playoff berth.
</P>
<P>
   And the Revolution's fortunes received a further boost with the
return of Jair, their most promising midfielder in the early part
of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Jair had been listed ``out for the season'' by MLS after
breaking his left ankle May 16. But he resumed training last month,
hoping to return to action by the Aug. 22 match against Los Angeles
at Foxboro Stadium. He entered the lineup a week early, replacing
Johnny Torres at the start of the second half and immediately
changing the dynamic of the Revolution offense.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution attack became less predictable. And though he
appeared to tire late in the second half, Jair was able to maintain
possession and put teammates in threatening positions.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Revolution took a first-half lead on an Ivan McKinley
goal, they seldom seemed capable of putting the game away. But they
were resourceful enough to remain in playoff contention, thanks to
some spectacular goalkeeping by Ian Feuer and McKinley's clinching
shootout goal.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution lost Oscar Pareja (hamstring) in the fifth minute
and failed to mount a cohesive attack in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay's offense went through midfield and produced effective
buildups, especially through Mauricio Ramos and Paul Dougherty in
the middle and Frankie Hejduk on the right. But Feuer blocked
everything until the final minutes of the half.
</P>
<P>
   Feuer's first save stopped Steve Ralston from the goal area
after McKinley failed to clear a Hejduk cross in the ninth minute.
</P>
<P>
   A Hejduk run followed by a Roy Wegerle backheel set up Dougherty
to go in alone on Feuer five minutes later. Feuer made his most
spectacular stop on Alan Prampin, who flicked a Hejduk pass on the
edge of the goal area and drilled a scissors kick in the 34th
minute.
</P>
<P>
   The best Revolution attempts were speculative long-range drives
by defenders Edwin Gorter and Manny Motajo. David Nakhid replaced
Pareja, changing from his accustomed role as a defensive midfielder
to an attacking midfielder. The Revolution had difficulty adjusting
to the change but eventually threatened late in the half.
</P>
<P>
   Referee Marcel Yonan whistled a foul instead of allowing play to
continue with Imad Baba in possession 40 yards from the goal. But
the Revolution capitalized as Gorter curled a free kick into the
middle of the penalty area. Raul Diaz Arce's header was punched out
by Thomas Ravelli, but McKinley followed for a 1-0 lead in the 38th
minute.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, Ralston slid through the Revolution defense on
the edge of the penalty area, but Feuer pushed aside his low shot.
But in the 44th minute, Motajo flicked away a corner directly to
Wegerle, who quickly centered to Ralston, who headed in to tie the
score.
</P>
<P>
   Jair made his first appearance since May 16 at the start of the
second half and quickly changed the dynamics of the Revolution
attack.
</P>
<P>
   Jair brought some sensibility to midfield and displayed enough
strength and savvy to hold off defenders. He faked Dougherty to
open space, then split the defense with a 60-yard lead pass to Imad
Baba. Joe-Max Moore and Diaz Arce followed the play, and Diaz Arce
had a clear shot saved by Ravelli.
</P>
<P>
   Midway through the half, Jair dribbled through two defenders in
the Revolution end, then set up Nakhid for a 25-yard drive which
was saved by Ravelli.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa had a clear chance to gain the lead, but substitute Paul
Young's rebound was high after Feuer halted Dougherty.

 &UR; HEALTH _  &LR; Larry Adelman, who operates a seven-person documentary
film company in San Francisco, was so upset by the latest statement
from the firm's health care provider that he had to sit down. The
provider had just notified him of a hefty 23 percent increase next
year. ``I was outraged,'' said Adelman. ``They couldn't give us any
explanation.'' Small companies like Adelman's aren't the only ones
grappling with climbing health insurance rates this year, but they
face steeper increases than larger firms. And they're left with the
tough choice of either cutting employee benefits or watching
monthly expenses soar. BY AMY DOAN

FROM A VOICE OF EXPERIENCE, A WARNING OF MORE TO COME  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 16) 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Please note subslug)  
 (af)  
 By EDWARD WYATT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As manager of the Vanguard Windsor fund for more than 30 years,
John Neff accumulated one of most admirable investment records in
the mutual fund industry. He did not follow the crowd, but sought
opportunities in places where other portfolio managers failed to
look.
</P>
<P>
   While his contrarian nature sometimes caused him to be early in
expecting market downturns, it left him in a good position to
benefit from the inevitable rebounds. His long experience through
up-and-down markets makes him an excellent source for perspective
on the current volatility.
</P>
<P>
   Though he is officially retired, Neff, who is 66, still helps
manage money for colleges and foundations.
</P>
<P>
   The recent downturn has not been a surprise to him; he expects
the correction to exceed the level of 10 percent reached on
Friday. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics) Does a period of volatility worry you, or do you
see it as offering opportunity?(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, it seems to me that this market has been sharply
overvalued. I welcome the correction because it means that you
don't have to take a more substantial correction later on that
would potentially set off other things in the economy, like people
spending less because they suffered so dramatically in the market.
</P>
<P>
   I've been saying for a while that we should be seeing a 20 to 30
percent correction. So we've got a further distance to go. That
would bring it down to a more reasonable level and remind people
that they shouldn't think that stocks are going to go up 18 percent
a year into perpetuity. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)In managing a portfolio in a period like this, do
you have a list of stocks that you want to buy, or do you try to
move some money into safer havens in bonds or some other asset
class?(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, before I recently went on a week-and-a-half golf cruise
around Ireland and Scotland, I peeled off part of my personal
portfolio. And now I'm thinking about putting some of that back in,
particularly in some areas that have gotten baked pretty badly:
basic commodity cyclicals, maybe steels and commodity chemicals. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)It seems that when you were managing the Windsor
fund you frequently had some money on the sidelines either parked
in bonds or in cash.(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. 1987 was the best case. We had about 20 percent in cash. The
thought was the shareholder had given us money to be invested in
equities, but when you couldn't find sensible things to buy, we
told the shareholder that at the margin we could go as high as 20
percent in cash. We wouldn't do more than that because, one, we
could be wrong and, two, we'd been given the money to invest in
equities. But we did that about three or four times and
successfully each time. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Now the conventional wisdom is that individuals
should stay fully invested and not try to time the market. Does
that make sense to you?(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I think you can do something at the margin when the market
gets as crazy and overvalued as it's been recently. One of the five
myths out there is, ``Thou shalt not market-time.'' Well, you know
when that gets into the conventional wisdom and consensus, it's
time to question it. And you know there have been times in the
postwar period _ 1974 and 1987 particularly _ when it made some
sense to take your foot off the accelerator. When you do it, then
you're beholden to put the money back in when you get the
opportunity. &QL;
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)What are the five myths you mentioned?(end italics0 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Thou shalt not market-time. Inflation is dead. The cult of
common stock says cash flow burgeons into perpetuity. Bond rates
are going down. And the final one: Earnings continue to move up
noticeably. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Earnings is one that a lot of people are focused on
now.(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Particularly in that valuations have gotten high and we run
on earnings trust. You've never had anything short of 1929 that was
this high, so you're looking for some better earnings gains to
justify these prices. Here we are 23{ times earnings. I think
earnings will be up 2 percent this year, and I'd guess 2 percent
next year. That's not exactly the kind of trust that you'd
ordinarily like when you pay this kind of heavy multiple. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Are the things that are causing earnings problems
for some companies now deep-seated problems, or are they more of a
transient nature?(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. When you get to these frenzied markets, it drives managements
or portions of managements to hanky-panky. Cendant and Sunbeam have
already announced accounting irregularities. I don't know about
Oxford Health, but certainly they didn't know where they were in
pricing and expenses to their clients at all. When you push too
hard and strain, you create the circumstance under which it becomes
more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, the 2 percent increase in corporate earnings that I
expect both this year and next year is simply the pressures of a
slower economy, increased wage rates and the difficulty in passing
those costs along in a very competitive environment. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Do you worry about or look at anything other than
earnings? Does the situation in Asia or how currencies are valued
or the uncertainty in Washington give you pause?(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, certainly that overlay is taken into consideration by
the earnings numbers. That brings me back to the myths that
inflation is dead and bond rates are going to go down. I'd say
already we've set into motion the forces that are going to push the
CPI up to 2{, 3 percent and we'll be looking at that kind of
annualized rate as we get into the end of the year. And if that's
right, bond rates will be moving up instead of down. I'd have them
up maybe 75 basis points, to 6{ percent or so on long governments,
from 5.7 percent or so now. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Sounds bleak. In 1988, after the big decline in '87,
you said that the average guy in Peoria and Oshkosh really didn't
care about the stock market as long as he kept working. Aren't
things are a little different now, given the popularity of 401(k)
programs?(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   A. One of my other myths is that cash flow is guaranteed into
perpetuity. Obviously I'm resorting to hyperbole, but you know the
mutual fund investor can be and has been fickle. If the market got
too high and then the subsequent correction was too dramatic, you
would lay waste to all those dollar-averaging programs that seek to
buy on the downturn. That's what I've been concerned about, and I
thought it could eventually have an impact on consumer
expenditures.
</P>
<P>
   But I don't think the size correction that I'm talking about
particularly will do that, in that we've already experienced some
of it. It's going to become more of a thinking man's market. Of
course, you do get negative earnings surprises and attendant 15,
20, 25 percent corrections on those stocks in one day.
</P>
<P>
   But on the other hand, the companies that measure up won't go
down as much or won't go down maybe at all. Or they might even go
up even within a marketplace that could slide another 10 or 15
percent. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)You mentioned a couple of things that might look
good to you now, like some of the commodity cyclicals. But if you
think that earnings growth is slowing down, is that a good time to
buy those stocks?(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, first, they didn't go up, to speak of, except briefly,
and they've been really slammed lately because of the Asian
overlay. An awful lot of their products _ steel, chemical, paper,
aluminum _ are influenced by the consumption numbers going down in
those countries. I'd look for them to stabilize and come back.

 GERMAN INDUSTRIAL GIANT STARTS SILICON VALLEY VENTURE FUND 
</HEADLINE>
 CHRON - DIGITAL 15   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
One of Germany's technology giants has dipped its toe into the
Silicon Valley venture pool by opening a $300 million fund to
invest in networking and telecommunications startups.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Siemens AG is a $70 billion industrial Frankenstein that grafts
together 16 different divisions, including electric power
generation, chipmaking, computing and telephone equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Given its size and complexity, Siemens isn't noted for speed,
which is a liability in the fast-moving telecom equipment business,
where it competes with U.S. firms like Lucent and Cisco Systems.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Siemens executive Anthony Maher said the company
chose Mustang Fund as the name of its new venture arm, which will
be headquartered in Santa Clara.
</P>
<P>
   ``A mustang is something that moves fast and has the image of
being free-wheeling,'' said Maher, who introduced the new fund to
local VCs at a Thursday night dinner in Palo Alto.
</P>
<P>
   Only time will tell whether the fund will fit the name. Siemens
will target startups in three telecom-related areas: technologies
that carry voice and data over the same lines, equipment to create
broadband or wireless networks and software to help manage such
networks.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Peter Morris, telecom partner at New Enterprise Associates,
said that in addition to cash, Siemens could offer startups access
to markets in Europe and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Telecom startup investments is an area where Cisco has had an
effective monopoly,'' he said. ``Siemens is going to challenge
that.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to its venture fund, Maher said Seimens will also be
looking to acquire full-grown telecom players.
</P>
<P>
   With an eye toward merger possibilities, investment bankers
George Boutros and Bill Brady of Credit Suisse First Boston hosted
Thursday's dinner, which introduced the fund's manager, Bjoern Eske
Christensen, to local VCs.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Speaking of giants: &LR;  Three years ago, IBM seemed like a
wounded beast. Not any more. In everything from semiconductor and
disk-drive manufacturing to mainframe computing and enterprise
software, Big Blue is showing newfound strength.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the tech world's 800-pound gorilla made a subtle but
strategic move to enhance its role as a driving force on the
Internet, by luring Mike Nelson to IBM's Internet division.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson has been the Internet lobe of Al Gore's brain since 1988,
when he joined the staff of the then-junior senator from Tennessee.
Stephen Wolff, former director of the National Science Foundation
network, ancestor of today's Internet, recalled working with Nelson
and Gore on the legislation that created five national
supercomputing centers and a network that linked them. That
eventually led to the current Net boom.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson ``is an extremely bright guy,'' said Wolff, who joined
Cisco in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson, who followed Gore to the White House and later worked at
the Federal Communications Commission before joining IBM, said his
new job would let him continue stitching together the Internet. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``IBM has a global reach, it's involved in hardware, software,
services,'' Nelson said.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson will continue to work in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Well-spoken: &LR;  Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa (D-Los
Angeles) visited National Semiconductor headquarters in Sunnyvale
Thursday for a public policy roundtable sponsored by the American
Electronics Association.
</P>
<P>
   As might be expected, industry reps wanted to prod the speaker
to work for tax breaks and deregulation. But the dominant issue
around the table was the need for educational reform _ and how to
pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   Villaraigosa also lobbied the tech execs to support a $9 billion
educational bond measure that he has gotten through the Assembly,
but it has been stalled by Democrats in the state Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Reminding high-tech execs that brainpower will drive the New
Economy, he urged them to use their clout in Sacramento to break
the school-bond &UR;  &LR; logjam.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Something new? &LR;  Like any bride on her wedding eve, Bonnie
Lombardi was frantically checking items off her to-do list
yesterday: flowers, caterer, wedding dress, teleconferencing gear.
</P>
<P>
   Teleconferencing gear? Yes, it seems that Lombardi's father and
niece weren't able to fly out from Baltimore to witness the
ceremony, which should be held this afternoon (providing Joel
Harrison says ``I do.'').
</P>
<P>
   To set up her teleconference, Lombardi will use a camcorder that
plugs into a $100 video capture card in a PC. A 33.6 kilobaud modem
will pump the video stream over the Internet to Baltimore, where
the bride's father, George Gwin, will walk down the virtual aisle,
via the image on a Sony laptop.
</P>
<P>
   And who thought up the idea, but Lombardi's brother-in-law, Umar
Hameed.
</P>
<P>
   Hameed, who is sales and marketing manager for Aims Lab in
Fremont _ maker of the aforementioned video card _ said the
tele-wedding was not a publicity grab but a demonstration of how
technology can bring families together.
</P>
<P>
   Of course. And speaking for the relatives in Baltimore, let me
just say that the wedding gifts are in the e-mail.

SMALL FIRMS FEEL SQUEEZED BY ESCALATING MANAGED-CARE
PROVIDER  RATES 
 &HT;     BY AMY DOAN 
</HEADLINE>
 CHRON - HEALTH   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Larry Adelman, who operates a seven-person documentary film company
in San Francisco, was so upset by the latest statement from the
firm's health care provider that he had to sit down.
<P>
   The provider had just notified him of a hefty 23 percent
increase next year. ``I was outraged,'' said Adelman. ``They
couldn't give us any explanation.''
</P>
<P>
   Small companies like Adelman's aren't the only ones grappling
with climbing health insurance rates this year, but they face
steeper increases than larger firms. And they're left with the
tough choice of either cutting employee benefits or watching
monthly expenses soar.
</P>
<P>
   They also realize they have to pay the higher rates or risk
losing employees to firms that do offer such coverage.
</P>
<P>
   If Adelman's company, California Newsreel, sticks with its
current provider, the total monthly premium for the four employees
covered by the company plan will jump from $1,463 to $1,804 for
full coverage. California Newsreel pays 100 percent of the premiums
and Adelman says he won't shift the burden onto his employees.
</P>
<P>
   Many managed health care plans have kept premiums relatively
stable for the past few years, but they have been raising rates
recently to cover costs ranging from higher administrative expenses
to the price of trendy prescription drugs like Claritan and Viagra.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, companies are bracing for 6 percent
increases next year compared to 3 percent increases over the past
few years, according to a 1998 study by KPMG Peat Marwick.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is tougher for small businesses because they face
rates that are about 30 percent higher than what large companies
pay for equivalent plans, according to the National Federation of
Independent Businesses, a Washington, D.C., advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   According to a recent federation survey, rising health costs is
the single biggest worry for business owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen increases before, but this is ridiculous. We're
running out of options,'' said Adelman, who has been running his
company since 1976.
</P>
<P>
   His health insurance provider, Anthem Health Care &AMP; Life
Insurance Co. in Piscataway, N.J., attributed the rise in
California Newsreel's rates to health care industry trends, but
acknowledged that small companies sometimes pay more than large
companies for identical coverage.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for this disparity is that insurance agents receive
higher commissions for small company accounts than they do for
large company accounts, said Rich Phillips, a vice president and
actuary with Anthem.
</P>
<P>
   It's not unusual to see commissions of 8 to 10 percent for work
with smaller operations compared to 3 percent for large companies,
he said. The higher commissions reflect the fact small companies
bring in less revenues than larger firms.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; John Bertko, a principal with Reden &AMP; Anders, an actuarial
analysis and health care consulting company in Berkeley, says
providers also charge small companies higher premiums because they
represent a statistically bigger risk.
</P>
<P>
   That's because many small or sole proprietor businesses,
especially those with younger employees, choose not to get any
health coverage. More than 30 percent of ``young companies'' don't
buy insurance, Bertko noted.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, small businesses that buy health insurance wind up
paying more because the pool of insured tilts toward older
employees who are more likely to have expensive illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for the higher rates is that while large firms
have enough employees to insulate themselves from ``rate spikes,''
small companies can experience a jolt in rates when a single
employee has a high claim.
</P>
<P>
   Health insurers also say small companies are less predictable
due to the small number of employees covered and the fact that they
tend to have high job turnover.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because they're less easy to predict than a large company with
many employees, providers are going to err on the side of
conservativism because they need to protect themselves against
worst-case scenarios,'' said Anthem's Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, small-business owners say the situation is
unfair because they don't have the power to negotiate with
providers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When rates go up, it's small companies that get squeezed the
most because we have less clout,'' said Adelman.
</P>
<P>
   Gwen Kaplan, owner of Ace Mailing, a 30-person company in San
Francisco, agrees. Kaplan, whose company uses Kaiser's medical
plan, said she just agreed to a 9 percent increase and has been
told to expect at least an 11 percent increase on top of that next
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tremendous concern _ I don't know if we can afford
it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan said that unlike large companies, which are ``courted''
by providers, her company has to ``sign whatever is put in front of
us.''
</P>
<P>
   She pointed to the recent negotiations between Oakland-based
Kaiser and the California Public Employees Retirement System, one
of the biggest health-care purchasers in the country.
</P>
<P>
   CalPERS in June agreed to a 10.75 percent increase in its Kaiser
premiums for next year compared to the 12 percent Kaiser had
initially asked for.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were able to throw their weight around in a way we just
can't,'' said Kaplan.
</P>
<P>
   A Kaiser executive said that the 1.25 percent reduction did not
result from negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took another look at their senior population and found that
more of them could go into our Senior Advantage program, which
dropped the costs a bit,'' said Dean Kemp, who manages Kaiser's
plans with small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea that we charge small companies higher rates because
they can't negotiate is just wrong,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many small-business advocates maintain that the only way
they can get better rates is to pool together to increase their
purchasing power.
</P>
<P>
   A bill strongly backed &UR;  &LR; by House Republicans would allow small
businesses to join forces across the country to purchase health
care. Right now, businesses can pool together only within their
state.
</P>
<P>
   The Hastert Bill, named after Illinois Representative Dennis
Hastert, would let small businesses form ``Association Health
Plans,'' or ``health marts,'' as they're nicknamed. The bill, which
has cleared the House, is now awaiting a vote in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The plans might decrease rates for some businesses, because they
would effectively make the the risk pool _ the number of workers
that insurance companies base their expected expenses on _ bigger
and more predictable.
</P>
<P>
   Small companies could then spread the risk of illness and injury
across many workers and regions, just like large employers do.
</P>
<P>
   But detractors say it will simply force companies with low
health care expenditures to subsidize companies with higher costs.
</P>
<P>
   Others fear that a provision in the bill that eliminates the
need for state-by-state regulation will open the door for
underfunded, unreliable providers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might help, but I'd be cautious about it, because it would
be hard for a few people in Washington to oversee all of these
companies, so you could have companies signing a bunch of
businesses onto their health plan and going belly-up,'' said
Borland.
</P>
<P>
   Another critic says the bill doesn't go far enough. ``What's
needed is a way for small companies to pool together with large
companies in their region _ then you'd get equitable rates,'' said
Wanda Jones, president of New Century Healthcare Institute in San
Francisco.

ON THE EAST SIDE, A MARKET BLOWOUT IS JUST A BREEZE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 16) 
</HEADLINE>
   (Ed: Please note subslug)  
 (af)  
 By JENNIFER STEINHAUER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There are many prisms through which to view the state
of the economy. Stock prices are the current fixation, of course.
But there are also consumer confidence figures, the long bond
perhaps. And then there is dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Sirio Maccioni, owner of Le Cirque 2000 on Manhattan's Upper
East Side, said he sold more filets of halibut, chocolate souffles
and creme brulees last week than he has in many, many months. At
neighboring Daniel, this summer has been the season of the $5,000
bottle of wine. Elaine's, the famous local watering hole, has been
selling filet mignon and martinis smartly every night.
</P>
<P>
   Correction? Up here, that could mean: ``Please recheck my bill.
You forgot to add my goat cheese tart.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I have the impression when the market is bad people
just want to eat more,'' Maccioni said. ``In the last couple of
days, I have been really focusing on this issue, and I have to tell
you that I have seen more people drinking and eating than ever
before. Maybe they just want to be good sports.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, market experts would say, they've lost their minds. Gurus
and analysts aplenty contend that something has changed. That
reality is finally throwing its wet blanket onto a market long
fueled by euphoria. That with the Dow Jones industrial average down
9.8 percent from its peak just a month ago, the good times are
over.
</P>
<P>
   But on the Upper East Side _ where people think nothing of doing
their entire grocery shopping at the gourmet market on the corner,
where 28-year-old market mavens call nine-room apartments with
walk-in humidors their bachelor pads, where the goings-on along
Wall Street are watched with the same intense interest usually
reserved for one's loved ones _ sentiment remained strong last week
that the good times are now.
</P>
<P>
   ``You still see all the signs of a bull market on the Upper East
Side,'' said Nicole Gresham Perry, a stockbroker who lives in the
East 80s with her husband, George Perry, a specialist in commercial
real estate deals. ``You still need a reservation to get in the
local hamburger joint, and the limos from Wall Street are lined up
outside it every night.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that people aren't watching the market's movements closely.
Some of the selling that has knocked stocks off their heights
emanated from this neighborhood, as profits were converted into
real estate holdings or, more often, plain green cash.
</P>
<P>
   But the much-talked-about wealth effect _ the translation of
money made on paper to money spent on stuff _ appears to be on an
almost giddy high, as if New York's aristocrats subconsciously
believe that spending in and of itself can help prevent a further,
and more serious, market correction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even as the market dived, the business here has been
phenomenal,'' said Christopher Dziadosz, manager of Eagles Antiques
on Madison Avenue at 83rd Street, as he leaned back into a wildly
expensive leather chair. It thrilled him, certainly, to sell dozens
of antique end tables and imported decorative pillows in the dead
of summer. But he acknowledged that he was also somewhat
frightened.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never see this kind of money coming in this time of year,''
Dziadosz said. ``I'm perplexed. If people are skittish, why are
they throwing hundreds of thousands of dollars at me?''
</P>
<P>
   Economists warn that the stalling of the bull market cannot help
but take a toll, eventually, on consumer spending. Indeed, with
more people than ever owning stocks, many experts say a big drop
would hurt the economy more now than in the past. And if so, New
York's economy _ in which Wall Street has become the biggest force
_ will feel the pain.
</P>
<P>
   Merchants certainly recognize the connection. ``People have to
(italics)feel(end italics) rich,'' said Dziadosz, who recently sold
a $45,000 English table the day it arrived in his store _ about
three months and a day faster than he had expected. ``There is an
emotional tie. Sometimes a person isn't feeling great one day and
they decide not to redecorate their apartment, and then their
daughter marries a nice guy and suddenly they feel happy and come
in and buy, buy, buy.''
</P>
<P>
   Remember the 1920s, when everyone was partying before the
infamous fall? Or what about all those ill-timed real estate
purchases in early 1987? If people uptown are reflecting on the
past, it does not seem to scare them. In any event, stocks have not
yet fallen enough for average Americans, let alone the East Side's
upper crust, to be panicking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nineteen eighty-seven was a real eye-opener to people,'' said
James Glassman, senior United States economist at Chase Manhattan
Bank. ``They learned that the market can have very sharp drops but
recover so dramatically that the average investor now views a
market drop as a buying opportunity. I think it will take a lot, a
very large correction, to really shake people up.''
</P>
<P>
   Of dozens of people working or living on the Upper East Side who
were interviewed last week, most said they were leaving their money
just where it was _ or even picking up some beaten-down stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I am doing is staying put,'' said Diane Terman
Felenstein, a public relations executive who also runs a women's
investment club. ``I sold after the '87 crash. Then I wept. All
those companies came back. So now I am in for the long haul.''
</P>
<P>
   Laurence Leeds, who manages money at Buckingham Research Group
and lives on Fifth Avenue, shares his neighbors' views. ``This is
no time for panic,'' he said. ``Most people have gotten some cash
or bought some bonds, but I don't think anyone is running out of
the market. They are going to reinvest at a lower price.'' He is
giving similar advice to his clients.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Still others say they have no reason to worry about the market's
volatility. ``Business is wonderful,'' said Selda Chender, an
interior designer. As for stocks, Ms. Chender said she avoids all
equities. ``I lost too much money,'' she said. In 1987? ``No,
dear,'' she replied. ``In 1974.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Elliot, who owns women's and men's clothing stores bearing
his name on Madison Avenue, said he could judge what was happening
in the economy by which store had better sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``A woman shops when she's happy, she shops when she's sad, she
shops when she's mad, she shops when she's glad,'' said Elliot,
holding court from a wooden chair in his women's store. ``When men
are sad, they drink themselves into a stupor. That is probably why
the men's business over the last week and a half dropped
dramatically and the women's business has been phenomenal.''
</P>
<P>
   For those who have lived through decades of bull and bear
markets, a swift and sharp correction off a giant base can seem
almost inconsequential. ``You have to be practical and believe in
capitalism,'' said Arthur E. Crumlish, a salesman for a high-end
printing concern who lives off Park Avenue with his wife,
Gabrielle, a schoolteacher.
</P>
<P>
   Crumlish, 60, said he learned long ago not to liquidate stocks
in a panic, not to spend all his investment profits, and to believe
that a bear market is like an unwelcome guest who will ultimately
agree to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to try and hope you're in a situation where you're
assured of a basic existence,'' he said. ``I always wanted to be so
successful that you'd have to call me at the beach right now. But
the important thing is that we've raised the kids and sent them all
to college. I feel optimistic about the future.''
</P>
<P>
   You have to call the beach to reach plenty of other East Siders
this time of year. ``People are definitely taking money out of the
market and are buying houses out here,'' said Andrea Ackerman,
managing partner of the Southampton office of Dunemere Associates
Real Estate, which serves a large Upper East Side clientele.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ackerman said her record-breaking summer included sales in
East Hampton of a small cottage for $5 million and a luxury home
for $12.5 million _ neither of them on the water.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not the kind of negotiating on the asking price that
there used to be,'' she said. ``Chances are if someone comes down
10 percent, that is about it.''
</P>
<P>
   In Manhattan, the story is much the same. ``Over the last year,
a lot of people have taken money out of the market and bought their
dream house,'' said Barbara Corcoran, chairwoman of Corcoran Group,
the broker for 40 percent of the Upper East Side's luxury
apartments. ``Earlier, the market was our foe, because people were
making so much money they felt it would be too expensive to get
out,'' because they would miss out on further gains.
</P>
<P>
   Are people the slightest bit nervous? ``I am finding that our
clients are talking concerned but not acting concerned,'' Ms.
Corcoran said.
</P>
<P>
   What gives economists, retailers, manufacturers and other
participants in the American economy the jitters, of course, is the
prospect that the affluent may start to act on their concerns. And
at least some have.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've already reined in spending,'' said Ann Rapp, an art
dealer who was out shopping along Madison Avenue the other day.
``In the last few months, I've been cutting back on restaurants _
not that I can't still get a table at Mortimer's _ but I am cutting
back. On clothes too, definitely. You've got to be ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Signs of incipient inflation could send the stock market into a
steep plunge _ and the economy with it. Formal gauges of the cost
of living remain in check. But the Upper East Side has its own
measures, and, again, they involve food.
</P>
<P>
   Cemal Tezean, who has been selling fruit on the corner of Third
Avenue and 84th Street for three years, notes an annoying
connection between market drops and the price of cherries, grapes
and plums. ``Stock market down, fruit prices up!'' he declaimed.
``Last week, I get a box of grapes for $20; this week, same box
$28.'' Shoppers paid $1.25 a bunch, compared with $1 the previous
week. ``Customers complain,'' Tezean, 38, said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are some people on the East Side who don't give the
financial markets the first thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear the bond guys crying,'' said Elaine Kaufman, owner of
Elaine's, the Second Avenue restaurant favored by novelists,
journalists and Woody Allen. ``The writers aren't affected by it;
they go on writing and just don't care. The small business owners
keep going. The computer geniuses don't care. These people are just
going on with their lives.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nothing's more fun than watching a good magician. With a wave of
a wand and some sleight of hand, these conjurers create worlds in
which anything seems possible _ elephants vanish, ladies are sawed
in half and assistants levitate.
</P>
<P>
   But even David Copperfield could learn a trick or two from some
of the true masters of illusion: the financial wizards on Wall
Street and in corporate America. With a wave of a pen and some
sleight of hand, they can transform reality _ bad numbers vanish,
expenses are cut in half and earnings levitate. Shareholders rarely
notice these tricks _ which are perfectly legal _ until some of
their investment disappears.
</P>
<P>
   So today, let's part the curtain a bit, and reveal secrets
behind some of this financial hocus-pocus. One place to start is
the merger deal involving the Ciena Corp., which has attracted
praise for equipment that allows long-distance companies to
increase capacity significantly without new cables.
</P>
<P>
   Since June, Ciena has been rushing toward its merger with
Tellabs Inc., another company in the industry. For strategic
reasons, the deal makes sense: Tellabs needs Ciena's technology,
and Ciena needs Tellabs' customers.
</P>
<P>
   The shareholder meetings to approve this deal are scheduled for
Friday, but last week Ciena tossed out some chilling news for
Tellabs stockholders: Its third-quarter earnings would be far below
analysts' expectations, in part because of a delay in a $25 million
order.
</P>
<P>
   How could this happen so suddenly? The simple answer is, it
didn't. Ciena's earnings have been deteriorating for months. And,
whether by accident or design, somebody has been keeping those
facts up their sleeves.
</P>
<P>
   Like most tricks, this one can be fathomed by following one
simple rule: in this case, keep your eye on the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with what's known as the S-4 registration, which is
issued for use by shareholders in deciding whether to approve a
merger deal. In that document, there are signs that this deal was
being rushed.
</P>
<P>
   For example, take a look at page 18, where some of Ciena's
financial data are reported. The document reports numbers for the
six months that ended on April 30, as well as for the first
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   As if they had disappeared, the second quarter's numbers are not
mentioned. Odd, since the document was filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission well after Ciena reported its second
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't mean the numbers can't be figured out. By
subtracting the first quarter from the six-month total, a problem
comes up. The numbers indicate that Ciena reported a gross profit
of $36.8 million. But in the quarterly filing for that period,
Ciena reported almost $78.9 million in gross profit.
</P>
<P>
   Why the difference, particularly when it works to Ciena's
detriment? ``That's a typo,'' said Patrick H. Nettles, chief
executive of Ciena. ``That's a transcription error in preparing the
document.''
</P>
<P>
   Fair enough, and on Friday Ciena said it was correcting the
error in a new filing, shortly after it was pointed out to the
company. But the error raises a question, particularly about a
crucial deal document that Nettles says was reviewed by ``two audit
firms and a lot of lawyers.'' Was this deal of more than $7 billion
being rushed too fast, resulting in a $42 million typo?
</P>
<P>
   Sounds as if a closer look at the S-4 is in order. On the next
page, the document describes what the financial performance of a
combined Tellabs-Ciena would look like. The results seem just
dandy: Both companies earned 37 cents a share, and they are merging
in a one-for-one stock swap. A result, by this calculation, is that
shareholders would suffer no dilution in earnings per share and
would still enjoy their 37 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Careful, it's a trick. The secret, disclosed in a footnote, is
again that Ciena's second quarter disappeared. In combining the two
companies, which have different fiscal reporting periods, the
financial magicians used the quarter ended on April 3 for Tellabs,
and the quarter ended on Jan. 31 for Ciena.
</P>
<P>
   In those two 90-day periods, which had a bit less than 30 days
in common, both Ciena and Tellabs (italics)did(end italics) earn
their 37 cents.
</P>
<P>
   But compare Tellabs' quarter ending April 3 with Ciena's second
quarter, ending April 30 _ periods with more than 60 days in
common. Suddenly, the combined numbers don't look so good. Tellabs
still has its 37 cents, but Ciena's earnings per share drop to 29
cents, meaning that combining the companies would dilute earnings
for Tellabs holders.
</P>
<P>
   Investors who plow further into the S-4 will eventually find a
disclosure _ in the second-to-last sentence of a long paragraph on
a page of nothing but type _ that the proposed deal would indeed
dilute Tellabs earnings per share for 1998 and 1999. But why
weren't numbers used up front reflecting that?
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ciena said that was a decision by Tellabs. A spokesman for
Tellabs said the earlier numbers were used on the advice of its
accountants. The spokesman added that the numbers provided a direct
comparison between the two companies' first fiscal quarters, even
though the dates were significantly different.
</P>
<P>
   By this point, it sounds as if it's time to take a close look at
Ciena's second quarter, a period of enormous struggle for the
company. Ciena's vulnerability has always been its small customer
base. In the first quarter it at least temporarily lost one of the
biggest, Worldcom Inc.
</P>
<P>
   By the second quarter, negotiations between Tellabs and Ciena
were under way, and on the day Ciena was announcing its earnings,
lawyers for Tellabs were distributing a draft of the merger
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   A deal certainly would not have looked too tasty to Tellabs'
shareholders if Ciena's revenues were falling after the Worldcom
debacle _ and indeed they weren't. The company announced $142.7
million in second-quarter revenue, up from $134.3 million in the
first quarter. Even without Worldcom, the company was bringing in
more money. But earnings fell. (Remember the drop from 37 cents a
share to 29 cents?)
</P>
<P>
   Worse, the financial results should have raised questions about
the quality of those earnings. Accounts receivable _ revenue
counted in reported financials that did not yet translate into cash
in hand _ ballooned to their highest level ever, $132 million. That
translates into receivables being more than 80 days outstanding, up
from the usual range of about 30 to 50 days.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, such an expansion in accounts receivables is a
sign of trouble. Perhaps revenues are being recognized extremely
quickly, robbing the next quarter of profits; payment terms are
being loosened, increasing the risk of future losses, or a single
contract is making up a huge portion of earnings.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Nettles indicated that the third possibility
was the answer. Ciena began shipping a new product in the second
quarter, he said, and one big buyer required a field test before
final acceptance. That test was completed near the end of the
quarter, he said, meaning that the revenue was recognized before
payment had been made.
</P>
<P>
   But that also means Ciena's other sales did worse in the second
quarter than the numbers indicated _ the impact, perhaps, of losing
Worldcom. If that had been mentioned in the S-4, it would have been
a clear sign that without another huge shipment of new equipment,
third-quarter revenue was likely to fall.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies say they are still on course for a merger, but
the marketplace isn't so sure. Since the deal is a one-for-one
stock swap, the share prices for the two companies should be
tracking each other closely _ and indeed they had been.
</P>
<P>
   But _ oops! After Friday's announcement, the price of Ciena
dropped $17.0625, to $54.125, while Tellabs dropped $13.6875, to
$58.125, in NASDAQ trading. That $4 spread means the market is not
so sure the companies can get this deal done.
</P>
<P>
   So, what should investors do? Well, if they think the two
companies can still pull this rabbit out of their hat, they should
sell Tellabs and buy Ciena, locking in $4 of profit. Or, if they
think the deal will fall apart, they should probably just stay
away.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens, one thing's for sure: It's going to be one
heck of a trick.

PRESIDENT TO DISCLOSE FEW DETAILS, SOURCES SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton is prepared to tell a grand jury
Monday that he spent time alone with White House intern Monica S.
Lewinsky, and he is expected to discuss the nature of their
relationship while refusing to provide details to the independent
counsel, sources close to the president said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's testimony may differ from sworn statements he made
Jan. 17 in the Paula Corbin Jones sexual harassment case and from
his finger-wagging public denial of a sexual relationship with
Lewinsky, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
   As anticipation built Friday about the president's grand jury
appearance, speculation was rampant around Washington that Clinton
was going to change his story and testify that he had had an
intimate relationship with Lewinsky. White House spokesman Michael
D. McCurry refused to confirm any of it. ``All this is guesswork,''
he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   McCurry did confirm that Clinton will testify at 1 p.m. Monday
in the historic White House Map Room, where Franklin Roosevelt
followed World War II.
</P>
<P>
   His testimony, expected to be completed in a day, will be
broadcast live to the grand jury at US District Courthouse about a
mile from the White House, via a one-way video feed. It will not be
made public.
</P>
<P>
   McCurry said he was uncertain how long the testimony would last,
but he guessed it would be several hours. He said it was unclear if
Clinton would make any public statement about his testimony before
heading off to Martha's Vineyard late Monday night or early Tuesday
for a planned two-week vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the president's advisers, both within and outside the
White House, have urged Clinton to come forward and speak to the
American people before his testimony is leaked to the news media
and interpreted by his critics.
</P>
<P>
   Only a handful of private lawyers and the first lady, who are
protected by legal privileges, are privy to the details of
Clinton's story and his decisions on what to say. His political
advisers have been trying to assess the consequences of the
unprecedented appearance on his presidency without full knowledge
of the facts.
</P>
<P>
   Some of them, nonetheless, have reportedly urged Clinton to
acknowledge some type of relationship with Lewinsky, even if it was
a sexual relationship. As that argument goes, Clinton would not
necessarily be contradicting his deposition in the Jones case
because the definition of sexual relations approved by US District
Judge Susan Webber Wright would be different from what may have
occurred between him and Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Lewinsky, 25, reportedly testified to numerous sexual
encounters with Clinton in the White House over an 18-month period.
She said she did not believe he encouraged her to lie under oath,
though they explored ways to keep the relationship a secret. She
has turned over a navy blue dress thought to contain genetic
material that may match Clinton's DNA. The dress has been sent to
an FBI lab for testing.
</P>
<P>
   Sources close to Clinton said he wants to avoid providing
details that may appeal to more purient interests, and that he
feels may not be relevant to the perjury and obstruction of justice
aspects of the probe.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, those sources said, his lawyers may object to
certain questions during the grand jury testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Under special arrangements made with independent counsel Kenneth
W. Starr's office, Clinton will be accompanied by his attorneys for
his testimony, unlike other witnesses who go before grand juries.
The president's two private lawyers, David E. Kendall and his
partner, Nicole K. Seligman, will be present.
</P>
<P>
   White House General Counsel Charles F. Ruff, who has sat in when
Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton previously have given testimony
to Starr, also will be there. The testimony will be videotaped by
the White House Communications Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Clinton would answer all the questions, McCurry said,
``I don't know why he wouldn't. He's under oath. The truth is the
truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got to testify, and it's a consequential thing when you
go before a grand jury. But we don't know what is going to be
asked. We obviously don't know what's going to be answered,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   McCurry joked about the rampant speculation about what Clinton
will say to the grand jury. ``It's kind of like going into Super
Bowl weekend,'' he told reporters. ``You read every coach's or
ex-coach's idea of what the winn

U.S. HALTS BUSINESS AT EMBASSY IN ALBANIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also KENYA-BOMBING) 
(js) 
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The State Department said Friday that it had shut
down routine operations at the U.S. Embassy in Albania because of
``recent declarations by Islamic extremists against the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   The department ordered some embassy employees to leave Albania
and warned Americans not to travel there. The announcement came a
week after bomb attacks on the U.S. embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials say that one of the questions
the investigators are asking is whether the bombings might have
been a response to the arrest in June of three Muslim
fundamentalists by Albanian authorities. The three later were
deported to Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   The deportations prompted a terrorist group in Cairo, Egypt,
Islamic Jihad, to issue a threat this month to attack U.S. targets
abroad. Administration officials acknowledge that the CIA worked
with the Albanian police to plan the raid that resulted in the
capture of the militants.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is going to East Africa on
Sunday to meet with investigators and to console embassy employees.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon announced Friday that three of those killed in
Nairobi would be granted waivers to be buried at Arlington National
Cemetery. They are Julian Bartley Sr., the counsul general, his
20-year-old son, Jay Bartley, and Prabhi Guptara Kavaler, an
administrative officer in the embassy.
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Department said Friday that it would substantially
reduce U.S. participation in NATO exercises scheduled to be held in
Albania beginning Monday. The Pentagon insisted that there was no
connection between its move and the threats from Islamic
extremists.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to curtail embassy operations in Tirana, the
Albanian capital, was made as reports circulated that Albania had
arrested another Egyptian Muslim militant on Thursday and was
prepared to deport him to Egypt, where he could face execution.
</P>
<P>
   The arrest was reported by an Islamic group in London, the
Islamic Observation Center, which protested the Albanian move and
called for human rights groups to block the extradition.
</P>
<P>
   The Islamic Jihad is among the terrorist groups that are
suspects in the bombings in Kenya and Tanzania, which killed more
than 250 people.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The group has close ties to Osama bin Laden, an anti-American
Saudi expatriate who is also described by administration officials
as a suspect in the attacks in East Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of recent declarations by Islamic extremists against
the United States and its citizens, and because of the possibility
that the U.S. embassy facilities in Tirana, Albania, could be among
the targets of a terrorist attack, the Department of State has
ordered the departure of embassy personnel in non-emergency
positions and families of embassy employees,'' the department said
in a travel advisory.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said the threat was serious enough to
force the U.S. ambassador to Macedonia, Christopher Hill, to
postpone a trip to Tirana planned for Friday. Hill is trying to
mediate an end to fighting between the Serbian military and ethnic
Albanians in the disputed region of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The embassy in Albania is one of several U.S. embassies and
other diplomatic installations that have suspended some operations
as a result of threats issued after the bombings in East Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities evacuated the U.S. Embassy in Bern, the Swiss
capital, Friday after receiving phone threats. A police spokesman
said that an anonymous caller had warned that ``something is going
to happen at 5 p.m.'' at the embassy. The hour passed without
incident, and investigators said they found nothing suspicious in a
search of the embassy compound.

SINGH GRABS THE LEAD AT SAHALEE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE CONCANNON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDMOND, Wash. _ They always seem to forget Vijay Singh when
they talk about the best players who have never won a major golf
championship. They shouldn't.
</P>
<P>
   There he was in Friday's second round of the 80th PGA
Championship at Sahalee CC, grabbing the lead in the early hours of
a long sorting-out process. He checked in with a
course-record-tying 66 for a 4-under-par 136 total and and headed
to the practice range.
</P>
<P>
   This is Singh's trademark. Nobody spends more time at the range,
on the putting green, or striving to win. ``I like to practice,''
said Singh. ``There's always something you can work on. If it's not
the long game, it's the short game. Or the putting. You can never
practice enough putting. I just like to practice and I'm always
working on something out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Singh had left the practice range by the time Steve Stricker
seized the lead with a birdie on the 16th. But Stricker took a
double bogey on the 17th and Singh's score stood up by a shot over
Stricker (68), Colin Montgomerie (67), and Scott Gump (69). The
grouping at 138 included Rhode Island's Brad Faxon (68),
Australia's Steve Elkington (69), Andrew Magee (68), defender Davis
Love III (68), and first-round leader Tiger Woods (72), who had set
the course record Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Singh opened with birdies on the first (9-iron, 4 feet) and
second (two putts) and added birdies on the fourth (wedge, 12
feet), seventh (8-iron, 20 feet), and ninth (5-iron, 4 feet) to
make the turn in 30. The lid came off briefly on the 11th when he
bogeyed by taking two putts from 10 feet. After a birdie on the
13th when he hit an 8-iron tee shot to 8 feet, he bogeyed the 17th
out of a bunker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the key was the start of my round,'' said the native
of Fiji. ``I kept my round going from there on, and that gave me
confidence. I hit a lot more greens today than I did Friday, and
obviously, I putted a lot better. You've got to putt well on greens
like this. It's getting hard and fast. If you're on the correct
side of the pin, you have a good chance of making birdies. That's
what I did today.''
</P>
<P>
   Gump quietly slipped into the top group and could have led
outright except for bogeys on the 15th and 16th. ``I had a chance
to space myself a little bit,'' said Gump. ``I haven't been in this
position too many times, so I'm having fun.''
</P>
<P>
   He is noted as one of the most accurate drivers on the PGA Tour,
and Sahalee is a course that demands accuracy. ``That's mu strong
point,'' said Gump. ``I just stayed patient, hit fairways, hit the
greens.''
</P>
<P>
   Montgomerie finished with a bogey on the 18th but is where he
wants to be entering the weekend. ``I think I've gotten the best
out the first two rounds that I could do,'' he said of a round that
included a birdie on the 16th, leaving him 4 under. ``Putting today
was good. I had a number of 20-footers that went in. Where the pins
were tricky, I just played conservatively and played percentage
golf.''
</P>
<P>
   Faxon seemed on his way to a vintage round but found the left
rough on the 18th and had to play a safe shot out to the right side
of the fairway. He ended up missing a par putt from 15 feet. ``I
played very well today,'' said Faxon. ``It's a little like Pebble
Beach. You have to get off to a good start. I'm excited.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods encountered trouble on the second when his second shot on
the par-5, 507-yard hole went over the green and he ended up
lipping out on a misread putt for par. He bogeyed the fourth and
sixth before running off eight straight pars that preceded a bogey
on the 15th. He birdied the 16th to stay in the hunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just one of those rounds where I didn't hit the ball
particularly well,'' said Woods. ``I didn't give myself a lot of
chances for birdies, but I hung in there and my short game was
great today. I made a lot of good saves. I'm pleased to shoot 72
the way I hit the ball all day. I'm only two back, and that's
perfect. That's where I really need to be. If they put a lot of
water on the course with the (predicted) cooler conditions, it will
play really soft. If they don't, it will be firm and very fast.''

TWO WOULD-BE PARTNERS SEE SHARES PLUNGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DAVID J. MORROW   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shares of two makers of telecommunications equipment, Ciena
Corp. and Tellabs Inc., partners in a pending $7.1 billion merger,
plunged Friday, after Ciena announced that its third-quarter
profits would be less than half what had been expected.
</P>
<P>
   Investors stampeded out of the stocks on speculation that
Tellabs' acquisition of Ciena, which had been approved by both
companies' boards, would be scrapped.
</P>
<P>
   On the Nasdaq market, shares of Ciena fell $17.625, or 23.9
percent, to $54.125, while Tellabs shares dropped $13.6875, or 19
percent, to $58.125. The two stocks were the most actively traded
Friday on U.S. markets. When the deal, a one-for-one stock swap,
was announced in June, a mere 62.5 cents separated the value of the
two stocks.
</P>
<P>
   In a briefing with analysts, the chief executive of Tellabs,
Michael Birck, tried to put investors' fears to rest, stressing
repeatedly that both companies had reaffirmed their commitment to
the deal being completed. He also said that the acquisition would
still be for the long-term good of both companies.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had long considered Ciena's operations to be high risk,
but few expected the company to post such a setback. Ciena, which
makes equipment that can increase the capacity of long-distance
networks by a factor of 16 or more, warned that its third-quarter
profit would fall between 13 cents and 15 cents a share. According
to a survey by First Call Corp., an investment research company,
analysts had expected Ciena to earn 32 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Nettles, Ciena's chief executive, attributed his
company's troubles to a delay in a $25 million order and a major
discount that was given to a large customer in exchange for future
volume sales. After listing these problems, Nettles added, ``Our
business is sound; our market is sound.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ciena's unexpected shortfall in earnings has raised
suspicions that its operations are not as sound, and its
market-leading equipment is not as immune to competitors, as was
once believed. Lucent Technologies, North America's largest maker
of telecommunications equipment, would love to oust Ciena as the
lead maker of its product.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had other worries. Awarding a steep discount to one
customer suggested that Ciena's market lead for its equipment was
not very large. There were also doubts about whether Ciena would
land a large contract with AT&AMP;T, the United States' largest phone
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most upsetting thing about Ciena's announcement is the
deterioration of the company's gross margins,'' said Michael
Neiberg, an analyst with Ing Barings Furman Selz. ``They need to be
over 50, but we think in the third quarter they dropped to the mid-
to low 40s.''
</P>
<P>
   Ciena, though, should fare well from its acquisition by Tellabs.
Ciena, which has a small number of products and a limited
distribution system, would remedy both shortcomings with the deal.
Tellabs, which makes systems that allow circuits to communicate
without being soldered together, would immediately become the
market leader in wave division multiplexing equipment, Ciena's
product line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect the merger to take place and to go through at the
original terms,'' said Steven Levy, managing director at Lehman
Brothers. ``With this deal, Ciena reduces the risk that some
customer can say: `Poof. Give me a discount or I won't buy anything
more from you.'''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   (italics)In light of the market's recent declines, The New York
Times interviewed three families with differing investment
philosophies to see what, if any, adjustments they were making. The
Times also asked certified financial planners to review the
portfolios and, if needed, make recommendations. The results
suggest that investors have convinced themselves that sticking with
stocks is the conservative thing to do.(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Roger Pettett, a retailer in Phoenix who owns about 70 stocks,
doesn't panic anymore when the market's down. ``I'm not selling or
even thinking about it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This is a big change in attitude. Pettett, 58, said that until
about a year ago, he had been ``a real hair-trigger'' investor _
making as many as 100 trades annually, buying a stock, then bailing
at the first hint of trouble, only to watch it recover and then
some.
</P>
<P>
   He blames his behavior on his business: retail close-outs. His
chain of Back Alley stores sells surplus goods at bargain prices.
``I'm used to getting in and out and making a quick buck,'' he
said. ``I tried the same thing with stocks, and it doesn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   In January, as a long-term move, Pettett put half of his
mid-six-figure investment account into blue-chip companies with
dividend reinvestment plans. He split the money among 30 or so
stocks, including Compaq Computer and Home Depot.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of his stock holdings are in about 40 growth stocks,
more than a dozen of them small Arizona companies. Over all, about
85 percent of his money is invested in stocks; the rest is in bank
certificates of deposit.
</P>
<P>
   Pettett, who is married and has four grown children, wonders why
he didn't adopt a buy-and-hold strategy sooner.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids are raised. The house is paid,'' he mused. ``I don't
have the pressure on me.''
</P>
<P>
   Reviewing Pettett's investments, Stephen Barnes, a fee-only
certified financial planner in Phoenix, didn't see a need to make
major changes. ``I get the feeling the portfolio you've built is
consistent with the risk you can withstand,'' he told Pettett. ``As
long as that's the case, you'll be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Barnes recommended some fine-tuning: cutting the number
of stocks; diversifying by moving into other asset classes, like
foreign stocks or real estate, and adding bonds for some stability.
</P>
<P>
   Pettett said he had already trimmed his stock holdings, though
``it does need more.'' He is interested in foreign stocks and says
his next move may be into a fund of Japanese stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Dawn Gilbertson &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Alan and Vicki Schechter of Dix Hills, N.Y., were vacationing in
Lake Louise, Alberta, when the Dow swooned 299 points on Aug. 4.
Hearing the news, Schechter, 51, chief financial officer at
Lutheran Medical Center in Brooklyn, called in to check his
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got aggravated,'' said Ms. Schechter, 49, a librarian at
Frank P. Long Intermediate School in Bellport, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just lasted for a second,'' her husband responded. ``The
scenery was too pretty.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing could have mellowed Schechter during the market meltdown
11 years ago. Though he preaches the gospel of buying on dips, his
reaction to the October 1987 crash was to sell _ a lot. ``I really
regretted doing it,'' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   So despite the latest downturn, which was much less severe, the
Schechters are not changing their investment mix, which they call
conservative.
</P>
<P>
   Each has an employer-sponsored retirement plan, invested mainly
in Fidelity Investment funds like Fidelity Fund, Equity-Income II
and Growth and Income. They also have a brokerage account with
about nine stocks, including Microsoft, IBM and Pfizer; index
funds, and a tax-exempt money-market fund.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Schechter said he might use some of those cash reserves to buy
more shares of stocks he owns that are off their highs.
</P>
<P>
   With their two children finished with school, the couple's main
objective is financial independence. Given their aggressive saving
_ the two have contributed 10 percent of their annual salaries over
the last 30 years to their retirement plans _ and the market's
great run, Schechter thinks they are close to their goal,
regardless what the market does in the short term.
</P>
<P>
   Reviewing the Schechters' portfolio, George Toth, a certified
financial planner at Chestnut Investment Advisory in Erdenheim,
Pa., said the couple did a ``great job'' of accumulating assets
through disciplined investing. But he was concerned that they might
have too much money in large stocks and large-stock mutual funds,
both of which track the market and put them at more risk than they
might realize.
</P>
<P>
   For diversification, he suggested putting about 15 percent of
their retirement money in a convertible bond fund _ at least
temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   Toth also said the Schechters needed to figure out their
downside risk and set price targets for their stocks and funds _
and to get out if those targets were hit.
</P>
<P>
   Schechter dismissed the recommendation to diversify (``The
economy was built on these large, well-capitalized companies'') and
added that he didn't need to set price floors because he's a
long-term holder. ``Over a 5-to-10-year period, I think they're all
going to rise.''
</P>
<P>
   Dawn Gilbertson &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Frank Leon, 46, a regional sales manager in Coral Springs, Fla.,
for the software maker Visiontek, offers this market advice: don't
shoot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back then in '87, there were guys who shot themselves, guys
who shot their stockbrokers; if they had just waited a few weeks,
it would have changed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Faith in long-term prospects has allowed Leon and his wife,
Darlene, 41, to endure the market's recent swings calmly. Such
equanimity is especially impressive because Leon accepted an
early-retirement package from Motorola last year and has since seen
the company's stock _ he owns about 3,500 shares or options _ fall
from a high of about $80 to about $50 today.
</P>
<P>
   Leon began investing in stocks in the early 1980s, putting money
into technology stocks and amassing a portfolio worth about
$180,000. He also contributed the maximum to his 401(k), which was
worth $316,000 when he left last September after 22 years.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Leon also has about $17,000 in an individual retirement
account from a marketing job at Mitel, a telecommunications
company, which she left about 14 years ago to raise their children,
Danielle, now 13, and Jenna, now 9. After Leon retired, the couple
put their combined assets in the hands of a certified professional
planner, Ernie G. McMullen of Noble International Investment in
Boca Raton, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``The portfolio was really nondiversified,'' McMullen said. But
the Leons had little debt, except for a $185,000 home mortgage.
Since they had prepaid about $60,000 for their children's college
tuition, the Leons' goal was to save for retirement.
</P>
<P>
   McMullen cut the concentration on technology. He also
reallocated several international funds Leon had bought, moving
into mostly long-term growth and international growth funds.
</P>
<P>
   In the last six months McMullen has also built cash to nearly 20
percent of the portfolio, as a defensive measure.
</P>
<P>
   Reviewing the portfolio, Bob Klosterman, president of White Oaks
Wealth Advisors in Minneapolis, agreed with many of the fund picks,
but recommended further diversification and _ despite the market's
recent wobbling _ a reduction in cash.
</P>
<P>
   He also suggested trimming Leon's Motorola holdings. But if Leon
cashes out before September, the proceeds will be taxed as income;
if he waits, it will be taxed at the lower capital-gains rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you have to weigh between 20 percent tax and 20
percent loss,'' Klosterman said.
</P>
<P>
   Unworried, Leon is standing pat. ``If you look at the pattern of
the market from 1900, it always goes up,'' he said. Plus, he
doesn't own a gun.

<P>
   The bungee-like gyrations in the stock market the last two weeks
may have scared away the faint of heart, but for money managers who
are paid to stomach such swings, a plunge is simply a chance to
pick up shares of solid companies on the cheap.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Baron, who runs the Baron Asset fund, was buying Libbey
Inc. as it hit new lows on Tuesday, when the Dow Jones industrial
average fell 225 points before springing back up to end the day off
111.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a week earlier, on Aug. 5, the day after the market
suffered a 299-point decline, Christian A. Felipe, who heads the
MFS Massachusetts Investors Growth fund, stepped in to buy shares
of the Promus Hotel Corp., then trading at record lows.
</P>
<P>
   Computer-driven buyers got into the act, too. On July 27, Jeff
Tyler, co-portfolio manager at the American Century Income and
Growth fund, crunched the cold, hard numbers on the Tommy Hilfiger
Corp. and started adding shares to his fund.
</P>
<P>
   Listening to their reasons, one gets the sense that it doesn't
take courage so much as conviction to buy a plunging stock. All
these managers strongly believe in a turnaround, a takeover bid or
a mathematical formula. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Christian A. Felipe &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Promus escaped much of the sell-off on Aug. 4, but after the
market closed, the company announced that Raymond E. Schultz, chief
executive, and Richard M. Kelleher, president, would resign, as
would two directors. The shake-up was a result of the clashing
corporate cultures of Promus and Doubletree, which merged last
December.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which owns and franchises 1,200 hotels in North
America under the Doubletree, Embassy Suites and Hampton Inn
banners, among others, was also sucked down by market fears that
the hotel industry had hit a cyclical peak.
</P>
<P>
   Promus, which had lost just 75 cents on Aug. 4, fell 22 percent
on Aug. 5, to an intraday low of $26.50.
</P>
<P>
   Felipe, 38, didn't hesitate as he reached for a buy ticket.
While he declined to say how many Promus shares he has bought, the
company, based in Memphis, now ranks among the fund's top 15
holdings.
</P>
<P>
   ``This stock is a takeover candidate,'' he declared, adding that
he expected the Bass brothers, Marriott International, Hilton
Hotels or a similar hotel company to bid more than $50 a share for
Promus.
</P>
<P>
   Felipe has been the portfolio manager of MFS Massachusetts
Investors Growth since 1995. The fund, with $3.56 billion in
assets, invests in big companies with steady growth potential.
</P>
<P>
   This year, through Aug. 12, the fund's A shares returned 18.7
percent, compared with 16.2 percent for the average
large-capitalization growth fund, according to Morningstar Inc. of
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Even without a takeover offer, Promus, which is trading at less
than 16 times 1998 earnings, still fits in Felipe's portfolio
because of what he called its ``very valuable brand franchise.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he expected the company to earn $2.10 a share this year
and $2.65 next year. While the industry may be saturated at the low
end, he said there was still room to grow in the mid-price segment
where Promus operates. ``It's only a matter of time.'' he added,
``before this company is gone.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Baron &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't just a bad week for Libbey, the maker of restaurant
glasses and tableware. The company has had a bad year. Its stock
declined gradually, but steadily, from a high of $41 last December
to close at $32 on Tuesday; it now trades at $31.125.
</P>
<P>
   But Ronald Baron, 55, manager of the Baron Asset fund, didn't
care. He has owned Libbey stock for a couple of years, and on
Tuesday he bought 30,000 shares for an average price of $31.41. He
now has $78 million, or 1.5 percent, of the fund's assets invested
in the company, which is based in Toledo, Ohio, making Libbey the
fund's 18th-largest holding.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Baron is a long-term, out-of-the-box thinker, and his portfolio
shows it. Baron Asset has half of its money in about a dozen
small-capitalization stocks, including Sotheby's and Ralph Lauren,
and the fund has a very low turnover rate _ 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Baron likes Libbey because it is shielded from new competition
by the high costs of furnaces and glass molds. Ninety percent of
Libbey's orders come from restaurants' replacement of inventory.
``It's a good, stable, modestly growing business,'' he said.
``Their costs are stable and now they have production outside the
country'' in Mexico, which should help cut costs.
</P>
<P>
   Libbey is adding more flatware to its product lines while
pressing to sell more glasses, dishes and bud vases to consumers
through department stores and other retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Baron is obviously more bullish on Libbey than many of
his peers. ``Wall Street thinks they can make between $2.50 and
$2.60 this year; I think they can make $2.80,'' he said, referring
to per-share earnings.
</P>
<P>
   His investors hope he is right. The market has been unkind to
small-cap stocks this year, and Baron Asset, which has $5.25
billion under management, was down 4.0 percent for the year through
Aug. 12, compared with 3.3 percent for the average small-cap growth
fund. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Tyler &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Hilfiger, the designer who turned sweatshirts into a
fashion statement, saw his company's stock tumble almost 30 percent
from a high of $70.375 on June 3. When it fell below $50 on July
27, Jeff Tyler's computer screens were aglow.
</P>
<P>
   The way Tyler, 40, figures it, the company's stock was ``guilty
by association'' with those of weaker garment makers like Liz
Claiborne, which not only reported disappointing second-quarter
earnings, but also warned investors that its second-half results
might be ugly, too.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Hilfiger ``was a stock that had been attractive, but with
the way the market was being abused, Tommy became a lot more
attractive,'' Tyler explained. ``We picked up on it and increased
our position.''
</P>
<P>
   As co-manager of American Century Income and Growth, with $3.36
billion in assets, Tyler uses three complex formulas to pick
stocks. The first looks at a company's price-to-earnings and
price-to-cash-flow ratios, as well as stock price and earnings
momentum _ the pace and direction of upward and downward changes in
those numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Based on those criteria, a company is scored on a scale of 0 to
100, with higher scores being better. Hilfiger boasted a score of
95, versus 48 for the average company in the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500-stock index.
</P>
<P>
   Then Tyler uses a second model to look at the changes in
analysts' earnings estimates and the likelihood of an earnings
surprise. In January, for example, analysts projected that Hilfiger
would earn $1 a share in the fourth quarter, but the most recent
survey showed a consensus estimate of $1.15. Again, a company is
ranked from 0 to 100. Hilfiger scored 94, compared with 47 for the
average company in the S&AMP;P 500.
</P>
<P>
   ``A company that has good earnings momentum will score
favorably, especially if it is getting abused unfairly from the
viewpoint of analysts and our model,'' Tyler said.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he uses a third, so-called pure-valuation model that
pegs a stock as cheap or pricey based on _ among other things _ its
price-to-cash flow ratio in relation to the overall market.
</P>
<P>
   It ranks a stock on a scale of (plus)20 to (minus)20, with
high-scoring companies being cheaper and, hence, better buys.
Hilfiger scored a (minus)13, making it a fair bit more expensive
than the average company in the S&AMP;P 500, which nets a (minus)6. But
Hilfiger's score on the two other measures made up for that.
</P>
<P>
   Through Aug. 12, Tyler's fund has returned 12.1 percent for the
year compared with 3.4 percent for the average large-cap value
fund.

THE GRAND JURY: AN UNPLEASANT MEMORY FOR CLINTON AIDES 
</HEADLINE>
   (See also: CLINTON-DEFENSE, CLINTON-ISOLATION, CLINTON-NH-VOICES)  
 (bl)  
 By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ ``I came to call it the `Darkness at Noon' suite,''
said Sidney Blumenthal, President Clinton's communications
coordinator, grimly recalling the bland yet fearsome grand jury
room where dozens of administration workers have been questioned by
federal prosecutors these past seven months, 12 blocks east of the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   For Clinton believers who grandly imagined capping their careers
as public servants at the West Wing inner sanctum of power, their
unexpected detour to the grand jury of Independent Counsel Kenneth
Starr, has provided a starker White House memento than they ever
bargained for.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an experience I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy,'' said
former White House chief of staff Leon Panetta, who was among the
many administration witnesses summoned. ``First, that gauntlet of
intimidation outside,'' he recalled, referring to the crowd of news
media encamped on the courthouse sidewalks since January. ``And
then going into what is a pretty cold place _ a building that's a
throwback to the days of J. Edgar Hoover _ and waiting alone in a
barren hallway to be called in for the questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's appearance before the Starr grand jury Monday will be
significantly different from the experience his underlings have
been enduring. For one thing, he will remain in the White House,
far from the media gauntlet, and he will testify by remote
television hookup, with the 23-member grand jury listening and
watching his testimony elsewhere in their own closed room. For
another, the president, far from testifying alone as is the grand
jury norm, will have a lawyer on hand.
</P>
<P>
   Officials will not discuss details of the secret session, but
the television signal of Clinton under oath is expected to involve
state-of-electronics encryption to foil possible snoops.
</P>
<P>
   It remains unclear whether the grand jurors will have free rein
to ask him questions or be limited at best to channeling them
through the prosecuting staff. In any case, witnesses describe the
grand jury as just the sort of cross-section audience that Clinton
favors as a speaker _ mostly African-American, tending toward 50
years of age and older, with more women than men, according to the
accounts of several witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The soundproof, if not quite leakproof, grand jury room on the
third floor of the E. Barrett Prettyman courthouse has come to loom
gothically over the White House as the jurors tracked Starr's
pursuit of the president. A wide assortment of anxious Clinton
aides, bodyguards and factotums have been summoned and ordered to
answer honestly under the standard court oath _ ``so help you
God.''
</P>
<P>
   The grand jury, which needs 16 members for a quorum, has sat as
a watchful, sometimes openly curious panel of anonymous city
residents quietly gauging the truth of what they hear.
</P>
<P>
   The jury, charged to operate in secrecy, was convened last
September to handle the waning phase of the dry, complex Whitewater
inquiry into the decade-old land and political dealings of Clinton
as governor of Arkansas. But the jurors were jolted onto a
sensational tangent in January when the sex-and-mendacity
allegations involving former White House intern Monica Lewinsky
were first directed at the president and assigned to Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Those few witnesses who care to recall the grand jury experience
offer widely differing impressions about the long-running tattoo of
questions and answers. To track the proceedings, jury members have
taken personal notes that are locked away by federal marshals after
each session. Eventually the notes will be destroyed, with jurors
sworn to a permanent secrecy.
</P>
<P>
   A few witnesses cite frightening, bare-knuckled questioning by
the Starr assistants as jurors listened passively. Others recall
jurors bored to sleepiness by repetitious questions, a prosecutor's
technique that wary White House witnesses were alert to as a
possible perjury-trap.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time you're kind of nervous, but like everything
else it becomes routine,'' said former Clinton political strategist
George Stephanopoulos, sounding resigned to the multiple grand jury
visits _ three in his case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I saw REM sleep from a few during my stint,'' one
witness said. Another recalled the scene as gray and bureaucratic.
Jurors would be marched out for coffee breaks as the lawyers
reloaded their questions for the difficult, tedious mission of
strafing for chinks in the presidential armor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The surprising thing is the common impression of Ken Starr,''
said Blumenthal, who appeared three times. ``That impression _
Starr's obsessional pursuit, his bearing down on witnesses, getting
blood from the stone _ none of that ever happened. To my knowledge,
as we say in the grand jury, Starr's never there.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But that has largely proved beside the point to the many Clinton
supporters subpoenaed under Starr's signature to face assistants
far more experienced than he is in the sharp-edged art of grand
jury inquisition.
</P>
<P>
   Some witnesses found the jury members mute vassals of a
prosecutor who asked all the questions. ``It's the proverbial grand
jury ready to indict a ham sandwich,'' said one witness, speaking
anonymously and angrily. ``They're Starr's to shape, and they show
no sign they could be in control of this process.''
</P>
<P>
   Other witnesses recall surprising moments of grand jury spunk.
Bob Weiner, a White House aide subpoenaed by Starr, described being
peppered by nonstop rephrasings of the same question even as he
sought to exercise his right to take a break and confer with his
attorney waiting, as allowed by law, outside the jury room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally, some woman on the jury simply interrupted and said,
`We'll take a 10-minute recess now,''' said Weiner, rating the
moment a scrap of mercy in a thoroughly unpleasant experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``A horrendous situation, and you feel it in your gut,'' he
said. ``You feel very much beyond your pay grade, a pawn in a game
of Get-the-President.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Blumenthal, Weiner was one of the feisty few who later
emerged on the courthouse steps to criticize Starr's proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Starr hearings are the McCarthy hearings of our era,''
said Weiner, who followed up his appearance with a letter demanding
an apology from Starr. ``In retaliation, Starr slapped me with
another subpoena, this time for my private phone records,'' added
Weiner, delighted that the phone company declined to honor the
independent counsel's request that the subpoena be kept secret from
Wiener.
</P>
<P>
   For Panetta, his point of pride is that, unlike virtually all
the other witnesses who have been paying out a collective fortune
in legal fees, he resolved not to hire a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a lawyer,'' he said. ``I didn't want to pay someone $300
an hour for me to be recollecting what I already know.'' A good
thing, Panetta added, for he was indeed questioned for three hours,
but mainly about the White House floor plan, a mundane topic that
he said consumed 90 percent of the questioning. ``The other 10
percent was about whether I had ever seen the president with Monica
Lewinsky,'' Panetta said. ``I had not and basically said so.''

HINGIS SHOWS TALK IS CHEAP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE STEVENS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANHATTAN BEACH, Calif. _ Don't talk trash about Martina Hingis
before playing her in a match.
</P>
<P>
   That's what Richard Williams should have learned Friday when
Hingis beat his daughter, Serena Williams, 6-4, 6-1 in the
quarterfinals of the Acura Classic at Manhattan Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday evening, Richard Williams _ excited that Serena won
her first-round match over Larisa Neiland 6-0, 6-0 _ said on a
local TV station that if Hingis and his daughter met, Serena would
``kick her (tail).''
</P>
<P>
   Hingis, ranked first on the Corel WTA tour, saw the telecast and
said it gave her extra motivation. ``He should sometimes watch his
mouth, watch what he's saying,'' Hingis said. ``He won't be saying
that for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   The trash talking, which is becoming more prevalent on the
women's tennis tour, continued on Hingis' part in a postmatch news
conference. Hingis did not appear angry with Richard or Serena
Williams, smiling as she spouted many words on various subjects,
including Serena's place in the Williams family, which includes
tennis star and sister Venus.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's like the black sheep in the family,'' Hingis said.
``Everyone is focused on Venus right now because she's No.5 in the
world.... Now, she got the opportunity to play and had to face me,
so that's kind of bad luck for her.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Hingis' statements, she and Serena Williams each said
that they are friends. Hingis added that she was not angry at her
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's Serena's fault, all their talk about her,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Serena Williams refused to answer questions about Hingis' extra
motivation. Richard Williams attended the postgame news conference
but did not field a question about his statement.
</P>
<P>
   Serena Williams said her inconsistency keyed Hingis' win. On
Wednesday, Williams said that she could beat Hingis, but that
depended on who attended the match _ a good Serena or bad Serena.
</P>
<P>
   When asked which Serena played Hingis, she said, ``I think this
is a serious press conference, so the serious Serena showed up.''
</P>
<P>
   Hingis agreed that Williams was hurt by inconsistency. Williams'
shots and intensity wavered.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's very aggressive from the first shot, but after the first
two shots, she slows down,'' Hingis said. ``She was like a treasure
box. She'd hit a great point, then miss two. You didn't know what
to expect from her.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, 16, was playing in her first tournament in six weeks,
after taking time off to attend summer school. She was more
consistent in the first set. Her inconsistency became obvious near
the end of the match, when she missed two overheads in the final
two games. One of the misses was on a set point, so Hingis won the
63-minute match on a gift. She has beaten Williams in both of their
meetings.
</P>
<P>
   But the 20th-ranked Williams still impressed the top-rated
player.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not as strong as her,'' Hingis said. ``I'm not a
bodybuilder like her. She can go boxing. She's a big girl.''
</P>
<P>
   And the saga between the big girl and top player probably will
not end when they leave Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely can see this developing as a rivalry,'' Williams
said. ``We're going to meet many more times. She's not going
anywhere and I'm not going anywhere.''

ARIZONA REP. STUMP AGAIN PROTESTS NON-MILITARY ARLINGTON BURIALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By ADRIANNE FLYNN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For the second time this month, Rep. Bob Stump is
protesting the burial of non-military fallen Americans in the
nation's premiere veteran's cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Friday, Stump, chairman of the House Veterans
Affairs Committee, said, ``It's wrong'' to bury in Arlington
National Cemetery three employees of the American embassy who were
killed in the terrorist blast in Kenya on Aug. 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are displacing three of our military people. We've got no
more ground there,'' Stump said.
</P>
<P>
   What space remains in crowded Arlington should be reserved for
select military heroes, Stump said, and he's working on a law that
would mandate just that.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Stump criticized the burial of Capitol Police
detective John Gibson in Arlington for the same reason (Gibson had
no military service), although he acknowledged that Gibson was a
true hero.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson was killed inside the U.S. Capitol after a gunman forced
his way past security and began firing. Another Capitol Police
officer was killed and a tourist wounded. The second officer
killed, Jacob Chestnut, was qualified for burial in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   This week, President Clinton, at the request of the State
Department, granted waivers from the strict Arlington burial rules
for Julian Bartley, 55, the Kenyan embassy consul general;
Bartley's 20-year-old son, Jay, who had a summer job at the
embassy; and Prabhi Kavaler, 45, a native of India who worked for
the general services office in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the Americans killed in the bombing attack were
killed on active duty in the military service and are therefore
qualified for an Arlington burial.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Stump won a unanimous House vote for his bill that
would end waivers of the cemetery's burial requirements and limit
interment rights to those killed on active duty, those who retired
from military service, and those who won either a Purple Heart or
Silver Star.
</P>
<P>
   Stump originally drafted the legislation to separate burial
waivers from politics after controversy over a Clinton
administration waiver that permitted the Arlington burial of the
late Ambassador Larry Lawrence, whose body was exhumed after it was
discovered that the major Democratic donor had lied about serving
in the Merchant Marine.
</P>
<P>
   Stump's bill is hung up in the Senate, where some in the upper
chamber are concerned it may prevent them from burial in Arlington.
Stump said he is working to satisfy Senate concerns by rewriting
the bill to again allow limited waivers. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   General Motors' marketing wizards have honed their Ginsu knives
to a razor's edge as they've sliced and diced the sport utility
market. Consider GM's lineup of compact utilities, all of them
variations on one basic platform:
</P>
<P>
   _ The Chevrolet Blazer comes in five trim levels, with two doors
or four, with or without four-wheel drive. The Blazer starts at
$22,178 and runs to $32,000 _ a new Trailblazer model for 1999 will
be $35,000 _ and competes mostly with the Ford Explorer and Jeep
Grand Cherokee. It is aimed at buyers in their mid-30s to late 40s
with an average household income of $60,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Oldsmobile Bravada, which comes only as a four-door with
all-wheel drive for about $33,000, is supposed to offer an
``understated'' alternative to imported luxury models to people
from 40 to 50, with household incomes of about $85,000. Olds hopes
to steal sales from the Mercedes-Benz ML320, Infiniti QX4 and Lexus
RX 300.
</P>
<P>
   _ The GMC Jimmy is available in four trim levels, with two or
four doors, with or without four-wheel drive. Starting at $22,351
and climbing into the low $30,000s, the Jimmy competes most
directly with the Grand Cherokee and Explorer, as well as with the
Mercury Mountaineer, Toyota 4Runner, Nissan Pathfinder and Isuzu
Rodeo. Typical buyers are in their mid-40s with household incomes
of $68,000 a year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Yet another model, the GMC Envoy, arrived this year. A
fancier, flashier version of the Jimmy, the Envoy is aimed at
buyers 34 to 49 with household incomes of more than $100,000 a year
who desire an ``expressive'' luxury sport utility, in contrast to
the toned-down Bravada. GMC sees the Envoy going against the Grand
Cherokee Limited and the Explorer Limited. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s and 80s, this slicing and dicing to create multiple
models from a single design was wryly known as ``badge
engineering'' _ the engineering consisted of sticking different
emblems on the fenders. Today, the buzzword is ``brand
management''; in either case, the results are different vehicles
that are much the same. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 GMC Envoy, along with the larger 1999 Yukon Denali, was
created in a bid to distinguish GMC as a premium alternative to
Chevrolet after decades in which trucks from the two divisions were
essentially the same. And though the Envoy is a Blazer/Jimmy
underneath, it is supposed to be the flagship of GM's compact sport
utilities.
</P>
<P>
   On the outside, the Envoy has a flashier appearance with
aluminum wheels, a single-color grille, a different bumper and
high-intensity-discharge headlamps. The high-tech headlamps emit a
distinctive blue-white light, and they require an automatic
load-leveling suspension to keep them properly aimed. In contrast
to the Jimmy, the Envoy comes only with four doors, and four-wheel
drive is standard. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Inside, the Envoy is outfitted in two-tone, double-stitched
leather with the ``Envoy'' logo emblazoned on the headrests, and
Zebrano wood trim throughout the cabin. The Envoy's comfortable
seats are much fancier than those of the Jimmy, adjusting eight
ways, and they memorize two drivers' preferred settings.
</P>
<P>
   Standard features on the Envoy include a premium Bose AM/FM
stereo with cassette or CD player, electronic climate control, a
Homelink transmitter that opens garage doors and security gates,
remote keyless entry and a leather-wrapped steering wheel.
</P>
<P>
   For 1999, radio controls are being added to the steering wheel.
Standard safety equipment includes less forceful air bags,
anti-lock brakes and a theft-deterrent system. A sunroof is the
sole option.
</P>
<P>
   The platform, engine and automatic transmissions of the Envoy,
Jimmy, Blazer and Bravada are virtually identical. The platform was
redesigned for 1995 and its ride and handling were vastly improved.
But as has been the case with many recent GM redesigns, it did not
set new standards.
</P>
<P>
   The Envoy, like the other offsprings of the platform, is powered
by a 4.3-liter V6 engine, rated at 190 horsepower. In the Envoy,
the engine is paired with GM's four-speed electronic automatic
transmission. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Envoy distinguishes itself from the Jimmy in its suspension.
Different shocks give the Envoy a smoother highway ride. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And, in contrast to the Bravada, the Envoy has full off-road
capability. The Bravada is equipped with a full-time
all-wheel-drive system. The Envoy has a four-wheel-drive system
that can be turned on and off, and a low gear range for difficult
terrain.
</P>
<P>
   When the 1999 models go on sale in the fall, including the
Jimmy, they will include AutoTrac, a feature that allows the driver
to select between full-time all-wheel-drive or shift-on-the-fly
four-wheel drive.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 Envoy and Jimmy will also come with GM's tow/haul
feature; with the press of a button on the shift lever, it
automatically adjusts the transmission's shifting to suit a heavier
load.

   The Envoy is a perfectly fine luxury sport utility. Its ride is
comfortable, and it has virtually any amenity one could want. Its
price of $34,650 is on par with other well-trimmed compact sport
utilities.
</P>
<P>
   Yet nothing makes the Envoy stand out. It has considerably less
space than the Explorer. It lacks the off-roading tradition of the
Grand Cherokee. It is not as refined as the Infiniti QX4 or as
car-like as the Lexus RX 300. It scores lower on the prestige scale
than the Mercedes ML320. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Envoy has a lot of nice touches. But it costs $5,000 more
than the top-of-the-line Jimmy, and it is a new, unknown name going
against a lot of very tough, well-established competitors. With GMC
trying to make a luxury footprint, the Envoy is a step, but not a
big one. &QL;

   (NYT23) DOVER, N.H. -- Aug. 14, 1998 -- CLINTON-NH-VOICES-3,
8-14 -- New Hampshire residents are voicing yet another chorus of
defiant indifference to allegations that Clinton may have had
sexual contact with Monica Lewinsky. I think it's terrible for our
nation and I truly think it's not doing us any good around the
world,'' says Inez DiMambro, right, a 68-year-old housewife and
mother. ``He's the president,'' says shopping companion Diane King.
``He should act more presidential.'' (Rick Friedman/New York Times

``Ultimately, I think it's a travesty that people don't have better
things to do with this country than to investigate whether the

<P>
   &UR; FEATURE STORIES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   MUSICALS-REVIVALS (subslug) (New York) _ Audiences flocking to
the Martin Beck Theater for the current revival of ``The Sound of
Music'' could care less that many critics find the musical
irredeemably saccharine. With its famously tuneful score, this 1959
show, the last Rodgers and Hammerstein collaboration, is
comfortingly familiar. People watch dazed with happiness, bobbing
their heads, along with the Von Trapp children as they learn their
do, re, mi's, smiling with recognition as Maria lists her favorite
things. There is no glitz, no benumbing spectacle, no blaring
rock-ified orchestra, just good old-fashioned musical value and an
uplifting story. By Anthony Tommasini. (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   GABRIELE-MUNTER-ART (Undated) _ ``Gabriele Munter: The
Expressionist Years, 1903-1920,'' an exhibition of 70 paintings,
drawings and prints at the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts in Richmond
through Sept. 20. For students and knowledgeable admirers of
20th-century art, Munter (1877-1962) is little more than an elusive
presence in the annals of German Expressionism. For decades she has
been mentioned in these histories, when mentioned at all, as pupil
and companion of the Russian painter Wassily Kandinsky. By Roberta
Smith. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THEATER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SERBAN-CYMBELINE-THEATER (Undated) _ Andrei Serban, 55, the
theater director who was born in Romania and is currently the head
of the graduate acting program at Columbia University,
``Cymbeline'' opens Sunday night as part of the New York
Shakespeare Festival's 43rd season. By Andrea Stevens. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   AYCKBOURN-THEATER (London) _ It is no secret that, after 53
plays, Alan Ayckbourn relishes a challenge. And in play No. 49,
``Communicating Doors,'' the task he has posed for himself is this:
how to mold a comic thriller _ or even a scary farce _ while at the
same time shuttling his characters back and forth in time with an
abandon many a filmmaker might envy. By Matt Wolf. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FILM AND VIDEO &LR;
</P>
<P>
   KRIS-KRISTOFFERSON-FILMS (Undated) _ If sentimentality is the
tendency to show more than one feels, Kris Kristofferson is the
opposite of sentimental: the man who feels so much that he cannot
help but show it. He is what he wrote about, a walking
contradiction _ a Rhodes scholar propelled though life less by
reason than by impulse; a Golden Gloves boxer blessed with a poet's
understanding of irredeemable loss and late-night yearnings. Rugged
yet capable of being wounded, solitary yet reachable, he veers
between two styles: supremely laid back and wound tighter than
most. By Elizaeth Kaye. (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   FILMS4KIDS (Undated) _ Brief reviews of some films and their
suitability for children. This week: ``Ever After: A Cinderalla
Story''; ``Air Bud; ``Basketball.'' (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DANCE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   TROCKS-DANCE (New York) _ Es Ballets Trockadero de Monte Carlo,
a gay dance group that started in New York City in 1974, will
perform at the Joyce Theater for a week starting next Tuesday. By
Jennifer Dunning. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CLASSICAL &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ZEMLINSKY-MUSIC (Undated) _ The centenary of Alexander von
Zemlinsky's birth, 1971, prompted the first flurry of his music
revivals. In the 1980s his operas were brought back to life, and
there were several important recordings. Now James Conlon is
pressing the case again, with five Zemlinsky albums recorded under
his baton for EMI Classics in Cologne, Germany, and more to come.
By Paul Griffiths. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   BOTSTEIN-MUSIC (Undated) _ Who, in musical history, could have
guessed that a meddlesome figure like Leon Botstein would come
along? Not Mendelssohn, obviously. ``In everything I have written
down there is at least as much deleted as there is allowed to
stand,'' the composer told a friend around 1842. ``My `St. Paul'
originally had a third more numbers, which shall never see the
light of day.'' But Botstein, the American academic turned
conductor and festival director, has exposed those numbers to the
full glare of recordings. By James R. Oestreich. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; POP MUSIC  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   YIDDISH-MUSIC (Undated) _ For more than a century, Yiddish music
has survived in America. The melodic vernacular of displaced Jews
from Eastern Europe, it is a music of secular wit and religious
fervor, the music of a people in a conflicted dance with
assimilation. By Barry Singer. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   ADAM-COHEN-MUSIC (Undated) _ Adam Cohen, 26, the son of Leonard
Cohen, deserves points for jumping in over his head and infusing
some passion into a moribund folk-pop tradition. In the best songs
from his debut album ``Adam Cohen'' (Columbia) _ the nasty,
tormented ones _ this talented but still partly unformed songwriter
forces you to feel his anger, jealousy and frustration over various
erotic entanglements. By Stephen Holden. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ANTIQUES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   TEA-CEREMONY-ANTIQUES (Kyoto, Japan) _ Mrs. Mihoko Koyama, 88,
who for 40 years until 1991 had been collecting objects for the
Japanese tea cermony, are being exhibited in the Miho Museum in the
town of Shigaraki. By Rita Reif. (Moved).

GARCIAPARRA IS JUST ALL-AROUND GOOD GUY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Budgeted as Redsox-Comment)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ He still gets a sincere laugh out of his prank in Omaha
four years ago. It was two hours before the Red Sox faced the Twins
Friday night at Fenway Park, and there was Nomar Garciaparra in the
Boston clubhouse, shaking his head and laughing at his offbeat
concept of comedy. Four years later.
</P>
<P>
   ``You got to have fun,'' he said between giggles. ``I like to
fool around now and then.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the panicked group standing outside a downtown Omaha hotel
didn't think it was funny when Garciaparra and a couple of his
Georgia Tech teammates ran around the tornadophobic city yelling,
``Tornado!'' But perhaps they'll appreciate this: Nothing ever gets
old for this man, humor included.
</P>
<P>
   You could search his compact disc player now and find a very
modern hip-hopper named DMX. He is considering reinserting a trendy
crew called Bones, Thugs 'N Harmony back into his CD rotation, too.
But don't be fooled by that. Garciaparra's true hip-hop loves are
groups such as Eric B. and Rakim, a duo that was most popular in
the 1980s. It's a genuine oldie by today's standards, but,
Garciaparra explained, ``that was real hip-hop.''
</P>
<P>
   For the past two summers, we have watched Garciaparra play as if
he were controlling his own likeness in an unreal, videogame world.
He was Rookie of the Year last season. This year he's a top five
candidate for MVP. Think of what you do when he comes to the plate.
Isn't he one of the rare players you expect to get a hit almost
every time up?
</P>
<P>
   But if you went to your neighbor this morning and said, ``I
think Nomar Garciaparra is a terrific player,'' you might be asked
if you are a permanent resident of another place like, say,
Neptune.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to overlook greatness sometimes. It would be foolish
to do that with Garciaparra. It is not normal for 175-pound
shortstops to be a few RBIs away from 100 in mid-August. It also
isn't normal for such a shortstop to tell you that the hitting
streaks and home runs and gaudy plays in the field don't matter _
and mean it.
</P>
<P>
   What we now see at Fenway is a 25-year-old athlete who was
raised in the tradition of Jim Thorpe: Play everything, be good at
everything, learn the value of humility. Maybe Dan Duquette wasn't
exaggerating in the spring after announcing Garciaparra's contract
extension. At the time, the Duke implied that his shortstop eats
all his vegetables, chews his food exactly 32 times before
swallowing, and flosses after every meal.
</P>
<P>
   Next thing we know, Garciaparra will be asking Bobby Grier if he
can have a shot at playing running back for the Patriots. Well,
let's just say it wouldn't surprise me.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's exclusive property of the Red Sox,'' Duquette said last
night. ``For the next seven years.''
</P>
<P>
   But you get the feeling the man could be a Sox, Patriot, or
member of the Revolution if he wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was in high school, I played football, soccer, and
baseball,'' Garciaparra said. ``In California, soccer season was
during basketball season, so I could play all three sports. I've
been playing baseball and soccer since I was 6.''
</P>
<P>
   We are talking about a man who was kicking 60-yard field goals
in practice. A guy who was good enough to score 17 goals on his
high school soccer team during his senior year. A kid who told
himself he needed to get a football or soccer scholarship to
college and then try to ``walk on somebody's baseball team.''
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra has frustrated many media types by refusing to talk
about his statistics. It seems as if he is being unnecessarily
difficult. But long before the Sox picked him 12th overall in the
1994 draft, Garciaparra's father, Ramon, sat him down and told him
how to approach baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played every position growing up,'' he said. ``My dad told
me that I was going to play everything. So I knew how valuable the
catcher was, the right fielder was, the pitcher was ... Stats were
never important to me because it didn't tell me how good I did that
day or how bad I did that day. Numbers aren't going to tell me
that; I'm going to know myself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can go 4 for 4 and get jammed four times and have a terrible
day at the plate. It just means I got lucky. It doesn't mean I had
a good day. That's how I was taught to look at the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The philosophy never got old for Garciaparra. He doesn't sneak
into the clubhouse and gaze at stat sheets when cameras aren't
around. In fact, cameras usually aren't around precisely because he
is not seen as a media entertainer. But there are some charismatic
athletes you love to talk to but don't necessarily want batting
cleanup following Mo Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   You want that with Garciaparra. Doesn't it seem like 10 years
ago that you heard about a prospect named Garciaparra who was a
brilliant fielder but an average hitter? This Garciaparra and the
one who led off last year even seem like different players.
</P>
<P>
   If I had an MVP vote, Garciaparra would certainly be in the top
five. Alex Rodriguez and Ken Griffey would be there, too (although
I would penalize them for putting up great numbers on a bad team).
I would round out the list with a couple of Yankees (David Cone,
Derek Jeter).
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been many times this year when Nomar has played
like the best player in baseball,'' Duquette said.
</P>
<P>
   And that should never get too old to watch.

AN IRAQI DEFECTOR WARNS OF IRAQ'S NUCLEAR WEAPONS RESEARCH 
</HEADLINE>

on devel. of nuke bomb trigger, 3rd take.)   (EDS: Listed on some skeds as EXCLUSIVE-IRAQ-DEFECTOR; see also
IRAQ-NUKE-SCIENTIST)  
(js) 
 By JUDITH MILLER and JAMES RISEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   An Iraqi scientist who defected to the United States has
publicly described for the first time the inner workings of Iraq's
three-decade effort to build a nuclear bomb.
</P>
<P>
   The scientist, Khidhir Abdul Abas Hamza, said that before he
fled Iraq in 1994 he helped train a cadre of young scientists who,
working with more senior scientists involved in other projects,
would be capable of quickly resuming Iraq's atomic weapons program
if the United Nations cuts back on its inspections and, ultimately,
lifts economic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Hamza is the highest-ranking scientist ever to defect from
Baghdad, and his comments, in nearly 10 hours of interviews, come
as a new confrontation is building over whether Baghdad has
dismantled its chemical, nuclear and biological programs. Iraq has
in recent days refused to cooperate further with U.N. weapons
inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   In the interviews, Hamza, 59, whose defection was an important
intelligence coup for the United States that nearly slipped through
American fingers because of the CIA's inattention, drew a chilling
picture of life as an Iraqi scientist. He said his colleagues were
lavishly rewarded for their successes and tortured by the secret
police when they failed to deliver.
</P>
<P>
   He said Iraq's nuclear weapons program was personally directed
by Saddam Hussein, Iraq's leader, since its inception 27 years ago.
It was abetted, he said, by a host of Western companies, which sold
Iraq sophisticated equipment as they ``winked and laughed'' at
patently false cover stories.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the Persian Gulf War in 1991, Hamza said, Iraq had
completed all the research and testing needed for an atomic weapon
and was feverishly trying to make at least one crude bomb using
uranium from civilian reactors. This effort, Hamza said, could have
produced a bomb in a few months, but it was disrupted by the allied
bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Only after the war did U.S. intelligence officials learn that
they had grossly underestimated Iraq's nuclear program, which they
had believed to be 10 years from producing a nuclear bomb. But
Hamza's defection to the United States and his subsequent
debriefing by the CIA brought fresh details to light, including
these:
</P>
<P>
   Iraq's peaceful nuclear power program, begun 30 years ago, was
quickly turned into a cover for the secret bomb program, which went
ahead even as Baghdad opened up its research reactors to Western
inspection.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's intensive campaign in the 1970s and '80s to stop Iraq
from acquiring a bomb accomplished little. The 1981 Israeli bombing
raid that destroyed Iraq's French-built Osirak nuclear reactor
prompted Saddam to drop the pretense of a peaceful atomic effort
and to go ``full steam'' on a covert program to build a bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq took advantage of America's open access to valuable
scientific information. Hamza said that as a senior member of
Iraq's nuclear program, he spent time at American university
libraries studying the latest scientific journals and technical
accounts of America's nuclear efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Hamza, who intelligence officials said had been resettled here
by the CIA, said he was speaking out now because he was frustrated
that Saddam is still obstructing international inspections and
deceiving the West. U.S. officials said they did not authorize or
encourage Hamza to speak publicly, but they have confirmed many
elements of his account.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Hamza's defection has been a closely guarded secret.
A 1995 article in The Sunday Times of London and a 1997 book by
Andrew and Leslie Cockburn included detailed accounts of his
alleged kidnapping and assassination by secret Iraqi agents.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, his escape from Iraq is a remarkable spy yarn that
almost went awry. According to former and current intelligence
officials, the CIA initially rebuffed Hamza's appeals to defect to
the United States. He spent a year in Libya before the agency
realized its mistake and agreed to resettle him and rescue his
family from their home in downtown Baghdad.

</P>
<P>
   Born in southern Iraq into a family of Shiite Muslims, Hamza
graduated from Baghdad University and then studied physics in the
early 1960s at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and
Florida State University. After teaching briefly at Florida State
and a small college in Georgia, Hamza returned home in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   He became chairman of the physics department of Iraq's tiny
nuclear research center outside Baghdad, and was approached a year
later by two envoys from Saddam, who was then Iraq's vice president
but already its de facto ruler.
</P>
<P>
   He said they had asked him to help start a secret nuclear
weapons program under the cover of an expanded civilian atomic
energy program. Hamza said that though he had reservations about
building a nuclear bomb, he was enticed by the promise of extra
money and stature as well as the possibility that the civilian
program might benefit.
</P>
<P>
   A round of recent public hangings in Baghdad, he said,
underscored the dangers of refusing such a request.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, Hamza submitted Iraq's first comprehensive plan for
developing nuclear weapons to Saddam _ naming it the ``Hussein
plan.'' ``We didn't know then that Saddam hated his father and his
father's name,'' Hamza sheepishly recalled.
</P>
<P>
   The plan was quickly adopted, although Saddam rejected Hamza's
ambitious proposals for a separate nuclear city and lavish benefits
for its scientists. The Iraqi leader, he said, ``thought that a
separate atomic city would be too tempting a target for Iraq's
enemies.''
</P>
<P>
   At first, Hamza dealt with the leader through intermediaries.
But in 1973, he finally met his boss _ a volcanic encounter. During
a visit to the nuclear center, Saddam berated Hamza, his chief
planner, in front of his colleagues for failing to use frames to
display photographs of famous scientists on the office wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``The man was basically illiterate,'' Hamza said of Saddam.
``But here he was complaining about our insufficient respect for
great minds. I knew what he was doing: Saddam had to establish his
authority by putting the man who had made the plan in his place.''
</P>
<P>
   Saddam tightened his grip over the growing nuclear program in
1974, Hamza said, secretly naming himself chairman of the Iraqi
Atomic Energy Commission _ a fact that Iraq has denied to U.N.
inspectors. He also began controlling every aspect of the
scientists' lives, ordering them to divorce foreign wives and marry
Iraqi women, while forcing them to report any contact with
foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists ignored such orders at their peril. In January 1980,
Saddam had Iraq's most senior nuclear scientist, Jaafar D. Jaafar,
jailed and tortured until he agreed to work on an enrichment
program that would separate uranium particles and make bomb-grade
fuel. ``Jaafar was so badly beaten that he still jumps out of his
chair at the slightest scare,'' Hamza said.
</P>
<P>
   Hamza said he found it surprisingly easy to negotiate nuclear
cooperation agreements with the former Soviet Union, India, Brazil,
France and others to buy nuclear technology that could be used for
bombs under peaceful cover. ``If you go with the money and some
brains, it's easy to acquire the stuff,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, Iraq bought a French reactor and an Italian
fuel reprocessing facility, an IBM mainframe computer from the
United States, and machine tools to make centrifuge components from
the Swiss. In 1987 it almost bought for between $110 million and
$120 million a complete foundry to forge uranium and other
bomb-related components from Leybold and Degussa, two West German
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Hamza, who monitored the negotiations in Germany from a room
next to the meeting room, said the companies had offered to supply
not only the foundry but, for $200 million, a complete installation
that they promised could be built within months.
</P>
<P>
   He said Saddam rejected the tempting offer mainly because he
feared that such a large deal involving highly sensitive equipment
would have tipped off Western intelligence that Iraq was
transferring its bomb effort to a new site, known as Al Atheer.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we were astonished to see that the companies were actually
helping us find cover stories for some of the equipment we
needed,'' Hamza recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jorg Streitferdt, in-house counsel for Degussa, AG, based in
Frankfurt, Germany, which owned Leybold at the time, said the
companies did sell some equipment that ended up in Iraq's nuclear
program, and were later subjected to a series of investigations,
including a criminal inquiry by Germany.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that Degussa was exonerated on the charges of selling
vacuum furnaces to Iraq, largely because West Germany did not
require export licenses at that time for such sales. Though Degussa
executives suspected that Iraq might use the equipment for military
purposes given the ongoing Iran-Iraq war, he added, they did not
know that Iraq wanted it for a nuclear program.
</P>
<P>
   ``DeGussa and Leybold did not know what the equipment was for,''
Streitferdt said. ``The whole world did not know what Iraq was
about to do. We have learned our lesson and now have very tough
internal controls on our exports.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Years before Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait turned the country
into an international pariah, many of its nuclear-related purchases
were made with the blessing of the International Atomic Energy
Agency, the U.N. atomic energy monitors. The agency assumed that
Iraq was amassing the technical know-how for a peaceful power
program, and did little to investigate. The inspectors, Hamza said,
never asked even basic questions, ``like why an oil-rich country
like ours wanted nuclear power?''
</P>
<P>
   Hans Meyer, the spokesman for the IAEA, denied that the agency
had ignored warning signs that Iraq was trying to build a bomb.
``Our inspections were very tough,'' he said ``but under the rules
of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, we were only permitted to
inspect the facilities that Iraq had declared.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite such easy purchases, Hamza said, the program was beset
by almost constant setbacks _ the mysterious killings of senior
Iraqi nuclear scientists traveling in Europe, corruption, technical
blunders and vicious bureaucratic feuds among Iraq's scientists
seeking to generate bomb-grade enriched uranium. But Saddam had an
uncanny knack for turning such crises into opportunities, he said.
</P>
<P>
   After Israel bombed Iraq's reactor in 1981, the Iraqi leader
created the first completely independent, clandestine weapons
program, most of which remained hidden from Western inspectors for
nearly a decade. Liberated from having to march in lock step with
its peaceful cover, the nuclear weapons program staff grew from 400
to 7,000, Hamza said. And its budget soared.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when Iraq's bloody war with Iran was draining the
country's resources, nuclear scientists were insulated from the
war's economic ravages. The program was allotted as much as $150
million a month, Hamza said.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqi scientists were expected to produce results, and in
one crucial aspect of the program, they had little to show. Despite
years of effort, they had failed to produce the enriched uranium
that is an essential component in an atomic weapon.
</P>
<P>
   When Hussein Kamel, Saddam's ambitious son-in-law, took over the
nuclear program in 1987, Hamza said he helped him unmask a team of
scientists who were falsely claiming success in enriching uranium.
</P>
<P>
   Hamza was immediately named Iraq's director of weapons programs.
``I went to the palace'' he said, and ``emerged with a new car and
the title of a director general.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Kamel had ordered him to find a nuclear bomb trigger
while other scientists pursued at least five different methods of
separating uranium to make bomb-grade fuel. Hamza said that he had
purchased a trigger in Poland, which did not work well, but that
other Iraqi scientists developed a workable trigger in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. intelligence officials knew little of the Iraqi effort, in
part because the enrichment program relied on a technique abandoned
by the United States after the World War II Manhattan Project some
40 years earlier. ``They never put two and two together,'' Hamza
said.
</P>
<P>
   But the enrichment program was still slow to pay off, and Kamel
grew restless. The inevitable result was the onset of beatings and
torture for the scientists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hussein Kamel used to send scientists who displeased him to
the torture center in Al Taji,'' Hamza recounted. ``You couldn't
survive more than two weeks there.'' A director general of one
Iraqi nuclear program was beaten so badly that ``he couldn't come
to work for a week.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before the 1991 Gulf War, Kamel started a crash program
to develop a bomb. ``Kamel was crazy, but he managed to produce in
a month things that would normally take a year,'' Hamza said.
``Fear works well.''
</P>
<P>
   In December 1990 after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, Hamza said, he
asked to retire from the program. But he was told that he could do
so only if he agreed to stay on as a senior adviser and help train
Iraq's new generation of bombmakers.
</P>
<P>
   He left an important legacy. According to Hamza, the program had
perfected two methods for enriching uranium, and each could have
produced enough material to make a bomb in a year or two.
</P>
<P>
   Hamza witnessed the intensive American and allied bombing
campaign in the Persian Gulf War and was stunned at how little the
Americans and their allies knew about Iraq's program. More than
half of Iraq's major nuclear installations, most notably the
sprawling Al Atheer complex, the program's busy new weapons center,
were left largely untouched by the bombing raids.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Hamza's long-running bureaucratic feud with another
leading bomb scientist, the terror of working inside the Iraqi
police state and finally the killing of colleagues in the secret
program persuaded him to flee.
</P>
<P>
   The final straw came when the body of Adil Fayadh, one of Iraq's
chief nuclear procurement officers, was found near Hamza's farm.
``He had a farm next to mine,'' he said. ``They killed him and put
him in the ditch on his farm. It got me very worried. It had to be
Iraqi intelligence. That night, about two dozen people came to my
house, pale-faced and worried. They didn't know what was going to
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamza defected soon after, and he continues to anxiously follow
the Iraqi nuclear program from afar. He insisted that Saddam
remains determined to reconstitute the chemical, biological and
nuclear programs in which he invested so much. ``Without these
props, he would lose power,'' he said.

   RUSSIAN MARKETS RALLY ON HOPES OF RECOVERY
</P>
<P>
   Russia's financial markets rallied after the Kremlin and the
major Western powers indicated that they were working on plans to
end the nation's economic crisis. After losing almost 6.5 percent
of their value on Thursday, Russian blue-chip stocks regained about
4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But with banks still shaky and the memory of Thursday's panic
still fresh, brokers and analysts said they were not so much
optimistic about a solution as relieved that the free fall had
halted.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK, STILL BENIGN, FADES A BIT
</P>
<P>
   With Russia facing financial turmoil, Asia sinking deeper into
recession, President Clinton fighting for his political life and
the stock market swooning, the bright economic picture of the last
couple of years suddenly looks murkier. But the economy is not
likely to unravel anytime soon. Forecasters are counting on low
inflation, falling interest rates and confident consumers to keep
growth going in the year's second half.
</P>
<P>
   LOSS FOR TOBACCO REGULATORS
</P>
<P>
   A federal appeals court ruled that the Food and Drug
Administration does not have the authority to regulate cigarettes
or smokeless tobacco. The ruling is a setback to anti-smoking
groups, state attorneys general and members of Congress who had
used the threat of regulation to press the tobacco industry to
reimburse states for the health costs of smoking, and to limit
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   STRYKER TO BUY A UNIT OF PFIZER
</P>
<P>
   Stryker said that it had agreed to buy Pfizer's Howmedica
orthopedics unit for $1.9 billion, expanding its line of products
to repair injured joints and bones. Shares of Stryker fell 19
percent because the costs of the acquisition could slow the
company's growth.
</P>
<P>
   THAILAND APPROVES RESCUE PLAN
</P>
<P>
   Thailand approved a new program to salvage its financial system,
which has been crippled by recession, years of poorly planned
real-estate development and a currency devaluation. Getting lenders
back on their feet is vital to pulling the economy out of its first
recession in 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   McDONALD'S RESTATES RESULTS
</P>
<P>
   McDonald's Corp. restated its second-quarter net income to
reverse a $125 million charge for a new food-production system,
saying it would spread the charge gradually. The company said it
had made the change after discussions with the Securities and
Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION FELL IN JULY
</P>
<P>
   Industrial production decreased 0.6 percent in July, the second
consecutive monthly decline, as manufacturers struggled to overcome
sluggish Asian demand and the General Motors strikes cut auto and
truck output by 20 percent. Inflation remained tame at the
wholesale level. In a second report, the Labor Department said
producer prices rose 0.2 percent in July after having fallen 0.1
percent in June.
</P>
<P>
   GM SAYS STRIKE COST $1.65 BILLION
</P>
<P>
   General Motors estimated the third-quarter production losses as
a result of work stoppages from labor strikes in Flint, Mich., cost
it $1.65 billion after taxes, the company said in a federal
securities filing. The total includes a loss of $1.3 billion for
GM's North American operations and another $350 million for GM's
Delphi Automotive Systems unit.

SOX CELEBRATE THIS BASH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Red Sox and Twins resumed bashing the ball Friday
night, turning Updike's lyric little bandox in the Back Bay into
the big league version of a roadside batting cage.
</P>
<P>
   Drop a dollar's worth of quarters into the machine, cock bat,
swing for downtown.
</P>
<P>
   When the quarters finally ran out at Fenway Park, it was the Sox
who were left standing, their bats running red hot after a wild
13-12 triumph over Minnesota that was decided on Donnie Sadler's
two-run single in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Sadler, who went 3 for 4 with three RBIs, broke an 11-11 tie
when he drove in Troy O'Leary and Jason Varitek to bring the Sox
their 71st win of the season. Their 70th the night before also had
been a slugfest _ 8-7.
</P>
<P>
   This one wasn't secure until John Valentin stabbed a bouncer to
third for the final out, enabling Tom Gordon to survive a
bases-loaded situation for his 34th save.
</P>
<P>
   A sellout crowd of 32,888 saw Sox starter Tim Wakefield fall
into a 6-0 deficit in the top of the third inning, a lead that was
erased in the bottom of the third when the Sox sent 10 batters to
the plate, eventually tying it on Mike Stanley's two-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   Before it was over, the Sox lost leads of 8-6 and 9-8. They
moved to an 11-9 lead in the bottom of the fifth when Damon Buford
launched a two-run triple, but the Twins tied it again, 11-11, in
the top of the seventh on a two-run double by Paul Molitor.
</P>
<P>
   The Twins began to light up Wakefield in the second when Todd
Walker hit a leadoff bomb on a 3-0 pitch and Ron Coomer followed
suit with a deep threat on a 2-0 offering. Twins, 2-0. Coomer's was
a mammoth shot, rattling off the Coke bottles halfway up the
left-field light stanchion.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota added four runs in the third.
</P>
<P>
   The rally began with Otis Nixon's leadoff single to center, the
best-hit pitch of the inning. After Paul Molitor rolled out, Matt
Lawton hit a roller to Mo Vaughn that was labeled out No. 2. But
Wakefield, covering first on the play, dropped Vaughn's soft toss,
leaving runners at first and third. The fun continued.
</P>
<P>
   Marty Cordova followed with an infield single, a roller hit too
deep in the hole for shortstop Nomar Garciaparra to cover and throw
in time. Nixon came across with the 3-0 lead, and runners were
parked at first and second. Next, Todd Walker lifted a lazy fly to
short left, an innocent shot that took one hop into the left-field
boxes for a ground-rule double, bringing across Lawton with the 4-0
lead. Coomer slapped a ball to Valentin at third, forcing a throw
to the plate to cut down Cordova. The ball was there in plenty of
time, but catcher Jason Varitek forgot to catch the ball. Twins,
5-0, and counting. The next hitter, David Ortiz, watched a 1-1
pitch squib through Varitek's glove for a passed ball, and in
trotted Walker with the 6-0 lead. Gruesome.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom of the inning saw the Sox fire up their bats, chasing
Twins starter Dan Serafini in the process.
</P>
<P>
   The first run came across when Sadler followed a Varitek double
with a sharp single to left. A Darren Lewis double to right put
runners at second and third, and a Valentin walk loaded the bases
for Vaughn. The Hit Dog launched a Wall double, bringing across
Sadler and Lewis and halving the Twins' lead to 6-3. Garciaparra
sliced another run off the lead with a sacrifice fly to center
before Stanley smoked a 3-1 pitch over the Wall to tie it, 6-6.
Goodbye, Serafini.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox kept up the offensive pressure in the fourth, taking
their first lead of the night. Sadler's one-out single and Ortiz's
boot of a Lewis roller to first left runners at first and third.
Valentin delivered a soaring, Wall-scraping triple for an 8-6 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The pitch-by-pitch carnage continued in the next half-inning
when Wakefield was cashiered in a hail of hits, including a Coomer
single, an Ortiz single, and a Terry Steinbach homer into the
screen.
</P>
<P>
   In the bottom of the fifth, the hits just kept on coming and the
Sox again moved out in front, 11-9. The rally began with a Stanley
walk. O'Leary lashed the ball past Ortiz and it screamed into foul
territory. The ball was in play, but a member of the Fenway grounds
crew, a young fellow stationed on a chair just beyond the tarpaulin
at the face of the box seats, gobbled it up like a true Gold
Glover. He then threw into the stands, thinking the ball had been
foul. Wrong. O'Leary was parked at second with a ground-rule double
(he likely wouldn't have had more), and Stanely moved to third.
Buford then sent a triple that bounced off the Sox bullpen and put
them ahead, 10-9.

MARKET-OVERVIEW-2, 8-14 -- Selda Chender, an interior designer,
avoids stocks: ``I lost too much'' decades ago, she says. Gurus and
analysts aplenty contend that something has changed. That reality
is finally throwing its wet blanket onto a market long fueled by

CIA ALMOST BUNGLED INTELLIGENCE COUP WITH IRAQI REFUGEE 
</HEADLINE>
   (with IRAQ-NUKE)  
 (bl)  
 By JUDITH MILLER and JAMES RISEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Dr. Khidhir Abdul Abas Hamza, one of Iraq's top nuclear
scientists, defected in 1994, he expected the United States to
welcome him with open arms. But U.S. intelligence officials had no
idea who he was.
</P>
<P>
   Hamza's flight from Iraq, recounted by Iraqi opposition figures
and former and current U.S. officials, was potentially an
intelligence coup for the United States that almost turned into an
intelligence bonanza for the Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi.
</P>
<P>
   According to U.S. intelligence officials and Iraqi dissident
leaders familiar with Hamza's case, he fled Baghdad in September
1994 by hiring a smuggler to get him to the Kurdish haven in
northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   There he sought out Ahmed Chalabi, a fellow graduate of the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology who at the time was working
with the CIA as head of the Iraqi National Congress, a U.S.-backed
opposition group. After Chalabi put Hamza in touch with the CIA,
the scientist was astonished and furious to learn that the agency
was not interested in helping him defect to the United States,
Chalabi said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   A former U.S. intelligence official who was involved in the
CIA's initial negotiations with Hamza now acknowledges that the
agency erred in its initial handling of the Iraqi scientist.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did strange things in this case,'' said Warren Marik, then
an official in the CIA's Iraq group. ``We acted too quickly on this
guy and brushed him off too quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Marik arranged for a CIA scientist and another official at the
agency's headquarters in Langley, Va., to talk by satellite
telephone with Hamza to determine whether he was credible.
</P>
<P>
   But the telephone negotiations quickly broke down. The CIA
officials wanted Hamza to provide sensitive information to them
immediately over the phone, while he insisted that he would only
talk after the agency had arranged for his defection to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We dickered back and forth for 45 minutes, and the agency
dismissed him,'' Marik. ``But it's not supposed to be done by phone
like that. We were two days short of what it really takes to
determine a defector's value.''
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated and eager to find a safer haven, Hamza fled first to
Turkey. He then landed a job in another country with nuclear
ambitions, Libya. Teaching physics at Alzawiya University, Hamza
says, he was approached to work in Libya's fledgling nuclear
program, but refused.
</P>
<P>
   President Saddam Hussein finally caught up with him in 1995,
when the Iraqi secret police sent Hamza's eldest son to Tripoli,
urging him to return to his nuclear job in Baghdad. His son said
Iraqi agents had tried to kill him twice, underscoring the
consequences of refusing the invitation to return.
</P>
<P>
   His son had arrived just after The Sunday Times of London had
reported that Hamza was presumed to have been kidnapped and
assassinated by Iraqi agents in Greece.
</P>
<P>
   The tale was an elaborate fabrication. But Hamza said the
article and a third attempt on his son's life had prompted him to
leave Libya.
</P>
<P>
   Hamza fled to Tunisia and then to Hungary, intelligence
officials said. From there, he made contact with Chalabi and an
official with another Iraqi dissident group, the Iraqi National
Accord, which had connections to both U.S. and British
intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he arranged to meet with the CIA's station chief at the
U.S. Embassy in Budapest, Hungary, and was soon on his way to
Washington, intelligence officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the officials said, the spy agency arranged to pluck
his family out of his home in downtown Baghdad. Another smuggler
brought his family into northern Iraq, where a CIA team met them.
They are now reunited with Hamza in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But Hamza's life is still far from ordinary. He now works for a
Washington-based research center run by David Albright, a leading
U.S. expert on Iraq's nuclear program and will publish an article
Monday about his experiences in Iraq in the Bulletin of Atomic
Scientists.
</P>
<P>
   But he remains frustrated that his immigration status in the
United States has not been resolved and that he has yet to receive
a green card permitting him to travel and establish a permanent
legal residency in his newly adopted country. He is still
classified as a refugee, said Dawn Lurie, his immigration lawyer in
Washington.

TRAINER BYRNE HOPES TO TOUCH ON GOLDEN YEAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For his next trick, Pat Byrne plans to turn Touch
Gold into a Horse of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   Which sounds preposterous. Touch Gold began his 4-year-old
season in late June, has a single allowance-level victory and just
$42,000 in earnings to show for it, and will face his first major
competition of the year in the $1 million Pacific Classic at Del
Mar this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   But Byrne is the England-born, Kentucky-based trainer whose
careful management kept Favorite Trick undefeated in eight starts
in 1997 and helped that colt become the first 2-year-old since
Secretariat to be named Horse of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   So when he says Touch Gold's talent, combined with a well-mapped
if ambitious schedule, can produce an equally unlikely championship
in 1998, you have to listen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, we'll keep him unbeaten for the year,'' Byrne said
of Touch Gold, who was 4 for 7 last year, when he won the Belmont
Stakes, and is 1 for 1 this year.
</P>
<P>
   With perfection as the goal, no horse has as much at stake in
the Pacific Classic as Touch Gold, who will be ridden by Pat Day
when he faces defending champion Gentlemen, Puerto Madero, Free
House and five others.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Touch Gold is a magnificent animal, and I'll be
disappointed if he can't win,'' Byrne said.
</P>
<P>
   After this, the trainer said, he plans to send the son of Deputy
Minister to the Sept. 19 Woodward Stakes at Belmont Park in New
York and/or the Oct. 10 Jockey Club Gold Cup at Belmont, and the
Nov. 7 Breeders' Cup Classic at Churchill Downs in Kentucky. In the
unlikely event he keeps winning, capturing Grade I stakes on the
nation's three major thoroughbred circuits, and defeats Horse of
the Year front-runner Skip Away at least once, award voters would
have to be impressed.
</P>
<P>
   It would be an unusual route to the title for horse and trainer.
</P>
<P>
   Touch Gold was a Horse of the Year possibility for much of '97,
when he was trained in Southern California by David Hofmans. He ran
an impressive fourth in the Preakness after cracking a hoof at the
start, beat Silver Charm out of a Triple Crown in the Belmont
Stakes with the hoof patched, and won the Haskell Invitational at
Monmouth Park to look like the leading 3-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   But he wasn't the same in the Pegasus Handicap at the
Meadowlands and the Breeders' Cup Classic at Hollywood Park,
finishing last in both races, and he was put away for the winter to
let the foot heal.
</P>
<P>
   Then his owner, Frank Stronach, decided to consolidate his
stable, and sent Touch Gold and about 40 other horses to Byrne.
This was Byrne's reward for a breakthrough season in which he won
37 percent of his races, became the fourth trainer to saddle two
winners on a Breeders' Cup card, and was second to Bob Baffert in
controversial voting for the trainers' Eclipse Award.
</P>
<P>
   To sign a five-year contract as Stronach's private trainer,
Byrne, 42, gave up Favorite Trick, the Horse of the Year and
champion 2-year-old, and Countess Diana, the champion 2-year-old
filly.
</P>
<P>
   The deal seems to be paying off for Stronach and Byrne. They
have Touch Gold, recent Whitney Handicap winner Awesome Again and
the 4-year-old filly Relaxing Rhythm among the top 25 in Daily
Racing Form rankings.
</P>
<P>
   But Touch Gold was off the chart for half the year before
returning to action with a swift, nearly gate-to-wire mile victory
at Churchill Downs on June 28. To Byrne, the long absence shouldn't
disqualify his colt from Horse of the Year contention.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't stay in the stall because he was hiding from
anybody,'' Byrne said. ``He stayed in the stall because of a foot
injury.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pacific Classic won't be an easy first step in the
championship campaign. Touch Gold's single, one-turn mile might be
insufficient preparation for the 1\-mile race. He would be the
first out-of-state horse to win the eight-year-old event.
</P>
<P>
   But Richard Mandella, who trains the favored entry of Gentlemen
and Puerto Madero, thinks Touch Gold is the one to fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't call him a wild card. I'd call him a great
threat,'' Mandella said.
</P>
<P>
   Byrne obviously agrees.

<P>
   HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam _ The most talked-about construction
project in this city of soaring cranes and clattering jackhammers
is a building that has come down, not gone up. It is the old U.S.
Embassy, which until July stood in the heart of the former Saigon
as a brooding reminder of America's presence here during the
Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the State Department decided to demolish the embassy
to make way for a new consulate. A week ago, barely two months
after the building went under the wrecking ball, a Vietnamese
construction crew was carting out the last truckloads of rubble,
leaving a mossy wall topped with barbed wire and squat gun towers
as the only remnants of the once formidable compound.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials in Vietnam are eager to consign the old embassy
and all it represents to history. They talk excitedly about the
more modest consulate that is going up next to the ruins.
</P>
<P>
   The newly appointed consul general, Charles Ray, said he hoped
that the first U.S. diplomatic mission here in 23 years would
promote robust commercial ties with Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ``The war is behind us physically, and we have to put it behind
us emotionally,'' said Ray, who served two tours as an Army officer
here before becoming a diplomat. ``We really need to close that
door and move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the memories linger. And the demolition of the embassy
has stirred deeply ambivalent feelings among many Americans who
live here. While some said they were relieved to be rid of a daily
reminder of defeat, others said they regretted losing a piece of
history.
</P>
<P>
   For all the talk about the new relationship between the United
States and Vietnam _ one based on joint ventures rather than jungle
warfare _ the war still casts a long shadow.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people have regrets,'' said Frederick Burke, a lawyer
with the Chicago-based firm of Baker &AMP; McKenzie who works in a
gleaming new office tower that overlooks the embassy grounds. ``It
was a landmark, perhaps an ignominious one, because it represented
our last step out of here.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the United States finally gave up its long struggle in
Vietnam on April 30, 1975, when a military helicopter evacuated
Ambassador Graham Martin from the roof of the embassy, hours before
Communist troops captured Saigon. In the preceding days, Marine
guards fended off frantic crowds who were swarming the gates,
begging for a way out of the besieged capital.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the chaotic retreat, the embassy had come to
symbolize the turning tide in Vietnam. Built in 1967, it was
stormed and partly occupied by the Vietcong during the Tet
offensive in early 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Several months ago, in a gesture that offended some Americans
here, the Vietnamese government erected a red-stone memorial to the
Communist heroes of that offensive on the sidewalk outside the main
gate.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years the embassy became a minor tourist attraction
for Americans. Tour buses pulled up in front of the building so
passengers could gaze at the familiar honeycomb concrete walls and
rooftop helicopter pad. Although the Vietnamese had turned it into
offices for the state oil company, they allowed the building to
fall into disrepair, which lent it just the right aura of decay.
</P>
<P>
   Tourists were not the only people who were fascinated. After the
United States and Vietnam exchanged ambassadors last year and the
United States reclaimed the building, visiting U.S. lawmakers began
asking for tours.
</P>
<P>
   That bothered the new U.S. ambassador, Pete Peterson. A former
Navy pilot who was shot down by the North Vietnamese and spent more
than six years in Hanoi as a prisoner of war, Peterson has little
patience for trips down memory lane.
</P>
<P>
   He also worried that someone might be injured roaming the halls
or clambering out onto the helicopter pad. ``The building was a
dangerous, unsafe edifice that had no future use,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As if to confirm his fears, two Vietnamese construction workers
were killed in June during the demolition when they stepped onto
the roof of an elevator moments before its cables were severed. The
men plunged several floors to their deaths, adding to the litany of
misery associated with the building.
</P>
<P>
   Symbolism aside, Peterson said he also wanted to tear down the
embassy because he viewed the site as a potential source of cash.
The compound is in the middle of what is fast becoming the most
prestigious business district in Ho Chi Minh City. The State
Department is mulling plans to build an office tower next to the
consulate, which it could lease to private tenants.
</P>
<P>
   Such an arrangement would help the State Department, which faces
potentially huge costs to upgrade security at its installations
around the world in the wake of bombing attacks on the U.S.
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   Washington has classified the Ho Chi Minh City consulate as a
temporary facility. That means it does not require heavy
fortification, which will keep the projected cost under $3 million.
After last week, though, such a shoestring approach might run into
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Replacing the bunker-like embassy with a sleek tower rented out
to lawyers, bankers and accountants may be as good a symbol as any
of the new era in U.S.-Vietnamese relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It fits in with both the American and Vietnamese spirit of
consumerism,'' said Peter Sheridan, a Vietnam veteran who is now a
business consultant here. ``I say put up a high-rise and make some
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Those sentiments were echoed by several Vietnamese who strolled
past the compound on a recent morning. Though some had vivid
memories of the building from childhood, few expressed sadness
about its demolition, so long as the United States was committed to
investing in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's there to be upset about?'' asked Bui Nguyen, 27, a
teacher, who waited for a friend near the front gate. ``Everybody
can make mistakes. If it's in the past, why don't we forget about
it and build something new?''
</P>
<P>
   Ngoc Luong, 50, said: ``The relationship between the United
States and Vietnam is different now. We are doing trade, not
fighting a war.''
</P>
<P>
   Luong, who was trained as a stonemason, was loitering around the
site in the hope of getting hired as a laborer. ``I can demolish
things too,'' he said with a broad smile.

   (NYT22) DOVER, N.H. -- Aug. 14, 1998 -- CLINTON-NH-VOICES-2,
8-14 -- Many New Hampshire residents are tired of hearing that
Clinton may have had sexual contact with Monica Lewinsky.
``Ultimately, I think it's a travesty that people don't have better
things to do with this country than to investigate whether the
president is sleeping with obviously more-than-willing partners,''
says construction laborer David Pierce, center. ``How about let's
talk about something really important - the New York Yankees!''

RELIGIOUS GROUPS CAMPAIGN TO STOP GLOBAL WARMING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Ind., Mich., Neb., Ohio, W.Va.)  (js) 
 By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The political debate on global warming, long
dominated by arguments over science and economics, is spilling over
into pulpits and pews as religious organizations speak out about
morality, faith and the Kyoto Protocol.
</P>
<P>
   Major church groups in the United States are mounting an
unusually broad and active campaign to persuade the Senate to
approve the protocol, an international agreement to fight climate
change that was negotiated in Japan last year, leaders of the
effort say.
</P>
<P>
   Many Protestant, Greek Orthodox and Jewish groups, including
black churches and some evangelicals, have joined the campaign,
although Roman Catholic bishops are still considering their stance
on global warming and some of the nation's more conservative
Christian groups, like the Southern Baptist Convention, are not
participating.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to President Clinton and the senators, 22 member
churches of the National Council of Churches pledged to work for
approval of the Kyoto Protocol, calling it ``an important move
toward protecting God's children and God's creation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kyoto treaty calls on developed countries to deeply cut
emissions of heat-trapping gases like the carbon dioxide that comes
from burning fossil fuels, with the United States reducing 1990
levels by 7 percent over the next 10 to 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Joan Brown Campbell, the council's general secretary,
said the group wanted the climate issue to be ``a litmus test for
the faith community.'' She said the churches would demand that the
United States lead the way on fighting global warming without
requiring actions by the developing world, a condition the Senate
has already set.
</P>
<P>
   And in an unusual grass-roots campaign, an interfaith coalition,
the National Religious Partnership for the Environment, plans to
have clergy and lay lobbyists focus on senators from nine states
that stretch from Appalachia across the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   The targeted states include West Virginia and Michigan, where
the coal and auto industries are powerful opponents of the treaty.
Some of the region's senators, such as Republicans Richard Lugar of
Indiana and Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, are considered especially
influential in the climate debate.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign on climate issues reflects a determination among
churches in the past decade to involve the faithful more directly
in such matters as the disproportionate effects of pollution on
poor people or the need to save endangered species.
</P>
<P>
   In October, the churches will bring together about 100 people in
Columbus, Ohio, to coordinate the advocacy work in congregations
across the region, organizers say.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is two parts ground swell and one part mobilization,''
said Paul Gorman, the executive director of the religious
partnership. ``This is really about the future of religious life
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Kim Winchell of Freeland, Mich., a medical lab technician who
coordinates about 32 Lutheran congregations in the state on
environmental issues, said, ``I plan to network, network, network
and pray a lot.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Susan Harlow of Indianapolis, a seminarian who works with youth
groups through the Church of Christ, said she was called to
environmental causes during a course in prophetic ministry, which
she defined as ``speaking the hard truth, speaking out on issues
that people would rather not deal with.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Christopher Bender of the Assumption Greek Orthodox
Church in Morgantown, W.Va., said his efforts on climate change
``really have a long way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the fact that we live in West Virginia, the first step
is just to get the subject on the table,'' Bender said. ``Perhaps
over the course of time we can also change hearts and minds.''
</P>
<P>
   When Pope John Paul II delivered his message, ``The Ecological
Crisis'' in 1989, he said that industrial nations cannot demand
that the third world set restrictive environmental standards
without doing so first themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Like other religious leaders, Catholic officials said they
viewed global warming as a moral issue with profound importance for
the world's poor, who stand to suffer most from disruptions to the
climate.
</P>
<P>
   But they said it would take time for American bishops to
consider where they stand on the treaty's specifics. Two committees
are considering the issue.
</P>
<P>
   John Carr, secretary of the department of social development at
the U.S. Catholic Conference, said that the bishops ``understand
there is a lot at stake here, and want to think our way through
this.''
</P>
<P>
   At times, the convergence of religion and environmentalism has
cast secular environmentalists and believers in unfamiliar roles.
</P>
<P>
   At a conference last year in Santa Barbara, Calif., it was hard
to say which was more notable: the pronouncement by Ecumenical
Patriarch Bartholomew, the Eastern Orthodox Christian leader, that
polluting was a sin, or the public apology by Carl Pope, the
executive director of the Sierra Club, for the rejection of
religion by his generation of environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
   Some participants said they expected resistance to the injection
of morality into the climate debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe that there is a consensus in the country that
it is a moral issue,'' said Mark Jacobs, director of the Coalition
on the Environment and Jewish Life. The coalition, which brings
together 26 national Jewish organizations spanning the spectrum
from Reform to Orthodox, is participating in the campaign. ``Many
people don't believe we have an obligation to curtail our lifestyle
to protect future generations,'' Jacobs said.
</P>
<P>
   The discussion in religious circles on global warming can be
just as complex as the parallel debates in economic and scientific
circles.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is considerable debate in the scientific community on
the whole issue of global warming, enough to learn that working
scientists are not monolithic on the question,'' said William
Merrell, a spokesman for the Southern Baptist Convention. ``The
convention itself has not taken a position, and in view of the
unsettled science, it seems unlikely that we will take such a
position.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Association of Evangelicals also has largely stayed
away from environmental issues, although it is planning a
conference to discuss them next March.

QUARTERBACK FOX MOVES TO TIGHT END
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC quarterback John Fox started nine games last
season. But perhaps sensing the mood of training camp, he has
decided to play tight end this season.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, who threw for 1,940 yards and 12 touchdowns last season,
informed USC coach Paul Hackett on Thursday night that he wanted to
make the switch. The change was so sudden that Fox had still not
informed his family by Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett asked Fox to sleep on his decision, but the junior was
adamant that he wanted to make a permanent position change.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's decision was no doubt spurred by the diminishing role he
has played in training camp. After losing the No.1 job to sophomore
Mike Van Raaphorst last spring, Fox appeared to be falling further
down the depth chart with the emergence of true freshman Carson
Palmer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been so frustrated for a long time,'' Fox said. ``It's a
decision I had to make. I'll never play quarterback again. It's not
my race anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was given a fair chance to compete for the starting
position, Fox said, ``I don't know if I should comment on that.''
</P>
<P>
   What about the small number of snaps he took in practice this
week?
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't count that low,'' Fox said. ``Of course (it affected
my decision). Not being able to get out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox said he never pondered being anything other than the No.1
quarterback. As it became clear he would not win the job, he became
frustrated.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not the position I wanted to be in,'' Fox said. ``It
unsettled my soul that I was in that position.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said he and Fox spoke for about an hour Thursday night.
Hackett said he provided few answers for Fox because he has not
decided who the No.2 quarterback will be, although Palmer clearly
seems to be the leading candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not ready to make a decision,'' Hackett said. ``I tried to
tell (the quarterbacks) I would make a decision. But I wasn't ready
yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Fox) just did what he felt was best for the football team.
This was not a guy making a knee-jerk reaction.''
</P>
<P>
   The departure of Fox leaves Van Raaphorst, Palmer, junior Quincy
Woods and freshman Jason Thomas at quarterback. The entire group
has two college starts among them, both by Van Raaphorst last
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called the NCAA in Kansas City and checked. We now have the
youngest and most inexperienced quarterback corps in the United
States,'' Hackett joked.
</P>
<P>
   The decision also removed an interesting dilemma for the
Trojans, if Van Raaphorst were injured in the season opener against
Purdue. Would they use a true freshman (Palmer) or be better served
by playing it safe and going with the veteran Fox?
</P>
<P>
   It might be a moot point, although Fox wavered slightly about
ever returning to quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't go back. That's not my position any more,'' Fox said.
He then paused, and added, ``If the team needed it, I would do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox didn't just surprise the coaches, he also surprised his
fellow quarterbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``John made a pretty gutsy decision,'' Palmer said. ``I hope he
can help the team out. I feel good about the shot the coach has
given me.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Raaphorst, who sat out Friday afternoon's practice after
suffering a groin pull, was caught off guard by Fox's announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a big person,'' Van Raaphorst said. ``I know he's been in
the spotlight, and the toughest thing for him was not the change
but talking about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox had an inconsistent sophomore year and was often bothered by
a nagging ankle injury. He lost the starting position to Van
Raaphorst in the eighth game but started the final two games after
Van Raaphorst suffered a season-ending ankle injury.

<P>
   DOVER, N.H. _ Beneath the glass gaze of a great stuffed elk
head, Bill Clinton delivered an extraordinary oration here in the
winter of 1992 that historians will probably end up calling his
``Last Dog'' speech.
</P>
<P>
   His primary campaign badly wounded by allegations that he had
cheated on his wife and questions about his draft record, Clinton
defied speculation that he would have to drop out and instead,
vowed that he would persevere until ``the last dog dies.''
</P>
<P>
   Within days, New Hampshire residents rewarded his perseverance
with a second-place showing in their first-in-the-nation primary,
enough to keep his candidacy alive.
</P>
<P>
   This week, in that very same Elks hall, with Clinton facing the
most personally perilous moment of his presidency as he prepares to
testify before a grand jury Monday, New Hampshire residents voiced
yet another chorus of defiant indifference to allegations against
him _ and a wish that it would all, finally, go away.
</P>
<P>
   Pausing for emphasis, Bob Carroll, an auctioneer at an antiques
auction being held at the club, declared, ``Leave. The poor man.
Alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked later about his expectations of the president, in view of
reports that Clinton may say he had some sexual contact with Monica
Lewinsky, Carroll said, ``I think he should speak to the people _ I
think he should say he had this sexual encounter and it's between
he and his wife, not he and the world.'' And that should be that,
Carroll said.
</P>
<P>
   Such sentiments were often repeated among two dozen people
interviewed in the Elks bar, at the auction and around the
375-year-old community of Dover, and they appear to reflect broad
swaths of national public opinion as well.
</P>
<P>
   In a CBS News poll conducted between Tuesday and Thursday this
week among 1,579 adults, two-thirds of respondents said they
thought the charges against Clinton involved private matters that
did not affect his job as president. The poll, however, also found
rising sentiment in favor of an apology from the president if it
turns out that he lied under oath or instructed Ms. Lewinsky, the
former intern with whom he is accused of having an affair, to lie.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what Clinton should do if the charges against him are
true, 44 percent said he should apologize, up from 35 percent at
the end of July. Seventeen percent said he should resign, 13
percent called for impeachment proceedings, and 22 percent said the
matter should just be dropped.
</P>
<P>
   In general, 50 percent of respondents said they thought Clinton
should address the public after he testifies, against 41 percent
who thought he should not.
</P>
<P>
   In Dover, among Democrats and Republicans, Clinton fans and
foes, the broadest consensus seemed to concern an overwhelming
desire for this whole surreal episode in the history of the U.S.
presidency to end, the sooner the better. Some said they thought
Clinton should admit his affair with Ms. Lewinsky, if he had one;
others said he should stonewall; almost all said, in effect,
``Enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Certain phrases came up repeatedly: ``Between him and his
wife,'' and ``laughing stock of the world,'' and ``Skeletons in the
closet'' (as in, everyone has a few, especially sexual ones).
</P>
<P>
   And one theme, no matter how open-ended the question asked,
seemed to predominate: resentment about the price of the
investigation, both in terms of money and its absorption of public
attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's terrible for our nation and I truly think it's
not doing us any good around the world,'' said Inez DiMambro, a
68-year-old housewife and mother who was browsing among exquisite
dolls about to be auctioned off.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband is a Republican,'' added Ms. DiMambro, who votes as
an independent, ``and he's concerned, too, because he doesn't think
this is of great value to our nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, 68 percent of respondents in the CBS Poll sad that
whatever Clinton has done, the country would have been better off
without any investigation at all. A full half of Republicans
interviewed agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Such common antipathy for the process under way does not appear
to translate into agreement on whom to blame, however. Polls have
found that more people tend to blame the investigation or political
enemies for damaging the presidency than blame Clinton himself, but
there are still those like Ms. DiMambro's doll-shopping companion,
Diane King, who noted, ``He's the president. He should act more
presidential.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ms. King also expressed concern about the continuing effect the
White House scandal seems to be having on the country's moral
tenor, including the gutter-level discussions it prompts.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I heard the words ``O.S.'' once, I think I heard it 95
times and I really don't think it's necessary,'' she said,
referring to oral sex.
</P>
<P>
   Dover residents' responses also indicated just how pervasive
discussions of the scandal have become, from a high school student
who said her history class had compared Clinton's alleged
infidelities to those of Franklin D. Roosevelt, to Barrows' mention
of how the investigation is being used as an example in a criminal
justice class he has been taking in college.
</P>
<P>
   If the discussions of the investigation often float off into
salacious levity, it is partly because of a widespread belief that,
ultimately, the repercussions of all this will not be serious for
Clinton or for the presidency. There may be whispers about
impeachment proceedings on Capital Hill, but the prospect seems
incredible this far from Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the whole thing is going to be dropped,'' said George
Younger, a retired court bailiff and chagrinned Republican. ``The
Republicans do not want to see him impeached, because if he is,
Gore will have two years to solidify the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   For all their professed indignation at the attention paid the
scandal, Elks at the bar also found themselves discussing it for
the pure lurid fun of it.
</P>
<P>
   For all the humor, however, a sense of serious unease remained.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, said construction laborer David Pierce, ``I think
it's a travesty that people don't have better things to do with
this country than to investigate whether the president is sleeping
with obviously more-than-willing partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``How about let's talk about something really important _ the
New York Yankees!'' he said.

RIGHTISTS IN FRANCE SPLIT OVER EXTREMISTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js)

<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ France's conservatives, defeated last year by Prime
Minister Lionel Jospin's Socialists, are reeling again after the
party's latest decision and the reaction it provoked.
</P>
<P>
   The party decided on Thursday to admit as a member Jacques
Blanc, president of the assembly for the Languedoc-Roussillon
region, who had accepted support from the extreme right to keep his
post.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Gilles de Robien, former leader of a conservative
umbrella group that supported Jospin's predecessor, Alain Juppe,
snipped his plastic Liberal Democracy party card on a France 3
television broadcast. ``I have nothing more to do with this family,
which has no more republican ideals,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last March, Blanc and two other conservative regional assembly
leaders were expelled from the mainstream conservative umbrella
group _ the Union for French Democracy _ after they accepted
support from the far-right National Front to keep their posts
despite conservative losses to the Socialists and other leftist
parties in regional elections.
</P>
<P>
   The National Front has called for returning millions of
immigrants to their countries of origin.

EARLY AD CAMPAIGNS BY GOP HOPEFULS  
 DEMOCRATS GET A BREAK IN MARYLAND

   Early Ad Campaigns By GOP Hopefuls
</P>
<P>
   Folks in Iowa and New Hampshire have long been accustomed to
presidential candidates, actual and potential, showing up to
campaign for the next election before the dust has settled from the
election just past.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, the appearances are for making small talk and dinner
speeches, or maybe to endorse candidates in local elections. There
is little, if any, actual mention of the next presidential contest,
but everybody knows and understands the game that is being played,
even if game time is still the better part of four years off.
</P>
<P>
   Now White House wannabes are beginning to advance the starting
time of their television, radio and newspaper advertising
campaigns. Again, there is a bit of a game involved, since the
advertisements tend to push a bill or issue before Congress rather
than the presidential aspirant and since they are usually paid for
by the aspirant's political action committee.
</P>
<P>
   But, again, everybody knows and understands the game,
particularly the part about using PACs and other cover
organizations to promote ideas and issues that are really
ideological stalking horses for wannabes.
</P>
<P>
   It used to be that the first advertisements started showing up
about a year before the first caucuses and primaries. For the 2000
election, however, the first advertisements showed up in 1997, a
good three years before the election, when magazine magnate Steve
Forbes ran some radio commercials in Iowa, New Hampshire, Arizona
and elsewhere that promoted a tax reform measure before Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Tax reform was Forbes' major issue when he sought the Republican
nomination in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Sen. John Ashcroft, R-Mo., began running radio and
newspaper advertisements in Iowa that call for tax cuts to help
working families.
</P>
<P>
   The advertisements, which cost $26,500, were paid for by
American Values, the Ashcroft political action committee, and
closed with an invitation to Iowans to come out and meet the
senator as he tours the state. There is no mention in the
advertisements of Ashcroft's White House aspirations, but the
promotion of family values is a mainstay of the Ashcroft
presidential pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be outdone on the family issue, tax reform or political
advertising, another Republican aspirant, former Tennessee Gov.
Lamar Alexander, will begin a $200,000 television advertising
campaign Monday, initially concentrating on places like Iowa and
New Hampshire but eventually ``going up,'' as campaign managers put
it, in more than a dozen other states. The ads are being paid for
by We the Parents, a PAC recently set up by Alexander.
</P>
<P>
   Does any of this matter this early?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the next round of presidential preference polls from
Iowa will tell. For measuring purposes, in the last round of
polling Forbes ran a strong second with Republican voters, behind
Texas Gov. George W. Bush, while Alexander and Ashcroft hardly
registered any support at all.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats Get A Break in Maryland
</P>
<P>
   Almost two-thirds of the nation's governors are Republicans _ 32
out of 50 _ and Democratic hopes for reducing that heavy
preponderance in this year's elections have never been high.
</P>
<P>
   Political experts say the Republican tide that swept through so
many states in recent years is still running high, and they rate 7
of the 11 Democratic governorships up for grabs in the fall as
``vulnerable'' to a Republican takeover.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most vulnerable is in Maryland, where the current
Democratic incumbent, Parris Glendening, squeaked into office in
1994 with just a hair over 50 percent of the vote. And he has been
struggling ever since, dogged by disputes over gambling laws and
money for schools, stadiums and pensions.
</P>
<P>
   But the other day he got a break.
</P>
<P>
   His main challenger in the Sept. 15 primary, Eileen Rehrmann,
the chief executive officer of Harford County, northeast of
Baltimore, dropped out of the race, citing a lack of campaign
money.
</P>
<P>
   The importance of her retreat lies not in the threat she posed
to Governor Glendening's renomination, since she was well behind
him in the polls. Rather, her departure means that he will not have
to spend the next month fending off increasingly pointed,
party-dividing attacks by her and her two most politically powerful
supporters, Baltimore Mayor Kurt Schmoke and Prince George's County
Executive Wayne Curry.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he will be able to focus his campaign energies on his
presumed Republican opponent in the fall, Ellen Sauerbrey, a former
state legislator who also was his general election opponent in
1994. Polls indicate a second Glendening-Sauerbrey contest _ she
espouses a conservative brand of Republicanism while he is a
moderate Democrat _ could be every bit as close as the first.
</P>
<P>
   This seems especially likely if Ms. Rehrmann, Schmoke and Curry
do not heed the governor's call for unity. Thus far they have have
been silent on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Schmoke and Curry, who are black, that silence
means that Glendening may not be able to count on piling up big
vote margins in heavily black and heavily Democratic Baltimore and
Prince George's County.
</P>
<P>
   Idaho Congress Race May Be 1996 Redux  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Going into the 1996 election, Democrats figured they had a good
shot at unseating Rep. Helen Chenoweth of Boise. They said she was
too conservative even for Idaho's heavily Republican and heavily
conservative 1st Congressional District, which stretches the length
of the western side of the state.
</P>
<P>
   They were wrong. But not by much.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of a major money infusion from the League of
Conservation Voters and the AFL-CIO, Democratic candidate Dan
Williams, a former congressional aide, came within 6,500 votes of
beating Ms. Chenoweth.
</P>
<P>
   Now, two years later, Democrats still think Ms. Chenoweth is
vulnerable. And they still believe that Williams can exploit that
vulnerability and help the Democrats regain control of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Party officials in Washington promise assistance. So does big
labor. And once again, the League of Conservation Voters has Ms.
Chenoweth on its list of candidates who pose what they believe is a
``dirty'' threat to the environment.
</P>
<P>
   As in 1996, the league has hired a full-time political worker to
assist Williams. The league has also pledged to contribute at least
$200,000 to the Williams campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But overtaking Ms. Chenoweth will probably be no easier this
time around than two years ago. She is pretty good at fund-raising
herself and can depend on assistance from the national Republican
Party.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, she has lowered her hard-right profile a bit over the
last couple of years, thereby undercutting some of Williams' major
argument for turning her out of office.

NYC MAYOR ACTS TO WITHDRAW METHADONE FROM ADDICTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RACHEL L. SWARNS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Following through on his promise to overhaul drug
treatment in New York City, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has decided that
heroin addicts treated at city hospitals will generally be allowed
to get methadone for no more than three months, city health
officials Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The policy change, which will take place in about 60 days, will
affect 2,000 addicts who take methadone, a synthetic drug that has
been widely prescribed to blunt heroin cravings for the last 30
years. Under the new plan, addicts enrolled in programs at five
city hospitals will be weaned from methadone within three months,
instead of taking it indefinitely as they do now. The programs will
continue to offer intensive counseling and other services after
that time.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor has argued that methadone maintenance programs simply
substitute one dependency for another, and that abstinence from
drugs is a more moral and decent approach to curing addiction.
</P>
<P>
   In preparation for the shift, city officials suspended
admissions this week to the methadone programs at Bellevue, Harlem
Hospital, Metropolitan Hospital, Elmhurst and Kings County. The
hospitals, which each typically receive about four new patients
weekly, began referring those clients to other private and
state-run clinics, city officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The decision immediately created a furor in the drug-treatment
community, where methadone treatment has been embraced by the
National Institutes of Health; Gen. Barry McCaffrey, the White
House drug policy chief, and state drug rehabilitation officials.
</P>
<P>
   While city officials control less than 10 percent of the 36,000
methadone treatment slots in New York City, state health officials
said the policy shift could create a shortage of desperately needed
slots. The city's methadone treatment system is already operating
at more than 90 percent of capacity, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   State officials, who provide some of the financing for the city
programs, said they also feared for the health and well-being of
the heroin addicts forced to make the new transition. About 1,000
methadone-to-abstinence slots already exist in New York City, but
``historically, it has not worked for everybody,'' said Wendy
Gibson, the spokesperson for the State Office of Alcoholism and
Substance Abuse.
</P>
<P>
   State officials said they wanted to review the city's plan, but
Dr. Luis Marcos, president of the city's Health and Hospitals
Corp., said the city had the authority to make the decision on its
own.
</P>
<P>
   Marcos said the new policy will liberate heroin addicts from
their dependency on methadone, moving them to abstinence, very much
like alcoholics. ``We would like to be able to free many of these
men and women who are life-dependent on this drug, which is a
synthetic painkiller very similar to heroin,'' Marcos said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``The expectation for the alcoholic is to be abstinent and the
expectation for the heroin addict should have the same goal. I
believe that society has been rather lax in terms of dealing with
heroin addicts. It's very easy and inexpensive to give a pill of
methadone for life to people. But the time has come to liberate
these addicts from that kind of expectation.''
</P>
<P>
   Marcos said heroin addicts receiving treatment at city hospitals
would also be required to work as part of their recovery program,
which is a plan widely supported by most drug treatment experts.
Hospital officials have already begun to evaluate the 2,000
methadone maintenance patients to assess their needs.
</P>
<P>
   City officials said they were also re-evaluating methadone
treatment for the 4,300 inmates at city jails. And Marcos said he
expected some consternation among drug treatment officials as the
city moves to dismantle a treatment regimen that has been widely
considered the best hope for heroin addicts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know change is not easy, and their reaction is the normal
expected reaction of people who are being challenged to do things
differently,'' Marcos said. ``No matter what the change is, people
react with fear and concern. But it is time to re-evaluate. We're
going to do it.''

EDITORIAL: CANADA'S NOBLE GIFT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.M., Utah)   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Aug. 15:
</P>
<P>
   Canada's decision last week to give the Nisga'a Indians control
of their ancient tribal lands in British Columbia was an overdue
but honorable gesture, born partly of guilt for past injustices and
partly from a belief that tribal sovereignty will lead to economic
self-sufficiency.
</P>
<P>
   But the government in Ottawa must make sure its trust is not
abused. In particular, it must hold the tribe to national laws,
especially those protecting the environment, even if that limits
what the Indians hope to do.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. experience with Indian sovereignty might be helpful to
the Canadians, who in fact have come rather late to the idea _ more
than two centuries behind the United States, which granted
self-government to 371 separate tribes between 1778 and 1871. The
treaties struck between Congress and the tribes gave the Indians
tribal homelands and freedom from state control. But they remained
subordinate to the will of Congress, becoming, in effect, nations
within a nation, levying their own taxes and enforcing their own
laws but always subject to a higher power.
</P>
<P>
   This is essentially the same arrangement that the Canadian
government has struck with the Nisga'a tribe. The tribe will be
encouraged to engage in forestry, mining, fishing and other
activities to sustain its independence. At the same time it will be
asked to obey national laws, including strict environmental
regulations _ a vital point since the land to which the Nisga'a
will be taking title, with its extensive pine forests and pristine
streams, is not only visually stunning but also ecologically
fragile.
</P>
<P>
   But this ``nation-within-a-nation'' architecture, however clean
it looks on paper, has not prevented conflicts in the United States
between tribes and local and state interests. Some of these
conflicts involve money _ whether, for example, non-Indians who run
businesses on reservations should pay taxes to the tribe or to the
state. Many disputes involve the environment.
</P>
<P>
   In New Mexico, for example, the Isleta Pueblo tribe forced the
city of Albuquerque to spend $300 million to clean up a nearby
river. A federal court ruled that the Indians were well within
their rights under the federal Clean Water Act. Conversely, the
Goshutes, a tribe in central Utah, decided last year to lease part
of their reservation as a storage ground for high-level civilian
nuclear waste. The Goshutes said they were simply invoking their
sovereign powers to make themselves self-sufficient. Their
neighbors, quite rightly, were horrified.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, this dispute will have to be resolved by the
authorities in Washington, which is just where it ought to be
settled. As the senior partner in the treaties, the federal
government must juggle two obligations. One is to protect tribal
interests, the other to assert the national interest when tribes
overreach.
</P>
<P>
   So will it be in Canada, where neighbors of the Nisga'a in
British Columbia are already complaining that the deal gives the
tribe unfair advantages. Having made the gift of sovereignty,
Ottawa must now control its consequences.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ A four-month labor dispute at eight Jewish cemeteries
in Queens, Brooklyn and Long Island has left hundreds of mourners
unable to dedicate gravestones of relatives and friends, as Jewish
custom dictates, because monument-company workers refuse to cross
the picket lines of cemetery workers.
</P>
<P>
   Replacement workers at cemeteries have buried the dead and
maintained the grounds since early April, when workers went on
strike at one cemetery and were locked out by owners at seven
others. But hardly a monument has been erected since then, and
mourners say they have been robbed of the chance to put at least a
ceremonial end to their grief.
</P>
<P>
   Jewish custom calls for burial within 24 hours, and for the
ceremonial unveiling of a graveside monument in a year, to close
the traditional period of mourning.
</P>
<P>
   Lenore Edelman said her brother, Samuel, died so unexpectedly in
April 1997 that she was barely able to organize a funeral service
for him at Mount Hebron/Cedar Grove Cemetery in Flushing, Queens.
So she had hoped to schedule a more elaborate ceremony on the first
anniversary of his death. But the stone bearing her brother's name
has not budged from the factory where it was carved.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was bad enough that the funeral was one-two-three, because
it was such a shock when he died,'' Ms. Edelman said. ``We hoped to
have an unveiling where we could let people know. I die every week
when I call the man at the monument company and find out we still
can't schedule it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds like Ms. Edelman have had to put their grief on hold
while labor negotiations continue. For now, the new graves bear
only temporary markers of metal or wood. Some graves in family
plots have no markers at all. And even if the monuments were
delivered, they could not be installed, since there is no one to
pour the concrete foundations.
</P>
<P>
   David Schenck, a vice president of sales at Sprung Monument Co.,
which has nine branch offices in the metropolitan region, said that
more than 500 monuments were piled up in his factory because of the
labor dispute. He said his workers, who are members of an
International Brotherhood of Teamsters local, have refused to cross
the picket line, but he added that he also feared that stones would
be vandalized if they were placed before a settlement was reached.
</P>
<P>
   Workers at Mount Lebanon Cemetery in Glendale, Queens _ one of
eight Jewish cemeteries in Queens and Brooklyn and on Long Island
that make up the Cemetery Employer Association of Greater New York
_ went on strike on April 7, when contract negotiations dissolved.
The next day, the owners of the seven other cemeteries locked out
their workers in sympathy with Mount Lebanon. More than 340
gravediggers and groundskeepers at the eight cemeteries had worked
without a contract since January 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute centers on reductions in pension and medical
benefits for the workers, who make between $18 and $20 an hour.
Both sides said this week that they had reached agreement on those
issues, but now were divided on how to deal with five workers who
were dismissed while on the picket line.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Goldberg, a business representative with Local 74 of the
Service Employees International Union, which represents the
cemetery workers, said that the owners had refused to allow the
dismissals to go to arbitration, and that the union would not
concede unless the dismissed workers were given some type of
appeal. ``We just want to get everybody back to work and start the
healing process,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Hass, president of the cemetery association, said more
than 1,400 burials had been performed since early April, ``every
one of them on time, with dignity and decorum.'' He added that
after a two- or three-week period during which grounds went
untended, scores of replacement workers have kept the grass mowed
and the weeds in check.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``It's been very frustrating because we have continued to
service the Jewish community, and we maintained our original
position to try to keep costs down, and yet we're still
characterized as the villains,'' Hass said.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Lelonek, a manager at Memorials by Riverside, a monument
company in Manhattan, said he fielded dozens of calls every week
from relatives desperate to get a monument dedicated and unveiled.
``It's really a shame, because a lot of people feel very unsettled
right now,'' he said.

COMMENTARY: A SALESMAN WHO PAID ATTENTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DAVID GONZALEZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Zara Grauer still remembers her first date with
Howard Bardach. He stepped aside to let her board a bus, then sat
beside her and suggested they share some coffee and conversation.
Walking home afterward, he asked her not to walk so fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't you feel well?'' she replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he said. ``I want it to last longer.''
</P>
<P>
   Such sentimentality. It figured, since he fancied himself a
ladies' man. Such salesmanship, too, since he was just as likely to
approach strangers on the street and ask if they wanted to buy or
sell his roach-killing paint, hand warmers or special light bulbs
whose rays rivaled ``sunshine on a June day.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who got beyond the product pitch would learn that Bardach,
80, had once been a Yale man, a Navy man and the owner of a
packaging business. They were also told that he had moved to the
Hell's Kitchen neighborhood after one of his sons committed suicide
and his wife divorced him. Despite those setbacks, he reinvented
himself, convinced that riches still waited for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came to this neighborhood to get away from it all,'' said
Sylvie Pappis, a friend. ``And he did.''
</P>
<P>
   Too much so. Starting about a year ago, he grew thin and quiet.
He stopped writing the wacky, hyperkinetic letters hawking his
products and solutions to the world's ills. He stopped being a
salesman. On July 27, he hanged himself. His death seemed as
impenetrable as the successes and sorrows of his very life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's face it,'' said Roger Starr, a former city official who
worked on the Yale Literary Magazine with him and received his
bizarre letters over the years, ``there's sort of a gap between
being eccentric and being insane. I'm not sure what side of that
gap he fell on.''
</P>
<P>
   His letters and phone calls would make you think he was on the
wrong side. What kind of person would call a reporter at 4 a.m. and
urgently insist that he leave his ink-stained cocoon to embrace the
world of wealth by selling those special light bulbs?
</P>
<P>
   Then again, John Waldo Adams, his best friend, knew him as the
only person who ever threw him a birthday party in his 90 years on
this earth. The two met around 20 years ago when Bardach stopped
him on the street and tried to sell him a chemical with amazing
gunk-removal powers. When he discovered that Adams was a poet, he
volunteered to type his writings, offering free editorial advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted me to get more fun and laughter into my poems,''
Adams said. ``I was writing about the condition of the world, the
economy, the psychological, the sociological. Sometimes he said it
was too serious.''
</P>
<P>
   He often stopped by Ms. Pappis' hat shop on West 54th Street,
sometimes with lady friends as possible customers. ``He had a good
eye for colors,'' she said. ``He was always attentive. He wasn't
like a lot of men who pass by the store and don't notice. He paid
attention.''
</P>
<P>
   She suspected something was amiss last year, when he would walk
past the store with only a nod. Some of his friends said he had
cancer, though he would never talk about what was going on. He
always had lunch at a nearby senior center, but the people there
knew even less.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he was a tortured soul,'' said Sharon Beard, who works
at the center. ``But he carried himself without a scintilla of
self-pity. He was a classy man.''
</P>
<P>
   While his friends in Hell's Kitchen wondered what was wrong, Ms.
Grauer explained simply that he had had an epiphany about a year
ago when she fell ill. He took care of her, she said, and grew
caring and calmer. But she suspected that he was disappointed by
his fizzled business plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it must have been difficult when the Yale magazine
would arrive and he saw this one was a CEO and that one had a home
in Montauk, and he hadn't accomplished,'' she said. ``That's what
got to him.''
</P>
<P>
   That didn't matter to the dreamers and buddies who met him
during his last years. They recalled a man whose hard life never
diminished the fast talk. To them, he was Howie Bardach, salesman
and friend. They only wish he had let them in a little closer a
little longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was essentially a salesman,'' Ms. Grauer said. ``It was
like `Death of a Salesman,' when the wife said, `Attention must be
paid.' I always thought of that because I did pay attention. The
first time we sat on the couch, I put a pillow behind him. I don't
think anybody had ever done that for him before.''

</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Leave it to Mike Tyson to rewrite a script. An armada of news
media was prepared to descend on Trenton, N.J., Friday morning for
Tyson's latest moment of truth: the day he would find out whether
his privilege to box would be restored by the New Jersey State
Athletic Control Board.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, after a year, the shame would be over. Tyson hasn't
fought since June 1997 after Nevada officials revoked his license
and fined him $3 million for biting the ears of Evander Holyfield
during a heavyweight championship bout in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   But on Thursday, the day before the decision on his boxing
license in New Jersey would be rendered, Tyson's camp withdrew the
application and almost immediately applied for a license in Nevada.
It was another bizarre turn in the life of an athlete who has
become a living American soap opera.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986 Tyson, 20, became the youngest heavyweight champion in
history. In 1992 he was convicted of rape. He served three years in
an Indiana prison and was released in March 1995. The fight with
Holyfield was his opportunity to fulfill a legacy, a claim to
greatness.
</P>
<P>
   At one point in his career, Tyson stood ready to be ranked among
the most terrifying, if not the greatest, fighters of all time. Now
Tyson is a pathology moving from venue to venue.
</P>
<P>
   This latest attempt at a shortcut is a microcosm of Tyson's
dance pattern _ two steps up, one step back. He should have applied
for his license in Nevada in the first place. But someone in his
camp felt the Nevada State Athletic Commission would refuse to
grant the appeal.
</P>
<P>
   So, Plan B, which was not Tyson's idea, another adviser said,
was hatched. They would apply in New Jersey. That move angered
Nevada regulators, who saw it as a way to circumvent a recently
passed federal boxing law, the Professional Boxing Safety Act of
1997. It requires all states to honor suspensions in other states.
</P>
<P>
   Luther Mack, a member of the Nevada board, called Tyson's move
to New Jersey ``a slap in our face.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Arum, the president of Top Rank, who has been involved in
boxing promotions for nearly 30 years, said: ``My supposition was
that they had every assurance in the world that they were going to
get a license in New Jersey. They miscalculated because they didn't
realize the political storm that would ensue.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson's sidestep drew a scathing rebuke from New Jersey
political figures and from Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who has been
calling for reforms in boxing and who was a co-sponsor of the
Professional Boxing Safety Act.
</P>
<P>
   But even with all the high-powered opposition, the end run
around Nevada nearly worked. During his hearing before the New
Jersey commission 20 days ago, Tyson was the model of civility as
several character witnesses spoke before the panel for more than
three and a half hours.
</P>
<P>
   But then he snapped. The corporate-political arena conditions
cause most of us to hide our anger, resentment, fear and loathing
behind a mask. Tyson doesn't wear that mask well. This, in fact, is
part of his appeal. He is who and what he is. Not far beneath the
surface lies the rage of the puncher, the brawler who loses his
temper whether the goal is near or not.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson is no Pollyanna. Everyone knows it, and now the New Jersey
State Athletic Control Board knows it. Following a 45-minute
questioning by Michael Haas, an assistant attorney general, Tyson
became angry, and in remarks to the panel he uttered an expletive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue is control,'' Arum said. ``You or I, if we're before
a commission, we shut our mouths because we want to get them to
give us a license. We act like normal people, not because we're
moralistic; we hold it in, because we have control.''
</P>
<P>
   But the issue, at Tyson's hearing and with Tyson in general, is
how much punishment is enough. Is a yearlong suspension from
boxing, a $3 million fine and an estimated $50 million in lost
earnings enough?
</P>
<P>
   Enough, already. Pitchers throw at batters, hockey players
slash, football players intentionally try to maim. Tyson snapped
one night and bit.
</P>
<P>
   This is the nature of his appeal. These mercurial changes _ the
sudden rewriting of scripts, unpredictable behavior _ count more
than his victories or losses. His life is the attraction. Arum said
Tyson is boxing's version of ``The Truman Show.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything he does is in a glass bowl,'' Arum said, ``and
people are fascinated. He can have seven fights in a row and lose
every single fight, and still do a good pay-per-view because people
are fascinated by the Tyson story.''

THE CHASE IS ON AS MONTGOMERIE AND SINGH SOAR  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDMOND, Wash. _ With so many contenders, and so many
possibilities, the stage has been set for a memorable weekend at
the PGA Championship.
</P>
<P>
   Some of golf's biggest names emerged from the woods of Sahalee
Country Club on Friday, putting themselves in the thick of a
wide-open hunt for the year's final major championship. Either
Vijay Singh or Colin Montgomerie could put the icing on their solid
careers by winning that elusive first major championship. Tiger
Woods and Steve Elkington remained in position to add another major
to their collection. Davis Love III, the defending champion, lurked
near the lead with a chance to become the first person to win
back-to-back PGA titles since Denny Shute in 1937. And while Love
and Mark O'Meara were among those who were near the lead,
dark-horse contenders like Steve Stricker, Scott Gump and Andrew
Magee are in position to pull an upset victory.
</P>
<P>
   Forming the prelude to a pressure-packed weekend, Singh shot a
four-under-par 66 Friday to take the clubhouse lead at four under
par (136) with several contenders still on the course during the
second-round. Tying the course-record 66 that Woods set on
Thursday, Singh was one stroke ahead of Montgomerie, who shot a 67
Friday, and Gump, who shot a 69. Stricker was still on the course
at three under through 17 holes.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there was an impressive logjam at two under that
included Woods, Elkington, Magee and Brad Faxon _ all in position
to make a weekend move. And O'Meara, trying to become the first man
since Ben Hogan to win three majors in the same year, was at one
under par after Friday's 70.
</P>
<P>
   So while Singh liked where he stood, he knew that next 36 holes
would be perhaps the most demanding of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``You try not to have a different mind-set, but the pressure is
going to make you do that,'' he said. ``I've played a lot of
weekends going into the lead, or close to the lead, but this is
something different.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, it was sure to be exciting. The race to glory on Sunday
became even more wide open when players like Singh, Stricker and
Montgomerie made moves, and Woods did not. Starting the day with a
two-stroke lead at four under par, Woods struggled to a
two-over-par 72 Friday, and he was happy to score that well.
</P>
<P>
   Woods never found a consistent rhythm all day, feeling
uncomfortable with his swing and leaving himself few opportunities
for birdies. A subpar round would have allowed Woods to keep his
lead. But he was pleased that he prevented an average round from
becoming a disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very pleased to shoot 72 with the way I hit the ball,''
Woods said after a round that included three bogeys and just one
birdie. ``I'm only two back. That's perfect, that's where you need
to be. I'm very pleased with the way I scored, but not happy with
the way I hit the ball. I didn't have a feel for my swing.''
</P>
<P>
   Singh had a feel for his swing, playing to his strengths _
length and accuracy with his tee shots and irons. Tight courses
like Sahalee suit Singh's game, and he showed that early Friday,
making birdies on three of the first four holes to build early
confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key is to hit a lot of fairways here,'' said Singh, a
35-year-old native of Fiji, who has won five times on the PGA Tour,
with four top-10 finishes this year. ``I'm putting well. I have a
good feel for the greens. I think the key was the start of my
round. That gave me confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Singh made a four-foot putt for birdie on No. 1, a 40-foot putt
for birdie on No. 2, a 12-foot putt for birdie on No. 4, a 20-foot
putt for birdie on No. 5, and a 4-foot putt for birdie on the par-3
No. 9, after hitting a beautiful 5-iron shot off the tee.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Singh was in sole possession of the lead at five
under par, but he made his first bogey on the par-5 No. 11 when he
got into trouble after a bad tee shot.
</P>
<P>
   Singh followed with a birdie on No. 13, but he bogeyed the par-3
No. 17, when he hit his tee shot into a bunker, then failed to get
up and down for par. While Singh badly wants to win a first major,
so does Montgomerie, one of the world's top players, who has grown
tired of answering questions about not winning major championships.
</P>
<P>
   Nine of the last 10 winners of the PGA have ben first-time major
winners. Montgomerie would love to continue that trend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good about my score and my position,'' said
Montgomerie, a 35-year-old native of Scotland, who has been the
leading money-winner on the European Tour for the last five years.
``I haven't come over here to finish second. If I can putt anything
like I have the past two days, I have an opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Gump, a 32-year-old who lives outside of Orlando,
Fla., may have been the least known of the contenders, but he was
thrilled to be in contention.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm playing well, the pressure won't bother me,'' said
Gump. ``If I'm playing poorly, I'm frustrated. Having a putt to
make or miss the cut is not much fun. But playing well is
enjoyable. And to be in this position is fun.''

SUSPECTS ARE NOT LISTED IN WILL OF WOMAN WHO DISAPPEARED 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The will of an Upper East Side millionaire who has
been missing for more than six weeks does not list the lead
suspects in her disappearance as beneficiaries, officials involved
in the case said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers for the suspects, Sante Kimes and her son,
Kenneth, hailed the will as evidence that the Kimeses, who are
being held in New York on credit card fraud charges, were not
involved in the disappearance of Irene Silverman, 82.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have said that they suspect that the Kimeses were
planning to defraud Mrs. Silverman out of her East 65th Street
mansion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The will clearly shows that the Kimeses had absolutely no
motive to cause the demise of Mrs. Silverman,'' said Mel Sachs, Ms.
Kimes' lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clearly shown by the fact that the will would not in any
way benefit the Kimeses,'' Sachs added.
</P>
<P>
   John Sare, the lawyer handling Mrs. Silverman's will, said he
would not comment on whom the will lists as beneficiaries. But he
said his law firm had begun the lengthy process of having Mrs.
Silverman legally considered a missing person. A person must be
missing for at least three years, according to state law, before he
or she is declared legally dead and the will can be executed, Sare
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The person has to be missing for three years without being
heard of,'' he said. ``Only when there is a declaration of death
would it be possible'' to execute the will.
</P>
<P>
   Sare said a copy of Mrs. Silverman's will was filed in
Surrogate's Court in Manhattan on July 13. The following day, he
said, Judge Renee Roth named the Bank of New York to oversee the
maintenance of Mrs. Silverman's town house and other property.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Justice Jeffrey Atlas of state Supreme Court
in Manhattan denied a request for bail for the Kimeses on the
credit card fraud charges. Sachs and Jose Muniz, Kimes' lawyer,
were appealing a decision by Judge Herbert Adlerberg last week to
deny the mother and son bail. Prosecutors charged the Kimeses with
using a Florida man's MasterCard to buy drinks and dinner at the
Pierre Hotel, as well as items from a Chanel boutique.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the Kimeses said they would appeal Atlas' ruling.

WOMEN SMASH YET ANOTHER BARRIER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Calif.)  (lb) 
 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Over the last decade or so, a woman's serving as a bishop has
become less remarkable among some Protestant denominations, as the
office has been opened to female clerics in the United Methodist
Church, the Episcopal Church and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in
America.
</P>
<P>
   But that hardly means there are not still firsts. One occurred
earlier this week when the Rev. Kay Ward, a seminary professor,
became the first woman to be elected bishop by Moravians, members
of a Protestant tradition with autonomous church provinces around
the world.
</P>
<P>
   What also made the election, in the Northern Province of the
Moravian Church in America, a distinctive event is the unusual way
Moravians choose bishops: Elections take place without caucuses,
campaigns for office or even candidates.
</P>
<P>
   When the province's synod, its top policy-making body, meets
every four years, blank ballots are handed out to several hundred
delegates, and everyone writes down the name of someone he or she
thinks would make a good bishop. After the first ballot, the names
of those who got votes are announced, and the balloting continues
until someone gets a two-thirds majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably representative of a mind-set in our denomination
that if somebody wants the job, that's probably the wrong person
for the job,'' said Hermann Weinlick, editor of The Moravian, a
church magazine in Bethlehem, Pa. The process, he said, is ``kind
of juxtaposed against'' secular society, in which ambition for
office is often rewarded.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ward, director of continuing education at Moravian
Theological Seminary in Bethlehem, said modestly that her election
as bishop was ``a small part'' of a larger story about women's
attaining leadership roles in her church.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pretty amazed,'' said Ms. Ward, who is also a professor
of pastoral theology. ``There are no words for this, and I'm a big
talker.''
</P>
<P>
   Moravians call themselves the first Protestants, tracing their
roots back to before the Reformation, to Jan Hus, a Czech reformer
who proclaimed Scripture to be an authority superior to church
tradition and hierarchy. He was eventually condemned as a heretic
and burned at the stake in 1415.
</P>
<P>
   A half-century later, his followers formed the Unity of the
Brotherhood (considered by Moravians a forerunner of the present
church) and began ordaining ministers. Over the years, Moravians
have become known for their music and hymns, their widespread
missionary work and a focus on ecumenism.
</P>
<P>
   Lately they have been growing outside Europe and North America.
Of the more than 730,000 Moravians in 19 provinces worldwide, about
40 percent live in Tanzania. ``It's the fastest-growing area of the
church,'' Weinlick said.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the church's North American presence is small, with
29,000 members in the Northern Province, scattered among 13 states
and two Canadian provinces. (There is also a Southern Province,
with about 20,000 members, based in Winston-Salem, N.C.)
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ward, 56, holds a doctorate from the Claremont School of
Theology in California, is married to a Moravian pastor and has
four adult children. She will be consecrated as a bishop on Nov. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Her role will be that of spiritual leader, without the
administrative duties that also occupy bishops in other churches. A
Moravian bishop serves as a pastor to the church's pastors.
</P>
<P>
   Bishops also ordain deacons and consecrate presbyters, the
Moravians' two, essentially identical orders of ministry. And, Ms.
Ward said, they ``really are charged with praying for the church
and for individuals.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the process by which bishops are elected, Weinlick said
it was intended to produce someone from the church's mainstream, a
person known as a good listener and speaker, who can relate to
different people.
</P>
<P>
   At the six-day synod that ended on Tuesday in Bethlehem, Ms.
Ward won on the third ballot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the quickness with which they reached the
decision,'' Weinlick said, ``we felt it was a consensus and what
we'd say is God's will.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that he thought the time for this had come, given that
the province began ordaining women to the clergy in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   In her acceptance speech, Ms. Ward asked for delegates' prayers
and said, ``We never know what will happen when we respond to God's
call.''
</P>
<P>
   She also said the path to her election began long ago, when
church leaders opened the way for women to become pastors and
administrators.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never know what will happen when men, clearly led by God's
inclusive spirit, choose to break open tightly bound fists full of
power and authority,'' she said in the speech. ``And so I
understand that what is happening here today takes place in a much
wider context, a much longer journey.''

APPLEBY DOES HIS BEST AMID TRYING CONDITIONS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDMOND, Wash. _ An emotionally trying tournament for Stuart
Appleby ended Friday when he missed the cut with a 36-hole total of
150, 10 over par. Appleby was competing for the first time since
the death of his wife, Renay, who was killed last month after being
struck by a car. Understandably, Appleby found it hard to
concentrate. But he took an important step by returning to
competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today was easier than yesterday,'' said Appleby, a 27-year-old
Australian. ``I'm looking at this process as not an instant thing.
The most frustrating thing is that I'm out here playing, and I'm
not 100 percent prepared. But under the circumstances, there is no
other option.''
</P>
<P>
   Appleby received warm applause from the gallery on every hole,
and he finished strongly, making birdies on the final two holes.
With this tournament behind him, Appleby hopes to play better in
next week's Sprint International, followed by the NEC World Series
of Golf in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to look at the next two events as stepping stones,''
said Appleby. ``This tournament is like a warmup for what's coming.
I have to deal with a lot of issues, and one of them is golf.
Hopefully, it will get a little easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Local Favorite Has It Rough
</P>
<P>
   It was another frustrating day for Fred Couples, a crowd
favorite who grew up in nearby Seattle. Couples shot a 71 Friday,
after shooting a 74 on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only frustrating that I didn't practice a lot harder
before I got up here,'' Couples said. ``If you play very little,
you are not going to play well, and that's a proven fact. The
hardest thing for me was the way I played. I don't think there was
any more pressure. It seemed like yesterday, every time I was in
the rough, I was a couple of feet in the rough. Today was a little
better, but I missed a lot of shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his difficulties, Couples was still thrilled to see a
major played in the Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sahalee is a great course,'' said Couples. ``Seattle has put
on a great show. I am always proud of Seattle. Coming back was a
real treat.''
</P>
<P>
   Frost Likes His Chances
</P>
<P>
   David Frost's best career finish in a major is a tie for fifth
at the 1995 Masters, and he has never finished higher than 10th at
a PGA Championship. Yet, after shooting a 69 Friday to move to one
under par for the tournament, Frost liked his chances this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is definitely a course I can win on,'' he said. ``It is the
type of course where nobody has an advantage. The long hitters
don't have an advantage over the shorter guys. I think it's
anybody's game.''
</P>
<P>
   Frost, who is 38, has 10 career victories on the PGA Tour, but
it will be interesting to see how he responds to being in weekend
contention at a major.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played with a lot of patience the past two days,'' he said.
``There weren't too many birdies out there for me, but a lot of
pars. It's funny how it works. The more you play for a par, the
more a birdie jumps in the way.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Paul Maslin, a former real estate executive in
Manhattan and the Bronx, died on Thursday in Goose Bay, Labrador,
while returning to New York from a vacation that included a visit
to the North Pole. Maslin, a resident of Roslyn, N.Y., and Fort
Lauderdale, Fla., was 82.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was an apparent stroke, said his daughter,
Janet Maslin, who is the chief film critic for The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   With a cousin, Seymour Moslin, and an uncle, Solomon Moslin,
Maslin began Paul Maslin &AMP; Co. in 1948, and built it into a concern
with 70 properties.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1970s, the company bought Nehring Brothers and
Herbert Charles, two Manhattan-based real estate companies. The
partnership sold both those operations in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Maslin is survived by his wife, Lucille, of Roslyn and Fort
Lauderdale; his daughter, Janet, of Pocantico Hills, N.Y.; and two
grandsons.

 By JAMES BENNET   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ ``The president would like to speak to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of old friends, academics, legislators, political
analysts and governors have picked up the telephone in the last six
years and heard some version of those spine-straightening words, as
Bill Clinton ricocheted from one crisis to another, from one
freighted political choice to the next.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to sleep and insatiable for information, he was punching
through his cocoon of White House aides for a reality check or a
street-level glimpse of the public, to insure that he assessed
every possibility.
</P>
<P>
   But the president is not leaning on White House operators _ or
operatives _ in preparing for the most portentous day of his
turbulent career, his aides say. Faced with questioning under oath
on Monday about his private life, with impeachment proceedings
tuning up in the wings, Clinton has almost no one he can turn to
for advice, say his friends and current and former advisers.
</P>
<P>
   No one besides a few lawyers has enough information about the
president's legal predicament to give him political counsel worth a
phone call. If others learned the facts, they could be compelled to
share them with the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   The question, in the view of the president's allies, is whether
the enforced silence matters _ whether Clinton, his ultimate and
most trusted strategist, can make the right decisions in this
cliffhanger without examining every line of approach first. ``In so
many ways, this guy is being asked to act contrary to his own
instincts,'' one former White House official said.
</P>
<P>
   A private man despite his glad-handing reputation, Clinton may
acknowledge to 23 grand jurors that he had an intimate relationship
with Monica Lewinsky, some of his closest advisers say. A cautious
politician, he may take an extraordinary gamble, describing his
testimony in an address to the nation.
</P>
<P>
   At a White House renowned for fierce response to any accusation,
damage control has, eerily, taken a holiday. The president's
advisers, uncertain of the truth, have not fanned out on television
to defend him. Some, unneeded now and anxious to project a
relaxation-as-usual image, have simply left town on long-planned
trips.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore has vanished to Hawaii for two weeks.
Erskine Bowles, the White House chief of staff, is golfing in
Scotland; his deputy, John Podesta, who has run the political
damage control effort for seven months, only returned from vacation
on Friday. Lanny Breuer, a senior member of the White House
counsel's office, has gone fishing. Bruce Lindsey, the president's
closest aide, is recuperating from back surgery, and is rarely at
the office.
</P>
<P>
   But the president's wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, canceled her
vacation to stay at his side, and Chelsea Clinton, on break from
Stanford University, has stayed at the White House as well. ``His
bulwark of support, his wall of protection on this, has been
Hillary and Chelsea,'' said the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who has met
periodically with Clinton since the first thunderclap of Lewinsky
accusations in January.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said he is careful about how detailed their
conversations become, for fear of Kenneth Starr, the independent
prosecutor. ``We talk, and when we talk we have prayer, but I have
carefully stayed away from the legal area in this, because Starr's
been so bizarre in his hauling people before his grand jury,''
Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has seemed at times weary and muted recently. But if the
president feels isolated or pressured, he is not revealing it to
some close friends or to his senior aides. Riding in his limousine
in Los Angeles on Tuesday, Clinton indulged in a favorite pastime,
a game of hearts played during a running, bantering conversation.
After the president won a hand, one adviser, who had been been
asked by reporters whether Clinton was lonely, observed
sarcastically that his victory might improve his mood.
</P>
<P>
   The president glanced at him over his newly dealt hand. ``What
are you talking about?'' he asked, according to two of the players.
Another participant in the game replied, ``The press thinks you're
curled up by yourself depressed in the back of this limo.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Where do they get that?'' Clinton asked, with a baffled grin.

<P>
   To some of his own advisers, the president is a mystery now.
They wonder why he does not vent more anger. They wonder if he
misled the public and them as well. They wonder how he could have
risked his presidency on a relationship, whatever its nature, with
an intern. They mourn a lost year, and they wonder if he will get
his term back on track.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, they wonder what he will do on Monday. ``Any staff
member who tells you they know what he's doing,'' one official
said, ``they're lying.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has acknowledged having caused pain in his marriage, and
he has acknowledged a preference for briefs over boxer shorts. Such
admissions helped give him a reputation as a compulsive sharer of
personal details, a needy baby boomer turning the nation into his
analyst. In fact, despite his legion of friends, Clinton confides
in almost no one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't think that his personal, private, innermost
part, I don't believe he shares that with anybody, except maybe
Hillary,'' said David Leopoulos, one of Clinton's closest friends
since childhood. ``I don't even try to approach that with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Leopoulos said that he was amazed to read during the 1992
presidential campaign that Clinton's stepfather had been a heavy
drinker who sometimes turned violent. His friend never told him.
``Never a hint,'' he said, chalking the secrecy up to titanic inner
strength.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, on a visit to Little Rock, Clinton gathered with
friends dating back four decades. They played cards _ hearts, of
course _ and told stories until five in the morning; the president
described his trip to China and his hopes for democracy there. But
though his friends worried that he was going through a brutal time,
they did not discuss the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel terrible for him, but I don't think he feels terrible
for himself,'' Leopoulos said. ``He said the other night in our
card game, `I wish I could run again.'''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's history of relying on himself to handle agonizing
matters might explain his seeming equanimity now. He has never
counted heavily on any Democratic wise man to guide him. He ran
challenging his party's orthodoxy, implicitly repudiating the
judgment of predecessors and congressional Democrats. While he has
what one former aide calls ``crushes'' on advisers, he usually
discards them eventually and moves on to new ones, in a constant
search for the best counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton often leaves the impression that he agrees with whatever
argument he hears. In fact, his current and former aides say, he is
usually adopting it only to test it out. Once he feels he can argue
every side of a question, he decides, alone.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's investigation has created an odd zone of mincing
conversation around the president. He is surrounded by people who
have testified before the grand jury: the steward who brings his
fruit and diet ginger ale, the personal secretary who guards his
door. For some, the rush of reporters outside the federal
courthouse and the grilling by prosecutors were searing
experiences. Yet they do not discuss it with the man at the center
of it, White House staff members say.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, however, life proceeds as though Clinton had no
testimony planned, as though his private lawyer had not practically
moved into the White House. On Friday, Mrs. Clinton sprang an early
birthday party for her husband, who turns 52 on Wednesday. White
House staff gathered behind the Oval Office to sing and to share a
cake decorated with sugary portraits of a golf ball, an eagle,
Buddy the dog, and Socks the cat.
</P>
<P>
   As always, Clinton has been reassured by such warm receptions,
especially the embrace of crowds. As he works ropelines or moves
among guests at fund-raisers, strangers tell them they love him or
say nasty things about Starr. In his free-form remarks before
friendly crowds at fund-raisers, the president comes as close as he
ever does to giving a public glimpse of his private thinking, aides
say. He seems preoccupied now with energizing his second term.
</P>
<P>
   The president's aides were proud for a brief time to have
persuaded him to shorten his remarks in public to just ten minutes.
But in the last couple of weeks, Clinton has pushed his typical
time to more than twice that, as he urgently counsels against
apathy. He tells crowds to grab this historical period to improve
education, strengthen Social Security, and protect the environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, this is a golden moment for our country,'' the president
said at a fund-raiser here Friday, ``and the big question is what
to do with it.''

TYSON MOVES ON; NEW JERSEY LEFT WITH LACK OF CLOSURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Larry Hazzard, the New Jersey boxing commissioner, said Friday
that he would have preferred Mike Tyson to proceed with his
application for a New Jersey boxing license rather than withdraw
and apply for one in Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he would let the process go forward,'' Hazzard said.
``I would have liked for there to have been some closure to the
matter, especially after having given him the opportunity to be
heard before the commission.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson withdrew his New Jersey application on Thursday, one day
before the state Athletic Control Board was to render a decision. A
site and date has not been set for Tyson's Nevada application
request. But a hearing will take place sometime in September in Las
Vegas before the five members of Nevada's state Athletic
Commission. Three members of the commission must vote in favor of
Tyson for him to receive his license.
</P>
<P>
   The Nevada commission revoked Tyson's license on July 9, 1997,
after Tyson bit the ears of Evander Holyfield during a heavyweight
championship bout in Las Vegas on June 28, 1997. The commission
ruled that Tyson would have to wait at least a year before seeking
another license.
</P>
<P>
   Hazzard said he did not think Tyson's decision to withdraw his
application in New Jersey would have an adverse effect on the
process in Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would think that Nevada will deal with the issues on their
merit and will give Mike Tyson a fair hearing, which is what he got
here,'' Hazzard said. ``We didn't view his applying here as an end
run around the law. When your livelihood is at stake, you make a
decision to go where you feel you will be best served.''
</P>
<P>
   Hazzard said Tyson did not hurt himself with his outburst near
the close of the hearing, in which he uttered an expletive in
frustration.
</P>
<P>
   ``He testified for two hours,'' Hazzard said. ``I don't think
this board would have taken those final three minutes and make that
the deciding factor. This board would have taken all of the factors
into consideration.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who was the co-author of the
Professional Boxing Safety Act of 1997, issued a statement Friday
commending Tyson for returning to Nevada to seek reinstatement of
his license. Earlier this week the senator had rebuked Tyson for
trying to circumvent a part of the Boxing Safety Act, which calls
for states to recognize suspensions in other states.
</P>
<P>
   Because Nevada had revoked Tyson's license and not suspended it,
Tyson and his attorneys were using a loophole to get around the
law. The senator's criticism was part of the reason Tyson withdrew
his application in New Jersey, according to Jeff Wald, a Hollywood
entertainment executive who is acting as one of Tyson's advisers.

CRUCIAL MANEUVER COMPLETED IN REPAIRS AT TIMES SQUARE SITE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By MONTE WILLIAMS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Three weeks after the scaffolding collapse at the
Conde Nast building, the most critical part of the repair effort
was completed Friday. About 9:30 a.m., workers extricated an
elevator cab on the 24th floor from the twisted wreckage of the
exterior elevator tower and scaffolding and lowered it to the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   An eight-ton, 30-foot section of the elevator tower and the
scaffolding were also removed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a huge amount of concentrated weight and the most
critical stage in the dismantling of the damaged scaffolding,''
said Richard Kielar, a senior vice president of Tishman Realty and
Construction Co. and the site's construction manager. ``This is a
tremendous relief to everyone involved in the project.''
</P>
<P>
   On July 21, the collapse of a section of the 700-foot-high
scaffold sent sections of the elevator tower plunging to West 43rd
Street and through the roof of the Woodstock Hotel across the
street, killing an elderly woman. The collapse, the city's worst
construction accident in more than a decade, closed Times Square
for days and forced hundreds of people from their homes and
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The lowering of the elevator cab took three days of preparation
and involved 25 to 30 workers, Kielar said. The cab, like other
portions of scaffolding, will be taken to an undisclosed location
in Brooklyn so engineers can examine it for clues to the accident's
cause.
</P>
<P>
   There is one more critical procedure to come, Kielar said:
dismantling the scaffolding on the 21st and 20th floors, where the
upper part of the scaffolding overlaps the lower part. ``The 19th
floor is damaged, but the removal of the bottom 18 floors would be
routine,'' he said, adding that he expected all the scaffolding to
be removed by Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The stretch of 43rd Street between Avenue of the Americas and
Broadway might reopen by Thursday, Sunny Mindel, a spokeswoman for
the mayor's Office of Emergency Management, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The 274 residents evacuated from the Woodstock Hotel cannot
return yet because damage to the building is still being assessed,
Ilyse Fink, a spokeswoman for the New York City Department of
Buildings, said Friday. Scaffolding punctured the roof in four
places, pierced the 10th-floor ceiling and damaged the parapet.
Engineers are also trying to determine whether there was structural
damage.

CHALMERS WYLIE, 77, OHIO CONGRESSMAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio, Mass., Fla.)  (lh) 
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Chalmers Wylie, who represented Ohio for 26 years
in the House and helped to win approval of the federal bailout of
the savings-and-loan industry, died Friday in Columbus, Ohio. He
was 77.
</P>
<P>
   Wylie had a heart attack while waiting to have a routine eye
examination at Ohio State University Medical Center, the center
announced.
</P>
<P>
   As the ranking Republican on the House Banking Committee, Wylie
helped to tailor President Bush's plan to rescue the
savings-and-loan industry so it could gain support in the
Democratic-controlled Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Although the precise causes and costs are still in doubt, there
is widespread agreement that many members of the industry went
astray in the 1980s, an era of relaxed regulation and high-flying
finance, and plunged into risky investments outside their original
mission of providing home mortgages.
</P>
<P>
   When a deep real estate slump, undependable interest rates, hard
times in the oil industry and other factors slowed the economy, the
savings-and-loan industry was in big trouble, and since its
deposits were federally insured taxpayers were left holding the
bag. The total cost of the bailout, stretched over many years, has
been estimated into the hundreds of billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Wylie, along with a Republican ally on the Banking Committee,
Rep. Jim Leach of Iowa, helped to win initial financing for the
bailout in 1989 and renewed financing for several more years.
</P>
<P>
   Wylie was able to work with lawmakers of both parties, ``The
Almanac of American Politics'' said, because he was, basically, ``a
pleasant man.''
</P>
<P>
   He was also, by some standards, a proudly old-fashioned one. In
1984, Wylie, a Methodist, opposed giving federal money to the
Library of Congress so it could produce a Braille edition of
Playboy magazine. The magazine featured ``wanton and illicit sex,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wylie's district encompassed much of Columbus, including some of
its black population, white working-class and rural areas, and the
Ohio State neighborhood. Throughout his career, ``The Almanac of
American Politics'' said in its 1988 edition, Wylie blended
impulses that were ``standard Republican'' with political instincts
that were ``entirely practical, not theoretical.''
</P>
<P>
   Wylie was first elected to Congress in 1966, and his
re-elections were often landslide victories. His worst showing was
in 1990, when he won 59 percent of the vote against a relative
unknown.
</P>
<P>
   He strongly supported veterans' benefits, military spending and
a law against desecration of the American flag. His stands on
issues were dependably heartland Republican.
</P>
<P>
   But a scandal involving the Department of Housing and Urban
Development in the Ronald Reagan administration distressed him, and
he said so. The scandal involved former Reagan administration
officials who were paid large fees by developers seeking housing
funds from HUD.
</P>
<P>
   ``My visceral reaction is that the fees paid were not
appropriate,'' he said. Official inquiries would prove him right.
</P>
<P>
   Chalmers Wylie was born in Norwich, Ohio, on Nov. 23, 1920. He
attended Otterbein College and Ohio State and graduated from
Harvard Law School.
</P>
<P>
   Wylie enlisted in the Army in 1943 and rose to the rank of first
lieutenant, serving with the 30th Infantry Division in France,
Belgium and Germany. He was awarded a Silver Star for helping to
evacuate wounded men from a mine field under enemy fire near the
Rhine River in 1945. He was also awarded a Bronze Star, the French
Croix de Guerre and the Purple Heart, for being wounded by
artillery fire while helping to rescue wounded soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Before going to Congress, Wylie was the city attorney for
Columbus, an assistant Ohio attorney general and a member of the
state Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Just before he retired from Congress in 1992, Wylie was one of
more than 350 members who were hurt by disclosures that they had
overdrawn their accounts on numerous occasions in the House's
private bank. Although the overdrafts were simply covered by the
deposits of other members, and there was no loss of taxpayer money,
public surveys showed that many people thought erroneously that the
offending representatives had ``bounced'' checks.
</P>
<P>
   Upon his retirement, Wylie said, ``There is an ugliness in the
House now which does not appeal to me.'' He practiced law in
Columbus until his death.
</P>
<P>
   Surviving are his wife, Marjorie Ann; a son, Bradley, and a
daughter, Jacquelyn Poston, both of the Columbus area; three
sisters, Ramona Wylie and Georgia Miller, both of Columbus, and
Opal Bailey of Florida, and four grandchildren.

A MARINA THRIVES WHERE WAREHOUSES CAST SHADOWS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DAVID M. HALBFINGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Along a narrow creek that divides a sooty Bronx
industrial park from the whooshing traffic on the Hutchinson River
Parkway, where the setting sun casts shadows of warehouses and
tractor-trailers, exists a seagoing community like no other.
</P>
<P>
   There is Francois Guillet, the weather-beaten owner of this
unlikely marina, who speaks English laden with the diction of the
French Alps and dreams of retiring here. And Daniel Torrez, a
former Greenwich Village shopkeeper who has built an art studio
inside a ramshackle houseboat and arranges orchids on the foredeck.
And ``Uncle Bob,'' a disabled jail guard who eases his pain with
beer and companionship on the deck of his motorboat, the Golden
Girl.
</P>
<P>
   What unites them all is a love of the water, and a willingness
to see past their immediate surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   Where some might be put off by the speeding cars on the parkway
_ the nearest lane of traffic cannot be more than 250 feet from the
dock _ Torrez says he tunes out the noise. ``Sometimes, at night,
there's hardly anyone on the highway, and you can hear the birds,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the parkway's proximity has its advantages. Directly
opposite the marina is a rest stop, with a gas station and a
McDonald's. So boaters in need of a refill, or hungry for a
hamburger and fries, simply have to paddle a rowboat a few yards
across Westchester Creek.
</P>
<P>
   The Bronx, the only borough of New York City that is part of the
mainland United States, actually has a wealth of marinas and
boaters. In addition to the dozen or so boatyards on City Island,
there are several on Eastchester Bay near Throgs Neck, and one
hidden away on the Hudson in Riverdale.
</P>
<P>
   Guillet's 30-slip marina on Westchester Creek, Metro Marine, was
built in 1957 by the late Jerry Conroy, a retired tugboat captain,
said Guillet, who bought it from him 11 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Even at the time, the location south of Westchester Square was
an odd choice. The path of Westchester Creek was shifted slightly
in the 1930s to make way for the parkway. It might have been filled
in and paved over then, but for a fuel company that needed to
continue receiving oil shipments by barge. So the Army Corps of
Engineers dug a new path for the creek along Commerce Avenue,
Guillet said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, oil barges still inch up the waterway once a month or so,
twice a week in winter. But over time, despite the growth of an
industrial park alongside it, the creek has become more of a refuge
than a commercial artery, a sort of maritime version of the
community gardens, or casitas, that have sprouted on vacant lots in
many neighborhoods in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the marina has drawn police officers, schoolteachers
and other working people unable or unwilling to pay the rent at
more fashionable boatyards. Some are new boaters, like the criminal
lawyer who received his boat, the Bandolero, as payment from a
client, though a few have been coming here for more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Abraham Aviles, a self-employed insurance broker in the
Morrisania section of the South Bronx, comes here after work a few
days a week to go fishing for the plentiful bluefish and striped
bass to be had in Long Island Sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I come at 2 or 3 in the afternoon, depending on the
tides,'' he said. ``There's nothing better.''
</P>
<P>
   Others seem rarely to leave the dock _ like Uncle Bob (he keeps
his surname secret), a guard at a prison for the criminally insane
on Wards Island who was disabled in a fight with an inmate in 1996.
These days, his hands fall asleep if he is out at sea for more than
half an hour, he said. But he and a group of buddies show up nearly
every day to relax, grill chicken or steaks, and drink beer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anxieties is the boiling pot,'' he said. ``If you don't
release the tensions, the pot explodes. You can relieve a lot of
stress over here.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Torrez, 51, who owned a flower shop in Greenwich Village for
many years but moved to the Bronx last year while recovering from
meningitis, discovered the marina a few months ago while riding his
bicycle through the industrial park. He spotted it behind a
chain-link fence, and swooned.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I used to pass by here, I used to think it was slums,''
he said. ``I never thought I'd be living here.''
</P>
<P>
   Life at this marina, like any other, has its own rhythms. Things
are quiet most days, except for the occasional groan of a rusty
crane, circa 1945, that Guillet uses to hoist boats in and out of
the water. Around 4 or 5, the yard begins to fill with the
after-work crowd. On Saturdays and Sundays, the dock is overrun
with children and families and the air is filled with the smells of
barbecuing.
</P>
<P>
   The boaters are an eclectic bunch, but they get along, said
Torrez, the artist and orchid lover. ``We're all a puzzle, and it
fits,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Guillet, 56, says he loves his ``poor man's boat club,''
although he sometimes sounds as if he wishes his life had taken a
different turn a long time ago. Born near the French ski resort of
Albertville, he learned to sail as a boy in the mountain lakes
there. Following his brother to New York in 1963 to work as a
contractor, he bought his first boatyard, the Sunrise Marina on
Eastchester Bay, in 1968. His wife, Gail, was the marina's
secretary. They were married in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifteen years ago, boating was good,'' he said. ``It was
easier to borrow money from the bank for a boat than a car. I had a
waiting list. I had to refuse customers.''
</P>
<P>
   So Guillet bought the marina on Westchester Creek as a low-rent
option for his overflow business. But the recession of the late
1980s and early 1990s dropped the bottom out of the boating
business, he said. Today, he supplements his scant profits from the
two boatyards with his earnings as a barge captain, providing a
floating crane that is used in bridge inspections.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, he says, he will sell the Sunrise Marina. He and his wife
are making a home of an old three-story building that overlooks the
marina on Westchester Creek. Although his wife, who was raised in
the Bronx, says she has been begging to leave the borough for
years, Guillet says they will retire here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it,'' he says, his face lighting up through sweat and
filth and a full gray beard. ``I don't see a building in front of
me here. I'm not blocked in. I'm never crowded, like those people
who live in those apartment buildings, on top of each other, in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody wants to buy this,'' he added. ``There's not that much
income. It's a way of life _ like a fisherman, or a farmer. Every
boat is like a cow, you know? You pull the boats like cows.''

EDITORIAL: THE TRIBULATIONS OF AFGHANISTAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (js) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, Aug. 15:
</P>
<P>
   A medieval nation may arise from the rubble of modern war in
Afghanistan. The Taliban movement, which seeks to return
Afghanistan to the fundamentalism of its ancient villages, is
winning military victories that have brought it close to uniting
the fractious nation. Afghanistan needs a central authority and an
end to the warlordism that has terrorized its people. If the
Taliban provide it, the world will be tempted to normalize
relations with them. But the Taliban must remain isolated until
they end their own totalitarian policies.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban have promised that when the war ends they would
relax their harsh edicts, which scholars say have no basis in the
Koran. This pledge should be encouraged but not trusted. War
conditions did not cause the Taliban to bar females from education
and work, or require a close male relative to chaperone a woman
anytime she leaves home.
</P>
<P>
   A new study by Physicians for Human Rights shows these policies'
effect in Kabul, where Taliban rule is the most severe. The study
found that while men can still get decent medical care, hospitals
and wards for women lack basic equipment. Male doctors may see only
chaperoned women and may not examine their bodies. Most female
doctors have been dismissed, and women reported lying in hospital
beds for days without seeing a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   After 20 years of war, Kabul is a city of widows. The rules are
particularly hard for these women. They cannot support themselves
because they can no longer work, and even bread supplied by aid
groups must go to men. Women who go out alone risk beatings by the
religious police.
</P>
<P>
   The study underscores how little humanitarian aid reaches the
most vulnerable. The Taliban and the outside world are at odds over
the strictures the movement is placing on relief groups, which were
expelled last month for defying a Taliban order to move into an
isolated compound with no electricity or water. The United Nations
announced an agreement this week allowing the groups to return,
which does little to change Taliban rules that effectively deny
women food, health care and education.
</P>
<P>
   Other nations may now move to normalize relations with the
Taliban, and the U.N. may be inclined to award a victorious Taliban
Afghanistan's U.N. seat. Oil and gas companies are also waiting for
peace to begin building Caspian Sea pipelines through Afghanistan.
The California company Unocal is part of a consortium that will bid
on the gas pipeline, and last year it paid for part of a trip by
Taliban leaders to the United States. These financial and
diplomatic rewards should be withheld until the Taliban end their
cruel policies.

JAMES MALLEY, 86, WHO INVESTIGATED KENNEDY SLAYING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va., Kan., Mo., Texas)  (lb) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   James Roland Malley, a retired FBI division chief who played a
central role in the investigation of President John F. Kennedy's
assassination, died on Aug. 7 at his home in Alexandria, Va. He was
86.
</P>
<P>
   Malley, a 34-year veteran of the FBI, also served as president
of the Society of Former Special Agents of the FBI and as chairman
of its charitable arm, the Former Agents of the FBI Foundation. He
retired from the agency in 1971 as head of its general
investigative division with the rank of inspector.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Kansas City, Kan., he graduated from the University
of Missouri at Kansas City School of Law and joined the bureau in
1937. He worked in Missouri, New York and Texas, where he was in
charge of the Houston office.
</P>
<P>
   He was called to Washington in 1952 and assigned to the general
investigative division. When Kennedy was killed in November 1963,
Malley helped direct the FBI investigation.
</P>
<P>
   After President Lyndon B. Johnson ordered creation of the panel
popularly known as the Warren Commission for its chairman, Chief
Justice Earl Warren, Malley became the bureau's liaison to the
panel. It heard from 552 witnesses and pored over reports from 10
federal agencies involved in the investigation. The panel's report
in September 1964 pronounced Lee Harvey Oswald the lone killer.
</P>
<P>
   Accusations of a whitewash persisted, however, and in 1978
Malley was called to testify before a Select House Committee on
Assassinations, which wanted to know how federal agencies handled
themselves in the inquiry. He was asked then about the possibility
of a conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do know it was on everybody's mind,'' Malley told the panel.
``Was somebody else involved? That existed from the minute it
happened.'' He then told of the FBI's efforts to track down
possible Cuban or crime-syndicate connections, but said that no
credible evidence was found.
</P>
<P>
   Malley's survivors include his wife, Pat; a daughter, Patricia
Tighe, also of Alexandria, and two grandchildren.

STAR OF THE NIGHT, ACT 89. THIS TIME IT'S PETTITTE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The premise of competing with the rest of the
American League is lost. The Yankees challenge themselves now, each
other. Andy Pettitte tries to match Orlando Hernandez. Paul O'Neill
wars within. They all seem to be trying to play each game to
perfection.
</P>
<P>
   And the Yankees are coming as close to that regular-season
archetype as any team in this century, closer than any team since
World War II. With Pettitte pitching into the eighth inning,
Mariano Rivera coming on for another save and Chuck Knoblauch
hitting another home run Friday night, the Yankees beat the Texas
Rangers, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   More than two weeks remain in August and the Yankees are on the
verge of 90 victories: They have 89, and just 29 defeats, having
won nine consecutive games. Should they win half of their remaining
44 games, they would match the most victories in AL history, 111 by
the 1954 Cleveland Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball teams are not supposed to win like this. Some
basketball teams have, like Magic Johnson's Los Angeles Lakers and
Michael Jordan's Chicago Bulls. Football teams win like this, like
the University of Nebraska and Don Shula's Miami Dolphins. But
baseball is a team sport controlled by individuals, particularly
the pitcher; with an effective pitcher, the worst team can beat the
best team. Each day, a bad team can play well and beat a good team.
</P>
<P>
   But every day, the Yankees play great baseball; they benefit
from routine pitching excellence. Hernandez struck out 13 Rangers
and allowed two hits in eight and one-third innings on Thursday,
and afterward Manager Joe Torre addressed questions about whether
Hernandez would be part of the pitching rotation in the playoffs _
the inherent effect of that being that Pettitte might be shifted to
the bullpen. A nice friendly competition, Torre called it.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte, now 14-6, is as proud and as driven as any of the
Yankees, however, and he pitched with as much determination and
intensity Friday night as he has all year, his sinking fastball
generating one ground ball out after another, 11 in the first seven
innings.
</P>
<P>
   He seemed to be in trouble in the seventh, after walking Juan
Gonzalez to lead off the inning, with the Yankees ahead by just
3-1. Will Clark then hit a blooper to short center field. Derek
Jeter raced out from shortstop and Bernie Williams raced in from
center, the ball dropping to a space between them; Jeter reached
up, gloved the ball _ and dropped it.
</P>
<P>
   But Williams, seeing Gonzalez halfway between first and second,
picked up the ball and threw to second, where first baseman Tino
Martinez was stationed, for a forceout. Martinez was exactly where
he was supposed to be. That is why they win.
</P>
<P>
   Ivan Rodriguez followed with a single to right and Clark stopped
at second. But Pettitte rammed cut fastball after cut fastball on
the hands of Todd Zeile, who popped up, and then struck out Mike
Simms, ending the inning.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Then the Yankees finished off Aaron Sele with a two-out rally in
the bottom of the seventh. Chad Curtis singled, and for no obvious
reason, the 46,547 fans at Yankee Stadium began chanting, ``Let's
Go Yankees, Let's Go Yankees,'' loud enough to overwhelm the music
from the public address system.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Girardi singled, and the crowd noise intensified. Knoblauch,
who had hit his 16th home run in the fifth inning, dumped a single
into short center field. Curtis scored, Girardi aggressively took
third, and when the throw from Roberto Kelly went there, Knoblauch
took second _ just as he is supposed to. That is why they win.
</P>
<P>
   The noise got louder when Jeter slammed a single to right field.
Both Girardi and Knoblauch raced home, and the premise of
competition was over, for Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Among the regulars, Girardi probably is the Yankees' poorest
offensive player. He does not hit home runs, does not hit for a
high average, does not steal bases.
</P>
<P>
   But Torre loves it when Girardi bats with a runner on first,
because of his ability to put the ball in play. Scott Brosius
opened the third inning Friday night with a walk on four pitches,
Girardi strolling to the plate behind him. On Wednesday, Girardi
had broken open a game against Minnesota with a two-run double on a
hit-and-run play.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, Torre did not wait: on the very first pitch to
Girardi, he ordered a hit-and-run. Brosius broke from first base as
Sele delivered homeward, and Girardi laced a line drive over the
head of second baseman Mark McLemore, the ball splitting the
outfielders as Brosius ran until he crossed home.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees did not get any more runs in that inning, but they
added one in the fourth, when Williams homered. Knoblauch bashed
his home run with two out in the fifth, and Rivera induced a
game-ending double play from McLemore, the Yankees' third double
play of the game. That is also why they win.

GARY LISZ, 44, COSTUME DESIGNER FOR BALLET, THEATER AND MOVIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., W.Va.)  (js) 
 By JENNIFER DUNNING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Gary Lisz, a costume designer for ballet, theater and
film, died on Tuesday at St. Vincent's Hospital. He was 44 and
lived in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a heart attack, said Ken Daigle, his companion.
</P>
<P>
   Lisz was known for costumes whose easy simplicity quietly
enhanced the style and furthered the intent of a wide range of
productions. He designed costumes for six pieces choreographed by
Robert La Fosse, most of them for the New York City Ballet. He
created costumes for ballets by Peter Martins, Kevin O'Day and
George Balanchine, also at City Ballet, and for Clark Tippet and
John Selya at American Ballet Theater.
</P>
<P>
   Lisz's theater work included costumes for the Broadway
productions ``Piaf'' and ``Sophisticated Ladies'' and,
off-Broadway, ``A Couple of White Chicks Sittin' Around Talkin' ''
at the Astor Place Theater, for which he won the New York Drama
Critics Award for best costume design in 1981; Richard Nelson's
``Between East and West'' at the McCarter Playhouse in Princeton,
N.J.; Marsha Norman's ``Sarah and Abraham'' at the George Street
Playhouse in New Brunswick, N.J.; and John Kelly's ``Find My Way
Home.''
</P>
<P>
   Lisz designed the costumes for Ethan Silverman's ``Central
Park,'' screened at the Sundance Film Festival last year and on PBS
this year. His other film costuming included ``I'm Dancing as Fast
as I Can,'' one of several productions with the director Jack
Hofsiss, and the Mabou Mines Acting Company's ``Dead End Kids.'' He
designed the national tour and ABC television production of ``The
Elephant Man.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Washington, he trained at the Corcoran School of Art,
and at the Parsons School of Design in New York City. He began his
career in the fashion industry. He designed his own line for
Sportwhirl/Multifacets from 1975-79. At his death, he was a
professor of design at Parsons and the Fashion Institute of
Technology.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Daigle, Lisz is survived by his parents, Dorothy
and Leonard Lisz of Romney, W.Va.

ROBERT M. LUBY, 88, FOUNDER OF REGIONAL CAFETERIA CHAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo., Texas)  (js) 
 By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Robert M. Luby, a restaurateur who had such a down-home devotion
to quality and such an accommodating string of unemployed relatives
that he helped turn a small Texas cafeteria business into a
$500-million chain with more than 200 restaurants in 11 states,
died on Thursday at a hospital near his summer home in Colorado
Springs. He was 88 and had retired as president of Luby's
Cafeterias Inc. in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   To say that Luby grew up on cafeteria food would be something of
an understatement. Within a year after he was born in Mansfield,
Mo., in 1910, his father, Harry, an Illinois-born entrepreneur who
operated a men's clothing store in Springfield, had made a fateful
business trip to Chicago and returned fired by the possibilities of
a strange new food establishment he had encountered there.
</P>
<P>
   Copying the Chicago operation from its name to its menu he
daringly opened the New England Dairy Lunch in Springfield and
promptly discovered that people there had been hankering for
bargain-priced boiled vegetable dinners served buffet style from a
12-foot counter.
</P>
<P>
   A family operation from the beginning (Luby's mother, Julia,
planned meals and helped cook even with a toddler underfoot), the
original short-counter cafeteria was so successful that a second
one was opened in Springfield in 1912 and Luby's father embarked on
a novel path of incremental improvements.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned that patrons would resent changes, even those that
improved operations, the elder Luby began the practice of selling
one cafeteria, usually retaining a minority interest, while opening
a new, improved version in a different town. The result was the
creation of what was not so much a chain as a dotted line of a
dozen cafeterias stretching from Missouri through Oklahoma, Texas
and Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the family and the family business reached San
Antonio in 1927, Harry Luby had done well enough to retire at 39,
leaving his teen-age son with a near obsession for the business he
had grown up in.
</P>
<P>
   During his high school years Luby did every facet of cafeteria
work from serving food to washing dishes and while studying
business administration at the University of Texas in Austin he
took a couple of years off to open and operate a cafeteria in
Corpus Christi, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   After his graduation in 1934, Luby indulged in a short burst of
wanderlust, opening a cafeteria in San Francisco. The city's
Depression-era maritime union problems helped doom the business but
not before it had brought Luby two important assets, an especially
satisfied customer named Georgina Wenglein, who became his wife,
and her brother, George, who was persuaded to return to Texas with
Luby and join him in the cafeteria business.
</P>
<P>
   By 1940 Luby had opened several cafeterias in Texas, but after
the outbreak of World War II he sold out and joined the Army Air
Corps, spending his years as an intelligence officer stationed in
California and dreaming of creating a chain of cafeterias.
</P>
<P>
   Teaming up with a cousin, Charles Johnston, he founded the
modern Luby's chain in San Antonio in 1947 and began an expansion
using Wenglein and other relatives as trusted managers.
</P>
<P>
   When he ran out of relatives, Luby, recruited investor-managers
whose 40 percent share of the profits assured that they would be as
concerned about quality and efficiency as Luby was.
</P>
<P>
   Although there were several long-established cafeteria chains in
the South, where an appetite for a hearty, home-style meal that
doesn't cost an arm and a leg is not considered as declasse as it
is elsewhere, Luby's insistence on quality and attention to detail
helped assure a steady expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Initially operated as Cafeterias Inc., the company sold stock to
the public in 1973, changed its name to Luby's Cafeterias Inc. in
1981 and gained a listing on the New York Stock Exchange in 1982,
the year Luby stepped down as chairman of the board.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, as the company he founded continued to flourish and
expand (its 231 cafeterias specializing in regional favorites from
grits to tamales stretch from Arizona to Florida) Luby, who became
a multimillionaire providing low-cost food that even now averages
just above $5 a meal, devoted himself to civic work, travel,
hunting and fishing, golf _ and gourmet cooking.
</P>
<P>
   Luby, twice a widower, is survived by his wife, Kathleen; a
daughter from his first marriage, Martha Lahana of Littleton,
Colo.; a stepdaughter, Elizabeth Rogers of San Antonio; and two
stepgrandchildren.

Monty doesn't lack 
confidence, conceit
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By DALE ROBERTSON &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
REDMOND, Wash. _ We hate Monty, don't we? We hate him so much, he
had to play the last 40 holes of the U.S. Open in the company of
San Francisco's finest.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to, say, British soccer fans, golf fans are
well-behaved. Still, the Olympic galleries, having been egged on by
a talk-radio jackal, abused Colin Montgomerie so mercilessly that
they had to call in the gendarmes to keep an eye on him.
</P>
<P>
   The spirit of the Statue of Liberty notwithstanding, Montgomerie
has not been roundly welcomed on these shores. He's hardly of the
huddled-masses class, having missed few meals in his lifetime.
Colin is widely perceived to be a pompous uh, colon, and his tongue
can be frightfully acerbic.
</P>
<P>
   He's the full Monty all right _ full of Monty. He talks a better
game than he generally delivers, which is saying something because
he is a superb golfer, having been the European money leader for a
record five years running.
</P>
<P>
   And although he doesn't always play his best when it counts the
most, he has been a leading American nemesis in the past two Ryder
Cup defeats, of which he says: ``Because I got the most points, I
tend to be seen as the reason why America lost. Well, I'm sorry
they lost. But it hasn't been my fault.''
</P>
<P>
   It's those kinds of statements, albeit inarguably honest ones,
that get Monty in trouble. But the gallery swarms here haven't been
as hostile as the Bay Area's. Monty insists there have been no
unpleasantries to disrupt his ball-striking, so once again he has
played himself into contention for a major golf title, something he
never has won.
</P>
<P>
   He'll begin the final 36 holes of the PGA Championship one shot
back, trailing only Vijay Singh, the one player who might be less
liked than he is. On a day when two huge crowd favorites, tragic
figure Stuart Appleby and the tortured John Daly, were regrettably
culled from the competitive mix, there sat the ruddy-cheeked
Scotsman, eyeing the catbird seat.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a bogey on 18, he had fashioned a 67, one final errant
putt shy of the course record Tiger Woods established Thursday. And
for the second afternoon in a row, he could say, ``I got the best I
could get out of my round.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, being Monty, he had to find something about which to
grumble. It's generally accepted among his peers that Monty is the
finest whine ever produced by Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got Steve Elkington's picture up there, I see,'' he
said, frowning at the poster fluttering above him in the interview
room.
</P>
<P>
   The media tent is full of these large photos, each honoring the
many champions in the PGA's 80-year history. And Elk's hangs among
them because Monty's doesn't. The Houston-based Aussie beat the
Scot in a sudden-death playoff at Riviera in 1995, one of the
nearest of Monty's near misses.
</P>
<P>
   The only major Montgomerie hasn't contended in is his ``own,''
the British Open, where he routinely humiliates himself in front of
thousands of mortified countrymen. But his majors record is
otherwise fairly impressive, save for that conspicuous dearth of
first-place finishes.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to explain why he stays so frequently in the hunt, he
replies without a trace of blush: ``Because, well, I'm quite good.
That's why I'm here, you know. I am obviously quite talented and
good at my job.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was a slightly _ slightly _ more self-deprecating Monty
who paid us a visit Friday. He complained, at one time or another,
about all facets of his game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't hit the ball well for about six months now,'' he
said, admitting he's in the midst of ``more of a struggle than I've
ever had before'' as he attempts to correct a tendency to badly
pull his tee shots and misread his putts.
</P>
<P>
   He's playing it so safe at Sahalee that his driver hasn't left
his locker. He packs a 5-wood instead. As for his improved touch on
the greens, he credits the efforts of short-game guru Dave Pelz for
coaxing more confidence out of him. At Royal Birkdale, he whacked
70 putts Thursday and Friday, ``at least 10 too many'' and enough
to leave him on the south side of the cut.
</P>
<P>
   Monty scored well Friday because, for the most part, he putted
brilliantly, sinking ``a number of'' 20-footers. But when asked if
that was indicative of his skill or his luck, he waited for the
laughter to stop before answering: ``It's never luck. I have a lot
of skill. I have a lot of talent.''
</P>
<P>
   Enough to win this PGA?
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good about my score and my position,'' Monty said.
``It's a course I knew in practice would suit me, although I'm not
striking the ball well. I'm still hitting it fairly straight, which
you must do around here. If I can putt the same way on the weekend,
I obviously have a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing Monty never does, for all his bombast, is flat-out
predict victory for himself. He hasn't crossed the line between
unpopular and insufferable.

RUELAS BELIEVES, BUT OTHERS DON'T
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's not that people don't respect Rafael Ruelas.
They do. They just don't like tonight's title-elimination bout
against Kostya Tszyu in El Paso, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Ruelas, some believe, was exposed in a second-round knockout
loss to Oscar De La Hoya and a subsequent points defeat against
George Scott in 1995. Since then, some have said he has declined
even though he's 9-0 (eight knockouts) since fighting Scott.
</P>
<P>
   They're afraid he might get hurt against a fighter of Tszyu's
presumed ability and power. Tszyu is a 3-1 favorite in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Ruelas' reaction? Just watch the fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard the same comments,'' Ruelas said from his training
camp in a steamy-hot, non-air-conditioned gym in the Coachella
Valley, which has a similar climate to that of El Paso. ``What's my
response? Hard work, dedicating myself 100 percent. And on
(Saturday) I'll prove them wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't know what I've gone through, what my training has
been like. They'll see.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruelas' doubters say he has lost something, that he's looked
very ordinary against mediocre opponents. Rumor has it he has even
been pushed around in sparring. A possible reason? Ruelas, a very
aggressive boxer, has taken a lot of punches in his 55 fights
(52-3, 42 KOs).
</P>
<P>
   Some have even suggested that he's beginning to slur his words,
a sure sign that a fighter has had enough.
</P>
<P>
   Ruelas and his trainer, Joe Goossen, are baffled by such
contentions. A loss to De La Hoya is no disgrace. And the fight
against Scott was close.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, he has dispatched eight of his nine opponents in an
average of 3.4 rounds while remaining among the top-ranked fighters
in his weight class.
</P>
<P>
   And while Ruelas admits he's not a defense-first fighter, how
many times has he taken a beating in his career? Zero. The two
times he was stopped, he was knocked down by Mauro Gutierrez and
lost track of the count while De La Hoya essentially put him away
with one big left hook.
</P>
<P>
   The suggestions about his speech are particularly curious. He
said he might stumble over his words occasionally on television,
but he and Goossen don't believe his speech has deteriorated.
(Ruelas showed no signs of speech impairment during a half-hour
interview.)
</P>
<P>
   ``That (speech) is something I keep a close eye on,'' Ruelas
said. ``That's supposedly one of the signs that it's time to move
on. Well, I haven't noticed anything. If it were a problem, I would
walk away.''

   Ruelas believes he's a !ital!better!off! fighter today than he's
ever been. He has the experience, several years of weight lifting
has enhanced his strength and he and Goossen have worked
fastidiously on his most conspicuous weakness: his balance.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, certainly his intensity has not waned. Anyone
who has been in the ring with him will attest that he's like a
human swarm of bees.

   Welterweight contender Oba Carr, who has sparred with Ruelas in
preparation for tonight's bout and could face De La Hoya in
November, expected to plow through his lighter sparring partner
(Carr fights at 147 pounds, Ruelas 140). He didn't. He came away
impressed with Ruelas the boxer and Ruelas the person.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ridiculous,'' Carr said of the critical talk. ``I think
I'm the best welterweight in the world right now and he held his
own with me. He's durable, strong. Man, he digs to the body. He's
all of that. And I thought I was gonna walk all over him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also saw the way he presented himself, his personality. This
man must be respected, he must. I think (today's bout is) going to
be a very good fight.''
</P>
<P>
   If Ruelas beats Tszyu, he'll face Miguel Angel Gonzalez for the
vacant WBC super-lightweight title before the end of the year. He
also will have made it very difficult to dismiss him as a
legitimate force in his weight class.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I care about is that he gets to be champion of the world
again,'' Goossen said. ``You never get respect from people. There's
too much jealousy out there.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is, Raf respects himself, I respect Raf and the guy
standing in front of him in the ring had better respect Raf.''
