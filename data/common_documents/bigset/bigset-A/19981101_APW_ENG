Report: Teen kills six in amily hammer murder spree in Indonesia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A 17-year-old boy bludgeoned his
parents and fou siblings to death with a hammer after a family
argument, police said Sunday.
	   The suspect, M. Fahrizal Batubara, has been arrested and charged
in the Friday murders in Medan, 1,400 kilometers (870 miles)
northwest of Jakarta, said Lt. Col. Amrin Karim, a spokesman for
the local police.
	   Karim said Fahrizal, who was the youngest child in the family,
was despondent after an argument with his parents who had grounded
him.
	   ``He has admitted and is still being interrogated. So far, we
have not found any sign of mental disorder,'' Karim said.
	   Fahrizal told police he beat one of his sisters to death first
as she watched television. He then attacked his brother and killed
his 47-year-old mother when she ran in from the kitchen.
	   Fahrizal killed his father, a 60-year-old physician, when he
returned from weekly Islamic prayers at a nearby Mosque. He
murdered his two other sisters later.
	   Friends of Fahrizal said he telephoned them and invited them to
the house for a party. When they arrived, Fahrizal had already
removed floor board and begun digging a grave for the bodies.
	   They fled and called police.

Allison Moorer sings `Alabama Song' for adult country music fans

<TEXT>
	   NASHVILLE, Tennessee (AP) _ Robert Redford needed a voice that
embodied the length and depth of love, and the pain that comes when
it ends.
	   Newcomer Allison Moorer got the job in the film ``The Horse
Whisperer.'' ``A Soft Place To Fall'' is played while a cowboy
(Redford) dances with a married woman (Kristin Scott Thomas) whose
daughter has endured a tragedy.
	   Moorer is perfect for such emotionally complex material. On her
debut album, ``Alabama Song,'' she sounds wounded but tough, a
woman holding out against bitterness as life doles out heartache
after heartache.
	   While fellow country singer Shania Twain wins over teen-agers
with simple, catchy lyrics, Moorer discusses complex topics in
songs clearly meant for adults, songs like ``Is Heaven Good Enough
for You'' _ a tune about her mother, who was shot to death by her
father when Moorer was 13. He then killed himself.
	   Like her older sister, country singer Shelby Lynne, Moorer won't
discuss the murder-suicide. But the sadness about it seems
ingrained, even as the thin redhead talks excitedly about her new
solo career.
	   ``It didn't really click for me until I met the guy who's now my
husband, and we started writing songs together,'' Moorer said.
Doyle ``Butch'' Primm and Moorer wrote the bulk of ``Alabama
Song.''
	   Moorer grew up in Frankville, Alabama, north of Mobile. After
graduating from the University of South Alabama, she moved to
Nashville and lived with her sister, then a rising star. She sang
backup for Lynne, a superlative singer whose career began in a
blaze of publicity but has yet to fulfill its promise. She now is
working on an album for Mercury Records.
	   Tragedy played a part in Moorer's discovery as a solo act. Her
friend, Walter Hyatt, a respected Nashville songwriter and
performer, died in May 1996 in the ValuJet crash in the Everglades.
Moorer sang one of his songs at a tribute service, and caught the
ear of booking agent Bobby Cudd.
	   Cudd brought her to the attention of Tony Brown at MCA Records,
who eventually signed her to a recording contract. When Brown was
approached for help with material for ``The Horse Whisperer,'' he
submitted a Joe Ely song, and tacked on a performance by Moorer on
the same tape.
	   Soon, Moorer found herself on a movie set being directed by
Redford in a scene set at a barn dance. Almost all of ``A Soft
Place To Fall'' is played during the pivotal scene in the movie.
	   ``A Soft Place To Fall'' established Moorer's sound: traditional
country complete with steel guitar fronted by her haunted, hypnotic
alto. But country radio stations didn't show much interest. They
tend to favor peppy pop songs like Twain's, or more dramatic love
ballads.
	   Still, Moorer is optimistic. She sees radio shifting ``toward
more traditional stuff'' and points to the success of Lee Ann
Womack, Alan Jackson and Vince Gill whose ``If You Ever Have
Forever in Mind'' has done well.
	   ``I just think you got to hang in there,'' she says. ``Not
everybody gets lucky on their first single.''

Suddenly, Yiddish is in the air
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JERRY SCHWARTZ &QC; 
 &UR; AP National Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Mandy Patinkin tells a story:
	   According to Jewish folklore, every baby has a teacher in the
womb _ an angel who imparts all the world's knowledge. But at the
moment of birth, the cherub touches the child's lip and takes it
all away; we spend the rest of our lives relearning it all.
	   But occasionally, there is a glimmer of what was lost _ a sense
of deja vu or a bolt of inspiration that seems to come from
nowhere.
	   Maybe this is what happened to Patinkin. Maybe not. But it is as
good an explanation as any of how Patinkin ended up on a Broadway
stage seven times a week, singing songs in a tongue he does not
know.
	   ``Mayn Mirl!,'' he sings. ``Bakent hob ikh zikh mit mayn Mirl,
ir nomen, vi gezang vi zise harfn klang ikh shever.''
	   This is Yiddish, the mamaloshen (mother tongue) of European
Jewry, a language that was given up for dead when millions departed
for the New World, and millions of others perished in the old one.
	   But amazingly, Yiddish music is enjoying a rebirth. And it
involves more than just Patinkin's show, ``Mamaloshen,'' and its
album.
	   There is ``Di grine katshke'' (``The Green Duck''), described as
``a menagerie of Yiddish animal songs for children.'' There is
``The Well,'' 20th-century Yiddish poetry put to music by Israeli
chanteuse Chava Alberstein and the American band the Klezmatics.
	   And then there are scores of bands out there _ bands with names
like Yid Vicious and Tennessee Schmaltz, better-known bands like
the Klezmer Conservatory Band and the Andy Statman Orchestra _ that
celebrate the music known as klezmer.
	   ``I'm seeing something, all of a sudden, that's happening,''
says Itzik Becher, who represents both Ms. Alberstein and the
Klezmatics.
	   Not that it's really ``all of a sudden.''
	   Yiddish was the lingua franca of European Jews. Mostly German
(with contributions from Hebrew and many other languages), written
with Hebrew letters, it was the language of the home, the
marketplace and of celebrations. Yiddish culture reached its zenith
in the 19th century, producing writers like Sholom Aleichem and
Mendele Mokher Sforim.
	   Klezmer _ from the Hebrew ``klei zemer,'' instruments of song _
became the music of this golden age. It started with the violin,
then the clarinet and the accordion and brass instruments; it
lilted and frolicked, and later, it swung.
	   Yiddish popular music flourished in the early part of this
century, in the theater and in vaudeville. Even then it was
sometimes the stuff of nostalgia, sung by and to immigrants in an
often harsh goldene medina, or golden land.
	   ``Belz, my little town, Belz, my little home where I had so many
dreams,'' sings Mandy Patinkin _ in Yiddish.
	   Patinkin, the Broadway star who won an Emmy award as Dr. Jeffrey
Geiger, the heart surgeon on ``Chicago Hope,'' was raised in a home
where Yiddish was a stranger _ ``I never heard any of it in my
house, except maybe four or five words.'' That is not unusual at
the end of the 20th century: The 1990 census found that only
213,064 Americans spoke Yiddish at home, sometimes or always.
	   Eight years ago, Patinkin's friend, producersult is ``Mamaloshen.'' Most of the songs are sung
entirely in Yiddish, without translation; they include standards
like ``Belz,'' ``Raisins and Almonds'' and ``Rabbi Elimeylekh.''
	   But there are also songs written by American Jewish writers in
English, translated into Yiddish: Paul Simon's ``American Tune,''
Irving Berlin's ``God Bless America'' and ``White Christmas,''
Stephen Sondheim and Leonard Bernstein's ``Maria'' (the Yiddish
lyrics at the top of this story).
	   This is emotional, passionate stuff. ``There is a size to it,
there's an over-the-topness to it that is just right,'' Patinkin
says. ``I've been accused of being over the top all these years,
and I finally found the right material.''
	   To Patinkin, you don't have to be Jewish _ or even understand
Yiddish _ to love this music.
	   ``It touches a certain nerve in us that has to do with
heritage,'' he says. ``It's any people who were thrown off any
ship.''
	   Most reviews have been rapturous, but not everyone agrees.
	   Wolf Krakowski, whose Yiddish-language album ``Transmigrations''
is a peculiar mix of country, blues and East European sensibility,
derides Yiddish singers who ``couldn't order a sandwich in Yiddish
when they walk off the stage.''
	   And Henry Sapoznik, who helped write the Yiddish translations
for Patinkin, belittles ``Mamaloshen'' as an exercise in false
nostalgia. ``Nostalgia is a funny and elusive thing because it is
hard to be nostalgic for something that you didn't experience,'' he
says. ``Most people trade on the sepia-toned world of Yiddish. We
don't.''
	   By ``we'' he means the small group of musicians who, two decades
ago, launched what is called the klezmer revival.
	   Sapoznik is a member of Kapelye, a pioneering Yiddish band that
started in 1979; he also is a kind of eminence klez, running 16
KlezKamps over the years to spread the joys of Yiddish music to new
generations.
	   When he started, klezmer was an endangered musical species. An
assimilated American Jewry had turned its back on it, and the old
men who played it were dying off. In Israel, Yiddish was pushed
aside in favor of Hebrew, and Americans followed suit, Sapoznik
says.
	   But a renewed interest in ethnic identity _ many credit Alex
Haley's book ``Roots,'' about his own African heritage _ and the
rising popularity of world music opened the way for a Yiddish
comeback.

Four American soldiers, one South Korean killed in accident
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Four U.S. soldiers and one South
Korean soldier were killed when their armored vehicle fell off a
bridge into a river in darkness, the U.S. military command said
Sunday.
	   Two other American soldiers were also injured in the accident
which occurred on a bridge over the Imjin River 40 kilometers (25
miles) north of Seoul, Saturday night, it said.
	   The seven, all assigned to the 2nd Battalion, 17th Field
Artillery, 2nd Infantry Division at Camp Hovey, were returning from
a training support mission when their M981 Fire Support Vehicle
plunged into the river, the command said.
	   The two injured American soldiers were able to swim away from
the sinking vehicle and were saved, the command said. They remained
in stable condition at hospital on Sunday, it said.
	   The dead South Korean soldier is one of thousands of local
soldiers who are assigned to the U.S. Army under a joint training
program, called the Korean Augmentation to the U.S. Army.
	   The names of the dead and injured solders and other personal
details will be released upon notification of next of kin, the
command said.
	   An investigation was under way to determine the cause of the
accident, the command said.
	   Some 37,000 U.S. solders are stationed in South Korea under a
mutual defense treaty.

Sidney Poitier still operates on his own terms

 &UR; AP Entertainment Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEVERLY HILLS, California (AP) _ For Sidney Poitier, the offers
don't come in as they used to.
	   ``To be absolutely objective, the industry doesn't really have
that kind of need for me,'' Poitier says in an interview. ``I can
play fathers. I can play grandfathers. I can play interesting
characters. ... But that's the nature of being a 72-year-old.''
	   Seventy-one, actually. He'll turn 72 in February. But look for
no bitterness from Poitier. It's not his nature. For the last 50
years, from the day he arrived at 20th Century Fox from the New
York stage, he has told Hollywood to accept him on his own terms.
He's not stopping now.
	   ``I am sure, if habit continues, there will be offers next week
and maybe one next month, and maybe one six months from now, and
maybe one next year, to which I will say no,'' he says. ``And if an
occasional one among them is really seductive, I'll say yes.''
	   Which is what he did with his latest role, as a psychiatrist in
the TV movie ``David and Lisa,'' a remake of the 1962 film that
starred Keir Dullea and Janet Margolin about a pair of
psychologically troubled teen-agers who fall in love at a home for
disturbed youths. Poitier plays Dr. Jack Miller, the therapist who
slowly builds the trust of the compulsive David (Lukas Haas), a boy
obsessed with time and death. The movie, which also stars Brittany
Murphy as Lisa, was produced for television by Oprah Winfrey. It
airs Sunday on the U.S. ABC television network.
	   Shot in black and white for less than dlrs 200,000, the original
``David and Lisa'' was a critical and commercial hit that earned
director Frank Perry an Academy Award nomination. Dr. Miller was
played by Howard Da Silva, a white actor, but it's the type of role
any actor _ black or white _ could play.
	   But casting a black in such a role would have been unthinkable
in 1949 when Poitier arrived in Hollywood to star in the drama ``No
Way Out,'' the powerful Joseph L. Mankiewicz film that also marked
the film debuts of Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee.
	   ``Even those things that were possible 50 years ago were not
done, you follow?'' he says. ``There were people of quite
extraordinary gifts _ educators and business people _ all within
the structure of a segregated society, but the (movie) industry had
no need, no compunction to treat the black community other than how
they perceived them.''
	   And so there were very few parts of consequence for black
performers, and the roles Hollywood gave to blacks were insulting,
demeaning portrayals that did not truly mirror the talent,
intellect or accomplishments of black America.
	   ``Certainly, the majority of the parts, such as there were,
followed a very stereotypical behavioral pattern,'' Poitier says.
	   Poitier was born in Miami to a poor tomato farmer from a small
island in the Bahamas, where Poitier grew up. As a teen-ager he
went to New York, enlisted in the Army at age 16 by lying that he
was 18, and took a number of menial jobs, from dishwasher to
watchman.
	   When the American Negro Theater put an ad for actors in Harlem's
Amsterdam News, Poitier answered the call. He didn't get the job,
but was determined to succeed. He paid for his acting lessons at
the theater by working as its janitor, and eventually got an
understudy role, behind an up-and-coming performer named Harry
Belafonte.
	   More stage roles followed, and, in 1949, he auditioned for Fox
for ``No Way Out.'' Mankiewicz gave him the role of a doctor
treating a bigot's brother. Released in 1950, the movie's realistic
look at bigotry created controversy and was banned in some cities.
But the film established Poitier as star material.
	   By the end of the decade, Poitier was one Hollywood's biggest
stars. He was nominated for an Oscar for ``The Defiant Ones'' in
1958, and in 1963 became the first black to win as best actor, for
``Lilies of the Field.'' (Hattie McDaniel was the first black to
win an Oscar, for supporting actress as Mammy in 1939's ``Gone With
the Wind.'')
	   Poitier's peak year was 1967 when he starred in three big films:
``In the Heat of the Night,'' ``To Sir With Love'' and ``Guess
Who's Coming to Dinner.''
	   In weighing each acting offer, Poitier says, he tried to pick
only those roles that ``had some comment on human existence that
was compatible with my values.'' If they didn't measure up, he was
willing to walk away, even in the beginning of his career.
	   ``I had a power, and the power that I had, the only power that I
had, was to say no,'' he says. ``I had no power to influence, I had
no power to instruct. I only had the power to say no. And that was
sufficient, for me. I said, 'No, I don't want to do that. No, I
cannot do that. No, I'm not available for that.'''
	   His acting career faded in the 1970s and he turned increasingly
to directing: ``Uptown Saturday Night'' (with Belafonte and Bill
Cosby) and the 1980 hit ``Stir Crazy'' with Richard Pryor and Gene
Wilder. In the late 1980s, he returned, slowly and selectively, to
acting, finding roles in such features as ``Little Nikita,''
``Shoot to Kill'' and ``Sneakers.'' His last feature film was in
1997, in ``The Jackal.''
	   ``Now, I don't get offers of scripts that come in profusion, but
I get a sufficient number of offers,'' he says. ``I apply to them
the same criteria I've applied over the last 40 or 50 years. And
when one pops up like 'David and Lisa,' I do it.''
	   And if there isn't one available, he goes back to what he calls
``the business of living,'' which for him means time spent reading,
studying, contemplating. Poitier acknowledges, proudly, that right
now, apart from promoting the TV movie, there is nothing on his
Hollywood plate.
	   ``I don't have a job,'' he says. ``If you were to accurately
articulate my disposition, you would say I'm an unemployed actor
who should be going to the unemployment insurance office. But
that's a good place for me to be now at this point in my life.''

Technicolor insists they got it right this time in restoring

'Wizard of Oz' &QL;

<TEXT>
	   UNIVERSAL CITY, Califoria (AP) _ So maybe Rhett and Scarlett
were a little fuzzy at times last summer. Rest assured, Technicolor
says, this fall the Munchkins will look fabulous.
	   The color lab that restored ``Gone With the Wind'' amid
controversy and disappointment insists that this time the job was
done right with ``The Wizard of Oz,'' which Warner Bros. is
distributing Nov. 6 in an ambitious wide release.
	   ``It will blow you away,'' says Tim Reynolds, senior vice
president of plant operations for Technicolor, which scrambled
seven-days-a-week to finish the ``Oz'' job in time.
	   ``These colors are brighter. They're more distinct. The detail
is greater,'' adds veteran technician Richard J. Goldberg, who
oversaw the restoration. ``It's a better 'Wizard' than ever was. It
was never this good because our process today is superior to what
it was then.''
	   So now, they say, when Dorothy opens the door of her sepia-toned
farm house in Kansas, the glorious colors in the land over the
rainbow will burst onto the screen with a brilliance never before
seen.
	   Of course, this is the same Technicolor lab involved in last
summer's troubled ``Gone With the Wind'' restoration. Filmgoers
complained that large portions of the movie were out of focus and
that the sound wasn't properly synchronized.
	   These complaints triggered a flurry of finger-pointing and
denials, with blame placed on everyone from Technicolor to studio
brass to the minimum-wage kids running the projectors. Technicolor
says New Line Cinema, which was re-releasing the film, imposed a
substandard restoration system on the lab; New Line suggested the
problems were isolated, overstated by the media and quickly fixed,
though theatergoers continued to report otherwise during the run.
	   In any event, it did not dampen enthusiasm for the movie, which
grossed dlrs 4.3 million in limited release.
	   This time, for ``Oz,'' technicians used a different and, they
say, better restoration technique, working from the original ``Oz''
negative instead of using a lower-quality intermediary print, as
they did with ``Gone With the Wind.''
	   The sepia-toned, black-and-white Kansas segments that open the
movie, including Judy Garland's famous ``Over the Rainbow'' scene,
were restored with computer technology by another lab because the
original negatives for those scenes were lost in a fire.
	   The risk, here, is that Technicolor opens itself up to criticism
that it has overdone it, turning ``Oz'' into the first colorized
color movie by making Munchkinland more vivid than the original
filmmakers ever envisioned. It is a suggestion the blunt-talking
Goldberg rejects.
	   ``Is this what they intended? I don't know, dig them up and ask
them,'' said Goldberg. He contends the filmmakers would not have
used so many bright sets and so many brilliant costumes if they
didn't want to achieve a maximum color impact stunted only by the
limited technology of the day.
	   For Warner Bros., which acquired ``Oz'' when it picked up Ted
Turner's MGM library, much is riding on the film. The studio has
put out a string of financially disappointing films this year (``A
Perfect Murder,'' ``The Avengers,'' ``Wrongfully Accused,'' and
``Why Do Fools Fall in Love'') until it was charmed by ``Practical
Magic.'' Then the studio watched its next offering, ``Soldier,''
open weak.
	   Its biggest hit, ``Lethal Weapon 4,'' made more than a dlrs 100
million at the box office, but the profits were gobbled up by the
lucrative deals given to the stars and director. Along with ``Oz,''
the biggest remaining movie for Warners this year is the Tom
Hanks-Meg Ryan romantic comedy ``You've Got Mail.''
	   The re-release is particularly risky because Warners is gambling
that moviegoers who have probably seen the film several times on
video and on the yearly TV broadcasts will shell out money to watch
it on the big screen. The movie has grossed about dlrs 10 million
theatrically in the last 60 years, but when adjusted for inflation,
the figure reaches more than dlrs 200 million. It also has racked
up about dlrs 225 million in video sales.
	   For this run, the studio is launching an ambitious release
schedule. While ``Gone With the Wind'' played on only 214 screens
last summer, ``Oz'' is headed for more than 1,800. That means
Dorothy, Toto and company will be competing in America's
multiplexes alongside the new releases. Warners says ``Oz'' needs
to pass dlrs 25 million at the box office to qualify the re-release
as a success, but refuses to say how much it spent to restore the
film, create the nearly 2000 prints and market the movie.
	   ``The Wizard of Oz'' will have family audiences all to itself in
its weekend release, opening against the Adam Sandler comedy ``The
Waterboy,'' and the Denzel Washington thriller ``The Siege.''
	   For Technicolor, ``The Wizard of Oz'' project brings the lab
full circle. The movie had been shot with then-state-of-the art
Technicolor cameras and film and the original movie posters trumpet
``The Wizard of Oz'' as a ``Technicolor triumph.''
	   Over the years, Technicolor has profoundly influenced movies,
with the name itself conjuring up visions of eye-popping grandeur.
Invented during World War I, the process originally superimposed
green and red images on the screen. It was refined after the war,
with several Technicolor pictures released, including ``The Black
Pirate'' with Douglas Fairbanks in 1926, but it remained expensive
and the novelty began to wear off.

	   But in 1932, Technicolor came up with a three-color process,
using three strips of film for red, blue and yellow, creating much
more realistic and glorious images, and used the process on shorts.
Finally, in 1935, ``Becky Sharp,'' the film version of ``Vanity
Fair,'' became the first successful three-color Technicolor
feature. Later, the process was used on such films as ``The Wizard
of Oz'' and ``Gone With the Wind.''
	   Now, Technicolor has yet another new process, called
dye-transfer, which was used on both the ``Gone With the Wind'' and
``Oz'' projects.
	   It is a complicated system _ Goldberg's ``simple'' explanation
took 20 minutes _ but essentially involves exposing light through
the negative onto three separate films called matrices. Dye is then
transferred from the matrices onto a fourth film, making the final
print. The matrices are then kept to make additional prints for
theaters. By introducing color only in the last step, the quality
is better, Technicolor says, though the process is so new that it
still has minor bugs.
	   For ``Oz,'' technicians gingerly worked off the fragile _ and
priceless _ ``Wizard'' triple negative strips. Among the challenges
was making sure the strips were aligned properly, a task made all
the more difficult because the negatives had shrunk in places.
	   Technicians also referred to detailed logs kept by the movie's
original crew. The records, kept in Technicolor's archives, list
every shot: ``Judy through door,'' ``Judy holding dog,'' ``Fairy
waves hands,'' and give the corresponding technical details.
	   Technicolor is making two sets of movie prints. One of extremely
high quality is to be shown in only a few dozen specially equipped
theaters. A slightly lesser quality print is designed for standard
multiplexes. Both have digitally enhanced soundtracks.
	   For the opening black-and-white scenes, technicians at Pacific
Title/Mirage worked off a 1960s-era master copy that had been used
for duplicating. Using computer technology, each of the 44,000
frames was digitized and the scratches and other imperfections
painted out. Technicolor provided the sepia look.
	   ``What you're going to see,'' said Phillip Feiner, president of
Pacific Title Mirage, ``is a (black-and-white) image that is as
pristine as if you were viewing it in 1939.''

That Was the Week That Was
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   Entertainment highlights during the week of Nov. 1-7:
	   60 years ago: Capitalizing on the panic and publicity generated
by Orson Welles' radio broadcast of the play, ``War of the
Worlds,'' Universal rushed into release ``The Deadly Ray From
Mars.'' It was a feature version of the serial, ``Flash Gordon's
Trip to Mars,'' with Buster Crabbe.
	   55 years ago: ``The North Star'' starred Dana Andrews, Anne
Baxter and Walter Huston.
	   50 years ago: ``The Snake Pit,'' a film about mental asylums,
starred Olivia de Havilland.
	   45 years ago: Walt Disney's ``Toot, Whistle, Pluck and Boom,''
the first CinemaScope cartoon, was released.
	   40 years ago: ``The Blob'' was Steve McQueen's first starring
role. He was billed as ``Steven'' McQueen. Burt Bacharach composed
the film's title song.
	   35 years ago: Ann-Margret, in London for the premiere of ``Bye
Bye Birdie,'' told reporters about Elvis Presley: ``I'm going
steady with him and I guess I'm in love.''
	   ``It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World'' premiered at a theater in
Hollywood. The Cinerama film starred Spencer Tracy, Milton Berle,
Sid Caesar, Buddy Hackett, Mickey Rooney, Phil Silvers and Ethel
Merman.
	   Singer Dion walked out of a live taping of the British TV
program, ``Ready, Steady, Go,'' claiming that he was distracted by
the go-go dancers.
	   And the Beatles opened their first official headlining tour as
Beatlemania began to grip Great Britain. A headline in the Daily
Mirror said: ``You have to be sour square not to love the nutty,
noisy, happy, handsome Beatles.''
	   10 years ago: A white Kramer guitar autographed by Eddie Van
Halen went for dlrs 2,900 at a rock 'n' roll auction to benefit the
Philadelphia Music Foundation. The event raised about dlrs 32,000.
Also on the auction block: Chubby Checker's boots, a harmonica
autographed by Bob Dylan and a surfboard signed by the Beach Boys.
	   Rock star Roger Daltrey's recipe for trout in sweet pepper puree
was among nearly 150 recipes compiled for a children's charity
cookbook. About one-sixth of the proceeds from the ``Celebrity
Choice Cookbook'' was earmarked for the British Broadcasting
Corp.'s Children in Need Appeal.
	   Singer-songwriter Smokey Robinson received the Founders Award,
the highest award of the American Society of Composers, Authors and
Publishers. Robinson was lead singer of the Miracles during the
1960s. His prolific career produced such hits as ``You've Really
Got a Hold on Me'' and ``The Tears of a Clown.''
	   And comedian Bill Cosby announced that he would give dlrs 20
million to Atlanta's Spelman College. The donation was the largest
in Spelman's 107 years. Episodes of ``The Cosby Show'' had been
filmed at the black women's college.
	   Five years ago: More than 120,000 people attended Madonna's
sexually explicit ``Girlie Show'' in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Those
attending the concert defied a Roman Catholic condemnation of the
``malevolent'' spectacle, calling Madonna their ``Queen of Rock.''
	   Merchant-Ivory's ``The Remains of the Day'' starred Anthony
Hopkins, Emma Thompson, Christopher Reeve and James Fox.
	   And Capitol Records released Frank Sinatra's ``Duets,'' the
singer's first album in nine years. Accompanying Sinatra on various
cuts were Liza Minnelli, Barbra Streisand, Aretha Franklin, Tony
Bennett, Natalie Cole, Anita Baker, Gloria Estefan, Carly Simon,
Charles Aznavour, Julio Iglesias and Kenny G.
	   One year ago: The Spice Girls scooped up the coveted best group
award at the MTV Europe Music Awards. The British all-girl band
beat out an all-guy challenge from Oasis, Prodigy, Radiohead and
U2.
	   Spoken 10 years ago:
	   ``I'm a sucker for the powerful story. I could do the easy thing
and not have to go and kill myself each time. I don't know why I
do, but it's the way I am.'' _ Actress Meryl Streep.
	    &UR; Spoken five years ago:
	   ``''My father never earned over dlrs 75 a week. The minute I
made dlrs 100 a week, I thought I was successful. I always figured
as long as I could pay my car note and sing, I'd be happy.'' _
Singer Kenny Rogers.
	   ``Even if I get my face fixed and get a tummy tuck _ which I
won't _ I still want to be a character actor, because I think they
have the best job in the business.'' _ ``Seinfeld'' regular Wayne
Knight.

	   In the spotlight: Joni Mitchell _ don't put a label on her
	    &UR; Image vs. reality: The reclusive Joni Mitchell, whose folk-jazz
and hippie songs have influenced contemporary acts from Jewel to
Fiona Apple, may well be the ultimate icon of depressed
confessionalism, the creator of heartsick classics that have served
as emotional blankets for sensitive souls.
	   But don't mistake the singer for her songs.
	   ``It's interesting how people hear your sad songs and think you
must be miserable or whatever,'' she says. ``They don't think
William Shakespeare was miserable just because he wrote about
tragedy. I see myself as a singing playwright and an actress, and I
try to make plays that are pertinent to our times.''
	    &UR; Personal stats: Mitchell was born Roberta Joan Anderson on Nov.
7, 1943, in Fort Macleod in Alberta, Canada. She was raised in
Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. She developed polio when she was 9, and
now says the illness made her prematurely adult and stubborn.
	   Five years later, she wasn't just walking, she was dancing. She
took up painting and dance, making the transition to guitar with
the help of an instructional record by Pete Seeger.
	   The turning point was Bob Dylan's ``Positively Fourth Street.''
	   ``I thought a song was a song and a poem was a poem, '' she
says. ``But that particular song was a song about anger that was
very well-put. And I thought, 'We can write about anything now. The
door is ajar.'''
	   She took Joni as her stage name. (Her close friends still call
her Joan.) The surname came after a brief marriage in the 1960s to
folk singer Chuck Mitchell.
	   ``I came into the game playing classical art songs,'' she says.
``But I looked like a folk singer, like the girl with the guitar.
So folk music was easy and I needed money for art school.''
	   In 1968, she released her first album, ``Song for a Seagull.'' A
year later, her self-penned ``Clouds'' album was released,
featuring Mitchell's versions of ``Chelsea Morning'' and ``Both
Sides Now.''
	   She has released some 19 eclectic albums during her 30-year
career. Some of her more familiar songs include ``Big Yellow Taxi''
and ``You Turn Me on, I'm a Radio,''
	    &UR; Today: In 1995, she accepted the prestigious Century Award at
the Billboard Music Awards. She won two Grammys for ``Turbulent
Indigo'' in 1996. She was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of
Fame in 1997. That same year, the singer was reunited with a
daughter she had put up for adoption more than 30 years earlier.
	   Her newest album, ``Taming the Tiger,'' is a masterful
collection of ballads and social commentary.
	    &UR; Rock or folk?: ``I never considered myself a rock artist or a
folk artist,'' says the woman who rivaled Dylan and Joan Baez in
the folk-rock movement of the 1960s. ``People just saw a girl with
an acoustic guitar and said, `Folk singer.' But to me, my roots
were in classical music.''

Norma Kamali's customers 'shop like a celebrity' on the Internet
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: New York Fashion Week will run Nov. 2-6 &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photo NY346 &QL; 
 &UR; By CAROL DEEGAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Designer Norma Kamali would rather read e-mail
than put on a runway show.
	   ``Everybody loves a show, and then with the celebrities infusion
into it, it became another layer of theater,'' said Kamali,
referring to New York-based designers and the semiannual runway
shows coordinated by 7th on Sixth.
	   But don't look for Kamali when the tents go up at Bryant Park in
midtown Manhattan for Fashion Week.
	   ``Fashion shows? How prehistoric is that?'' she said in an
interview at her 56th Street flagship store. ``When we have all
kinds of great media and we have fashion shows? It's like Carnival.
I just stopped doing them. I couldn't do them anymore.''
	   Kamali isn't the only designer who won't be sending models down
the runway for the spring 1999 collections. Halston pulled the plug
on its show. Todd Oldham, who is focusing on his jeanswear, was
quoted in Women's Wear Daily as saying he'd rather do a movie than
put on another runway show.
	   ``After 30 years in this business, I cannot, under any
circumstances, do the same thing over and over again,'' Kamali
said. ``I had to do something else, absolutely.''
	   That ``something else'' is Kamali's Web page _
www.omo-norma-kamali.com _ where customers are invited to ``shop
like a celebrity'' 24 hours a day.
	   By going to the Web site, consumers can shop from anywhere in
the world. They can view online the latest Norma Kamali designs in
swim, gym, evening and sportswear.
	   Photos and videos keep customers updated on new merchandise.
	   Here's how it works: A personal stylist selects each customer's
size, color preferences and special needs. Then a selection of
clothing is sent to the customer's home or office against her
uncharged credit card. Customers have 48 hours to ship back any
clothing they do not wish to purchase.
	   ``The whole concept of 'shop like a celebrity' came about with
my celebrity clients,'' Kamali said. ``A lot of them are on the
road traveling. ... And if they're doing a movie, if they're in
music and they're doing concert tours, they like to have things
sent to them.''
	   Although she declined to name her celebrity clients, she said,
``There was a period of time in the '70s where I did clothes for
EVERYBODY in rock 'n' roll.''
	   Extending her personalized service to all her customers was the
next step.
	   ``So many women work, have children, don't have time to shop,
when they do, because they're going to a wedding or something, they
fly in the door and fly out and buy things in haste and it's not
really thought out clearly,'' Kamali said.
	   The success of this service, in a day when everyone is pressed
for time, proves to be the ultimate in luxury and convenience for
everyone, not just celebrities.
	   ``So the 'shop like a celebrity' service has become more and
more a constant rather than this special thing we do,'' Kamali
said. ``And once women get into it and feel comfortable with it, it
really is a very exciting situation and everybody loves it.''
	   Has anyone tried to keep the clothes without paying for them?
	   ``Nobody's taken advantage of it, and we've never had to charge
people for clothes that didn't come back, none of that, because I
really believe people are so happy to shop this way, they want to
do it again and again,'' she said.
	   Her Web site includes an online catalog, toll-free telephone
number and e-mail address. If a consumer doesn't have access to
online services, Kamali will send a video tape and photographs of
the collection.
	   ``We get stacks of e-mail, and it's the best,'' she said.
``People feel that they can talk to me directly, and they say
things to me that are just hysterical. I read them all. Absolutely
every single one of them.''
	   Kamali was born and raised in Manhattan.
	   After graduating from the Fashion Institute of Technology in
1964, she pounded the pavement with her portfolio before going to
work as an airlines office worker _ a job that got her cheap
flights to London, where she bought clothes that she sold in her
own Manhattan boutique, along with, eventually, her own designs.
	   ``Sixties clothes were in the boutiques,'' she said. ``And the
truth is that we are back to that point again. It's so great, it's
so exciting that new designers can, like Daryl K, start in a
shop.''
	   She opened a Kamali shop on East 53rd Street in midtown
Manhattan in 1968.
	   Her first designs featured elaborate appliques, lizard and
leather patches, snakeskins and T-shirts with rhinestone studs. (No
wonder her name is mentioned in the same breath as Todd Haynes' new
film, ``Velvet Goldmine,'' which recalls glam fashion and the early
'70s British rock scene.)
	   After reinventing herself over and over again, changing her
customer base completely, and getting involved with huge companies
and licensing, ``I really feel this 'direct to the client' is
really the way I want to go,'' Kamali said.
	   The Norma Kamali collection is exclusively distributed through
her flagship store. Limited quantities are produced for each style.

Timothy Hutton stars as notorious spy Aldrich Ames in Showtime
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; AP Photo LA300 &QL; 
 &UR; By BOB THOMAS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ The shocking story of CIA veteran Aldrich
Ames passing U.S. secrets to the Soviets for eight years without
detection seemed like a natural for a spy movie. Now it has
happened.
	   Timothy Hutton plays the title role in ``Aldrich Ames: Traitor
Within,'' which aired on the U.S. Showtime cable channel Sunday,
Nov. 29, with repeat screenings in December.
	   Ames served 20 years with the CIA before starting to sell
secrets to the KGB in 1985. He had been overlooked for promotion
and had fallen into heavy debt because of extravagance by himself
and his Bolivian wife, Rosario (played by Elizabeth Pena).
	   For eight years Ames continued funneling vital data to the
Soviets, some of which led to the deaths of valued CIA informants.
Even though he bought a costly home and upscale cars, his superiors
never suspected him. It took a veteran analyst, Jeanne Vertefeuille
(Joan Plowright), to expose him.
	   Hutton, 38, who won the 1980 Academy Award for supporting actor
as the sensitive youth in ``Ordinary People,'' is no newcomer to
movies about espionage.
	   He played another real-life spy in the 1985 ``The Falcon and the
Snowman,'' and in 1983, he starred in ``Daniel,'' based on E. L.
Doctorow's novel ``The Book of Daniel,'' concerning the son of a
pair of spies resembling Julius and Ethel Rosenberg.
	   Although he has appeared in other dark roles in recent times,
Hutton admits that he had a twinge of doubt about playing Ames.
	   ``But I'm an actor, and I recognize a good part when I see it,''
he commented. ``It was a wonderfully written screenplay, and I
thought it was smart not to make it sympathetic. Nor did it want to
bury the guy.
	   ``It just told the story. I think you realize when you see it
that this is someone who just became completely out of control
because of the personal burdens that he mostly put on himself.''
	   Indeed, ``Aldrich Ames: Traitor Within'' bears a resemblance to
the John le Carre novels and their film versions, which portray
spies nonjudgmentally as working professionals who are drawn into
situations that cause them to betray their countries.
	   The film pictures Ames as a humdrum CIA official who has risen
through the ranks despite a record of drinking and lax performance.
He performs his traitorous deeds mechanically, with scant concern
for secrecy and with a total lack of remorse.
	   ``I think he felt that the only way out of his personal problems
was to sell documents to the KGB,'' observed Hutton. ``But money
problems happen to a lot of people, and there are other ways he
could have solved them.
	   ``That clearly was the flaw in his thinking: not realizing the
consequences, people were going to be killed, possibly the security
of the United States in other parts of the world was going to be
compromised. I think it just wasn't thought through.
	   ``Had the film continued on to when he was in prison, we would
have been able to show a side of Ames that I saw during an
interview in which he does confess remorse. He understands the
consequences.''
	   Hutton gained insight for his portrayal by studying various
films of Ames. His conclusions: ``He had trouble dealing directly
with people. Something was preventing him from being who he was.
Many, many walls surrounded him.''
	   ``Aldrich Ames: Traitor Within'' resembles Washington and its
environs, but it was actually filmed in Toronto, like so many
cost-conscious TV movies these days.
	   ``I think they'd even shoot a Western in Toronto_ if they
could,'' Hutton joked.

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Take a deep breath before sitting down to watch
``American History X.''
	   It's violent. It's harsh. It's harrowing and it's painful. It's
also an incredible exploration into inhumanity _ and, ultimately,
humanity.
	   Director Tony Kaye was apparently so displeased with the final
edit of ``American History X'' that he applied to have his name
withdrawn from the credits. What a shame. This is a memorable,
significant movie with which Kaye should be proud to be associated.
	   Edward Norton plays Derek Vinyard, the son of a fallen
firefighter who struggles through late adolescence by turning to
the neo-Nazi movement. With a charismatic way with words and a
swastika tattooed on his muscle-rippled chest, he has become
something of a teen idol among a budding urban white-hate crowd.
	   His younger brother, Danny (Edward Furlong), needs a new role
model, and Derek is right there. Danny idolizes him, and when Derek
is sent to prison for brutally killing a young black man who tries
to steal his car, Danny takes up the supremacist mantle. His patron
is the same man who guided Derek _ Cameron (Stacy Keach), an aging,
virulent white-power leader who lives vicariously through the
movement's younger participants.
	   Sweeney (Avery Brooks), the intense principal of Danny's high
school, has seen Derek slip away and wants desperately to save
Danny. But his task is difficult.
	   Beyond this, there is actually very little ``plot,'' strictly
speaking, to ``American History X.'' It is, instead, an engaging
series of forward-moving tableaux, alternating between the present
_ Danny's perspective _ and black-and-white flashbacks of Derek's
time in prison and his slow journey away from hate.
	   The film's biggest strengths lie in its individual scenes. A
game of basketball becomes a street referendum on race. The
ransacking of a Korean grocery, videotaped with glee by one of the
participants, is unforgettable in its casual hatred. And when Danny
and Derek remove Nazi paraphernalia from their bedroom walls, the
silent scene speaks more than any dialogue could.
	   Norton is a master of switching personalities. He's alternately
menacing and benign, depending on the scene _ flashback or present.
Up until now, the only real glimpse we've seen of his dark side
came at the end of ``Primal Fear,'' and in ``American History X''
Norton shows he can follow through; his intense eyes convey more
than most actors' entire bodies.
	   It is Furlong, though, who carries the film. His faltering
adolescent _ drifting toward the dark side _ is a study in torn
loyalties. His performance is subtle, genuine and, ultimately,
heartfelt.
	   Brooks (``Star Trek: Deep Space Nine'') is an accomplished and
intense performer, and his turn as the principal struggling for two
souls anchors the story. But myriad smaller roles make ``American
History X'' even stronger.
	   Beverly D'Angelo shows nice depth as the frail widow Doris
Vinyard. Jennifer Lien is memorable as the boys' sister, Davin, and
Ethan Suplee is intimidating as Seth, the giant neo-Nazi who
idolizes Derek. Keach, of course, is great as usual. His
age-mottled racist conveys both regular-guy normalcy and
on-the-edge lunacy. And Elliott Gould makes a welcome appearance as
a Jewish teacher who tries to date Doris, with disastrous recults.
	   There is, however, one niggling narrative gap: Derek seems to
have converted too easily. Yes, Sweeney's pull is strong, and yes,
prison can be a persuader, but to see Derek grapple with it more
would have rung truer.
	   The editing, despite the director's objections, is impressive.
Transitions between past and present, color and black-and-white,
are seamless and explore the roots of Derek's hate. Sometimes the
flashbacks are longer than the ``present'' _ an engaging narrative
weave that lends unease, but rarely confusion, to the film.
	   Politically, ``American History X,'' with its well-executed
links between subtle and overt racism, is a racial polemic.
Artistically, it's a film to remember.
	   ``American History X,'' a New Line Cinema release of a
Truman-Morrissey Co. production, is produced by Jon Hess and David
McKenna from McKenna's script.

At The Movies: `John Carpenter's Vampires'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: movie opened Friday &QL; 
 &UR; By TED ANTHONY &QC; 
 &UR; AP National Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ When Hollywood trots out vampires, the results
are visually enjoyable but usually predictable. Oral fixations.
Elaborate graveyard scenes. Nubile women dancing the line between
allure and decay. Only occasionally do cinematic chronicles of the
undead rise above.
	   ``John Carpenter's Vampires,'' an exceptionally bloody entry in
the canon of Nosferatu, does. It's not just mediocre schlock. It's
well-executed, engrossing, innovative ... schlock.
	   Carpenter, of course, knows how to do horror. From the original
``Halloween'' to his unsettling remake of ``The Thing,'' he can
push viewers' buttons like no other. But with ``Vampires,'' he
takes another dimension further: Visually, it's just stunning.
	   In New Mexico, where the skies seem a deeper blue and the Earth
a bloodier red, vampire slayer Jim Crow (James Woods) leads a
high-tech team scouring the parched Southwest, looking for nests of
the undead. Crow is a callous, often cruel man with a troubled,
tragic childhood who does the Roman Catholic church's dirty work of
eliminating the unholy.
	   At his side is Montoya (Daniel Baldwin), an alternately
caffeinated, sullen, aggressive and protective partner who hides
many dimensions behind his trusty-sidekick demeanor.
	   When most of Crow's team is killed during a motel party by a
king vampire (Thomas Ian Griffith) named Valek in revenge for a
nest strike, Crow goes nuts. The 600-year-old vampire somehow knows
Crow's name, so Crow knows he's been set up. Crow and Montoya band
together with a prostitute, Katrina (Sheryl Lee), who has been
bitten by Valek, and they go on the hunt. Along the way, they pick
up a young priest, Father Adam Guiteau (Tim Guinee), whose naivete
and earnestness only angers Woods. Thus does the odyssey begin.
	   The role of Crow is perfect for Woods' unhinged, manic persona.
He's as psychotic as the creatures he's killing, and he can carouse
with hookers as well as any amoral slime ball. Yet he is the
world's next best thing to a holy man.
	   Baldwin (``Mulholland Falls,'' TV's ``Homicide'') turns in an
unexpectedly resonant performance as Montoya. His fate is tragic
but altogether appropriate.
	   The haunted glamour that Lee used as Laura Palmer in ``Twin
Peaks'' serves her well here. She is a confused, angry young woman
who slowly realizes she is becoming a vampire and begins to
understand the appalling implications. The scenes where she is
linked psychically to Valek are some of the most suggestive _ and
intriguing _ of the film.
	   Maximilian Schell, in a small role, plays a priest who advises
Crow.
	   Blood, to be sure, is a staple of vampire movies. Carpenter
applies it to excess, but he uses a few early scenes to establish
the almost cartoonish quality of his violence. So by the time a
priest is decapitated and a group of monks are set upon by a pack
of vampires, the gore, for better or worse, has been folded into
the story.
	   Carpenter has always done well with that balancing act, and here
he has clearly perfected it; this is one of his most violent films
to date, yet the violence doesn't overshadow the story.
	   What makes ``Vampires'' special is its look, rendered lovingly
by production designer Thomas A. Walsh and cinematographer Gary B.
Kibbe. They use southwestern Spanish architecture to evoke gothic
and Old West flavors, subtly linking the New Mexico landscape to
the Old World stomping ground of cinema's traditional vampires.
Adept uses of light, shadow and sunset round out the appearance for
a sensory treat.
	   As ``Vampires'' draws to its end, in a deserted New Mexico town
populated entirely by vampires, Crow and Montoya begin to
understand the true significance of Valek. They realize they must
succeed, or the consequences will be horrific.
	   Whether they do or not is ultimately irrelevant. Their journey _
an odyssey that blends genres into nothing less than a horror
Western _ is a worthy addition to the vampire legend set in a
landscape that might have unsettled even Bela Lugosi.
	   ``John Carpenter's Vampires'' is produced by Sandy King from a
Don Jakoby screenplay.

Downer defends Australian intelligence, praises Indonesia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Foreign Minister Alexander Downer has
praised the efforts of Indonesia's government in East Timor over
the past six months despite reports that as many as 18,000 troops
remain in the troubled area.
	   Downer also rejected suggestions that Australia's intelligence
agencies had failed to keep tabs on the extent of Indonesia's troop
deployment in East Timor.
	   ``They may or may not have done what they said they would do in
terms of troop numbers,'' Downer told Australian television Sunday.
``But in broader terms I think the Indonesian government has done
more over the last six months than they've done over the previous
23 years on this question of taking forward the East Timor peace
process.''
	   Documents leaked to media last week indicated Indonesia had
failed to reduce the number of troops stationed in the disputed
half-island territory despite President Habibie's personal promise
to do so.
	   East Timor military chief of staff Lt. Col. Supadi told The
Associated Press last week that the number of troops in East Timor
stands at 15,000 after about 1,000 were withdrawn in July and
August.
	   Downer said Australia was still seeking verification about the
documents, noting that the Indonesians had made a number of
statements since the documents were produced, which left the
question of troop numbers unclear.
	   Asked why Australia had to seek verification from Indonesia,
Downer said, ``I'm not going to say anything about intelligence but
I'll put it to you this way, there have been rumors about troop
numbers, they have been varied rumors.''
	   Australia's ambassador spoke to the Indonesian government about
troop numbers in East Timor on Oct. 21, Downer said.
	   Pressed on whether Australia's intelligence service advised the
federal government what was happening or had failed to alert the
government, Downer said, ``I'm not telling you lies.''
	   ``I'm telling you that, understandably, no government is going
to talk about intelligence but secondly, there have been rumors
about troop numbers in East Timor which have suggested that the
draw down of troops hasn't occurred to the extent the Indonesians
said it would occur.''
	   But Downer said it was not a sign of failure by the intelligence
sources. ``There hasn't been a huge intelligence stuff-up, of
course, but I'm not going to get into intelligence questions,''
said Downer. ``It's neither fair on the Australian government nor
the Australian people to try to get us to talk about those
issues.''

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTIC CITY, New Jersey (AP) _ WBO featherweight champion
Prince Naseem Hamed, who predicted a third-round knockout, needed
all 12 rounds Saturday night for a unanimous decision over scrappy
Wayne McCullough.
	   Fighting in his usual herky-jerky, ambidextrous style, Hamed
danced and weaved, Ali shuffled and showboated his way to the
victory in a less-than-impressive performance.
	   Judge John Stewart had it 118-110, judge Nelson Vazquez 117-111
and judge Clark Sammartino 116-112 for Hamed. The AP had Hamed
winning 116-111.
	   A 5-1 favorite, Hamed kept McCullough at bay with his bizarre
tactics but never knocked him down or seriously hurt him. In fact,
Hamed (31-0) spent much more time clowning than he did punching.
	   McCullough, of Belfast, Northern Ireland, was the aggressor
throughout, but he couldn't hurt Hamed either. Cheered on by more
than 1,000 flag-waving Irishmen who made the trip, he sustained
some solid shots and connected on some of his own.
	   Hamed connected on 46 percent of his 742 punches, to 23 percent
for McCullough, who threw 740, according to CompuBox Inc. punch
statistics.
	   On the undercard of the fight, which was televised by HBO, IBF
junior featherweight champion Vuyani Bungu of South Africa retained
his title with a 12-round majority decision over Danny Romero of
Albuquerque, New Mexico. Also, Marco Antonio Barrera took the WBO
junior featherweight title from champion Richie Wenton, stopping
him in the third round of a scheduled 12-rounder.
	   Hamed, 24, of Sheffield, England, promised an early finish to
the ``Fright Night'' card at Convention Hall. But his prediction _
a knockout at 2:28 of the third round _ never happened.
	   Showing no defense whatsoever, throwing punches from the bottom
of his trunks and switching from left-handed to right-handed on
whims, Hamed was booed heartily by the crowd of 8,138 for his
inactivity in the seventh round.
	   McCullough, 28, who fights out of Las Vegas, was a silver
medalist at the 1992 Olympics. His other defeat was a 12-round
decision at the hands of Daniel Zaragoza in January 1997.
	   McCullough (22-2) weighed in at 124 pounds (56 kilos), one less
(half a kilo less) than Hamed. The class limit is 126 pounds (57
kilos).
	   Hamed made dlrs 2 million, McCullough dlrs 500,000.

Inmate organ donation likely to be blocked by law
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A prison inmate seeking to donate part of his
liver to a dying patient will likely be rejected because of a law
restricting transplants from living donors enacted in the territory
earlier this year.
	   ``Basically we don't usually accept a stranger who steps forward
to donate part of the liver to an unrelated person,'' said Lo
Chung-mau, a doctor and associate professor at the Queen Mary
Hospital, where 41-year old patient Fung Kwok-leung is being
treated for acute liver failure.
	   Fung's case made headlines in local media when his 8-year old
daughter made a public appeal last Thursday on a radio show for
help to save her father.
	   Lo said that the law, the Human Organ Transplant Ordinance, was
passed to prevent people from selling their organs, or other
people's organs.
	   ``If you just say you want to save a person's life, this is not
a good enough reason. Ethically, there is some concern that there
may be a sort of financial implication behind the scene,'' he said.
``Unfortunately, that's the case.''
	   The Stanley Prison recently contacted hospital officials on an
inmate's behalf to inquire about the donation procedure.
	   ``We tell them that this is not a money or blood donation; there
is substantial risk for the donor. Most of the time a stranger
would not be prepared to do that,'' Lo said.
	   Meanwhile, Fung's condition is deteriorating as his kidney is
starting to fail.
	   Organ donations are not widely accepted in Hong Kong due to
cultural and social reasons and the number of transplants is only
about 10 percent of that in many other countries with more
widespread donations, Lo said.
	   He said there are usually about 15 liver transplants from brain
dead donors each year, but that such a donation could come too late
as Fung only has days to live.
	   If the inmate still wishes to donate, he or she would need to
file an application and be reviewed by the Organ Transplant Board,
Lo said, but said it was unlikely it would be accepted.

	   ATLANTIC CITY, New Jersey (AP) _ The biggest mouth in boxing
since Muhammad Ali almost had to eat his words for the first time.
But he stayed unbeaten.
	   WBO featherweight champion Prince Naseem Hamed, the boastful
Brit with the 30-fight winning streak, couldn't make good on his
promise to knock out Wayne McCullough in the third round Saturday.
	   He needed all 12 rounds to score a unanimous decision over the
scrappy Irishman, who tagged him several times with hard rights but
could never knock him down or put him in serious danger.
	   ``He was quite strong,'' Hamed said. ``I tried to knock him out
in the third round. What can I say? He's got a hard head. He's
Irish, you know.'
	   Hamed danced and weaved his way to the victory, but was on the
receiving end of more than a few boos because of his attitude.
	   Judge John Stewart had it 118-110, judge Nelson Vazquez 117-111
and judge Clark Sammartino 116-112 for Hamed. The AP had Hamed
winning 116-111.

	   ``It was willed by God to go 12 rounds and it went 12 rounds,''
Hamed said. ``I'm still the best lightweight in the world. He took
a beating. Look at his face and look at mine. I won easy.''
	   McCullough, 28, who fights out of Las Vegas, was a silver
medalist in the 1992 Barcelona Olympics. He is 22-2, with the only
other defeat a 12-round decision at the hands of Daniel Zaragoza in
January 1997.
	   ``He ran from me,'' McCullough said. ``He didn't come to me and
never hurt me. He's strong physically but he never hurt me.''
	   McCullough weighed in at 124 pounds (56 kilos), Hamed 125 pounds
(56.5 kilos). The class limit is 126 (27 kilos).
	   Hamed made dlrs 2 million, McCullough dlrs 500,000.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Schumacher out of race, giving Hakkinen title &QL; 
 &UR; By K.P. HONG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SUZUKA, Japan (AP) _ Finland's Mika Hakkinen won his first
Formula One championship Sunday when German star Michael Schumacher
was knocked out of the Japanese Grand Prix on the 32nd of 53 laps.
	   Hakkinen, seeking his eighth victory of the year, had the lead
when Schumacher, running third, dropped out after the right rear
wheel on his Ferrari shredded.
	   Schumacher, a two-time Formula One champion, topped qualifying,
but was forced to start from the back of the field after his car
stalled on the second attempt to begin the race. On the first
attempt, Jarno Trulli stalled on the grid forcing the officials to
abort the start.
	   Schumacher entered the race four points behind Hakkinen in the
season standings. The German needed to win the race and have
Hakkinen finish third or worse to claim the season championship.
	   Schumacher took the pole by touring the 5,830 kilometer
(3,644-mile) Suzuka Circuit in 1 minute, 36.293 seconds, a run of
217.6 kph (136.234 mph) in his Ferrari.

	   SUZUKA, Japan (AP) _ Finnish driver Mika Hakkinen claimed the
Formula One championship Sunday and his eighth win of the year
after rival Michael Schumacher dropped out of the Japanese Grand
Prix with a blown tire.
	   The German ace, aiming for his third world title, retired after
31 laps when the right rear tire on his Ferrari blew out.
	   Schumacher would have needed to win the race with Hakkinen
finishing third or worse to claim his third world title.
	   Driving a McLaren, Hakkinen took the checkered flag after 51
laps over the 5.864-kilometer (3.636-mile) Suzuka Circuit.
	   Schumacher's Ferrari teammate Eddie Irvine was second and
Hakkinen' teammate Coulthard third.
	   The tire failure was the end of an already bad day for
Schumacher. He lost the pole position in Sunday's season-ending
race after his engine stalled at the start.
	   Schumacher was charged with a false start and sent to the back
of the driver's grid. That put his Finnish rival on the pole.
	   Hakkinen held the lead throughout the race for his eighth
victory of the year.
	   The championship was the first for the 30-year-old Hakkinen who
many thought would never race again after a near-fatal crash in
1995.
	   Schumacher's car trouble also gave Hakkinen's McLaren team a
lock on the constructor's title, its eighth.
	   Schumacher entered the race four points behind Hakkinen in the
season standings.
	   Schumacher took the pole by touring the 5,830 kilometer
(3,644-mile) Suzuka Circuit in 1 minute, 36.293 seconds, a run of
217.6 kph (136.234 mph) in his Ferrari.

Activists against capital punishment, want change in executions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Civil rights activists are pushing to
replace gunshot executions by lethal injections, but want Thailand
to eventually abolish capital punishment, a newspaper said Sunday.
	   Statements from activists followed the execution last Thursday
of former policeman and convicted killer Supoj Penglkai. It was
this year's only execution.
	   Executions by shooting, introduced in 1935, have been carried
out 279 times. Waiting on death row are 53 convicts.
	   The Corrections Department has proposed switching to executions
by lethal injection, arguing that this is considered more humane
and in line with international practice.
	   The Nation newspaper quoted Somchai Homla-or, a leading civil
rights activist, as saying injections were far more humane and a
step towards the total abolition of capital punishment.
	   Somchai said capital punishment was outdated and did not deter
criminals.
	   Under current practice, prisoners are blindfolded and strapped,
with the executioner firing a mounted rifle.
	   While many are sentenced to die, most death penalties are not
carried out. Legal authorities are influenced by the Buddhist
precept that no living things should be killed.

Seventy-two people sentenced to death in October
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine courts sentenced 72 people
to death mostly on rape convictions last month, bringing to 820 the
number of death row convicts since capital punishment was restored
in 1994, an anti-crime group said Sunday.
	   Among those given the death penalty was a British man convicted
of raping his 12-year-old stepdaughter and a police official who
kidnapped and killed a businesswoman, the Citizens' Drugwatch
Foundation said.
	   Of the 72, 37 were convicted of rape, 16 of kidnapping, 11 of
murder and eight of robbery with homicide, said the foundation,
whose members are mostly Philippine lawmakers fighting crime.
	   The 1987 constitution abolished the death penalty but gave
Congress the option to restore it for crimes such as murder,
kidnappings for ransom, rape and drug trafficking.
	   A law that brought back capital punishment took effect in 1994.
Its return has triggered debates that have divided many Filipinos.
	   Prison authorities said they are waiting for a lower court to
set the date for the execution by lethal injection of Leo
Echegaray, the first convict to be scheduled for execution under
the 1994 law.
	   Echegaray, a poor house painter, was convicted of repeatedly
raping his 10-year-old stepdaughter.
	   Sen. Loren Legarda, a member of the foundation, said that among
those sentenced to death last month were 11 people, including three
women, who kidnapped an elderly fish trader in a Manila suburb.
	   Also sentenced to death was Albert Ernest Wilson of Kent,
England, who was convicted of raping the daughter of his common-law
Filipino wife in suburban Valenzuela in metropolitan Manila.
	   Wilson, 46, became the 11th foreigner to be sent to death row.
	   A police chief inspector and an air force serviceman were also
sentenced to death for kidnapping and later killing a businesswoman
in the central Philippines.
	   Legarda said 459 of those in death row were convicted of rape,
159 of whom abused their children or other relatives.
	   Many Filipinos favor the return of the death penalty, arguing it
can deter crimes such as rape and kidnapping. Roman Catholic
bishops and other civic groups, however, oppose it, saying there is
no proof it can deter crimes.
	   Opponents also say the poor are disadvantaged because they
cannot afford good lawyers for their defense.

Iraq allows nuclear monitoring team to move into field
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ A single nuclear monitoring team went into
the field in Iraq on Sunday, exempt from Iraq's decision a day
earlier to end cooperation with U.N. inspectors for other weapons
of mass destruction.
	   Members of the four-man team refused to talk with reporters as
they left their headquarters at the Canal Hotel on the outskirts of
Baghdad.
	   Iraq announced Saturday that it was halting all cooperation with
the U.N. Special Commission, which is responsible for overseeing
the destruction of Iraq's biological and chemical weapons and its
long-range missiles.
	   But it said monitors of the International Atomic Energy Agency,
a U.N. body headquartered in Vienna, Austria, could continue to
work.
	   A U.N. official confirmed Sunday that the team that went out was
from the IAEA. He said UNSCOM inspectors were not being sent out.
He spoke on condition his name not be used.
	   Iraq's decision drew a strong condemnation from the U.N.
Security Council, which called Baghdad's decision ``a flagrant
violation'' of council resolutions and of an understanding between
Iraq and U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
	   The written understanding last February averted military action
against Iraq over country's refusal to allow the inspection of
Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's palaces.
	   Iraq's action Saturday was a further step in its battle to try
to force the U.N. Security Council to declare UNSCOM's work
complete and to lift punishing trade sanctions imposed after Iraq's
1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   On Aug. 5, Iraq said UNSCOM and the IAEA could conduct no more
spot inspections but could continue monitoring work at previously
declared sites. Saturday's decision eliminated even that for
UNSCOM.
	   Iraq said it would not back down until the Security Council
pledges to begin moving to lift the sanctions. It also demanded
that Richard Butler, head of UNSCOM, be dismissed.

	   SUZUKA, Japan (AP) _ Finnish driver Mika Hakkinen claimed the
Formula One championship Sunday and his eighth win of the year with
a victory in the Japanese Grand Prix.
	   Hakkinen's rival for the championship, German Michael
Schumacher, dropped out of the race with a blown tire in his 31st
lap.
	   ``It took quite a while and now it has happened,'' said a
jubilant Hakkinen.
	   Driving a McLaren, Hakkinen led throughout the race to take the
checkered flag after 51 laps over the 5.864-kilometer (3.636-mile)
Suzuka Circuit. Schumacher's Ferrari teammate Eddie Irvine was
second and Hakkinen' teammate Coulthard finished third.
	   The race was essentially over before it began.
	   Schumacher, aiming for his third title, lost the pole position
for the season-ending race after his engine stalled at the start.
	   Schumacher was charged with a false start and sent to the back
of the driver's grid. That put his Finnish rival on the pole.
	   For Schumacher to win the championship he needed to fight his
way from the back of the pack and needed Hakkinen to finish no
better than third.
	   Although he made it as far as fourth position before the tire
failure, it seemed unlikely he would have stopped Hakkinen who was
more than 20 seconds ahead at that point.
	   Hakkinen finished the race 6.4 seconds ahead of Ferrari's
Irvine.
	   ``It was easier than some of the racing has been in the past
this year,'' said Hakkinen.
	   The championship was the first for the 30-year-old Hakkinen who
many thought would never race again after a near-fatal crash in
1995.
	   The win also gave Hakkinen's McLaren team the constructor's
title, its eighth.
	   The Finn earned 10 points for the victory for a season-total of
100. Schumacher had 86.

Schumacher's Ferrari teammate Eddie Irvine was second over the
5.864-kilometer (3.636-mile) Suzuka Circuit, 6.491 seconds behind
Hakkinen. Hakkinen' teammate Coulthard finished third.
	   The race was essentially over before it began.

position after he was charged with a false start for the engine
stall. He was sent to the back of the driver's grid, giving Finnish

Iraq hosts largest trade fair since Gulf War
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By EILEEN ALT POWELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ France shipped in the latest-model Peugeot
sedans. The Palestinians brought hand-made inlaid boxes from
Bethlehem. The Sudanese came with peanuts and sorghum, the Iranians
with refrigerators and pharmaceuticals.
	   They're among 30 countries taking part in the Baghdad
International Fair opening Sunday that's being billed as the
largest in Iraq since the 1991 Gulf War.
	   The turnout ``shows the increasing desire of companies to
establish relations with Iraq,'' the fair's director, Fawzi Hussein
al-Dahur, told the official Iraqi News Agency.
	   The fair is opening a day after Iraq took a new stand against
U.N. weapons inspections, announcing it was halting the work of
weapons monitors until the Security Council moves toward lifting
eight-year-old trade sanctions against the country.
	   As the finishing touches were being put on the pavilions
Saturday, participants acknowledged that they saw only limited
trade opportunities while the U.N. sanctions remain in place.
	   ``But everyone feels that the sanctions will end soon,'' said
Servet Akkaynak as he stood amid tillers, asphalt cutters and
electrical generators made in his native Turkey.
	   ``Iraq is a good potential market for us,'' he added. ``We had a
long history of trade, and we're high on re-establishing
ourselves.''
	   The sanctions, imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, ban
most business dealings, except under the special, U.N.-approved
oil-for-food program.
	   Saturday's refusal to allow U.N. monitors to work _ which
strengthened an August ban on spot inspections _ was meant to push
for ending the sanctions. But the Security Council termed the
action a ``flagrant violation'' of U.N. resolutions and urged
Baghdad to reverse its decision.
	   Ministers or deputy ministers from about a dozen countries were
expected to attend the 10-day fair to discuss future trade deals.
	   A visitor getting close attention was Iranian Commerce Minister
Mohammad Shariatmadari, one of the highest-ranking Iranian
officials to come to Iraq since the two countries fought a brutal,
eight-year war in the 1980s.
	   After meeting Saturday with Iraqi Trade Minister Mohammed Mehdi
Saleh, Shariatmadari announced that the two countries would set up
joint committees to discuss trade and commercial ventures, INA
said.
	   The fairgrounds in Baghdad's up-scale Al-Mansour neighborhood
bustled with products being unloaded from semi-trailer trucks and
booths being decked out with flags and other national symbols.
	   A large portrait of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, in his
traditional black-and-white checked headdress, greeted visitors to
the Palestinian booth. At the Iraqi Industry Ministry building,
workers installed a larger-than-life portrait of President Saddam
Hussein in a gray business suit.
	   Egypt _ with 58 companies constituting one of the largest
delegations _ hadn't been to the Baghdad fair in years, said Antoun
Labib, director of the Egyptian international exhibitions office.
	   Its firms are showing everything from tractors and reapers to
children's clothes, fruit juice and corn oil.
	   ``This is a good opportunity for Egyptian companies to make
contacts for the future,'' Labib said. ``The case of Iraq is
beginning to come better now.''
	   Still, many won't find buyers until the sanctions are lifted.
	   At the Peugeot booth, Iraqi dealer Sadir Bazagan said the shiny
burgundy, blue and olive green Peugeot 406s on display would be
shipped out of Iraq after the show in compliance with the U.N.
sanctions.
	   He noted that Iraqi streets are crowded with Peugeots, but that
most date to the early- and mid-1980s.
	   ``There was a big market here before the Gulf War,'' he said.
``We are all waiting anxiously for the future.''

After five years in power, Canada's folksy leader draws fire
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DAVID CRARY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde don't share power in
Canada, but lately it seems that way.
	   Jean Chretien completes his fifth year as Canada's prime
minister this week riding as high as ever in public opinion polls.
	   Yet Chretien's carefully crafted image as a folksy ``little
guy'' now coexists with a different image. Adjectives like
``arrogant'' and ``intolerant'' have become commonplace in recent
weeks as influential media outlets join opposition politicians in
an unusually sustained offensive against the still-popular prime
minister.
	   Even supposed allies in Chretien's native Quebec _ those waging
a provincial election campaign against separatists _ are railing at
him, saying he should consider quitting because of comments about
Quebec's future that played into separatists' hands.
	   The criticism was encapsulated in a recent cover story titled
``For the Love of Power'' in Macleans magazine, which as Canada's
foremost news weekly tries to avoid partisanship.
	   The article said a growing number of critics ``believe the
self-styled little guy ... is actually a closet authoritarian,
ruthlessly intolerant of opinions other than his own.''
	   Last weekend, William Thorsell, editor-in-chief of the
nationally circulated newspaper The Globe and Mail, wrote a column
describing Chretien as perpetually angry.
	   ``Why does the prime minister react so aggressively and cruelly
to the most straightforward of human situations?'' Thorsell asked.
``He governs from the personal insecurity that dares not ask for
help or show magnanimity.''
	   One catalyst for the current criticism is an inquiry into
whether police used excessive force to suppress student protesters
a year ago when they demonstrated against Indonesia's former
President Suharto at a Pacific Rim summit hosted by Chretien. The
protesters contend police were obliging Chretien's desire to spare
Suharto embarrassment while in Vancouver.
	   Chretien, who denies intervening in police affairs, has bruised
some feelings by repeatedly joking about the pepper-spray used by
police against the protesters. His government rejected requests to
pay the students' legal bills, and he has discouraged any public
dissent on the matter from Parliament members of his Liberal Party.
	   His attitude prompted critics to recall past instances where
Chretien showed a thin-skinned side _ when he placed a chokehold on
a protester who crossed his path, and replied brusquely during a
nationally televised town hall meeting to a woman concerned about
unemployment.
	   Peter Donolo, the prime minister's communications director,
insists most Canadians are satisfied with Chretien despite
occasional flaps about his temperament.
	   ``In each of these cases, the opposition and the media are ready
to bury the prime minister,'' Donolo said in a telephone interview.
	   ``He's got everybody against him except the people on most of
these issues.''
	   Chretien, who turns 65 in January, grew up in a Quebec mill
town, the 18th of 19 children.
	   He has served in Parliament almost non-stop since 1963 and
became prime minister on Nov. 4, 1993. He was re-elected in June
1997 to a second term, and hasn't ruled out running for a third.
	   His Liberal Party seems unconquerable at the moment. The
parliamentary opposition is divided among four parties, none with
coast-to-coast strength and all below 20-percent support in
national polls.
	   Some critics say this lack of a political threat has been
unhealthy for Canada and Chretien's administration.
	   ``Chretien's Liberals have become so complacent they are no
longer bothering to conceal their arrogance,'' wrote columnist
Richard Gwyn in the Toronto Star.
	   Chretien's approval rating hovers around 60 percent, though some
opponents insist his public appeal will fade.
	   ``He's an old guy with old ideas,'' said Deborah Grey, deputy
leader of the right-wing Reform Party. ``This is the year people
will start to say, `We've got some concerns about this guy.'''
	   Chretien has never claimed his government is exciting. He boasts
of its lack of scandals and its economic achievements, notably
erasing Canada's budget deficit for the first time in three
decades.
	   Donolo attributes the furor over the anti-Suharto protest to
``scandal envy'' on the part of Canadian journalists who don't have
anything as racy as the Clinton-Lewinsky affair to cover.
	   ``It's not like we're making a hell of a lot of news, and we're
not giving them a lot of raw meat in terms of scandals,'' he said.
``It's pretty tame stuff.''
	   Donolo conceded there were frustrations among rank-and-file
Liberal legislators about limits on their influence in
policy-making. But overall, he said Chretien had given Canadians
what they expected.
	   ``People know Chretien so well at this point, they don't base
their judgment on what his latest uttering is,'' Donolo said.
``Sometimes they agree with him, sometimes they don't. But they
base their judgment on his history in public life and his
management of the country.

Iraq hosts largest trade fair since Gulf War

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ France shipped in the latest-model Peugeot
sedans. The Palestinians brought hand-made inlaid boxes from
Bethlehem. The Sudanese came with peanuts and sorghum, the Iranians
with refrigerators and pharmaceuticals.
	   They're among 30 countries taking part in the Baghdad
International Fair opening Sunday that's being billed as the
largest in Iraq since the 1991 Gulf War.
	   The turnout ``shows the increasing desire of companies to
establish relations with Iraq,'' the fair's director, Fawzi Hussein
al-Dahur, told the official Iraqi News Agency.
	   The fair is opening a day after Iraq took a new stand against
U.N. weapons inspections, announcing it was halting the work of
weapons monitors until the Security Council moves toward lifting
eight-year-old trade sanctions against the country.
	   As the finishing touches were being put on the pavilions
Saturday, participants acknowledged that they saw only limited
trade opportunities while the U.N. sanctions remain in place.
	   ``But everyone feels that the sanctions will end soon,'' said
Servet Akkaynak as he stood amid tillers, asphalt cutters and
electrical generators made in his native Turkey.
	   ``Iraq is a good potential market for us,'' he added. ``We had a
long history of trade, and we're high on re-establishing
ourselves.''
	   The sanctions, imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, ban
most business dealings, except under the special, U.N.-approved
oil-for-food program.
	   Saturday's refusal to allow U.N. monitors to work _ which
strengthened an August ban on spot inspections _ was meant to push
for ending the sanctions. But the Security Council termed the
action a ``flagrant violation'' of U.N. resolutions and urged
Baghdad to reverse its decision.
	   Ministers or deputy ministers from about a dozen countries were
expected to attend the 10-day fair to discuss future trade deals.
	   A visitor getting close attention was Iranian Commerce Minister
Mohammad Shariatmadari, one of the highest-ranking Iranian
officials to come to Iraq since the two countries fought a brutal,
eight-year war in the 1980s.
	   After meeting Saturday with Iraqi Trade Minister Mohammed Mehdi
Saleh, Shariatmadari announced that the two countries would set up
joint committees to discuss trade and commercial ventures, INA
said.
	   The fairgrounds in Baghdad's up-scale Al-Mansour neighborhood
bustled with products being unloaded from semi-trailer trucks and
booths being decked out with flags and other national symbols.
	   A large portrait of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, in his
traditional black-and-white checked headdress, greeted visitors to
the Palestinian booth. At the Iraqi Industry Ministry building,
workers installed a larger-than-life portrait of President Saddam
Hussein in a gray business suit.
	   Egypt _ with 58 companies constituting one of the largest
delegations _ hadn't been to the Baghdad fair in years, said Antoun
Labib, director of the Egyptian international exhibitions office.
	   Its firms are showing everything from tractors and reapers to
children's clothes, fruit juice and corn oil.
	   ``This is a good opportunity for Egyptian companies to make
contacts for the future,'' Labib said. ``The case of Iraq is
beginning to come better now.''
	   Still, many won't find buyers until the sanctions are lifted.
	   At the Peugeot booth, Iraqi dealer Sadir Bazagan said the shiny
burgundy, blue and olive green Peugeot 406s on display would be
shipped out of Iraq after the show in compliance with the U.N.
sanctions.
	   He noted that Iraqi streets are crowded with Peugeots, but that
most date to the early- and mid-1980s.
	   ``There was a big market here before the Gulf War,'' he said.
``We are all waiting anxiously for the future.''

Iraq allows nuclear monitoring team to move into field
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ A single nuclear monitoring team went into
the field in Iraq on Sunday, exempt from Iraq's decision a day
earlier to end cooperation with U.N. inspectors for other weapons
of mass destruction.
	   Members of the four-man team refused to talk with reporters as
they left their headquarters at the Canal Hotel on the outskirts of
Baghdad.
	   Iraq announced Saturday that it was halting all cooperation with
the U.N. Special Commission, which is responsible for overseeing
the destruction of Iraq's biological and chemical weapons and its
long-range missiles.
	   But it said monitors of the International Atomic Energy Agency,
a U.N. body headquartered in Vienna, Austria, could continue to
work.
	   A U.N. official confirmed Sunday that the team that went out was
from the IAEA. He said UNSCOM inspectors were not being sent out.
He spoke on condition his name not be used.
	   Iraq's decision drew a strong condemnation from the U.N.
Security Council, which called Baghdad's decision ``a flagrant
violation'' of council resolutions and of an understanding between
Iraq and U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
	   The written understanding last February averted military action
against Iraq over country's refusal to allow the inspection of
Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's palaces.
	   Iraq's action Saturday was a further step in its battle to try
to force the U.N. Security Council to declare UNSCOM's work
complete and to lift punishing trade sanctions imposed after Iraq's
1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   On Aug. 5, Iraq said UNSCOM and the IAEA could conduct no more
spot inspections but could continue monitoring work at previously
declared sites. Saturday's decision eliminated even that for
UNSCOM.
	   Iraq said it would not back down until the Security Council
pledges to begin moving to lift the sanctions. It also demanded
that Richard Butler, head of UNSCOM, be dismissed.

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ World leaders and U.N. officials faced a
new crisis with Iraq Sunday after the government announced that it
would no longer allow U.N. weapons inspectors to work in the
country.
	   The U.N. Security Council late Saturday unanimously condemned
Iraq's decision and demanded that Baghdad rescind the decision
immediately and unconditionally.
	   The council called Saturday's announcement from Baghdad ``a
flagrant violation'' of council resolutions and a memorandum of
understanding between Iraq and U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
that averted military action against Iraq in February after another
crisis over weapons inspections.
	   It reiterated the council's offer to review Iraq's compliance
with U.N. resolutions if it resumes cooperation with U.N. weapons
inspectors.
	   The decision by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and his top
advisers exempted only a handful of experts from the International
Atomic Energy Agency, who monitor suspected nuclear sites.
	   On Sunday, a four-man team from the IAEA left their headquarters
on the edge of Baghdad for a monitoring assignment, refusing to
speak to reporters. A U.N. official said other weapons monitors
would not be working. He spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Iraq's move Saturday was seen as a response to the Security
Council's decision Friday to review Iraq's progress on eliminating
prohibited weapons.
	   Although it pledged a ``comprehensive review,'' the council did
not accede to Iraq's demand that the review lead directly to the
removal of the sweeping trade sanctions imposed in 1990 after
Baghdad's forces invaded Kuwait.
	   The sanctions cannot be lifted until the Special Commission
certifies that Iraq has eliminated its weapons of mass destruction.
Iraq insists it has done so, but the commission says Baghdad
continues to hide information on weapons, especially those with
biological and chemical agents.
	   Iraq's statement issued Saturday said the ban would continue
``until the United Nations looks at the issue in an honest and
positive way, leading to Iraq's right to the lifting of the unjust
sanctions.''
	   Iraq also insisted that the Security Council fire Richard
Butler, chief of the U.N. Special Commission that oversees weapons
inspections. Iraq has long accused Butler of working on behalf of
the United States to prolong sanctions.
	   It remained unclear if Saturday's decision would provoke the
United States and Britain to threaten military action against
Baghdad, as they did earlier this year after the Iraqi regime
prevented U.N. inspectors from entering Saddam's presidential
palaces. Both U.S. and British officials condemned the move.
	   In Washington, U.S. President Bill Clinton's national security
advisers were reviewing the situation and consulting with allies
and U.N. officials, said David Leavy, a spokesman for the U.S.
National Security Council. ``We view this as a serious matter,''
Leavy said.
	   U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen canceled a weeklong Asian
tour to return to Washington and participate in U.S. administration
discussions over the new standoff with Iraq.
	   Saddam Hussein's decision caused jitters in Baghdad. Currency
traders said the already depressed Iraqi dinar fell from 1660 to
the dollar to 1760 from within minutes of the announcement.
	   Iraqi Trade Minister Mohammed Mehdi Saleh told reporters
Saturday that the country would stand firm.
	   ``This is the decision of the people of Iraq and the leadership
of Iraq to save the sovereignty of Iraq and the right of the people
to live,'' Saleh said.
	   The sanctions have severely damaged the Iraqi economy by
limiting the sale of oil, banning air travel and prohibiting most
other financial dealings with Iraq.
	   Saturday's decision deepens a dispute that began Aug. 5, when
Iraq announced that teams from the Special Commission and the
atomic agency could no longer carry out spot inspections. But Iraq
allowed both groups to continue long-term monitoring, often done
with cameras and sensors, at previously identified weapons sites.
	   The Iraqi Information Ministry issued a statement late Saturday
saying the government was not asking the roughly 120 U.N. monitors
and support staff to leave Iraq. It added that the monitoring
cameras and sensors installed at weapons sites could continue to
operate.
	   ``Iraq was disappointed because lifting of the sanctions didn't
go in a normal fashion,'' the statement said. It added that the
Security Council decision Friday had been made under ``clear
pressure from America.''

<TEXT>
	   SUZUKA, Japan (AP) _ Finnish driver Mika Hakkinen claimed the
Formula One championship Sunday with a victory in the Japanese
Grand Prix, his eighth win of the year.
	   Hakkinen's rival for the championship, Michael Schumacher, lost
the pole position for the race after his engine stalled at the
start. The German ace later dropped out of the race in the 32nd lap
with a blown tire.
	   ``Since 1993, I've fought to win races and be world champion. It
took quite a long time and now it has happened,'' said a jubilant
Hakkinen.
	   Driving a McLaren, Hakkinen led on each of the 51 laps, taking
the checkered flag in one hour, 27 minutes, 22.535 seconds.
Schumacher's Ferrari teammate Eddie Irvine was second over the
5.864-kilometer (3.636-mile) Suzuka Circuit, 6.491 seconds behind
Hakkinen. Hakkinen's teammate, Briton David Coulthard, finished
third.
	   The race was essentially over before it began.
	   Schumacher, aiming for his third title, lost the top starting
position after he was charged with a false start for the engine
stall. He was sent to the back of the driver's grid, giving
Hakkinen the pole.
	   Schumacher's trouble came during a restart called after Jarno
Trulli made a false start in his Prost Peugot.
	   To win the championship, Schumacher would have needed to fight
his way from the back of the pack _ and needed Hakkinen to finish
no better than third.
	   Although he made it as far as third position before the tire
exploded, it seemed unlikely he would have caught Hakkinen, who was
more than 20 seconds ahead.
	   ``It was easier than some of the racing has been in the past
year,'' said Hakkinen.
	   The title was the first for the 30-year-old Hakkinen, who many
thought would never race again after a near-fatal crash in 1995.
	   The victory also gave Hakkinen's McLaren team the constructor's
title, its eighth.
	   The Finn earned 10 points for the victory for a season total of
100. Schumacher had 86.

least 58 people, according to a local mayor, and pushing up the
death toll from one of the strongest Caribbean hurricanes to at
least 450.
	   Only 57 of the 2,500 people living in 10 communities at the foot
of Casitas Volcano had been accounted for by Saturday evening,
Mayor Felicita Zeledon of Posoltega, about 20 miles (30 kilometers)
south of mudslide area, said in an interview with the government's
Radio Nicaragua.

Human Rights group wants probe into reports of atrocities in
</HEADLINE>
northern Afghanistan &QL; 
 &UR; By KATHY GANNON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Calling the slaughter of Afghan
civilians in northern Afghanistan by invading Taliban soldiers
``one of the worst atrocities of Afghanistan's long civil war,''
Human Rights Watch called Sunday for a speedy investigation by the
United Nations.
	   In interviews with survivors, who reached neighboring Pakistan,
officials of the U.S.-based Human Rights Watch heard horrific
stories of marauding Taliban soldiers shooting at ``anything that
moves.''
	   Survivors said soldiers went house to house dragging out ethnic
Hazaras, who are Shiite Muslims, and shooting them, rounding up
hundreds, perhaps thousands of young men, and packing them into
rail cars for transportation to jail.
	   ``In a very brutal war, this is a particularly brutal episode,''
said Patricia Gossman, senior researcher of Human Rights Watch's
Asia Division. ``We are talking about the systematic execution of
perhaps 2,000 civilians, in large part because of their ethnic and
religious identity.''
	   The Taliban religious army, which rules roughly 90 percnet of
Afghanistan, took control of the northern opposition stronghold of
Mazar-e-Sharif in August.
	   During the bloody takeover eight Iranian diplomats and an
Iranian journalist also were killed.
	   The Taliban leadership blamed renegade Taliban troops for the
killings, which caused Tehran to deploy more than 200,000 soldiers
to its border with Afghanistan, where the troops still remain.
	   Iran accuses the Taliban of targeting Afghanistan's minority
Shiite Muslims and conducting a campaign of ``ethnic cleansing,'' a
charge denied by the Taliban, who are mostly Sunni Muslims.
	   The Taliban accuses Iran of fomenting violence among
Afghanistan's Shiite Muslims, who are often referred to as Hazaras,
named for the region they come from.
	   During a visit to the region in October to defuse border
tensions between Iran and the Taliban, The United Nations special
envoy Lakhdar Brahimi got a promise from the Taliban's reclusive
leader, Mullah Mohammed Omar, to participate in a commission to
investigate the reports of mass killings in northern Afghanistan.
	   But Omar also demanded a probe by the United Nations into the
massacre in 1997 of at least 2,000 Taliban soldiers, who were
reportedly shoved into deep wells, and killed when their Uzbek
captors threw grenades into the wells and fired automatic rifles at
the dying troops.
	   The Human Rights Watch report urged the U.N. High Commissioner
for Human Rights to conduct a ``thorough investigation'' of the
alleged Taliban killings of civilians and the reported massacre of
Taliban soldiers by opposition ethnic-Uzbek soldiers.
	   ``The Taliban apparently carried out the massacre in revenge for
the killing of thousands of its own soldiers in Mazar in 1997.
Human Rights Watch urged the United Nations to investigate that
atrocity as well,'' the report said.
	   ``Determining the truth about what happened would represent the
first step toward accountability,'' said Gossman. ``It could also
provide a means toward breaking the cycle of revenge killings that
has characterized the civil war in Afghanistan.''

Seven killed, 35 missing in speedboat collision in Borneo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Two speedboats collided on a river in
Borneo, leaving at least seven people dead and 35 missing,
Indonesia's official news agency reported Sunday.
	   Boats carrying 50 and 31 passengers collided head-on Saturday on
the Katingan River, and rescuers recovered seven bodies, including
a woman and two children, the Antara news agency said.
	   It said 39 passengers, among them a district chief, were rescued
or swam to safety, and the many injured among the survivors were
taken to a hospital in the provincial capital of Palangkaraya,
about 550 miles (880 kilometers) northwest of Jakarta.
	   Palangkaraya is in Indonesia's Central Kalimantan province on
Borneo.

Fitzpatrick feared for his life in South Africa
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ Former New Zealand rugby captain
Sean Fitzpatrick has revealed he was so scared of South African
fans that he feared for his life on the 1996 tour.
	   ``I was almost paranoid to the extent that I wondered if I could
get set up, that they would get rid of me,'' Fitzpatrick said in a
new book about his career released Sunday.
	   Fitzpatrick, who retired after a record 92 tests for the
national team, revealed his fears in a book call ``Turning Point _
The Making Of A Captain,'' written by New Zealand journalist Duncan
Johnstone.
	   Fitzpatrick, who succumbed to a knee injury to announce his
retirement early this year, also discloses in the book how he
declined All Black coach John Hart's offer to become the team's
assistant coach.
	   He says Hart first offered him the job to coach the All Black
forwards when he was struggling with his knee injury during the
end-of-the-year tour of Britain last year.
	   He was given a deadline of April this year.
	   However, Hart's own deadline arrived as Fitzpatrick was still
contemplating whether to continue his playing career this year.
	   Hart raises doubts in the book about whether, in hindsight,
Fitzpatrick could have done the job.
	   Fitzpatrick led New Zealand for his last two seasons and riled
opponents with his nagging of referees and niggling play.
	   He believes the hype of the '96 tour, where the All Blacks
successfully won their first series in South Africa, was
potentially dangerous.
	   ``It got to the stage where I would hardly go outside. I'd never
go anywhere by myself, I'd go out only with the team,'' Fitzpatrick
said.

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ A fire broke out on an oil tanker and a
cargo shipped docked nearby at Beirut port Sunday, port officials
said.
	   The officials quoted by Beirut radio stations said one person
was injured in the fire which started early in the morning. The
names and nations from which the two ships come were not
immediately known.
	   Smoke billowing from the port area caused a huge black cloud
over the capital. The fire on the two ships was still raging at
mid-morning.
	   The radio quoted the officials, whose names were not given, as
saying the fire may have started from oil spill. They gave no
further details.

Multi-media arts festival inspired by Anwar's ouster
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos Expected &QL; 
 &UR; By JOCELYN GECKER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Twenty feet (Six meters)
underground in a studio with black concrete walls might not seem
like the ideal space to discuss free speech.
	   But the venue is a downtown Kuala Lumpur theater in a shopping
mall below Freedom Square _ the hotbed of political dissent where
popular dissident leader Anwar Ibrahim led 30,000 anti-government
protesters before his arrest. He goes on trial Monday on sexual
misconduct and corruption charges, which he has called politically
motivated.
	   The event _ a multi-media arts festival inspired by Anwar's
ouster from high office _ focuses on planting seeds to help
expression thrive.
	   ``This is not a protest against the government,'' said Loh Kok
Man, one of the artistic directors. ``But we have a lot of
questions _ and we know we're not alone.''
	   Since the Sept. 20 arrest of Anwar, the former deputy prime
minister, normally placid Malaysians have staged massive street
rallies in defiance of police bans.
	   Risking arrest, tear gas and violence, the crowds demand justice
for Anwar, an end to the 17-year rule of Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad and repeal of draconian laws allowing jail without trial.
	   At a recent show titled, ``You Have 10 Minutes!'' _ the words
shouted by police to disperse anti-government rallies _ a group of
young artists performed short skits.
	   In the dark theater, one actor held the spotlight as he read the
audience their inalienable rights from the federal constitution,
highlighting free speech, assembly and association.
	   ``Before I started reading the constitution, I felt I had very
few rights,'' said the actor, Zahim Albakri. ``But now I know
better. Now, I want to know more.''
	   The play, whose five-day run ended Sunday, is part of a series
of exhibitions, concerts, film screenings and how-to workshops on
questioning the status quo taking place around the city through
December.
	   The group and its festival go by the name ``APA,'' the word that
means ``what?'' in the Malay language but here stands for Artists
Pro-Active.
	   Organizers say the troupe of some 70 artists is non-political
but acknowledge that they heaved a sigh of relief when the play was
granted a permit. Performances in Malaysia require a City Hall and
police permit.
	   Judging by the audience, less than half the seating capacity at
a weekend show, the government risks little by tolerating the
artistic expression.
	   However, given the dozens of pro-Anwar websites, a new
popularity for alternative newspapers and unrelenting street
protests, Malaysians are searching for outlets that strike a
balance with the paternalistic words of politicians and the
government-controlled local media.
	   The crisis that began as a political battle spearheaded by
Anwar's mainly Muslim supporters is seeping into the mainstream.
Street protests see ethnic Indian and Chinese businessmen and
housewives mixing with Islamic conservatives in headscarves.
	   ``The story is no longer about Anwar Ibrahim,'' says Rehman
Rashid, who wrote ``A Malaysian Journey,'' a widely read book about
modern Malaysia. ``This is about a national revulsion.''
	   ``Malaysians are losing the last shreds of faith in their
government, its media and its instruments of authority,'' Rashid
wrote in an essay, ``The Voice of Silence,'' featured in the APA
festival.
	   In the underground theater, one skit focused on the frustrations
of speaking out.
	   Young actors with flashlights walk the darkened aisles calling
out questions: ``Truth?'' ``Malaysia?'' ``Freedom?'' ``How Much?''
Once on stage, they hurl their bodies against the concrete walls
and pound the floor.
	   ``I have sounds inside that want to come out,'' said Loh Kok
Man, who produced the piece. ``All I'm asking for is the truth.''

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ World leaders and U.N. officials faced a
new crisis with Iraq Sunday after the government announced that it
would no longer allow U.N. weapons inspectors to work in the
country.
	   The U.N. Security Council late Saturday unanimously condemned
Iraq's decision and demanded that Baghdad rescind the decision
immediately and unconditionally.
	   The council called Saturday's announcement from Baghdad ``a
flagrant violation'' of council resolutions and a memorandum of
understanding between Iraq and U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
that averted military action against Iraq in February after another
crisis over weapons inspections.
	   It reiterated the council's offer to review Iraq's compliance
with U.N. resolutions if it resumes cooperation with U.N. weapons
inspectors.
	   The decision by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and his top
advisers exempted only a handful of experts from the International
Atomic Energy Agency, who monitor suspected nuclear sites.
	   On Sunday, a four-man team from the IAEA left their headquarters
on the edge of Baghdad for a monitoring assignment, refusing to
speak to reporters. A U.N. official said other weapons monitors
would not be working. He spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Iraq's move Saturday was seen as a response to the Security
Council's decision Friday to review Iraq's progress on eliminating
prohibited weapons.
	   Although it pledged a ``comprehensive review,'' the council did
not accede to Iraq's demand that the review lead directly to the
removal of the sweeping trade sanctions imposed in 1990 after
Baghdad's forces invaded Kuwait.
	   The sanctions cannot be lifted until the Special Commission
certifies that Iraq has eliminated its weapons of mass destruction.
Iraq insists it has done so, but the commission says Baghdad
continues to hide information on weapons, especially those with
biological and chemical agents.
	   Iraq's statement issued Saturday said the ban would continue
``until the United Nations looks at the issue in an honest and
positive way, leading to Iraq's right to the lifting of the unjust
sanctions.''
	   Iraq also insisted that the Security Council fire Richard
Butler, chief of the U.N. Special Commission that oversees weapons
inspections. Iraq has long accused Butler of working on behalf of
the United States to prolong sanctions.
	   It remained unclear if Saturday's decision would provoke the
United States and Britain to threaten military action against
Baghdad, as they did earlier this year after the Iraqi regime
prevented U.N. inspectors from entering Saddam's presidential
palaces. Both U.S. and British officials condemned the move.
	   In Washington, U.S. President Bill Clinton's national security
advisers were reviewing the situation and consulting with allies
and U.N. officials, said David Leavy, a spokesman for the U.S.
National Security Council. ``We view this as a serious matter,''
Leavy said.
	   U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen canceled a weeklong Asian
tour to return to Washington and participate in U.S. administration
discussions over the new standoff with Iraq.
	   Saddam Hussein's decision caused jitters in Baghdad. Currency
traders said the already depressed Iraqi dinar fell from 1660 to
the dollar to 1760 from within minutes of the announcement.
	   Iraqi Trade Minister Mohammed Mehdi Saleh told reporters
Saturday that the country would stand firm.
	   ``This is the decision of the people of Iraq and the leadership
of Iraq to save the sovereignty of Iraq and the right of the people
to live,'' Saleh said.
	   The sanctions have severely damaged the Iraqi economy by
limiting the sale of oil, banning air travel and prohibiting most
other financial dealings with Iraq.
	   Saturday's decision deepens a dispute that began Aug. 5, when
Iraq announced that teams from the Special Commission and the
atomic agency could no longer carry out spot inspections. But Iraq
allowed both groups to continue long-term monitoring, often done
with cameras and sensors, at previously identified weapons sites.
	   The Iraqi Information Ministry issued a statement late Saturday
saying the government was not asking the roughly 120 U.N. monitors
and support staff to leave Iraq. It added that the monitoring
cameras and sensors installed at weapons sites could continue to
operate.
	   ``Iraq was disappointed because lifting of the sanctions didn't
go in a normal fashion,'' the statement said. It added that the
Security Council decision Friday had been made under ``clear
pressure from America.''

Three people killed because of power cuts in Russian Far East
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Three people have died as a result of power cuts
on the Kamchatka Peninsula in Russia's Far East, including a girl
who was killed when a flashlight exploded in her mouth, a news
agency reported Sunday.
	   A husband and wife died Thursday after a clothing iron they
forgot to turn off during a power cut caused a fire when
electricity returned, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   And a 13-year-old girl was killed Wednesday when a flashlight
she was holding in her mouth exploded while she was studying. The
girl was doing homework during a power cut, the report said.
	   All three deaths occurred in Kamchatka's capital
Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, located about 6,700 kilometers (4,200
miles) east of Moscow.
	   A number of people were also severely injured in the region
because of exploding kerosene lamps and heaters, ITAR-Tass said.
	   The peninsula is suffering a severe energy crisis because the
regional government cannot afford to buy fuel to produce enough
heat and electricity for homes and offices. Electricity is switched
on only four hours a day and heat has not yet been turned on for
the winter, even though it is already snowing in rural areas and
temperatures are around zero.
	   Lawmakers on the peninsula have sent a letter to U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan asking for urgent fuel aid to survive
the winter.
	   A number of pensioners on the peninsula offered to donate 100
rubles (six dollars) each from their meager pensions so the
government can buy fuel, ITAR-Tass said Sunday. Pensioners across
Russia receive an average of 400 rubles (dlrs 24) each month.
	   Also Sunday, Japan handed over dlrs 80,000 in humanitarian aid
for a children's hospital on Kamchatka, ITAR-Tass reported. The aid
consists of medicine and medical equipment.

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ A Dutch oil tanker flying a Maltese flag
caught fire at Beirut port Sunday but all 17 crewmen were rescued,
port officials reported.
	   One of the sailors was hospitalized with burns and respiratory
problems caused by smoke, the officials said.
	   The fire spread to a cattle ship docked nearby, but that blaze
was extinguished. The fire aboard the tanker was still burning at
mid-morning, sending a huge black cloud over the capital.
	   ``The Beirut fire brigade backed by the army is battling the
blaze with water hoses and chemicals,'' Lt. Col. Ghassan Balaa,
chief of the Beirut fire brigade, told the Associated Press. ``We
hope we will put it down this afternoon.''
	   He declined to pinpoint the cause of the fire until an
investigation was completed and insurance company reports
submitted. But port officials, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity, said the fire probably was caused by an oil slick.
	   The fire aboard the cattle boat was put out after about an hour.
The nationality of the vessel was not immediately known.

overall against only two losses since 1979.
	   The Americans beat Japan 5-4 in the first round, 6.5-2.5 in the
second and 12.5-5.5 in the final round. A victory was worth one
point and a tie one-half point.

beat Kaori Harada 69-70.
	   Japanese captain Michiko Hattori, the 1985 U.S. women's amateur
champion, shot the day's a best score, with nine birdies and one
bogey, and beat Lisa Hackney of England 64-67.
	   Hattori, who leads the 1998 Japan LPGA money earning list with
three victories, strung together four birdies in a row starting
from the second hole.
	   Other Japanese team winners were Hiromi Takamura, 69-72 over
Hiromi Kobayashi, a U.S. regular; Huang Yu-chen of Taiwan, 69-70
over Wendy Ward; Akiko Fukushima, 70-76 over Michelle Estill; and

Israeli Cabinet puts off action on peace accord
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ As Israel marked the third anniversary of the
assassination of the prime minister who launched the Mideast peace
process, its Cabinet on Sunday put off discussion of the latest
peace deal.
	   At the Cabinet meeting, ministers held a moment of silence to
remember Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who was slain three years
ago by an ultra-nationalist Jew who opposed ceding land to the
Palestinians.
	   Flags flew at half-mast and ceremonies were held across the
country in a national day of remembrance for Rabin, who was gunned
down Nov. 4, 1995. On Saturday night, about 3,000 people gathered
in a Tel Aviv square now named after Rabin to pay tribute to him.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he would not bring the
Wye River agreement, signed Oct. 23 in Washington, to his Cabinet
until after Palestinians had submitted a security document on
fighting terrorism.
	   The Palestinians said the document would be turned over to the
Americans on Monday. Netanyahu's spokesman David Bar-Illan said the
Cabinet was expected to discuss and approve the accord on Tuesday.
	   Netanyahu has said he will not begin implementing the pact,
which calls on Israel to turn over another 13.1 percent of the West
Bank, until after he gets Cabinet approval.
	   Israel was also waiting to receive clarification from the United
States on several points. The so-called letters of reassurance
address several matters, including the status of a later additional
troop pullout from the West Bank, Bar-Illan said.
	   Netanyahu also repeated Israeli calls for the arrest of Mohammed
Deif, a military leader of the radical Islamic group Hamas, in the
wake of a suicide bombing on Thursday in the Gaza Strip.
	   The attack was aimed at a busload of settler schoolchildren, but
a military jeep escorting the bus took the brunt of the blast
instead. An Israeli soldier died.
	   Also Sunday, in traditionally Arab east Jerusalem, Israeli peace
activists chained themselves to a tractor where Jewish settlers
were clearing land and preparing to build a fence. Four of the
activists were arrested.
	   The site in the Ras al Amud neighborhood of about 11,000
Palestinians was the scene of violent protests last fall when a
small group of Jewish settlers moved into a home owned by Miami
millionaire Irving Moskowitz, a benefactor of Jewish settler
causes.
	   To date, the Israeli government has held up work at the site,
citing public safety concerns. However, Israel radio reported that
over the weekend the government gave the go-ahead for the fence to
be built.
	   Palestinians object to any construction on the site, which they
consider an illegal settlement.
	   Left-wing Israeli lawmaker Nomi Chazan was among a small group
of peace activists protesting the activity. Chazan called the
settler action ``incitement and provocation,'' especially coming on
the anniversary of Rabin's death.
	   Also present was the top Palestinian representative in
Jerusalem, Faisel Husseini.

<TEXT>
	   SUZUKA, Japan (AP) _ Finnish driver Mika Hakkinen won his first
Formula One championship Sunday, capping his breakthrough season
with a victory in the Japanese Grand Prix.
	   Hakkinen, an eight-time winner this year, secured the title when
German star Michael Schumacher dropped out on the 32nd lap.
Schumacher was running third when the right rear tire on his
Ferrari exploded.
	   ``I don't even know where to start to say what I'm feeling right
now,'' said Hakkinen, who many thought would never race again after
a near-fatal crash in Australia at the end of the 1995 season.
	   ``It's taken us quite a long time at McLaren to reach this
position and when that happens you look back at what we've done
together. You think of all the hard work done by designers,
mechanics.''
	   Hakkinen led all 51 laps on the 5.864-kilometer (3.636-mile)
Suzuka Circuit. Schumacher's Ferrari teammate, Eddie Irvine,
finished second, 6.4 seconds back. McLaren's David Coulthard was
third.
	   ``It was easier than some of the racing has been in the past
this year,'' Hakkinen said.
	   Schumacher, a two-time Formula One champion, topped qualifying,
but was forced to start from the back of the field after his
Ferrari stalled on the second attempt to begin the race. On the
first attempt, Italy's Jarno Trulli stalled on the grid, forcing
officials to abort the start.
	   ``The engine stalled because the clutch did not free itself and
I do not know why,'' Schumacher said.
	   Hakkinsen said, ``They told me they are going to put him on the
back of the grid and I thought, `Wow! That's nice.'''
	   He had good reason to be pleased. Starting at the back of the
field put the German in an extremely tough position. To win the
championship, he would need to overtake 20 cars on a track known
for difficult passing, and would also need Hakkinen to finish no
better than third.
	   ``When Michael was forced to start from the back of the grid it
raised an enormous amount of pressure from me,'' Hakkinen said.
	   Still, Schumacher moved up easily to 12th after only one lap.
	   By the fifth lap, he had advanced to seventh place. But as he
moved into the heavier traffic toward the front of the field,
passing became more difficult.
	   Schumacher struggled to get ahead of sixth-place Damon Hill, at
one point narrowly avoiding rear-ending the Jordan driver. Once
past Hill, he quickly moved up to third.
	   At the front, meanwhile, Hakkinen widened his lead and was more
than 20 seconds ahead of Schumacher when the German had to drop
out.
	   ``Life goes on and now we must look forward to trying again next
season,'' said Schumacher.
	   With his German rival out, the championship belonged to
Hakkinen. And with a comfortable lead over second-place Irvine, he
slowed down.
	   ``It was no rush,'' said the 30-year-old Finn when asked why his
lap times had dropped.
	   Hakkinen finished with 100 points, 14 more than Schumacher, and
led McLaren to its eighth constructor's title. He is the second
Finn to win the title, following Williams' Keke Rosberg in 1982.
	   Schumacher, who entered the race four points behind Hakkinen,
needed to win the race and have the Finn finish third or worse to
claim the title.
	   Coulthard was third with 56 points, and Irvine fourth with 47.
McLaren had 156 points, followed by Ferrari at 133 and Williams at
38.
	   Hakkinen also talked about his 1995 crash.
	   ``It changed my life dramatically,'' he said. ``But I learned
you just have to believe in yourself.''
	   A blown rear tire on his car sent Hakkinen skidding out of
control in a corner and into the wall at more than 192 kph (120
mph). He suffered a fractured skull and was in danger of drowning
in his own blood.
	   Track doctors saved his life by performing an emergency
tracheotomy.
	   He was back on the track in 1996.

North Korea turns to South Korea for badly needed cash
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KYONG-HWA SEOK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ The business deals between North Korea
and South Korea's largest conglomerate underscore the dire economic
need of the cash-strapped communist North, analysts said Sunday.
	   Analysts in Seoul also expected the Hyundai deals to spur
wide-ranging civilian economic exchanges between the rival Korean
states, helping to ease tension on the divided peninsula.
	   Chung Ju-yung, founder and honorary chairman of the Hyundai
group, returned from a visit to North Korea Saturday, declaring
that he has Pyongyang's full approval for a series of joint venture
projects in the North.
	   ``The deal shows that North Korea, badly in need of cash, wants
to lift its economic openness to a higher level,'' said Kwon
Kyong-bok, an analyst at Naewoe Press, run by Seoul's main
intelligence organization, the Agency for National Security
Planning.
	   A key Hyundai venture is a plan to send up to 2,000 tourists a
week aboard two luxury cruise ships for a tour of Diamond Mountain,
a major attraction on the North's east coast, beginning Nov. 18.
	   Other Hyundai-North Korea deals include offshore oil
exploration, and building a power plant, a gymnasium and a ship
repair yard.
	   For the tourism project, Hyundai will pay North Korea dlrs 906
million over the next six years _ an amount that slightly exceeds
the North's 1997 exports.
	   ``For economic reasons, North Korea has to open its society even
if it involves some risks,'' said Kim Sung-chul, a researcher at
the state-funded Research Institute for National Unification.
	   North Korea's economy is in shambles, and its farms have been
hit by floods and drought in recent years. U.S. officials said up
to 2 million people might have died of hunger in the past three
years in the reclusive country, which simply has no money to feed
its 23 million people.
	   ``North Korea has known that tourism is the best way to earn
foreign currency, but it has been reluctant to push it because of
the risk that it could ideologically contaminate its people and
threaten its regime,'' Kim said.
	   ``But I believe that the North's economic situation has reached
the point where it has to put up with such foreseeable risks,'' he
added.
	   Since 1995, the U.N. relief agencies have received dlrs 359
million in international donations to help ease the North's food
crisis, only 46 percent of the target amount.
	   As foreign food aid for North Korea keeps dwindling, the
Stalinist state has had to turn to South Korean businesses for
cash, analysts in Seoul said.
	   ``As it cashes in on Hyundai, North Korea will be further
inclined to open itself to outside investment, which in turn will
help ease tension with South Korea,'' said Paek Sung-ki, a
political science professor at Kyongwon University.
	   North Korea and Hyundai also agreed to jointly drill for oil on
North Korea's west coast and, if successful, to lay an oil pipeline
to South Korea.
	   But South Korean officials are skeptical.
	   ``A small amount of oil, say, about 450 barrels a day, was found
off the North's west coast in 1996 but there are no indications
that it and other offshore or onshore fields are economically
feasible,'' said Ra Byong-sun, president of Seoul's state-run Korea
Petroleum Development Corp.
	   The Hyundai deals are the first result of the South Korean
government's ``sunshine policy'' aimed at opening up the North's
isolated society through expanded civilian contacts.
	   While shunning official contact with the Seoul government, which
it considers a U.S. ``puppet,'' North Korea is actively wooing
investment from South Korean businesses.
	   ``As shown in Hyundai's case, the sunshine policy has been
proven to be a two-way road, ultimately benefiting both sides of
Korea,'' Paek of Kyongwon University said.

Environmentalists, Democrats stage street protests

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hundreds of people marched through Hong Kong
streets Sunday, some wearing medical masks to dramatize their
complaints over air pollution, and others demanding a boost for
both democracy and the economy.
	   In one demonstration, about 400 environmentalists and their
supporters, mostly Westerners, carried posters and chanted slogans
calling for the government to do something about the territory's
severe air pollution.
	   ``We want to give people some opportunity to voice frustration
with the government's inaction on air pollution and also
demonstrate to the administration that air pollution is a big
concern of the public,'' said organizer Lisa Hopkinson.
	   Legislator Christine Loh, her hair dyed blue and green for the
occasion, led the crowd in waving posters bearing such slogans as
``Diesel is deadly'' and ``Everyone has to breathe.''
	   ``Every time a car passes me when I'm waiting for the school
bus, I start to cough because of the gas coming out of the back of
the car,'' said 8-year-old Frances Croft-Wang, who came with her
mother.
	   Shoppers in a mall paused to gaze down at the marchers, but many
did not know what they were protesting.
	   ``Maybe Westerners are more vocal,'' Hopkinson said, ``Hong Kong
people are not used to demonstrating.''
	   But on their march from downtown Hong Kong, the
environmentalists passed a demonstration organized by the main
opposition party, the Democratic Party.
	   More than 100 Democrats and their supporters urged the
territory's chief executive, Tung Chee-hwa, to do more to boost
democracy and the faltering economy.
	   The demonstrators tied a copy of Tung's October policy address
to a broom hanging above a straw waste basket to drive their point
home.
	   ``I don't think he's got any solution to offer,'' said
Democratic Party leader Martin Lee, accusing Tung of doing too
little to address two main concerns of Hong Kong people _
unemployment and wage cuts.
	   Unemployment is at a 15-year high of 5 percent and many
employers have cut wages in the past several months to try to cope
with the economic recession.
	   ``I'm not satisfied with Tung Chee-hwa. He's not as good as
Patten,'' said one a woman in her 60s who gave her name only as
Hwang. She was referring to Hong Kong's last British governor,
Chris Patten.
	   Despite concerns before the former British colony's return to
China last year, political protests remain legal, and are quite
frequent in Hong Kong.

Israeli Cabinet puts off action on peace accord
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DINA KRAFT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ As Israel marked the third anniversary of the
assassination of the prime minister who launched the Mideast peace
process, its Cabinet on Sunday put off discussion of the latest
peace deal.
	   At the Cabinet meeting, ministers held a moment of silence to
remember Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who was slain three years
ago by an ultra-nationalist Jew who opposed ceding land to the
Palestinians.
	   Flags flew at half-mast and ceremonies were held across the
country in a national day of remembrance for Rabin, who was gunned
down Nov. 4, 1995. On Saturday night, about 3,000 people gathered
in a Tel Aviv square now named after Rabin to pay tribute to him.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he would not bring the
Wye River agreement, signed Oct. 23 in Washington, to his Cabinet
until after Palestinians had submitted a security document on
fighting terrorism.
	   The Palestinians said the document would be turned over to the
Americans on Monday. Netanyahu's spokesman David Bar-Illan said the
Cabinet was expected to discuss and approve the accord on Tuesday.
	   Netanyahu has said he will not begin implementing the pact,
which calls on Israel to turn over another 13.1 percent of the West
Bank, until after he gets Cabinet approval.
	   Israel was also waiting to receive clarification from the United
States on several points. The so-called letters of reassurance
address several matters, including the status of a later additional
troop pullout from the West Bank, Bar-Illan said.
	   Netanyahu also repeated Israeli calls for the arrest of Mohammed
Deif, a military leader of the radical Islamic group Hamas, in the
wake of a suicide bombing on Thursday in the Gaza Strip.
	   The attack was aimed at a busload of settler schoolchildren, but
a military jeep escorting the bus took the brunt of the blast
instead. An Israeli soldier died.
	   Also Sunday, in traditionally Arab east Jerusalem, Israeli peace
activists chained themselves to a tractor where Jewish settlers
were clearing land and preparing to build a fence. Four of the
activists were arrested.
	   The site in the Ras al Amud neighborhood of about 11,000
Palestinians was the scene of violent protests last fall when a
small group of Jewish settlers moved into a home owned by Miami
millionaire Irving Moskowitz, a benefactor of Jewish settler
causes.
	   To date, the Israeli government has held up work at the site,
citing public safety concerns. However, Israel radio reported that
over the weekend the government gave the go-ahead for the fence to
be built.
	   Palestinians object to any construction on the site, which they
consider an illegal settlement.
	   Left-wing Israeli lawmaker Nomi Chazan was among a small group
of peace activists protesting the activity. Chazan called the
settler action ``incitement and provocation,'' especially coming on
the anniversary of Rabin's death.
	   Also present was the top Palestinian representative in
Jerusalem, Faisel Husseini.

South Korean musicians arrive in Pyongyang for joint concert
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ An 11-member South Korean orchestra
has arrived in North Korea to hold a joint concert with a northern
counterpart, North Korea's official media said Sunday.
	   It will be the first joint concert in North Korea by musicians
from the rival sides since the peninsula was divided into the
communist North and the capitalist South in 1945.
	   The two Koreas are technically in a state of war since the
1950-53 Korean War ended with an armistice, not a peace treaty.
Their border is the world's most heavily armed, with almost 2
million troops deployed on both sides.
	   Rather than cross the border, the South Korean orchestra, led by
Choe Hak-rae, secretary-general of the private Unification and
Cultural Foundation, flew into North Korea Saturday by way of
Beijing, the North's Korean Central News Agency said.
	   The concert, scheduled Tuesday, is to commemorate Yun I Sang, a
naturalized Korean-born German composer who died in Germany in
1995. He is respected in both North and South Korea.
	   ``The orchestra was cordially met at the airport by chief Kim
Jong Ho of the Yun I Sang music institute, Yun's widow, officials
concerned and others,'' KCNA said.
	   The South Korean delegation consists of singers, composers and
musicians.
	   A similar all-Korean joint concert was held in Japan in the
early 1990s.

Malaysia extends deadline for illegal aliens to leave
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The government has extended by 15
days the deadline for illegal immigrants to leave Malaysia, a news
report said.
	   A two-month amnesty period that started Aug. 31 was to have
ended Saturday night.
	   About 130,000 immigrants returned to their own countries during
the period. Of those, 104,000 were Indonesians and the rest mostly
from the Philippines, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and Myanmar.
	   The 15-day extension would be final and there would be no more
grace period, Deputy Home Minister Tajol Rosli Ghazali was quoted
as saying Saturday by Bernama news agency.
	   After the new deadline, authorities would take action against
those illegal immigrants still in Malaysia, Tajol Rosli said.
	   The government estimates there are more than 400,000 immigrant
workers in Malaysia. Some are working without work permits, for
which they could be arrested, fined and deported.
	   During Asia's boom years, Malaysia imported millions of foreign
workers to build its modern cityscape. Now, with rising
unemployment and a plunging economy, the welcome mat has been
withdrawn.

	   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) _ An opposition coalition was optimistic
it can oust Macedonia's ex-communist government as polls opened
Sunday in a second round of parliamentary elections in the young
Balkan country.
	   The outcome is important for international peace efforts for
neighboring Kosovo. NATO wants to use Macedonia as a base for
NATO's aerial missions over the province and to station a security
force to protect the 2,000-member ground verification force.
	   The opposition had questioned whether Macedonia should become
involved, even indirectly, in the Kosovo crisis. But the country is
member of NATO's Partnership for Peace and observers say that the
opposition will probably accept the NATO request.
	   More than half the legislature's 120 seats were up for grabs
after the Oct. 18 first round which left the nationalist-reformist
coalition of VMRO-DPMNE and Democratic Alternative with the
advantage.
	   If the opposition forces fail to gain an outright majority in
parliament, the country's ethnic Albanian minority may determine
whether the ruling Social Democrats remain in power, depending on
which party it chooses to ally with.
	   The Social Democrats won just 13 of the 55 seats allocated in
the first round, trailing both the opposition coalition with 21 and
the ethnic Albanians' party with 18. Three seats went to two minor
parties, with 65 left undetermined due to a turnout below the
required one-third of registered voters or, in other areas, no
clear majority.
	   Macedonia gained independence six years ago when the former
Yugoslavia broke up, and is the only ex-Yugoslav republic spared
from war. But tensions are high due to its shared border with
Serbia's Kosovo province, where hundreds have died this year in
fighting between Serbian government troops and Kosovo's ethnic
Albanian separatist guerrillas.
	   Macedonia has its own large and restive community of ethnic
Albanians _ 23 percent of the country's 2 million people. There are
fears they could take up arms to win independence for the western
part of Macedonia, where many of them live and outnumber
Macedonians.
	   Top issues during the campaign were Macedonia's feeble economy
and disputes with neighbors Bulgaria, Albania and Greece.

 &UR; Finns wake up to happy news of Hakkinen's triumph &QL; 
 &UR; By MARIUS TURULA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Auto racing fans crowded restaurants
and pubs in the early hours Sunday and got to hear and see what
they had dreamed of _ Mika Hakkinen as the new world champion in
Formula One auto racing.
	   ``People had tears in their eyes, and the roof nearly blew
off,'' said Tarja Timonen, a restaurant waitress. ``I myself had
goose pimples.''
	   It's no wonder, because Timonen works at Allun Grilli, owned by
Hakkinen's first private sponsor Aarno Kotilainen, and frequented
by the new champion's father, Harri.
	   More than 200 people crammed into the 144-seat restaurant on the
outskirts of Helsinki, near Hakkinen's childhood home. The walls
are covered with an array of Hakkinen memorabilia: his overalls,
helmets, trophies, and dozens of photographs.
	   ``The bubbly was all ready and chilled. Mika's parents Aila and
Harri had said they would treat everybody (in the restaurant) to
champagne, although they weren't here themselves,'' Timonen said.
	   Allun Grilli was one of several restaurants and pubs which
applied for a special license to open at 5 a.m. and serve mild
alcoholic drinks.
	   Despite the early morning hour, TV viewers got up to watch live
coverage of the Grand Prix from Japan which began at 5:35 a.m.
(0335GMT).
	   The previous race, which was also important for the final result
of the championship, attracted more than 1.3 million viewers in a
country of 5 million people. It even topped the main evening
newscast, which normally draws more than a million viewers.
	   Some were up hours before the race began.
	   ``I was too excited to sleep, and so nervous,'' said Osmo
Korhonen, who has watched every Grand Prix race live with his wife
on Finnish TV, irrespective of the hour.
	   ``It's a great day for Finland. Hakkinen did a fine job. It's so
fantastic,'' said Korhonen, 43, a postal worker.
	   Finland's previous Formula One champion from 1982 and Hakkinen's
mentor, Keke Rosberg, commented on the race for Finland's main
commercial TV channel, MTV3. The broadcast ended with a leading
men's choir singing the words to a nationalistic march played after
major sporting triumphs and during official events.
	   In downtown Helsinki, fans gathered at Planet Hollywood
chanting, ``Mika is the new world champion'' in Finnish to the tune
of the Beatles' song ``Yellow Submarine.''
	   At Allun Grilli, whole families gathered to watch the race.
	   ``With Mika winning, it was a mighty experience for the kids,''
Timonen said over the roar of singing and chanting in honor of the
neighborhood boy who made it to the top.

Connors defends Tokyo title
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Defending champion Jimmy Connors of the United
States beat Andres Gomez of Ecuador 6-2, 6-3 Sunday and won the
dlrs 150,000 NTT Data Champions Tennis, his sixth triumph on the
senior circuit this season.
	   The 46-year-old Connors needed just one hour and 13 minutes to
win the dlrs 40,000 title before more than 5,000 spectators at the
Ariake Colosseum. He now has won this tournament three times.
	   ``Since Gomez was in good shape, I thought I could beat him only
with my best play,'' said Connors, who was No. 1 in the world for
five years in a row on the regular men's tour.
	   ``I had a chance to win, but Connors caught my ball well and hit
back to the corners,'' said the 38-year-old Gomez, the 1990 French
Open champion.
	   Gomez collected dlrs 25,000 for his singles runner-up finish,
and joined with American Mel Purcell to win the dlrs 11,500 doubles
first prize. In the final, they beat Mansour Bahrami of France and
American Peter Fleming 4-6, 7-5, 13-11, using a tie-break format
after one set all.
	   The 21-tournament senior tennis circuit now moves to Zagreb,
Croatia, for the 17th leg Nov. 13-16.

U.N., world leaders prepare for new showdown with Iraq
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Iraqi vice president's statement, editorials.
 &UR; By EILEEN ALT POWELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ A defiant Iraq said Sunday it would not
back down from its decision to ban U.N. weapons inspectors from
working in the country, even if military action were threatened.
	   Vice President Taha Hussein Ramadan said in a speech opening a
trade fair here that ``there will be no cooperation (with the
inspectors) before Iraq's demands are met'' and that the country
would maintain this stance ``until the sanctions are lifted.''
	   His comments came the morning after the U.N. Security Council
issued a statement condemning Iraq's decision Saturday to cut off
all dealings with arms inspectors as ``a flagrant violation'' of
U.N. resolutions.
	   The council also repeated its offer to review Iraq's compliance
with U.N. resolutions if it resumes cooperation with U.N. weapons
inspectors.
	   ``Iraq rejects the latest U.N. Security Council statement and
will not back down,'' Ramadan told reporters at the trade fair.
	   Asked about the possibility of military action to force Iraq to
cooperate, he said: ``Iraq does not fear the threat of the United
States because it has been threatening Iraq for the past eight
years.''
	   Iraq's decision halts all activities of the U.N. Special
Commission _ which is charged with eliminating Iraq's chemical and
biological weapons as well as long-range missiles _ in Iraq.
	   In effect, that means stopping U.N. monitors from visiting
already inspected weapons sites, which was allowed to continue when
Iraq stopped inspections of new suspected arms-making sites in
August.
	   The decision exempted monitoring by the Vienna-headquartered
International Atomic Energy Agency, which is charged with
eliminating nuclear weapons.
	   On Sunday, a four-man team from the IAEA left their headquarters
on the edge of Baghdad for a monitoring assignment, refusing to
speak to reporters. A U.N. official said other weapons monitors
would not be working. He spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   The sanctions, imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait,
limit the sale of oil and other trade activities and have
devastated Iraq's economy, turning a once-prosperous nation into a
country of paupers.
	   The sanctions cannot be lifted until the U.N. inspectors certify
that Iraq has eliminated its weapons of mass destruction. Iraq
insists it has done so, but the commission says Baghdad continues
to hide information, especially about biological and chemical
weapons.
	   Iraq's statement Saturday said the ban on U.N. inspections would
continue ``until the United Nations looks at the issue in an honest
and positive way, leading to Iraq's right to the lifting of the
unjust sanctions.''
	   Iraq also insisted that the Security Council fire Richard
Butler, chief of the U.N. Special Commission that oversees weapons
inspections. Iraq has long accused Butler of working on behalf of
the United States to prolong sanctions.
	   It was unclear if Saturday's decision would provoke the United
States and Britain to threaten military action against Baghdad, as
they did earlier this year after Iraq prevented U.N. inspectors
from entering Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's presidential palaces.
	   Both U.S. and British officials condemned Iraq's latest move.
	   In Washington, U.S. President Bill Clinton's national security
advisers were reviewing the situation and consulting with allies
and U.N. officials, said David Leavy, a spokesman for the U.S.
National Security Council.
	   U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen canceled a weeklong Asian
tour to return to Washington and participate in U.S. administration
discussions over the new standoff with Iraq.
	   Saddam's decision caused jitters in Baghdad. Currency traders
said the already depressed Iraqi dinar fell from 1660 to the dollar
to 1760 from within minutes of the announcement. Trading opened at
1720 on Sunday.
	   The Iraqi Information Ministry issued a statement late Saturday
saying the government was not asking the roughly 120 U.N. monitors
and support staff to leave Iraq. It added that the monitoring
cameras and sensors installed at weapons sites could continue to
operate.

Seven killed in brawl in Indonesian town
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Two groups with a longstanding land
dispute brawled for three hours in an Indonesian town, leaving at
least seven people dead, the official Antara news agency reported
Sunday.
	   Six other people were severely injured and 30 houses were
damaged in the brawl early Saturday in the West Nusa Tenggara
provincial capital of Mataram, Antara said. Mataram, on Lombok
Island, is about 1,000 kilometers (625 miles) east of Jakarta.
	   Antara quoted Maj. Dahlan Endjang, a spokesman of the local
police, as saying it was the second brawl between the two groups
since Wednesday, when one man was killed.
	   The main cause of the brawl was still being investigated, but
police said the two groups long have disputed a piece of land for a
cemetery.
	   At least 40 people were being interrogated but there had been no
arrests so far, Antara said.

Butcher hurt as England digs in
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PERTH, Australia (AP) _ England opener Mark Butcher became the
latest Ashes tour casualty Sunday when he was hit on the head in
the match against Western Australia.
	   Butcher needed 10 stitches in a cut over his right eye after
being hit from the second ball of England's innings. While he may
be able to return to bat later in the innings, it was a further
jolt to a side missing top batsmen Alec Stewart and Mike Atherton
through injury.
	   Western Australia declared its innings at 334 for eight on the
second day of the four-day game and England was 191 for two in
reply at stumps. Acting captain Nasser Hussain scored a fine
unbeaten 93 and Mark Ramprakash was 42.
	   Butcher's injury, which happened when he ducked into a ball
which barely rose above hip height, continued a run of bad luck for
England in Perth. England coach Graham Gooch said Butcher misjudged
the bounce.
	   ``Unfortunately on the last two or three tours (to Australia),
in Perth fate has not been with us and we have had a few
injuries,'' Gooch said. ``I was injured in 1990 here and Alec
Stewart broke a finger last time and now we have had another slight
hiccup.''
	   The injury woes to England's batsmen overshadowed Hussain's
elegant innings and an aggressive 42 from Graham Thorpe, who struck
five boundaries from seven balls just before tea.

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Auto racing fans crowded restaurants
and pubs in the early hours Sunday and got to hear and see what
they had dreamed of _ Mika Hakkinen as the new world champion in
Formula One auto racing.
	   ``People had tears in their eyes, and the roof nearly blew
off,'' said Tarja Timonen, a restaurant waitress. ``I myself had
goose pimples.''
	   It's no wonder, because Timonen works at Allun Grilli, owned by
Hakkinen's first private sponsor Aarno Kotilainen, and frequented
by the new champion's father, Harri.
	   More than 200 people crammed into the 144-seat restaurant on the
outskirts of Helsinki, near Hakkinen's childhood home. The walls
are covered with an array of Hakkinen memorabilia: his overalls,
helmets, trophies, and dozens of photographs.
	   ``The bubbly was all ready and chilled. Mika's parents Aila and
Harri had said they would treat everybody (in the restaurant) to
champagne, although they weren't here themselves,'' Timonen said.
	   Allun Grilli was one of several restaurants and pubs which
applied for a special license to open at 5 a.m. and serve mild
alcoholic drinks.
	   Despite the early morning hour, TV viewers got up to watch live
coverage of the Grand Prix from Japan which began at 5:35 a.m.
(0335GMT).
	   The previous race, which was also important for the final result
of the championship, attracted more than 1.3 million viewers in a
country of 5 million people. It even topped the main evening
newscast, which normally draws more than a million viewers.
	   Some were up hours before the race began.
	   ``I was too excited to sleep, and so nervous,'' said Osmo
Korhonen, who has watched every Grand Prix race this season live
with his wife on Finnish TV, irrespective of the hour.
	   ``It's a great day for Finland. Hakkinen did a fine job. It's so
fantastic,'' said Korhonen, 43, a postal worker.
	   Finland's previous Formula One champion from 1982 and Hakkinen's
mentor, Keke Rosberg, commented on the race for Finland's main
commercial TV channel, MTV3. The broadcast ended with a leading
men's choir singing the words to a nationalistic march played after
major sporting triumphs and during official events.
	   In downtown Helsinki, fans gathered at Planet Hollywood
chanting, ``Mika is the new world champion'' in Finnish to the tune
of the Beatles' song ``Yellow Submarine.''
	   At Allun Grilli, whole families gathered to watch the race.
	   ``With Mika winning, it was a mighty experience for the kids,''
Timonen said over the roar of singing and chanting in honor of the
neighborhood boy who made it to the top.

Taiwanese foreign minister reportedly visiting Middle East
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Foreign Minister Jason Hu is on an
impromptu visit to the Middle East as Taiwan's diplomatic row with
China heats up again, a newspaper reported Sunday.
	   Hu visited Bahrain and may also travel to Jordan and the United
Arab Emirates, the United Evening News reported.
	   Foreign Ministry officials were unavailable for comment.
	   Also Sunday, the United Daily News reported that Premier Vincent
Siew held discussions with Singapore Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew
early Saturday at Taiwan's main international airport. Siew refused
to confirm or deny the meeting.
	   Neither Singapore or any nation in the Middle East has
diplomatic relations with Taiwan in deference to China, which
considers Taiwan a breakaway province without any right to
international recognition.
	   Taiwan is the seat of the Nationalist government driven off
China's mainland by Communist forces in 1949.
	   On Friday, Tonga became the latest country to desert Taipei for
Beijing, leaving just 26 nations that still officially recognize
Taiwan, mostly poor nations in Africa, Central America and the
Caribbean. Many nations, however, have active unofficial relations
with Taiwan.
	   Tonga's defection signaled that China plans no letup in its
campaign to deprive Taiwan of all diplomatic allies by 2000, even
as the two move to improve their relations. Top negotiators from
the two sides met in China last month, the highest-level contact
between them since Beijing froze negotiations in 1995 in anger over
Taiwan's bid for greater international recognition.

Susan Rice calls for talks to end Congolese war
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ The United States' top official for
Africa urged Congo's President Laurent Kabila to resolve Congo's
civil war at the diplomatic table and prevent another genocide in
the region, state radio reported Sunday.
	   Susan Rice, Under Secretary of State for African Affairs, led a
team of U.S. officials who spoke with Kabila for more than four
hours on Saturday, the state-run broadcaster reported.
	   At least four African countries _ Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia and
Chad _ have sent troops in support of Congo's government while
Uganda and Rwanda are backing the rebels.
	   ``We expressed our great concern about the specter of ethnic
violence which is resurfacing in this part of the world. There is a
risk that this violence will degenerate into another genocide,''
Rice told the radio station.
	   She was referring to the 1994 genocide in Rwandan in which more
than 500,000 people, mainly ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus were
killed by Rwandan Hutu extremists.
	   Rice described the talks with Kabila as positive, and said the
United States was urging both parties in the three-month rebel war
to resolve their differences diplomatically and preserve Congo's
sovereignty while respecting human rights.
	   ``There is the the need to find a peaceful and non-military
solution to the conflict ... We stressed the need for a diplomatic
solution to the crisis taking into account the views of all the
countries implicated in the conflict.''
	   Rice arrived in Congo's capital with a Washington delegation on
Friday and left the country Saturday evening for a visit to several
other African countries, including Rwanda and Uganda on Tuesday and
Wednesday.
	   Kabila accuses Rwanda and Uganda manipulating the rebels, a
coalition of ethnic Tutsi fighters, former Congolese soldiers and
disgruntled Kabila supporters who control a swath of territory in
the east.
	   The two countries backed Kabila's own rebellion that began in
late 1996 and ended in the ouster of the late Zairian dictator
Mobutu Sese Seko in May last year.
	   Rwanda and Uganda say they are merely defending their own
security interests in Congolese territory.
	   Both countries accuse Kabila of harboring Rwandan Hutu rebels
who have launched raids into Rwanda from across the border in
eastern Congo. The Rwandan rebels are widely blamed for the 1994
genocide in Rwanda in which more than 500,000 people, mostly ethnic
Tutsis were killed.

Red Cross sends help to raided Kenyans
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ The Red Cross on Sunday sent aid workers
and a 10-ton truck loaded with food and medicine to northeastern
Kenya where at least 160 people were killed in raids.
	   The Red Cross will identify the locations and needs of those
displaced by fighting, and check hospitals for wounded, spokeswoman
Nina Galbe said.
	   If necessary, more aid will be provided and seriously wounded
people will be flown to the Red Cross's 560-bed hospital in
northwestern Lokichokio, she said.
	   The Daily Nation said 160 people were killed about 50 young
girls abducted by the raiders who also stole an estimated 17,000
goats, cattle and camels.
	   The raids were on Budada, Gerari, Tuli and Mudama villages about
200 kilometers (125 miles) west of Wajir town, the provincial
capital.
	   Wajir, 500 kilometers (310 miles) northeast of Nairobi, is in a
dry, desolate region where cattle raids and clan-based clashes over
the use of scarce water and wells are common.
	   The government alleges Kenya's Boran ethnic group enlisted the
Oromo Liberation Front, a rebel group from neighboring Ethiopia, to
attack members of the Kenyan Somali Degodia clan.
	   The Ethiopian government has denied Oromos were involved.
	   The Red Cross has been assisting thousands of people who have
been uprooted in clashes earlier this year in the region.

Record high 72 people sentenced to death in October
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with group saying figure was the largest in one month
since death law was reimposed, 3rd graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine courts sentenced a record
72 people to death last month, mostly on rape convictions, bringing
to 820 the number of death row convicts since capital punishment
was restored in 1994, an anti-crime group said Sunday.
	   Among those sentenced to death was a British man convicted of
raping his 12-year-old stepdaughter and a police official who
kidnapped and killed a businesswoman, the Citizens' Drugwatch
Foundation said.
	   Of the 72, the largest number of people to be sentenced to death
in one month, 37 were convicted of rape, 16 of kidnapping, 11 of
murder and eight of robbery with homicide, said the foundation. The
group is composed mostly of Philippine lawmakers fighting crime.
	   The 1987 constitution abolished the death penalty but gave
Congress the option to restore it for crimes such as murder,
kidnappings for ransom, rape and drug trafficking.
	   A law that brought back capital punishment took effect in 1994.
Its return has triggered debates that have divided many Filipinos.
	   Prison authorities said they are waiting for a lower court to
set the date for the execution by lethal injection of Leo
Echegaray, the first convict to be scheduled for execution under
the 1994 law.
	   Echegaray, a poor house painter, was convicted of repeatedly
raping his 10-year-old stepdaughter.
	   Sen. Loren Legarda, a member of the foundation, said that among
those sentenced to death last month were 11 people, including three
women, who kidnapped an elderly fish trader in a Manila suburb.
	   Also sentenced to death was Albert Ernest Wilson of Kent,
England, who was convicted of raping the daughter of his common-law
Filipino wife in suburban Valenzuela in metropolitan Manila.
	   Wilson, 46, became the 11th foreigner to be sent to death row.
	   A police chief inspector and an air force serviceman were also
sentenced to death for kidnapping and later killing a businesswoman
in the central Philippines.
	   Legarda said 459 of those on death row were convicted of rape,
and 159 of those abused their children or other relatives.
	   Many Filipinos favor the return of the death penalty, arguing it
can deter crimes such as rape and kidnapping. Roman Catholic
bishops and other civic groups, however, oppose it, saying there is
no proof of this.
	   Opponents also say the poor are disadvantaged because they
cannot afford good lawyers for their defense.

Two ships catch fire in Beirut port, one blaze extinguished

 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with details from official of oil company official. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ An oil tanker flying the Maltese flag
caught fire at Beirut port Sunday but the vessel's crew was
rescued, port officials reported.
	   One of the sailors from the tanker Giovanna was hospitalized
with burns and respiratory problems caused by smoke, the officials
said. The officials said a Lebanese fisherman also suffered burns
when he jumped from his boat in panic.
	   The fire spread to a cattle ship docked nearby, but that blaze
was extinguished. The fire aboard the tanker was still burning in
the early afternoon, sending a huge black cloud over the capital.
	   ``The Beirut fire brigade backed by the army is battling the
blaze with water hoses and chemicals,'' Lt. Col. Ghassan Balaa,
chief of the Beirut fire brigade, told the Associated Press.
	   Salim Ramadan, marketing manager of the Coral Oil Company, a
Lebanese oil distribution firm which contracted for the oil aboard
the tanker, said it carried a 24-man crew of Greeks, Dutch, Poles
and Italians.
	   He identified the ship as the Giovanna and told The Associated
Press that some 11,000 tons of oil was emptied out of the tanker
before the fire started about 5 a.m. (0300gmt) Sunday.
	   ``A lot of the cargo ... is still intact. From the time and
quantity being burned, I can tell it's not more than 3,000 tons,''
he said. He said it was hoped the blaze could be put out during
Sunday afternoon.
	   Neither Ramadan nor Balaa would say what caused the blaze. But
port officials, speaking on customary condition of anonymity, said
the fire probably started from an oil slick.
	   The fire aboard the cattle boat was put out after about an hour.
The identity of that vessel was not immediately known.

Newspaper criticizes King Sihanouk as Khmer Rouge founder
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KER MUNTHIT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ A newspaper that supports strongman
Hun Sen printed rare and stinging criticism of King Norodom
Sihanouk on Sunday, holding him responsible for the birth of the
murderous Khmer Rouge regime of the mid-1970s.
	   The criticism came one day after Sihanouk celebrated his 76th
birthday. It also countered calls by those who want Hun Sen held
accountable for crimes committed under the 1975-79 Khmer Rouge
rule.
	   Hun Sen served as a commander in the ultra-Marxist group, but
then defected to the Vietnamese, who invaded Cambodia in late 1978
to topple the Khmer Rouge.
	   ``As a matter of fact, Cambodian people throughout the country
knew very well that the person who founded the Khmer Rouge movement
was Sihanouk,'' said the article in Damnoeng Thmei (New News).
	   ``Don't forget the outstanding achievements of our king,'' read
the article's sarcastic headline.
	   The article mirrored the deep rifts on the Cambodian political
scene, where Hun Sen is pitted against a political party headed by
Sihanouk's son, Prince Norodom Ranariddh.
	   Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party won general elections in
July, but without the necessary majority to form a government.
Attempts at a coalition with Ranariddh have thus far failed.
	   The newspaper printed photos of Sihanouk and his wife, Queen
Monineath, dressed in Khmer Rouge-style outfits and posing
alongside the late Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot and figurehead chief
Khieu Samphan.
	   Sihanouk ruled Cambodia until 1970, when he was overthrown by
Lon Nol in a coup backed by the United States.
	   Exiled to China, he appealed for a resistance movement to fight
Lon Nol's republic.
	   The appeals attracted thousands of Cambodians who fought with
the Khmer Rouge and succeeded in overthrowing Lon Nol in 1975.
	   During Pol Pot's reign of terror, Sihanouk was placed under
house arrest. As many as 2 million people, including many of the
king's children and relatives, were executed or died of starvation,
illness or hard labor.
	   Hun Sen has been a key figure in Cambodian politics for nearly
two decades, but his political opponents have embarked on a
campaign to have him implicated in Khmer Rouge crimes and other
human rights abuses.
	   ``Accusing Hun Sen of being a Khmer Rouge leader is totally
wrong. Instead, it was the king,'' the newspaper article said.
	   A group of international experts is expected to arrive in
Cambodia Nov. 16 to examine evidence for bringing to justice those
responsible for crimes committed during the Khmer Rouge era.
	   Sihanouk, now a constitutional monarch with few formal powers,
remains at center stage of Cambodian politics because of the
respect he commands. He has said he supports bringing Khmer Rouge
criminals before an international tribunal.

Cyprus settlement impossible if linked to EU talks, minister says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LARNACA, Cyprus (AP) - A settlement of the Cyprus problem will
become impossible if it is linked to the island's talks on joining
the European Union, the Cypriot foreign minister said Sunday.
	   Such a move ``will give Turkey a veto to decide if and when
Cyprus will join the EU. It will offer Ankara an additional reason
to be intransigent in the search for a settlement,'' Yiannakis
Cassoulides explained.
	   He was addressing reporters at Larnaca Airport as he departed
for a tour of European capitals before the formal opening of
substantive negotiations on Cyprus joining the EU _ known formally
as ``accession'' talks _ in Brussels on Nov. 8.
	   France and some other EU members objected to the start of the
talks with Cyprus at the same time as with five prospective East
European members. They argue Cyprus cannot join the EU before the
island is reunited.
	   ``If the Cyprus problem and the EU accession course are
officially associated, this would constitute an invitation to
Turkey not to allow a settlement,'' Cassoulides said.
	   Cyprus has been split into a Greek Cypriot-controlled south and
a Turkish-occupied north since Turkey invaded and occupied its
northern third in 1974 after an abortive coup by supporters of
union with Greece.
	   A breakaway Turkish Cypriot state in the north is only
recognized by Ankara, which keeps 35,000 troops there.
	   Turkey and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash are opposed to
Cyprus' entry to the EU before Turkey itself is admitted, a
development unlikely for many years.
	   U.N.-sponsored negotiations for the island's reunification have
been blocked since August last year when Denktash walked out,
demanding cancellation of the Cyprus-EU accession talks and
recognition of his breakaway state as conditions for his return.

Taiwanese politician apologizes for flinging piglets at governor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ An opposition candidate in next month's
legislative election apologized Sunday for flinging live piglets at
aides to Taiwan Governor James Soong.
	   Hsu I-sheng of the Democratic Progressive Party told reporters
that the incident last week, part of a campaign stunt, had been a
``rash act.''
	   ``I apologize for this incident to all the pigs of the world,''
Hsu said in remarks broadcast over the TVBS cable television news
network.
	   Hsu and his supporters grabbed the piglets and threw them
several meters (yards) across a parking lot at Soong's retinue
during a protest outside a hall where Soong was appearing.
	   Hsu had accused Soong of wasting taxpayers' money to nurture his
own political ambitions. The fate of the piglets was unknown.
	   Native Taiwanese sometimes insultingly refer to immigrants from
the Chinese mainland _ among whom Soong is a prominent figure _ as
``Chinese pigs.''
	   Ethnic differences rise to the surface during elections, and
Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian raised controversy last month when he
accused his Chinese-born rival, Ma Ying-jeou of the ruling
Nationalists, of being part of a conspiracy to sell out Taiwan to
China.
	   Chen is seeking re-election in the Dec. 5 election.
	   Hsu and Chen are members of the Taiwanese majority whose
ancestors immigrated from China's Fujian and Guangdong provinces up
to hundreds of years ago.
	   A large influx of mainlanders came with Chiang Kai-shek's
Nationalists in 1949 when they fled the Communist takeover of most
of China and set up their government in Taiwan.
	   Hsu's piglet-throwing protest, captured by television cameras,
prompted a counter-protest by animal rights supporters outside the
DPP's central headquarters in Taipei.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ As Israel marked the third anniversary of the
assassination of the prime minister who launched the Mideast peace
process, its Cabinet on Sunday put off discussion of the latest
peace deal.
	   At the Cabinet meeting, ministers held a moment of silence to
remember Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who was slain three years
ago by an ultra-nationalist Jew who opposed ceding land to the
Palestinians.
	   Flags flew at half-mast and ceremonies were held across the
country in a national day of remembrance for Rabin, who was gunned
down Nov. 4, 1995. On Saturday night, about 300,000 people gathered
in a Tel Aviv square now named after Rabin to pay tribute to him.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he would not bring the
Wye River agreement, signed Oct. 23 in Washington, to his Cabinet
until after Palestinians had submitted a security document on
fighting terrorism.
	   The Palestinians said the document would be turned over to the
Americans on Monday. Netanyahu's spokesman David Bar-Illan said the
Cabinet was expected to discuss and approve the accord on Tuesday.
	   Netanyahu has said he will not begin implementing the pact,
which calls on Israel to turn over another 13.1 percent of the West
Bank, until after he gets Cabinet approval.
	   His security Cabinet, however, did meet to discuss the accord's
implementation and the scheduled arrival of U.S. Middle East envoy
Dennis Ross, Israel Radio reported.
	   Israel was also waiting to receive clarification from the United
States on several points. The so-called letters of reassurance
address several matters, including the status of a later additional
troop pullout from the West Bank, Bar-Illan said.
	   Netanyahu also repeated Israeli calls for the arrest of Mohammed
Deif, a military leader of the radical Islamic group Hamas, in the
wake of a suicide bombing on Thursday in the Gaza Strip.
	   The Gaza Strip's head of security, Abdel Razak Majaydeh, said
the Palestinian Authority was working to apprehend Deif, Israel
Radio reported. Deif is believed to have been behind several deadly
attacks against Israelis and to have been hiding in Gaza for the
past three years.
	   Thursday's suicide attack was aimed at a busload of settler
schoolchildren, but a military jeep escorting the bus took the
brunt of the blast instead. An Israeli soldier died.
	   Israel's military chief-of-staff and the head of the Shin Bet
security service internal met with top Palestinian security
officials Saturday in an effort to coordinate efforts, Israel Radio
reported.
	   Also Sunday, in traditionally Arab east Jerusalem, Israeli peace
activists chained themselves to a tractor where Jewish settlers
were clearing land and preparing to build a fence. Four of the
peace activists were arrested.
	   The site in the Ras al Amud neighborhood of about 11,000
Palestinians was the scene of violent protests last fall when a
small group of Jewish settlers moved into a home owned by Miami
millionaire Irving Moskowitz, a benefactor of Jewish settler
causes.
	   To date, the Israeli government has held up work at the site,
citing public safety concerns. However, Israel radio reported that
over the weekend the government gave the go-ahead for the fence to
be built.
	   Palestinians object to any construction on the site, which they
consider an illegal settlement.
	   Left-wing Israeli lawmaker Nomi Chazan was among the small group
of peace activists protesting the activity. Chazan called the
settler action ``incitement and provocation,'' especially coming on
the anniversary of Rabin's death.
	   Also present was the top Palestinian representative in
Jerusalem, Faisel Husseini.

Three soldiers and a civilian killed in East Timor

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Assailants killed three soldiers and a
civilian in the disputed territory of East Timor, Indonesia's
official Antara news agency reported Sunday. A fourth soldier was
missing and believed killed.
	   The military blamed pro-independence activists in the stabbing
deaths Friday night of two soldiers and a civilian in Weberek, 40
kilometers (25 miles) southeast of Dili, the capital of East Timor.
	   Also Friday, masked men shot and killed a soldier in his home in
Leorama, west of Dili, the military said. There were no arrests.
	   The killings came after several months of relative calm in East
Timor's long-running guerrilla war, which broke out in 1975 when
Indonesian forces invaded the former Portuguese colony.
	   The head of East Timor's military, Col. Suhartono Suratman, said
two pistols that the victims in Weberek had been carrying were
missing. Another soldier who was with them was believed killed but
his body had not been found, he said.
	   Citing witness reports, Suratman alleged they were killed by
demonstrators who attended a rally organized by the Solidarity
Council of Students and Youths, a group that wants a referendum on
independence.
	   Indonesia has ruled out the demand, offering instead a measure
of autonomy in exchange for recognition of Indonesian sovereignty
and the release of jailed East Timorese rebel leader Xanana Gusmao.
	   The army sergeant who was killed in Leorama, Josep Florindo
Pereira, had just returned home from a service at a Roman Catholic
church with his wife, Antara said.
	   Witnesses said two men shot him in the shoulder and abdomen
while he and two other congregation members counted donations
collected during the service. A total of 10 assailants had
surrounded the house of the East Timorese native, Antara added.
	   The killings occurred amid reports that the number of Indonesian
troops in East Timor was more than 20,000, far in excess of the
number claimed by the Indonesian government.
	   The Indonesian military has said there are 15,000 soldiers in
East Timor, including 5,000 troops engaged in community work such
as health care and engineering.
	   Indonesia annexed East Timor in 1976, a year after intervening
in a civil war. The United Nations does not recognize Indonesian
rule and is sponsoring peace talks between Indonesia and Portugal,
the former colonial master.

Angry consumers raid warehouses for onions, salt
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JAIDEEP MAZUMDAR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LUCKNOW, India (AP) _ Thousands of angry consumers stormed
warehouses and shops across northern India over the weekend in
search of hoarded onions, salt and potatoes as the prices of those
foods skyrocketed.
	   A shortage of onions resulting in a jump in prices from eight
rupees (20 cents) a kilogram to as high as 100 rupees (dlrs 2.38)
in some towns has been blamed on poor crops and hoarding by
wholesalers. In response to the unrest Saturday night and Sunday in
five Uttar Pradesh towns, the state's food commissioner on Sunday
shifted most of the blame to hoarders.
	   ``There is no shortage of salt, onions, potatoes or any other
commodity or vegetable in the state,'' commissioner Kush Verma
said. ``Unscrupulous traders are hoarding some commodities, thereby
creating an artificial shortage and hiking up the prices. Stern
action is being taken against them and the situation is expected to
normalize over the next two to three days.''
	   The state government ordered raids on several warehouses
Saturday night, and trading licenses were withdrawn from owners
accused of hoarding, according to an official statement. The
statement added that some merchants were charged in court with
spreading false rumors of a salt shortage.
	   Prices of other foods have risen, but not as much as those of
the onions so important to so many Indian dishes, particularly in
the north. To add to the tension, rumors were spreading in Uttar
Pradesh of a salt shortage, resulting in panic buying and prices
rising from 2.50 rupees (about six U.S. cents) a kilogram to as
high as 50 rupees (about dlrs 1.20) a kilogram.
	   A government spokesman said police had to intervene at Etawab,
280 kilometers (174 miles) southeast of New Delhi to quell a crowd
of thousands that looted three onion warehouses Sunday morning.
Similar trouble was reported Saturday and Sunday from Allahabad,
570 kilometers (356 miles) southeast of New Delhi; Muzzafarnagar,
120 kilometers (74 miles) north of New Delhi; Bahraich, 440
kilometers (273 miles) east of New Delhi; and Varanasi, 670
kilometers (415 miles) southeast of the federal capital.
	   The federal government on Saturday had promised to get food
prices under control, announcing the abolition of import duties on
certain foods and steps to ensure surplus foods in some states were
transferred to those with shortages, and calling on state
governments to crack down on hoarders.

Bulgaria protests against Macedonian ban on Bulgarian journalists
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Macedonia-Elections &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Bulgarian officials Sunday protested the
refusal by Macedonia to allow several Bulgarian journalists to
cover the second round of general elections underway in the former
Yugoslav republic.
	   Marinela Mircheva, a state radio journalist, and Antoaneta
Maskrachka from the popular newspaper 24 Chassa, were denied entry
in Macedonia, although the Bulgarians said both had the necessary
accreditations.
	   Speaking on the state radio, Bulgaria's ambassador to Macedonia,
Angel Dimitrov, called the refusal ``a political challenge'' and
``police arbitrariness.''
	   He added the ban on Bulgarian journalists could indicate that
the current Macedonian government of Prime Minister Branco
Crvenkovski intends ``to block relations with Bulgaria if it
remains in power.''
	   Mircheva said border officials gave no ``plausible reasons'' for
refusing to let her into the country. She quoted a Macedonian
border official as saying he acted Sunday ``upon an order from
Skopje,'' the capital.
	   Mircheva said border officials had a list of Bulgarian
journalists, who were banned from entering the country until the
elections are over later Sunday.
	   24 Chassa reported Sunday that Maskrachka and Krasimir Uzunov, a
Bulgarian Balkan expert, were temporarily detained and questioned
Friday at the Macedonian border crossing of Deve Bair. Both
Bulgarians were searched and copies of articles and notes they
carried were confiscated. Maskrachka was refused entry once again
on Saturday.
	   Bulgarian media have repeatedly reported that Crvenkovsi's party
is ``waging a wild anti-Bulgarian campaign'' an accusing the
opposition of willing to sell Macedonia's interests to Sofia.
	   Bulgaria was the first country to recognize Macedonia when in
seceded from former Yugoslavia in 1991. Bulgarian imports helped
Macedonians later survive trade sanctions by neighboring Greece,
prompted by historical disputes.
	   But relations between Bulgaria and Macedonia have cooled over a
language dispute that has stalled signing bilateral accords. The
Macedonians want the documents signed ``in Macedonian and in
Bulgarian''. Bulgaria refuses to recognize the existence of a
Macedonian language, which it considers a form of Bulgarian.
	   Many ordinary Bulgarians consider Macedonians as their ethnic
kinsmen. The Slavic languages are so close that speakers of each
can usually understand the other without an interpreter.
	   Bulgaria has repeatedly stated it has no territorial claims to
Macedonia.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ As Israel marked the third anniversary of the
assassination of the prime minister who launched the Mideast peace
process, its Cabinet on Sunday put off discussion of the latest
peace deal.
	   At the Cabinet meeting, ministers held a moment of silence to
remember Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who was slain three years
ago by an ultra-nationalist Jew who opposed ceding land to the
Palestinians.
	   Flags flew at half-mast and ceremonies were held across the
country in a national day of remembrance for Rabin, who was gunned
down Nov. 4, 1995. On Saturday night, about 300,000 people gathered
in a Tel Aviv square now named after Rabin to pay tribute to him.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he would not bring the
Wye River agreement, signed Oct. 23 in Washington, to his Cabinet
until after Palestinians had submitted a security document on
fighting terrorism.
	   The Palestinians said the document would be turned over to the
Americans on Monday. Netanyahu's spokesman David Bar-Illan said the
Cabinet was expected to discuss and approve the accord on Tuesday.
	   Netanyahu has said he will not begin implementing the pact,
which calls on Israel to turn over another 13.1 percent of the West
Bank, until after he gets Cabinet approval.
	   His security Cabinet, however, did meet to discuss the accord's
implementation and the scheduled arrival of U.S. Middle East envoy
Dennis Ross, Israel Radio reported.
	   Israel was also waiting to receive clarification from the United
States on several points. The so-called letters of reassurance
address several matters, including the status of a later additional
troop pullout from the West Bank, Bar-Illan said.
	   Netanyahu also repeated Israeli calls for the arrest of Mohammed
Deif, a military leader of the radical Islamic group Hamas, in the
wake of a suicide bombing on Thursday in the Gaza Strip.
	   The Gaza Strip's head of security, Abdel Razak Majaydeh, said
the Palestinian Authority was working to apprehend Deif, Israel
Radio reported. Deif is believed to have been behind several deadly
attacks against Israelis and to have been hiding in Gaza for the
past three years.
	   Thursday's suicide attack was aimed at a busload of settler
schoolchildren, but a military jeep escorting the bus took the
brunt of the blast instead. An Israeli soldier died.
	   Israel's military chief-of-staff and the head of the Shin Bet
security service internal met with top Palestinian security
officials Saturday in an effort to coordinate efforts, Israel Radio
reported.
	   Also Sunday, in traditionally Arab east Jerusalem, Israeli peace
activists chained themselves to a tractor where Jewish settlers
were clearing land and preparing to build a fence. Four of the
peace activists were arrested.
	   The site in the Ras al Amud neighborhood of about 11,000
Palestinians was the scene of violent protests last fall when a
small group of Jewish settlers moved into a home owned by Miami
millionaire Irving Moskowitz, a benefactor of Jewish settler
causes.
	   To date, the Israeli government has held up work at the site,
citing public safety concerns. However, Israel radio reported that
over the weekend the government gave the go-ahead for the fence to
be built.
	   Palestinians object to any construction on the site, which they
consider an illegal settlement.
	   Left-wing Israeli lawmaker Nomi Chazan was among the small group
of peace activists protesting the activity. Chazan called the
settler action ``incitement and provocation,'' especially coming on
the anniversary of Rabin's death.
	   Also present was the top Palestinian representative in
Jerusalem, Faisel Husseini.

Christopher Gable, ballet star and actor, dies at 58
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Christopher Gable, a leading ballet star who also
had a successful acting career on stage and in film, has died of
cancer at age 58.
	   Gable died Oct. 23 at his home in Yorkshire, where he was
artistic director of the Leeds-based Northern Ballet Theatre.
	   The London-born dancer had a famous Royal Ballet partnership
with Lynn Seymour, and his first big success was with her in ``The
Invitation'' a new ballet by choreographer Kenneth MacMillan in
1960.
	   Gable's boyish good looks, grace and fine, athletic style won
him early critical success and he became one of the Royal Ballet's
most popular dancers. His second partnership with Seymour, in
Frederick Ashton's new ballet ``The Two Pigeons,'' in 1961, won the
critics' praise when he was only 20.
	   MacMillan choreographed his celebrated ``Romeo and Juliet'' for
Gable and Seymour in 1965, but they lost out on the premiere when
the ballet management decided to put the more famous Rudolf Nureyev
and Margot Fonteyn in the roles.
	   Even dancing in the second cast, Gable and Seymour were a hit
with the critics.
	   Gable left the Royal Ballet in 1966 and was guest dancer with
the Ballet Rambert, but a recurrence of osteo-arthritis in his feet
led him to concentrate on an acting career.
	   He did a season with the Royal Shakespeare Company, where he
played Lysander in Peter Book's production of ``A Midsummer Night's
Dream,'' among other roles.
	   Gable performed in the theaters of London's West End and in
Manchester, northern England, for several years. He appeared in Ken
Russell's movies ``The Boy Friend,'' in which he co-starred with
Twiggy, in 1971; ``Women in Love, ``The Music Lovers,'' and ``The
Rainbow.'
	   In 1982 he founded the respected Central School of Ballet in
London, and his wife, dancer Carole Needham, was one of the
teachers. He remained the school's artistic director.
	   Gable made an acclaimed return to the ballet stage in 1987 in
the lead role in ``A Simple Man,'' about painter L.S. Lowry. The
ballet appeared first on television and then went into the
repertory of the Northern Ballet Theatre. Soon after, he became
that company's artistic director.
	   The Northern Ballet Theatre developed a great popular success
and won awards in 1990 and 1991 for its productions of ``Giselle''
and ``Romeo and Juliet.
	   Queen Elizabeth II made Gable a CBE, or Commander of the Order
of British Empire in 1996.
	   He is survived by his wife and a son and daughter.

 &UR; Finns wake up to happy news of Hakkinen's triumph
 &UR; Eds: CLARIFIES in graf 10 that Korhonen watched every race this
season
 &UR; With Sports-Auto Racing-Japanese Grand Prix

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Auto racing fans crowded restaurants
and pubs in the early hours Sunday and got to hear and see what
they had dreamed of _ Mika Hakkinen as the new world champion in
Formula One auto racing.
	   ``People had tears in their eyes, and the roof nearly blew
off,'' said Tarja Timonen, a restaurant waitress. ``I myself had
goose pimples.''
	   It's no wonder, because Timonen works at Allun Grilli, owned by
Hakkinen's first private sponsor Aarno Kotilainen, and frequented
by the new champion's father, Harri.
	   More than 200 people crammed into the 144-seat restaurant on the
outskirts of Helsinki, near Hakkinen's childhood home. The walls
are covered with an array of Hakkinen memorabilia: his overalls,
helmets, trophies, and dozens of photographs.
	   ``The bubbly was all ready and chilled. Mika's parents Aila and
Harri had said they would treat everybody (in the restaurant) to
champagne, although they weren't here themselves,'' Timonen said.
	   Allun Grilli was one of several restaurants and pubs which
applied for a special license to open at 5 a.m. and serve mild
alcoholic drinks.
	   Despite the early morning hour, TV viewers got up to watch live
coverage of the Grand Prix from Japan which began at 5:35 a.m.
(0335GMT).
	   The previous race, which was also important for the final result
of the championship, attracted more than 1.3 million viewers in a
country of 5 million people. It even topped the main evening
newscast, which normally draws more than a million viewers.
	   Some were up hours before the race began.
	   ``I was too excited to sleep, and so nervous,'' said Osmo
Korhonen, who has watched every Grand Prix race this season live
with his wife on Finnish TV, irrespective of the hour.
	   ``It's a great day for Finland. Hakkinen did a fine job. It's so
fantastic,'' said Korhonen, 43, a postal worker.
	   Finland's previous Formula One champion from 1982 and Hakkinen's
mentor, Keke Rosberg, commented on the race for Finland's main
commercial TV channel, MTV3. The broadcast ended with a leading
men's choir singing the words to a nationalistic march played after
major sporting triumphs and during official events.
	   In downtown Helsinki, fans gathered at Planet Hollywood
chanting, ``Mika is the new world champion'' in Finnish to the tune
of the Beatles' song ``Yellow Submarine.''
	   At Allun Grilli, whole families gathered to watch the race.
	   ``With Mika winning, it was a mighty experience for the kids,''
Timonen said over the roar of singing and chanting in honor of the
neighborhood boy who made it to the top.

Twenty-Two candidates run again for Bucharest mayor
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With AP Photos

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ One woman and 21 men ran again Sunday
for mayor of Romania's capital Bucharest but low turnout may force
yet another runoff next week, an election official said.
	   Only 34.4 percent of Bucharest's 1.7 million eligible voters
cast ballots a week ago, far short of the 50 percent needed for the
results to be valid.
	   But Dan Movila of Bucharest's election bureau said ``the
situation is worse than last Sunday.''
	   To win, a candidate needs more than 50 percent of the vote.
Failing that, a runoff between the top two candidates will be held
next week.
	   Polls opened at 6 a.m. (0400 GMT) and close at 9 p.m. (1900
GMT).
	   The private and state television stations urged people to vote,
offering prizes to those who could prove they cast ballots.
	   ``I doubt the voters' presence will be more consistent today.
The enthusiasm manifested at the election in 1996 decreased
substantially due to the people's financial hardships,''
sociologist Alin Teodorescu said by telephone.
	   Teodorescu, who runs a respected poll institution, predicted
also that many of those who voted last week will not bother to do
so again.
	   The elections held last week cost the cashed-strapped city
budget lei 14 billion (almost dlrs 1.5 million). Many Bucharest
residents see this as a waste of money in a city plagued by housing
problems, pollution and poor infrastructure.
	   The ballot became necessary when Bucharest's last elected mayor
Victor Ciorbea became prime minister in 1996. He resigned from that
job in April, quitting the post of mayor at the same time.
	   Despite the absence of reliable opinion polls, incumbent mayor
Viorel Lis, who was Ciorbea's deputy, is thought to have the best
chance of winning.
	   His main competitors are Sorin Oprescu, head of Bucharest's
Municipal Hospital, and Alexandru Sassu, minister for relations
with parliament.

Hamas makes first direct threat against Arafat government
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; URGENT &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Hamas' military wing on Sunday made its first
direct threat against the government of Yasser Arafat, accusing the
Palestinian leader of treason.
	   ``The (Palestinian) Authority's security apparatus, its
officials and elements, will never be safe'' from Hamas' vengeance,
said a leaflet signed by the Izzedine al Qassem brigades, the
radical Islamic group's military arm and faxed to news
organizations.
	   Only last week the group's spiritual leader, Sheik Ahmed Yassin,
said Hamas does not want a bloody confrontation with the
Palestinian Authority.
	   But that was before Arafat put Yassin under house arrest
following a Hamas claim of responsibility for a failed suicide
bombing on Thursday aimed at Jewish settler children in the Gaza
Strip.

	   The Gaza Strip's head of security, Abdel Razak Majaydeh, said
the Palestinian Authority was working to apprehend Deif, Israel
Radio reported.
	   ``Anyone who allows himself to plan or conspire against the hero
Deif or any of our holy warriors will pay a dear price,'' the
leaflet said. ``There is no room for self-control or silence any
more.''
	   Earlier Sunday, before the leaflet appeared, chief Palestinian
negotiator Saeb Erekat said he hoped there would not be an open
clash with Hamas.
	   ``I hope not,'' he said. ``I hope all of the 26 Palestinian
parties understand that everyone is allowed to work within the rule
of law. If they oppose (the agreement), that's their business, but
they can't do it violently and cross the red line.''
	   Not everyone in Arafat's government has supported the crackdown.
Communications minister Imad Falouji, a former member of Hamas,
told reporters Saturday he opposed the crackdown and would visit
Yassin at home.

Officials annul election won by dissident
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A human rights group attacked China's system of
village elections as a sham Sunday after authorities annulled a
ballot won by a dissident, forcing a second round of voting that he
lost.
	   Yu Tielong, who was detained in July for trying to join an
illegal opposition party, was one of five candidates seeking
election as head of a village in southeastern China, the Hong
Kong-based Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic
Movement in China said.
	   Ahead of the election, a preliminary round of balloting was held
Wednesday to pare the list of five candidates down to one. Yu won
that ballot, held by a committee of 13 village representatives,
winning five votes, the Information Center said.
	   The result should have entitled Yu to stand as the formal
candidate in the one-candidate election scheduled for Monday, in
which all villagers of Wangshanding vote, the Information Center
said.
	   But after Yu won, an election official declared the preliminary
ballot void, the group said. A second ballot was ordered, this time
with just nine committee members present, it said. Yu lost, getting
3 votes, it said.
	   The incident ``reflects the sham nature of village `democratic'
elections,'' the group said.
	   Village elections have been held since 1987 throughout China.
Villagers cast secret ballots to pick leaders who decide how to
spend village revenue and help implement government policies. The
elections have been widely welcomed by foreign governments as a
sign of political progress in China.
	   The Information Center's explanation of voting procedures in
Wangshanding appeared to contradict a statement from Doji Cering,
China's minister of civil affairs, who said in June that all
villages now have more than one candidate in their elections.
	   The Information Center said Wangshanding's ballot was held
according to Zhejiang province election rules. There are often
variations in election procedures from one area of China to
another.
	   Before Wednesday's ballot, election officials had said the
eventual elected village head of Wangshanding would also have to be
approved by the Communist Party, the Information Center said.
	   Yu was detained for 10 hours on July 9 by police in Hangzhou,
his hometown and the capital of Zhejiang, after trying to join the
illegal China Democracy Party, which dissidents have sought to
register officially to challenge Communist Party rule.
	   Yu also has campaigned publicly against corruption. He announced
plans in August to circulate a petition demanding a new, public
trial for former Mayor Chen Xitong of Beijing. Chen was sentenced
this year to 16 years in prison for corruption, but critics
complained that the trial was held in secret.

Hamas makes first direct threat against Arafat government

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Hamas' military wing on Sunday made its first
direct threat against the government of Yasser Arafat, accusing the
Palestinian leader of treason.
	   The move comes three days after the radical group's spiritual
leader, Sheik Ahmed Yassin, was placed under house arrest by
Arafat's security forces, and as the Palestinians were said to be
hunting a top Hamas military leader.
	   ``The (Palestinian) Authority's security apparatus, its
officials and elements, will never be safe'' from Hamas' vengeance,
said a leaflet signed by the Izzedine al Qassem brigades, the
group's military arm, and faxed to news organizations.
	   Only last week Yassin said Hamas does not want a bloody
confrontation with the Palestinian Authority.
	   But that was before Arafat put Yassin under house arrest
following a Hamas claim of responsibility for a failed suicide
bombing on Thursday aimed at Jewish settler children in the Gaza
Strip.
	   None of the children was hurt, but an Israeli soldier was killed
when the military jeep he was riding in intercepted the
explosives-rigged car.
	   In the leaflet, Hamas claimed the jeep, not the school bus, was
its real target. ``We would never target children or the elderly,''
it said.
	   Up until now, Hamas has insisted that its quarrel is only with
Israel, with which it rejects any peace. However, it has reacted
with increasing stridency to provisions in the Oct. 23 peace accord
signed in Washington that call for a concerted move against Islamic
militants by Arafat's government.
	   ``There is no doubt that Arafat and his repressive security
apparatus have reached the point of treason and utter loyalty to
Israel,'' the leaflet said.
	   Arafat launched the wide-ranging crackdown against Hamas even
before Thursday's attack. In recent days, more than 100 Hamas
activists have been rounded up.
	   Israel has demanded the dismantling of Hamas' military wing and
also the arrest of Mohammed Deif, one of its leaders. Deif, who is
blamed for several terror attacks, has been in hiding in Gaza for
three years.
	   The Gaza Strip's head of security, Abdel Razak Majaydeh, said
the Palestinian Authority was working to apprehend Deif, Israel
Radio reported.
	   ``Anyone who allows himself to plan or conspire against the hero
Deif or any of our holy warriors will pay a dear price,'' the
leaflet said. ``There is no room for self-control or silence any
more.''
	   Earlier Sunday, before the leaflet appeared, chief Palestinian
negotiator Saeb Erekat said he hoped there would not be an open
clash with Hamas.
	   ``I hope not,'' he said. ``I hope all of the 26 Palestinian
parties understand that everyone is allowed to work within the rule
of law. If they oppose (the agreement), that's their business, but
they can't do it violently and cross the red line.''
	   Not everyone in Arafat's government has supported the crackdown.
Communications minister Imad Falouji, a former member of Hamas,
told reporters Saturday he opposed the crackdown and would visit
Yassin at home.

Official says political prisoners to be released
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ A senior Sudanese official was quoted on
Sunday as saying arrangements are underway to release all political
prisoners in two months time.
	   The announcement by the head of the ruling National Congress
party for Khartoum state, Mutasim Abdel-Rahim, appears linked to
the government's approval three weeks ago of a bill that allows the
formation of political parties.
	   ``The National Congress will be reviewing with the concerned
bodies arrangements for releasing detainees or those already
sentenced and imprisoned for political reasons,'' Abdel-Rahim told
the Akhbar al-Yawm newspaper.
	   He did not say how many detainees or political prisoners would
be freed.
	   Sudan's new constitution, which was approved in June, does not
clearly mention the right to form political parties, which were
banned after a 1989 coup, but speaks about the right to organize
political associations.
	   The new law would be effective Jan. 1 and says the associations
would be able to compete in elections.
	   President Omar el-Bashir said last week that the ``coming period
.. necessitates the creation of a healthy climate so that parties
can fully play their roles.''
	   The government has invited exiled opposition leaders back to the
country to set up political groups.
	   Sudanese opposition leaders have rejected the Islamic regime's
new constitution and vowed to keep up their struggle for a united,
secular Sudan. mo-my-ggl

Hong Kong government official dies during charity run
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A government official died Sunday while
participating in the annual Terry Fox Run to raise funds for cancer
research.
	   A government spokesman said Patrick Chim, 32, a principal
assistant secretary at the Treasury Department, collapsed during
the charity event at the Hong Kong International School.
	   The cause of death was not immediately known.
	   The Terry Fox run is named after a Canadian who ran across
Canada in 1980, despite suffering from bone cancer, to raise funds
for cancer research. Fox died in 1981.

Montenegro's president takes top party post, blasts Milosevic
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PODGORICA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Montenegro's reformist president
Milo Djukanovic strengthened his power position in the tiny
republic early Sunday by becoming head of the ruling Democratic
Party of Socialists.
	   At the party congress in Montenegrin capital Podgorica,
Djukanovic - the party's de facto leader since he split last year
with those loyal to federal President Slobodan Milosevic - was
elected the new party president by an overwhelming majority among
361 delegates.
	   The party controls Montenegro's parliament and government and
has spearheaded the tiny republic's resistance to attempted
domination by much bigger Serbia. Montenegro and Serbia form the
present-day Yugoslav federation.
	   Djukanovic is a staunch opponent of Milosevic who has allowed
only those Montenegrins loyal to him to represent the smaller
republic in the joint, federal bodies. This has deeply strained
relations between the two republics.
	   Djukanovic warned at the party convention that because of
``tyranny of the autocratic regime,'' in Belgrade, Montenegro would
continue taking over authority from the federal level and handle
its affairs more independently.
	   The congress also adopted three program documents, on further
privatization in Montenegro, general development and on future
relations within the federation.
	   Without being on principle against partnership with Serbia,
Djukanovic said that ``all possibilities have not been exhausted
for a democratic transformation of the federal state,'' but that
Montenegro needs to become and equal partner.
	   Djukanovic has also blamed Milosevic for aggravating the
situation in Serbia's southern Kosovo province. ``On all important
issues, like, for example Kosovo crisis, decisions are made far
from public view, in mysterious court games at the federal top.''

Foreign Ministry condemns Iraq for banning U.N. weapon inspectors
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia rebuked Iraq on Sunday for its decision to
cut off all work with U.N. weapons inspectors, warning Baghdad to
``weigh carefully all the negative consequences'' of the move.
	   Iraq's move ``can result in the end of further efforts aimed at
the settlement of the Iraq problem,'' the Foreign Ministry said in
a statement.
	   Iraq banned arms inspectors from working in the country
Saturday, drawing the condemnation of the U.N. Security Council,
which said the move violates U.N. resolutions and an understanding
between Iraq and U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan that averted
military confrontation in February.
	   U.N. weapons experts must certify that Iraq has destroyed its
biological, chemical and nuclear weapons before the council will
lift sanctions imposed after Baghdad invaded Kuwait in 1990.
	   ``The agreements opened the way to lifting sanctions from
Iraq,'' the Foreign Ministry said, adding that it ``hopes that in
Baghdad they will weigh all the negative consequences of this step
carefully.''
	   ``Only the resumption in full volume of the constructive
cooperation with the U.N., including the special commission, will
provide for the settlement of the situation around Iraq and the
return of its people to normal life.''
	   Russia, along with China and France, has generally been more
sympathetic to Iraq, and has urged in the past that the U.N. take
quicker steps to lift the sanctions imposed on the country.

Indonesian president urges unity ahead of government assembly
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ President B.J. Habibie appealed Sunday
for unity ahead of a special government assembly next week that is
expected to become the target of student demonstrators.
	   Speaking to more than 400 Muslim preachers at the state palace,
Habibie also said Indonesia's economic crisis was a big threat to
his efforts to promote democracy in the archipelago nation of 200
million people.
	   ``Economic difficulties, which should encourage a spirit of
social solidarity among the people, might instead engender
conflicts between political interests,'' said Habibie, who took
office in May after riots and protests helped oust his
authoritarian predecessor, former President Suharto.
	   ``I invite people of all walks of life to uphold the spirit of
unity and national brotherhood, to safeguard order and peacefulness
in order to make the reform agenda successful,'' he said.
	   Student activists who demonstrated against Suharto are planning
protests during a Nov. 10-13 government assembly that will cast the
rules for general elections scheduled for next year.
	   They say the 1,000-member People's Consultative Assembly, made
of up legislators and presidential appointees, is packed with
holdovers from the Suharto era. Many students are also clamoring
for the resignation of Habibie, a former protege of Suharto who has
distanced himself from the 77-year-old ex-president.
	   Some 30,000 police, soldiers and other officials will be on hand
to safeguard the assembly.
	   While Habibie has freed political prisoners and allowed
political parties to form, his critics say he is not moving fast
enough on democratic reforms.
	   Millions of people have been left jobless by the financial
crisis and the prices of many basic commodities, including rice,
cooking oil and gasoline, have soared.

	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ South Africa held the West Indies to
245 in 49.3 overs Sunday in the finals of the nine-nation Wills
International Cup cricket tournament.
	   South Africa began batting needing only five runs per over to
win.
	   The Windies, who batted first, were led by the powerful Phillo
Wallace with 103. Wallace's score included five sixes and 11 fours.
	   South Africa's Jacques Kallis kick-started the Windies'
collapse. His haul of five for 30 included the dismissal of Carl
Hooper, who scored 49. South African skipper Hansie Cronje was
three for 44.
	   The West Indies had easily beat India by six wickets Saturday to
set up the final with South Africa.

<TEXT>
	   LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) _ Spain came from behind twice to tie
Pakistan 2-2 in the 20th Champions Trophy men's field hockey
tournament Sunday.
	   Pakistan failed to convert a last minute penalty corner to win
the match.
	   After playing a scoreless first half, Sohail Abbas gave Pakistan
its first goal in a 55th minute penalty stroke. Victor Pujol
brought down Pakistan's forward Atif Bashir inside the striking
circle, which earned the home team a penalty stroke.
	   However, Pakistan's lead was short lived as Josep Sanchez netted
the equaliser three minutes later.
	   Pakistan, who was beaten 2-3 in its opening match against South
Korea Saturday, initiated some fine moves in the second half of
play against Spain.
	   Left-winger Babar Abdullah latched onto a rebound after captain
Mohammad Usman's strike from the top of the circle was stopped by
goalkeeper Ramon Jufresa.
	   With only a minute of play remaining, Spain earned its seventh
penalty corner and Juan Escarre struck from an indirect drill.
	   ``We should have held onto our 2-1 lead,'' said Pakistan captain
Usman. ``But we allowed them to counter attack which cost us.''
	   Both Pakistan and Spain, beaten 2-3 by Holland on Saturday, now
have one point each from two games.
	   Result: Pakistan 2 (Sohail Abbas (55th min), Babar Abdullah
(63rd min); Spain 2 (Josep Sanchez (58th min), Juan Escarre (69th
min).
	   Teams: Pakistan: Muhammad Usman (captain), Ahmad Alam, Aamir
Salim, Ali Raza, Imran Yousuf, Waseem Ahmed, Haider Hussain,
Muhammad Sarwar, Kamran Ashraf, Naveed Iqbal, Anis Ahmed, Muhammad
Qasim, Sohail Abbas, Asad Ali Qureshi, Atif Bashir, Babar Abdullah.
	   Spain: Ramon Jufresa, Xavier Ribas, Francisco Fabregas, Juan
Escarre, Victor Pujol, Pablo Amat, Jordi Casas, Javier Arnau, Ramon
Sala, Josep Sanchez, Pablo Usoz (captain), Bernardino Herrera,
Miquel Herreros, Rodrigo Garza, Santiago Ferran, Eduardo, Aculiar.

U.N.: La Nina fueled by continuing drop in Pacific temperatures
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: EMBARGOED by source until 0001 GMT Monday, Nov. 2. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The surface of the Pacific Ocean is expected to
continue cooling slowly for the rest of the year, fueling the La
Nina weather phenomenon, the U.N. weather agency said Monday.
	   ``Weak La Nina conditions'' have started to develop, the World
Meteorological Organization said in its El Nino/La Nina Update. La
Nina, caused by a large pool of abnormally cool water in the
eastern Pacific, alternates with the warming El Nino.
	   By October, cooler than normal surface temperatures were in
evidence from the west coast of South America to well west of the
International dateline, WMO said.
	   The current La Nina started when surface temperatures in the
tropical Pacific dropped rapidly in May and June.
	   The shift brought heavy rainfall and flash floods to Indonesia
in August after a long drought caused by the El Nino phenomenon. It
has also brought rain to Australia.
	   An increased number of hurricanes over the Atlantic ``is
consistent with developing La Nina conditions,'' WMO said.
	   Last Sept. 24, four Atlantic hurricanes were active at the same
time, the first time this has happened this century.
	   El Nino is created when trade winds weaken, allowing a large
mass of warm water in the western Pacific to pulse to the east
along the equator toward South America.
	   During El Nino, the warm water interacts with the atmosphere
above it, creating a worldwide disruption in weather patterns. The
1997-98 El Nino, the strongest ever recorded, meant record rain in
California, heavy flooding in Peru, drought in Indonesia and
tornadoes and flooding in Florida.
	   La Nina, Spanish for ``little girl,'' is just the opposite, with
the warm conditions of El Nino returning to the west. During La
Nina, which typically lasts at least a year, dry conditions take
hold of South America, Africa has alternate periods of drought and
flooding and rains return to Asia.
	   Because of its association with monsoon rains in south Asia,
``La Nina's impacts in that region are typically viewed as less
disruptive than those of El Nino,'' the WMO report said.
	   ``However, La Nina's relatively benign image may not be entirely
appropriate,'' it cautioned.
	   WMO added that uncertainty over surface temperatures in the
Atlantic and Indian Oceans, which contribute to changing rainfall
over Africa and South America, makes an accurate forecast
difficult.
	   But it said there are increased possibilities of below-normal
rainfall in eastern Africa through next March.

Turkish inmates begin hunger strike to protest prison conditions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ERZURUM, Turkey (AP) _ Some 50 prisoners are on a hunger strike
to protest conditions in a high-security prison of the eastern city
of Erzurum, human rights activists said Sunday.
	   Prisoners, who began their hunger strike Wednesday, claim that
authorities have refused to grant medical treatment to prisoners
injured in recent prison riots, Turkey's Human Rights Association
said.
	   ``These are all lies. Prisoners are always taken to hospital if
in need of medical care,'' said Catay Kayiran, in charge of
Turkey's penitentiaries.
	   Turkey's prisons, which house some 9,000 prisoners linked to
leftist or Kurdish groups, are frequently rocked by riots and
hunger strikes.
	   Last week, inmates took over 50 prison officials hostage in
prisons throughout the country to protest conditions.

Singapore PM suggests tax, fee cuts, says banks stable
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The government will have to offer tax and fee
cuts in response to workers' acceptance of lower wages and smaller
pension contributions, Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong was quoted as
saying Sunday.
	   Goh was commenting on agreement by the National Trades Union
Congress on Saturday to accept 10 percent reductions in employers'
contributions to pension funds, reduced wages and anything else the
government finds necessary to weather the Asian economic crisis.
	   ``The government will have to complement that with cuts in taxes
and fees as well,'' government-run television quoted Goh as saying.
He did not specify which taxes and fees.
	   ``We are facing a crisis, externally induced,'' he said. ``We've
got to see how we can cushion the impact of this regional crisis on
us.''
	   He said that if the crisis is not extensive, ``it's all right.
Singapore is OK. It's not a problem.
	   ``Our banks are OK, not about to collapse,'' he said. ``Even
with this crisis, our banks are all right.''
	   He joined the unions in calling for employers to find ways to
cut costs other than wages as part of a national effort to save
jobs and attract more investments to Singapore, the television
report said.

Yeltsin has no planned meetings in next few days
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin, on vacation in southern
Russia following his latest bout of ill health, will not hold any
meetings in the next few days, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported
Sunday.
	   Yeltsin arrived Friday at the resort of Sochi for a two-week
stay to rest on the orders of his doctors. Reportedly suffering
extreme fatigue and high blood pressure, he handed over many of his
responsibilities to Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov last week.
	   Yeltsin has been plagued by health problems in recent years,
prompting speculation that he is not capable of fulfilling his
duties or serving out the remainder of his term, which expires in
2000. The opposition repeated calls last week for Yeltsin to
resign, but the president repeatedly has said he will never step
down.
	   Yeltsin did take time Sunday to congratulate the Kultura
television channel on its first anniversary of operations. He
signed a decree last year establishing the channel, which devotes
itself only to cultural programming.
	   ``The contribution of the channel Kultura in saving the rich
tradition of our fatherland's cultural legacy is difficult to
overestimate,'' Yeltsin wrote in the statement.

Apartheid's last president granted divorce after 39 years marriage
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Former President F.W. de Klerk
was granted a divorce from his wife of 39 years, Marike, in a Cape
Town court, newspapers in Johannesburg reported.
	   De Klerk, who presided over the end of apartheid and shared the
1993 Nobel Peace Prize with Nelson Mandela, announced earlier this
year that he was in love with Elita Giorgiades, the wife of Greek
shipping magnate Tony Giorgiades.
	   Mrs. Giorgiades was divorced in August and has been seen with De
Klerk on her farm near Cape Town, the Sunday Independent reported.
	   The divorce was uncontested and provides for a 10,000 rand (dlrs
1,800) monthly payment to Mrs. De Klerk until she remarries, the
Sunday Times of Johannesburg reported.
	   De Klerk, 62, has largely stepped back from politics, but last
week successfully blocked the publication of negative findings
about his role in apartheid era human rights abuses.
	   Through legal action, De Klerk forced the Truth and
Reconciliation Commission to excise references to the former
president before releasing its historic report on Thursday.

Russian businessman killed in apartment building
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A man was shot dead in his Moscow apartment
building early Sunday in what police are calling a contract
killing, a news agency reported.
	   Alexander Grigolyunosa was shot three times in the chest and
once in the head in the stairwell of his apartment building at 1:20
am, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Near Grigolyunosa's body, police found a Beretta pistol equipped
with a silencer, seven spent cartridges and one 7.65 mm bullet.
Leaving the murder weapon next to a body is a traditional sign of
contract killings in Russia.
	   Immediately after the discovery of the body, police conducted a
search in the area of the killing, but arrested no suspects,
ITAR-Tass said.
	   Local media said Grigolyunosa was the general director of a
Russian oil company, but the Associated Press could not confirm the
reports.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Hamas' military wing on Sunday made its first
direct threat against the government of Yasser Arafat, accusing the
Palestinian leader of treason.
	   ``The (Palestinian) Authority's security apparatus, its
officials and elements, will never be safe'' from Hamas' vengeance,
said a leaflet signed by the Izzedine al Qassem brigades, the
radical Islamic group's military arm and faxed to news
organizations.
	   The office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said it would
not comment on the threat until its authenticity could be verified.
However, the ornate language, style and phrasing were similar to
past communications from Hamas' military wing.
	   A senior Palestinian security official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, also declined immediate comment.

Reports: signs point to arson in fire that killed 60
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Will be updated from news conference scheduled for 1400 GMT &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GOTEBORG, Sweden (AP) _ As investigators searched for the cause
of a dance-hall fire that killed 60 people, some as young as 12,
indications were growing that fire was set, reports said Sunday.
	   ''Foremost is the fact that we haven't found any natural
explanation for the fire, which indicates that it could have been
set,'' prosecutor Ulf Noren, leading the investigation, was quoted
as saying by the newspaper Expressen.
	   The newspaper also reported that police were told just hours
after the devastating blaze that one of the 162 injured claimed to
know who allegedly set the fire.
	   Police commissioner Hans Carlsson declined to comment directly
on that report, saying only ''I don't have any perpetrator,''
Expressen said.
	   The fire broke out shortly before midnight Thursday in a
second-floor hall jammed with up to 400 youths, far beyond the
facility's legal capacity of 150. The fire blocked the emergency
exit stairway, forcing panicked dancers to try to escape down the
staircase at the main entrance or leap out of windows.
	   The dance's disc jockey has said he saw smoke in the emergency
exit stairway just below flames exploded through the hall.
	   The fact that the emergency exit was burning ''is a circumstance
that indicates the fire could have been set,'' Ralf Johansson, head
of the Goteborg police technical division, was quoted as telling
the newspaper Aftonbladet.
	   Witnesses have said the emergency exit stairway was crowded with
wooden furniture, Expressen reported.
	   While investigators continued their work, friends and relatives
of the victims wrestled with grief.
	   The horror fell especially hard on the Shaker family:
12-year-old Jasmin Shaker and her sister, 17-year-old Meriam, both
died in the fire and another sister, Shirin, 13, is hospitalized
with injuries. Meriam had escaped the blazing hall, but died when
she went back in to try to save Jasmin.
	   Like the Shaker girls, many of the victims were immigrants from
troubled countries, or children of immigrant parents, and the fire
was a dreadful irony to those who had come to Sweden seeking calm.
	   ''We left Iraq 18 years ago. We didn't want our children to grow
up with war and bombs. And then this happens,'' the girls' uncle,
Hassan Bakir, was quoted as saying in Expressen.

Poll: Nearly half of Russians would welcome humanitarian aid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Nearly half of all Russians would welcome western
humanitarian aid this winter, but most of them do not think hunger
will threaten their families, according to a poll released Sunday.
	   Of 1,608 Russians polled, 45 percent said they would welcome
humanitarian aid from the West, while 39 percent were opposed to
the idea, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   But 74 percent said they did not think their families would be
threatened by hunger, while 14 percent did. The remainder were
undecided.
	   Interfax did not give a margin of error for the poll, which was
conducted by the All-Russia Public Opinion Center.
	   The government has discussed the possibility of foreign aid
following the devaluation of the Russian currency in August, which
plunged the country in to the worst economic crisis since the end
of Communism. The government says it does not expect any threat of
starvation this winter.
	   But those more likely to need aid, were more likely to oppose
it, according to the poll.
	   People who approved of humanitarian aid tended to be
businessmen, students, people under 40, those who live in large
cities, and people with above-average incomes, Interfax said They
also tended to have voted for President Boris Yeltsin in the 1996
elections.
	   Those who opposed aid were mostly pensioners, unemployed people,
those who live in small towns, and people who voted for Communist
leader Gennady Zyuganov in 1996.

Slovakia hopes to bring 2006 Winter Olympics to its eastern
</HEADLINE>
mountains &QL; 
 &UR; By ANDREA LORINCZOVA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ This small country that calls itself
``the heart of Europe'' is hoping to bring the 2006 Winter Olympics
to its eastern mountains, which Slovakia hopes to build into a
major tourism center for its struggling economy.
	   The International Olympic Committee's evaluation team finished a
four-day tour Sunday of sites in the High Tatra mountains. Slovak
Olympic officials said the team pointed out no major faults in the
Slovak candidacy.
	   Local officials believe the High Tatras, whose highest peak
Gerlachovsky Stit stands 2,655 meters (8,711 feet) above sea level,
have a major advantage over other contenders.
	   ``Our advantages are the short distances between the Olympic
sites, and short transportation access to the mountains from Slovak
cities and surrounding countries,'' said the general secretary of
the Slovak Olympic Commission, Martin Benko.
	   Slovakia's hockey star, Peter Stastny, who recently entered the
Hall of Fame, said there would be advantages to hold the Winter
Games in a former Communist country.
	   ``There is no fear that the sports centers, which would have to
be built, would be empty after the Olympics,'' Stastny said.
``There are very few of good quality sports centers in the country,
so they would surely be used.''
	   Slovakia's bid for the 2006 Winter Games is its second attempt
in the six years since the country broke off from Czechoslovakia.
The 2002 bid stumbled over the financial and organization problems
in the program.
	   ``The approach of the management towards 2006 bid has improved.
All of us realized that this is an important bid for Central
Europe, and we started working harder,'' Benko said.
	   But officials admit that the bid for the Games is a longshot.
Slovakia's economy is going through a major restructuring. A new,
Western-oriented government, which took power last week, hopes to
end the relative isolation of the last administration, led by the
autocratic former prime minister, Vladimir Meciar.
	   ``None of us can predict what the country's economy will be like
in 2006. But our plans are firm. We have prepared two budgets. One
covers the organization of the games and that is dlrs 583 million.
The country has to invest about dlrs 1.1 billion into its
infrastructure,'' Benko said.
	   Financing for those improvements is to be covered jointly by the
central government, municipalities and the private sector.
	   More than 90 percent of the residents of the Poprad region,
where Slovakia would hold the Games, showed their support in a
referendum for the organization of the Olympic Games 2006.
	   Newly appointed Prime Minister Mikulas Dzurinda met with the
representatives of the IOC evaluation commission on Saturday, only
a day after he was appointed in the office, and expressed the
government's support for the bid.
	   ``Dzurinda came 24 hours after he is in the office and gave oral
and written support for the bid,'' said Benko.
	   The IOC team left the Slovak mountains for Poland to look at
that country's application for the 2006 Games.

Jordan stifles Hamas, bans statements to reporters

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ The government has ordered supporters of
the militant Palestinian group Hamas to stop talking to the media,
cutting off a major platform for criticizing Israel, officials of
the group said Sunday.
	   The move comes after the Palestine National Authority placed the
group's spiritual leader, Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, under house arrest
in the Gaza Strip in line with recent security agreements with
Israel.
	   In Amman, Hamas officials said the government asked them to stop
making statements to reporters shortly after the Palestinians and
Israel signed the Wye peace deal on Oct. 23. The officials spoke on
condition of anonymity.
	   The deal, signed in Washington, calls on the Palestinian
authority to crack down on militant groups including Hamas, which
advocates Israel's annihilation.
	   Several officials with the political bureau of Hamas live in
Jordan. Israel has often said orders for terror attacks on its
civilians came from them, but Hamas has denied this.
	   There was no immediate government comment on the reports. The
Jordanian government says Hamas has no bases in Jordan, but that
there are Hamas sympathizers in its predominantly Palestinian
population.
	   Hamas spokesman Ibrahim Ghosheh declined to comment on the ban.
	   When asked to comment on political issues, he said: ``I am not
allowed to comment on anything. I can speak to you as a Jordanian
citizen, but not as a Hamas official.''
	   Prime Minister Fayez Tarawneh hinted at the Hamas ban Saturday,
saying that Jordan will not allow any actions to impede the
implementation of the Wye accords.
	   After meeting Palestinian leader Yasser Afafat in the Gaza
Strip, Tarawneh repeated the Jordanian position that ``Hamas has no
leadership, no representation and no bases in Jordan.''
	   Since signing a peace treaty with Israel in 1994, Jordan often
has detained Hamas figures under pressure from the United States
and Israel.
	   But the ban on statements to the press deals a serious blow to
the group, which has not had similar privileges in other Arab
countries such as Syria and Lebanon.

Hamas makes first direct threat against Arafat government

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In a potentially serious blow to the fledgling
peace accords, Hamas' military wing on Sunday made its first direct
threat against the government of Yasser Arafat, accusing the
Palestinian leader of treason.
	   All-out conflict between Arafat's government and the radical
Islamic group could make it extremely difficult to move ahead with
the implementation of the Israeli-Palestinian land-for-security
agreement signed Oct. 23 in Washington.
	   The threat comes three days after Arafat put Hamas' spiritual
leader, Sheik Ahmed Yassin, under house arrest, and as the
Palestinians were said to be hunting a top Hamas military leader.
	   ``There is no doubt that Arafat and his repressive security
apparatus have reached the point of treason,'' said the leaflet
signed by the Hamas military arm, the Izzedine al Qassem brigades,
and faxed to news organizations. ``The beginning of infighting has
appeared, and no one can put out its fire.''
	   In the leaflet, Hamas appealed to Arafat to halt an ongoing
crackdown against ``our sons and fighters'' in order to spare
Palestinians ``the horrors...of civil war.''
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office declined to
comment on the leaflet until its authenticity could be verified to
its satisfaction. However, the ornate language, style and phrasing
were extremely similar to past communications from Hamas' military
wing.
	   A senior Palestinian security official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, also refused immediate comment.
	   Only last week, Yassin said Hamas does not want a bloody
confrontation with the Palestinian Authority. But that was before
the sheik was put under house arrest following a Hamas claim of
responsibility for a failed suicide bombing on Thursday aimed at
Jewish settler children in the Gaza Strip.
	   None of the children was hurt, but an Israeli soldier was killed
when the military jeep he was riding in intercepted the
explosives-rigged car.
	   In the leaflet, Hamas claimed the army jeep, not the school bus,
was its real target.
	   ``We would never target children or the elderly,'' it said.
	   Up until now, Hamas has insisted that its quarrel is only with
Israel, with which it vehemently rejects any peace. However, it has
denounced the peace accords' call for Arafat's government to move
concertedly against Islamic militants.
	   Arafat launched the wide-ranging crackdown against Hamas even
before Thursday's attack. In recent days, more than 100 Hamas
activists have been rounded up, including several top leaders.
Among those jailed was the group's spokesman, Mahmoud Zahar.
	   Israel has demanded the dismantling of Hamas' military wing and
also the arrest of Mohammed Deif, one of its leaders. Deif, who is
blamed for several terror attacks, has been in hiding in Gaza for
three years.
	   The Gaza Strip's head of security, Abdel Razak Majaydeh, said
the Palestinian Authority was working to apprehend Deif, Israel
radio reported.
	   ``Anyone who allows himself to plan or conspire against the hero
Deif or any of our holy warriors will pay a high price,'' the
leaflet said. ``There is no room for self-control or silence any
more.''
	   Earlier Sunday, before the leaflet appeared, chief Palestinian
negotiator Saeb Erekat expressed hopes that there would not be an
open clash with Hamas.
	   ``I hope all of the 26 Palestinian parties understand that
everyone is allowed to work within the rule of law. If they oppose
(the agreement), that's their business, but they can't do it
violently and cross the red line,'' he said.
	   Not everyone in Arafat's government has supported the crackdown.
Communications minister Imad Falouji, a former member of Hamas,
told reporters Saturday he opposed the arrests and would visit
Yassin at home.

`Jumbo' Ozaki wins Philip Morris Championship
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KATO, Japan (AP) _ Masashi ``Jumbo'' Ozaki finished off a course
record-tying 8-under-par 64 with a 30-foot (9-meter) eagle putt
Sunday as he came from eight shots behind and won the Philip Morris
Championship golf tournament.
	   It was the third victory this season for the 51-year-old Ozaki,
who now has a career total of 109 titles and is seeking top money
earning honors for the fifth consecutive season.
	   Ozaki shot his eighth birdie of the day on the 436-yard, par-4
17th hole, and then eagled the 536-yard, par-5 18th.
	   His 13-under 275 total held up when Mitsuo Harada, seeking the
second victory of his career, missed a 6 1/2-foot (2-meter) birdie
putt on the final hole for 70-276.
	   Ozaki had started the day eight strokes behind third-round
leader Shusaku Sugimoto.
	   ``I couldn't anticipate winning this tournament at all,'' said
Ozaki, who received 36 million yen (dlrs 310,000) from a purse of
200 million yen (dlrs 1.7 million).
	   Harada and Paraguay's Carlos Franco each received 15.12 million
yen (dlrs 130,000) for their 276 totals after Franco shot a 71
Sunday on the 7,176-yard, par-72 ABC Golf club course in western
Japan.
	   Sugimoto shot a 74 and tied for fourth at 277 with Frankie
Minoza of the Philippines and American Brandt Jobe. Minoza shot 66
and Jobe 70 Sunday.

	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ South Africa held the West Indies to
245 in 49.3 overs Sunday in the finals of the nine-nation Wills
International Cup cricket tournament.
	   South Africa began batting needing only five runs per over to
win.
	   The Windies, who batted first, were led by the powerful Phillo
Wallace with 103. Wallace's score included five sixes and 11 fours.
	   South Africa's Jacques Kallis kick-started the Windies'
collapse. His haul of five for 30 included the dismissal of Carl
Hooper, who scored 49. South African skipper Hansie Cronje was
three for 44.
	   The Windies' biggest blow came when captain Brian Lara was
bowled around his legs by off-spinner Derek Crookes. Lara left with
an 11 that included a brilliant six.
	   The West Indies had easily beat India by six wickets Saturday to
set up the final with South Africa. South Africa beat Sri Lanka in
its semi-final on Friday.

German leaders keep after Bundesbank to cut rates
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Germany's new center-left government ratcheted up
the pressure on the central bank to cut interest rates, arguing
Sunday that job creation is just as important as fighting inflation
when setting monetary policy.
	   Although not directly joining Finance Minister Oskar
Lafontaine's call for lower interest rates, Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder sharply criticized the central bank for focusing too much
on maintaining a strong currency.
	   ``With all respect to the independence of the Bundesbank, it
should now not only pay attention to price stability, but also try
to do justice to its responsibility for economic growth in
Germany,'' he said in a speech Saturday before a union congress in
Duisburg.
	   ``My request is that all instruments be used to allow the
economy to grow,'' he said, adding ``We want to create a consensus
and not lead a fight'' with the bank.
	   Lafontaine said he planned to deliver the message in person to
the Bundesbank's governing council during its regular meeting
Thursday.
	   ``We say monetary policy also has a role to play with growth and
employment,'' Lafontaine said in an interview aired Sunday on
German television. ``Whoever denies that can do so, but is
economically on the wrong side.''
	   The fiercely independent Bundesbank has so far ignored the new
government's repeated calls for interest rate cuts to spur the
economy and help reduce German unemployment, stuck above 10
percent.
	   The bank argues German rates are already at record lows and
economic growth is not showing signs of seriously weakening despite
financial crises around the globe.
	   Bundesbank vice president Juergen Stark said he was surprised
that the new government was trying to tell the bank how to do its
job.
	   ``Many of those who are returning to Bonn after 10 years maybe
missed the fact that the independence of the Bundesbank and the
priority of price stability has in the meantime taken on a
constitutional character,'' he told a Munich newspaper, the
Sueddeutsche Zeitung.
	   Schroeder stressed both he and Lafontaine respect the
Bundesbank's independence.
	   Yet Der Spiegel newsmagazine reported in this week's issue that
Lafontaine has already chosen a more like-minded candidate to
replace Bundesbank chief Hans Tietmeyer next year.
	   The magazine said Lafontaine wanted Ernst Welteke, the head of
the central bank in Hesse state and a fellow Social Democrat, in
the post.
	   Welteke, 56, is considered less of an anti-inflation hardliner
when it comes to setting interest rates than Tietmeyer, who will
retire next year when he turns 68.
	   The Finance Ministry labeled the report ``pure speculation'' and
said the decision had not yet been made.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ A defiant Iraq said Sunday it would not
back down from its decision to ban U.N. weapons inspectors from
working in the country, even if military action were threatened.
Vice President Taha Hussein Ramadan said in a speech opening a
trade fair here that ``there will be no cooperation (with the
inspectors) before Iraq's demands are met'' and that the country
would maintain this stance ``until the sanctions are lifted.'' His
comments came the morning after the U.N. Security Council issued a
statement condemning Iraq's decision Saturday to cut off all
dealings with arms inspectors as ``a flagrant violation'' of U.N.
resolutions. The council also repeated its offer to review Iraq's
compliance with U.N. resolutions if it resumes cooperation with
U.N. weapons inspectors. ``Iraq rejects the latest U.N. Security
Council statement and will not back down,'' Ramadan said. ``Iraq
does not fear the threat of the United States because it has been
threatening Iraq for the past eight years.'' (IRAQ-UN)
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ A new Protestant gang opposed
to Northern Ireland's prevailing cease-fires claimed responsibility
Sunday for the killing of a Catholic civilian. A caller
representing the Red Hand Defenders told the BBC's office in
Londonderry that the group fatally shot 35-year-old Brian Service
as he walked home alone early Saturday on Belfast's rough north
side. The caller also claimed responsibility for another gun attack
on a pub in Catholic west Belfast in which nobody was hurt. The
killing demonstrates a new dissident threat within the ranks of
Northern Ireland's many outlawed pro-British groups: the Ulster
Defense Association, Ulster Volunteer Force and Red Hand Commando,
which have observed a joint cease-fire since 1994, and the Loyalist
Volunteer Force, which joined the truce after politicians struck a
historic peace accord six months ago. Such groups have killed more
than 900 people, mostly Catholic civilians at random, in a
three-decade campaign aimed at matching violence committed by the
Irish Republican Army. (NORTHERN IRELAND)
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ As Israel marked the third anniversary of the
assassination of the prime minister who launched the Mideast peace
process, its Cabinet on Sunday put off discussion of the latest
peace deal. At the Cabinet meeting, ministers held a moment of
silence to remember Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who was slain
three years ago by an ultra-nationalist Jew who opposed ceding land
to the Palestinians. Flags flew at half-mast and ceremonies were
held across the country in a national day of remembrance for Rabin,
who was gunned down Nov. 4, 1995. On Saturday night, about 300,000
people gathered in a Tel Aviv square now named after Rabin to pay
tribute to him. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he would not
bring the Wye River agreement, signed Oct. 23 in Washington, to his
Cabinet until after Palestinians had submitted a security document
on fighting terrorism. (ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS)
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Hamas' military wing on Sunday made its first
direct threat against the government of Yasser Arafat, accusing the
Palestinian leader of treason. ``The (Palestinian) Authority's
security apparatus, its officials and elements, will never be
safe'' from Hamas' vengeance, said a leaflet signed by the Izzedine
al Qassem brigades, the radical Islamic group's military arm and
faxed to news organizations. Palestinian security and Israeli
officials did not immediately comment. Only last week the group's
spiritual leader, Sheik Ahmed Yassin, said Hamas does not want a
bloody confrontation with the Palestinian Authority. But that was
before Arafat put Yassin under house arrest following a Hamas claim
of responsibility for a failed suicide bombing on Thursday aimed at
Jewish settler children in the Gaza Strip. None of the children
were hurt, but an Israeli soldier was killed when the jeep he was
riding in intercepted the explosives-rigged car.
(PALESTINIAN-HAMAS)
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Calling the slaughter of Afghan
civilians in northern Afghanistan by invading Taliban soldiers
``one of the worst atrocities of Afghanistan's long civil war,''
Human Rights Watch called Sunday for a speedy investigation by the
United Nations. In interviews with survivors, officials of the
U.S.-based Human Rights Watch heard horrific stories of marauding
Taliban soldiers shooting at ``anything that moves.'' Survivors
said soldiers went house to house dragging out ethnic Hazaras, who
are Shiite Muslims, and shooting them, rounding up hundreds,
perhaps thousands of young men, and packing them into rail cars for
transportation to jail. ``In a very brutal war, this is a
particularly brutal episode,'' said Patricia Gossman, senior
researcher of Human Rights Watch's Asia Division. ``We are talking
about the systematic execution of perhaps 2,000 civilians, in large
part because of their ethnic and religious identity.'' The Taliban
religious army, which rules roughly 90 percent of Afghanistan, took
control of the northern opposition stronghold of Mazar-e-Sharif in
August. (AFGHANISTAN-MASSACRE)

Deputy Prime Minister Nasser al-Rowdhan resigns
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Deputy Prime Minister Nasser al-Rowdhan, who also
served as minister of state for Cabinet affairs, resigned Sunday.
	   Al-Rowdhan's resignation has been accepted and his services at
``critical times in Kuwait's history'' were much appreciated, a
Cabinet statement said.
	   Al-Rowdhan was best known for his tenure as finance minister
from shortly after the country's 1991 liberation from Iraqi
occupation until earlier this year.
	   The Cabinet did not say why al-Rowdhan quit, but the independent
daily Al-Qabas quoted him as saying the reasons were health-related
and he ``wanted to rest.''
	   Al-Rowdhan denied reports he was resigning to avoid an upcoming
grilling by Parliament, Al-Qabas said.
	   The minister survived a 12-hour questioning before the 50-seat
legislature in July 1997, when lawmakers accused him of wasting
public money. He was appointed minister of state in a March
reshuffle.

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Greece's Nikos Pollias set a national
record Sunday in winning the Athens Marathon in 2 hours, 18
minutes, 38 seconds over the ancient route that gives the event its
name.
	   Pollias led for most of the way from Marathon to central Athens.
Countrymen Vassilis Zambelis was second at 2:22:57 and Gerasimos

	   The race concluded at the all-marble Pan Athenian stadium, site
of the first modern Olympic Games in 1896. The same route is
planned for the 2004 Olympics.
	   The course is said to closely follow the route taken by an
Athenian soldier in 490 B.C. from the plain of Marathon to the
Acropolis in Athens, where he collapsed and died after announcing
the victory of the Greeks against Persian invaders.
	   The annual Athens Marathon is dedicated to Grigoris Lambrakis,
the Greek pacifist murdered in 1963. Participation of non-Greek
athletes was low since this year's race coincided with the New York
Marathon.

German leaders keep after Bundesbank to cut rates
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with opposition criticism in grafs 11-12 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Germany's new center-left government ratcheted up
the pressure on the central bank to cut interest rates, arguing
Sunday that job creation is just as important as fighting inflation
when setting monetary policy.
	   Although not directly joining Finance Minister Oskar
Lafontaine's call for lower interest rates, Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder sharply criticized the central bank for focusing too much
on maintaining a strong currency.
	   ``With all respect to the independence of the Bundesbank, it
should now not only pay attention to price stability, but also try
to do justice to its responsibility for economic growth in
Germany,'' he said in a speech Saturday before a union congress in
Duisburg.
	   ``My request is that all instruments be used to allow the
economy to grow,'' he said, adding ``We want to create a consensus
and not lead a fight'' with the bank.
	   Lafontaine said he planned to deliver the message in person to
the Bundesbank's governing council during its regular meeting
Thursday.
	   ``We say monetary policy also has a role to play with growth and
employment,'' Lafontaine said in an interview aired Sunday on
German television. ``Whoever denies that can do so, but is
economically on the wrong side.''
	   The fiercely independent Bundesbank has so far ignored the new
government's repeated calls for interest rate cuts to spur the
economy and help reduce German unemployment, stuck above 10
percent.
	   The bank argues German rates are already at record lows and
economic growth is not showing signs of seriously weakening despite
financial crises around the globe.
	   Bundesbank vice president Juergen Stark said he was surprised
that the new government was trying to tell the bank how to do its
job.
	   ``Many of those who are returning to Bonn after 10 years maybe
missed the fact that the independence of the Bundesbank and the
priority of price stability has in the meantime taken on a
constitutional character,'' he told a Munich newspaper, the
Sueddeutsche Zeitung.
	   The opposition Christian Democrats called ``the attempt to
create jobs through inflation'' wrongheaded and ``antisocial''
because people with low incomes would be hurt the most by higher
prices.
	   ``Germany must remain the stability anchor in Europe,'' said
Peter Hintze, general secretary for the Christian Democrats.
	   Schroeder stressed both he and Lafontaine respect the
Bundesbank's independence.
	   Yet Der Spiegel newsmagazine reported in this week's issue that
Lafontaine has already chosen a more like-minded candidate to
replace Bundesbank chief Hans Tietmeyer next year.
	   The magazine said Lafontaine wanted Ernst Welteke, the head of
the central bank in Hesse state and a fellow Social Democrat, in
the post.
	   Welteke, 56, is considered less of an anti-inflation hardliner
when it comes to setting interest rates than Tietmeyer, who will
retire next year when he turns 68.
	   The Finance Ministry labeled the report ``pure speculation'' and
said the decision had not yet been made.

US official visits refugees in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- U.S. Assistant Secretary of State
Julia Taft visited two villages in western Kosovo on Sunday during
a one-day trip to the province to assess humanitarian efforts and
needs.
	   Taft talked to an ethnic Albanian family at their compound in
the foothills south of Pec, 100 kilometers (60 miles) west of
Pristina, about security now that they have moved back to their
home.
	   Family members complained that Serb police harass them, arrest
people and make them feel unsafe, despite the Oct. 12 agreement
between Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and U.S. envoy
Richard Holbrooke to bring peace to the province.
	   They said only international troops, not the unarmed foreign
verification force being created, could solve their problem.
	   ``The Westerners are not going to solve the problem,'' said
Taft, whose portfolio covers population, refugee and migration
issues. ``The people who live here must come to an agreement to
solve their problem.''
	   The head of the family, who asked that his name not be used
because he feared retribution by Serb police, told her: ``I don't
think that it will be possible.''
	   Roy Williams, a chief emergency relief official for the U.S.
Agency for International Development, said some progress was being
made in helping thousands of refugees who have started returning to
their homes. But he acknowledged that security problems hinder
progress in some places.
	   ``It's a mixed picture, that's for sure,'' said Williams, who
arrived in Kosovo last week and accompanied Taft on Sunday.
	   The focus of the refugee relief effort was shifting a little to
include helping people returning to damaged houses get construction
supplies to make repairs, Williams said. While some supplies were
available in Yugoslavia, other materials such as plywood sheets for
temporary shelter must be brought in, he added.
	   Taft arrived Saturday night and was scheduled to travel to
Belgrade on Sunday evening after holding a news conference in
Pristina.

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ This small country that calls itself
``the heart of Europe'' is hoping to bring the 2006 Winter Olympics
to its eastern mountains, which Slovakia hopes to build into a
major tourism center for its struggling economy.
	   The International Olympic Committee's evaluation team finished a
four-day tour Sunday of sites in the High Tatra mountains. Slovak
Olympic officials said the team pointed out no major faults in the
Slovak candidacy.
	   Local officials believe the High Tatras, whose highest peak
Gerlachovsky Stit stands 2,655 meters (8,711 feet) above sea level,
have a major advantage over other contenders.
	   ``Our advantages are the short distances between the Olympic
sites, and short transportation access to the mountains from Slovak
cities and surrounding countries,'' said the general secretary of
the Slovak Olympic Commission, Martin Benko.
	   Slovakia's hockey star, Peter Stastny, who recently entered the
Hall of Fame, said there would be advantages to hold the Winter
Games in a former Communist country.
	   ``There is no fear that the sports centers, which would have to
be built, would be empty after the Olympics,'' Stastny said.
``There are very few of good quality sports centers in the country,
so they would surely be used.''
	   Slovakia's bid for the 2006 Winter Games is its second attempt
in the six years since the country broke off from Czechoslovakia.
The 2002 bid stumbled over the financial and organization problems
in the program.
	   ``The approach of the management towards 2006 bid has improved.
All of us realized that this is an important bid for Central
Europe, and we started working harder,'' Benko said.
	   Other contenders include Sion, Switzerland; Turin, Italy;
Zakopane, Poland; Helsinki, Finland; and Klagenfurt, Austria. The
2006 host city will be selected by the IOC on June 19, 1999, at its
session in Seoul, South Korea. Sion is considered the early
favorite.
	   Officials admit that Slovakia's bid for the Games is a longshot.
Slovakia's economy is going through a major restructuring. A new,
Western-oriented government, which took power last week, hopes to
end the relative isolation of the last administration, led by the
autocratic former prime minister, Vladimir Meciar.
	   ``None of us can predict what the country's economy will be like
in 2006. But our plans are firm. We have prepared two budgets. One
covers the organization of the games and that is dlrs 583 million.
The country has to invest about dlrs 1.1 billion into its
infrastructure,'' Benko said.
	   Financing for those improvements is to be covered jointly by the
central government, municipalities and the private sector.
	   More than 90 percent of the residents of the Poprad region,
where Slovakia would hold the Games, showed their support in a
referendum for the organization of the Olympic Games 2006.
	   Newly appointed Prime Minister Mikulas Dzurinda met with the
representatives of the IOC evaluation commission on Saturday, only
a day after he was appointed in the office, and expressed the
government's support for the bid.
	   ``Dzurinda came 24 hours after he is in the office and gave oral
and written support for the bid,'' said Benko.
	   The IOC team left for Zakopane to look at its preparations. The
team visited Klagenfurt last week.

Severe storm in eastern Russia kills one, injures two
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A severe storm that blew across eastern Russia
with hurricane-force winds killed one person and injured two
others, causing over dlrs 1 million in damage, a news agency
reported Sunday.
	   A 24-year-old man was killed and an 18-year-old woman seriously
injured when high winds blew over a silo Saturday night in the
village of Tyubak-Chiburcha, about 700 kilometers (450 miles) east
of Moscow, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   The woman, who was hit on the head and suffered multiple broken
bones, was airlifted to a hospital where a neurosurgeon operated on
her.
	   High winds in the nearby Elabuzhsky village also knocked over a
pipe, which seriously injured a 22-year-old woman.
	   The winds, blowing at speeds of up to 172 kmph (108 mph) lifted
roofs off houses, knocked out electricity to five districts, and
caused an estimated 26 million rubles (dlrs 1.5 million) of damage
across the Tatarstan and Chuvashi regions.
	   Hundreds of emergency workers began cleaning up after the storm,
and by Sunday electricity was restored everywhere except at a few
farms, ITAR-Tass said.

be built, would be empty after the Olympics,'' Stastny said.
``There are very few of good quality sports centers in the country,
so they would surely be used.''
	   Slovakia's bid for the 2006 Winter Games is its second attempt
in the six years since the country broke off from Czechoslovakia.
The 2002 bid stumbled over financial and organization problems.
	   Other contenders include Sion, Switzerland; Turin, Italy;
Zakopane, Poland; Helsinki, Finland; and Klagenfurt, Austria. The
2006 host city will be selected by the IOC on June 19, 1999, at its
session in Seoul, South Korea. Sion is considered the early
favorite.
	   Officials admit that Slovakia's bid for the Games is a longshot.
Slovakia's economy is going through a major restructuring. A new
Western-oriented government, which took power last week, hopes to
end the relative isolation of the last administration, led by the
autocratic former prime minister, Vladimir Meciar.
	   ``None of us can predict what the country's economy will be like
in 2006. But our plans are firm. We have prepared two budgets. One
covers the organization of the games and that is dlrs 583 million.
The country has to invest about dlrs 1.1 billion into its
infrastructure,'' Benko said.
	   Financing for those improvements is to be covered jointly by the
central government, municipalities and the private sector.
	   More than 90 percent of the residents of the Poprad region,
where Slovakia would hold the Games, showed their support in a
referendum.
	   Newly appointed Prime Minister Mikulas Dzurinda met with the
representatives of the IOC evaluation commission on Saturday, only
a day after he was appointed in the office, and expressed the
government's support.
	   The IOC team headed on to Zakopane to look at its preparations.
The team visited Klagenfurt last week.

Reports: signs point to arson in Swedish fire that killed 60
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Will be updated from news conference scheduled for 1400 GMT &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GOTEBORG, Sweden (AP) _ As investigators searched for the cause
of a dance-hall fire that killed 60 people, indications were
growing that the blaze was intentionally set, reports said Sunday.
	   ``Foremost is the fact that we haven't found any natural
explanation for the fire, which indicates that it could have been
set,'' prosecutor Ulf Noren, leading the investigation, was quoted
as saying by the newspaper Expressen.
	   The newspaper also reported that police were told just hours
after the devastating blaze that one of the 162 injured claimed to
know who set the fire.
	   Police commissioner Hans Carlsson declined to comment directly
on that report, saying only ``I don't have any perpetrator,''
Expressen said.
	   The fire broke out shortly before midnight Thursday in a
second-floor hall jammed with up to 400 youths, far beyond the
facility's legal capacity of 150. The fire blocked the emergency
exit stairway, forcing panicked dancers to try to escape down the
staircase at the main entrance or leap out of windows.
	   The dance's disc jockey has said he saw smoke in the emergency
exit stairway just below flames exploded through the hall.
	   The fact that the emergency exit was burning ``is a circumstance
that indicates the fire could have been set,'' Ralf Johansson, head
of the Goteborg police technical division, was quoted as telling
the newspaper Aftonbladet.
	   Witnesses have said the emergency exit stairway was crowded with
wooden furniture, Expressen reported.
	   While investigators continued their work, friends and relatives
of the victims wrestled with grief.
	   The horror fell especially hard on the Shaker family:
12-year-old Jasmin Shaker and her sister, 17-year-old Meriam, both
died in the fire and another sister, Shirin, 13, is hospitalized
with injuries. Meriam had escaped the blazing hall, but died when
she went back in to try to save Jasmin.
	   Like the Shaker girls, many of the victims were immigrants from
troubled countries, or children of immigrant parents.
	   ``We left Iraq 18 years ago. We didn't want our children to grow
up with war and bombs. And then this happens,'' the girls' uncle,
Hassan Bakir, was quoted as saying in Expressen.

 &UR; Outrage over police brutality after crackdown on Christian village &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photo CAI108 &QL; 
 &UR; By ANTHONY SHADID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   EL-KUSHEH, Egypt (AP) _ It began inconspicuously. Two young
Christians killed in a poor region of Egypt known for its vendettas
and guns.
	   The police crackdown that followed in the mostly Christian
farming town wasn't commonplace, however. Villagers, human rights
groups and church officials say hundreds were arrested in a
monthlong campaign of terror that included torture, threats of
rape, hostage-taking and even bribes to officers for lenient
treatment.
	   The story has struck a nerve in Egypt and abroad because it
touches on a sensitive matter: the status of Egypt's small and
sometimes vulnerable Christian minority.
	   But beneath the charges and recriminations may rest a bigger
question about abuses by a powerful security force that fought and
defeated Islamic militants. Many say it now seems to act as a law
unto itself, with little oversight and less accountability.
	   ``It is not a matter of national unity,'' said Rifaat el-Said,
an Egyptian opposition leader. ``It is a matter of the behavior of
the police and a matter of human rights.''
	   The ordeal began with the overtones of religious strife, a
specter that hangs ominously over southern Egypt and its Coptic
Christian minority. For years, Muslim militants occasionally
targeted them as part of their insurgency against the government
that has cost more than 1,250 lives since 1992.
	   The two men, aged 25 and 27, were found dead in front of a
village school in August. Human rights groups and villagers said
police feared the killer was Muslim and were wary of the
repercussions that might have on a town 70 percent Christian and 30
percent Muslim. Police, they said, wanted a Christian suspect.
	   In ensuing weeks, reports said hundreds were detained, including
elderly residents, women and even an 18-month-old boy taken in with
his mother. Villagers said more than 1,000 were detained; human
rights investigators said it was at least 300.
	   ``The police acted as their temper dictated,'' said Basada
Gabriel Abdel-Masih, a priest in the village.
	   The government says only 14 people were detained as part of ``an
ordinary criminal investigation.'' About a dozen claims of torture
were investigated, and none was found to have occurred, said Nabil
Osman, an Egyptian government spokesman.
	   ``There is no proof that there was torture,'' he said.
	   But at Abdel-Masih's Church of the Angel in el-Kusheh, where
minarets and steeples rise above the dirt roads and squat huts,
villagers in dirty peasant gowns, their faces swarthy from work in
the fields, gathered to show the aftermath of their detention.
	   The ankles and wrists of some still bore the signs of what they
said were cuts from plastic or rough cloth used to string them from
the ceiling. Others showed scars they said were left by electric
shocks to their ears, abdomen and genitals.
	   Boktor Abul-Yamin, a 60-year-old villager who police initially
believed killed the two men, said he received shocks and beatings
until he vomited blood. Police detained his entire family and
threatened to rape his wife and daughters, he said.
	   They also held him for 34 days, he said, then released him when
another Christian was charged.
	   ``They beat me like a donkey,'' said Abul-Yamin. ``Now when I
see a policeman in the street, I think he's a devil. The way he
looks, he's a devil.
	   ``There are no laws in this village.''
	   Sensitive to any criticism of its treatment of Christians, the
government has reacted fiercely to suggestions the police crackdown
was motivated by the villagers' faith.
	   From President Hosni Mubarak down, officials have said the
charges are a plot to discredit Egypt and that no discrimination _
legal or otherwise _ is tolerated against Christians.
	   But critics say missing in the denials is any pledge to curb the
excesses by police, a force the Egyptian Organization of Human
Rights said acted as though they enjoyed ``total immunity from
accountability and punishment.''
	   The crackdown in El-Kusheh follows another widely reported
incident in which the brother of a theft suspect was killed in
custody, reportedly by electrocution. His death provoked a riot in
April in the Nile Delta town of Belqas.
	   ``Security is like a fire,'' warned Milad Hanna, a Coptic
Christian and former lawmaker. ``A small amount is useful and gives
warmth. A big amount engulfs the whole house.''

Police crack down on crime in Cuban capital

	   HAVANA (AP) _ Cuba's National Revolutionary Police banged on the
apartment door at 4 a.m. They roused a pair of prostitutes and
their foreign clients out of their rented rooms and hauled them
down to the station.
	   Then, in an unusual move in a country that has recently
tolerated prostitution, three neighbors who were renting rooms to
hookers were accused of pandering. A dozen people, including the
men who brought the couples to the informal bordello, were charged.
	   ``I didn't ask them what they were going to do. I just rented
the rooms,'' said one of those charged, Maria Garcia, 71, a former
rebel who spent nine months in the Sierra Maestra mountains during
the revolution that brought Fidel Castro to power in 1959.
	   Free on dlrs 2,000 bail until she goes to trial, Garcia could
face up to eight years in prison.
	   Cuban police in recent weeks have cracked down on crime in
Havana, which had seen growing hordes of prostitutes and a surge in
violent acts such as robbery and murder.
	   The streetwalkers who once swarmed around tourist locales _ and
the shadowy men offering cheap cigars and independent taxis _ have
all but disappeared from the streets.
	   Dozens of new white Peugeot police cars patrol nightly, stopping
suspicious vehicles and ordering any prostitutes still bold enough
to go outside to return home.
	   Prostitution is not a crime in Cuba. But a stern order by a
Cuban police officer is usually enough to get anyone off the
street. Cuban authorities occasionally round up prostitutes and put
them on buses back to their provincial hometowns.
	   Pimping and pandering _ making money off a prostitute _ is seen
as a far more serious offense and can mean several years in prison
for repeat offenders.
	   Communist officials see the crackdown as more than a battle
against crime. For them, it is a war on a ``lack of discipline''
threatening to rip the seams of the island's socialist system.
	   Juventud Rebelde, the weekly newspaper of the Union of Young
Communists, recently described criminals as ``enemies of the
Revolution.''
	   Leaders of Havana's ideological neighborhood watch groups _ the
Committees for the Defense of the Revolution _ have met with police
leaders to discuss ways to work together to fight crime.
	   ``There are tendencies and types of crimes never seen before,''
Gen. Jesus Becerra, head of the National Revolutionary Police, told
a gathering of municipal leaders. ``It is becoming more complex.''
	   A Foreign Ministry spokesman, Alejandro Gonzalez, blamed the
growing crime problem on drugs brought into the country by
traffickers trying to use the island as a stepping stone for
smuggling between Colombia and the United States.
	   Still, drug use in Cuba appears to be limited mostly to
marijuana brought in by tourists. A proliferation of prostitutes
and marijuana use in Havana's discotheques prompted police to shut
most of them several weeks ago. The majority remain closed.
	   While the crime rate remains extremely low compared with other
major cities around the world, the sporadic robberies and murders
in Havana have shocked a city where the most common crime a few
years ago was pilfering from government offices and factories.
	   The government does not release crime statistics, but anecdotal
evidence suggests violent acts are on the rise.
	   The strangulation of a Cuban woman in her home during an
apparent robbery on Oct. 9 in particular terrified Havana residents
who for decades never dreamed of being attacked by a fellow
citizen.
	   Police arrested several suspects in the slaying of Esther Nieto
Selles, 35. They did not announce a motive, but said cash, jewelry,
household appliances and clothes were taken from her home.
	   In September, the Italian Embassy confirmed a pair of Italian
men had been shot to death and their bodies abandoned on a beach in
Guanabo. Cuba's government has never commented on the double
homicide and the motive has never been made public.
	   Castro blames growing crime on the influence of capitalism.
	   ``The war against crime is also a war against the imperialist
enemy,'' he told leaders of the Committees for the Defense of the
Revolution during a national congress in September. He said his
government was well prepared to fight crime with ``the force of the
people.''
	   The rise in crime followed the collapse of the Soviet Union at
the beginning of the decade. Cuba was plunged into a severe
economic crisis, and most citizens suffered for several years as
they tried to scrounge enough food to survive.
	   Soon, young women hard pressed to feed their families became
``jinoteras'' _ prostitutes _ catering to foreign tourists. As
tourism boomed, hundreds of other women took to the streets.
	   Prostitution has gotten out of control, said Esteban Lazo, the
local Communist Party leader.
	   ``They are going to do in the revolution,'' he said.

Hamas makes first direct threat against Arafat government
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with reaction from Israeli, Palestinian governments,
minor editing; trims &QL; 
 &UR; By MARIAM SAMI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In what could prove a blow to the fledgling
peace accords, Hamas' military wing on Sunday made its first direct
threat against the government of Yasser Arafat, accusing the
Palestinian leader of treason.
	   All-out conflict between Arafat's government and the radical
Islamic group could make it extremely difficult to move ahead with
the implementation of the Israeli-Palestinian land-for-security
agreement signed Oct. 23 in Washington.
	   The threat comes three days after Arafat put Hamas' spiritual
leader, Sheik Ahmed Yassin, under house arrest, and as the
Palestinians were said to be hunting a top Hamas military leader.
	   ``There is no doubt that Arafat and his repressive security
apparatus have reached the point of treason,'' said the leaflet
signed by Hamas' military arm, Izzedine al Qassam, and faxed to
news organizations. ``Infighting has begun, and no one can put out
its fire.''
	   In the leaflet, Hamas appealed to Arafat to halt an ongoing
crackdown against ``our sons and fighters'' in order to spare
Palestinians ``the horrors ... of civil war.''
	   David Bar-Illan, a top aide to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, had no comment on the leaflet. But as for the peace
accords, he said, ``I don't expect anything will upset the apple
cart.''
	   The Palestinian side, too, said the threat would not affect
moving ahead with the agreement.
	   ``We reject this statement,'' said Palestinian police commander
Ghazi Jabali. ``We are going to keep our commitments.''
	   No Hamas official would publicly vouch for the authenticity of
the leaflet, but the ornate language, style and phrasing were
markedly similar to past communications from Hamas' military wing.
	   Only last week, Yassin said Hamas does not want a bloody
confrontation with the Palestinian Authority. But that was before
the sheik was put under house arrest following a Hamas claim of
responsibility for a failed suicide bombing on Thursday aimed at
Jewish settler children in the Gaza Strip.
	   None of the children was hurt, but an Israeli soldier was killed
when the military jeep he was riding in intercepted the
explosives-rigged car.
	   In the leaflet, Hamas claimed the army jeep, not the school bus,
was its real target.
	   ``We would never target children or the elderly,'' it said.
	   Up until now, Hamas has insisted that its quarrel is only with
Israel, with which it vehemently rejects any peace. However, it has
denounced the peace accords' provisions calling for Arafat's
government to move against Islamic militants.
	   Arafat launched the wide-ranging crackdown against Hamas even
before Thursday's attack. In recent days, more than 100 Hamas
activists have been rounded up, including several top leaders.
Among those jailed was the group's spokesman, Mahmoud Zahar.
	   Israel has demanded arrest of Mohammed Deif, one of the military
wing's top leaders. Deif, who is blamed for several terror attacks,
has been in hiding out in Gaza for three years.
	   The Gaza Strip's head of security, Abdel Razak Majaydeh, said
the Palestinian Authority was hunting for Deif, Israel radio
reported. The leaflet specifically warned against capturing him.
	   ``Anyone who allows himself to plan or conspire against the hero
Deif or any of our holy warriors will pay a high price,'' the it
said.
	   Earlier Sunday, before the leaflet appeared, chief Palestinian
negotiator Saeb Erekat expressed hopes that there would not be an
open clash with Hamas.
	   ``If they oppose (the agreement), that's their business, but
they can't do it violently and cross the red line,'' he said.
	   Not everyone in Arafat's government has supported the crackdown.
Communications minister Imad Falouji, a former member of Hamas,
told reporters Saturday he opposed the arrests and would visit
Yassin at home.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with U.N. director leaving, two teams in
field; CHANGES overline.

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The director of U.N. inspection operations
in Iraq, Swedish Maj. Gen. Nils Carlstrom, announced Sunday that he
would leave his post after 18 months on the job.
	   Carlstrom emphasized that his departure had nothing to do with
the current dispute with Iraq over inspections but with the
completion of his third, six-month contract.
	   Meanwhile, two nuclear monitoring teams went into the field on
Sunday, a day after the government said it was ending almost all
cooperation with U.N. weapons teams.
	   Carlstrom, who is to leave Iraq on Monday, said his deputy,
Jaakko Ylitalo would be acting director in Baghdad. Ylitalo, a
Finn, has worked with U.N. inspection teams for six years.
	   Carlstrom confirmed that two teams from the Vienna-based
International Atomic Energy Agency conducted monitoring activities
on Sunday.
	   But experts from the U.N. Special Commission, which looks for
biological and chemical weapons as well as long-range missiles,
were not sent out after Iraq's Saturday announcement that it was
halting cooperation with UNSCOM.
	   ``We are in the office and waiting further instructions on what
to do'' from UNSCOM headquarters in New York, Carlstrom said.
	   He also said that the United Nation's monitoring cameras and
sensors continued to function. Iraq had said Saturday it would not
require the equipment to be dismantled.
	   Carlstrom said cameras often are trained on key pieces of
equipment or on storage areas to ensure material was not being

can be checked for chemical residues or radioactivity.
	   Iraq announced Saturday that it was halting all cooperation with
UNSCOM. But it said the monitors from the International Atomic
Energy Agency, who monitor Iraq's nuclear programs, could continue
to work.
	   Iraq's decision drew a strong condemnation from the U.N.
Security Council, which termed it ``a flagrant violation'' of
council resolutions and of an understanding between Iraq and U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
	   The written understanding averted military action against Iraq
in February over the inspection of Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's
palaces.
	   Iraq's action Saturday was a further step in its battle to try
to force the U.N. Security Council to declare UNSCOM's work
complete and to lift punishing trade sanctions imposed to punish
Iraq for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   On Aug. 5, Iraq said UNSCOM and the IAEA could conduct no more
spot inspections but could continue monitoring work at previously
declared sites. Saturday's decision eliminated even that for
UNSCOM.
	   Iraq said it would not back down until the Security Council
pledges to begin moving to lift the sanctions. It also demanded
that Richard Butler, head of UNSCOM, be removed.

Yugoslavia's defense minister says NATO and OSCE welcome
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Yugoslavia's defense minister says
he expects no trouble with the coming international peace missions
in Kosovo but warns against possible provocations by ethnic
Albanians in the province.
	   Pavle Bulatovic, in an interview to Belgrade-based BK television
late Saturday, said Yugoslav army will cooperate fully with the
deal reached by U.S. peace envoy Richard Holbrooke and Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic to deploy 2,000 people to verify
compliance on the ground and to allow NATO planes to monitor the
province from the air.
	   The missions are to verify if Milosevic keeps his promise to
stop crackdown on Kosovo Albanian separatists and pull out an
excess of government troops from the province.
	   ``The presence of verifiers from the Organization of Security
and Cooperation in Europe and overflights by NATO planes will not
be in conflict with Yugoslav Army performing its regular duties,''
like guarding the country's borders, Bulatovic said.
	   He said the whole arrangement had been fully agreed between OSCE
officials and the country's foreign ministry, and that procedure
would require NATO to announce its flights in advance.
	   ``Yugoslav Army is absolutely open for cooperation'' with NATO,
Bulatovic said, adding the required withdrawal of federal army
troops and police units ``is already being carried out according to
plan.''
	   ``The only thing we can be afraid of is that terrorists can make
a provocation harmful for the OSCE representatives.. but our bodies
will do everything to prevent that,'' Bulatovic said, referring to
Kosovo Albanian pro-independence guerrillas.
	   The NATO and OSCE missions were agreed after much pressure on
Milosevic and largely welcomed by Kosovo Albanians. Yugoslav
officials, however, have warned that ethnic Albanians could
deliberately cause an incident, blame it on Yugoslav and Serbian
forces and thus provoke a tough NATO reaction against Serbs.
	   Milosevic agreed to the NATO and OSCE missions only after
threats that the alliance would intervene directly to stop the
government troops onslaught against ethnic Albanians.

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The director of U.N. inspection operations
in Iraq announced Sunday that he would leave his post after 18
months on the job, a move he said had nothing to do with the
current dispute over the weapons inspectors.
	   Swedish Maj. Gen. Nils Carlstrom said he was leaving because his
third, six-month contract was ending.
	   Meanwhile, two nuclear monitoring teams went into the field on
Sunday, a day after the government said it was ending almost all
cooperation with U.N. weapons teams.
	   Carlstrom, who is to leave Iraq on Monday, said his deputy,
Jaakko Ylitalo would be acting director in Baghdad. Ylitalo, a
Finn, has worked with U.N. inspection teams for six years.
	   Carlstrom confirmed that two teams from the Vienna-based
International Atomic Energy Agency conducted monitoring activities
on Sunday.
	   But experts from the U.N. Special Commission, which looks for
biological and chemical weapons as well as long-range missiles,
were not sent out after Iraq's Saturday announcement that it was
halting cooperation with UNSCOM.
	   ``We are in the office and waiting further instructions on what
to do'' from UNSCOM headquarters in New York, Carlstrom said.
	   He also said that the United Nation's monitoring cameras and
sensors continued to function. Iraq had said Saturday it would not
require the equipment to be dismantled.
	   Carlstrom said cameras often are trained on key pieces of
equipment or on storage areas to ensure material was not being
misused. The sensors, he said, collected air and water samples that
can be checked for chemical residues or radioactivity.
	   Iraq announced Saturday that it was halting all cooperation with
UNSCOM. But it said the monitors from the International Atomic
Energy Agency, who monitor Iraq's nuclear programs, could continue
to work.
	   Iraq's decision drew a strong condemnation from the U.N.

Bad loans in Chinese institutions could spell wider troubles
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo HK101 &QL; 
 &UR; By TARA SUILEN DUFFY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ They funded China's drive towards
modernization, building power plants, new roads, and flashy real
estate developments that were touted as the pride and glory of
provincial governments.
	   But the plants are generating more electricity than the market
needs, the roads have only a handful of drivers on them, and the
properties have few tenants.
	   It all adds up to a financial nightmare for the companies who
lent money on the projects. They're struggling with billions of
dollars of foreign debt and one big one has been closed by the
central government _ an admission that it went bust by ill-fated
attempts to build up China's infrastructure.
	   The plight of China's non-bank financial institutions, known as
international trust and investment corporations, or itics, has
rattled investor sentiment in a region that's already fighting hard
to bounce back from its economic crisis.
	   And some analysts warn that the troubles are just the tip of the
iceberg, with problems in Chinese banks likely to emerge next.
	   ``Itics are in worse shape than banks, but banks are not in good
shape either,'' said Andy Xie, a Hong Kong-based economist who
follows China for the Wall Street investment bank Morgan Stanley.
	   Sooner rather than later, China will have to address not only
its non-bank financial institutions, which make up just 3 percent
of the financial system, but the banks themselves, Xie predicted.
	   For now, concerns have centered on China's approximately 240
itics, which act largely as provincial government investment arms.
They are run mainly by politicians, rather than financial
professionals. Many of them secured foreign funding for provincial
government projects by using official backing to gain the trust of
foreign bankers.
	   But critics say many of the itic projects were developed not
because they were financially viable, but because they reflected
the demands of government officials who were more concerned about
having impressive developments in their territories.
	   It leaves investors wondering whether that official backing will
lead to public cash being used to pay off the bad loans _ or
whether they'll have to take the losses from their bad decisions.
	   Earlier this month, China's central bank stunned the financial
world by abruptly ordering the closure of the debt-laden Guangdong
International Trust and Investment Corp. The closure was largely
seen as a part of Premier Zhu Rongji's reform program that includes
cracking down on corruption and unhealthy financial dealings.
	   The company is now in the hands of liquidators, and it remains
unclear whether it can repay debts that are reported at U.S. dlrs 2
billion. Gitic executives did not return repeated phone calls from
The Associated Press.
	   Taking the long view, economists have lauded China's decision to
shut Gitic as a step in the direction of sound financial
management.
	   But short term, analysts are watching the situation nervously.
They say foreign banks could lose the money they invested, and a
credit crunch could worsen as investor confidence is shattered,
making it difficult and expensive even for sound Chinese companies
to obtain loans.
	   ``What I'm worried about is the likely result of how foreign
banks see the nature of guaranteed loans,'' said banking analyst
Raymond Lee at Salomon Smith Barney.
	   While China could repay the itics' foreign debt with the
country's massive foreign reserves of more than U.S. dlrs 140
billion, that could undermine Beijing's resolve to clean up the
financial sector.
	   ``The government has the resources to bail them out, but it
cannot,'' Xie said in a telephone interview. ``That's the bottom
line for foreign creditors.''
	   Any government bailout would basically be sanctioning unsound
financial decisions, the economist said.
	   Exactly how much foreign debt the itics have is unclear. Part of
the reason Gitic was shut down and others are on review is that
they circumvented the State Administration for Foreign Exchange,
China's official channel for registering foreign loans. They did
this by borrowing money through offshore subsidiaries, mostly in
Hong Kong.
	   That means that both the itics and the banks are responsible for
the risky lending, economists say.
	   Some 80 banks made loans to Gitic worth a combined dlrs 1.4
billion _ and exposure to other itics is far greater. The Hong
Kong's Monetary Authority says foreign and Hong Kong banks have
U.S. dlrs 5.6 billion in exposure to the itics.
	   The international credit rating agency Moody's just downgraded
its ratings on five itics and is considering downgrading China's
first trust and investment company, China International Trust and
Investment Corp. Rival credit watchers at Standard and Poor's
immediately followed suit, lowering its rating on Gitic's U.S.
dollar bonds.
	   Worse credit ratings for itics means that many Chinese companies
will find it harder to borrow, and even if they can find a lender
their interest payments will be higher, said Dong Tao, an Asia
economist for Credit Suisse First Boston.

Sri Lanka says Tamil tiger rebels may try to set up a base in South
</HEADLINE>
Africa

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Colombo has told Pretoria that
secessionist Tamil Tigers could try to set up a base in South
Africa, Sri Lanka's foreign minister said Sunday.
	   ``The South African government, I am convinced, is taking
serious note of our concerns,'' said Lakshman Kadirgamar, the Sri
Lankan foreign minister in a statement.
	   Kadirgamar said the rebels may try to build a support base among
South Africans of Indian origin. The Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam, who are fighting for a separate homeland for minority Tamils
in Sri Lanka's north and east, have offices in the United Kingdom,
Canada, France, Switzerland and other western countries and close
ties with ethnic Tamils in neighboring India.
	   The U.S. government added the LTTE to its list of banned
terrorist groups last year. The ban prevents rebels from raising
funds in the United States and its members from entering that
country.
	   The rebels claim that they are discriminated by the majority
Sinhalese who control the government and the military.
	   More than 54,000 people have been killed in Sri Lanka's civil
war since 1983.

	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ An oil tanker flying the Maltese flag
caught fire at Beirut port Sunday but the vessel's crew was
rescued, port officials reported.
	   One of the sailors from the tanker Giovanna was hospitalized
with burns and respiratory problems caused by smoke, the officials
said. They said a Lebanese fisherman also suffered burns when he
jumped from his boat in panic.
	   The fire spread to a ship carrying cattle that was docked
nearby, but that blaze was extinguished before any animals were
harmed.
	   The fire aboard the tanker raged for about nine hours before it
was finally put out in the early afternoon, the officials said. A
huge black cloud covered the Lebanese capital while the tanker
burned.
	   Lt. Col. Ghassan Balaa, chief of the Beirut fire brigade, told
the Associated Press that the fire brigade, backed by the Lebanese
army, fought the blaze with water and chemicals.
	   Salim Ramadan, marketing manager of the Coral Oil Company, a
Lebanese oil distribution firm which contracted for the oil aboard
the tanker, said it carried a 24-man crew of Greeks, Dutch, Poles
and Italians.
	   He identified the ship as the Giovanna and told The AP that some
11,000 tons of oil was emptied out of the tanker before the fire
started about 5 a.m. (0300gmt) Sunday.
	   ``A lot of the cargo ... is still intact. From the time and
quantity being burned, I can tell it's not more than 3,000 tons,''
he said.
	   Neither Ramadan nor Balaa would say what caused the blaze. But
port officials, speaking on customary condition of anonymity, said
the fire probably started from an oil slick.
	   The fire aboard the cattle boat was put out after about an hour.
The identity of that vessel was not immediately known.

	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Kenyan Sammy Korir retained his
Amsterdam marathon title Sunday in a time of 2 hours 8 minutes and
13 seconds, 11 seconds inside his winning time last year.
	   And Irishwoman Catherina McKiernan was the unchallenged winner
of the women's race, posting a time of 2:22.22 and chopping a
minute and 22 seconds off her personal best.
	   Korir shook off the final challenge from compatriot Simon Bor

Amsterdam's Vondelpark.
	   Bor finished second in 2:08.46, improving his personal best by

home third in 2:09.59.
	   Korir's time was outside his personal best of 2:08.02 but
improved the course record he set last year of 2:08.24.
	   Much-fancied Spaniard Martin Fiz was forced to drop out of the
race.
	   Weather conditions were better than organizers had feared after
a week of almost constant rain, and it was dry at the start.
	   But rain during the race and gusting wind meant sponsors' prizes
of one million guilders (dlrs 500,000) waiting for world best times
in both the men's and women's races stayed safe.

<TEXT>
	   SUZUKA, Japan (AP) _ When Finland's Mika Hakkinen heard he had
clinched his first Formula One championship, he wanted to burst
into song.
	   That would have to wait, though, because the news came to
Hakkinen in the cockpit of his McLaren car with 19 laps left in the
season-ending Japanese Grand Prix.
	   Hakkinen secured the title Sunday when German star Michael
Schumacher dropped out on the 32nd lap, running third when the
right rear tire on his Ferrari exploded.
	   The McLaren team told Hakkinen of Schumacher's fate over their
radio.
	   ``It was a situation where you nearly start singing in the car
because you know you have won the championship at that time. It was
just fun,'' Hakkinen said.
	   Even without the season championship at stake, he went on to win
the race, his eight victory this year.
	   ``It's taken us quite a long time at McLaren to reach this
position and when that happens you look back at what we've done
together. You think of all the hard work done by designers,
mechanics,'' said Hakkinen, who many thought would never race again
after a near-fatal crash in Australia at the end of the 1995
season.
	   For Schumacher, who qualified first Saturday, the day began with
a disaster and only got worse.
	   The two-time Formula One champion was forced to start from the
back of the field after a stuck clutch stalled the engine on his
Ferrari on the second attempt to begin the race. On the first
attempt, Italy's Jarno Trulli stalled on the grid, forcing
officials to abort the start.
	   ``It's a big disappointment. You work so hard Friday, Saturday
and then you have such a tiny little problem that stalls your
engine. And you sit there and can't do anything and have to start
from the back, which is not funny,'' said Schumacher.
	   Hakkinen said, ``They told me they are going to put him on the
back of the grid and I thought, `Wow! That's nice.'''
	   It meant that to win his third championship, the German would
need to overtake 20 cars on a track known for difficult passing,
and would also need Hakkinen to finish no better than third.
	   Hakkinen led all 51 laps on the 5.864-kilometer (3.636-mile)
Suzuka Circuit. Schumacher's Ferrari teammate, Eddie Irvine,
finished second, 6.4 seconds back. McLaren's David Coulthard was
third.
	   ``It was easier than some of the racing has been in the past
this year,'' Hakkinen said.
	   At the beginning, Schumacher made it look like he just might
pull off a miracle.
	   He moved up easily to 12th after only one lap. And by the fifth
lap, he had advanced to seventh place.
	   But as he moved into the heavier traffic toward the front of the
field, passing became more difficult.
	   Schumacher struggled to get ahead of sixth-place Damon Hill, at
one point narrowly avoiding rear-ending the Jordan driver. Once
past Hill, he quickly moved up to third.
	   At the front, meanwhile, Hakkinen widened his lead and was 25
seconds ahead of Schumacher when the German had to drop out.
	   ``Life goes on and now we must look forward to trying again next
season,'' said Schumacher.
	   With his German rival out, the championship belonged to
Hakkinen. And with a comfortable lead over second-place Irvine, he
slowed down.
	   ``It was no rush,'' said the 30-year-old Finn, when asked why
his lap times had dropped.
	   Hakkinen finished with 100 points, 14 more than Schumacher, and
led McLaren to its eighth constructor's title. He is the second
Finn to win the title, following Williams' Keke Rosberg in 1982.
	   Coulthard was third with 56 points, and Irvine fourth with 47.
McLaren had 156 points, followed by Ferrari at 133 and Williams at
38.
	   Back in Finland, ``people had tears in their eyes, and the roof
nearly blew off,'' said Tarja Timonen, a waitress at a restaurant
in Helsinki. Fans crowded restaurants and pubs in the early hours
of Sunday to watch the race.
	   But in Italy, the thousands of Ferrari fans who had gathered
before dawn in the team's hometown of Maranello to watch on a huge
outdoor screen were bitterly disappointed.
	   ``We (Ferrari) have paid billions (millions of dollars) to a
driver who is unable to start the car, and always makes mistakes in
decisive moments,'' said one fan, who had traveled from Rome to
Maranello hoping for a victory celebration.
	   Still, Giovanni Agnelli, honorary chairman of Italy's auto giant
Fiat, Ferrari's parent company, said Schumacher ``still had an
impressive performance. ... He did everything possible.''

Hamas makes first direct threat against Arafat government

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Hamas' military wing on Sunday made its first
direct threat against the government of Yasser Arafat, accusing the
Palestinian leader of treason in a move that could signal trouble
for the recent Mideast peace agreement.
	   All-out conflict between Arafat's government and the radical
Islamic group could make it extremely difficult to move ahead with
the implementation of the Israeli-Palestinian land-for-security
agreement signed Oct. 23 in Washington.
	   The threat comes three days after Arafat put Hamas' spiritual
leader, Sheik Ahmed Yassin, under house arrest, and as the
Palestinians were said to be hunting a top Hamas military leader.
	   ``There is no doubt that Arafat and his repressive security
apparatus have reached the point of treason,'' said the leaflet
signed by the Hamas military arm, the Izzedine al Qassem brigades,
and faxed to news organizations. ``The beginning of infighting has
appeared, and no one can put out its fire.''
	   In the leaflet, Hamas appealed to Arafat to halt an ongoing
crackdown against ``our sons and fighters'' in order to spare
Palestinians ``the horrors...of civil war.''
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office declined to
comment on the leaflet until its authenticity could be verified to
its satisfaction. However, the ornate language, style and phrasing
were extremely similar to past communications from Hamas' military
wing.
	   A senior Palestinian security official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, also declined immediate comment.
	   Only last week, Yassin said Hamas does not want a bloody
confrontation with the Palestinian Authority. But that was before
the sheik was put under house arrest following a Hamas claim of
responsibility for a failed suicide bombing on Thursday aimed at
Jewish settler children in the Gaza Strip.
	   None of the children was hurt, but an Israeli soldier was killed
when the military jeep he was riding in intercepted the
explosives-rigged car.
	   In the leaflet, Hamas claimed the army jeep, not the school bus,
was its real target.
	   ``We would never target children or the elderly,'' it said.
	   Until now, Hamas has insisted that its quarrel is only with
Israel, with which it vehemently rejects any peace. However, it has
denounced the peace accord's call for Arafat's government to move
concertedly against Islamic militants.
	   Arafat launched the wide-ranging crackdown against Hamas even
before Thursday's attack. In recent days, more than 100 Hamas
activists have been rounded up, including several top leaders.
Among those jailed was the group's spokesman, Mahmoud Zahar.
	   Israel has demanded the dismantling of Hamas' military wing and
also the arrest of Mohammed Deif, one of its leaders. Deif, who is
blamed for several terror attacks, has been in hiding in Gaza for
three years.
	   The Gaza Strip's head of security, Abdel Razak Majaydeh, said
the Palestinian Authority was working to apprehend Deif, Israel
radio reported.
	   ``Anyone who allows himself to plan or conspire against the hero
Deif or any of our holy warriors will pay a high price,'' the
leaflet said. ``There is no room for self-control or silence any
more.''
	   Earlier Sunday, before the leaflet appeared, chief Palestinian
negotiator Saeb Erekat expressed hopes that there would not be an
open clash with Hamas.
	   ``I hope all of the 26 Palestinian parties understand that
everyone is allowed to work within the rule of law. If they oppose
(the agreement), that's their business, but they can't do it
violently and cross the red line,'' he said.
	   Not everyone in Arafat's government has supported the crackdown.
Communications minister Imad Falouji, a former member of Hamas, on
Saturday said he opposed the arrests and would visit Yassin at
home.

More than 5,000 rally against planned U.S.-Japan military drills
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ More than 5,000 people rallied in a southwestern
Japanese city Sunday to protest against planned U.S.-Japan joint
military drills, police said.
	   About 800 Japanese troops and 600 American soldiers are
scheduled to start 10-day military exercises Thursday in Kagoshima
and Kumamoto prefectures (states) on Japan's southern main island
of Kyushu.
	   The exercises include shooting and communications drills.
	   Yoshiaki Hidaka, an official of the Ebino police station in
Kagoshima, said the protesters shouted against the exercises and
carried banners saying ``Oppose military bases'' in Kagoshima and
Kumamoto.
	   The protesters staged a rally on the banks of the Kawanai River
in Ebino, 893 kilometers (558 miles) southwest of Tokyo, but there
was no major trouble between protesters and police, he added.
	   The protesters adopted a resolution opposing recently updated
U.S.-Japan defense cooperation guidelines and using land in Kyushu
as a permanent military base, Kyodo News agency reported.
	   The guidelines, updated in September last year, call for Japan
to take a more active and wider military role in cooperation with
the United States during emergencies in unspecified ``areas
surrounding Japan.''

Iraq says it won't back down in standoff over weapons inspections

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ A defiant Iraq said Sunday it would not
back down from its decision to ban U.N. weapons inspectors from
working in the country, even if military action were threatened.
	   Vice President Taha Hussein Ramadan said in a speech opening a
trade fair here that ``there will be no cooperation (with the
inspectors) before Iraq's demands are met.'' He said the country
would maintain its stance ``until the sanctions are lifted.''
	   His comments came a day after the U.N. Security Council issued a
statement condemning Iraq's decision Saturday to cut off all
dealings with arms inspectors as ``a flagrant violation'' of U.N.
resolutions and of an understanding between Iraq and U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
	   Meanwhile Sunday, the director of inspection operations in Iraq,
Swedish Maj. Gen. Nils Carlstrom, announced that he would leave his
post after 18 months on the job.
	   Carlstrom, who was to depart Iraq on Monday, emphasized that his
departure had nothing to do with the current dispute with Iraq but
was due to the completion of his third, six-month contract.
	   He said his deputy, Jaakko Ylitalo, a Finn who has worked with
U.N. inspections teams for six years, would be acting director in
Baghdad.
	   Carlstrom also confirmed that two teams from the Vienna-based
International Atomic Energy Agency, which is charged with
eliminating nuclear weapons, conducted monitoring activities on
Sunday. Iraq exempted the IAEA from its ban.
	   Experts from the U.N. Special Commission, which looks for
biological and chemical weapons as well as long-range missiles,
were not sent out after Iraq's Saturday announcement that it was
halting Annan cooperation with UNSCOM.
	   ``We are in the office and waiting further instructions on what
to do'' from UNSCOM headquarters in New York, Carlstrom said.
	   He also said that the United Nations' monitoring cameras and
sensors continued to function. Iraq had said Saturday it would not
require the equipment to be dismantled.
	   The U.N. sanctions, imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of
Kuwait, limit the sale of oil and other trade activities and have
devastated Iraq's economy.
	   They cannot be lifted until U.N. inspectors certify that Iraq
has eliminated its weapons of mass destruction. Iraq insists it has
done so, but inspectors say Baghdad continues to hide information,
especially about biological and chemical weapons.
	   The written understanding with Iraq brokered by Annan in
February averted military action over the country's refusal to
allow inspectors into the palaces of Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein.
	   The council on Saturday also repeated its offer to review Iraq's
compliance with U.N. resolutions if it resumes cooperation with
weapons inspectors.
	   ``Iraq rejects the latest U.N. Security Council statement and
will not back down,'' Ramadan told reporters at the trade fair.
	   Asked about the possibility of military action to force Iraq to
cooperate, Ramadan said: ``Iraq does not fear the threat of the
United States because it has been threatening Iraq for the past
eight years.''
	   Iraq's decision halts all activities of the U.N. Special
Commission _ which is charged with eliminating Iraq's chemical and
biological weapons as well as long-range missiles _ in Iraq.
	   In effect, that means stopping UNSCOM monitors from visiting
already inspected weapons sites, a practice that was allowed to
continue even after Iraq blocked inspections of new suspected
arms-making sites in August.
	   Iraq has also demanded that Richard Butler, the chief weapons
inspector, be dismissed.

Iraq has no choice, Britain says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Iraq has no choice but to permit U.N. weapons
inspections, and must face the consequences if it continues to
obstruct the inspectors, British Defense Secretary George Robertson
said Sunday.
	   Robertson told Independent Radio News that Saddam Hussein
appeared to be ``in open defiance'' of the United Nations, after
Iraq's announcement Saturday that it was breaking off dealings with
the United Nations Special Commission.
	   ``All the options would be considered very carefully before
anything was done to Iraq,'' Robertson said Sunday. ``But what Iraq
must understand is it has no choice in this matter, it must comply
with the U.N. Security Council regulations or face the
consequences.''
	   The Iraqi action followed a Security Council decision Friday to
review Iraq's compliance with U.N. resolutions without a guarantee
demanded by Iraq that the review must lead to the lifting of trade
sanctions.
	   In Washington on Saturday, National Security Council spokesman
David Leavy said, ``all options remain on the table'' in dealing
with the Iraqis.
	   President Bill Clinton made clear his administration's
determination to continue economic sanctions against Iraq as a
means of supporting the U.N. effort to locate weapons of mass
destruction believed to be concealed inside Iraq.
	   The sanctions cannot be lifted until the U.N. inspectors certify
that Iraq has eliminated the weapons. Iraq insists it has done so,
but inspectors says Baghdad continues to hide information,
especially about biological and chemical weapons.

	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ Giant plumes of black smoke engulfed an
eastern neighborhood in this violent port city on Sunday as
activists of a minority ethnic party and police clashed, said
eyewitnesses and police.
	   There were no immediate report of injuries.
	   Scores of shops were set on fire and smoldering cars blocked
roads as security troops fired tear gas shells to disperse
demonstrators protesting the arrest of at least 200 party members,
along with five top leaders.
	   Supporters of the smaller Haqiqi faction of the former Mohajir
Qami Movement hurled stones at police, burned tires, blocked roads
and fired automatic weapons in the congested eastern Landhi
neighborhood to protest a police raid on a meeting at their party
headquarters.
	   The Haqiqi group is a splinter group of the Muttaheda Qami
Movement, led by exiled leader Altaf Hussein.
	   Both MQM factions say they speak for the political and economic
rights of Urdu speaking people who migrated from India in 1947 when
British colonial rule of the subcontinent ended. The main MQM
faction, led by Hussein, was a coalition partner of Sharif's
Pakistan Muslim League in Sindh.
	   Sharif's party did not have the majority needed to form a
government in Sindh without the support of the MQM.

New attack on bus driver on eve of Paris transport strike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ Bus drivers went on strike Sunday in
the northern part of this port city after thieves assaulted a
colleague, tying him up at gunpoint and stealing money in the
latest attack on transport workers.
	   The attack, at an administrative office of a city depot,
occurred on the eve of a transport strike in the Paris region by
workers demanding better security after a string of violent
attacks.
	   The assailants, two armed men with their faces masked, stole
about 200,000 francs (dlrs 33,000).
	   Bus drivers also held a brief strike in Marseille, France's
second city, on Friday after a passenger who was demanding to get
off between regular stops attacked a driver who was later
hospitalized.
	   It has been a similar scenario across France in recent weeks.
Transit workers say the government has failed to address the need
for better security on public transport in the face of worsening
youth violence.
	   The rising crime is blamed on youths from working-class suburbs,
who've been hit hard by double-digit unemployment. While the
national jobless rate is 11.7 percent, the rate can top 50 percent
in some neighborhoods.
	   Monday promises to be another trying day for commuters in the
Paris region, with high-speed suburban trains, buses and the Metro
all going on strike for 24 hours.
	   Transit workers plan to rally in front of the Finance Ministry
to demand better security and more staff.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ A defiant Iraq said Sunday it would not
back down from its decision to ban U.N. weapons inspectors from
working in the country, even if military action were threatened.
	   Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan said in a speech opening a
trade fair here that ``there will be no cooperation (with the

would maintain this stance ``until the sanctions are lifted.''
	   His comments came the morning after the U.N. Security Council

Iraq stopped inspections of new suspected arms-making sites in
August.
	   The decision exempted monitoring by the Vienna-headquartered

	   On Sunday, two nuclear monitoring teams went into the field,
with the monitors refusing to comment to reporters as they left
their headquarters on the edge of Baghdad.
	   Nils Carlstrom, the director U.N. inspection operations in Iraq,
confirmed the teams were from the IAEA, but said UNSCOM teams would
not be working.
	   ``We are in the office and waiting further instructions on what

deputy would take over from him.

Once again, vandals blow up statue of Russian czar
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Vandals blew up a statue of Russia's last czar
Sunday, the second time in two years a monument to Nicholas II has
been destroyed.
	   The statue destroyed Sunday was in the city of Podolsk, about 25
kilometers (15 miles) south of Moscow. According to the ITAR-Tass
news agency, the statue was destroyed and its foundation partly
damaged in the blast.
	   No one immediately claimed responsibility.
	   In April 1997, a statue of Nicholas II was blown up in the
village of Taininskoye, a Moscow suburb. Both that statue and the
one destroyed Sunday were created by the same sculptor, Vyacheslav
Klykov.
	   Klykov lamented that vandals apparently were ``hunting'' his
statues of Nicholas.
	   ``The church is preparing to canonize him. That means that
vandals blow up not only monuments but our memory of Russian
saints,'' he told ITAR-Tass.

Settlers clear ground for Jewish neighborhood in east Jerusalem

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Amid protests by Israeli peace activists and
Palestinian officials, Jewish settlers began clearing land Sunday
for a new Jewish neighborhood in traditionally Arab east Jerusalem.
	   Long before sunrise, settlers erected a barbed wire fence around
a dusty hilltop that they say is the future site of 132-unit Jewish
settlement in Jerusalem's primarily Palestinian neighborhood of Ras
al Amoud. A tractor cleared away stones and rubble in preparation
for construction.
	   ``This neighborhood has been Jewish for 100 years,'' said Motti
Dan, a leader of the Ateret Cohanim settler group. ``We are
building on private property,'' he said.
	   But Faisal Husseini, the Palestinian Minister for Jerusalem
Affairs, called the construction the first Israeli violation of the
latest peace agreement signed at in Washington.
	   ``What the settlers are doing here is against the peace
agreement, which prohibits unilateral actions that change the
status quo,'' Husseini said.
	   About 15 activists from the Israeli group Peace Now demonstrated
at the site Sunday.
	   ``You are sowing the seeds for the next war,'' the protesters
screamed.
	   Three demonstrators tied themselves to the tractor with a metal
link chain and padlock and scuffled briefly with settlers who tried
to drag them away. Police pulled away the chain and arrested the
demonstrators, along with a fourth activist who threw away the
padlock's key.
	   Israel captured east Jerusalem from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast
war and encouraged Jews to move to the area. The Palestinians want
the area to become the capital of a future independent state. Last
year riots broke out when settlers moved into an existing house
adjacent to the empty lot in Ras al Amoud.
	   Dan said that the group had a permit from the city of Jerusalem
to build on the lot, but had delayed construction while Israelis
and Palestinians hashed out a U.S.-brokered peace agreement in
eastern Maryland.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office issued a statement
saying that while construction does not violate the Wye Agreement,
the government retained its right to approve or veto the building
permit.
	   ``The fence does not mean permission has been given to build,''
the statement said. ``That remains the prerogative of the
government which still has not given such permission.''

Guinea-Bissau leaders locked in private talks in Nigeria
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ The leaders of Guinea-Bissau's warring
sides met behind closed doors Sunday for a third day in a bid to
resolve the West African country's bitter five-month long civil
war.
	   The talks between President Joao Bernardo Vieira and Brig.
Ansumane Mane were veiled in secrecy at the mansion of Nigeria's
military leader, Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar.
	   The antagonists met with a committee of West African leaders
from nine countries including Abubakar throughout the day and
evening Saturday and began again early Sunday, a government
official said on condition of anonymity.
	   It was not clear how long the talks would last and one of the
mediators, Togo's President Gnassigbe Eyadema, told journalists on
Saturday that both Vieira and Mane had pledged to remain at the
table until they hashed out a deal.
	   The talks began in Gambia's capital of Banjul on Friday and the
venue was moved to Nigeria's capital early Saturday to coincide
with a summit of leaders from the Economic Community of Western
States.
	   The two-day ECOWAS summit closed on Sunday night with a written
appeal by the organization for the warring parties to resolve their
differences peacefully.
	   ECOWAS has on several occasions intervened in regional disputes.
Nigeria, the region's powerhouse, leads a West African force called
ECOMOG that played an aggressive role in ended fighting in Liberia
in 1996 and toppling Sierra Leone's junta in March.
	   The conflict in the former Portuguese colony began June 7 when a
breakaway faction of disgruntled military veterans seized the main
army garrison and international airport in the capital Bissau.
	   The rebels accused Vieira of corruption and have demanded that
he step down.
	   Although Senegal and Republic of Guinea sent troops to Vieira's
aid, the insurgents have overrun most of the small country.
	   About half of the country's 1 million people have been displaced
by the fighting, although no one knows how many people were killed
and wounded.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Villagers fearing mystery assassins
beat three plainclothes policemen to death after being roused to
action by the shouts of a suspected dealer in stolen goods,
Indonesia's official news agency reported Sunday.
	   The beatings occurred in area of East Java where more than 150
people _ Muslim preachers or people suspected of dabbling in black
magic _ have been killed in the last few months by assassins said
to dress in ninja-like black clothing.
	   In turn, vigilante groups have lynched a number of suspected
murderers.
	   The Antara news agency said villagers responded to shouts of
``Ninja'' as nine plainclothes officers approached the house of a
suspected collector of stolen goods in Bangkalan, on Madura Island,
off eastern Java.
	   The policemen tried unsuccessfully to stop the attackers by
showing their police credentials, Antara said. It said one sergeant
was fatally beaten Saturday night and, after an initial escape, two
others were found and killed Sunday.
	   All the victims were member of the police force in Surabaya, the
East Java capital and Indonesia's second largest city, about 400
miles (650 kilometers) east of Jakarta.
	   Amid growing fear and anger over the mystery killings, police
have rounded up 131 people, many of them mentally ill, to protect
them from the revenge.
	   Earlier, mobs lynched half a dozen other suspected murderers
this week on Java. In some cases, mobs have tried to seize suspects
from police custody.
	   Some Muslim leaders believe the murders are politically
motivated.
	   Many of the victims were Muslim clerics of Nahdlatul Ulama,
Indonesia's largest Muslim group, which has formed its own
political party to run in elections next year.
	   The group has warned it will deploy its own security forces if
the military does not restore order soon.

U.S. official says fear still hindering return of refugees
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Fear of Serb police and Yugoslav
soldiers continues to prevent refugees from returning home, though
significant progress has occurred in implementing the Kosovo peace
deal, a senior U.S. official said Sunday.
	   After visiting two villages in western Kosovo and meeting with a
range of relief officials, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Julia
Taft said conditions in the war-torn province were much better than
during her previous visit two months ago.
	   While many of the 50,000 or more refugees who had been living in
the woods have returned to villages, some still were staying away
from their homes, she said.
	   ``It's difficult to say that everybody is able to go back home
or is willing to go back home,'' Taft told a news conference.
``There is fear among the population.''
	   She saw that fear firsthand earlier, during a visit to an ethnic
Albanian compound in the foothills south of Pec, 100 kilometers (60
miles) west of Pristina.
	   Family members complained that Serb police harass them, arrest
people and make them feel unsafe, despite the Oct. 12 agreement
between Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and U.S. envoy
Richard Holbrooke to bring peace to the province.
	   They said only international troops, not the unarmed foreign
verification force being created, could solve their problem.
	   ``The Westerners are not going to solve the problem,'' Taft told
the family. ``The people who live here must come to an agreement to
solve their problem.''
	   But the head of the family, who asked that his name not be used
because he feared retribution by Serb police, told her: ``I don't
think that it will be possible.''
	   Taft later said Serb police had decreased their visibility,
noting she passed only three checkpoints during her travels Sunday,
compared to the dozens that used to exist.
	   Acknowledging that even a small police presence concerned
residents, she called the creation of a civilian police force in
Kosovo a ``high priority'' for the international community.
	   ``My sense is that until there is a credible civilian police
presence in the villages and towns, you won't have the confidence
necessary'' for people to resume their normal lives, Taft said.
	   She also expressed concern for reports that Serb police and
ethnic Albanian guerrillas were detaining people.
	   Western powers led by the United States threatened NATO
airstrikes to force Milosevic to reach the Oct. 12 agreement that
calls for him to withdraw police and military forces to levels
before a February crackdown on Albanian separatists.
	   The agreement also provides for full access for relief agencies
and a 2,000-member unarmed ``ground verification mission'' that
will verify compliance with the deal.
	   NATO spy planes also will overfly the country, and a
rapid-reaction force is to be set up in neighboring Macedonia. In
Italy, U.S. Navy spokesman Capt. Steve Burnett said Navy P-3C
Orions would begin regular surveillance flights over Kosovo this
week.
	   Taft said the ground verification mission, being set up by the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, would have an
``intrusive'' presence in Kosovo to make sure Serb forces comply.
	   Yugoslavia's defense minister said he expects no trouble with
the coming international peace mission, but he warned against
possible provocations by ethnic Albanians.
	   Pavle Bulatovic, in an interview to Belgrade-based BK television
late Saturday, said the Yugoslav army will cooperate fully with the
Milosevic-Holbrooke agreement.
	   ``The presence of verifiers ... and overflights by NATO planes
will not be in conflict with Yugoslav Army performing its regular
duties,'' like guarding the country's borders, Bulatovic said.
	   ``The only thing we can be afraid of is that terrorists can make
a provocation harmful for the OSCE representatives,'' he said,
referring to the guerrilla Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   Yugoslav officials warn such a provocation would be intended to
get NATO to react against the Serbs, who might get blamed for any
harm to OSCE observers.

Singapore PM wants better relations with Malaysia, within ASEAN
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said Sunday he
wants to discuss with other Southeast Asian leaders how to make
their association more cohesive in the midst of the economic crisis
because he fears it will lose international influence.
	   At a summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in
Hanoi, Vietnam, in December, Goh said he would like to ``discuss
how the ASEAN leaders can make ASEAN more cohesive and retain its
influence.''
	   ``I think ASEAN is going through a crisis because of the
economic crisis and if ASEAN is not seen to be working together as
a cohesive unit, ASEAN will lose some stature internationally,''
Goh said.
	   In offhand remarks to reporters, Goh also said Singapore wants
its tense relations with Malaysia to get ``back on keel'' and that
there had been recent improvement, government television reported.
	   Goh said he and Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad ``have
no problem on a personal level, but he has to look after Malaysia's
interest and I have to look after Singapore's interest.''
	   Both countries are ASEAN members and once were unified in the
Malay Federation. The neighbors have argued since August over the
location of a border post, a cancellation of automatic flyover
rights for Singaporean military aircraft in Malaysian airspace,
Malaysia's withdrawal from military exercises, and trading of
Malaysian stocks and currencies in Singapore.
	   At the same time, Philippine President Joseph Estrada and
Indonesian President B.J. Habibie have expressed support for Anwar
Ibrahim, the jailed former deputy prime minister who has called for
Mahathir's resignation since being fired on Sept. 2. The
Philippines and Indonesia are also members of ASEAN, which has a
longstanding policy of non-interference in member nations' internal
affairs.
	   Singapore, which chairs ASEAN until next July, is a strong
proponent of that policy. Philippine and Thai leaders have said
that more open comment can be tolerated in the group, and that
social problems in one country can often result in strategic
difficulties for neighbors.

Krajicek captured Eurocard Open in straight sets over Kafelnikov
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STUTTGART, Germany (AP) _ Richard Krajicek served with power and
accuracy to beat Yevgeny Kafelnikov 6-4, 6-3, 6-3 and capture the
Eurocard Open for the second time in his career Sunday.
	   The victory brought Krajicek closer to clinching one of the two
last spots still available in the eight-man, season-ending World
Championship in Hanover, Germany.
	   He is now in the eighth position, but there are still three
weeks of tennis before the championship.
	   Krajicek, who had ousted fifth-ranked Andre Agassi and No. 1
Pete Sampras en route to the final, was devastating against
Kafelnikov.
	   ``My serve was very important,'' Krajicek said. ``I returned
well also, you can't win only with serve.''
	   The 26-year-old Dutchman never faced a break point on his serve
and did not give up a single point in his first four service games.
He took the first set with an ace on his second set point and had
21 aces in the match.
	   In the second, Kafelnikov saved two set points but then hit a
forehand long to fall into a two-set deficit.
	   The Russian, No. 10 in the world, dropped his serve again to
leave Krajicek a 2-0 lead and he breezed through the final set,
hitting a backhand volley to break Kafelnikov's serve for the
match.
	   Krajicek, the 1996 Wimbledon champion, entered the tournament
ranked 11th, but his second title of the year is likely to push him
into the top 10 when the new computer rankings come out Monday.
	   Kafelnikov, 24, was playing in his fifth final this year. He has
won two of them.
	   Krajicek's last title was in February this year in St.
Petersburg.
	   He won the title here in 1995 and played in his second
consecutive final in the start-studded dlrs 2.45 million
tournament. The victory earned Krajicek dlrs 376,000, while
Kafelnikov picked up dlrs 198,000.

State government pact brings east German ex-communists back into
</HEADLINE>
power &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL GEITNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Nine years after the collapse of the Berlin Wall,
the successor to East Germany's communist party is moving back into
power as junior coalition partner in an eastern state government
despite nagging doubts about its democratic credentials.
	   Leaders of the ex-communist Party for Democratic Socialism
heralded the pact with the mainstream Social Democrats in
Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania as another step toward establishing
itself as a legitimate leftist party.
	   But conservatives attacked the coalition deal, approved
Saturday, as ``a sad premiere'' for bringing the PDS into a state
government for the first time since German unification.
	   And even some Social Democrats questioned the wisdom of
cooperating with the heirs to East Germany's oppressive regime.
	   ``How are we to look the relatives of those killed at the Wall
in the eye?'' Social Democratic lawmaker Michael Koerner asked at a
party meeting Saturday called to vote on the pact.
	   In the agreement, the PDS admits responsibility for injustices
committed in East Germany and the necessity to compensate victims.
But it also scraps the rule for background checks of public
officials for past ties with the once-dreaded Stasi secret police.
	   Some Social Democrats have quit the party in dismay, and state
party leader Harald Ringstorff said he expected a few more might
follow them.
	   But he and others sought to steer the debate away from recent
history toward what the government hoped to achieve.
	   ``The look to the past should not be the decisive one, rather
that into the future,'' said state Interior Minister Gottfried
Timm.
	   After a sharp debate, the Social Democrats approved the
coalition agreement 63-22 with six abstentions. At their own party
meeting, the PDS also approved the deal Saturday by a vote of
100-6.
	   The pact is to be officially signed Monday and Ringstorff will
be formally voted in as governor in the state parliament Tuesday.
	   The state, north of Berlin on the Baltic coast, had been
governed since 1994 by the conservative Christian Democratic Union,
with the Social Democrats as junior partner in an often fractious
coalition.
	   When the Social Democrats finished on top in elections Sept. 27,
Ringstorff turned to the PDS, which finished third, to form the
necessary majority in parliament.
	   Although his government will be the first to openly work with
the ex-communists _ the party is to get three of eight Cabinet
posts _ the taboo was partially broken early this year in another
eastern state.
	   Social Democrats in Saxony-Anhalt have been keeping their
minority government afloat since the spring with tacit support from
the PDS, but no official coalition.
	   In the west, the PDS has almost no support and is treated as a
political pariah.
	   Yet it consistently garners about 20 percent of the vote in the
east, where many people say they still feel like outsiders in their
own land, looked down on or ignored by the more prosperous west.
	   While ruling out any cooperation on the national level, the
Social Democrats have signaled increasing willingness to accept
such coalitions in the struggling eastern states.
	   However, in an open letter published in this week's Der Spiegel
newsmagazine, four prominent Social Democrats warned that
cooperation with the PDS may end up backfiring.
	   ``The broad majority of east Germans are keeping their distance
from the PDS,'' the authors wrote, adding that granting the PDS
greater legitimacy could end up draining left-wing votes from the
Social Democratic party itself.

Macedonians finish choosing new parliament

	   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) _ An opposition coalition was optimistic
it can oust Macedonia's ex-communist government as polls opened
Sunday in a second round of parliamentary elections in the young
Balkan country.
	   The outcome is important for international peace efforts for
neighboring Kosovo. NATO wants to use Macedonia as a base for
NATO's aerial missions over the province and to station a security
force to protect the 2,000-member ground verification force.
	   The opposition had questioned whether Macedonia should become
involved, even indirectly, in the Kosovo crisis. But the country is
member of NATO's Partnership for Peace and observers say that the
opposition will probably accept the NATO request.
	   More than half the legislature's 120 seats were up for grabs
after the Oct. 18 first round which left the nationalist-reformist
coalition of VMRO-DPMNE and Democratic Alternative with the
advantage.
	   If the opposition forces fail to gain an outright majority in
parliament, the country's ethnic Albanian minority may determine
whether the ruling Social Democrats remain in power, depending on
which party it chooses to ally with.
	   The Social Democrats won just 13 of the 55 seats allocated in
the first round, trailing both the opposition coalition with 21 and
the ethnic Albanians' party with 18. Three seats went to two minor
parties, with 65 left undetermined due to a turnout below the
required one-third of registered voters or, in other areas, no
clear majority.
	   Turnout by Sunday noon was about 20 percent, media reported.
	   Top issues during election campaigns were Macedonia's feeble
economy and disputes with neighbors Bulgaria, Albania and Greece.
	   The opposition blamed the incumbents for the grim state of
economy - average monthly salary at dlrs 210, 30 percent
unemployment and deepening gap between the rich and the poor.
	   The ruling party fought back accusing the opposition of
demagoguery, incompetence and lack of experience.
	   Macedonia gained independence six years ago when the former
Yugoslavia broke up, and is the only ex-Yugoslav republic spared
from war. But tensions are high due to its shared border with
Serbia's Kosovo province, where hundreds have died this year in
fighting between Serbian government troops and Kosovo's ethnic
Albanian separatist guerrillas.
	   Macedonia has its own large and restive community of ethnic
Albanians _ 23 percent of the country's 2 million people. There are
fears they could take up arms to win independence for the western
part of Macedonia, where many of them live and outnumber
Macedonians.

	   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) _ Rescue workers and air force
helicopters set out Sunday for a town in northern Nicaragua that
was hit by massive mudslides, killing at least 58 and pushing the
death toll of former hurricane Mitch to about 460.
	   More than 2,400 people living in the 10 communities at the foot
of the Casitas Volcano were still unaccounted for, Mayor Felicita
Zeledon of Posoltega told the government's Radio Nicaragua. She
said 58 bodies had been pulled from the mud in her town, about 50
miles (80 kms) northwest of Managua.
	   ``It is like a desert littered with buried bodies,'' Zeledon
said, citing reports from rescue workers.
	   Few other details were immediately available. With highways cut
by flooding and poor visibility, authorities had to abandon efforts
Saturday to reach the town of 14,000 near the Honduran border.
	   Air force helicopters lifted off from the Managua's Sandino
airport early Sunday, and a Red Cross team set out by land from
Chinandega, about 18 miles (30 kilometers) to the northwest, for
Posoltega.
	   Zeledon's statements were the first official confirmation of any
deaths from mudslides in the northwestern province of Chinandega,
where radio reports said as many as 4,000 people may have been
killed.
	   Officially, Nicaragua has reported 131 dead from heavy rain and
flash flooding there. Another 151 people are listed as missing in
Nicaragua, the National Civil Defense reported.
	   Nicaragua has asked the United States to lend it several large
helicopters to help deliver aid and assess casualties and damage,
Defense Minister Pedro J. Chamorro Barrios said Saturday.
	   In Honduras, at least 231 people have been confirmed dead from
Mitch, the National Emergency Commission said Saturday.
	   El Salvador _ where 30 people died in flash floods _ declared a
state of emergency Saturday, as did Guatemala, where nine people
died when floodwaters swept away their homes. Mexico reported one
death from Mitch on Monday.
	   Mitch _ once one of the strongest hurricanes to hit the
Caribbean _ was downgraded Saturday to a tropical depression status
but continued to dump heavy rain on the region. By late Saturday,
Mitch's winds _ once near 180 mph (290 kph) _ had dropped to 18 mph
(29 kph) and the storm was located south of Santa Rosa de Copan,
Honduras, moving west at 5 mph (8 kph), the U.S. National Hurricane
Center reported.
	   One hundred and thirty-one people were reported killed in
Tegucigalpa after floodwaters rose to the third floor of some
buildings in the Honduran capital Saturday.
	   ``Superhuman efforts are under way to aid the flood victims,''
said Honduran President Carlos Flores Facusse after he traveled to
Tegucigalpa's international airport aboard a U.S. military
aircraft. Flores Facusse declared the city ``a disaster zone.''
	   In the Caribbean, two U.S. Coast Guard C-130 planes continued
the search for a tourist schooner with 31 people aboard that hasn't
been heard from since Tuesday.
	   States of emergency remained in effect in Honduras and
Nicaragua.
	   With rainfall of 4 inches (10 centimeters) an hour at the height
of the storm, downed bridges, rampant rivers, toppled trees and
mudslides isolated hundreds of communities where food, water and
medicine were in short supply.
	   ``Almost everything is damaged or destroyed and it will be
difficult to recover from such a tragedy,'' said Col. Anael Perez,
spokesman for Honduras' Permanent Emergency Commission, describing
the damage in his country of 6 million.

With farmers on war front, Eritrean office workers help harvest

bumper crop &QL;

<TEXT>
	   ADI GUADAD, Eritrea (AP) _ Long rows of urban professionals
hacked awkwardly at stalks of golden wheat, helping to harvest
bumper crops while farmers-turned-soldiers hunkered down on
Eritrea's southern border, waiting for war to resume.
	   Faced with a shortage of farm workers and worried that rain will
soon fall, the government of this highly nationalistic country has
for the past month been busing professors, mechanics, secretaries
and even judges to the fields each Saturday.
	   ``Most of the farm workers are now at the front,'' said
government researcher Daniel Kasela, nursing a finger he sliced
with a sickle. ``We are more than willing to harvest in place of
those soldiers.''
	   The six-month simmering border conflict between Ethiopia and
Eritrea has forced the government to conscript most young men and
women who would normally be harvesting crops.
	   And migrant farm laborers from northern Ethiopia who
traditionally help with Eritrea's harvest have become the enemy.
	   But a combination of the best crop in 40 years, the manpower
shortage and the loss of food imports from Ethiopia has inspired
Eritreans to embrace an endeavor they excel in _ collective work,
said Tadesse Kiflom, civil aviation development chief.
	   A three-decade struggle to become independent from neighboring
Ethiopia, won in 1993, taught Eritreans to work together.
	   ``It is our culture doing things collectively, but nationalism
is now at its peak,'' said Kasela, the injured researcher.
	   Tadesse said office workers give up precious Saturdays to help
their fellow citizens and to insure a regular supply of food gets
to market, stabilizing prices.
	   Adi Guadad is on the southern outskirts of Asmara, making it
easy for city buses to transport urbanites to the fields.
	   Stefanos Habte, a 51-year-old official in the Transport
Ministry, carried an armful of wheat to a growing mound. Sixteen of
his 20 staff members showed up at 5:30 a.m. on a nippy Saturday to
lend a hand.
	   No formal instructions were given to the office workers, many of
whom dressed in slacks, leather shoes and sweaters, hardly the best
attire for field work. As the sun beat down on the windswept
plains, they learned to cut wheat and barley by doing.
	   Villagers used pitchforks and years of know-how to sculpt the
freshly cut crops into the neat beehive-shaped mounds that dotted
the fields.
	   In border areas hundreds of kilometers (miles) to the south,
farmers displaced from their fields pass idle hours in camps for
the displaced where they survive on charity.
	   ``Now the harvest is ready, but we cannot go back to our farms.
When we were forced to leave, the Ethiopians started taking over
houses,'' said farmer Nigisti Gebrehariat.
	   Although there has been no significant fighting since June,
hundreds of thousands of troops are entrenched on both sides of the
border, frustrating any prospects that these families might have of
returning home any time soon.
	   The United Nations recently said that 100,000 farmers had been
uprooted by the hostilities. A similar number of Ethiopians have
also been displaced.
	   This year's harvest has been exceptional because the government
encouraged peasants to work collectively in huge fields, rather
than on small, scattered plots. Officials also urged the farmers to
rent tractors and buy fertilizer from the government.
	   Many believe this is Eritrea's future. ``I don't see any other
option. I can't see so many people plowing their tiny plots,''
Stefanos said.
	   Since Eritrea does not produce enough food to feed its
population, falling short by about half even in a good year, the
government is trying to increase domestic production while
expanding the industrial sector so it can afford to buy imported
food.
	   More than 80 percent of Eritreans live in rural areas, farming
or herding.
	   Elderly women from Adi Guadad, their faces leathery from years
of field work, burst into cries of joy and dance. Along with the
barrels of homemade beer they will offer the city folk at the end
of the day, this is their humble way of expressing gratitude.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Malaysia's Yong Hock Kin defeated
Indonesian Budi Santoso 15-7, 15-6 Sunday for the men's singles
title of the Indonesia Badminton Open Championship.
	   Playing before more than 7,000 spectators at Jakarta's Senayan
Sports Palace, Kim jumped to an 11-4 lead, allowed Santoso to
collect three points and then took three points in a row to end the
first set in 17 minutes.
	   In the second, Kim surged to a 13-2 lead and yielded only four
more points.
	   Indonesia's 19-year-old Mia Audina defeated Denmark's Mette
Sorensen 11-0, 11-6 for the women's singles title.
	   The first set took only six minutes, the shortest of the
five-day tournament.
	   Sorensen led 2-0 and 4-1 in the second set, but then was nearly
shut out again.
	   Denmark's Michael Sogaard and Rikke Olsen also had to settle for
a runner-up finish, losing 10-15, 15-6, 15-6 to Indonesians Trikus
Heryanto and Minarti Timur in the mixed doubles.
	   The last Danish pair, Marlene Thomsen and Rikke Olsen, lost
7-15, 17-15, 15-7 in the women's doubles final to Indonesians Elyza
and Deyana Lomban.
	   A crippling economic crisis prevented many top world players,
especially from power house China, from entering the tournament,
which offered a total purse of dlrs 120,000.

South African deputy president arrives in Saudi
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ South African Deputy President Thabo
Mbeki arrived in Saudi Arabia Sunday for a three-day trip aimed at
increasing trade between the two nations.
	   Mbeki will meet with Saudi King Fahd and Crown Prince Abdullah,
his office said in a statement.
	   Mbeki is accompanied by a high-level delegation including
Defense Minister Joe Modise and Trade and Industry Minister Alec
Erwin.
	   Mbeki, who became the ruling African National Congress'
president last year and is expected to win the 1999 presidential
elections, is scheduled to meet with Defense Minister Prince Sultan
on Tuesday.
	   He will also visit the industrial cities of Yanbu and Jubail and
meet with members of the Saudi Chamber of Commerce and Industry,
the statement said.
	   The two sides are expected to discuss a much talked about
oil-for-arms deal. The dlrs 1.5 billion sale of G6 motorized
artillery pieces and anti-aircraft weapons to Saudi Arabia, if
finalized, would be the largest arms deal in South African history
and could create 30,000 jobs over five years.
	   Economic relations between the two nations have been growing in
recent years. South Africa is trying to rely less on Iran for oil,
from which it imports more than two-thirds of its crude oil needs,
according to South African press reports.
	   In a visit to Saudi Arabia last year, President Nelson Mandela
signed a preliminary agreement with the oil-rich kingdom which
calls for oil imports of 15,000 barrels a day from Saudi Arabia.
	   The memorandum of understanding also calls for joint efforts to
build new refineries, Mandela had said without giving details.
	   South Africa's exports to Saudi Arabia more than doubled from
dlrs 47 million in 1994 to dlrs 95 million in 1996. Saudi Arabia's
exports, mainly oil, jumped from dlrs 8 million in 1994 to dlrs 207
million in 1996.

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ The government has asked parliament to renew the
10-year term of a law authorizing it to borrow locally and on the
international market, the Al-Qabas daily said Sunday.
	   There were, however, no indications that Kuwait was going to
resort to foreign borrowing in order to bridge a 1.92 billion dinar
(dlrs 6.35 million) net deficit for the fiscal year starting July
1.
	   Oil-rich Kuwait, has, for years, covered its budget shortfalls
with reserves of foreign investments. These investments are
estimated at dlrs 40 billion, down from around dlrs 100 billion in
the 1980s.
	   According to the government's request, which was published in
Al-Qabas, Finance Minister Sheik Ali al-Sabah said the renewal was
needed to ``legalize local borrowing operations,'' such as the
issuing of treasury bonds. He did not say Kuwait planned to borrow
on the international market.
	   Kuwait took out its only international loan in 1991 to cover the
costs of reconstruction after Iraqi forces were driven from Kuwait.
	   It has since repaid the dlrs 5.5 billion it borrowed from
foreign private banks.
 &UR; ___
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ The state-run Jordan Industrial Development
Bank, one of Jordan's 10 largest financial institutions, has
extended 7.8 million dinars (dlrs 10.9 million) in soft loans to
finance 12 projects in Jordan.
	   A bank statement obtained on Sunday said the loan agreements
concluded in October will be spent on small and medium-sized
industrial and tourism projects throughout the country.
	   The statement said the projects will provide 520 new jobs and
generate an annual income of 4.5 million dinars (dlrs 6.3 million).
	   The bank receives loans and grants from the Jordanian government
as well as European and American donors. The money is used to
financed small and medium-size enterprises, which make up 97
percent of total businesses in Jordan.
	   The statement said the bank offered additional loans of 27
million dinars (dlrs 38 million) to finance 125 projects between
January and September this year.

Private Internet providers to get licenses in India
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari
Vajpayee announced Sunday that his government will soon surrender
its Internet monopoly, issuing licenses for private providers
beginning next week.
	   The long-awaited announcement was made at an information
technology conference in the southern city of Bangalore, India's
computer capital, United News of India reported. The news agency
said Vajpayee's words were greeted with cheers.
	   The government decided in September, 1997 to throw open Internet
to private service providers, but implementation has been stalled
by bureaucratic problems.
	   License agreements that were to have been signed between the
government and prospective private Internet service providers were
blocked in February by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India,
which said it had not been properly consulted in drawing up license
rules. New policy guidelines then had to be developed.
	   The state-owned Internet provider is capable of serving only a
limited number of users, and current subscribers complain its
service is overpriced and poor.

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Kenyan Sammy Korir retained his
Amsterdam marathon title Sunday in a time of 2 hours 8 minutes and
13 seconds, 11 seconds inside his winning time last year.
	   And Irishwoman Catherina McKiernan was the unchallenged winner
of the women's race, posting a time of 2:22.23 and chopping a
minute and 21 seconds off her personal best.
	   Korir shook off the final challenge from compatriot Simon Bor
with three kilometers left in the race as the pair ran through
Amsterdam's Vondelpark.
	   Bor finished second in 2:08.46, improving his personal best by
almost five minutes, ahead of Spaniard Alberto Juzdado, who came
home third in 2:09.59.
	   Korir's time was outside his personal best of 2:08.02 but
improved the course record he set last year of 2:08.24.
	   Much-fancied Spaniard Martin Fiz was forced to drop out of the
race.
	   Weather conditions were better than organizers had feared after
a week of almost constant rain, and it was dry at the start.
	   But rain during the race and gusting wind meant sponsors' prizes
of one million guilders (dlrs 500,000) waiting for world best times
in both the men's and women's races stayed safe.

classic and performance cars, finished the 490 kilometers from the
Turkish border to Syria in 8 hours, ending the 10th day of the race
near the Meridien Hotel in Damascus.
	   The drivers, after an evening's rest, will continue to Jordan
and work their way south to the finish line in Cape Town, South
Africa. They are expected to complete the race by Dec. 4.
	   The rally is organized by the International Automobile
Federation, and the Syrian Automobile Club will supervise the race
on its various stages in Syria.

After five years in power, Canada's folksy leader draws fire
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to restore feature slug &QL; 
 &UR; By DAVID CRARY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde don't share power in
Canada, but lately it seems that way.
	   Jean Chretien completes his fifth year as Canada's prime
minister this week riding as high as ever in public opinion polls.
	   Yet Chretien's carefully crafted image as a folksy ``little
guy'' now coexists with a different image. Adjectives like
``arrogant'' and ``intolerant'' have become commonplace in recent
weeks as influential media outlets join opposition politicians in
an unusually sustained offensive against the still-popular prime
minister.
	   Even supposed allies in Chretien's native Quebec _ those waging
a provincial election campaign against separatists _ are railing at
him, saying he should consider quitting because of comments about
Quebec's future that played into separatists' hands.
	   The criticism was encapsulated in a recent cover story titled
``For the Love of Power'' in Macleans magazine, which as Canada's
foremost news weekly tries to avoid partisanship.
	   The article said a growing number of critics ``believe the
self-styled little guy ... is actually a closet authoritarian,
ruthlessly intolerant of opinions other than his own.''
	   Last weekend, William Thorsell, editor-in-chief of the
nationally circulated newspaper The Globe and Mail, wrote a column
describing Chretien as perpetually angry.
	   ``Why does the prime minister react so aggressively and cruelly
to the most straightforward of human situations?'' Thorsell asked.
``He governs from the personal insecurity that dares not ask for
help or show magnanimity.''
	   One catalyst for the current criticism is an inquiry into
whether police used excessive force to suppress student protesters
a year ago when they demonstrated against Indonesia's former
President Suharto at a Pacific Rim summit hosted by Chretien. The
protesters contend police were obliging Chretien's desire to spare
Suharto embarrassment while in Vancouver.
	   Chretien, who denies intervening in police affairs, has bruised
some feelings by repeatedly joking about the pepper-spray used by
police against the protesters. His government rejected requests to
pay the students' legal bills, and he has discouraged any public
dissent on the matter from Parliament members of his Liberal Party.
	   His attitude prompted critics to recall past instances where
Chretien showed a thin-skinned side _ when he placed a chokehold on
a protester who crossed his path, and replied brusquely during a
nationally televised town hall meeting to a woman concerned about
unemployment.
	   Peter Donolo, the prime minister's communications director,
insists most Canadians are satisfied with Chretien despite
occasional flaps about his temperament.
	   ``In each of these cases, the opposition and the media are ready
to bury the prime minister,'' Donolo said in a telephone interview.
	   ``He's got everybody against him except the people on most of
these issues.''
	   Chretien, who turns 65 in January, grew up in a Quebec mill
town, the 18th of 19 children.
	   He has served in Parliament almost non-stop since 1963 and
became prime minister on Nov. 4, 1993. He was re-elected in June
1997 to a second term, and hasn't ruled out running for a third.
	   His Liberal Party seems unconquerable at the moment. The
parliamentary opposition is divided among four parties, none with
coast-to-coast strength and all below 20-percent support in
national polls.
	   Some critics say this lack of a political threat has been
unhealthy for Canada and Chretien's administration.
	   ``Chretien's Liberals have become so complacent they are no
longer bothering to conceal their arrogance,'' wrote columnist
Richard Gwyn in the Toronto Star.
	   Chretien's approval rating hovers around 60 percent, though some
opponents insist his public appeal will fade.
	   ``He's an old guy with old ideas,'' said Deborah Grey, deputy
leader of the right-wing Reform Party. ``This is the year people
will start to say, `We've got some concerns about this guy.'''
	   Chretien has never claimed his government is exciting. He boasts
of its lack of scandals and its economic achievements, notably
erasing Canada's budget deficit for the first time in three
decades.
	   Donolo attributes the furor over the anti-Suharto protest to
``scandal envy'' on the part of Canadian journalists who don't have
anything as racy as the Clinton-Lewinsky affair to cover.
	   ``It's not like we're making a hell of a lot of news, and we're
not giving them a lot of raw meat in terms of scandals,'' he said.
``It's pretty tame stuff.''
	   Donolo conceded there were frustrations among rank-and-file
Liberal legislators about limits on their influence in
policy-making. But overall, he said Chretien had given Canadians
what they expected.
	   ``People know Chretien so well at this point, they don't base
their judgment on what his latest uttering is,'' Donolo said.
``Sometimes they agree with him, sometimes they don't. But they
base their judgment on his history in public life and his
management of the country.

Russia seizes big alcohol shipment on Chinese border
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian customs officials seized more than 24
metric tons (26 tons) of alcohol being shipped illegally from China
to Russia, a news agency reported Sunday.
	   Four trucks were stopped Saturday at the Russian-Chinese border
near the village of Kamen-Rybolov in Russia's Far East, ITAR-Tass
said. One truck held the 24 metric tons (26 tons) of alcohol. The
report said the other trucks also contained alcohol and other
contraband.
	   One of the major priorities for the Russian government now is to
gain more control over the alcohol industry and crack down on
illegal alcohol sales, which cut deeply into state revenues.

P.W. Botha condemns South African truth report
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAT REBER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Apartheid's last hardline
president, P.W. Botha, charged that a landmark report on human
rights abuses in South Africa would stir up rather than calm racial
resentment, a newspaper said Sunday.
	   In an interview with the Johannesburg Afrikaans-language
newspaper Rapport, Botha spoke for the first time since the Truth
and Reconciliation report was released on Thursday by panel
chairman Archbishop Desmond Tutu.
	   The report has drawn fire from all political directions,
including the ruling African National Congress that took over after
1994's first democratic elections and the National Party that it
unseated.
	   Botha was singled out in the report for ordering violent acts,
including the 1987 bombing of the African National Congress' London
headquarters and the 1988 bombing of a Johannesburg building
housing an anti-apartheid group.
	   Earlier this year, Botha was convicted of contempt of court for
refusing to testify before the commission. Instead, he supplied
thousands of written pages of testimony to the panel.
	   ``The manner in which I ... am personally implicated in matters
in which neither I nor my government had any involvement indicates
that the truth and submissions by myself and others were completely
ignored,'' Botha was quoted as saying by Rapport.
	   The panel suggested that Botha and other key figures who have
not sought amnesty should be prosecuted for their alleged crimes of
killing and torture.
	   But the report also put some blame on the ANC for using
excessive force in its struggle, a finding that prompted the ruling
party to attempt blocking its release in court.
	   The attempt to muzzle the panel drew condemnation from the
international Human Rights Watch group in New York.
	   In a press release, the organization rejected the ANC's argument
``that it should be held to a lower standard of scrutiny because it
was fighting a just war against an oppressive system.''
	   Archbishop Tutu warned last week that the country must be
vigilant to protect democracy in the new South Africa.
	   ``There is no way in which you can assume that yesterday's
oppressed will not become tomorrow's oppressors,'' Tutu was quoted
as saying in the Sunday Times of Johannesburg.

	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ Irish police seized heroin and other
drugs worth an estimated 10 million Irish pounds (dlrs 15 million)
from three cars driven by British nationals in Dublin and at Dun
Laoghaire port, police said Sunday. Six people were arrested.
	   Members of the police drugs unit stopped two cars coming off the
ferry from Britain at Dun Laoghaire, 6 miles (10 km) south of the
capital, and found heroin worth 8 million pounds (dlrs 12 million).
They arrested two men and two women, all British nationals aged
between 30 and 32, police said.
	   Another car was stopped in Dublin city center and police found
heroin, cannabis and amphetamines worth 2-2.5 million pounds (dlrs
3-3.75 million). A 52-year-old man and 44-year-old woman _ both
British _ were arrested.
	   The six were being detained under an Irish drugs trafficking act
that permits them to be held without charge for as long as seven
days. No court appearance was immediately scheduled.

Town in southern Italy now lives off luck as well as tourism

<TEXT>
	   PESCHICI, Italy (AP) _ This tiny town clinging to the rocky
coast lives off tourism, and, starting Sunday, off a lot of luck,
dlrs 39.3 million worth of it.
	   Peschici won big in Saturday night's drawing of the Super
Enalotto game, which yielded a top prize after 11 straight winless
draws that had Italians all over the country feverishly trying to
guess the lucky six numbers as they sweated out waits in line to
buy game cards.
	   Ninety-nine shares of the winning series of numbers were sold in
this hamlet of a barely 4,000 souls, meaning, counting in-laws,
cousins and other members of the extended family system common in
small towns like this, a good chunk of Peschici woke up richer on
Sunday.
	   Coming in the underdeveloped south, where little stock is put in
decades-old promises by the state to create jobs and youth often
turn to organized crime for work, Peschici's clever pulling
together to try to beat long odds -- a one in 622 million shot at
guessing right -- was seen as proof honest enterprise can pay off.
	   ``This time fortune was not blind,'' said the anchorwoman on
private TV network Channel 5.
	   The owner of the town's sole newsstand, Domenico ``Mimi''
Lamargese, had devised a ``system,'' a combination of numbers that
hadn't come up for while, and sought takers in Peschici, a resort
on the mountainous, pine-forested ``spur'' of boot-shaped Italy.
	   After a sleepless night of fireworks and dancing in the main
square, on Sunday morning the town band -- men, women and children
decked out in crisply pressed, double-breasted blue blazers and
black hats -- paraded down the main street, playing tunes of joy
for the winners, who included the jobless, students, fishermen,
bricklayers, artisans and homemakers.
	   Each dlr-15 investment paid roughly dlrs 400,000, which could
buy a few nice, whitewashed houses here overlooking the Adriatic.
The entire ``system'' cost roughly dlrs 1,500, since the more
numbers you play, the more you pay.
	   ``This means the newsstand will become a national monument,''
joked Peschici mayor, Domenico Mazzone, trying to cheer up others,
who, like him, turned up their noses at Lamargese's system.
	   The bar near the newsstand, where the owner and his son each
won, offered free gelato, while the newsstand sold newspapers to
churchgoers after Mass and women checked out fresh catches of
octopus for Sunday lunch.
	   The town priest, Don Giuseppe, said he hoped the winners would
spare a million or so of lire (dlrs 625) for charity, and there was
talk of taking up a collection for a young girl who needed surgery.
	   For the record, the winning numbers were 1, 21, 30, 61, 73 and
84.

Modernizer premier gambles with confidence vote
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Will be led with opening remarks from debate at 1800 GMT &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Greece's parliament prepared to open
debate Sunday before holding a vote of confidence that Premier
Costas Simitis hopes will bolster his troubled Socialist
government.
	   Simitis requested the vote after carrying out a limited
reshuffle of his cabinet. The government is not considered in
danger of falling when the vote is taken by the 300-seat
parliament, where the Socialists have a comfortable majority.
	   But the debate will give conservative and leftist opposition
parties an opportunity to publicly hammer the government.
	   The roll-call vote is expected late Tuesday.
	   The Socialists were stung by shock defeats at municipal
elections earlier this month and are dogged by chronic dissent from
deputies opposed to Simitis' economic austerity.
	   Midway through his four-year term in office, the 62-year-old
Simitis is determined to press ahead effort to streamline the
public sector. And he has not to stray a ``millimeter'' from
economic policies designed to earn the European Union's poorest
country a place in the bloc's single currency group.
	   Greece is the only country of the 15-member EU which failed to
qualify for the first round of European Monetary Union. Britain,
Denmark and Sweden opted out of joining.
	   He needs at least 151 votes from the unicameral parliament to
survive. All 160 Socialist deputies and three expelled by the party
last year are predicted to support the government despite the
reservations of many. All opposition deputies will likely vote
against the motion.
	   Socialist dissenters have been warned they risk expulsion from
the party if they vote against the government.

Three boys missing as heavy rains swell rivers in western Germany
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Three boys last seen near rivers
swollen by days of heavy rain in western Germany were missing
Sunday and presumed drowned, officials said.
	   Some 400 people and six bloodhounds searched along the banks of
the Main River in Veitschoechheim, east of Frankfurt, for a
2-year-old boy last seen running with his dog toward the water on
Saturday.
	   The boy had been visiting an animal shelter with his father when
he ran off, police said. Only the dog returned.
	   The search, which also included several boats, was called off
Sunday as hopeless.
	   Officials in Lower Saxony state, meanwhile, were looking for two
5-year-old boys last seen Saturday afternoon playing in a backyard
bordering on the Ilse River near Wolfenbuettel.
	   About 350 people searched the wooded area, and a helicopter with
a heat-sensitive camera was also called in, but a fire department
spokesman said there was not much hope of finding the boys.
	   Heavy rains Sunday continued to push water levels up on the
major Rhine and Mosel rivers. Barge traffic was banned on long
stretches to avoid additional pressure on water-logged dams.
	   Some streets near the river in Cologne were under water, but
walls protecting the historic old town were holding the water back
there, and officials hoped a repeat of 1995's catastrophic flooding
could be avoided.
	   Still, officials advised residents in low-lying areas to begin
moving their valuables upstairs if possible as a precaution.
	   Upriver in Koblenz, some streets and cellars were flooded as the
Rhine climbed 7.2 meters (24 feet), but officials expressed hope it
would remain under the critical 9-meter (30-feet) mark.

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Greece's Nikos Pollias set a national
course record Sunday in winning the Athens Marathon in 2 hours, 18
minutes, 38 seconds over the ancient route that gives the event its
name.
	   Pollias led for most of the way from Marathon to central Athens.
Countrymen Vassilis Zambelis was second at 2:22:57 and Gerasimos
Kokotas finished third, 2:28:10.
	   The race concluded at the all-marble Pan Athenian stadium, site
of the first modern Olympic Games in 1896. The same route is
planned for the 2004 Olympics.
	   The course is said to closely follow the route taken by an
Athenian soldier in 490 B.C. from the plain of Marathon to the
Acropolis in Athens, where he collapsed and died after announcing
the victory of the Greeks against Persian invaders.
	   The annual Athens Marathon is dedicated to Grigoris Lambrakis,
the Greek pacifist murdered in 1963. Participation of non-Greek
athletes was low since this year's race coincided with the New York
Marathon.

U.N.: La Nina fueled by continuing drop in Pacific temperatures
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: EMBARGOED until 0001 GMT Monday, time set by source. &QL; 
 &UR; By GEIR MOULSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The surface of the Pacific Ocean is expected to
continue cooling slowly for the rest of the year, fueling the La
Nina weather phenomenon, the U.N. weather agency said Monday.
	   ``Weak La Nina conditions'' have started to develop, the World
Meteorological Organization said in its El Nino/La Nina Update. La
Nina, caused by a large pool of abnormally cool water in the
eastern Pacific, alternates with the warming El Nino.
	   By October, cooler than normal surface temperatures were in
evidence from the west coast of South America to well west of the
International dateline, WMO said.
	   The current La Nina started when surface temperatures in the
tropical Pacific dropped rapidly in May and June.
	   The shift brought heavy rainfall and flash floods to Indonesia
in August after a long drought caused by the El Nino phenomenon. It
has also brought rain to Australia.
	   An increased number of hurricanes over the Atlantic ``is
consistent with developing La Nina conditions,'' WMO said.
	   Last Sept. 24, four Atlantic hurricanes were active
simultaneously for the first time this century.
	   El Nino is created when trade winds weaken, allowing a large
mass of warm water in the western Pacific to pulse to the east
along the equator toward South America.
	   During El Nino, the warm water interacts with the atmosphere
above it, creating a worldwide disruption in weather patterns. The
1997-98 El Nino, the strongest ever recorded, meant record rain in
California, heavy flooding in Peru, drought in Indonesia and
tornadoes and flooding in Florida. El Nino is Spanish for ``little
boy.''
	   La Nina, Spanish for ``little girl,'' is just the opposite, with
the warm conditions of El Nino returning to the west. During La
Nina, which typically lasts at least a year, dry conditions take
hold of South America, Africa has alternate periods of drought and
flooding and rains return to Asia.
	   Because of its association with monsoon rains in south Asia,
``La Nina's impacts in that region are typically viewed as less
disruptive than those of El Nino,'' the WMO report said.
	   ``However, La Nina's relatively benign image may not be entirely
appropriate,'' it cautioned.
	   WMO added that uncertainty over surface temperatures in the
Atlantic and Indian Oceans, which contribute to changing rainfall
over Africa and South America, makes an accurate forecast
difficult.

AEK beats Ethnikos Asteras 3-1, round marred by incidents
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Demis Nikolaidis scored twice to give AEK
Athens a 3-1 victory over Ethnikos Asteras on Sunday in the 8th
round of the Greek first division soccer league.
	   But the round was marred by incidents in PAOK's game against
Olympiakos Piraeus in Salonica on Saturday.
	   Angry PAOK supporters entered the pitch and clashed with police
when the referee canceled a goal by the hosts eight minutes before
the end of the game. Olympiakos was leading 2-1.
	   Yiannis Papapetrou, who confirmed the goal at the beginning,
canceled it when his assistant, Tassos Vlachos, claimed that Mirko
Taccola netted the ball using his hand.
	   One hour later, Papapetrou called the match off when he was
informed that Nikos Fessopoulos, his second assistant, was hit in
the head and hospitalized with concussion.
	   Three policemen and eight civilians were also injured.
	   A final decision will be taken by the Association of Greek
Professional Soccer Teams, organizers of the league.
	   An announcement by PAOK Sunday asked that the three referees be
banned from first-division league play and for a repeat of the
game.
	   With its victory, AEK retained second place in the standings
with 20 points from eight games.
	   Panathinaikos, which beat crosstown Panionios 2-1 Saturday, is
atop the standings with 21 points.
	   Olympiakos and Xanthi share third place with 16 points each.
Olympiakos has one game in hand.
	   AEK attacked from the start, going ahead in the score with a
header by Paris Zoumboulis off a center from Giorgos Donis in the
3rd minute.
	   Stefanos Bassinas failed to level when his shot went just wide
in the 12th.
	   Seven minutes later, Zarko Dragas scored the equalizer with a
ground-hugging free-kick from the edge of the box.
	   Nikolaidis converted a penalty kick to give AEK a 2-1 lead in
the 39th and made the final 3-1 in the 48th.
	   On Saturday, Panathinaikos made a poor performance, but finally
beat Greek cup holder Panionios 2-1 thanks to a goal scored by
Nikos Lymberopoulos in the 90th.
	   Croatian star Aljosa Asanovic gave Panathinaikos the lead off a
pass from Brazilian striker Da Silva in the 13th.
	   Goalie Jozef Wandzik said no to the equalizer with a spectacular
save to a shot by Andonis Sapountzis in the 25th.
	   But the Polish goaltender could not do the same to a header by
Theofilos Karassavidis in the 36th.
	   The second half saw Panathinaikos pressing hard to score. But
the Panionios defense controlled all attacks until almost the end
of the game. Seconds before the final whistle, Lymberopoulos netted
the winner with a shot from three meters (yards) from Foto
Strakosha's goal mouth.
	   Playing before 27,000 spectators, 3,500 of whom traveled from
Piraeus to Salonica to support Olympiakos, the visitors took an
early lead with Ghanaian striker Peter Oforiquaye after a melee in
front of PAOK's goalmouth in the 6th minute.
	   Costas Frantzeskos came close to level in the 33th but
Olympiakos' goaltender Dimitris Eleftheropoulos denied it.
	   PAOK regrouped after the rest period, launching one attack after
the other. They managed to equalize with Frantzeskos in the 72nd.
	   But eight minutes later, Grigoris Giorgatos converted a penalty
to give Olympiakos a 2-1 lead.
	   PAOK protested the penalty claiming that Tassos Katsiambis never
fouled Olympiakos forward Sinisa Gogic in the area.

State to pay compensation owed by Basque separatists
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The Spanish state will pay the compensation
owed by members of the armed Basque separatist group ETA to their
victims, a leading newspaper reported Sunday.
	   Compensation due totals some 60 billion pesetas (dlrs 420
million) according to the Association of the Victims of Terrorism,
a group representing ETA's victims and their relatives, the
Madrid-based daily El Pais reported.
	   ETA has killed nearly 800 people in its 30-year campaign for an
independent state straddling northern Spain and southern France.
	   The group's members have tended to declare bankruptcy when
convicted of attacks and ordered to pay compensation to their
targets, El Pais said.
	   The government will study individually the cases where judges
have already set a sum as well as those that never reached court.
It will ask the parliament to approve an emergency loan to cover
the cost and explore ways to get the money back from ETA later, the
paper reported.
	   ``Moral and economic recognition of the victims is our only way
of helping to ease their pain,'' the daily quoted deputy Interior
Minister Leopoldo Calvo-Sotelo as saying.
	   According to El Pais, the government's promise to guarantee
compensation for ETA's victims is the flipside of parallel
preparations to soften policy towards separatist prisoners.
	   Resolution of the prisoner issue, one of the most contentious in
the Basque conflict, is considered key to advancing the fledgling
peace process that was ushered in by ETA's September announcement
of an open-ended cease-fire.
	   Current policy keeps the group's 535 prisoners dispersed
throughout the country _ in some cases hundreds of miles
(kilometers) from their families in the northern Basque region.
	   In another interview published Sunday's edition of the
Barcelona-based daily El Periodico, government spokesman Josep
Pique discounted a mass release of ETA prisoners.
	   But Pique also suggested that talks on the prisoner issue would
follow if ETA convinced the government that it intended to give up
violence for good.
	   A high level source in the government recently said ETA, whose
name stands for Basque Homeland and Liberty in the Basque language,
would not be required to give up its arms before talks could start
on the prisoners.

Mugabe in Congo for summit with Kabila, allies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ President Robert Mugabe flew to the
southeastern Congolese town of Lubumbashi on Sunday for a summit
with Congolese President Laurent Kabila and his southern African
military allies, officials said.
	   Mugabe was scheduled to meet with Kabila, President Eduardo dos
Santos of Angola and Namibia's President Sam Nujoma, and return to
Harare later Sunday.
	   The meeting was aimed at reviewing the allies' military options
against rebels fighting to topple Kabila, said a foreign ministry
official who declined to give his name.
	   The official Zimbabwe news agency reported Sunday the meeting
was called by Nujoma to discuss an allied offensive into the dense
jungles of eastern Congo where rebels have made rapid advances in
recent weeks.
	   Lubumbashi, Kabila's home town, is being used as a major base
for allied troops, including some of Zimbabwe's 6,000 troops in the
Congo, for advances northeastward.
	   The summit follows two days of talks in the Zambian capital,
Lusaka, last week that failed to hammer out a cease-fire after
Congolese rebels were excluded from that meeting.
	   The rebels' demands for face-to-face talks with Congolese
officials were rejected by Kabila's officials and their southern
African military allies.
	   Kabila has claimed Ugandan and Rwandan troops are fighting
alongside the rebels in Congo, but Rwandan officials have
persistently denied this.
	   Uganda has admitted its troops were in eastern Congo but says
its forces are there to attack Congo-based Ugandan rebels.
	   The Lusaka talks were the latest effort to end hostilities in
the three-month civil war in the vast central African country,
which has drawn in Namibia, Zimbabwe, Angola, Chad and reportedly
Sudan on the government's side.
	   Rwanda and Uganda favor the rebels.
	   The rebel forces, composed of ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted
members of Kabila's army and opposition politicians, accuse Kabila
of corruption, mismanagement and stirring up ethnic rivalries.
	   The same forces supported Kabila last year when he ousted
dictator Mobutu Sese Seko from Congo, formerly known as Zaire.
	   Police in the Zimbabwe capital of Harare on Saturday dispersed
protestors demonstrating against the country's military
intervention in Congo and heavy handed government policies.

Town in southern Italy now lives off luck as well as tourism

 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with newsstand owner having half a winning share;
other winners' comments &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PESCHICI, Italy (AP) _ This tiny town clinging to the rocky
coast lives off tourism, and, starting Sunday, off a lot of luck,
dlrs 39.3 million worth of it.
	   Peschici won big in Saturday night's drawing of the Super
Enalotto game, which yielded a top prize after 11 straight winless
draws that had Italians all over the country feverishly trying to
guess the lucky six numbers as they sweated out waits in line to
buy game cards.
	   Ninety-nine shares of the winning series of numbers were sold in
this hamlet of a barely 4,000 souls, meaning, counting in-laws,
cousins and other members of the extended family system common in
small towns like this, a good chunk of Peschici woke up richer on
Sunday.
	   Coming in the underdeveloped south, where little stock is put in
decades-old promises by the state to create jobs and youth often
turn to organized crime for work, Peschici's clever pulling
together to try to beat long odds -- a one in 622 million shot at
guessing right -- was seen as proof honest enterprise can pay off.
	   ``This time fortune was not blind,'' said the anchorwoman on
private TV network Channel 5.
	   The owner of the town's sole newsstand, Domenico ``Mimi''
Lamargese, had devised a ``system,'' a combination of numbers that
hadn't come up for while, and sought takers in Peschici, a resort
on the mountainous, pine-forested ``spur'' of boot-shaped Italy.
	   After a sleepless night of fireworks and dancing in the main
square, on Sunday morning the town band -- men, women and children
decked out in crisply pressed, double-breasted blue blazers and
black hats -- paraded down the main street, playing tunes of joy
for the winners, who included the jobless, students, fishermen,
bricklayers, artisans and homemakers.
	   Each dlr-15 investment paid roughly dlrs 400,000, which could
buy a few nice, whitewashed houses here overlooking the Adriatic.
The entire ``system'' cost roughly dlrs 1,500, since the more
numbers you play, the more you pay.
	   The newsstand owners said he bought a half a share for himself,
for about a dlrs 200,000 win. He said the win would let him finish
off car payments.
	   Said another winner, bricklayer Raffaele Ricci, who lives near
the newsstand: ``I haven't decided yet, I haven't thought of
anything yet,'' while the Italian news agency ANSA reported that
Peschici's tourist commissioner Matteo D'Amato planned to use his
winnings to fix up his hotel for tourists expected to come in 2000
to visit the nearby shrine town of San Giovanni Rotondo, associated
with Padre Pio, a popular monk the Vatican has on a possible road
to sainthood.

Juventus takes over Serie A leadership on 2-0 win
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PIERO VALSECCHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Capping a two-month pursuit, defending league
champion Juventus of Turin took over Italy's Serie A leadership
from Fiorentina on a 2-0 victory against Sampdoria in Sunday's
seventh round of games.
	   Two goals by Italian striker Filippo Inzaghi gave La Juve its
fourth home win in as many games and 16 points overall (5-1-1), one
point ahead of the Florentine team which suffered a 2-0 upset by
Parma on Saturday.
	   First division games were split over the weekend because of the
UEFA Cup commitments of some Italian teams.
	   It was an otherwise ``black Sunday'' for other potential title
contenders as Internazionale and Lazio were upset by underdog
opponents while AC Milan barely escaped defeat.
	   Inter was stunned 3-2 by Bari at San Siro stadium for its third
consecutive loss in league action.
	   Last-place Salernitana defeated Lazio 1-0.
	   AC Milan struggled to a 1-1 draw against low-ranked Piacenza, on
an injury-time goal by its Italian striker Maurizio Ganz.
	   Although missing its key midfielders Zinedine Zidane and Edgar
Davids _ both suspended _ Juventus commanded play at Turin's Delle
Alpi stadium and did not miss the chance to take advantage of
Fiorentina's second season loss.
	   Inzaghi kicked in the opening goal in the 33rd minute with a
right drive which sent the ball bouncing into Sampdoria's net after
hitting the post.
	   Inzaghi improved his season total to four goals making it 2-0 in
the 59th as he was left unmarked close to the net.
	   At Parma Fiorentina, which had led the Serie A standings since
the opening round, was sunk by two spectacular goals of young
Argentine striker Hernan Crespo.
	   Fiorentina's stellar forward line, led by Gabriel Batistuta and
Edmundo, was shut out by Parma defense, the league strongest with
only two goals allowed in seven games.
	   Inter players were jeered by about 60,000 angry fans as they
left the field following the humiliating home loss which dropped
the Milan team six points behind the league leader.
	   South African forward Phil Mazinga was the hero on Bari's side
as he tallied two second-half goals, which added to the one by
young Gianluca Zambrotta.
	   Brazilian superstar Ronaldo, fielded in the second half although
nursing a flu, led Inter's late rally attempt.
	   The Brazilian player earned and converted a penalty with four
minutes left and fed defender Francesco Colonnese for Inter's
second goal in injury time.
	   Ronaldo, showing flashy samples of his class and speed despite a
questionable form, barely missed the equalizer in the 93rd. With
two goals in two games, he was the only Inter player to draw some
applause from an otherwise hostile crowd.
	   Inter was one player down for 50 minutes following the expulsion
of its Portuguese midfielder Paulo Sosa.
	   Salernitana, a Serie A newcomer, captured its first season
victory against mighty Lazio on a late goal by striker Marco Di
Vaio, a former Lazio player.
	   Di Vaio's goal ended Lazio's unbeaten six-game streak.
	   The Roman team, which could not field its injured strikers
Marcelo Salas and Christian Vieri, was left with 10 points (2-4-1),
in a tie with Inter.
	   At Piacenza Simone Inzaghi, the younger brother of the Juventus
striker, gave Piacenza a 1-0 first-half lead.
	   Ganz kicked in Milan's equalizer in the 92nd minute, after
hitting the bar a few minutes earlier.
	   Milan (4-1-2) was tied in third place, at 13 points, with AS
Roma which trounced Udinese 4-0 in one of the three games played on
Saturday.
	   In matches between low-ranked teams Empoli downed Perugia 2-0,
Vicenza defeated Cagliari 2-1 and Bologna breezed past Venezia 2-0.
	   Both Vicenza goals were tallied by Uruguayan forward Marcelo
Otero.

Qatari court sentences six for bombing plot, acquits one
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DOHA, Qatar (AP) _ A Qatari court on Sunday sentenced five men
to 10 years in prison and another to three years for plotting to
blow up a government building in 1996 as part of a coup attempt.
	   The three-judge court issued the sentences at the same time it
handed down guilty verdicts against the six and acquitted a seventh
defendant.
	   Six of the seven defendants are Qataris. An Omani, who was
sentenced to 10 years, was tried in absentia.
	   They have two weeks to appeal the verdict. The trial started in
early this year.
	   Defendant Fawaz al-Muhanaddy is also being tried in a related
case. He is part of a group of 110 people accused of staging a
failed coup in 1996 against Qatar's ruler, Sheik Hamad bin Khalifa
Al Thani.
	   Sheik Hamad ousted his father, Sheik Khalifa bin Hamad Al Thani,
in a bloodless coup in 1995. The government has suggested Sheik
Khalifa, 65, was behind the 1996 coup attempt.

Settlers clear ground for Jewish neighborhood in east Jerusalem

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Without any government interference, Jewish
settlers Sunday erected a barbed-wire fence around a dusty hilltop
they see as the future site of a 132-unit Jewish settlement in a
Palestinian area of Jerusalem captured in the 1967 Mideast war.
	   Palestinian officials expressed outrage, calling the building a
violation of the latest Israeli-Palestinian peace accord which
include a halt of unilateral actions.
	   Construction at the Ras al Amoud neighborhood in traditionally
Arab east Jerusalem has been held up for a year by the government,
worried that the project could lead to violence among Jews and
Palestinians.
	   Last year clashes broke out when a group of settlers moved in to
an existing home in the area.
	   David Bar-Illan, a senior adviser to Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu said the premier felt Sunday's building was harmless.
	   ``Because all they wanted to do was build a fence around private
property, (Netanyahu) decided there was no such threat and decided
not to intervene in this matter,'' Bar-Illan told CNN. Bar-Illan
said the latest peace deal did not mention Jerusalem.
	   But Faisal Husseini, a former minister in Yasser Arafat's
Palestinian Cabinet and the senior PLO official in Jerusalem,
called the construction illegal.
	   ``What the settlers are doing here is against the peace
agreement, which prohibits unilateral actions that change the
status quo,'' Husseini said. He urged Netanyahu to halt the
project.
	   Israel captured east Jerusalem from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast
war and encouraged Jews to move to the area. The Palestinians want
the area to become the capital of a future independent state.
	   Long before sunrise, settlers erected a fence around the
property owned by Miami millionaire Irving Moskowitz and a tractor
cleared away stones and rubble in preparation for construction.
	   ``This neighborhood has been Jewish for 100 years,'' said Motti
Dan, a leader of the Ateret Cohanim settler group. ``We are
building on private property,'' he said.
	   About 15 activists from the Israeli group Peace Now demonstrated
at the site Sunday. Four protesters including three who chained
themselves to a tractor were arrested.

Dalai Lama appeals for support for Tibetan autonomy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SCHNEVERDINGEN, Germany (AP) _ The Dalai Lama, spiritual leader
of Tibetan Buddhism, ended a weeklong stay in Germany on Sunday by
asking for international support for his campaign to win autonomy
for his homeland from China.
	   The Nobel Peace Prize laureate said China was beginning to open
up to new ideas, but stressed that more freedom of expression was
key to an improvement of Tibet's situation.
	   ``There are many unnecessary problems that result from
uncertainty'' and a lack of understanding among Chinese leaders
about the situation in Tibet, he said.
	   He declined to elaborate, though, saying it might make opening a
hoped-for dialogue with Beijing more difficult.
	   ``It's advisable now not to say too much in public,'' he said.
	   The Dalai Lama has lived in exile in India since China
suppressed a Tibetan independence movement in 1959.
	   He was in Germany to teach a weeklong seminar for about 9,000
students in Buddhism, personal growth and spiritual expansion. The
sessions were held in an old military training barracks in
Schneverdingen, about 50 kilometers (30 miles) outside the northern
city of Hamburg.
	   The Dalai Lama said he noticed a serious interest in Buddhism in
Germany, while adding that all religions are valuable and necessary
for more humanity in society.

South Africa beats West Indies for Wills Cup
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with South Africa winning. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Playing its first cricket tournament in
muggy Dhaka, South Africa easily chased down the West Indies to win
the Wills International Cup Sunday.
	   South Africa finished at 248 for six in 47 overs, led by captain
Hansie Cronje's 61 and his astute leadership.
	   South Africa won the toss and elected to field, from where it
held the West Indies to 245 in 49.3.
	   The Windies were led by the powerful Phillo Wallace with 103.
Wallace's score included five sixes and 11 fours.
	   South Africa's Jacques Kallis, the man of the match,
kick-started the Windies' collapse. His haul of five for 30
included the dismissal of Carl Hooper, who scored 49. South African
skipper Hansie Cronje was three for 44.
	   The Windies' biggest blow came when captain Brian Lara was
bowled around his legs by off-spinner Derek Crookes. Lara left with
an 11 that included a brilliant six.
	   Though Bangladesh was the host, its team was not among the nine
taking part in the tournament because it does not have Test status.
The tournament gave sports-crazy Bangladeshis a rare chance to see
the best of cricket at home.
	   ``We really enjoyed playing here,'' South African captain Hansie
Cronje told a cheering crowd after Sunday's final. ``It's the first
time we've come here as the South African team, and we hope to get
an invitation back.''
	   The West Indies had easily beat India by six wickets Saturday to
set up the final with South Africa. South Africa beat world
champions Sri Lanka in its semifinal on Friday. The other
competitors were Zimbabwe, New Zealand, Australia, England, and
Pakistan.
	   The International Cricket Council knockout tournament was the
only multi-sided meet before the World Cup in England next year.
	   Because a clear winner was needed in every game, organizers had
planned that in case of a tie, five bowlers from each side would
bowl to break the bails without any batsmen or fielders. Bowling
was to have continued until the fate of the match was decided. The
unusual tie-breaker, known as a bowl-out, never made it debut in
Dhaka.

	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ A farmer diagnosed with Congo
fever is being treated at the Garden City Clinic, the hospital said
Sunday.
	   The clinic said the disease, one of the viral hemorrhagic
fevers, was endemic to South Africa and treated regularly in
hospitals through strict isolation.
	   The patient, Wikus van Niekerk, 25, is believed to have
contracted the disease through a tick bite while on holiday at a
game farm in Northern Province. He was admitted to the hospital on
Friday with a high fever and internal bleeding.
	   The clinic said the disease was less severe and contagious than
other hemorrhagic fevers such as Ebola.

Netanyahu hecklers arrested at Rabin memorial
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Several Israelis were arrested Sunday for
heckling Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at a memorial ceremony
for Yitzhak Rabin, assassinated three years ago.
	   As Netanyahu laid a wreath on Rabin's grave at Jerusalem's Mt.
Herzl cemetery, one demonstrator shouted, ``You incited to
murder.'' Others called out ``murderer, murderer,''
	   None of the unarmed hecklers approached Netanyahu, who is
guarded by several armed secret servicemen and many police officers
wherever he goes. Police spokeswoman Linda Menuhin said five people
were arrested at the ceremony for incitement.
	   Netanyahu, leader of the opposition when Rabin was prime
minister, has been blamed by both Rabin's family and members of the
left-wing Labor party for contributing to the violent political
atmosphere leading up to the assassination.
	   On November 4, 1995, Rabin was shot and killed as he left a
peace rally in Tel Aviv by a Jewish ultranationalist bent on
stopping Rabin's land-for-peace policies with the Palestinians.
	   In a speech to Israel's Knesset, Netanyahu tried to shake off
the blame. ``There is no place and no justification to accuse an
entire public for the guilt of a sole person,'' he said. Netanyahu
said that while he disagreed with Rabin's policies, he aimed to
achieve a peace which would unify Israelis.
	   Sunday, Netanyahu and other Israeli leaders marked the third
anniversary of the killing according to the Jewish calendar with a
somber ceremony at Rabin's graveside.
	   Israel's Cabinet opened its weekly meeting with a minute of
silence in memory of Rabin and Israel's parliament held a special
session in memory of the former Israeli premier, defense minister
and war hero.
	   Saturday in Tel Aviv, some 300,000 Israelis jammed the square
where Rabin was killed and stood shoulder-to-shoulder on streets
for blocks in all directions, to pay tribute to Rabin and voice
support for the continuation of the Israeli-Palestinian peace
process he began.
	   Sunday, hundreds of people stopped by a permanent memorial at
the square now named for Rabin to light candles and write messages
of peace at the site.
	   Israeli flags were lowered to half-staff on government buildings
and at army bases.
	   At many Israeli schools, students gathered for memorial
ceremonies and discussions about the meaning of the assassination
to Israel's future. Radio and television channels broadcast
documentaries and discussions about Rabin's life and his violent
death.
	   Israel's government decreed an annual memorial day for the only
Israeli leader to be assassinated, but did not declare it a work or
government holiday.
	   President Ezer Weizman lit a memorial candle at his official
residence, beginning the day of remembrance. Representatives of
many segments of Israeli society attended the smaller ceremony,
where Weizman warned that the lessons of Rabin's assassination had
not been learned.
	   ``Could it happen again?'' asked the Israeli president, a
retired Air Force commander and veteran peace activist now in a
largely ceremonial role. He answered his own question, warning, ``I
regret to say that lately there are signs that the answer is not
necessarily a no.''
	   After Netanyahu signed a recent peace agreement with Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat, in which Israel will turn over another 13.1
percent of the West Bank to the Palestinians, there have been
violent demonstrations against the government, recalling some of
the protests before Rabin was killed.

Monty finishes top again as Clarke wins final event

<TEXT>
	   JEREZ, Spain (AP) _ Colin Montgomerie finished top of the
European PGA Tour money list for an unprecedented sixth year in a
row Sunday after a third place finish at the Volvo Masters, which
was won by Northern Ireland's Darren Clarke.
	   Starting the final round one stroke behind his main rival and
joint tournament leader Lee Westwood, Montgomerie carded a 4-under
68 at the Montecastillo course for a 14-under total of 274.
	   It was all over for Westwood when he twice drove out of bounds
from the tee at the 172-yard 14th and made a quadruple bogey seven.
He finished with a 75 for a four-round total of 280.
	   Clarke, the only other player capable of overtaking Montgomerie
and Westwood on the money list, made a 9-under 63 in the final
round for a 17-under total of 271. He took home the first prize of
166,000 pounds (dlrs 277,220) and wound up second in the overall
money list behind Monty.
	   Scotland's Andrew Coltart finished runner up in the tournament
after a 66 left him two strokes behind, squandering his chance by
three-putting the third and missing a birdie chance at the last.
	   Montgomerie went into the tournament leading the European Tour
money list with winnings of 760,077 (dlrs 1,276,929). Westwood was
No. 2 at 714,812 (dlrs 1,200,884) followed by Clarke at 616,867
(dlrs 1,036,337).
	   To finish top, Clarke had to win the championship and hope that
Montgomerie finished ninth or lower with Westwood not in the top
three.
	   By finishing top yet again, Montgomerie also collected 170,000
pounds (dlrs 284,000) from the bonus pool, taking his total for the
year to 993,077 pounds (dlrs 1.66 million).

Juventus takes over Serie A leadership on 2-0 win
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PIERO VALSECCHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Capping a two-month pursuit, defending league
champion Juventus of Turin took over Italy's Serie A leadership
from Fiorentina on a 2-0 victory against Sampdoria in Sunday's
seventh round of games.
	   Two goals by Italian striker Filippo Inzaghi gave La Juve its
fourth home win in as many games and 16 points overall (5-1-1), one
point ahead of the Florentine team, which suffered a 2-0 upset by
Parma on Saturday.
	   First division games were split over the weekend because of the
UEFA Cup commitments of some Italian teams.
	   It was an otherwise Black Sunday for other potential title
contenders as Internazionale and Lazio were upset by underdog
opponents while AC Milan barely escaped defeat.
	   Inter was stunned 3-2 by Bari at San Siro stadium for its third
consecutive loss in league action.
	   Last-place Salernitana defeated Lazio 1-0.
	   AC Milan struggled to a 1-1 draw against low-ranked Piacenza, on
an injury-time goal by its Italian striker Maurizio Ganz.
	   Although missing its key midfielders Zinedine Zidane and Edgar
Davids _ both suspended _ Juventus commanded play at Turin's Delle
Alpi stadium and did not miss the chance of taking advantage of
Fiorentina's second season loss.
	   Inzaghi kicked in the opening goal in the 33rd minute with a
right drive which sent the ball bouncing into Sampdoria's net after
hitting the post.
	   Inzaghi improved his season total to four goals making it 2-0 in
the 59th as he was left unmarked close to the net.
	   At Parma Fiorentina, which had led the Serie A standings since
the opening round, was sunk by two spectacular goals by young
Argentine striker Hernan Crespo.
	   Fiorentina's stellar forward line, led by Gabriel Batistuta and
Edmundo, was shut out by Parma's defense, the strongest league with
only two goals allowed in seven games.
	   Inter players were jeered by about 60,000 angry fans as they
left the field following the humiliating home loss, which dropped
the Milan team six points behind the league leader.
	   South African forward Phil Mazinga was the hero on Bari's side
as he tallied two second-half goals, which added to the one by
young Gianluca Zambrotta.
	   Brazilian superstar Ronaldo, fielded in the second half though
nursing the flu, led Inter's late rally attempt.
	   The Brazilian player earned and converted a penalty with four
minutes left and fed defender Francesco Colonnese for Inter's
second goal in injury time.
	   Ronaldo, showing flashy samples of his class and speed despite
questionable form, barely missed the equalizer in the 93rd. With
two goals in two games, he was the only Inter player to draw some
applause from an otherwise hostile crowd.
	   Inter was one player down for 50 minutes following the expulsion
of its Portuguese midfielder, Paulo Sosa.
	   Salernitana, a Serie A newcomer, captured its first season
victory against mighty Lazio on a late goal by striker Marco Di
Vaio, a former Lazio player.
	   Di Vaio's goal ended Lazio's unbeaten six-game streak.
	   The Roman team, which could not field injured strikers Marcelo
Salas and Christian Vieri, was left with 10 points (2-4-1), in a
tie with Inter.
	   At Piacenza, Simone Inzaghi, the younger brother of the Juventus
striker, gave Piacenza a 1-0 first-half lead.
	   Ganz kicked in Milan's equalizer in the 92nd minute after
hitting the bar a few minutes earlier.
	   Milan (4-1-2) was tied in third place, at 13 points, with AS
Roma which trounced Udinese 4-0 in one of the three games played on
Saturday.
	   In matches between low-ranked teams, Empoli downed Perugia 2-0,
Vicenza defeated Cagliari 2-1 and Bologna breezed past Venezia 2-0.
	   Both Vicenza goals were tallied by Uruguayan forward Marcelo
Otero.

Krajicek captured Eurocard Open in straight sets over Kafelnikov
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STUTTGART, Germany (AP) _ Richard Krajicek served with
overwhelming power and accuracy to beat Yevgeny Kafelnikov 6-4,
6-3, 6-3 and capture the Eurocard Open for the second time in his
career Sunday.
	   The victory brought Krajicek closer to clinching one of the two
last spots still available in the eight-man, season-ending World
Championship in Hanover, Germany.
	   He is now in the eighth position, but there are still three
weeks of tennis before the championship and Krajicek said he may
decide to have knee surgery that would prevent him from playing
there.
	   Krajicek, who had ousted fifth-ranked Andre Agassi and No. 1
Pete Sampras en route to the final, was devastating against
Kafelnikov.
	   ``My serve was very important,'' Krajicek said. ``I returned
well also, you can't win only with serve.''
	   ``The way I mixed it up was the most important thing about my
victory,'' he said.
	   The 26-year-old Dutchman never faced a break point on his serve
and did not give up a single point in his first four service games.
He took the first set with an ace on his second set point and
finished with 21 aces.
	   In the second, Kafelnikov saved two set points but then hit a
forehand long to fall into a two-set deficit.
	   The Russian, No. 10 in the world, dropped his serve again to
give Krajicek a 2-0 lead and he breezed through the final set,
hitting a backhand volley to break Kafelnikov's serve for the
match.
	   The Dutchman dropped only 14 points in 14 service games.
	   ``He played unbelievably, extremely well,'' said Kafelnikov
said, the 1996 French Open winner. ``He covered the net very well.
I tried everything but nothing worked all. He dominated me and that
was the bottom line.''
	   Krajicek, the 1996 Wimbledon champion, entered the tournament
ranked 11th, but his second title of the year is likely to push him
into the top 10 when the new computer rankings come out Monday.
	   Kafelnikov, 24, was playing in his fifth final this year. He has
won two of them.
	   Krajicek's last title was in February this year in St.
Petersburg.
	   He won the title here in 1995 and played in his second
consecutive final in the start-studded dlrs 2.45 million
tournament. The victory earned Krajicek dlrs 376,000, while
Kafelnikov picked up dlrs 198,000.
	   ``This week Richard played outstanding tennis and and deserved
to win the tournament,'' Kafelnikov said. He is now 3-4 against
Krajicek, having lost the last three matches.
	   Krajicek now must decide when to have surgery to remove damaged
cartilage from his left knee. If it's after Hanover, Krajicek said
he would not recover in time to play the Australian Open in
January.
	   ``It's whether you miss a Grand Slam or an event that you have
to qualify for throughout the year,'' Krajicek said.

U.S. official says fear still hindering return of Kosovo refugees
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Fear of Serb police and Yugoslav
soldiers continues to prevent ethnic Albanian refugees from
returning home, although conditions have approved under the Kosovo
peace deal, a senior U.S. official said Sunday.
	   After visiting two villages in western Kosovo, U.S. Assistant
Secretary of State Julia Taft said conditions in the war-torn
province were much better than during her previous visit two months
ago.
	   While many of the 50,000 or more refugees who had been living in
the woods have returned to villages, some still were staying away,
she said.
	   ``It's difficult to say that everybody is able to go back home
or is willing to go back home,'' Taft said. ``There is fear among
the population.''
	   Taft meet with ethnic Albanian refugees during a visit to a
compound in the foothills south of Pec, 100 kilometers (60 miles)
west of Pristina.
	   The refugees complained that Serb police harassment has
continued despite the Oct. 12 agreement between Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic and U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke to halt a
seven-month crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo.
	   Hundreds of people have died in fighting that sent an estimated
300,000 people fleeing the troubled southern Serbian province,
where ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs 9 to 1. Serbia is the
dominant republic in Yugoslavia.
	   The refugees said only international troops, not the unarmed
foreign verification force being created, could solve their
problem.
	   ``The Westerners are not going to solve the problem,'' Taft told
one refugee family. ``The people who live here must come to an
agreement to solve their problem.''
	   But the head of the family, who asked that his name not be used
because he feared retribution by Serb police, told her: ``I don't
think that it will be possible.''
	   Western powers threatened NATO airstrikes to force Milosevic to
reach the Oct. 12 agreement that calls for him to withdraw police
and military forces to levels before the February crackdown.
	   The agreement also provides for full access for relief agencies
and a 2,000-member unarmed ``ground verification mission'' that
will verify compliance with the deal.
	   Yugoslavia's defense minister said he expects no trouble with
the coming international peace mission, but he warned against
possible provocations by ethnic Albanians.
	   Pavle Bulatovic, in an interview to Belgrade-based BK television
late Saturday, said the Yugoslav army will cooperate fully with the
Milosevic-Holbrooke agreement.
	   ``The presence of verifiers ... and overflights by NATO planes
will not be in conflict with Yugoslav Army performing its regular
duties,'' like guarding the country's borders, Bulatovic said.

Senegal denies Guinea-Bissau boat permission to dock
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Senegalese authorities were refusing
docking permission to a boat carrying more than 160 people from
neighboring Guinea-Bissau, news reports said Sunday.
	   The Portuguese-owned boat neared Senegal's capital Dakar on
Friday, after traveling up the West African coast from the battered
capital of Guinea-Bissau where a five-month-old civil war recently
reignited, the Portuguese news agency Lusa said.
	   The owner of the boat said he didn't know why permission to dock
was refused, although he admitted the vessel was not licensed to
travel outside of Guinea-Bissau, Lusa reported.
	   Carlos Lobo told the agency that Guinea-Bissau's Prime Minister
Carlos Correia was in Dakar to clarify the situation.
	   Lobo said that his passengers were not refugees as they wanted
to travel on to Portugal or Brazil rather than stay in Senegal, the
agency reported.
	   Lobo also complained that medical assistance requested for
ailing passenger Amelia Vieira was so long in coming that she died.
	   ``We asked Dakar's port for help after the woman fainted at 4:00
a.m. (0400GMT), but the doctor only came on board at 11 a.m.
(1100GMT) and she was already dead,'' Lobo told Lusa.
	   Vieira's body was evacuated from the ``Bjan Bjan'' into Dakar,
along with four other women who were taken to hospital after
fainting presumably from weakness, Lobo said.
	   Fighting in Guinea-Bissau has displaced almost half its
impoverished population of 1 million.
	   The conflict in the former Portuguese colony started June 7,
when rebels led by former army chief Brig. Ansumane Mane seized the
capital's army garrison and airport.
	   Senegal and the Republic of Guinea immediately sent in some
3,000 troops to back President Joao Bernardo Vieira.
	   A July 26 cease-fire was broken two weeks ago, when rebels and
loyalist troops resumed fighting in the capital.

Kosovo guerrillas sent two reporters to 60 days in prison
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Kosovo Albanian separatists said
Sunday their self-styled ``military court'' sentenced two Serbian
journalists abducted two weeks ago to 60 days imprisonment.
	   In a statement to Albanian-language papers, the Kosovo
Liberation Army said its self-styled ``military court'' sentenced
Nebojsa Radosevic, 32 and Vladimir Dobricic, 50, to prison for
``violation and disregard of rules on civilian and military
organization'' set by the KLA.
	   It did not specify what constituted the alleged violation.
	   Radosevic and Dobricic, both working for Yugoslavia's official
Tanjug news agency, went missing Oct. 18 while on assignment in the
war-torn province. The KLA later confirmed it abducted the
journalists from their car after they apparently took a wrong turn
and strayed into rebel-held territory.
	   The KLA statement said the reporters were immediately sent to a
``prison number 7'' without saying where that was. It also said
they had the right to appeal the verdict but it was not clear to
whom or how.
	   Despite strong demands by Red Cross and other international
organizations for urgent release of Dobricic and Radosevic, the KLA
has rejected freeing them or allowing visits by international
representatives.

<TEXT>
	   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) _ Rescue workers and air force
helicopters set out Sunday for a town in northern Nicaragua that
was hit by massive mudslides, killing at least 58 and pushing the
death toll of former hurricane Mitch nearly 500.
	   More than 2,400 people living in the 10 communities at the foot
of the Casitas Volcano were still unaccounted for, Mayor Felicita
Zeledon of Posoltega told the government's Radio Nicaragua. She
said 58 bodies had been pulled from the mud in her town, about 50
miles northwest of Managua.
	   ``It is like a desert littered with buried bodies,'' Zeledon
said, citing reports from rescue workers.
	   Few other details were immediately available. With highways cut
by flooding and poor visibility, authorities had to abandon efforts
Saturday to reach the town of 14,000 near the Honduran border.
	   Air force helicopters lifted off from Managua's Sandino airport
early Sunday, and a Red Cross team set out by land from Chinandega,
about 18 miles to the northwest, for Posoltega.
	   Zeledon's statements were the first official confirmation of any
deaths from mudslides in the northwestern province of Chinandega,
where radio reports said as many as 4,000 people may have been
killed.
	   In addition to the 58 killed in mudslides, Nicaragua has
reported 131 dead from heavy rain and flash flooding. Another 253
people were listed as missing, the National Civil Defense reported.
	   Nicaragua has asked the United States to lend it several large
helicopters to help deliver aid and assess casualties and damage,
Defense Minister Pedro J. Chamorro Barrios said Saturday.
	   In Honduras, at least 231 people had been confirmed dead from
Mitch, the National Emergency Commission said Saturday.
	   El Salvador _ where 63 people died and 200 were missing in flash
floods _ declared a state of emergency Saturday, as did Guatemala,
where nine people died when floodwaters swept away their homes.
Mexico reported one death from Mitch on Monday.
	   By Sunday, Mitch's winds _ once near 180 mph (290 kph) _ had
dropped to 27 mph (43 kph) and the storm was located near
Quezaltenango, Guatemala, moving west at 7 mph (11 kph), the U.S.
National Hurricane Center reported.
	   One hundred and thirty-one people were reported killed in
Tegucigalpa after floodwaters rose to the third floor of some
buildings in the Honduran capital Saturday.
	   In the Caribbean, the U.S. Coast Guard widened a search for a
tourist schooner with 31 people aboard that hasn't been heard from
since Tuesday. Four Coast Guard C-131 planes swept much of the
western Caribbean, so far without luck.
	   States of emergency remained in effect in Honduras and
Nicaragua, but the rains finally stopped.
	   With rainfall of 4 inches (10 centimeters) an hour at the height
of the storm, downed bridges, rampant rivers, toppled trees and
mudslides isolated hundreds of communities where food, water and
medicine were in short supply.
	   In Tegucigalpa, the capital's airport was closed and more than
30,000 people had been evacuated. An equal number had already been
taken to shelters in the nation's second city, San Pedro Sula in
the north.
	   France said it will send 23 disaster relief specialists and aid
to the Central American countries hit by Mitch, and the British
Royal Navy ordered a West Indies-based frigate to the area to help
aid victims.

South Africa beats West Indies for Wills Cup

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Playing its first cricket tournament in
muggy Dhaka, South Africa easily chased down the West Indies to win
the inaugural Wills International Cup Sunday.
	   South Africa finished at 248 for six in 47 overs, fueled by
captain Hansie Cronje's 61 and his astute leadership. South Africa
had won the toss and elected first to field, from where it held the
West Indies to 245 in 49.3.
	   The tournament win meant a dlrs 100,000 check for South Africa,
and dlrs 60,000 for runner-up West Indies.
	   The Windies were led by the powerful Phillo Wallace with 103, a
score that included five sixes and 11 fours.
	   South Africa's Jacques Kallis, the man of the match,
kick-started the Windies' collapse. His haul of five for 30
included the dismissal of Carl Hooper, who scored 49. South African
skipper Cronje was three for 44.
	   The Windies' biggest blow came when captain Brian Lara was
bowled around his legs by off-spinner Derek Crookes. Lara left with
an 11 that included a brilliant six.
	   South Africa and the West Indies fly out of Dhaka Monday to play
a test and a one-day series in South Africa.
	   Though Bangladesh was the host, its team was not among the nine
taking part in the tournament because it does not have Test status.
The tournament gave sports-crazy Bangladeshis a rare chance to see
the best of cricket at home.
	   ``We really enjoyed playing here,'' South African captain Hansie
Cronje told a cheering crowd after Sunday's final. ``It's the first
time we've come here as the South African team, and we hope to get
an invitation back.''
	   The West Indies had easily beat India by six wickets Saturday to
set up the final with South Africa. South Africa beat world
champions Sri Lanka in its semifinal on Friday. The other
competitors were Zimbabwe, New Zealand, Australia, England, and
Pakistan.
	   The International Cricket Council knockout tournament was the
only multi-sided meet before the World Cup in England next year.
	   Because a clear winner was needed in every game, organizers had
planned that in case of a tie, five bowlers from each side would
bowl to break the bails without any batsmen or fielders. Bowling
was to have continued until the fate of the match was decided. The
unusual tie-breaker, known as a bowl-out, never made its debut in
Dhaka.

U.N., world leaders prepare for new showdown with Iraq
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Aziz, Butler quotes
 &UR; By EILEEN ALT POWELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ A defiant Iraq said Sunday it would not
back down from its decision to ban U.N. weapons inspectors from
working in the country, even if military action were threatened.
	   Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan said in a speech opening a
trade fair here that ``there will be no cooperation (with the
inspectors) before Iraq's demands are met'' and that the country
would maintain this stance ``until the sanctions are lifted.''
	   His comments came the morning after the U.N. Security Council
issued a statement condemning Iraq's decision Saturday to cut off
all dealings with arms inspectors as ``a flagrant violation'' of
U.N. resolutions.
	   The council also repeated its offer to review Iraq's compliance
with U.N. resolutions if it resumes cooperation with weapons
inspectors of the U.N. Special Commission.
	   Asked about the possibility of military action to force Iraq to
cooperate, Ramadan said: ``Iraq does not fear the threat of the
United States because it has been threatening Iraq for the past
eight years.''
	   In an interview with the Cable News Network, Deputy Prime
Minister Tariq Aziz later dismissed the Special Commission as a ``a
subsidiary organ of the Mossad (the Israeli spy agency) and the
CIA.''
	   ``Why should we go on working with UNSCOM?'' Aziz asked.
``Working with UNSCOM is bitter and it's too expensive. If you are
ready to tolerate bitterness and hardship... you expect the
sanctions should be lifted.''
	   Aziz said Iraq was only prepared to reverse its policies if the
Security Council moved toward lifting the sanctions. However, he
said Iraq would not order the inspectors to leave.
	   ``If they want to stay it is up to them,'' Aziz said. ``We have
not asked them to leave our country.''
	   At the United Nations, chief weapons inspector Richard Butler
also told CNN he had ``no intention'' of withdrawing his teams from
Iraq.
	   Iraq's decision halts all activities of the U.N. Special
Commission _ which is charged with eliminating Iraq's chemical and
biological weapons as well as long-range missiles _ in Iraq.
	   In effect, that means stopping U.N. monitors from visiting
already inspected weapons sites, which was allowed to continue when
Iraq stopped inspections of new suspected arms-making sites in
August.
	   The Iraqi decision exempted monitoring by the
Vienna-headquartered International Atomic Energy Agency, which is
charged with eliminating nuclear weapons.

Reports: signs point to arson in Swedish fire that killed 60

<TEXT>
	   GOTEBORG, Sweden (AP) _ Officials offered no word Sunday on what
might have caused the dance-hall fire that killed 60 young people,
but reports of grim possibilities abounded in newspapers.
	   And while the officials were telling journalists that they had
no answer to the technical question of why the fire happened,
thousands of Goteborg's residents came to the fire site to lay
flowers, light candles and grapple with the philosophical ''why?''
that plagues anyone gripped by tragedy.
	   ''Why wasn't I there?'' sobbed a young woman as she turned away
from the 200-meter-long (600-foot-long) mound of bouquets and
flickering candles that has grown outside the gutted building.
	   The hunger for any answer at all was apparent at an afternoon
news conference when chief prosecutor Hans Carlsson was describing
the investigation and used the Swedish word for ''scene of the
crime.''
	   Journalists immediately barraged him with questions: Why do you
use that word; does it mean the fire definitely was set?
	   ''It was a slip of the tongue,'' Carlsson said. ''We have not
arrested anyone. We have no suspect.''
	   ''Such a fire site is considered to be a crime scene until the
opposite is proved,'' said Ralf Johansson, head of the Goteborg
police's technical division.
	   That is exactly what investigators have not been able to prove,
and speculation that the fire was set ran high.
	   The newspaper Expressen reported Sunday that police were told
just hours after the devastating blaze that one of the 162 injured
claimed to know who set the fire.
	   The Aftonbladet newspaper reported meanwhile that several teens
had been ejected from the dance shortly before the fire began, a
detail raising the possibility that they might have set the blaze
in revenge.
	   The newspaper also reported that one of the dance arrangers
noticed that the fusebox for the dance's sound system had at least
one fuse replaced by a nail.
	   Witness reports on how the fire started have given different
versions.
	   Timur Sklyavov, 16, told The Associated Press on Sunday that he
had been dancing near one of the loudspeakers and saw it explode.
He saidd his 15-year-old girfriend died in the fire.
	   ''I was dancing (by myself) so I didn't know where she was. I
feel guilty,'' he said, close to tears as he stood near the flowers
and candles at the fire site. ''When I saw the fire, I ran out.''
	   But the disc jockey has said he first saw smoke coming up the
emergency exit stairway, located just behind where the sound system
was set up.
	   It's known that fire blocked dancers from using that staircase,
forcing panicked dancers to seek escape by fleeing for the one
remaining stairway or leaping out of second-story windows. The hall
was crowded to far more than its legal capacity of 150; witnesses
have estimated the crowd as large as 400 people.
	   The fact that the emergency exit was burning ``is a circumstance
that indicates the fire could have been set,'' Johansson was quoted
as telling the newspaper Aftonbladet.
	   Witnesses have said the emergency exit stairway was crowded with
wooden furniture, Expressen reported.
	   Many of the victims were immigrants or children of immigrants.
	   The horror fell especially hard on the Shaker family:
12-year-old Jasmin Shaker and her sister, 17-year-old Meriam, both
died in the fire and another sister, Shirin, 13, is hospitalized
with injuries. Meriam had escaped the blazing hall, but died when
she went back in to try to save Jasmin.
	   Like the Shaker girls, many of the victims were immigrants from
troubled countries, or children of immigrant parents.
	   ``We left Iraq 18 years ago. We didn't want our children to grow
up with war and bombs. And then this happens,'' the girls' uncle,
Hassan Bakir, was quoted as saying in Expressen.

South Africa beats West Indies for Wills Cup
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS purse in new graf 3, South Africa and West Indies to play
test and one-day series next in graf 7. Minor editing throughout. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Playing its first cricket tournament in
muggy Dhaka, South Africa easily chased down the West Indies to win
the inaugural Wills International Cup Sunday.
	   South Africa finished at 248 for six in 47 overs, fueled by
captain Hansie Cronje's 61 and his astute leadership. South Africa
had won the toss and elected first to field, from where it held the
West Indies to 245 in 49.3.
	   The tournament win meant a dlrs 100,000 check for South Africa,
and dlrs 60,000 for runner-up West Indies.
	   The Windies were led by the powerful Phillo Wallace with 103, a
score that included five sixes and 11 fours.
	   South Africa's Jacques Kallis, the man of the match,
kick-started the Windies' collapse. His haul of five for 30
included the dismissal of Carl Hooper, who scored 49. South African
skipper Cronje was three for 44.
	   The Windies' biggest blow came when captain Brian Lara was
bowled around his legs by off-spinner Derek Crookes. Lara left with
an 11 that included a brilliant six.
	   South Africa and the West Indies fly out of Dhaka Monday to play
a test and a one-day series in South Africa.
	   Though Bangladesh was the host, its team was not among the nine
taking part in the tournament because it does not have Test status.
The tournament gave sports-crazy Bangladeshis a rare chance to see
the best of cricket at home.
	   ``We really enjoyed playing here,'' South African captain Hansie
Cronje told a cheering crowd after Sunday's final. ``It's the first
time we've come here as the South African team, and we hope to get
an invitation back.''
	   The West Indies had easily beat India by six wickets Saturday to
set up the final with South Africa. South Africa beat world
champions Sri Lanka in its semifinal on Friday. The other
competitors were Zimbabwe, New Zealand, Australia, England, and
Pakistan.
	   The International Cricket Council knockout tournament was the
only multi-sided meet before the World Cup in England next year.
	   Because a clear winner was needed in every game, organizers had
planned that in case of a tie, five bowlers from each side would
bowl to break the bails without any batsmen or fielders. Bowling
was to have continued until the fate of the match was decided. The
unusual tie-breaker, known as a bowl-out, never made its debut in
Dhaka.

	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ Britain's John Bayliss secured the pole
position for the Damascus-leg of the 22,000-kilometer (13,640-mile)
London to Cape Town Rally on Sunday, the first time the race has
ever passed through Syria.
	   Bayliss, driving a 1965 Ford Mustang model 38, led a pack of 82
classic and performance cars, finished the 490 kilometers (304
miles) from the Turkish border to Syria in 8 hours, ending the 10th
day of the race near the Meridien Hotel in Damascus.
	   The drivers, after an evening's rest, will continue to Jordan
and work their way south to the finish line in Cape Town, South
Africa. They are expected to complete the race by Dec. 4.
	   The rally is organized by the International Automobile
Federation, and the Syrian Automobile Club will supervise the race
on its various stages in Syria.
	   Drivers from Britain, the Netherlands, the United States,
Cyprus, Portugal, Australia, Malta, Belgium, Austria, Denmark,
Ireland, Germany, Spain, the Czech Republic, Zimbabwe and India are
participating in the rally.

First large group of South African soldiers to leave Lesotho
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MASERU, South Africa (AP) _ A group of 600 South African
soldiers was preparing to leave Lesotho on Monday after more than a
month of peacekeeping, officials said.
	   The battalion would be the first large group to withdraw from
this tiny mountain kingdom that has been plagued by political
strife since August, according to Lt. Col. Peter de Waal of the
Southern African Development Community task force in Maseru.
	   There are currently 3,500 troops from South Africa and Botswana
who helped the Lesotho government put down an army mutiny and
growing political dissent, the South African Press Association
reported. Dozens died in what had been expected to be a peaceful
intervention.
	   South African Safety and Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi said
that opposition parties have agreed to accept a proposed interim
committee to prepare for new elections and propose a more
democratic and representative electoral system, SAPA reported
Sunday.
	   Parliament on Friday approved the committee.
	   In May's elections, opposition parties received 39 percent of
the vote but only one of 80 seats in Parliament.
	   Tentative agreement on the committee earlier this month was
shaken after the government arrested 30 military officers it
charged had supported the mutiny.
	   The wives of the detained soldiers on Sunday claimed they have
been harassed and threatened at visiting time.

U.S. official says fear still hindering return of refugees

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Fear of Serb police and Yugoslav
soldiers continues to prevent refugees from returning home, though
significant progress has occurred in implementing the Kosovo peace
deal, a senior U.S. official said Sunday.
	   After visiting two villages in western Kosovo and meeting with a
range of relief officials, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Julia
Taft said conditions in the war-torn province were much better than
during her previous visit two months ago.
	   While many of the 50,000 or more refugees who had been living in
the woods have returned to villages, some still were staying away
from their homes, she said.
	   ``It's difficult to say that everybody is able to go back home
or is willing to go back home,'' Taft told a news conference.
``There is fear among the population.''
	   She saw that fear firsthand earlier, during a visit to an ethnic
Albanian compound in the foothills south of Pec, 100 kilometers (60
miles) west of Pristina.
	   Family members complained that Serb police harass them, arrest
people and make them feel unsafe, despite the Oct. 12 agreement
between Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and U.S. envoy
Richard Holbrooke to bring peace to the province.
	   They said only international troops, not the unarmed foreign
verification force being created, could solve their problem.
	   ``The Westerners are not going to solve the problem,'' Taft told
the family. ``The people who live here must come to an agreement to
solve their problem.''
	   But the head of the family, who asked that his name not be used
because he feared retribution by Serb police, told her: ``I don't
think that it will be possible.''
	   Taft later said Serb police had decreased their visibility,
noting she passed only three checkpoints during her travels Sunday,
compared to the dozens that used to exist.
	   Acknowledging that even a small police presence concerned
residents, she called the creation of a civilian police force in
Kosovo a ``high priority'' for the international community.
	   ``My sense is that until there is a credible civilian police
presence in the villages and towns, you won't have the confidence
necessary'' for people to resume their normal lives, Taft said.
	   She also expressed concern for reports that Serb police and
ethnic Albanian guerrillas were detaining people.
	   Also Sunday, the ethnic Albanian 0Kosovo Liberation Army said
its self-styled ``military court'' sentenced two Serbian
journalists two weeks ago to 60 days imprisonment.
	   Despite protests by Red Cross and others, the KLA has rejected
freeing them or allowing visits by international representatives.

	   GENEVA (AP) _ A hunting gun which once belonged to the French
emperor Napoleon was stolen from a Geneva museum in a daring
overnight raid, state police said Sunday.
	   The thieves scaled the walls of the Museum of Swiss History late
Saturday night and smashed the glass case protecting the exhibit.
	   Although they set off the building's alarm system, they managed
to escape without being caught.
	   Police had no details of the age of value of the hunting gun.

Reports: signs point to arson in Swedish fire that killed 60
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS time element for fire and locator for Goteborg. &QL; 
 &UR; With AP Photos &QL; 
 &UR; By JAN M. OLSEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GOTEBORG, Sweden (AP) _ Officials offered no word Sunday on what
might have caused the dance-hall fire that killed 60 young people,
but reports of grim possibilities abounded in newspapers.
	   And while the officials were telling journalists that they had
no answer to the technical question of why the fire happened,
thousands of Goteborg's residents came to the fire site to lay
flowers, light candles and grapple with the philosophical ``why?''
that plagues anyone gripped by tragedy.
	   ``Why wasn't I there?'' sobbed a young woman as she turned away
from the 200-meter-long (600-foot-long) mound of bouquets and
flickering candles that has grown outside the gutted building.
	   The hunger for any answer at all was apparent at an afternoon
news conference when chief prosecutor Hans Carlsson was describing
the investigation into the fire that broke out just before midnight
Thursday and used the Swedish word for ``scene of the crime.''
	   Journalists immediately barraged him with questions: Why do you
use that word; does it mean the fire definitely was set?
	   ``It was a slip of the tongue,'' Carlsson said. ``We have not
arrested anyone. We have no suspect.''
	   ``Such a fire site is considered to be a crime scene until the
opposite is proved,'' said Ralf Johansson, head of the police
technical division in Goteborg.
	   That is exactly what investigators have not been able to prove,
and speculation that the fire was set ran high.
	   The newspaper Expressen reported Sunday that police were told
just hours after the devastating blaze that one of the 162 injured
claimed to know who set the fire.
	   The Aftonbladet newspaper reported meanwhile that several teens
had been ejected from the dance shortly before the fire began, a
detail raising the possibility that they might have set the blaze
in revenge.
	   The newspaper also reported that one of the dance arrangers
noticed that the fusebox for the dance's sound system had at least
one fuse replaced by a nail.
	   Witness reports on how the fire started have given different
versions.
	   Timur Sklyavov, 16, told The Associated Press on Sunday that he
had been dancing near one of the loudspeakers and saw it explode.
He saidd his 15-year-old girfriend died in the fire.
	   ``I was dancing (by myself) so I didn't know where she was. I
feel guilty,'' he said, close to tears as he stood near the flowers
and candles at the fire site. ``When I saw the fire, I ran out.''
	   But the disc jockey has said he first saw smoke coming up the
emergency exit stairway, located just behind where the sound system
was set up.
	   It's known that fire blocked dancers from using that staircase,
forcing panicked dancers to seek escape by fleeing for the one
remaining stairway or leaping out of second-story windows. The hall
was crowded to far more than its legal capacity of 150; witnesses
have estimated the crowd as large as 400 people.
	   The fact that the emergency exit was burning ``is a circumstance
that indicates the fire could have been set,'' Johansson was quoted
as telling the newspaper Aftonbladet.
	   Witnesses have said the emergency exit stairway was crowded with
wooden furniture, Expressen reported.
	   Many of the victims were immigrants or children of immigrants.
	   The horror fell especially hard on the Shaker family:
12-year-old Jasmin Shaker and her sister, 17-year-old Meriam, both
died in the fire and another sister, Shirin, 13, is hospitalized
with injuries. Meriam had escaped the blazing hall, but died when
she went back in to try to save Jasmin.
	   Like the Shaker girls, many of the victims were immigrants from
troubled countries, or children of immigrant parents.
	   ``We left Iraq 18 years ago. We didn't want our children to grow
up with war and bombs. And then this happens,'' the girls' uncle,
Hassan Bakir, was quoted as saying in Expressen.
	   Goteborg, with 435,000 is Sweden's second-largest city, on the
country's west coast some 500 kilometers (300 miles) southwest of
Stockholm.

Disputed island reverts to Yemeni control
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SANA`A, Yemen (AP) _ As Eritrean forces withdrew, Yemen's flag
Sunday was raised once again over the Red Sea island of Greater
Hanish, effectively ending a nearly three-year dispute between
Yemen and Eritrea over control of the island.
	   The ceremony, which was attended by Yemeni Defense Minister
Mohammed Dhaifullah Mohammed, is the final step in the hand over of
the disputed island.
	   Yemen and Eritrea fought a battle over three Red Sea islands in
December 1995. Eritrea captured Greater Hanish island, while Yemen
retained control of Lesser Hanish and Zuqar.
	   On Oct. 9, the World Court awarded all three islands to Yemen
and stipulated that its decision should be honored within 90 days.
	   The hand over was a ``step toward security in the Red Sea,''
Mohammed told The Associated Press.
	   The decision leaves Yemen free to develop the islands for
tourism, scuba diving, oil and other enterprises.
	   The islands sit across one of the world's major shipping lanes,
160 kilometers (100 miles) north of the Bab el-Mandeb strait at the
southern entrance to the Red Sea.
	   Marring the festivities was the death of one Yemeni soldier who
drowned when a dingy carrying him to the island overturned.

South African deputy president arrives in Saudi
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ South African Deputy President Thabo
Mbeki arrived in Saudi Arabia Sunday for a three-day trip aimed at
increasing trade between the two nations.
	   Mbeki will meet with Saudi King Fahd and Crown Prince Abdullah,
his office said in a statement.
	   Mbeki is accompanied by a high-level delegation including
Defense Minister Joe Modise and Trade and Industry Minister Alec
Erwin.
	   Mbeki, who became the ruling African National Congress'
president last year and is expected to win the 1999 presidential
elections, is scheduled to meet with Defense Minister Prince Sultan
on Tuesday.
	   He will also visit the industrial cities of Yanbu and Jubail and
meet with members of the Saudi Chamber of Commerce and Industry,
the statement said.
	   The two sides are expected to discuss a much talked about
oil-for-arms deal. The dlrs 1.5 billion sale of G6 motorized
artillery pieces and anti-aircraft weapons to Saudi Arabia, if
finalized, would be the largest arms deal in South African history
and could create 30,000 jobs over five years.
	   Economic relations between the two nations have been growing in
recent years. South Africa is trying to rely less on Iran for oil,
from which it imports more than two-thirds of its crude oil needs,
according to South African press reports.
	   In a visit to Saudi Arabia last year, President Nelson Mandela
signed a preliminary agreement with the oil-rich kingdom which
calls for oil imports of 15,000 barrels a day from Saudi Arabia.
	   The memorandum of understanding also calls for joint efforts to
build new refineries, Mandela had said without giving details.
	   South Africa's exports to Saudi Arabia more than doubled from
dlrs 47 million in 1994 to dlrs 95 million in 1996. Saudi Arabia's
exports, mainly oil, jumped from dlrs 8 million in 1994 to dlrs 207
million in 1996.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Fear of Serb police and Yugoslav
soldiers continues to prevent ethnic Albanian refugees from
returning home, although conditions have approved under the Kosovo
peace deal, a senior U.S. official said Sunday.
	   After visiting two villages in western Kosovo, U.S. Assistant
Secretary of State Julia Taft said conditions in the war-torn
province were much better than during her previous visit two months
ago.
	   While many of the 50,000 or more refugees who had been living in
the woods have returned to villages, some still were staying away,
she said.
	   ``It's difficult to say that everybody is able to go back home
or is willing to go back home,'' Taft said. ``There is fear among
the population.''
	   Taft meet with ethnic Albanian refugees during a visit to a
compound in the foothills south of Pec, 100 kilometers (60 miles)
west of Pristina.
	   The refugees complained that Serb police harassment has
continued despite the Oct. 12 agreement between Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic and U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke to halt a
seven-month crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo.
	   Hundreds of people have died in fighting that sent an estimated
300,000 people fleeing the troubled southern Serbian province,
where ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs 9 to 1. Serbia is the
dominant republic in Yugoslavia.
	   The refugees said only international troops, not the unarmed
foreign verification force being created, could solve their
problem.
	   ``The Westerners are not going to solve the problem,'' Taft told
one refugee family. ``The people who live here must come to an
agreement to solve their problem.''
	   But the head of the family, who asked that his name not be used
because he feared retribution by Serb police, told her: ``I don't
think that it will be possible.''
	   Also Sunday, the ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army said its
``military court'' sentenced two Serbian journalists two weeks ago
to 60 days imprisonment.
	   Despite protests by Red Cross and others, the KLA has rejected
freeing them or allowing visits by international representatives.

German Protestant leader welcomes citizenship law changes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MUENSTER, Germany (AP) _ The leader of Germany's Protestant
churches welcomed on Sunday Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's plans to
loosen German citizenship laws, adding that religion should not be
a reason to keep someone from becoming German.
	   ``Just because the number of Muslims in Germany will rise
considerably must not be a reason to decide against it,'' said
Manfred Kock, chairman of the governing council of the Evangelical
Church in Germany (EKD).
	   Proposed changes, such as allowing for dual citizenship, will
mean greater security for those affected, he said in a report to
the Synod, the EKD's main legislative body, which is meeting in
Muenster.
	   Many of Germany's 2 million Turks, the largest group of
foreigners in Germany, are expected to take advantage of easier
citizenship rules planned by Schroeder's new center-left coalition.
	   Former chancellor Helmut Kohl's conservative government had
resisted changing the ethnicity-based law during its 16 years in
power, arguing Germany should not become a multicultural land of
immigrants.
	   The EKD comprises 24 largely independent Lutheran, Reformed and
United regional churchs.

Town in southern Italy now lives off luck as well as tourism

<TEXT>
	   PESCHICI, Italy (AP) _ This tiny town clinging to the rocky
coast lives off tourism, and, starting Sunday, off a lot of luck,
dlrs 39.3 million worth of it.
	   Peschici won big in Saturday night's drawing of the Super
Enalotto game, which yielded a top prize after 11 straight winless
draws that had Italians all over the country feverishly trying to
guess the lucky six numbers as they sweated out waits in line to
buy game cards.
	   Ninety-nine shares of the winning series of numbers were sold in
this hamlet of a barely 4,000 souls, meaning, counting in-laws,
cousins and other members of the extended family system common in
small towns like this, a good chunk of Peschici woke up richer on
Sunday.
	   Coming in the underdeveloped south, where little stock is put in
decades-old promises by the state to create jobs and youth often
turn to organized crime for work, Peschici's clever pulling
together to try to beat long odds -- a one in 622 million shot at
guessing right -- was seen as proof honest enterprise can pay off.
	   ``This time fortune was not blind,'' said the anchorwoman on
private TV network Channel 5.
	   The owner of the town's sole newsstand, Domenico ``Mimi''
Lamargese, had devised a ``system,'' a combination of numbers that
hadn't come up for while, and sought takers in Peschici, a resort
on the mountainous, pine-forested ``spur'' of boot-shaped Italy.
	   After a sleepless night of fireworks and dancing in the main
square, on Sunday morning the town band -- men, women and children
decked out in crisply pressed, double-breasted blue blazers and
black hats -- paraded down the main street, playing tunes of joy
for the winners, who included the jobless, students, fishermen,
bricklayers, artisans and homemakers.
	   Each dlr-15 investment paid roughly dlrs 400,000, which could
buy a few nice, whitewashed houses here overlooking the Adriatic.
The entire ``system'' cost roughly dlrs 1,500, since the more
numbers you play, the more you pay.
	   A total of some 183 million combinations were played.
	   The newsstand owners said he bought a half a share for himself,
for about a dlrs 200,000 win. He said part of the win would let him
finish off car payments.

Next two games decisive for Simoni future, Inter president says
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Rome-Soccer-Italian roundup &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Gigi Simoni's future as coach of
Internazionale of Milan will depend on the outcome of the next two
games, club president Massimo Moratti said Sunday.
	   Angered by Inter's third consecutive defeat in league matches
Moratti said ``the two next games will be decisive'' for Simoni.
	   He suggested the coach would be fired in case of disappointing
performances and results.
	   On Wednesday Inter plays a decisive Champions Cup rotation match
against Spartak Moscow. On Sunday it takes on crosstown rival AC
Milan in a league game crucial for both teams.
	   Simoni, on his second season at the helm of Inter, has been
facing growing criticism following a difficult start in the current
campaign.
	   Inter fell six points behind league leader Juventus following
Sunday's humiliating 3-2 home loss to low-ranked Bari. It came
after a 1-0 defeat against Juventus in Turin and a 5-3 home rout by
Lazio.
	   Simoni lamented that he could not field the best team because of
injuries which repeatedly sidelined Brazilian star-striker Ronaldo
and other key players.
	   Fabio Capello, dismissed by AC Milan last season, has been
rumored as a possible substitute of Simoni who led Inter to the
UEFA Cup title and to second place in the Italian league in the
previous campaign.
	   Moratti also said he planned to reduce Inter's 25-player roster
to cut a dlrs 27.1 million deficit posted by the Milan club in its
last fiscal year.
	   Inter's roster includes several expensive international stars
such as Nigerian Taribo West, Diego Simeone and Javier Zanetti of
Argentina, France's Youri Djorkaeff and Benoir Cauet, Dutch Aron
Winter, Brazilians Ronaldo and Ze Elias, Uruguayan Alvaro Recoba,
Chilean veteran Ivan Zamorano, Portuguese Paulo Sousa and Italy's
Roberto Baggio.

Police forensic report says no torture in southern village
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Allegations that 15 Coptic Christians were
tortured by police during reported mass arrests are unfounded, said
a forensic report by police doctors released Sunday.
	   The report was part of the government's investigation into
charges that police in the southern village of El-Kusheh arrested
hundreds of people over a period of three weeks, torturing and
threatening many with rape in their search for a murderer.
	   The allegations, carried widely by the foreign media, were a
political embarrassment for Egypt, which insists that its minority
population of Orthodox Christians are not subjected to
discrimination.
	   Egyptian human rights groups claimed that hundreds were arrested
and many tortured. Human rights officials said this was not because
they were Christians, but because torture is part of ordinary
police practice in Egypt.
	   Reporters who went to el-Kusheh were met by villagers who showed
them bruises on their wrists that they said were from ropes used to
hang them from the ceiling. They also said they were subjected to
electric shocks, and showed marks on their ears, stomachs and
genitals.
	   The government has said that only 14 people were detained as
part of ``an ordinary criminal investigation.'' It was unclear if
the 15 people talked to by police doctors were among those seen by
reporters.
	   Both Egyptian and international human rights groups have charged
for years that Egypt employs torture in interrogations and against
prisoners. Egypt has consistently denied the reports.
	   On Sunday, a police official cited the forensic report as saying
of 15 people examined by doctors, some showed no indication of
torture, while some had skin diseases which have persisted long
before the alleged torture.
	   Another five, complaining of ear and throat problems, were
referred to ear, nose and throat specialists for further
investigation, the police official said. He spoke on customary
conditions of anonymity.

Netanyahu hecklers arrested at Rabin memorial

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Several Israelis were arrested Sunday for
heckling Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at a memorial ceremony
for Yitzhak Rabin, assassinated three years ago.
	   As Netanyahu laid a wreath on Rabin's grave at Jerusalem's Mt.
Herzl cemetery, one demonstrator shouted, ``You incited to
murder.'' Others called out ``murderer, murderer,''
	   None of the hecklers approached Netanyahu, who is guarded by
several armed secret servicemen and many police officers wherever
he goes. Police spokeswoman Linda Menuhin said five people were
arrested at the ceremony on incitement charges.
	   Netanyahu, leader of the opposition when Rabin was prime
minister, has been blamed by both Rabin's family and members of the
left-wing Labor party for contributing to the violent political
atmosphere leading up to the assassination.
	   On November 4, 1995, Rabin was shot and killed as he left a
peace rally in Tel Aviv by a Jewish ultranationalist bent on
stopping Rabin's land-for-peace policies with the Palestinians.
	   In a speech to Israel's Knesset, Netanyahu tried to shake off
the blame. ``There is no place and no justification to accuse an
entire public for the guilt of a sole person,'' he said. Netanyahu
said that while he disagreed with Rabin's policies, he aimed to
achieve a peace that would unify Israelis.
	   On Sunday, Netanyahu and other Israeli leaders marked the third
anniversary of the killing according to the Jewish calendar with a
somber ceremony at Rabin's graveside.
	   Israel's Cabinet opened its weekly meeting with a minute of
silence in memory of Rabin and Israel's parliament held a special
session in memory of the former Israeli premier, defense minister
and war hero.
	   On Saturday in Tel Aviv, some 300,000 Israelis jammed the square
where Rabin was killed and stood shoulder-to-shoulder on streets
for blocks in all directions, to pay tribute to Rabin and voice
support for the continuation of the Israeli-Palestinian peace
process he began.
	   On Sunday, hundreds of people stopped by a permanent memorial at
the square, now named for Rabin, to light candles and write
messages of peace.
	   Israeli flags were lowered to half-staff on government buildings
and at army bases.
	   Israel's government decreed an annual memorial day for the only
Israeli leader to be assassinated, but did not declare it a work or
government holiday.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu laid a wreath
at a graveside memorial ceremony as Israel paid solemn tribute
Sunday to Yitzhak Rabin, three years after his assassination.
	   At Jerusalem's Mt. Herzl cemetery where Israeli leaders, family
and dignitaries gathered to lay flowers and stones, a Jewish
tradition, several Israelis heckled Netanyahu and shouted
``murderer, murderer.''
	   On November 4, 1995, Rabin was shot and killed as he left a
peace rally in Tel Aviv by a Jewish ultranationalist bent on
stopping Rabin's land-for-peace policies with the Palestinians.
	   Netanyahu, leader of the opposition when Rabin was prime
minister, was blamed by both Rabin's family and members of the
left-wing Labor party for contributing to the violent political
atmosphere leading up to the assassination.
	   None of the unarmed hecklers approached Netanyahu, but their
shouts clearly disturbed the somber ceremony. Police spokeswoman
Linda Menuhin said five people were arrested for incitement.
	   In a speech to Israel's Knesset, Netanyahu said ``there is no
place and no justification to accuse an entire public for the guilt
of a sole person,'' he said. Netanyahu said that while he disagreed
with Rabin's policies, he aimed to achieve a peace which would
unify Israelis.
	   ``We are one people, with one fate, with one hope in one
country. I pray that we can extend hands to each other and together
put out the flame of hate without distorting the disagreements
between us, because peace is made first between brothers,''
Netanyahu said.
	   On the third anniversary of Rabin's death according to the
Jewish calendar, Netanyahu opened his weekly Cabinet meeting with a
minute of silence and Israel's parliament held a special session in
memory of the former Israeli premier, defense minister and war
hero.
	   Saturday in Tel Aviv, some 300,000 Israelis jammed the square
where Rabin was killed and stood shoulder-to-shoulder on streets
for blocks in all directions, to pay tribute and voice support for
the continuation of the Israeli-Palestinian peace process he began.
	   Sunday, hundreds more stopped by a permanent memorial at the
square now named for Rabin to light candles and write messages of
peace at the site.
	   Israeli flags were lowered to half-staff on government buildings
and at army bases.
	   At many Israeli schools, students gathered for memorial
ceremonies and discussions about the meaning of the assassination
to Israel's future. Radio and television channels broadcast
documentaries and discussions about Rabin's life and his violent
death.
	   Israel's government decreed an annual memorial day for the only
Israeli leader to be assassinated, but did not declare it a work or
government holiday.
	   President Ezer Weizman lit a memorial candle at his official
residence, beginning the day of remembrance. Representatives of
many segments of Israeli society attended the smaller ceremony,
where Weizman warned that the lessons of Rabin's assassination had
not been learned.
	   ``Could it happen again?'' asked the Israeli president, a
retired Air Force commander and veteran peace activist now in a
largely ceremonial role. He answered his own question, warning, ``I
regret to say that lately there are signs that the answer is not
necessarily a no.''
	   After Netanyahu signed a recent peace agreement with Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat, in which Israel will turn over another 13.1
percent of the West Bank to the Palestinians, there have been
violent demonstrations against the government, recalling some of
the protests before Rabin was killed.

Stabaek defeats Rosenborg to take Norwegian Cup final
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Stabaek took the Norwegian Cup Final Sunday
by defeating Rosenborg 3-1 in extra time.
	   The victory confirmed Stabaek's dominance of Rosenborg this
season. Stabaek had three victories and one tied game against the
league champions from Trondheim.
	   Rosenborg put the pressure on in the first five minutes of the
game, but Icelander Helgi Sigurdsson was left alone with Rosenborg
goalie Jorn Jamtfall and easily made it 1-0.
	   Stabaek gained momentum and forwards Sigurdsson and Petter
Belsvik made life difficult for the Rosenborg defense.
	   However, Rosenborg evened the score in the 64th minute on a
penalty goal by Sigurd Rushfeldt.
	   Neither team scored again and extra time was needed.
	   In the 99th minute, Jamtfall dropped an apparently easy ball,
and substitute Thomas Finstad took advantage, making it 2-1.
	   ``I thought I was all alone, but I lost the ball,'' Jamtfall
said. ``It was a high ball, and that is some of the worse
situations for a goalkeeper. The goal was my mistake.''
	   Sigurdsson made it 3-1 in the 106th, winning Stabaek's first cup
triumph.
	   Rosenborg faces Galatasaray of Turkey away in Wednesday's fourth
rotation in the Champions League.

German Internet users strike over telephone costs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Thousands of Internet sites in Germany went blank
Sunday as part of a protest over Deutsche Telekom's rates for
connecting to cyberspace.
	   Thomas von Treichel, who organized the Internet strike, said
more than 6,000 Internet sites joined the action. The 7.5 million
Germans with Internet access were also encouraged to stay off-line
Sunday, but it was not known how many surfers participated.
	   Strike organizers are demanding Telekom, the former state-owned
telephone monopoly, institute a special rate of no more than 1 mark
(63 cents) an hour for Internet connections. Current telephone
charges during the day for local connections are around 5 marks
(dlrs 3.13) an hour.
	   Telekom officials responded calmly to the protest and said plans
for lower rates had already been presented to government
regulators.

Demonstrators commemorate Stalinist executions in Belarus

<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ About 2,000 demonstrators marched Sunday
to the site of mass executions carried out under Soviet dictator
Josef Stalin, and called for an end to political persecution under
Belarus' current leader.
	   The march to the gravesite at Kuropaty, just outside the capital
of Minsk, was the 11th such observation since 1988, and brought
together many opponents of Belarusian President Alexander
Lukashenko.
	   ``The fact that we came here together means that Belarusians
have spiritual strength,'' said Yuri Khodyka, a professor who
addressed the rally.
	   ``We have a clearly marked future _ free Belarus. ... Ten years
ago the national renaissance of Belarus started, but we have been
unable for a while to conquer the system that soaked our land with
blood. We still have much to suffer.''
	   The annual observance, begun when Belarus was still part of the
Soviet Union, falls on an ancient festival day known as Dzyady. It
was, for a time, a national holiday in Belarus. Now, while its
observance is still sanctioned by the government, Lukashenko has
stopped the practice of making it a day off from work.
	   Lukashenko is openly nostalgic for the Soviet Union and his
government has downplayed the severity of the mass executions. The
country's general prosecutor has estimated that no more than 7,000
people are buried in the mass graves at Kuropaty, and says there is
no evidence they were Stalinist victims.
	   The opposition says as many as 250,000 people died there during
Stalinist purges in the 1930s and '40s.
	   Demonstrators on Sunday marched 10 kilometers (six miles) to the
site from downtown Minsk, many carrying red and white national
flags banned by Lukashenko's government and some holding pictures
of people they identified as political prisoners.
	   At Kuropaty, a crowd of about 3,000 heard speeches and laid
flowers on the mass grave and at the foot of a monument to the
victims.
	   ``Ten years ago, our people for the first time in the post-war
history of Belarus took part in a mass rally to protest against
totalitarianism,'' Zintsuk Vyachorka, deputy chairman of the
National Front, told reporters.
	   ``It was then that the spiritual health of the nation started to
recover. Not all is good with it now,'' he continued, but added
that ``every holiday of Dzyady is another step toward becoming a
nation.''
	   Belarus is an independent nation, but the nationalist opposition
worries that Lukashenko is bringing it closer to a reunion with
Russia.

Monty finishes top again as Clarke wins final event
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS detail, quotes &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JEREZ, Spain (AP) _ Colin Montgomerie finished top of the
European PGA Tour money list for an unprecedented sixth year in a
row Sunday after a third place finish at the Volvo Masters, which
was won by Northern Ireland's Darren Clarke with a 9-under 63.
	   Starting the final round one stroke behind his main rival and
joint tournament leader Lee Westwood, Montgomerie carded a 4-under
68 at the Montecastillo course for a 14-under total of 274 to
finish behind Clarke and fellow Scot Andrew Coltart.
	   ``All I can say is that it's getting tougher,'' Montgomerie said
after his latest triumph. ``Everyone else is improving all the time
and I have had to go along with that, otherwise I would have been
overtaken.''
	   While Montgomerie made few mistakes all day, collecting five
birdies against a bogey 5 at the 15th, it was all over for Westwood
when he twice drove out of bounds from the tee at the 172-yard 14th
and made a quadruple bogey seven. He finished with a 75 for a
four-round total of 280 and a share of 12th.
	   ``I played poorly. I struggled all day,'' said the Englishman,
who drove into a bunker for a bogey at the second and collected
only one birdie in the first 11 holes.
	   ``My chances had gone even by the 14th. It was the start of my
round that let me down. After that I never really had a chance.''
	   Clarke, the only other player capable of overtaking Montgomerie
and Westwood on the money list, made a course record-equalling
9-under 63 in the final round for a 17-under total of 271.
	   He birdied four of the first five holes, eagled the 517-yard
par-5 ninth and added three more birdies on the way home. The burly
Northern Ireland player took home the first prize of 166,000 pounds
(dlrs 277,220) and wound up second in the overall money list behind
Monty and ahead of Westwood.
	   ``Darren Clarke put the pressure on me right away when he eagled
the 9th to go 14 under,'' Montgomerie said. ``It was his tournament
from then on.''
	   Coltart finished runner up in the tournament after a 66 left him
two strokes behind, squandering his chance by three-putting the
third and missing a birdie chance at the last.
	   Montgomerie went into the tournament leading the European Tour
money list with winnings of 760,077 (dlrs 1,276,929). Westwood was
No. 2 at 714,812 (dlrs 1,200,884) followed by Clarke at 616,867
(dlrs 1,036,337).
	   To finish top, Clarke had to win the championship and hope that
Montgomerie finished ninth or lower with Westwood not in the top
three.
	   By finishing top yet again, Montgomerie also collected 170,000
pounds (dlrs 284,000) from the bonus pool, taking his total for the
year to 993,077 pounds (dlrs 1.66 million).
	   Clarke's victory meant he earned a total of 286,000 pounds (dlrs
477,600) including bonus money to take his season's total to
902,687 (dlrs 1.51 million).

Next two games decisive for Simoni future, Inter president says
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Sports-Soccer-Italian roundup &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Gigi Simoni's future as coach of
Internazionale of Milan will depend on the outcome of the next two
games, club president Massimo Moratti said Sunday.
	   Angered by Inter's third consecutive defeat in league matches,
Moratti said, ``the two next games will be decisive'' for Simoni.
	   On Wednesday, Inter plays a Champions Cup rotation match against
Spartak Moscow. On Sunday it takes on crosstown rival AC Milan in a
league game crucial for both teams.
	   Simoni, on his second season at the helm of Inter, has been
facing growing criticism following a difficult start in the current
campaign.
	   Inter fell six points behind league leader Juventus following
Sunday's humiliating 3-2 home loss to low-ranked Bari. It came
after a 1-0 defeat against Juventus in Turin and a 5-3 home rout by
Lazio.
	   Simoni lamented that he could not field the best team because of
injuries which repeatedly sidelined Brazilian star-striker Ronaldo
and other key players.
	   Fabio Capello, dismissed by AC Milan last season, has been
rumored as a possible substitute for Simoni, who led Inter to the
UEFA Cup title and to second place in the Italian league last
season.
	   Moratti also said he planned to reduce Inter's 25-player roster
to cut a dlrs 27.1 million deficit posted by the Milan club in its
last fiscal year.
	   Inter's roster includes several expensive international stars
such as Nigerian Taribo West, Diego Simeone and Javier Zanetti of
Argentina, France's Youri Djorkaeff and Benoir Cauet, Dutchman Aron
Winter, Brazilians Ronaldo and Ze Elias, Uruguayan Alvaro Recoba,
Chilean veteran Ivan Zamorano, Portugal's Paulo Sousa and Italy's
Roberto Baggio.

Disputed island reverts to Yemeni control

<TEXT>
	   SANA`A, Yemen (AP) _ As Eritrean forces withdrew, Yemen's flag
Sunday was raised once again over the Red Sea island of Greater
Hanish, effectively ending a nearly three-year dispute between
Yemen and Eritrea over control of the island.
	   The ceremony, which was attended by Yemeni Defense Minister
Mohammed Dhaifullah Mohammed, is the final step in the hand over of
the disputed island.
	   Yemen and Eritrea fought a battle over three Red Sea islands in
December 1995. Eritrea captured Greater Hanish island, while Yemen
retained control of Lesser Hanish and Zuqar.
	   On Oct. 9, the International Court of Arbitration - a panel of
experts based in The Hague - awarded all three islands to Yemen and
stipulated that its decision should be honored within 90 days. The
court's decisions are legally binding.

Ominous milestone on peace road: first Hamas threat against Arafat
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. Recasts, INCORPORATES Palestinian-Hamas, changes byline
 &UR; AP Photos &QL; 
 &UR; By LAURA KING &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The military arm of the radical Islamic group
Hamas made an unprecedented threat Sunday against Yasser Arafat,
demanding in a leaflet that the Palestinian leader halt a crackdown
against it or face violent vengeance.
	   In recent days, Arafat's security forces have rounded up more
than 100 Hamas activists, detained some of its top political
leaders and put its ailing, charismatic founder, Sheik Ahmed
Yassin, under house arrest.
	   That crackdown _ and the Hamas demand to halt it _ marked a
spectacular smash-up of the uneasy peace that had prevailed between
Arafat and Hamas over the past 14 months, ever since Yassin was
released from Israeli prison and returned to his faithful following
in the Gaza Strip.
	   Up until now, in deference to Arafat's enduring role as a symbol
of Palestinian unity, Hamas had stopped short of direct threats
against him. But the leaflet _ faxed to news organizations in the
name of Hamas' Izzedine al Qassam brigades _ specifically accused
the Palestinian leader by name of having ``reached the point of
treason'' by moving against Hamas.
	   It called for an immediate end to the crackdown in order to
spare Palestinians ``the horrors ... of civil war'' and Arafat's
camp the ``fires of revenge.''
	   The threats cast a pall over efforts to begin implementing the
9-day-old peace agreement this week, but as of Sunday, Israel and
the Palestinians were still pledging to do so.
	   With so many Hamas officials in jail, few were available to
vouch for the leaflet's authenticity, and none wanted to do so
publicly. But its language, style and phrasing were markedly
similar to past communications from Hamas' military wing.
	   One Palestinian government official _ Imad Falouji, the
communications minister and a former Hamas member _ said he doubted
the threats were real. Falouji, however, has been trying to act as
a mediator between Arafat and Yassin.
	   Palestinian security officials took the warnings seriously _ and
issued some of their own in response.
	   ``We have only one authority in this land, which is the
Palestinian Authority,'' said Palestinian police commander Ghazi
Jabali. ``We are going to take all measures to control the
situation.''
	   The leaflet denounced the house arrest of Yassin, whom it called
``the prince of holy warriors'' and warned Palestinian security
forces against pursuing Mohammed Deif, a top leader of Hamas'
military wing whose arrest has been demanded by Israel.
	   Strong steps by Arafat against Islamic militants are a key
provision of the Washington pact, which the leaflet referred to as
the ``black agreement.''
	   Under the accord, Palestinians are to undertake a series of
security-related measures in exchange for a handover of another
13.1 percent of the West Bank by Israel.
	   The Palestinian side said it would deliver a promised security
document to the Americans on Monday, and the Israeli Cabinet is to
begin discussing the accord on Tuesday and vote then or Wednesday.
	   Meanwhile, extremists on both sides _ hard-line Jewish settlers
on the one side, Hamas on the other _ have been trying hard to
derail the accord.
	   On Sunday, without any interference from Israeli authorities,
Jewish settlers built a fence on a disputed plot of land in
traditionally Arab east Jerusalem, infuriating the Palestinians.
	   Hamas, for its part, tried last week to blow up a school bus
carrying Jewish schoolchidlren in the Gaza Strip. The children were
unharmed but an Israeli soldier was killed.
	   Already shaken by that attack, Israel saw the threats against
the Palestinian Authority as a potentially worrisome new
complication.
	   David Bar-Illan, a top aide to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, said he did not know if the leaflet was authentic, but
that Hamas' military wing ``has been allowed to grow and to expand
to such an extent that it probably does now pose a real danger.''
	   In recent months, Yassin's rivalry with Arafat has grown more
and more pronounced. Earlier this year, the sheik made a
high-profile fundraising tour of Muslim nations during which he
harshly criticized Arafat and worked to drum up support for Hamas.
	   In what may be a bid to cash in now on that political capital,
the leaflet called on Arab leaders to pressure Arafat to halt the
crackdown. Several Arab countries have already spoken out against
the Washington accord, and Iran denounced Arafat for entering into
it.
	   Despite a slippage in Arafat's popularity, polls consistently
indicate fewer than one in five Palestinians supports Hamas. But if
smaller, Yassin's following is more fervent.
	   There are no reliable figures on the number of active Hamas
operatives, but tactics like those it has used against Israel _
bombings and guerrilla-style attacks _ would be difficult to
counteract, even with the full weight of Arafat's 40,000-member
security force.

Twenty-Two candidates run again for Bucharest mayor
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with latest turnout &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ One woman and 21 men ran again Sunday
for mayor of Romania's capital Bucharest but low turnout may force
yet another runoff next week, an election official said.
	   Only 34.4 percent of Bucharest's 1.7 million eligible voters
cast ballots a week ago, far short of the 50 percent needed for the
results to be valid.
	   But as of 6 p.m. (1700 GMT) only 28.28 percent of the voters had
cast their ballot Sunday, said Cristian Panait, head of the
Bucharest's election bureau.
	   The two leading candidates will compete next Sunday in another
turnout, Panait said. To win, a candidate needs 50 percent of the
vote.
	   The private and state television stations urged people to vote,
offering prizes to those who could prove they cast ballots.
	   ``I doubt the voters' presence will be more consistent today.
The enthusiasm manifested at the election in 1996 decreased
substantially due to the people's financial hardships,''
sociologist Alin Teodorescu said by telephone.
	   Teodorescu, who runs a respected poll institution, predicted
also that many of those who voted last week will not bother to do
so again.
	   The elections held last week cost the cashed-strapped city
budget lei 14 billion (almost dlrs 1.5 million). Many Bucharest
residents see this as a waste of money in a city plagued by housing
problems, pollution and poor infrastructure.
	   The ballot became necessary when Bucharest's last elected mayor
Victor Ciorbea became prime minister in 1996. He resigned from that
job in April, quitting the post of mayor at the same time.
	   Despite the absence of reliable opinion polls, incumbent mayor
Viorel Lis, who was Ciorbea's deputy, is thought to have the best
chance of winning.
	   His main competitors are Sorin Oprescu, head of Bucharest's
Municipal Hospital, and Alexandru Sassu, minister for relations
with parliament.

	   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) _ Rescue workers and air force
helicopters set out Sunday for a town in northern Nicaragua that
was hit by massive mudslides, killing at least 58 and pushing the
death toll of former hurricane Mitch nearly 500.
	   More than 2,400 people living in the 10 communities at the foot
of the Casitas Volcano were still unaccounted for, Mayor Felicita
Zeledon of Posoltega told the government's Radio Nicaragua. She
said 58 bodies had been pulled from the mud in her town, about 50
miles northwest of Managua.
	   ``It is like a desert littered with buried bodies,'' Zeledon
said, citing reports from rescue workers.
	   A woman who claimed to have survived the mudslides told Radio
Nicaragua on Sunday morning that she had seen thousands of bodies.
	   ``In the patios of the orchards there are many unburied
bodies,'' said Mercedes Rodriguez Zapata, who claimed to have left
the area Saturday and traveled to the capital of Managua on
horseback and on foot. ``An epidemic is feared.''

Israel warns against any easing of arms inspections in Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel, which came under the fire of Iraqi
missiles seven years ago, cautioned the international community
Sunday that Iraq still posed a danger and called for continued
United Nations weapons inspections there.
	   Saturday, Iraq announced it was banning weapons inspectors from
continuing work there until U.N. sanctions were lifted, even if the
result was military confrontation.
	   ``We hope the United Nations will show the kind of resolve and
determination that it must in order to prevent Iraq from becoming
not only a regional but an international threat,'' said David
Bar-Illan, a senior adviser to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   Bar-Illan said Iraq was a ``direct and immediate danger'' and
that any easing of the inspections could lead to Iraqi production
of missiles and nonconventional weapons ``that can reach not only
Israel but also Europe.''
	   Iraq fired 39 Scud missiles with conventional warheads at Israel
during the 1991 Gulf War.

Hezbollah chief calls for killing Israelis to scuttle peace deal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HUSSEIN DAKROUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ The leader of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah
called on Palestinians Sunday to kill Israelis to scuttle the
U.S.-brokered peace accord with Israel.
	   Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, secretary-general of the Hezbollah
guerrilla group, also urged Palestinians to chop off the hand of
their leader, Yasser Arafat, for signing the deal.
	   ``The agreement calls for ensuring security and peace for the
Israelis. This agreement should be destroyed. This can be done by
killing Israeli soldiers and Israeli settlers. Then the story
(accord) is finished,'' Nasrallah told a rally in Beirut's southern
suburbs, a Hezbollah stronghold.
	   ``Destroying the ... agreements doesn't need warplanes, tanks or
long-range missiles or even nuclear weapons,'' he said amid chants
of ``Death to Israel.''
	   ``The people of Palestine are capable of destroying this
treacherous agreement with knives,'' he said.
	   It was Nasrallah's first public comment on the Wye Plantation
peace accord signed in Washington Oct. 23 by Arafat and Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   The rally was organized by Hezbollah to protest the accord,
which calls for an Israeli withdrawal from an additional 13 percent
of the West Bank in exchange for a Palestinian security crackdown
on Islamic militants.
	   Many Arab commentators and hard-line Palestinian groups have
criticized the deal as a sell-out of Palestinian aspirations.
	   ``Today, a traitor in the name of Palestine comes to give away
the land of Palestine to the killer and criminal Zionists. This
(Arafat's) hand should be severed by the Palestinian people,''
Nasrallah said.
	   The rally was also attended by officials of radical Palestinian
guerrilla groups.
	   Hezbollah is leading a guerrilla war to oust Israeli troops and
allied Lebanese militiamen from a border enclave in southern
Lebanon.

 &UR; Kagwe wins New York City Marathon &QL; 
 &UR; By BERT ROSENTHAL &QC; 
 &UR; AP Track Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ A powerful John Kagwe ran away from Kenyan
countryman Joseph Chebet in the final yards (meters) Sunday and won
the New York City Marathon for the second straight year in the
second-closest finish in the race's 29-year history.
	   Kage, Chebert and Tanzania's Zebedayo Bayo turned into Central
Park almost even, but Bayo couldn't keep pace with the Kenyans and
fell behind.
	   Then, it was a battle between Kagwe and Chebet, the 1-2
finishers last year.
	   The stronger Kagwe proved too good for Chebet, who was
frustrated for the third straight time _ he also finished runner-up
to compatriot Moses Tanui in Boston in April.
	   Kagwe's winning time was 2 hours, 8 minutes, 45 seconds. Chebet
finished three seconds back and Bayo was third at 2:08:51.
	   The previous closest finish was two seconds, in 1994 when
Mexico's German Silva beat countryman Benjamin Paredes, after
making a wrong turn just before the park
	   The early part of the race did not go as quickly as expected,
with the scheduled pace-setters failing to do their job. Instead,
the first half was very tactical.
	   After that, the pace picked up, and two of the dropouts along
the second half were 1996 Olympic champion Josia Thugwane of South
Africa and 1997 world champion Abel Anton of Spain. At the same
time, Kenyans took control _ after 18 miles (29 kilometers), the
first five runners were from Kenya.
	   But as the race developed, it boiled down to a three-man contest
among Kagwe, Chebet and Bayo as the runners approached the finish
in Central Park.
	   The weather at the start of the race was perfect for marathoners
_ 50 F (10 C), with 61 percent humidity and a 6 mph (10 kph) wind _
as well as spectators, with an estimated 2 million lining the
streets of the city's five boroughs.
	   Kagwe collected the dlrs 50,000 first prize.

Gazza returns for Boro in tie with Forest
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Paul Gascoigne returned after 16 days in an
alcohol rehab clinic to help Middlesbrough regain fourth place in
the Premier League Sunday in a 1-1 tie with struggling Nottingham
Forest.
	   Showing few of the dribbling, shooting and passing skills that
marked his career with Newcastle, Tottenham, Lazio and Glasgow
Rangers, Gascoigne tackled strongly and was shown the yellow card
for a clattering into the legs of Forest's Scott Gemmill before he
was taken off 13 minutes from the end.
	   ``It's good to be back,'' said Gascoigne, who had not played
since the middle of last month when he checked into a clinic to
sort out his heavy drinking problems.
	   ``I've worked hard to do a few things while I was at the clinic
but I need a few games to get my fitness back. I'm going to go back
to the clinic two times a week.
	   ``I've got to go out and keep playing football and don't
drink.''
	   By the time Gascoigne left the game, Middlesbrough was leading
thanks to Brian Deane's first goal for the club in the 22nd minute.
	   But Forest looked far more impressive in the second half and
deserved its leveller three minutes from the end with Marlon
Harewood shooting through the fingertips of Boro 'keeper Marlon
Beresford.
	   Harewood should have snatched the winner a minute later,
breaking clear of the Forest defense with only the 'keeper to beat
but Beresford managing to stretch and block his 20-meter lob.
	   The point enabled Bryan Robson's Middlesbrough to regain fourth
place from Liverpool but Forest stayed second from from last above
only Coventry and Southampton.
	   Aston Villa remains a point clear in the Premier League even
though its game at Chelsea was postoned because the Stamford Bridge
field was waterlogged.
	   Manchester United gained a 4-1 win at Everton Saturday to stay
second and cut the lead to one point while defending titlist
Arsenal won 1-0 at Coventry to remain third and two points behind
the leader.
	   In Division One, Sunderland marched back to first place with a
3-0 win at Bolton Sunday.
	   Goals by Scottish international Allan Johnston, Niall Quinn and
Michael Bridges means that Peter Reid's unbeaten team has a
two-point lead over Birmingham and has two games in hand.
	   Birmingham moved temporarily to the top on Saturday by tying 1-1
with Huddersfield.

<TEXT>
	   Excerpts from a statement faxed to news organizations Sunday and
signed by Izzedine al Qassam, the military wing of the radical
Islamic group Hamas:
	   Our holy war will never stop whatever the challenges. ... We are
as steadfast as mountains and we will never be scapegoats for the
black agreement ...
	   Bit by bit, day after day, the Palestinian Authority proves its
loyalty to the Zionists and enemies of the nation and its
relinquishing of the rights of our steadfast people ...
	   There is no doubt that (Palestinian leader Yasser) Arafat and
his repressive security apparatus have reached the point of treason
and utter loyalty to Israel. ... Those who got carried away by
false hopes and empty dreams of crushing Hamas and its military
wing ... do not know Hamas ...
	   The information we have ... of the collaboration between the
(Palestinian Authority's) security apparatus and the Zionist ones
under the supervision of the CIA in order to assassinate and
eliminate the hero, the fighter and the leader, Mohammed Deif, like
the assassination of (chief Hamas bombmaker) Mohiyedine Sharif,
(Hamas fugitives) Adel and Imad Awadallah would not go unpunished.
	   We stress that the fire of revenge and the volcano of justice
will reach all the conspirators, whatever their nationalities or
positions ...
	   Anyone who allows himself to plan or conspire against the hero
Deif or any of our holy warriors will pay a high price ... There is
no room for self-control or silence any more. ...
	   All the security and political agreements signed to crush Hamas
and the Qassam brigades, and all the massive security and
intelligence efforts carried out to please the Zionists and
Americans, will never obstruct our holy war ... or put an end to
our distinctive suicide operations on any spot in our violated
land. ...
	   Despite all what the (Palestinian Authority) and its security
apparatus have done to our sons and fighters, we still extend our
hands to the Authority ... to spare our people the horrors of ...
civil war. This will not take place unless repression ... against
Hamas has been stopped.
	   If they don't, the Authority ... will bear the full
responsibility before our people, our nations and before history
for any ... dangerous repercussions. ...
	   We call on our Arab leaders and brothers, the leaders of Arab
and Islamic countries, the Arab League and the Organization of
Islamic Conference to ... exert pressures on the Palestinian
Authority to lift the house arrest of Sheik Ahmed Yassin and stop
their wide-ranging campaign aimed at liquidating Hamas, before the
situation become complicated and before the Palestinians face an
explosion that cannot be stopped ...

Monty finishes top again as Clarke wins final event
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: clarifies Monty's final earnings &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JEREZ, Spain (AP) _ Colin Montgomerie finished top of the
European PGA Tour money list for an unprecedented sixth year in a
row Sunday after a third place finish at the Volvo Masters, which
was won by Northern Ireland's Darren Clarke with a 9-under 63.
	   Starting the final round one stroke behind his main rival and
joint tournament leader Lee Westwood, Montgomerie carded a 4-under
68 at the Montecastillo course. That gave him a 14-under total of
274 to finish behind Clarke and fellow Scot Andrew Coltart while
Westwood's 75 meant his challenge fell apart.
	   ``All I can say is that it's getting tougher,'' Montgomerie said
after his third place finish lifted his total for the year to
993,077 pounds (dlrs 1.66 million). That figure included a bonus of
170,000 pounds (dlrs 284,000) for finishing top of the earnings
list.
	   ``Everyone else is improving all the time and I have had to go
along with that, otherwise I would have been overtaken.''
	   While Montgomerie made few mistakes all day, collecting five
birdies against a bogey 5 at the 15th, it was all over for Westwood
when he twice drove out of bounds from the tee at the 172-yard 14th
and made a quadruple bogey seven. He finished with a 75 for a
four-round total of 280 and a share of 12th.
	   ``I played poorly. I struggled all day,'' said the Englishman,
who drove into a bunker for a bogey at the second and collected
only one birdie in the first 11 holes.
	   ``My chances had gone even by the 14th. It was the start of my
round that let me down. After that I never really had a chance.''
	   Clarke, the only other player capable of overtaking Montgomerie
and Westwood on the money list, made a course record-equalling
9-under 63 in the final round for a 17-under total of 271.
	   He birdied four of the first five holes, eagled the 517-yard
par-5 ninth and added three more birdies on the way home. The burly
Northern Ireland player took home the first prize of 166,000 pounds
(dlrs 277,220) and wound up second in the overall money list behind
Monty and ahead of Westwood.
	   ``Darren Clarke put the pressure on me right away when he eagled
the 9th to go 14 under,'' Montgomerie said. ``It was his tournament
from then on.''
	   Coltart finished runner up in the tournament after a 66 left him
two strokes behind, squandering his chance by three-putting the
third and missing a birdie chance at the last.
	   To finish top, Clarke had to win the championship and hope that
Montgomerie finished ninth or lower with Westwood not in the top
three.
	   With bonus money added for finishing second on the list,
Clarke's victory meant he earned a total of 286,000 pounds (dlrs
477,600) to take his season's total to 902,687 (dlrs 1.51 million).

New anti-Catholic gang claims responsibility for latest killing
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES grafs 5-7 with reaction, trims pvs &QL; 
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ A new Protestant gang opposed
to Northern Ireland's prevailing cease-fires claimed responsibility
Sunday for killing a Catholic civilian.
	   A caller representing the Red Hand Defenders told the British
Broadcasting Corp.'s office in Londonderry that the group shot
35-year-old Brian Service as he walked home alone early Saturday on
Belfast's rough north side. The caller also claimed responsibility
for another gun attack on a pub in Catholic west Belfast in which
nobody was hurt.
	   The killing demonstrates a new dissident threat within the ranks
of Northern Ireland's outlawed pro-British groups: the Ulster
Defense Association, Ulster Volunteer Force and Red Hand Commando,
which have observed a joint cease-fire since 1994, and the Loyalist
Volunteer Force, which joined the truce after politicians struck a
historic peace accord in April.
	   Such groups have killed more than 900 people, mostly Catholic
civilians at random, in a three-decade campaign designed to match
violence committed by the Irish Republican Army. The IRA, the major
anti-British paramilitary group with power bases in working-class
Catholic areas, has observed a truce for 15 months.
	   ``Once again the cowardly men of violence have stepped from the
shadows, and murdered a man in his prime of life,'' David Trimble
and Seamus Mallon, elected to be the respective Protestant and
Catholic leaders of the new government, said in a joint statement.
	   ``We must ensure that this dreadful murder is not used as an
excuse for any further outrage,'' they added.
	   And David Ervine, a former Ulster Volunteer Force commander now
committed to compromise, condemned Service's killers as
``fascists'' who were trying to overturn public support for the
peace accord.
	   Saturday's killing coincided with the failure to meet an
important deadline in the accord, which a strong minority of
Protestants think gives too much to the IRA and its allied Sinn
Fein party.
	   The agreement, supported by eight parties after 22 months of
negotiations, called for a new Northern Ireland government to hold
an inaugural summit with the Irish government by the end of
October. But that symbolically important development has been
delayed because Trimble is refusing to include Sinn Fein in the new
government unless the IRA starts disarming.
	   The accord called for both the IRA and outlawed pro-British
groups to disarm by mid-2000, but didn't specify a starting point.
Both camps have vowed to retain their weaponry indefinitely.
	   The name ``Red Hand Defenders'' emerged this summer in
Portadown, Northern Ireland's most staunchly Protestant town, where
an annual confrontation between Protestant marchers and Catholic
protesters has triggered widespread violence.
	   After police blocked this year's march, the Red Hand Defenders
issued death threats against leading Catholic protesters and
claimed responsibility killing a police offer in a grenade attack.
	   Police and politicians suspect that the Red Hand Defenders is a
cover name for dissident members of the Loyalist Volunteer Force,
which killed a dozen Catholics this year and called a cease-fire in
May.
	   A red-colored hand is the traditional symbol of the province of
Ulster and today features on many Protestant flags and murals.

 &UR; Kagwe, Fiacconi win New York City Marathon &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with women's winner &QL; 
 &UR; By BERT ROSENTHAL &QC; 
 &UR; AP Track Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ A powerful John Kagwe ran away from Kenyan
countryman Joseph Chebet in the final yards (meters) Sunday and won
the New York City Marathon for the second straight year in the
second-closest finish in the race's 29-year history.
	   Kagwe, Chebet and Tanzania's Zebedayo Bayo turned into Central
Park almost even, but Bayo couldn't keep pace and fell behind. Then
it was a battle between Kagwe and Chebet, also the 1-2 finishers
last year.
	   Kagwe's winning time was 2 hours, 8 minutes, 45 seconds. Chebet
finished three seconds back and Bayo was third at 2:08:51.
	   The closest finish in the history of this race was two seconds,
in 1994 when Mexico's German Silva beat countryman Benjamin
Paredes.
	   Franca Fiacconi became the first Italian to win the women's
division of the NYC Marathon. She outdueled world record-holder and
two-time New York champion Tegla Loroupe of Kenya over the closing
miles (kilometers).
	   Fiacconi, third last year and second in 1996, was timed in
2:25:17. Adriana Fernandez of Mexico also passed the ailing Loroupe
and finished second, at 2:26:33. Loroupe, bothered by stomach
cramps, wound up third at 2:30:26.
	   The jubilant Fiacconi gave the thumbs-up sign twice shortly
before the end, then bent and kissed the ground after crossing the
finish line.
	   For the men, the stronger Kagwe proved too good for Chebet, who
was frustrated for the third straight time _ he also finished
runner-up to compatriot Moses Tanui in Boston in April.
	   The early part of the race did not go as quickly as expected,
with the scheduled pace-setters failing to do their job. Instead,
the first half was very tactical.
	   After that, the pace picked up and two of the dropouts along the
second half were 1996 Olympic champion Josia Thugwane of South
Africa and 1997 world champion Abel Anton of Spain. At the same
time, Kenyans took control _ after 18 miles (29 kilometers) the
first five runners were from Kenya.
	   But as the race developed, it boiled down to a three-man contest
among Kagwe, Chebet and Bayo as the runners approached the finish
in Central Park.
	   The weather at the start of the race was perfect for marathoners
_ 50 F (10 C), 61 percent humidity, 6 mph (10 kph) wind _ as well
as spectators, with an estimated 2 million lining the streets of
the city's five boroughs.
	   Kagwe and Fiacconi each collected dlrs 50,000 for winning.

Stanislav Zhuk, renowned _ if controversial _ skating coach, dies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Stanislav Zhuk, a renowned and controversial
Russian figure skating coach whose students included many of
Russia's best-known skaters, died Sunday of undisclosed causes, a
news agency said. He was 63.
	   A highly successful skater himself, Zhuk was best known for
teaching pairs in the Soviet Union. Although his success spoke for
itself, his methods were not universally admired, and he left a
legacy of bitterness among some of his skaters.
	   In her book, ``My Sergei _ A Love Story,'' about her life with
partner Sergei Grinkov, skater Ekaterina Gordeeva described Zhuk as
a hard-drinking, abusive coach who routinely spied on his students
and kicked out girls who wouldn't sleep with him.
	   She also described him as a tough taskmaster.
	   ``Zhuk always took us to places that had stairs,'' she wrote.
``The longest was 225 steps; another had 175 steps. Sometimes he
made us not run, but jump up the stairs, first with one leg and
then with the other.''
	   Zhuk burst onto the skating scene in the 1960s with his wife and
skating partner, Nina. They finished sixth sixth at the Winter
Olympics at Squaw Valley, Calif., in 1960, and as high as second in
later European championships.
	   Later, after becoming a coach for the Central Army Sports Club,
he coached pairs figure skating at a time when the Soviet Union
dominated the sport, and had a virtual lock on the Olympic gold
medal.
	   His skating pairs included the gold medalists Irina Rodnina and
Alexander Zaitzev, and Gordeyeva and Grinkov.
	   In recent years, he had been the senior coach of the Russian
national team. He and Nina Zhuk, also a coach, were divorced.
	   The report on his death, by the ITAR-Tass news agency, did not
say where he died.

Ominous milestone on peace road: first Hamas threat against Arafat
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Recasts, INCORPORATING Palestinian-Hamas, changes byline,
overline. &QL; 
 &UR; With Israel-Rabin. &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos NY192, JRL104-105 &QL; 
 &UR; By LAURA KING &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The military arm of the radical Islamic group
Hamas made an unprecedented threat Sunday against Yasser Arafat,
demanding that the Palestinian leader halt a crackdown against it
or face violent vengeance.
	   The threat, in a leaflet faxed to news organizations, cast a
pall over this week's efforts to begin implementing the
Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement, but as of Sunday, both sides
were still pledging to move ahead as scheduled.
	   In recent days, Arafat's security forces have rounded up more
than 100 Hamas activists, detained some of its top political
leaders and put its ailing, charismatic founder, Sheik Ahmed
Yassin, under house arrest.
	   That crackdown _ and the Hamas demand to halt it _ marked a
spectacular smashup of the uneasy peace that had prevailed between
Arafat and Hamas over the past 14 months, ever since Yassin was
released from Israeli prison and returned to his faithful following
in the Gaza Strip.
	   Until now, in deference to Arafat's enduring role as a symbol of
Palestinian unity, Hamas had stopped short of direct threats
against him. But the leaflet _ signed by Hamas' Izzedine al Qassam
brigades _ specifically accused the Palestinian leader by name of
having ``reached the point of treason'' by moving against Hamas.
	   It called for an immediate end to the crackdown in order to
spare Palestinians ``the horrors ... of civil war'' and Arafat's
camp the ``fires of revenge.''
	   With so many Hamas officials in jail, few were available to
vouch for the leaflet's authenticity, and none wanted to do so
publicly. But its language, style and phrasing were markedly
similar to past communications from Hamas' military wing.
	   One Palestinian government official _ Imad Falouji, the
communications minister and a former Hamas member _ said he doubted
the threats were real. Falouji, however, has been trying to act as
a mediator between Arafat and Yassin.
	   Palestinian security officials took the warnings seriously _ and
issued some of their own in response.
	   ``We have only one authority in this land, which is the
Palestinian Authority,'' said Palestinian police commander Ghazi
Jabali. ``We are going to take all measures to control the
situation.''
	   The leaflet denounced the house arrest of Yassin, whom it called
``the prince of holy warriors'' and warned Palestinian security
forces against pursuing Mohammed Deif, a top leader of Hamas'
military wing whose arrest has been demanded by Israel.
	   Strong steps by Arafat against Islamic militants are a key
provision of the Washington pact, which the leaflet referred to as
the ``black agreement.''
	   Under the accord, Palestinians are to undertake a series of
security-related measures in exchange for a handover of another
13.1 percent of the West Bank by Israel.
	   The Palestinian side said it would deliver a promised security
document to the Americans on Monday, and the Israeli Cabinet is to
begin discussing the accord on Tuesday and vote then or Wednesday.
	   Meanwhile, extremists on both sides _ hard-line Jewish settlers
on the one side, Hamas on the other _ have been trying hard to
derail the accord.
	   On Sunday, without any interference from Israeli authorities,
Jewish settlers built a fence on a disputed plot of land in
traditionally Arab east Jerusalem, infuriating the Palestinians.
	   Hamas, for its part, tried last week to blow up a school bus
carrying Jewish schoolchildren in the Gaza Strip. The children were
unharmed but an Israeli soldier was killed.
	   Already shaken by that attack, Israel saw the threats against
the Palestinian Authority as a potentially worrisome new
complication.
	   David Bar-Illan, a top aide to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, said he did not know if the leaflet was authentic, but
that Hamas' military wing ``has been allowed to grow and to expand
to such an extent that it probably does now pose a real danger.''
	   In recent months, Yassin's rivalry with Arafat has grown more
and more pronounced. Earlier this year, the sheik made a
high-profile fund-raising tour of Muslim nations during which he
harshly criticized Arafat and worked to drum up support for Hamas.
	   In what may be a bid to cash in on that political capital, the
leaflet called on Arab leaders to pressure Arafat to halt the
crackdown. Several Arab countries have already spoken out against
the Washington accord, and Iran denounced Arafat for entering into
it.
	   Despite a slippage in Arafat's popularity, polls consistently
indicate fewer than one in five Palestinians supports Hamas. But if
smaller, Yassin's following is more fervent.
	   There are no reliable figures on the number of active Hamas
operatives, but tactics like those it has used against Israel _
bombings and guerrilla-style attacks _ would be difficult to
counteract, even with the full weight of Arafat's 40,000-member
security force.

Police seize 26 kilograms heroin
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Police seized 26 kilograms (57.2 pounds)
of heroin, customs officials announced Sunday.
	   The seizure was made at the Ruse crossing on the
Bulgarian-Romanian border, some 320 kilometer (200 miles) northeast
of Sofia.
	   Customs officers found the heroin in a container welded to the
floor of a Citroen car driven by a Yugoslav citizen.
	   The Yugoslav had two passports and his identity has not yet been
established, police officials said.
	   He could face up to 15 years' imprisonment if found guilty of
drug smuggling.
	   Drug smuggling has increased in Bulgaria and across the former
Soviet bloc since border restrictions eased after the collapse of
communism in 1989.
	   Favorite routes run from Turkey across Bulgaria, Romania and
Macedonia to western Europe.

 &UR; Mubarak: Israel must create atmosphere of trust with Syria &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Mubarak comments, FIXES slug &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SHARM EL-SHEIK, Egypt (AP) _ President Hosni Mubarak said Sunday
that Israel should create an atmosphere of trust with Syria for
peace talks to restart.
	   ``The Syrians ... have no trust (in Israel),'' Mubarak said
after meeting with Syrian President Hafez Assad.
	   ``Israel must prepare an atmosphere in which there will be trust
between all the parties ... or the situation will be difficult,''
he added.
	   Syrian-Israeli talks have been stalled since early 1996. Syria
contends that it reached a secret deal with the previous Israeli
government under which it agreed to withdraw from the Golan
Heights, which Israel seized from Syria in the 1967 Middle East
War.
	   Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that the Golan
Heights are vital to Israel's security and his government is not
bound by agreements made under the previous government.
	   The meeting between Mubarak and Assad comes a little over one
week after Israel and the Palestinian Authority signed an accord
calling for an Israeli withdrawal from an additional 13 percent of
the West Bank in exchange for a security crackdown on militants.
	   Assad also briefed Mubarak on the latest developments between
Syria and Turkey.
	   Egypt mediated an agreement between the two countries last month
that averted a possible conflict.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu laid a wreath
at a graveside memorial ceremony Sunday in solemn tribute to
Yitzhak Rabin, three years after the Israeli leader's
assassination.
	   Several demonstrators at Jerusalem's Mount Herzl cemetery
heckled Netanyahu and shouted, ``Murderer! Murderer!'' during the
ceremony, attended by politicians, Rabin's family and dignitaries.
	   Those in attendance laid flowers and stones at the grave, a
Jewish tradition.
	   None of the hecklers approached Netanyahu, but their shouts
clearly disturbed the somber ceremony. Police spokeswoman Linda
Menuhin said five people were arrested.
	   On November 4, 1995, as he was leaving a peace rally in Tel
Aviv, Rabin was shot and killed by a Jewish ultranationalist bent
on stopping Rabin's land-for-peace policies with the Palestinians.
	   Netanyahu, leader of the opposition when Rabin was prime
minister, was blamed by both Rabin's family and members of the
left-wing Labor party for contributing to the violent political
atmosphere leading up to the assassination.
	   On the third anniversary of Rabin's death according to the
Jewish calendar, Netanyahu opened his weekly Cabinet meeting with a
minute of silence and Israel's parliament held a special session in
memory of the former Israeli premier, defense minister and war
hero.
	   Speaking in Israel's Knesset, Netanyahu said that while he
disagreed with Rabin's policies, he aimed to achieve a peace that
would unify Israelis.
	   ``We are one people, with one fate, with one hope in one
country. I pray that we can extend hands to each other and together
put out the flame of hate,'' Netanyahu said. ``Peace is made first
between brothers.''
	   Saturday in Tel Aviv, about 300,000 Israelis jammed the square
where Rabin was killed, and stood shoulder-to-shoulder to voice
support for the Israeli-Palestinian peace process that he began.
	   On Sunday, hundreds more stopped by a permanent memorial at the
square now named for Rabin to light candles and write messages of
peace.
	   Israeli flags were lowered to half-staff on government buildings
and at army bases.
	   At many Israeli schools, students gathered for memorial
ceremonies and discussions about the assassination. Radio and
television channels broadcast documentaries and discussions about
Rabin's life and his violent death.
	   Israel's government decreed an annual memorial day for the only
Israeli leader to be assassinated, but did not declare it a work or
government holiday.
	   President Ezer Weizman lit a memorial candle at his official
residence, beginning the day of remembrance. Weizman warned that
the lessons of Rabin's assassination had not been learned.
	   ``Could it happen again?'' asked the Israeli president, a
retired Air Force commander and veteran peace activist now in a
largely ceremonial role. ``I regret to say that lately there are
signs that the answer is not necessarily a no.''
	   Since Netanyahu signed a recent peace agreement with Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat, in which Israel will turn over another 13.1
percent of the West Bank to the Palestinians, there have been
violent demonstrations against the government, recalling some of
the protests before Rabin was killed.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu laid a wreath
at a graveside memorial ceremony as Israel paid solemn tribute
Sunday to Yitzhak Rabin, three years after his assassination.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton said in an interview to Israel's
Channel 2 TV that it was still difficult for him to talk about
Rabin's death even now.
	   ``I must say for me that was more than a political loss. I felt
very close to the prime minister, to Mrs. Rabin, I got to know
their children. grandchildren,'' Clinton said.
	   Recalling his close friendship to the Israeli leader, Clinton
said ``I think always when I'm pushing the peace process forward
that I'm doing it not just for myself but also a little for him.''

Modernizer premier gambles with confidence vote
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with opening remarks premier, opposition. No pickup &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) - Opening a long parliamentary debate before
his government faces a confidence vote, Premier Costas Simitis
promised Sunday to intensify painful economic reforms that have led
to labor protests and deep rifts in the governing Socialist party.
	   ``Our government is determined to press ahead,'' Simitis told
lawmakers. ``We are not prepared to jettison the efforts made by
the Greek people which have achieved so much. Our message is clear:
not one step backwards and no compromises on the road to making
Greece strong.''
	   Simitis requested the vote last week after carrying out a
limited reshuffle of his cabinet. The government is not considered
in danger of falling when the vote is taken by the 300-seat
parliament, where the Socialists have a comfortable majority.
	   But the debate will give conservative and leftist opposition
parties an opportunity to publicly hammer the government. The
roll-call vote is expected late Tuesday.
	   The Socialists were stung by defeats in municipal elections
earlier this month. They are also dogged by chronic dissent from
deputies opposed to Simitis' economic austerity measures aimed at
earning Greece a spot in the European Union's single currency
group.
	   The conservative opposition leader, Costas Caramanlis, said the
elections had displayed popular discontent with Simitis. ``With
this vote of confidence, Mr. Simitis is attempting to put on a show
of strength towards his party but he is displaying how weakened he
has become,'' Caramanlis told parliament. ``He is panicking.''
	   Midway through his four-year term in office, the 62-year-old
Simitis says he is determined to redouble efforts to streamline the
bloated public sector. And he has promised not to stray a
``millimeter'' from economic policies designed to earn the EU's
poorest country a place in the single currency club.
	   Greece is the only country of the 15-member EU which failed to
qualify for the first round of monetary Union. Britain, Denmark and
Sweden opted out of joining.
	   ``Greeks will have one of the strongest currencies in the world
in their pocket,'' Simitis said Sunday. ``We can either jump
forward or remain on the sidelines.''
	   Simitis needs at least 151 votes from the unicameral parliament
to survive. All 160 Socialist deputies and three expelled from the
party last year are predicted to support the government. All
opposition deputies will likely vote against the motion.
	   Socialist dissenters have been warned they risk expulsion from
the party if they vote against the government.

U.S. official says fear still hindering return of refugees
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Kosovo Albanian guerrillas reportedly firing on
Serb police &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos available
 &UR; By TOM COHEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ethnic Albanian rebels opened fire
Sunday on a police patrol in western Kosovo, wounding one
policeman, Serb sources said. A senior U.S. official complained
that fear of the police is delaying efforts to return refugees to
their homes.
	   The government-run Serb Media Center said the attack took place
early Sunday afternoon, when four Kosovo Liberation Army guerrillas
opened fire on a police patrol near Glodjane, 65 kilometers (40
miles) west of here.
	   Serb policemen returned fire, the center said, but there was no
word on rebel casualties. The report could not be independently
confirmed, and there was no comment from ethnic Albanian sources.
	   American and European diplomats have appealed to the ethnic
Albanian separatists to honor the Oct. 12 peace agreement between
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and U.S. envoy Richard
Holbrooke.
	   International envoys fear that continued violence will undermine
their efforts to encourage tens of thousands of ethnic Albanian
refugees to return to homes they fled after Milosevic launched a
crackdown on KLA militants Feb. 28.
	   That in turn could lead to a humanitarian disaster when the
bitter Balkan winter sets in.
	   Despite weeks of relative peace in Kosovo, U.S. Assistant
Secretary of State Julia Taft said fear of Serb police and soldiers
continues to prevent thousands of refugees from returning home,
although significant progress has occurred in implementing the
Kosovo peace deal.
	   After visiting two villages and meeting with a range of relief
officials, Taft said conditions in the war-torn province were much
better than during her previous visit two months ago.
	   While many of the 50,000 or more refugees who had been living in
the woods have returned to villages, some still were staying away
from their homes, she said.
	   ``It's difficult to say that everybody is able to go back home
or is willing to go back home,'' Taft told a news conference.
``There is fear among the population.''
	   She saw that fear firsthand earlier, during a visit to an ethnic
Albanian compound in the foothills south of Pec, 100 kilometers (60
miles) west of Pristina.
	   Family members complained that Serb police harass them, arrest
people and make them feel unsafe despite the Oct. 12 agreement.
	   They said only international troops, not the unarmed foreign
verification force being created, could solve their problem.
	   ``The Westerners are not going to solve the problem,'' Taft told
the family. ``The people who live here must come to an agreement to
solve their problem.''
	   But the head of the family, who asked that his name not be used
because he feared retribution by Serb police, told her: ``I don't
think that it will be possible.''
	   Taft later said Serb police had decreased their visibility,
noting she passed only three checkpoints during her travels Sunday,
compared to the dozens that used to exist.
	   Acknowledging that even a small police presence concerned
residents, she called the creation of a civilian police force in
Kosovo a ``high priority'' for the international community.
	   ``My sense is that until there is a credible civilian police
presence in the villages and towns, you won't have the confidence
necessary'' for people to resume their normal lives, Taft said.
	   She also expressed concern for reports that Serb police and
ethnic Albanian guerrillas were detaining people.
	   Also Sunday, the KLA said its self-styled ``military court''
sentenced two Serbian journalists two weeks ago to 60 days
imprisonment.
	   Despite protests by Red Cross and others, the KLA has rejected
freeing them or allowing visits by international representatives.
	   Western powers led by the United States threatened NATO
airstrikes to force Milosevic to reach the agreement that calls for
him to withdraw police and military forces to levels before the
February crackdown.
	   The agreement also provides for full access for relief agencies
and a 2,000-member unarmed ``ground verification mission'' that
will verify compliance with the deal.
	   NATO spy planes also will overfly the country, and a
rapid-reaction force is to be set up in neighboring Macedonia. In
Italy, U.S. Navy spokesman Capt. Steve Burnett said Navy P-3C
Orions would begin regular surveillance flights over Kosovo this
week.
	   Taft said the ground verification mission, being set up by the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, would have an
``intrusive'' presence in Kosovo to make sure Serb forces comply.
	   Yugoslavia's defense minister said he expects no trouble with
the coming international peace mission, but he warned against
possible provocations by ethnic Albanians.
	   Pavle Bulatovic, in an interview to Belgrade-based BK television
late Saturday, said the Yugoslav army will cooperate fully with the
Milosevic-Holbrooke agreement.
	   ``The only thing we can be afraid of is that terrorists can make
a provocation harmful for the OSCE representatives,'' he said,
referring to the guerrilla army.

Police forensic report says no torture in southern village
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Mubarak comments

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Allegations that 15 Coptic Christians were
tortured by police during reported mass arrests are unfounded, said
a forensic report by police doctors released Sunday.
	   The report was part of the government's investigation into
charges that police in the southern village of El-Kusheh arrested
hundreds of people over a period of three weeks, torturing and
threatening many with rape in their search for a murderer.
	   The allegations, carried widely by the foreign media, were a
political embarrassment for Egypt, which insists that minority
Orthodox Christians are not subjected to discrimination.
	   Egyptian human rights groups claimed that hundreds were arrested
and many tortured. Human rights officials said this was not because
they were Christians, but because torture is part of ordinary
police practice in Egypt.
	   President Hosni Mubarak on Sunday said that Israel may have been
behind the media reports as part of a move to discredit Egypt,
which has given lukewarm support to the peace accord that Israel
and the Palestinians signed last month.
	   ``Whenever something happens (Israel) pushes someone against
us,'' he said.
	   The incident was mentioned in a report issued by Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office before it was reported in
influential British newspapers, Mubarak said.
	   Mubarak denied reports of police torture.
	   Such acts ``occurred in centuries before the birth of Christ,
but not now,'' he said.

Yeltsin has no planned meetings in next few days
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: INSERTS 2 grafs after 3rd graf to UPDATE with Sysuyev saying
Yeltsin's political role to grow. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin, on vacation in southern
Russia following his latest bout of ill health, will not hold any
meetings in the next few days, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported
Sunday.
	   Yeltsin arrived Friday at the resort of Sochi for a two-week
stay to rest on the orders of his doctors. Reportedly suffering
extreme fatigue and high blood pressure, he handed over many of his
responsibilities to Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov last week.
	   Yeltsin has been plagued by health problems in recent years,
prompting speculation that he is not capable of fulfilling his
duties or serving out the remainder of his term, which expires in
2000. The opposition repeated calls last week for Yeltsin to
resign, but the president repeatedly has said he will never step
down.
	   His deputy chief of staff, Oleg Sysuyev, insisted on national
television Sunday that while Yeltsin is relinquishing authority
over the economy, his political role ``will only be mounting in the
time before 2000.''
	   Speaking on the influential program ``Itogi,'' Sysuyev said
Yeltsin would take control of constitutional reform initiatives,
and would play a key role in the 2000 elections _ but not as a
candidate.
	   Yeltsin did take time Sunday to congratulate the Kultura
television channel on its first anniversary of operations. He
signed a decree last year establishing the channel, which devotes
itself only to cultural programming.
	   ``The contribution of the channel Kultura in saving the rich
tradition of our fatherland's cultural legacy is difficult to
overestimate,'' Yeltsin wrote in the statement.

Hezbollah chief calls for killing Israelis to scuttle peace deal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HUSSEIN DAKROUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ The leader of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah
called on Palestinians Sunday to kill Israelis to scuttle the
U.S.-brokered peace accord with Israel.
	   Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, secretary-general of the Hezbollah
guerrilla group, also urged Palestinians to chop off the hand of
their leader, Yasser Arafat, for signing the deal.
	   ``The agreement calls for ensuring security and peace for the
Israelis. This agreement should be destroyed. This can be done by
killing Israeli soldiers and Israeli settlers,'' Nasrallah told a
rally in Beirut's southern suburbs, a Hezbollah stronghold.
	   ``Destroying the ... agreements doesn't need warplanes, tanks or
long-range missiles or even nuclear weapons,'' he said amid chants
of ``Death to Israel.''
	   ``The people of Palestine are capable of destroying this
treacherous agreement with knives,'' he said.
	   It was Nasrallah's first public comment on the peace accord
signed in Washington Oct. 23 by Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   The rally was organized by Hezbollah to protest the accord,
which calls for an Israeli withdrawal from an additional 13 percent
of the West Bank in exchange for a Palestinian security crackdown
on Islamic militants.
	   Hezbollah is leading a guerrilla war to oust Israeli troops and
allied Lebanese militiamen from a border enclave in southern
Lebanon.
	   Many Arab commentators and hard-line Palestinian groups have
criticized the deal as a sellout of Palestinian aspirations.
	   ``Today, a traitor in the name of Palestine comes to give away
the land of Palestine to the killer and criminal Zionists. This
(Arafat's) hand should be severed by the Palestinian people,''
Nasrallah said.

<TEXT>
	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ The leaders of Guinea-Bissau's warring
sides met behind closed doors Sunday for a third day in a bid to
resolve the West African country's bitter five-month civil war.
	   The talks between President Joao Bernardo Vieira and Brig.
Ansumane Mane were veiled in secrecy at the mansion of Nigeria's
military leader, Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar.
	   The antagonists met with a committee of West African leaders
from nine countries including Abubakar throughout the day and
evening Saturday and Sunday, a government official said on
condition of anonymity.
	   It was not clear how long the talks would last, although the
official said he expected the participants to remain in Nigeria's
capital on Monday for more meetings.
	   One of the mediators, Togo's President Gnassigbe Eyadema, told
journalists on Saturday that both Vieira and Mane had pledged to
remain at the table until they hashed out a deal.

<SLUG> BC-Portugal-East Timor Resistance leader reports Indonesian attack </SLUG>

against East Timor rebels
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Some 2,000 Indonesian troops supported
by helicopters launched an attack on rebels inside East Timor, an
East Timorese resistance leader said Sunday.
	   The attack took place Friday near Los Palos on the eastern side
of the disputed territory, East Timorese leader and Nobel Peace
Prize laureate Jose Ramos Horta said.
	   Ramos Horta said he learned of the attack through resistance
sources in the Indonesian capital Jakarta who were informed by a
guerrilla commander inside East Timor. He said he lacked
information regarding the number of casualties.
	   ``Indonesia has once again ignored (President B.J.) Habibie's
promises, and the appeals of the U.N. Secretary-General,'' Ramos
Horta said by phone from a meeting of East Timorese activists in
Krumbach, Austria.
	   News reports last week said Habibie had failed to fulfill his
pledge to scale down Indonesia's military presence in the
half-island territory.
	   The number of Indonesian troops in East Timor reportedly was
more than 20,000, far more than the number claimed by the
Indonesian government.
	   Also Sunday the pro-independence Socialist Party of Timor said
Indonesia had deployed four battalions near Los Palos.
	   The party also reported fighting in the area since Friday in its
statement distributed in Lisbon.
	   Indonesia invaded East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, in
1975 and annexed it a year later. The United Nations does not
recognize Indonesian rule and is sponsoring peace talks between
Indonesia and Portugal.

Ajax recaptures its sharpness
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Ajax Amsterdam warmed up for
Wednesday's Champions League clash with Olympiakos of Greece by
trouncing NEC Nijmegen 4-0 Sunday.
	   Ajax (7-2-2) drew level with Feyenoord at the top of the league
with 23 points, but the Rotterdammers have played a game less.
	   Ajax has scored 13 goals and conceded just one in winning its
last three games, and now has the league's best defensive and
offensive records.
	   Finn Jari Litmanen and Georgian Shota Arveladze had time to miss
golden chances before the floodlights failed in the 16th minute
causing a half-hour delay.
	   But the pair made amends soon after the restart, Litmanen with a
sharp headed goal from Ronald de Boer's center and Arveladze with a
typical striker's goal when the ball dropped loose close to goal.
	   Jack de Gier made things worse for NEC on 39 minutes when he was
sent off for a wild two-footed tackle.
	   Just as NEC was coming back into the game, Peter Hoekstra broke
on the left and pulled the ball back for Brazilian Wamberto to
score from 10 meters (yards). Then Arveladze set up Richard
Witschge for the fourth.
	   But with the game won, holes opened up in the Ajax defense, with
the inexperienced Arno Splinter at its heart, and Edwin van der Sar
had to prove his great class as a keeper with a string of saves.
	   Changing managers didn't help winless bottom club RKC Waalwijk
this week. It sacked Peter Boeve Monday after the club's seventh
defeat and appointed ex-Roda JC boss Martin Jol.
	   But a last-minute own-goal from defender Michel van Zundert
prolonged its losing streak Sunday. RKC lost 2-1 at home to De
Graafschap Doetinchem.
	   The day's other game saw Roda win 3-0 at FC Utrecht.

East Timorese resistance leader said Sunday.
	   The attack took place Friday near Los Palos on the eastern side
of the disputed territory, East Timorese leader and Nobel Peace
Prize laureate Jose Ramos Horta said.
	   Ramos Horta said he learned of the attack through resistance
sources in the Indonesian capital Jakarta, who were informed by a
guerrilla commander inside East Timor. He said he lacked
information regarding the number of casualties.
	   ``Indonesia has once again ignored (President B.J.) Habibie's
promises, and the appeals of the U.N. Secretary-General,'' Ramos
Horta said by phone from a meeting of East Timorese activists in
Krumbach, Austria.
	   Indonesia invaded East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, in
1975 and annexed it a year later. The United Nations does not
recognize Indonesian rule and is sponsoring peace talks between
Indonesia and Portugal.
	   News reports last week said Habibie had failed to fulfill his
pledge to scale down Indonesia's military presence in the
half-island territory.
	   The number of Indonesian troops in East Timor reportedly was
more than 20,000, far more than the number claimed by the
Indonesian government.
	   Also Sunday, the pro-independence Socialist Party of Timor said
Indonesia had deployed four battalions near Los Palos.
	   The party also reported fighting in the area since Friday in its
statement distributed in Lisbon.

Ajax defeats NEC Nijmegen
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Ajax Amsterdam warmed up for
Wednesday's Champions League clash with Olympiakos of Greece by
trouncing NEC Nijmegen 4-0 Sunday.
	   Ajax (7-2-2) drew level with Feyenoord at the top of the league
with 23 points, but the Rotterdammers have played a game less.
	   Ajax has scored 13 goals and conceded just one in winning its
last three games, and now has the league's best defensive and
offensive records.
	   Finn Jari Litmanen and Georgian Shota Arveladze missed good
chances before the floodlights failed in the 16th minute causing a
half-hour delay.
	   But the pair made amends soon after the restart, Litmanen with a
sharp headed goal from Ronald de Boer's center and Arveladze with a
typical striker's goal when the ball dropped loose close to goal.
	   Jack de Gier made things worse for NEC on 39 minutes when he was
sent off for a wild two-footed tackle.
	   Just as NEC was coming back into the game, Peter Hoekstra broke
on the left and pulled the ball back for Brazilian Wamberto to
score from 10 meters (yards). Then Arveladze set up Richard
Witschge for the fourth.
	   But with the game won, holes opened up in the Ajax defense, with
the inexperienced Arno Splinter at its heart, and Edwin van der Sar
had to prove his great class as a keeper with a string of saves.
	   Changing managers didn't help winless bottom club RKC Waalwijk
this week. It sacked Peter Boeve Monday after the club's seventh
defeat and appointed ex-Roda JC boss Martin Jol.
	   But a last-minute own-goal from defender Michel van Zundert
prolonged its losing streak Sunday. RKC lost 2-1 at home to De
Graafschap Doetinchem.
	   The day's other game saw Roda win 3-0 at FC Utrecht.

Berlin routs Nuremberg 3-0, moves to fourth place
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Hertha Berlin, hoping to crack the ranks of
Europe's top clubs, routed FC Nuremberg 3-0 Sunday to move to
fourth in the Bundesliga.
	   Berlin may still be far away from team management's professed
goal, but the club boasting Germany's biggest market has
established itself as a league power at home in two first division
years.
	   Sergei Mandreko's ninth minute goal, followed by a shot by
Sixten Viet seven minutes later, allowed Berlin to coast to its
fifth victory in as many outings at Olympiastadium this season.
	   Berlin, however, hasn't been able to win away. The team has
managed just two draws against three losses outside of the German
capitol.
	   Alphonse Tchami then scored the 3-0 just before the break
against Nuremberg, whose last hopes vanished in the 34th minute
when Henning Burger was ejected for repeated fouls.
	   Berlin's win also meant that four of the five teams chasing
Bayern Munich and second-place 1860 Munich gained ground on the two
frontrunners over the weekend.
	   Levekusen, Berlin, Stuttgart and Kaiserslautern picked up three
points while fifth place Hamburger SV's match was postponed because
of muddy fields.
	   Berlin's win also made up to its home fans for the 4-2 whipping
the team received last week by cross-town rival TeBe Berlin in the
German Cup.
	   ``After that Cup disaster, those early goals were important to
us,'' said Hertha coach Juergen Rober.
	   TeBe, leading the second division, is another team receiving
heavy financing in hopes of capitalizing on the huge fan base in
Berlin, which for years didn't have a single first division club.

<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Police thwarted a plan by a radical
Islamic group to attack Turkey's top leaders during the country's
75th anniversary celebrations last week, the Anatolia news agency
reported Sunday.
	   Police detained 24 people linked to a radical Islamic group in
Germany in a nationwide operation on Wednesday, Anatolia said,
quoting police sources.
	   Four group members reportedly planned to fly an explosives-laden
plane into a ceremony attended by all of Turkey's civilian and
military leaders, as well as hundreds of foreign dignitaries, at
the mausoleum of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk.
	   Ataturk set up Turkey's secular republic on Oct. 29, 1923,
following the collapse of the Ottoman Empire.
	   The men are allegedly linked the Germany-based Association of
Islamic Groups and Communities. The group, founded in 1984, wants
to overthrow Turkey's government and replace it with strict Islamic
rule, Anatolia said.
	   The celebrations were marred by a lone man who hijacked a
Turkish airlines plane Thursday evening holding 38 people hostage
for seven hours at Ankara airport.
	   Elite squads stormed the plane early Friday, safely releasing
all passengers and killing the hijacker.
	   The hijacker was protesting Turkey's Kurdish policy. Kurdish
rebels have been fighting for autonomy in Turkey's southeast since
1984.

Anti-Pinochet campaigners stage vigil before legal appeal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Belgium-Pinochet &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Some 100 campaigners, including the widow of an
American journalist who disappeared in 1973 when Gen. Augusto
Pinochet seized power, staged a vigil Sunday afternoon outside
Parliament urging that Britain should not free the former Chilean
dictator.
	   British prosecutors, on behalf of a Spanish magistrate seeking
Pinochet's extradition into allegations of murder, kidnapping and
torture during his 17-year-rule, have until Monday afternoon to
file a formal appeal against a High Court order quashing his arrest
in Britain.
	   The High Court ruled last week that the Oct. 16 arrest of
82-year-old Pinochet in a London hospital was illegal because as a
former head of state he is immune from prosecution.
	   ``I don't see Pinochet as a head of state. I see him as a head
of junta,'' said Joyce Horman, whose husband, Charles Horman,
disappeared during Pinochet's violent overthrow of President
Salvador Allende's leftist government.
	   ``He detonated the state. There wasn't any state left,'' added
Mrs. Horman whose husband was the subject of a 1982 feature film
titled ``Missing.''
	   Isabel Allende, Allende's daughter who is now a congresswoman,
and Juan Pablo Letelier, another congressman whose father, Orlando,
Allende's foreign minister, was killed in 1976, are among prominent
Pinochet opponents due to testify at the appeal.
	   Orlando Letelier was killed in Washington in 1976 by a bomb
officially blamed on Pinochet's secret police.
	   A report by Chile's democratically elected government says more
than 3,000 people were killed or disappeared during Pinochet's
rule.
	   The appeal before five judges of the House of Lords, Britain's
highest court, is expected Wednesday and Thursday.
	   A judge on Friday granted bail to Pinochet, who underwent back
surgery Oct. 9. He remains under police guard but has been moved
from a central London clinic to another private hospital,
Grovelands Priory Hospital in north London.
	   In Brussels, six Chilean exiles living in Belgium launched legal
proceedings to have Pinochet extradited to Belgium if the Spanish
bid fails, news reports said Sunday.
	   Prosecutors in France and Switzerland, at the instigation of
families of victims seeking extradition, have also opened
investigations.

NYC Marathon again belongs to Kagwe
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Optional &QL; 
 &UR; By BERT ROSENTHAL &QC; 
 &UR; AP Track Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ John Kagwe did not have to worry about loose
shoelaces this time.
	   Instead, he had to contend with Kenyan countryman Joseph Chebet
and Tanzania's Zebedayo Bayo.
	   For the second straight year, Kagwe proved the best, winning the
New York City Marathon on Sunday in 2 hours, 8 minutes, 45 seconds
_ three seconds ahead of Chebet in the second-closest finish in the
race's 29-year history.
	   ``Last year, I felt it was my race to win,'' Kagwe said. ``This
year, I was not that sure. Chebet was tough.''
	   Kagwe disproved the theory that a runner had to perform well in
shorter races leading to the marathon. Last year, he finished
second in the Philadelphia Distance Run Half-Marathon in his final
preparation for New York. This year, he was eighth.
	   While Kagwe was pressed by Chebet and Bayo, who was third at
2:08:51, the women's race turned into a runaway for Franca
Fiacconi.
	   She became the first Italian to win the women's division,
setting a personal best by nearly three minutes. She was timed in
2:25:17, beating runner-up Adriana Fernandez of Mexico (a national
record of 2:26:33) by more than a minute and world record-holder
Tegla Loroupe of Kenya by more than five minutes.
	   This was the second-fastest NYC Marathon by a woman, behind only
Australia's Lisa Ondieki, who ran 2:24:40 in 1992.
	   Loroupe, who set the world record of 2:20:47 at Rotterdam in
April and won the New York City Marathon in 1994 and 1995, couldn't
overcome severe stomach cramps and finished third at 2:30:28.
	   ``I wanted to break 2:28,'' said Fiacconi, who had finished
second at New York in 1996 and third last year. ``That was my goal.
If I did, I thought I would win.
	   ``I was not afraid of Tegla. I was not intimidated by her or
anyone else.''
	   At one point, Loroupe thought of withdrawing.
	   ``At five kilometers I started to feel my stomach,'' she said.
``At 20K I wanted to pull out. Then I decided to slow it down.''
	   Defending champion Franziska Moser-Rochat of Switzerland, who
has been hampered by two stress fractures this year, finished fifth
at 2:32:37.
	   Perhaps the most heartwarming story was that of Joan Benoit
Samuelson.
	   Winner of the first women's Olympic marathon in 1984, the
41-year-old was attempting to qualify for the 2000 U.S. Olympic
trials. Samuelson reached her goal, breaking 2:50. Her time of
2:41:06 made her the second American finisher _ 12th overall _
behind Libbie Hickman of Fort Collins, Colorado, who was sixth at
2:33:06, a career best.
	   The leading American man was Alfredo Vigueras of Woodland,
California, 18th at 2:16:14.
	   Last year, Kagwe, wearing new running shoes, had to stop twice
to tie his laces and ran the final three miles (five kilometers)
with loose laces flapping against his legs. But he had a huge lead
over Chebet and the shoelaces made no difference in the outcome,
only that he possibly could have broken the course record.
	   His time in 1997 was 2:08:12 _ 11 seconds off the course mark of
2:08:01 by Tanzania's Juma Ikangaa in 1989.
	   On Sunday, he dueled with Chebet and Bayo. Bayo dropped out of
contention shortly after they entered Central Park for the final
stretch, leaving the two Kenyans to duel.
	   The closest finish in the history of the race was two seconds,
in 1994 when Mexico's German Silva rallied after making a wrong
turn and beat countryman Benjamin Paredes.
	   ``I decided to push the pace, especially in the last 400
meters,'' Kagwe said. ``I decided to go and see if Chebet would
stay with me.''
	   It was another frustrating second-place finish for Chebet, who
also was the Boston Marathon runner-up in April.
	   ``I may have to change my tactics and train differently for a
close, tough finish,'' Chebet said. ``I lost in the last 100
meters. I'll sit down with my coach and plan something. It's hard
to take second-place finishes so often.''
	   The jubilant Fiacconi, whose time was an Italian record, gave
the thumbs-up sign twice shortly before the end, then bent and
kissed the ground after crossing the finish line.
	   Before her last two New York races, Fiacconi had run marathons
within close proximity. This time, she refrained, and was much
fresher.
	   ``I understood at 30 kilometers that I could win,'' Fiacconi
said after winning her eighth marathon in 20 tries. ``I decided to
pull away then.''
	   Two of the biggest names failed to finish. Spain's Abel Anton,
the 1997 world champion, dropped out before 17 miles (27
kilometers), and South African Josia Thugwane, the 1996 Olympic
gold medalist, quit before mile 19 (kilometer 30). It was the
second time Thugwane had dropped out of New York. In 1995, he went
out after 22 miles (35 kilometers) with leg injuries.
	   The weather at the start of the 26.2-mile (42.16-kilometer) race
was perfect for marathoners _ 50 F (10 C), 61 percent humidity, 6
mph (10 kph) wind _ as well as spectators, with an estimated 2
million lining the streets of the city's five boroughs.
	   Kagwe and Fiacconi each collected dlrs 50,000 plus bonus money
for their winning times.

Chechen leader calls off rally; says opposition agrees to
</HEADLINE>
compromise &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The embattled president of breakaway Chechnya
canceled a rally Sunday that had been intended to shore up his
support, and said his opponents had agreed to a compromise in their
political feud with him.
	   Aslan Maskhadov had called the unusual rally in Grozny, the
Chechen capital, saying he wanted to explain his policies to the
public. Opposition demonstrators had been staging protests for
weeks demanding that he step down.
	   But according to the ITAR-Tass news agency, Maskhadov canceled
the rally at the last minute after a delegation came to him from
three generals who have led the opposition against him.
	   The president's spokesman, Mairbek Vachagayev, said the generals
had agreed to an unspecified compromise.
	   ``They withdrew their demands on the resignation and asked to
sit at the negotiating table to find a common decision which would
be for the benefit of the republic as well as the people, and can
lead to better results,'' he said.
	   Two of the generals, Shamil Basayev and Salman Raduyev, have
frequently accused Maskhadov of violating Chechnya's constitution,
and have demanded his ouster for failing to bring peace to the
republic.
	   Chechnya has seen an increase in violence and kidnappings for
ransom since the end of the 1994-96 war with Russia.
	   Chechnya considers itself independent following that war, but
Russia considers it a Russian republic. Maskhadov held a surprise
meeting last week with Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, who
said there had been a breakthrough in their relations.
	   He didn't describe the nature of the breakthrough, and hasn't
publicly discussed the matter since.

Mallorca draws against Deportivo leaving Real Madrid atop table
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP)_ Held to a 1-1 draw against Deportivo on
Sunday, Mallorca lost the top spot of the Spanish soccer league to
Real Madrid but kept ahead of FC Barcelona on goal difference at
the end of the eighth round.
	   Atop the table, Madrid now boasts 17 points, one more than
Mallorca and Barcelona.
	   Playing at home, Deportivo dominated midfield for the first half
hour of Sunday's match, keeping Mallorca's Argentine star 'keeper
Carlos Roa on his toes.
	   Then a goal from fellow Argentine Leonardo Biagini in the 32nd
minute put Mallorca one up _ a tidy finish to the team's first
opportunity of the match that began with a dash up the right wing
from Daniel 'Dani' Gonzalez.
	   The equalizer came ten minutes later when Brazil's Djalminha
broke Roa's unbeaten record this season from the penalty spot.
	   After the break Mallorca dominated play but was unable to find
the back of Deportivo's net.
	   Coming in the wake of Madrid's 5-1 routing of lowly Extremadura
on Saturday, the draw meant Mallorca's brief period of glory at the
top of the table was over.
	   But with Roa still the Spanish season's best goalkeeper,
Mallorca remained at No. 2 with 16 points, ahead of Barcelona on
goal difference.
	   The Catalan superteam had trounced Real Sociedad 4-1 on
Saturday.
	   In Sunday's other games Tenerife routed division newcomer
Villarreal 5-2 in a spectacular draw between two relatively lowly
clubs.
	   Makaay scored his and Tenerife's first goal the 38th minute,
with Brazilian Emerson Moises Costa making it 2-0 one minute later.
Just before the break, Moises Garcia shot home a penalty for
Villarreal awarded against Argentine Pablo Ariel Paz for a foul on
David Albeldas.
	   Out on the field again, Andre Luiz of Brazil scored Tenerife's
third in the 49th minute, Imanol Alguacil pulled one back for
Villarreal in the 62nd, before Makaay scored his second goal and
take the score to 4-2. Samuel Slovak of Slovakia sealed the final
5-2 scoreline with 10 minutes left to play.
	   Elsewhere, Valladolid overcame Oviedo 2-1 in another result that
rearranged the lower half of the table.
	   Jose Luis Perez Caminero scored the first goal of the match in
the 55th minute for Valladolid, and Croatian Alen Peternac made it
2-0 in the 64th.
	   A goal from Panamanian Julio Cesar Dely Valdes in the 71st
minute reduced the size of Oviedo's defeat.
	   In the remaining matches of the round played Saturday it was:
Atletico Madrid 3, Alaves 0; Athletic Bilbao 2, Espanyol 2; Betis
1, Salamanca 0; Valencia 4, Zaragoza 1; and Racing Santander 2,
Celta 2.

deadly dance-hall fire, investigators grappled for clues Sunday

Argentine President says visit was big success
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) _ Carlos Menem said Sunday his visit to
Britain _ the first by an Argentine president since the 1982
Falkland Islands war _ had been a ``resounding success.''
	   Menem addressed a meeting of business leaders, the Confederation
of British Industry, and was flying home late Sunday direct from
this central England city.
	   During the six-day visit, in a gesture of reconciliation Menem
laid a wreath to the 1,000 people killed in the war over the
still-disputed south Atlantic archipelago.
	   In his final speech, Menem made no direct reference to the
Falkland Islands.
	   He hailed booming trade between Argentina and Britain, and his
government's success in cutting inflation to below one percent from
a 1989 peak of 5,000 percent.
	   Slashing inflation was achieved partly by selling state-owned
enterprises to private companies, he said.
	   ``What did we privatize? Everything,'' Menem added to applause.

Ohio State is AP's second most popular No. 1
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RICHARD ROSENBLATT &QC; 
 &UR; AP Football Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Ohio State became the second most popular No. 1
team in the history of The Associated Press' Top 25 college
football poll on Sunday.
	   The Buckeyes (8-0), after a 38-7 victory over Indiana, easily
held the top spot for the ninth consecutive regular-season poll. It
also marks the 72nd week in which Ohio State has been ranked No. 1
since the AP poll began in 1936.
	   Notre Dame tops the list with 94 No. 1 rankings. Ohio State had
been tied with Oklahoma.
	   With its 38-7 win over Indiana on Saturday, the Buckeyes moved
to 51-7-1 while playing as the No. 1 team.
	   UCLA (7-0), which held the No. 2 spot for the last three polls,
dropped to No. 3 this week after a 28-24 win over Stanford (1-7).
	   Tennessee (7-0), a 49-14 winner over South Carolina, moved up to
No. 2 for the first time this season. The Volunteers became the
fifth team ranked No. 2 in '98. The others were Florida State,
Florida, Nebraska and UCLA.
	   Ohio State received 63 of 70 first-place votes and 1,743 points
from the sports writers and broadcasters on the AP panel. Tennessee
had three first-place votes and 1,642 points, while UCLA had one
first-place vote and 1,601 points.
	   Kansas State (8-0), which routed Kansas 54-6, remained No. 4
with three first-place votes and 1,583 points, followed by No. 5
Florida, No. 6 Florida State, No. 7 Texas A and M, No. 8 Wisconsin,
No. 9 Penn State and No. 10 Arizona.
	   Wondering about Nebraska? The Cornhuskers (7-2), who lost to
Texas 20-16, were No. 14 _ the first time they've been out of the
Top 10 since a No. 14 ranking in the final poll of the 1992 season,
an amazing streak of 96 consecutive polls.
	   Arkansas (7-0), a 24-21 winner over Auburn, moved up three spots
to No. 11, followed No. 12 Virginia, No. 13 Notre Dame, No. 14
Nebraska and a rare three-way tie at No. 15 between Syracuse,
Tulane and Virginia Tech.
	   The three-way tie was the first since Oct. 23, 1972, when
Arkansas, SMU and West Virginia were all No. 18.
	   Tulane (8-0), after a 72-20 win over Southwestern Louisiana, has
its highest ranking since Dec. 3, 1979.
	   Missouri, a 28-26 winner over Texas Tech, was No. 18, followed
by No. 19 Georgia, No. 20 Texas, No. 21 Oregon, No. 22 Michigan,
No. 23 Georgia Tech, No. 24 Miami and No. 25 Air Force.
	   In the USA Today/ESPN coaches' poll, the top five were Ohio
State, Kansas State, Tennessee, UCLA and Florida.
	   Florida, a 38-7 winner over Georgia, moved ahead of Florida
State into the No. 5 spot, while the Bulldogs fell eight spots to
No. 19. Oregon fell nine spots to No. 21 after its 38-3 loss to
Arizona.
	   Texas (6-2) and Air Force (7-1) returned to the Top 25, while
West Virginia (4-3) and Colorado (6-2) dropped out.

Clinton says summit talks were peppered with moments of anger
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LAURIE COPANS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ United States President Bill Clinton said in an
interview Sunday that the negotiations which led to the
Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement last month were volatile and
heated at times.
	   In an interview with Israel's Channel 2 television, Clinton said
he had used ``graphic'' language at points when Israel's position
in the talks seemed inappropriate to the president.
	   Clinton said there were times when he felt each side was wrong
and said so.
	   But the president said Israeli media reports that he had
outright insulted Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at a delicate
moment during the eight days of negotiations at a resort in eastern
Maryland, were inaccurate.
	   ``It is true that there was a moment in which there was a heated
exchange in which I said something rather graphic but I did not
adversely characterize the prime minister,'' Clinton said.
	   Clinton said the issue was not of Jonathan Pollard, an American
citizen jailed for spying for Israel. Clinton said Netanyahu had
``argued strongly,'' for Pollard's release. A last-minute Israeli
attempt to connect Pollard's release to the agreement nearly
derailed the entire accord.
	   The U.S.-brokered summit talks between Netanyahu and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat led to the signing on Oct. 23 of a
land-for-peace accord and an end to 19 months of deadlock between
the sides.
	   Clinton also said that his scheduled visit to the Gaza Strip
next month should not be misinterpreted as a recognition of a
Palestinian state. He said the aim was to boost the peace process
and oversee the PLO's cancellation of sections in its charter which
call for Israel's destruction.
	   ``At that meeting we will see a clear denunciation of the
offending parts of the charter and a general endorsement of the
whole agreement,'' the president said.
	   Clinton said he had thought during the intense negotiations at
the Wye River conference center, of slain Israeli prime minister
Yitzhak Rabin, who began peace-making with the Palestinians in
1993.
	   ``I think always when I'm pushing the peace process forward that
I'm doing it not just for myself but also a little for him,''
	   Clinton said the latest accord would take effect on the
anniversary of the assassination. Rabin was gunned down on Nov. 4,
1995 at a Tel Aviv peace rally by a Jewish nationalist extremist
who said he wanted to prevent the further transfer of land to the
Palestinians.
	   ``None of us would be here if it hadn't been for him,'' Clinton
said of Rabin's contribution to the peace process.
	   ``It was his conviction and the strength and security that he
conveyed to the people of Israel I think that made this whole peace
process possible,'' Clinton added.

Guerrillas besiege jungle capital, cutting off 100 police officers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By FRANK BAJAK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Some 200 rebels attacked a remote state
capital near the Brazilian border before dawn Sunday, killing at
least four police officers, wounding seven and cutting off
communications, the army said.
	   The guerrillas of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or
FARC, the country's oldest and largest rebel band, besieged the
police garrison in Mitu, capital of Vaupes state, where 100
officers were stationed, said Gen. Jorge Humberto Cortes, the
army's regional commander.
	   Fighting raged in the southeastern town all day, and warplanes
and helicopters were sent to aid the besieged police officers.
	   ``The last radio communication we had with the police was at 11
a.m.,'' said Capt. Orlando Castano, an army spokesman. At that
point there were four officers dead and seven wounded, he said.
	   Castano said rebels cut off telephone communications with Mitu
at 5:40 p.m.
	   On the Vaupes River, the Amazon Basin city has 15,000 residents
and can only be reached by air and river. Although no soldiers are
based in the city, its police post is well fortified and surrounded
by barbed wire and trenches, said Castano.
	   The army said FARC rebels had seized the airport, allowing only
a Red Cross helicopter to land to evacuate the wounded.
	   The attack comes exactly a week before the government has
promised to withdraw all troops from a huge area of southern
Colombia, 42,000 square kilometers (16,200 square miles), to meet a
FARC condition for getting peace talks under way.
	   No date has been announced for the talks and a letter from the
FARC commander to the government's chief negotiator, released
Sunday, suggests it may be weeks before negotiations begin.
	   In the Oct. 20 letter, Manuel Marulanda says ``the military high
command has created special commando units to sabotage the
beginning of the dialogue,'' accusing them of planning to kill him
and President Andres Pastrana at an inaugural ceremony.
	   ``For this reason, my presence at the act is not assured,''
Marulanda said in the letter, which was sent to the Radionet
network.
	   Marulanda also said hooded soldiers were searching vehicles in
the zone. The federal ombudsman said last week that paramilitary
gunmen, private armies that have been linked to the military and
kill alleged guerrilla sympathizers, had entered the zone and could
imperil peace talks.
	   The government's chief negotiator, Victor G. Ricardo, told The
Associated Press on Sunday that he had not received the letter.
Ricardo returned Friday with Pastrana from a three-day state visit
to Washington.
	   Before Sunday, the FARC was holding at least 248 soldiers and
police officers captive. It has asked the government to exchange
them for 452 jailed rebels before peace talks commence. So far,
Pastrana has refused.

I'm doing it not just for myself but also a little for him,''
	   Clinton said the latest accord would take effect on the
anniversary of the assassination. Rabin was gunned down on Nov. 4,
1995 at a Tel Aviv peace rally by a Jewish nationalist extremist
who said he wanted to prevent the further transfer of land to the
Palestinians.
	   ``None of us would be here if it hadn't been for him,'' Clinton
said of Rabin's contribution to the peace process.
	   ``It was his conviction and the strength and security that he
conveyed to the people of Israel I think that made this whole peace
process possible,'' Clinton added.

Woman accused of Second World War crimes extradited to Croatia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) - Nada Sakic, wanted in Croatia for
alleged Second World War crimes in the Jasenovac concentration
camp, was extradited to Zagreb Sunday, said the Argentine Federal
police.
	   Nada Sakic was embarked in a Lufthansa flight that took off for
Frankfurt at 2030GMT. She will proceed to Croatia in anocher flight
Monday.
	   Her husband, Dinko Sakic, who commanded the Jasenovac camp, had
already been extradited to Croatia on June 18 and is awaiting trial
in Zagreb. Nada was in charge of the concentration camp's female
section. Thousands of Serbs, Jews and Gypsies were killed in
Jasenovac by the pro-Nazi Croatian regime of the late Ante Pavelic.
	   Mrs Sakic, 76, had been under arrest since last August in the
city of Dolores, some 200 kilometers South. A Federal police patrol
car drove her this afternoon from Dolores to the Buenos Aires
Ezeiza International Airport, where Interpol and Croatian policemen
were awaiting her.

U.S. official says fear still hindering return of refugees

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ethnic Albanian rebels opened fire
Sunday on a police patrol in western Kosovo, wounding one
policeman, Serb sources said. A senior U.S. official complained
that fear of the police is delaying efforts to return refugees to
their homes.
	   The government-run Serb Media Center said the attack took place
Sunday afternoon, when four Kosovo Liberation Army guerrillas
opened fire on a police patrol near Glodjane, 65 kilometers (40
miles) west of Pristina.
	   Serb policemen returned fire, the center said, but there was no
word on rebel casualties. The report could not be independently
confirmed, and there was no comment from ethnic Albanian sources.
	   American and European diplomats have appealed to the ethnic
Albanian separatists to honor the Oct. 12 peace agreement between
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and U.S. envoy Richard
Holbrooke.
	   International envoys fear that continued violence will undermine
their efforts to encourage tens of thousands of ethnic Albanian
refugees to return to homes they fled after Milosevic launched a
crackdown on KLA militants Feb. 28.
	   That in turn could lead to a humanitarian disaster when the
bitter Balkan winter sets in.
	   Despite weeks of relative peace in Kosovo, U.S. Assistant
Secretary of State Julia Taft said fear of Serb police and soldiers
continues to prevent thousands of refugees from returning home,
although significant progress has occurred in implementing the
Kosovo peace deal.
	   After visiting two villages and meeting with a range of relief
officials, Taft said conditions in the war-torn province were much
better than during her previous visit two months ago.
	   While many of the 50,000 or more refugees who had been living in
the woods have returned to villages, some still were staying away
from their homes, she said.
	   ``It's difficult to say that everybody is able to go back home
or is willing to go back home,'' Taft told a news conference.
``There is fear among the population.''
	   She saw that fear firsthand earlier, during a visit to an ethnic
Albanian compound in the foothills south of Pec, 100 kilometers (60
miles) west of Pristina.
	   An ethnic Albanian family complained that Serb police harass
them, arrest people and make them feel unsafe, despite the Oct. 12
agreement.
	   They said only international troops, not the unarmed foreign
verification force being created, could solve their problem.
	   ``The Westerners are not going to solve the problem,'' Taft told
the family. ``The people who live here must come to an agreement to
solve their problem.''
	   But the head of the family, who asked that his name not be used
because he feared retribution by Serb police, told her: ``I don't
think that it will be possible.''
	   Taft later said Serb police had decreased their visibility,
noting she passed only three checkpoints during her travels Sunday,
compared to the dozens that used to exist.
	   Acknowledging that even a small police presence concerned
residents, she called the creation of a civilian police force in
Kosovo a ``high priority'' for the international community.
	   She also expressed concern for reports that Serb police and
ethnic Albanian guerrillas were detaining people.

<TEXT>
	   BRIDGETOWN, Barbados (AP) _ Jamaica's prime minister is urging
Caribbean countries to band together to defend the death penalty
against international pressure to eliminate it.
	   During a speech to a convention of the ruling Barbados Labor
Party on Saturday, P.J. Patterson said the 15-member Caribbean
Community should send a resolution supporting the death penalty to
the United Nations, the Organization of American States and the
British Privy Council, the supreme court for most former British
colonies in the region.
	   ``We cannot allow any ... power to dictate what should be our
law and what should be the penalties,'' Patterson said.
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook has urged Caribbean
countries to abandon the death penalty, and international watchdog
groups Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have increased
their own lobbying.
	   Caribbean countries have accused the Privy Council of trying to
restrict executions with a 1993 ruling that it is inhumane to keep
any prisoner on death row for more than five years. The ruling
effectively overturned the death sentences of dozens of convicts.
	   Jamaica and Trinidad have also accused the OAS' Interamerican
Human Rights Commission, an international appeals tribunal, of
delaying reviews of death-sentence cases. Both countries have said
they will withdraw from the human rights declaration that created
the commission.
	   Caribbean countries say they want to speed up executions because
they deter crime linked to drug trafficking through the region.
	   The Bahamas hanged two men on Oct. 15, its first executions
since 1996. St. Kitts and Nevis executed its first prisoner in 13
years on July 20.
	   Jamaica withdrew from the rights commission this year and is
leading formation of a regional supreme court to replace the Privy
Council. ``The time has come for a final court of our own,''
Patterson said.
	   During his speech, Patterson also criticized wealthier countries
``who want uncontrolled access to our territorial space whether by
land, sea or air.''
	   The comment was an apparent reference to the United States,
which has asked Caribbean countries to allow U.S. drug agents to
chase smugglers into their waters. Jamaica balked at the request,
but later signed a renegotiated agreement.
	   ``There are those who see us as an unwelcome presence in their
backyard and simply as a route that must be closed to prevent the
traffic of illicit drugs into their living rooms,'' Patterson said.

Chilean in Norway files against Pinochet
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ A Chilean exile in Norway has filed a legal
action against former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet, alleging
his responsibility for the disappearance of two close friends in
1974.
	   Marcelo Ferrada-Noli, a professor at the University of Tromsoe,
told the Norwegian news agency NTB on Sunday that the complaint was
filed last Tuesday.
	   Similar actions have been filed in Spain, Switzerland, Sweden,
France, Italy and Belgium.
	   Ferrada-Noli said he hoped that the suit would add to the
pressure to extradite the Chilean general to Spain from Britain,
where he was arrested some two weeks ago after a Spanish judge
demanded his extradition. Pinochet was released from arrest this
weekend by London's High Court, but cannot leave Britain until his
appeal has been handled by the House of Lords.
	   Ferrada-Noli's two childhood friends, Edgardo Enriques and
Bautista van Schoewen, who were active on the Chilean left during
the government of Salvador Allende, never were seen again after
their arrest in Santiago. Ferrada-Noli has worked for years to find
out about their fate.
	   Ferrada-Noli came to Sweden as a refugee in 1975. He was
interned in the soccer stadium in his home town of Concepcion after
the 1973 coup that Pinochet led, and spent the next two years in
various Chilean prisons.
	   The former Concepcion university teacher was a professor at the
Karolinska hospital in Stockholm until he moved to Norway last year
to take a post as professor of psychology. He also teaches social
medicine at Harvard Medical School.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ United States President Bill Clinton said in an
interview Sunday that the negotiations which led to the
Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement last month were volatile and
heated at times.
	   In an interview with Israel's Channel 2 television, Clinton said
he had used ``graphic'' language at points when Israel's position
in the talks seemed inappropriate to the president.
	   Clinton said there were times when he felt each side was wrong
and said so.
	   But the president said Israeli media reports that he had
outright called Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ``despicable,''
at a delicate moment during the eight days of negotiations at a
resort in eastern Maryland, were inaccurate.

Kabila allies vow to intensify fighting against Congolese rebels
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with meeting ending, Zimbabwe leader vowing to
intensify attacks on Congo rebels, criticizing U.S. peace efforts;

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe said
on Sunday that his troops and their southern African allies would
step up their attacks on Congo rebels. He also criticized U.S.
efforts to broker a peace agreement.
	   Mugabe, after a summit with Congolese President Laurent Kabila
and officials from military allies Angola and Namibia in the
southeastern Congolese town of Lubumbashi, said the allies were
launching an offensive ``to clear the enemy'' from Congolese
territory.
	   He said the allies, fighting alongside Kabila's forces, occupied
bases in eastern Congo after thwarting a rebel advance on the
western capital, Kinshasa, in August, the official Zimbabwe news
agency reported.
	   Mugabe disputed rebel claims they have made rapid advances from
their eastern strongholds.
	   ```We are fighting and not losing any ground,'' Mugabe said, the
Zimbabwe news agency reported.
	   U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Africa Susan Rice is
scheduled to visit Zimbabwe on Monday. Rice is on a regional
shuttle to press for peace negotiations and the withdrawal of
foreign troops from Congo.
	   Mugabe said that Rice failed to recognize the allies' role.
	   ``It's extremely abominable to place us who have come here in
search of peace and stability ... at the same level with invaders
and aggressors,'' he said.
	   Kabila has claimed Ugandan and Rwandan troops are fighting with
the rebels, but Rwandan officials have persistently denied this.
	   Kabila told reporters that a four-hour meeting he held with Rice
made little progress.
	   ``We have told the Americans that peace starts by asking the
aggressors to retreat from the Congo territory, but they are not of
our view,'' he said.
	   Mugabe said Namibia's President Sam Nujoma was in Lubumbashi for
the summit Sunday. President Eduardo Dos Santos of Angola was
unable to attend but sent his support for the allies.
	   Lubumbashi, Kabila's home town, is being used as a major base
for allied troops, including some of Zimbabwe's 6,000 troops in the
Congo.
	   The summit came after two days of talks in the Zambian capital,
Lusaka, last week that failed to hammer out a cease-fire after
Congolese rebels were excluded from that meeting.
	   Uganda has admitted its troops were in eastern Congo, but says
its forces are there to attack Congo-based Ugandan rebels.
	   The Lusaka talks were the latest effort to end hostilities in
the three-month civil war in the vast central African country,
which has drawn in Namibia, Zimbabwe, Angola, Chad and reportedly
Sudan on the government's side.
	   Rwanda and Uganda favor the rebels.
	   The rebel forces, composed of ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted
members of Kabila's army and opposition politicians, accuse Kabila
of corruption, mismanagement and stirring up ethnic rivalries.
	   The same forces supported Kabila last year when he ousted
dictator Mobutu Sese Seko from Congo, formerly known as Zaire.

	   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) _ Rescue workers recovered bodies Sunday
from communities buried when a lake in a volcano crater overflowed
and sent tons of mud and rock hurtling down on villages below. The
finds boosted the death toll from former Hurricane Mitch to at
least 705.
	   Authorities feared that many more bodies would be found in 10
communities at the foot of the Casitas Volcano in northern
Nicaragua.
	   Mitch was one of the most violent hurricanes to hit the
Caribbean, causing heavy rains and floods as it cut a fatal path
along the coasts of Honduras, Nicaragua and other Central American
countries.
	   The first army rescue helicopters to reach the volcano on Sunday
found widespread destruction, an army spokesman said. Rescue
workers recovered 87 bodies in four villages near Posoltega, about
50 miles (80 kms) northwest of Managua.
	   A river of mud and rubble collapsed on the villages Friday after
a crater lake near the volcano's peak overflowed and caused part of
the mountain to crumble, army spokesman Capt. Milton Sandoval said.
	   About 1,800 of the communities' 2,000 residents were listed as
missing, Sandoval said.
	   It was unclear whether the residents of the villages of El
Porvenir, Versalles, Rolando Rodriguez and Santa Narcisa had fled
in time to avoid the mudslide or were asleep in their homes when it
struck.
	   A woman who claimed to have survived the disaster told Radio
Nicaragua on Sunday that she had seen ``many unburied bodies'' in
orchards near the volcano.
	   The survivor, Mercedes Rodriguez Zapata, claimed to have left
the area Saturday and traveled on foot and horseback to the
capital, Managua.
	   Unconfirmed radio reports said as many as 4,000 people may have
died when mudslides struck in the northwestern province of
Chinandega.
	   The newspaper El Nuevo Diario on Sunday called Mitch's death
toll ``apocalyptic'' and said it may be the country's worst natural
disaster since a magnitude-6.2 earthquake killed 5,000 people in
1972.
	   By official count, 225 people have been killed in Nicaragua
alone from heavy rain and flash flooding _ apparently in addition
to the 87 dead in Posoltega _ for a total of 312. Another 253
people were listed as missing, the National Civil Defense reported.
	   Nicaragua has asked the United States to lend it several large
helicopters to help deliver supplies and assess damage in remote
areas, Defense Minister Pedro J. Chamorro Barrios said Saturday.
	   In Honduras, at least 231 deaths have been blamed on Mitch, the
National Emergency Commission said Saturday.
	   El Salvador _ where 140 people died in flash floods _ declared a
state of emergency Saturday, as did Guatemala, where 21 people died
when floods swept away their homes. Mexico reported one death from
Mitch last Monday.
	   In the Caribbean, the U.S. Coast Guard widened a search for a
tourist schooner with 31 people aboard that hasn't been heard from
since Tuesday.
	   By late Sunday, Mitch's winds, once near 180 mph (290 kph), had
dropped to near 30 mph (50 kph), and the storm _ now classified as
a tropical depression _ was near Tapachula, on Mexico's southern
Pacific coast near the Guatemalan border.
	   Mitch was moving west at 8 mph (13 kph) and was dissipating but
threatened to strengthen again if it moved back out to sea.

	   A river of mud and rubble collapsed on the villages Friday after
a crater lake near the volcano's peak overflowed and caused part of
the mountain to crumble, army spokesman Capt. Milton Sandoval said.
	   Only 92 of the estimated 2,000 area residents were found alive,
some injured, and the remainder were listed as missing, Sandoval
said.
	   Rescuers aboard the first army helicopters to reach the
communities found hundreds of decomposing bodies, he said. One
hundred soldiers working at the scene were burying the rotting
bodies of the victims where they lay because of public health
concerns, Sandoval said.
	   It was unclear whether some residents of the villages of El
Porvenir, Versalles, Rolando Rodriguez and Santa Narcisa had fled
in time to avoid the mudslide or were asleep in their homes when it
struck.
	   A woman who claimed to have survived the disaster told Radio
Nicaragua on Sunday that she had seen ``many unburied bodies'' in
orchards near the volcano.
	   The survivor, Mercedes Rodriguez Zapata, claimed to have left
the area Saturday and traveled on foot and horseback to the
capital, Managua.
	   Unconfirmed radio reports said as many as 4,000 people may have
died when mudslides struck in the northwestern province of
Chinandega.
	   The newspaper El Nuevo Diario on Sunday called Mitch's death
toll ``apocalyptic'' and said it may be the country's worst natural
disaster since a magnitude-6.2 earthquake killed 5,000 people in
1972.
	   By official count, 225 people have been killed in Nicaragua
alone from heavy rain and flash flooding _ apparently in addition
to the 360 dead in Posoltega _ for a total of 585. Another 253
people were listed as missing, the National Civil Defense reported.
	   Nicaragua has asked the United States to lend it several large
helicopters to help deliver supplies and assess damage in remote
areas, Defense Minister Pedro J. Chamorro Barrios said Saturday.

Menem vows to visit Falklands before term is up next year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ President Carlos Menem said in
comments published Sunday that he hopes to visit the Falkland
Islands before his term is up next year.
	   Menem told the Buenos Aires daily Clarin that he was convinced
he would be able to make the visit to the islands, called the
Malvinas by Argentines, following what he called the ``resounding
success'' of his visit to Britain.
	   Britain and Argentina fought a 10-week war over the windswept
South Atlantic archipelago in 1982, won by the British. There have
been no direct links between the islands and Argentina since, not
even air connections.
	   ``The acceptance we had in Britain was truly exceptional, not
only on the part of the authorities, but on the part of the
people,'' Menem told Clarin. ``This really gives me pause to
believe that visiting the islands is possible.''
	   Menem became the first Argentine president to visit Britain
since that war. His term is to expire on Dec. 10, 1999.
	   Menem made his comments in interviews with Argentine newspapers
in London where he met Prime Minister Tony Blair and sought
reconciliation with Britain over the war.
	   However, sovereignty over the islands off southern Argentine was
not up for discussion during the past week's meetings with Blair.
Both countries still dispute the islands.
	   Speaking with the other major Argentine daily, La Nacion, Menem
raised the possibility of a visit by Blair to Argentina in the
coming year.
	   ``He told me he had a very busy schedule this year, and that
perhaps next year he could visit,'' Menem was quoted as telling La
Nacion.
	   Menem also praised a string of agreements signed by both nations
on trade, sports and other issues. He was flying home late Sunday.
	   During the visit, in a gesture of reconciliation Menem laid a
wreath to the 1,000 people killed in the war.
	   In his final speech Sunday in central England, Menem made no
direct reference to the Falkland Islands. He hailed booming trade
between Argentina and Britain, and his government's success in
cutting inflation to below one percent from a 1989 peak of 5,000
percent.
	   Slashing inflation was achieved partly by selling state-owned
enterprises to private companies, he said. ``What did we privatize?
Everything,'' Menem added to applause.

	   In Honduras, at least 231 deaths have been blamed on Mitch, the
National Emergency Commission said Saturday.
	   El Salvador _ where 140 people died in flash floods _ declared a
state of emergency Saturday, as did Guatemala, where 21 people died
when floods swept away their homes. Mexico reported one death from
Mitch last Monday.
	   In the Caribbean, the U.S. Coast Guard widened a search for a
tourist schooner with 31 people aboard that hasn't been heard from
since Tuesday.
	   By late Sunday, Mitch's winds, once near 180 mph (290 kph), had
dropped to near 30 mph (50 kph), and the storm _ now classified as
a tropical depression _ was near Tapachula, on Mexico's southern
Pacific coast near the Guatemalan border.
	   Mitch was moving west at 8 mph (13 kph) and was dissipating but
threatened to strengthen again if it moved back out to sea.

Lockout talks resume Monday
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRIS SHERIDAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The North American National Basketball
Association lockout entered its fifth month on Sunday, with both
sides ready to resume bargaining on the week the regular season was
supposed to begin.
	   League and union lawyers are to meet Monday, with the full
negotiating teams for the owners and players to meet Wednesday.
	   The season was supposed to begin Tuesday night, but the first
month of the schedule has been wiped out because of the work
stoppage. More cancellations are certain if an agreement isn't
reached by next weekend.
	   ``This thing is pretty much in David Stern's hands, and I'm not
unduly optimistic,'' said agent Steve Kaufman, a member of the
union's agents advisory committee.
	   ``To me, there's two windows to get it done. One is right now.
You get the season started by Dec. 1, satisfy TNT and possibly
enable a full schedule. But if it's not done in next week to 10
days, you're looking at a Christmas or New Year's scenario for
starting the season. And I don't think either side will make a bad
deal just to reach the Dec. 1 goal,'' Kaufman said.
	   The two sides made more progress last week than they had in the
previous 4 1/2 months, agreeing on a loose framework for a
collective bargaining agreement.
	   The biggest hurdle is an agreement on what percentage of
revenues will be devoted to salaries by the time the new system has
been in place a few years. The owners want to pay 50 percent (a
movement off their previous demand for 48) and the players want to
receive 60 percent (a move from 63 percent).
	   If the sides split the difference, it would give the players 55
percent of revenues.
	   But the players received 57 percent last season, and there's a
feeling among many agents that the union shouldn't drop to 55
percent because it has already given the owners numerous
concessions.
	   The union is asking for a five-year deal, the owners want a
seven-year deal.
	   The sides have agreed that the first two or three years would be
played under a ``luxury tax'' system, the next two or three years
would also include an ``escrow tax,'' and the last year would be a
combination of the two plans.
	   Under the luxury tax, any owner who signs a player to a high-end
contract would pay a premium.
	   After initially proposing a tax of 50 percent on the amount of
any annual salary above dlrs 18 million, the union lowered it's
threshold number to dlrs 15 million, according to people involved
in the talks who spoke to the Associated Press on condition of
anonymity.
	   The owners, meanwhile, have been asking for a maximum salary
equal to 30 percent of the salary cap (about dlrs 9.3 million next
season), and revised that demand last week by setting dlrs 12
million as the maximum salary for players who have been in the
league 10 years or more and dlrs 8 million for players with six
years' or less of experience.
	   The owners also moved off their demand for the elimination of
the dlrs 1 million exception, which allowed every team, even if
over the cap, to sign an extra player for dlrs 1 million once every
two years.
	   They proposed an exception starting at dlrs 1.5 million and
growing to dlrs 2 million in three years, while the union has stuck
to its demand for an exception available every season for the
amount of the average salary, which was dlrs 2.6 million last
season.
	   Clearly, there has been some compromise already, and more is
expected. The question now is whether the sides will wrap this up
quickly or possibly drag the dispute into a sixth month.
	   ``The owners are right and the players are right,'' Dennis
Rodman told the Chicago Tribune. ``There is no happy medium.
	   ``They should just cancel the whole season and let everybody get
a real job. Then you'll see how they really feel. I bet then
they'll come to an agreement real quick,'' Rodman said.

Clinton says summit talks were peppered with moments of anger
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LAURIE COPANS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton said in an
interview Sunday that the negotiations that led to the
Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement last month were volatile and
heated at times.
	   In an interview with Israel's Channel 2 television, Clinton said
he had used ``graphic'' language at points when Israel's position
seemed inappropriate. Clinton said there were times when he felt
each side was wrong and said so.
	   But the president denied Israeli reports that he had called
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ``despicable'' at a delicate
moment during the eight days of negotiations at a resort outside
Washington.
	   ``It is true that there was a moment in which there was a heated
exchange in which I said something rather graphic, but I did not
adversely characterize the prime minister,'' Clinton said.
	   Clinton said the issue was not of Jonathan Pollard, an American
citizen jailed for spying for Israel. Clinton said Netanyahu had
``argued strongly'' for Pollard's release. A last-minute Israeli
attempt to connect Pollard's release to the agreement nearly
derailed the entire accord.
	   The U.S.-brokered summit talks between Netanyahu and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat led to the signing on Oct. 23 of a
land-for-peace accord and an end to 19 months of deadlock between
the sides.
	   Clinton also said that his scheduled visit to the Gaza Strip
next month should not be misinterpreted as a recognition of a
Palestinian state. He said the aim was to boost the peace process
and oversee the PLO's cancellation of sections in its charter that
call for Israel's destruction.
	   Clinton said that during the negotiations at the Wye River
conference center, he thought of slain Israeli prime minister
Yitzhak Rabin, who began peace-making with the Palestinians in
1993.
	   ``I think always when I'm pushing the peace process forward that
I'm doing it not just for myself but also a little for him,''
	   Rabin was gunned down on Nov. 4, 1995, at a Tel Aviv peace rally
by a Jewish nationalist extremist.

Chilean in Norway files against Pinochet
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITS to some points &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ A Chilean exile in Norway has filed a legal
action against former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet, alleging
his responsibility for the disappearance of two close friends in
1974.
	   Marcelo Ferrada-Noli, a professor at the University of Tromsoe,
told the Norwegian news agency NTB on Sunday that the complaint was
filed last Tuesday.
	   Similar actions have been filed in Spain, Switzerland, Sweden,
France, Italy and Belgium.
	   Ferrada-Noli said he hoped the lawsuit would add to the pressure
to extradite the Chilean general to Spain from Britain, where he
was arrested two weeks ago after a Spanish judge demanded his
extradition. London's High Court quashed the arrest warrant last
week, but Pinochet cannot leave Britain until his appeal has been
handled by the House of Lords.
	   Ferrada-Noli's two childhood friends, Edgardo Enriques and
Bautista van Schoewen, who were active on the Chilean left during
the government of Salvador Allende, never were seen again after
their arrest in Santiago. Ferrada-Noli has worked for years to find
out about their fate.
	   Ferrada-Noli came to Sweden as a refugee in 1975. He was
interned in the soccer stadium in his home town of Concepcion after
the 1973 coup that Pinochet led, and spent the next two years in
various Chilean prisons.
	   The former Concepcion university teacher was a professor at the
Karolinska hospital in Stockholm until he moved to Norway last year
to take a post as professor of psychology. He also teaches social
medicine at Harvard Medical School.

Macedonians finish second, final round of parliamentary elections
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with preliminary unofficial results &QL; 
 &UR; By KONSTANTIN TESTORIDES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) _ An opposition coalition Sunday claimed
the lead over Macedonia's ruling former Communists in preliminary,
unofficial results from parliamentary elections.
	   But the country's ethnic Albanians could determine the new
government. The outcome could affect NATO's verification mission in
neighboring Kosovo.
	   About 44 percent of the 1.5 million voters in the former
Yugoslav republic cast ballots Sunday. First results in what was
the second and final round of balloting are not expected before
Monday.
	   Macedonian television reported that the opposition was claiming
it had won a total of 38 seats in the 120-member parliament after
both Sunday's balloting and the first round Oct. 18. The ethnic
Albanian party claimed 24 seats so far, followed by the ruling
Social Democrats claiming 23, the Liberals with four and the
Socialists with one.
	   The remaining 29 seats were either too close to call or no
reports were available, television said. All figures were based on
claims by the parties themselves, who have poll watchers at each
counting station.
	   National election officials would not confirm any of the
figures.
	   If neither the opposition nor the ruling Social Democrats wins
an outright majority, the ethnic Albanian party will likely
determine which group ends up at the head of a new coalition
government.
	   NATO wants to use Macedonia as a base for its aerial
surveillance of the province and station a security force to
protect the 2,000-member ground verification force in Kosovo, a
province of the Yugoslav republic of Serbia.
	   But the opposition had questioned whether Macedonia should
become involved, even indirectly, in the Kosovo crisis.
	   During the election campaign, the opposition coalition said it
opposed the stationing of foreign military forces in Macedonia.
After the first round, however, it appeared to soften that
position, saying it would maintain ``continuity'' in international
agreements reached by the current government.
	   The main issues were Macedonia's weak economy and disputes with
neighbors Bulgaria, Albania and Greece. The average monthly salary
is $210, and unemployment is at 30 percent.
	   Macedonia declared independence from Yugoslavia six years ago,
the only former republic to have done so without a war. But
tensions are high due to a large ethnic Albanian community and a
border with Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians have been fighting for
independence.
	   Ethnic Albanians make up 23 percent of Macedonia's 2.2 million
people.
	   Relations with Bulgaria are also strained. The Macedonians want
bilateral agreements written ``in Macedonian and Bulgarian''
languages. Bulgaria refuses to recognize the existence of a
Macedonian language, which it considers a form of Bulgarian.
	   On Sunday, Bulgarian officials protested the refusal by
Macedonia to allow several Bulgarian journalists to cover the
second round of voting.

crater overflowed and sent tons of mud and rock hurtling down on
villages below. The finds boosted the death toll from former
Hurricane Mitch to 978.
	   Authorities feared that many more bodies would be found in 10
communities at the foot of the Casitas Volcano in northern
Nicaragua.
	   Mitch was one of the most violent hurricanes to hit the
Caribbean, causing heavy rain and floods as it cut a fatal path
along the coasts of Honduras, Nicaragua and other Central American
countries.
	   The first army rescue helicopters to reach the volcano on Sunday
found widespread destruction, army spokesman Capt. Milton Sandoval
said. Rescue workers recovered 360 bodies in four villages near
Posoltega, about 50 miles (80 kms) northwest of Managua.
	   A river of mud and rubble collapsed on the villages Friday after
a crater lake near the volcano's peak overflowed and caused part of
the mountain to crumble, Sandoval said.
	   Only 92 of the estimated 2,000 area residents were found alive,
some injured, and the remainder were listed as missing, Sandoval
said.
	   Rescuers aboard the first army helicopters to reach the
communities found hundreds of decomposing bodies, he said. One
hundred soldiers working at the scene were burying the rotting
bodies of the victims where they lay because of public health
concerns, Sandoval said.
	   It was unclear whether any residents of the villages of El
Porvenir, Versalles, Rolando Rodriguez and Santa Narcisa had fled
in time to avoid the mudslide or all were asleep in their homes
when it struck.
	   A woman who claimed to have survived the disaster told Radio
Nicaragua on Sunday that she had seen ``many unburied bodies'' in
orchards near the volcano.
	   The survivor, Mercedes Rodriguez Zapata, claimed to have left
the area Saturday and traveled on foot and horseback to the
capital, Managua.
	   Unconfirmed radio reports said as many as 4,000 people may have
died when mudslides struck in the northwestern province of
Chinandega.
	   The newspaper El Nuevo Diario on Sunday called Mitch's death
toll ``apocalyptic'' and said it may be the country's worst natural
disaster since a magnitude-6.2 earthquake killed 5,000 people in
1972.
	   By official count, 225 people have been killed in Nicaragua
alone from heavy rain and flash flooding _ apparently in addition
to the 360 dead in Posoltega _ for a total of 585. Another 253
people were listed as missing, the National Civil Defense reported.
	   Nicaragua has asked the United States to lend it several large
helicopters to help deliver supplies and assess damage in remote
areas, Defense Minister Pedro J. Chamorro Barrios said Saturday.
	   In Honduras, at least 231 deaths have been blamed on Mitch, the
National Emergency Commission said Saturday.
	   El Salvador _ where 140 people died in flash floods _ declared a
state of emergency Saturday, as did Guatemala, where 21 people died
when floods swept away their homes. Mexico reported one death from
Mitch last Monday.
	   In the Caribbean, the U.S. Coast Guard widened a search for a
tourist schooner with 31 people aboard that hasn't been heard from
since Tuesday.
	   By late Sunday, Mitch's winds, once near 180 mph (290 kph), had
dropped to near 30 mph (50 kph), and the storm _ now classified as
a tropical depression _ was near Tapachula, on Mexico's southern
Pacific coast near the Guatemalan border.
	   Mitch was moving west at 8 mph (13 kph) and was dissipating but
threatened to strengthen again if it moved back out to sea.

Macedonians finish second, final round of parliamentary elections

<TEXT>
	   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) _ An opposition coalition Sunday claimed
the lead over Macedonia's ruling former Communists in preliminary,
unofficial results from parliamentary elections.
	   But the country's ethnic Albanians could determine the new
government, an outcome that could affect NATO's verification
mission in neighboring Kosovo.
	   About 44 percent of the 1.5 million voters in the former
Yugoslav republic cast ballots Sunday. First results in the
election, the second and final round of balloting, were not
expected before Monday.
	   Macedonian television reported that the opposition was claiming
it had won a total of 38 seats in the 120-member parliament after
both Sunday's balloting and the first round Oct. 18. The ethnic
Albanian party claimed 24 seats, followed by the ruling Social
Democrats claiming 23, the Liberals with four and the Socialists
with one.
	   The remaining 29 seats were either too close to call or no
reports were available, television said. All figures were based on
claims by the parties themselves, who have poll watchers at each
counting station.
	   National election officials would not confirm any of the
figures.
	   If neither the opposition nor the ruling Social Democrats wins
an outright majority, the ethnic Albanian party will likely
determine which group ends up at the head of a new coalition
government.
	   NATO wants to use Macedonia as a base for its aerial
surveillance of the province and station a security force to
protect the 2,000-member ground verification force in Kosovo, a
province of the Yugoslav republic of Serbia.
	   But the opposition had questioned whether Macedonia should
become involved, even indirectly, in the Kosovo crisis.
	   During the election campaign, the opposition coalition said it
opposed the stationing of foreign military forces in Macedonia.
After the first round, however, it appeared to soften that
position, saying it would maintain ``continuity'' in international
agreements reached by the current government.
	   The main issues were Macedonia's weak economy and disputes with
neighbors Bulgaria, Albania and Greece. The average monthly salary
is dlrs 210, and unemployment is at 30 percent.
	   Macedonia declared independence from Yugoslavia six years ago,
the only former republic to have done so without a war. But
tensions are high due to a large ethnic Albanian community and a
border with Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians have been fighting for
independence.
	   Ethnic Albanians make up 23 percent of Macedonia's 2.2 million
people.

Twenty-Two candidates run again for Bucharest mayor
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with incumbent in runoff &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ The incumbent and the director of the
city hospital are expected to face each other next week in a second
runoff for mayor of Bucharest, election officials said Sunday.
	   Mayor Viorel Lis and Sorin Oprescu finished ahead of 20 other
contenders for the post. Lis led with 45.6 percent of the vote,
well ahead of Oprescu with 26.3 percent but short of the required
50 percent.
	   They will face each other Sunday in a second runoff. Turnout
Sunday was about 35 percent, officials said.
	   The private and state television stations urged people to vote,
offering prizes to those who could prove they cast ballots.
	   ``I doubt the voters' presence will be more consistent today.
The enthusiasm manifested at the election in 1996 decreased
substantially due to the people's financial hardships,''
sociologist Alin Teodorescu said by telephone.
	   Teodorescu, who runs a respected poll institution, predicted
also that many of those who voted last week will not bother to do
so again.
	   The elections held last week cost the cashed-strapped city
budget lei 14 billion (almost dlrs 1.5 million). Many Bucharest
residents see this as a waste of money in a city plagued by housing
problems, pollution and poor infrastructure.
	   The ballot became necessary when Bucharest's last elected mayor
Victor Ciorbea became prime minister in 1996. He resigned from that
job in April, quitting the post of mayor at the same time.
	   Lis was Ciorbea's deputy and has been running the city since
April.

A champion's hard, painful marathon
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BOB GREENE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Her stomach ailing and her strength weakening,
Tegla Loroupe knew there would be no record this day. In fact, she
wondered if she would even get through the race.
	   ``I had a lot of pain,'' the tiny Kenyan runner said Sunday
after finishing third in the NYC Marathon. ``At five kilometers I
started to feel my stomach.
	   ``At 20 kilometers, I wanted to pull out. Then I decided to slow
down.''
	   Loroupe holds the women's marathon record of 2 hours, 20
minutes, 47 seconds, set in April in Rotterdam, Netherlands. On
Sunday, she was in for a much harder afternoon.
	   She moved right to the lead at the start, leading the women
through the first mile (kilometer). That began a battle with
eventual winner Franca Fiacconi of Italy that lasted nearly every
step through the five boroughs of New York.
	   Mile after mile (Kilometer after kilometer), the 4-foot-11
(1.5-meter), 83-pound (38-kilogram) Kenyan matched strides with
Fiaconni. Through Brooklyn and Queens and into Manhattan they ran,
neither seemingly capable of pulling away.
	   Occasionally, Loroupe would drop back, sometimes as much as 30
yards (meters) off the staccato pace of Fiacconi. But the 1994 NYC
Marathon champion would surge back, moving in front or a step or
two behind.
	   ``I fell behind by 20 meters,'' she said. ``I had cramps and a
lot of pain.''
	   When she won in New York in her debut, she was 21, the youngest
to capture the NYC Marathon. She repeated her triumph the following
year despite record cold temperatures.
	   Since then, she has found nothing but trouble on the streets of
New York.
	   In 1996, she ran a record-breaking 1:11:4 in the opening of the
marathon, a pace she later said was much too fast. Last year, she
ran too slow for the first 13 1/2 miles (22 kilometers), then was
also hit by cramps. Both years she finished in seventh place.
	   Loroupe was in front after 21 miles (34 kilometers), but when
Fiacconi stepped up the pace in the 22nd mile (35th kilometer), the
Kenyan failed to go with her. When they passed the 23rd mile (37th
kilometer), Loroupe was third. Adriana Fernandez of Mexico, keeping
up a steady pace, had moved past her into second.
	   They finished that way, Fiacconi timed in 2:25:17, Fernandez in
2:26:33 and Loroupe in 2:30:28.
	   Still, Loroupe wasn't discouraged.
	   ``The race was good,'' she said. ``I did run a good race.''

	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ A Brazilian man who won the
lottery only to have his girlfriend vanish with the cash three days
later is suing to get the money back, a newsweekly reported Sunday.
	   Taxi driver Aloisio Rocha deposited the dlrs 4.7 million he won
in the bank account of washerwoman Francisca de Jesus in March 1997
to stop his estranged wife from getting a share of the prize, Veja
magazine reported.
	   But almost immediately, Jesus left the town of Piata, about
1,000 miles (1,600 kms) northeast of Rio, with all the winnings.
	   At the first court hearing, Rocha turned down her settlement
offer of dlrs 62,000, the newsweekly said. At the second hearing
last week, she failed to turn up, saying she was sick.
	   ___
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ United States agents who conducted an
undercover money-laundering sting are to be prosecuted, the El
Nacional newspaper reported Sunday.
	   Venezuela is to lodge a formal protest with the United States
over the operation and file charges against the agents for
violating national sovereignty laws, Pedro Luis Echeverria,
Venezuela's ambassador to Washington, told the newspaper.
	   The undercover operation, the largest drug-money laundering case
in U.S. history, resulted in the arrest of 167 people and the
seizure of (dlrs) 110 million.
	   The three-year operation focused on Mexico, though four
Venezuelan banks also were charged.
	   The indictments were unsealed last May, and set off protests
among Mexican officials who said they were not informed of the
operation.
	   Officials at the U.S. Embassy in Caracas were not available for
comment Sunday.
	   ___
	   LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) _ Mechanical failure appears to have caused
a helicopter crash that killed five Americans and one Canadian en
route to a hunting cabin in the tropical lowlands of Santa Cruz, an
investigator said Sunday.
	   The Alouette 3 helicopter was carrying five petroleum executives
_ four from the United States and one from Canada _ when it crashed
Saturday in the middle of a sunflower field
	   All five were killed along with their American pilot.
Eyewitnesses said the helicopter spun out of control, crashed and
broke apart about 65 miles (100 kms) east of Santa Cruz.
	   The helicopter was owned by rental company Helibol, which serves
the region's petroleum and natural gas companies.
	   Armando Cubillo, head of maintenance at Helibol, said initial
investigations indicate the helicopter crashed due to mechanical
failure. Investigators were trying to determine the exact cause of
the crash.
	   Chaco S.A., which is owned by the Chicago-based Amoco,
identified the victims as: Americans Chris Wright, planning manager
for Chaco S.A.; Steve Gruber, general manager of Western Atlas;
Woody Clark, general manager of Veritas D.G.C. Land; John Smatla, a
consultant for Pluspetrol; and Canadian Robert Boyd, general
manager of Destiny. John Freeouf, the American pilot, was employed
by Helibol.

 &UR; Britain to publish guide on adopting euro &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) _ Stepping up declared enthusiasm for
Europe's single currency, Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown
said Monday the Labor Party government will publish in January a
step-by-step plan on how Britain can adopt the unit.
	   The publication will coincide with the adoption of the currency,
the euro, by 11 of the 15 members of the European Union. Britain
will become the largest EU country to retain a national currency.
	   ``This government has decisively and unambiguously put this
country on a new road of constructive engagement,'' said Brown, the
treasury chief. ``For the first time we are committed in principle
to EMU (European monetary union).''
	   The text of Brown's remarks to a meeting of the Confederation of
British Industry in this central England city was released in
advance.
	   The Labor government's policy is to see how the euro works and
if it appears to be going well to hold a referendum soon after the
next national elections, which must be held by 2002.
	   ``We have committed our country to full preparations that will
allow us to make a decision, subject to a referendum, early in the
next Parliament,'' said Brown. ``Our strategy is to prepare and
then decide.''
	   The government has already changed laws to allow British
companies to pay taxes, file accounts and issues shares in the euro
from next year. The treasury also plans a controversial 7 million
pound (dlrs 12 billion) advertizing campaign aimed at showing small
and medium-sized businesses how to get ready for the euro.
	   The main opposition Conservative Party, which would rule out
adopting the euro for nearly a decade and perhaps longer, said
Labor was trying to drop the pound by stealth.
	   ``They do not think they can win the argument head on in a
referendum, so they are trying to do it through the back door by
signing up multinational businesses who they think are less
committed to retention of sterling,'' said the party's trade
spokesman, John Redwood.

	   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) _ Rescue workers recovered hundreds of
bodies Sunday from communities buried when a lake in a volcano
crater overflowed and sent tons of mud and rock hurtling down on
villages below. The finds boosted the death toll from former
Hurricane Mitch to 978.
	   Authorities feared that many more bodies would be found in 10

	   The extent of Mitch's damage elsewhere also appeared to be
widespread.
	   Army rescue helicopters on Sunday morning lifted 52 famished and
ailing men, women and children out of San Francisco Libre, on the
northern banks of Managua Lake, about 25 miles (40 km) north of the
capital. In that community alone, 1,600 families were left
homeless.
	   Candido Mejia, 58, was so weak that he could barely give his
name after he and his two children were airlifted out of the town
using rope harnesses.
	   Inhabitants said they had to climb up into trees and on the
roofs of their houses last week when the lake's edge expanded by 3
kilometers (2 miles) and flooded the farming town. No deaths were
reported, but many people had not eaten for days.
	   Rescue workers left behind provisions of rice, corn, beans,
cooking oil and milk before taking the sick to get medical care.
	   It was unclear how many other towns across Nicaragua were left
in similar circumstances.

Guerrillas besiege jungle capital, cutting off 100 police officers

	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Several hundred leftist rebels attacked
a remote state capital near the Brazilian border before dawn
Sunday, killing at least four police officers, wounding seven and
cutting off communications, the army said.
	   The guerrillas of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or
FARC, the country's oldest and largest rebel band, besieged the
police garrison in Mitu, capital of Vaupes state, where 100
officers were stationed. Using modified propane gas cylinders, they
fired homemade missiles on the base, and fighting raged in the
southeastern town all day.
	   The deputy national police commander, Gen. Luis Ernesto
Gilibert, said radio contact with the besieged base was lost Sunday
afternoon and that he expected reinforcements to be in town by
dusk.
	   Warplanes and Blackhawk helicopters were sent to aid the
besieged police officers, he said.
	   An army spokesman, Capt. Orlando Castano, said four officers
were confirmed dead and seven wounded. The death toll was expected
to rise, however, and it was feared that dozens of police could
have been captured.

Denver defeats Cincinnati 33-26
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CINCINNATI (AP) _ John Elway led Denver to three fourth-quarter
touchdowns Sunday as the Denver Broncos rallied to beat the
Cincinnati Bengals 33-26 and remain the NFL's only unbeaten team.
	   The defending Super Bowl champions (8-0) added to the best start
in franchise history by turning to its best duo in the last 16
years _ Elway and the fourth quarter.
	   Terrell Davis ran 2 yards for a touchdown and Elway converted
Vaughn Hebron's blocked punt into a 25-yard touchdown pass to Ed
McCaffrey only 2:01 later.
	   The Bengals (2-6) then tied the game at 26 with Neil O'Donnell's
third touchdown pass, a 1-yard throw to Marco Battaglia, and a
2-point conversion.
	   Elway needed only five plays to cover 53 yards and set up Davis'
5-yard touchdown run with 58 seconds left. Davis finished with 149
yards on 27 carries.
 &UR; Bucs 27, Vikings 24 &QC; 
	   In Tampa, Florida, Tampa Bay broke out of an offensive funk with
a team-record 246 yards rushing and beat the NFC's last unbeaten
team 27-24 on Mike Alstott's 6-yard touchdown run with 5:48 to go.
	   Alstott ran for a career-high 128 yards on 19 carries and
Warrick Dunn gained 115 on 18 attempts, giving Tampa Bay (4-4) two
100-yard runners in a game for the first time in franchise history.
	   Randall Cunningham was outstanding in defeat for Minnesota
(7-1), completing 21 of 25 passes for 291 yards and two
touchdowns.
 &UR; Bills 30, Dolphins 24 &QC; 
	   In Orchard Park, New York, Steve Christie kicked three field
goals, two in the last two minutes, to cap a Doug Flutie-led
comeback from a 10-point fourth-quarter deficit.
	   Flutie, who was 15-of-26 for 206 yards and three touchdowns,
threw a 48-yard touchdown to Eric Moulds and Christie kicked the
tiebreaking and an insurance field goal.
	   Dan Marino nearly succeeded in winning the game after Christie's
25-yarder made it 30-24. John Avery returned the kickoff to the
Buffalo 45 and Marino's desperation pass to O.J. McDuffie was
completed 4 yards short of the end zone.
	   That gave the Bills their fifth straight win, four engineered by
Flutie, leaving both teams at 5-3 in a tie atop the AFC East.
 &UR; Redskins 21, Giants 14 &QC; 
	   In Landover, Maryland, Trent Green, Stephen Davis and Skip Hicks
_ all inexperienced backups at the start of the season _ led
Washington to its first victory of the season.
	   Hicks carried five times for 50 yards, including a 4-yard TD run
in the opening drive of the second half to give the Redskins (1-7)
a 21-7 lead. Davis, forced to play fullback after a season-ending
injury to Larry Bowie four weeks ago, caught five passes for 65
yards, including a 12-yard touchdown.
	   And Green, re-promoted after Gus Frerotte's dismal game two
weeks ago, was 21-of-31 for 225 yards and scored the Redskins first
touchdown on a 1-yard bootleg.
	   The Giants (3-5) punted 11 times, scoring on a 90-yard kickoff
return by David Patten and an 11-yard pass from Danny Kanell to Ike
Hilliard.
 &UR; Panthers 31, Saints 17 &QC; 
	   In Charlotte, North Carolina, Steve Beuerlein threw for 132
yards and two touchdowns as Carolina won its first game.
	   Beuerlein, making his fourth start in place of outcast Kerry
Collins, completed 13 of 17 passes for the Panthers (1-7), who
snapped a nine-game losing streak. He threw scoring passes of 31
yards to Raghib Ismail and 1 yard to Muhsin Muhammad.
	   Collins, the Panthers' former No. 1 draft choice who was cut
last month after reportedly saying he no longer had the heart to
play, watched on the sidelines as the backup for New Orleans (4-4).
	   Lame-duck Billy Joe Tolliver, who will be replaced by Collins on
Nov. 15, completed 23 of 43 passes for 307 yards and two
touchdowns, but he was intercepted twice.
 &UR; Jaguars 45, Ravens 19 &QC; 
	   In Baltimore, Jacksonville broke its two-game losing streak with
a vengeance, scoring six touchdowns in the first half against
bumbling Ravens.
	   The Jaguars led 42-13 at halftime after getting three touchdowns
off Baltimore fumbles and another on a blocked punt. The Ravens
(2-6) had more yardage and held the ball twice as long as
Jacksonville (6-2) in the first half, yet committed five turnovers.
	   Mark Brunell was 13-for-20 for 237 yards and three touchdowns.
Fred Taylor scored twice and finished with 87 rushing yards.
 &UR; Oilers 41, Steelers 31 &QC; 
	   In Pittsburgh, Tennessee made up for a decade of frustration in
Three Rivers Stadium by beating the Steelers behind Steve McNair's
three touchdown passes and Eddie George's 153 yards rushing.
	   The Oilers (4-4) led 41-15 until Mike Tomczak replaced Kordell
Stewart in the fourth quarter and led two touchdown drives. The
Steelers (5-3) lost at home for the first time in 11 games and only
second time since 1989 against the Oilers.
	   George ran consistently at the injured-depleted right side of
Pittsburgh's defense and had 101 yards by halftime. He added a
37-yard scoring run that put the Oilers up 27-7 in the third
quarter.
 &UR; Patriots 21, Colts 16 &QC; 
	   In Indianapolis, Drew Bledsoe burned Jeff Burris on a 63-yard
touchdown pass to Tony Simmons as New England beat the Colts.
	   Burris was also called for two pass interference penalties that
set up touchdowns for the Patriots (5-3).
	   Peyton Manning completed a season-high 30 passes for 278 for the
Colts, including two touchdown passes. But the last two
Indianapolis drives ended with interceptions by Lawyer Milloy,
Manning's NFL-high 15th and 16th.
 &UR; Falcons 37, Rams 15 &QC; 
	   In Atlanta, Jamal Anderson rushed for a career-high 172 yards
and scored three touchdowns and Chris Chandler, sidelined last week
by a shoulder injury, threw for 236 yards and two scores for
Atlanta.
	   Chandler's presence made a big impact even though he completed
just 12 of 27 passes and threw an interception that Ryan McNeil
returned 37 yards for a touchdown for St. Louis (2-6).
	   But he also had a 9-yard scoring pass to Anderson and an
18-yarder to Tony Martin as the Falcons (6-2) bounced back from a
28-3 loss to the Jets last week.

Macedonians finish second, final round of parliamentary elections
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with two unofficial counts showing opposition close to
absolute majority &QL; 
 &UR; By KONSTANTIN TESTORIDES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) _ An opposition coalition appeared poised
to oust the ruling party of former Communists, according to
unofficial results from Sunday's second round of parliamentary
elections.
	   The outcome could affect NATO's verification mission in
neighboring Kosovo since the opposition alliance has opposed
allowing NATO troops in the country.
	   Official results from the balloting Sunday and the first round
Oct. 18 were not expected until Monday. But unofficial tallies
released by both the opposition and the ruling Social Democrats
indicated a new government was likely.
	   The opposition claimed it had won 59 of the 120 seats, followed
by the Social Democrats with 29, an ethnic Albanian group with 24
and three small parties with a total of seven. One seat had been
contested for undisclosed irregularities.
	   The Social Democrat count, also reported by Macedonian
television, had the opposition with 57 seats, followed by the
ruling party with 31, the ethnic Albanians with 24 and the others
divided among the small parties.
	   If the official figures are similar, it would appear the
opposition would have little trouble attracting the few seats
needed for the required 61-seat majority.
	   All figures were based on claims by the parties themselves, who
have poll watchers at each counting station. Earlier unofficial
results had shown the opposition ahead, but so far from a majority
that the ethnic Albanians could determine the next government.

New York Marathon attracts runners from around the world
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos &QL; 
 &UR; By DIEGO IBARGUEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ If New York actually is, as some say, the
capital of the world, proof could be found at this year's New York
City Marathon. Over one-third of the 32,000 runners in this year's
marathon were foreign entrants, according to race organizers.
	   ``It adds to the lively nature. It makes it more of a world
class event when you have international representation,'' said
Steve Boland, a spokesman for the New York Road Runners Club, which
stages the race. Boland said 11,000 runners from 94 different
countries decided it was worth the trip to run the 26.2-mile
(42.16-kilometer) course through the city Sunday.
	   The race was won by John Kagwe of Kenya, while Franca Fiacconi
became the first Italian to win the women's division.
	   ``There are a lot of hills, especially in the last four miles.
... (International runners) can really prove themselves here,''
said Edgar Cuesta, one of hundreds of volunteer translators for the
race. Cuesta came from Bogota, Colombia, to help translate for
runners.
	   Chilean runner Victor Belmar, 41, who finished his second New
York marathon Sunday, said ``I think it's the people. ... They
stand on the sides all along the course and cheer you on. It's true
confraternity. It gives you motivation.''
	   Many take part despite major disabilities, including 31-year-old
Norwegian runner Ketil Moe, who had a double lung transplant last
year.
	   ``We usually don't see those people here,'' said Janice Moran, a
physical therapist stationed near mile 24 (kilometer 39). ``They
just keep on going.''
	   Fans lined the course for the final miles (kilometers) in
Central Park, many of them immigrants who have made a new home in
New York.
	   Adolfo Garcia, who moved here from Spain seven years ago, enjoys
watching the final stages of the race in his Upper East Side
neighborhood. He said he cheers for all the runners, but especially
for the Spaniards.
	   Many runners wore their national colors in the form of small
flags, headbands, and in a few cases, dyed hair. And fans waved
their own flags to urge on their compatriots.
	   A few hundred yards (meters) from the finish line, onlookers
were out in force. Runners with their names on their shirts got
personalized cheers. But the loudest cheers came when a runner
slowed up or seemed unable to go on.
	   Some finishers walked straight out of the park, either going
home or waiting for fellow runners.
	   Lorentz Gerard of France sat on a park bench at the West 72
Street entrance wrapped in foil to keep him warm. He said the fans
are what makes this race special.
	   ``This is the only marathon I know that is like this,'' he said.
``There are so many people cheering you on.''
	   Authorities reported 48 injuries in the race, only a handful
requiring hospital care, and none of the injuries were life
threatening. Police reported no incidents.

Israel to lift closure of Palestinian areas
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel will lift its 50-day closure of the
Palestinian territories on Monday morning, allowing some 60,000
laborers to reach jobs inside the country, an army spokesman said
Sunday.
	   All married Palestinian laborers above the age of 23 who have no
record of anti-Israeli activities will be allowed into Israel, said
Shlomo Dror.
	   In addition, some 21,000 Palestinian business people will be
permitted in and restrictions on the entrance of Palestinian
produce into Israel will be eased, Dror said.
	   David Bar-Illan, an adviser to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanayhu
called the lifting a ``good will gesture.'' Monday is the first day
of implementation of the latest peace accord signed with the
Palestinian Authority.
	   Israel sealed the West Bank and Gaza Strip on September 12,
fearing retaliatory attacks after Israeli soldiers shot and killed
two fugitives of the militant Islamic group Hamas.
	   Since then Israel slightly eased the closure and then reimposed
it after five terror attacks including a suicide bombing in the
Gaza Strip last week that killed one soldier and the Palestinian
bomber.

MLS defender Caligiuri waived by Galaxy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PASADENA, California (AP) _ Defender Paul Caligiuri, whose goal
qualified the United States for the 1990 World Cup, has been waived
by the Los Angeles Galaxy of the U.S. Major League Soccer, it was
announced Sunday.
	   His most famous goal was the 35-yard (meter) dipping shot that
gave the United States a 1-0 victory over host Trinidad and Tobago
in a 1989 World Cup qualifier. It sealed the first appearance for
the United States in the World Cup since 1950.
	   Caligiuri started all three matches for the United States in the
1990 World Cup and all four in 1994.
	   Caligiuri, 34, joined the Galaxy in 1997 after an arbitrator
ruled in his favor in a breach of contract suit against the league.
Caligiuri had claimed he had been promised he would play for the
Galaxy when the league started play in 1996, and not have to move
from his home in Walnut. However, Caligiuri was not assigned to the
Galaxy, spending the inaugural season with the Columbus Crew.
	   He played in 18 matches for the Galaxy during an injury-plagued
1998 season. Foot and ankle injuries forced him to miss 11 of Los
Angeles' first 15 matches, while a strained groin kept him out of a
match in August and two in September. Caligiuri started in all four
playoff matches.

Guerrillas besiege jungle capital, cutting off 100 police officers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS lead, ADDS that no aircraft landed at town airport,
background on homemade missiles. &QL; 
 &UR; By FRANK BAJAK &QC;

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Fighting raged all day Sunday in a
remote state capital near the Brazilian border after several
hundred leftist rebels attacked a police base before dawn, killing
at least four police officers, wounding seven and cutting off
communications.
	   The guerrillas of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or
FARC, the country's oldest and largest rebel band, rained homemade
missiles on the garrison in Mitu, capital of Vaupes state, where
some 100 officers were stationed.
	   The missiles, shot from modified propane gas cylinders, were
first used in a devastating Aug. 3 assault that leveled the
Miraflores police narcotics base in the same region.
	   The deputy national police commander, Gen. Luis Ernesto
Gilibert, said radio contact with the besieged garrison had been
lost Sunday afternoon and that he expected reinforcements to be in
Mitu by dusk.
	   Warplanes and Blackhawk helicopters were sent to aid the
besieged police officers but couldn't land at the town airport,
which rebels controlled, officials said.
	   An army spokesman, Capt. Orlando Castano, said four officers
were confirmed dead and seven wounded. The death toll was expected
to rise, however, and it was feared that dozens of police could
have been captured.
	   Castano said rebels cut off telephone communications with Mitu
early Sunday evening.
	   On the Vaupes River, the Amazon Basin city has 15,000 residents
and can only be reached by air and river. Although no soldiers are
based in the city, its police post is well fortified and surrounded
by barbed wire and trenches, said Castano.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Jiri Novak of the Czech Republic won his
second ATP Tour championship with a 6-3, 6-3 victory over qualifier
Xavier Malisse on Sunday in the dlrs 315,000 Mexican Open.
	   Novak, who won his first tournament in New Zealand in 1996,
saved three break points in the second game to stay on serve, then
broke Malisse to take a 4-3 lead. Novak, who lost to Thomas Muster
in the Mexican Open finals last year, broke Malisse in the sixth
game of the second set.
	   Malisse, an 18-year-old from Belgium, was trying to become the
second qualifier to win an ATP Tour event this year. Andrew Ilie of
Australia won at Coral Springs, Florida, in May.
	   Malisse entered the tournament No. 361 in the ATP rankings and
will move inside the top 200 when the new order is released.

	   ATLANTA (AP) _ Hal Sutton put together a comeback Sunday in the
Tour Championship that was almost as gratifying as his journey back
from rock bottom in his career.
	   Sutton saved par from a bunker on the 72nd hole to force a
playoff, then hit a 4-wood within 6 feet (1.8 meters) for birdie on
the par-3 18th to beat Vijay Singh on the first extra hole and win
dlrs 720,000 from the richest purse on the PGA Tour.
	   But this was about more than just money.
	   The victory gave Sutton enough points to move into eighth place
in the Presidents Cup standings, earning him a berth on the U.S.
team for the biennial matches against an International team next
month in Australia.

Snyder wins Bell Challenge
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   QUEBEC (AP) _ Seventh-seeded Tara Snyder saved two match points
in the third set then won the tiebreaker over fifth-seeded Chanda
Rubin on Sunday to win the Bell Challenge for her first WTA Tour
title.
	   Snyder, 21, prevailed 4-6, 6-4, 7-6 (8-6) in the all-U.S. final.
	   ``I was just praying near the end, it was so close,'' Snyder
said. ``It was such a rush of adrenaline and when I hit the last
shot, it was great.''
	   Snyder trailed 5-4 in the third set after losing three
consecutive games, and three consecutive forehand errors gave Rubin
her first match point. But Snyder, with a service winner, brought
the game to deuce. Later in the game, she hit a backhand down the
line to save the second match point.
	   Snyder then rallied from a 5-3 deficit in the tiebreak, taking
advantage of a missed call on a forehand that appeared to be long
on the next point.
	   ``That's a case of somebody not doing what they're supposed
to,'' Rubin said. ``It definitely bothered me. I tried to be
aggressive but she played better shots from then on.''
	   Snyder forced an error by Rubin at 6-6 after running down an
overhead and then laced a backhand down the line to close out the
match.
	   ``I've always been able to concentrate and that's something that
I've always had in my favor,'' Snyder said. ``And that's what
separates the top 20, is mental toughness. I've always prided
myself on being mentally tough. I tried to be aggressive.''
	   Snyder, who collected dlrs 27,000, started off the year ranked
120th in the world but entered the Bell Challenge at No. 45.
	   ``When I started off the year, I wanted to get into the top
100,'' she said. ``After I did that, I set my sights on the top 50.
Now, I want to go even further. I don't want to go for No. 1, but
for the top 20. I still want to do things step-by-step.''

Trial of Malaysia's most famous dissident begins

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ He was once Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad's protege and heir apparent. Now he's Malaysia's
most famous dissident.
	   As Anwar Ibrahim prepared to go on trial Monday, riot police
braced for new protests around Kuala Lumpur's federal courthouse
and in the capital's downtown area. Demonstrations have been held
regularly in the city since Anwar's arrest on Sept. 20.
	   Judge Augustine Paul was scheduled to hear arguments Monday on
four counts of corruption and one of sodomy against Anwar. A
separate trial is expected for one more count of abuse of power and
four more of illegal sex.
	   The prosecution plans to bring in 52 witnesses in the first
round of the hearing, which is scheduled to last until Nov. 14. At
that time, the court will break for more than one week during a
meeting of 20 world leaders at an Asia-Pacific trade forum.
	   The huge international attention on the case and its wide
implications for Malaysian politics forced authorities to shift the
hearing from the High Court building to a large room in the
adjacent federal courthouse.
	   Anwar's dismissal and his arrest has led to unprecedented public
demonstrations against Mahathir and focused attention on the issues
of political dissent, freedom of expression and human rights in
Malaysia.
	   Although the government has said it would not accord special
privileges to international jurists and human rights observers,
dozens are expected to attend the trial.
	   In Melbourne, Australia, a prominent lawyers' group urged the
government to guarantee a fair trial for Anwar. The Law Council of
Australia also called on the government not to impede the work of
international observers attending the trial.
	   The judge had initially ruled that the trial would be conducted
in English because of the wide interest. But last week, the chief
justice ordered the trial to be conducted in Bhasa, the language of
majority Malays.
	   The room in the federal courthouse was also selected because it
has an underground tunnel connecting it to the lockup, and Anwar is
likely to be sneaked in through the tunnel, the Sun newspaper
reported.
	   When Anwar was arrested, thrown in jail and allegedly roughed up
by police, many people began to question the criminal case and
rally to Anwar's side. Last weekend, a demonstration in the capital
turned into a full-scale riot, the first in nearly three decades by
a normally placid people.
	   Anwar denies the 10 charges against him. Mahathir, 72, who has
ruled Malaysia for 17 years, says he fired his deputy prime
minister on moral grounds because homosexual acts are illegal in
Muslim-majority Malaysia.
	   Anwar, 51, could be jailed for a maximum of 14 years for each of
the corruption charges linked to abusing his power as Malaysia's
deputy prime minister from 1993 until his dismissal on Sept. 2.
Each sodomy charge carries a maximum sentence of 20 years
imprisonment and a fine.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) _ Rescue workers recovered hundreds of
bodies Sunday from communities buried when a lake in a volcano
crater overflowed and sent tons of mud and rock hurtling down on
villages below. The finds boosted the death toll from former
Hurricane Mitch to 978. Authorities feared that many more bodies
would be found in 10 communities at the foot of the Casitas Volcano
in northern Nicaragua. Mitch was one of the most violent hurricanes
to hit the Caribbean, causing heavy rain and floods as it cut a
fatal path along the coasts of Honduras, Nicaragua and other
Central American countries. (TROPICAL WEATHER-MITCH)
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Israel and the Palestinians are to begin
implementing the latest Mideast peace accord Monday with the
completion of a Palestinian security document. Israel said it was
lifting a 50-day blockade on Palestinian areas and in a move
described by a senior Israeli official as a ``good-will gesture,''
would open its borders again to some 60,000 Palestinian laborers
who rely on menial jobs in Israel. David Bar-Illan, a senior
adviser to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said Israel was
waiting for the Palestinian document before beginning a promised
troop withdrawal from parts of the West Bank. In return for the
withdrawal, the Palestinians have pledged to crack down on Islamic
militants. (ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS)
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe said
on Sunday that his troops and their southern African allies would
step up their attacks on Congo rebels. He also criticized U.S.
efforts to broker a peace agreement. Mugabe, after a summit with
Congolese President Laurent Kabila and officials from military
allies Angola and Namibia in the southeastern Congolese town of
Lubumbashi, said the allies were launching an offensive ``to clear
the enemy'' from Congolese territory. U.S. Assistant Secretary of
State for Africa Susan Rice is scheduled to visit Zimbabwe on
Monday. Rice is on a regional shuttle to press for peace
negotiations and the withdrawal of foreign troops from Congo.
Mugabe criticized Rice for comparing his country's involvement in
Congo ``with invaders and aggressors.'' (ZIMBABWE-CONGO)
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The trial begins Monday of Anwar
Ibrahim, once Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's protege and heir
apparent, but now Malaysia's most famous dissident. Amid tight
security around Kuala Lumpur's federal courthouse, Judge Augustine
Paul was scheduled to hear arguments on four counts of corruption
and one of sodomy. A separate trial is expected for one more count
of abuse of power and four more of illegal sex. Riot police braced
for new protests around the courthouse and in downtown Kuala
Lumpur, where demonstrations have been held regularly since Anwar's
Sept. 20 arrest. (MALAYSIA-ANWAR TRIAL)
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Fighting raged all day Sunday in a
remote state capital near the Brazilian border after several
hundred leftist rebels attacked a police base before dawn, killing
at least four police officers, wounding seven and cutting off
communications. The guerrillas of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia, or FARC, the country's oldest and largest rebel band,
rained homemade missiles on the garrison in Mitu, capital of Vaupes
state, where some 100 officers were stationed. The deputy national
police commander, Gen. Luis Ernesto Gilibert, said radio contact
with the besieged garrison had been losted Sunday afternoon and
that he expected reinforcements to arrive by dusk.

	   SUZUKA, Japan (AP) _ Mika Hakkinen now has experienced the best
and the worst of Formula One driving.
	   The 30-year-old Finn, who many thought would never return from a
near-fatal crash three years ago, clinched his first Formula One
championship Sunday with a victory in the Japanese Grand Prix.
	   Hakkinen started the season finale in the first position after
rival Michael Schumacher lost the pole when the engine of his
Ferrari stalled on the starting grid.
	   He led during all 51 laps on the 5.864-kilometer (3.636-mile)
Suzuka Circuit and finished 6.4 seconds ahead of Schumacher's
Ferrari teammate, Eddie Irvine. His own McLaren teammate, David
Coulthard, was third.
	   The race victory was the ninth of Hakkinen's career and capped a
breakthrough season for the popular Finn.
	   ``Since 1993, I've fought hard to win races and be world
champion. It took a long time and now it has happened,'' said
Hakkinen.
	   In the 1995 crash in Australia, a blown rear tire sent
Hakkinen's car skidding into the wall at more than 192 kph (120
mph). He suffered a fractured skull and was in danger of drowning
in his own blood.
	   Track doctors saved his life by performing an emergency
tracheotomy.
	   Hakkinen said the struggle to recover from the injuries made him
a better driver.
	   ``It changed my life dramatically,'' he said. ``But I learned
you just have to believe in yourself.''
	   Hakkinen went into Sunday's race the favorite for the driver's
title. And claiming the crown was all but assured after Schumacher,
who qualified first Saturday, was forced to start from the back of
the field after his engine shut down on the second attempt to begin
the race. On the first attempt, Italy's Jarno Trulli stalled on the
grid, forcing officials to abort the start.
	   ``It's a big disappointment. You work so hard Friday, Saturday
and then you have such a tiny little problem that stalls your
engine. And you sit there and can't do anything and have to start
from the back, which is not funny,'' said Schumacher.
	   Trailing Hakkinen by four points going into the Sunday's race,
the German could have won his third title only if he passed all of
the 20 drivers ahead of him and if someone other than Hakkinen
finished second.
	   After only one lap he was 12th, and he got as far as third
position before he was forced to drop out in the 32nd lap when the
right rear tire of his car exploded.
	   ``When Michael was forced to start from the back of the grid it
raised an enormous amount of pressure from me,'' Hakkinen said.
	   ``It was easier than some of the racing has been in the past
this year,'' he added.
	   And when word came over his radio that Schumacher was out, ``it
was a situation where you nearly start singing in the car because
you know you have won the championship at that time. It was just
fun,'' Hakkinen said.
	   Hakkinen finished the season with 100 points, 14 more than
Schumacher, and led McLaren to its eighth constructor's title. He
is the second Finn to win the title, following Williams' Keke
Rosberg in 1982.
	   Coulthard was third with 56 points, and Irvine fourth with 47.
McLaren had 156 points, followed by Ferrari at 133 and Williams at
38.

Heading for Western Europe, ending up in the Czech Republic

	   VYSNI LHOTY, Czech Republic (AP) - They paid hundreds of dollars
to get to Germany, only to end up in a Czech refugee camp.
	   Now, the 90 impoverished Indians are stuck in this austere
refugee reception center 400 kilometers (250 miles) east of Prague.
They are some of the hundreds of illegal immigrants who cross Czech
borders every week, trying to reach rich countries of Western
Europe.
	   ``We boarded a Moscow-bound plane in Delhi,'' one of the Indians
said in broken English, refusing to give his name. ``On arrival,
they loaded us in a van and took us here.''
	   Asked whether he knows where he is, the Indian simply shrugs his
shoulders.
	   About 32,000 illegal aliens were caught by Czech police during
the first nine months of this year, already more than in the whole
of 1997.
	   But only a fraction of them have formally requested asylum. The
vast majority want to continue to Western Europe, which doesn't
want them either.
	   Most of the migrants arrive in the Czech Republic through the
loosely controlled eastern border with Slovakia. Many of those who
make it across end up caught on the western border with Germany,
the dreamed-of destination for a majority of them.
	   ``Czech borders are porous because we lack both border patrols
and equipment,'' police spokesman Jiri Suttner says. ``As to the
border protection, we're far behind Austria or Germany.''
	   Only a couple of hundred policemen guard the borders with
Slovakia and Germany, far too few to combat the growing number of
refugees.
	   ``People smuggling'' has become a lucrative business and the
police has virtually no way to stop it.
	   Smugglers, who operate within a number of organized gangs, are
hard to spot. They usually send a decoy first, who attracts the
attention of border guards while the smuggler leads the others
across the border along unauthorized paths.
	   If the decoy gets caught, he or she simply claims to be lost and
is set free to try to cross later.
	   Alternatively, smugglers unload their ``clients'' a couple of
miles before the hilly, often forested border, give them
approximate directions and vanish, leaving the migrants to try and
make the trip across on foot.
	   ``Me and my family were on the road for five days,'' says
Mentor, a 26-year ethnic Albanian from Kosovo. Like everyone else
at Vysni Lhoty, he refuses to give his last name, fearing his
relatives could get into trouble.
	   ``Inland, they drove us in a pick-up but on the borders, we had
to get off and walk. They unloaded us in a forest and
disappeared.'' For this ``service,'' Mentor says he paid dlrs
5,000.
	   When asked whether he wanted to come here or travel on to
Germany, he says evasively: ``Some of us wanted to go to Germany,
but I'd rather stay here, there's no difference.''
	   For smugglers, the risk is minimal. Few are ever apprehended.
Those who are arrested face only light punishment.
	   The maximum sentence in the Czech Republic for ``people
smuggling'' is three years imprisonment. But police say that since
most are first offenders, the stiffest sentence imposed recently
has been one year in jail.
	   Until recently, a loophole in the law allowed many migrants to
slip away even if they were caught. Migrants could simply ask
directions to the nearest refugee camp. Police were not required by
law to accompany them. As a result, many simply continued on their
way to the German border.
	   Last month, for example, 75 Kosovo Albanians were detained on
the German border and transported by the police to Prague's Central
Railway Station, where they were set free. Two days later, several
members of the group were again caught by border patrols.
	   ``We had nowhere to put them,'' a border policeman, Petr Jirkuv,
said. ``The jails are full, so we had to set them free.''
	   But a recent change in the law now requires police to escort
migrants to reception centers.
	   At Vysni Lhoty, located on the border with Slovakia, refugees
housed at a former Soviet army barracks receive basic health care,
food and shelter pending transfer to one of three longterm camps
for migrants.
	   Most of those here come from Afghanistan, Kosovo, India and
Iraq, according to the camp's director, Jozef Latka. The camp was
designed to house up to 300 people. It currently has about 550.
	   ``Busloads of them come here every day,'' Latka says.

	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ In a portrait taken months before they
were gunned down in a military coup, Bangladesh's founding prime
minister, his wife and their three sons face the camera with
solemnity, looking almost too typically middle class to be the
country's first family.
	   Fifteen relatives and two other people were slain when Mujibur
Rahman was assassinated Aug. 15, 1975. Only two daughters survived
the massacre, saved because they were on vacation out of the
country.
	   Today, his eldest daughter is prime minister, and she has used
her power to bring the suspected killers to trial.
	   Sheikh Hasina _ known only by the title of respect and first
name _ said in an interview that her campaign is about public
justice, not personal vengeance.
	   The trial in a stuffy makeshift courtroom in Dhaka's old quarter
also seems closely linked to her campaign to restore her father's
image. She considers him a man of the people and not, as some had
begun to argue at the time of his slaying, a potential despot for
assuming extensive powers to deal with social unrest.
	   ``I am my father's daughter, working for the people,'' she said,
sitting behind a desk facing a large oil painting of her father.
	   A poster on the iron gate that leads to her office shows a
poignant scene that never happened: Mother Teresa, that universal
symbol of compassion, at the side of a bleeding Rahman under the
Bangla-language caption: ``Let the world's conscience rise against
the hater killers of Bangabandhu, the father of the nation.''
	   Slogans extolling Bangabandhu _ ``friend of the Bangladeshi
people'' _ are everywhere in the capital these days, making up for
the years when military rulers banned any mention of Rahman from
television, radio and newspapers.
	   His toppling was the first of three coups and 19 attempted coups
in Bangladesh's 27-year history and the first of two leaders'
assassinations.
	   Sheikh Hasina, elected in 1996 in only the second Bangladeshi
election seen as free and fair, said the smooth progress of the
trial of her father's suspected killers shows democracy is at last
taking root.
	   ``If anybody does any crime, there should be a trial,'' she
said. ``Otherwise you cannot have law and order, you cannot
preserve the human rights of the people, you cannot ensure people a
safe life.''
	   On the three days a week that proceedings are held, the
defendants _ former officers Syed Farooq Rahman, Shariar Rashid
Khan, Mohiuddin Ahmed and Abdul Wahab and former junior Information
Minister Taheruddin Thakur _ are brought in together, handcuffed to
a rope. They face hanging if convicted of murder and conspiracy. A
verdict is expected this month.
	   One of Sheikh Hasina's first acts after taking office was to
revoke an amnesty granted to the coup leaders by the military
regime that succeeded her father. In addition to bringing charges
against the five defendants, her government is trying to track down
and bring back for trial 14 other suspects believed to be living in
other countries.
	   In the past, the main suspect, Syed Farooq Rahman, publicly
bragged of killing Mujibur Rahman. But in court, he and his
co-defendants pleaded innocent.
	   During a recent court session, defense attorney Abdul Razak
argued there can be no legal liability for anything done to further
martial law, a policy that was decreed five days after Rahman's
assassination but declared to be retroactive.
	   Razak's reasoning ``is against the spirit of the constitution,
it is against the soul of the constitution,'' chief prosecutor
Serajul Huq, a close friend of Rahman, fumed over tea and pastries
during a break in the trial at a military barracks being used as a
courtroom for security.
	   Huq questioned why so many people had to die if it was just a
matter of ousting Rahman. The carnage revealed the soldiers as
common, brutal criminals, he said.
	   Some speculate the coup leaders wanted to ensure no one close to
Rahman would survive to claim his mantle _ as his daughter has
done. Sheikh Hasina's younger sister, Rehana, has stayed out of
politics.
	   In addition to Rahman, soldiers killed his wife, three sons, the
wives of the two oldest sons, nine other relatives, his bodyguard
and the cousin of a leader of his Awami League party.
	   Army officers resented Rahman for awarding high military posts
to men who had campaigned with him for Bangladesh's secession from
Pakistan in 1971. Among the public, his popularity was waning amid
political and economic instability and rising crime.
	   In January 1975, Rahman gave himself wide powers, and he
declared Bangladesh a one-party state that February. Six months
later he was dead.
	   Hardened by repression under Pakistani military dictatorships
and by their bloody independence war, Bangladeshis showed little
reaction when the coup leaders announced they had killed Rahman to
save the country from tyranny.
	   Sheikh Hasina said her father was misunderstood.
	   ``He united all the political parties ... so that they could
work together for the economic emancipation of the people. To build
up a war-devastated country, the people should be united,'' she
said. ``He couldn't fulfill (his dream) before he was assassinated.
That's why still, after 27 years of liberation, people are poor,
people are suffering.''

	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ A quarter century after army officers
assassinated Bangladesh's independence leader and most of his
family, his daughter is using her power as prime minister to try to
restore his reputation.
	   For the first time, the government sponsored mourning ceremonies
last year on the Aug. 15 anniversary of Mujibir Rahman's death. A
hospital and a stadium in Dhaka were recently named after him as
was a new 4.8-kilometer (3-mile) bridge connecting western
districts to the capital.
	   Slogans and posters extolling ``Sheikh Mujib,'' as Rahman was
popularly known, decorate the capital.
	   ``I know some people may not like it, because they tried to
suppress'' the truth, Sheikh Hasina, Rahman's daughter who has been
prime minister since 1996, said in an interview. ``He liberated
this country. They cannot erase his name from people's minds.''
	   The charismatic Rahman led the breakaway campaign in what was
then East Pakistan and was elected Bangladesh's first prime
minister in 1973.
	   Months before his killing in 1975, Rahman had assumed wide
powers and declared the country a one-party state. The officers who
killed him said they were saving the country from tyranny. Sheikh
Hasina says her father planned to restore democratic rights after
restoring stability.
	   Every day, 1,000 people visit the Dhaka mansion where Rahman was
killed, says Baby Moudud, a close friend of Sheikh Hasina who has
helped run the house as a museum since it was opened to the public
in 1994.
	   Solemn visitors gaze at the tunic and glasses Rahman was wearing
when he was shot, both bearing police evidence tags. The stairwell
where his body fell is dominated by a life-size oil painting of the
slain leader.
	   ``I came to see where he was, where he was lying,'' said
businessman Mohammed Sajjadur. ``We should know this.''

Irish premier heading for Belfast to confront Northern Ireland

impasse &QL;

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Irish Prime Minister Bertie
Ahern planned to visit Belfast on Monday to try to sort out
Northern Ireland's historic but increasingly troubled peace
agreement.
	   Seven months after most local politicians accepted a system for
the province's British Protestants and Irish Catholics to share
power, the two sides have yet to form the coalition government.
	   Protestant politician David Trimble _ the would-be leader of the
new government, who jointly won this year's Nobel Peace Prize _ is
demanding that the Irish Republican Army start disarming before he
will form any government that includes Sinn Fein, the outlawed
IRA's political allies.
	   But Catholics, both moderates and IRA supporters alike, are
increasingly annoyed with Trimble because they had expected the
government to be formed weeks or months ago. They emphasize that
while the agreement envisaged IRA disarmament by mid-2000 _
something the IRA insists won't happen _ this goal wasn't an
explicit requirement for Sinn Fein's inclusion in government.
	   On Saturday, the agreement's stated deadline for the new
government to hold an inaugural summit with the Irish government
passed without progress, and Ahern confirmed he would come to
Northern Ireland's capital this week to try to break the impasse.
	   On the same day the Red Hand Defenders, a new Protestant
paramilitary group opposed to the prevailing cease-fires by other
pro-British groups, shot dead a Catholic man in north Belfast, the
first such sectarian slaying in months.
	   Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams said this week's negotiations
involving Ahern would show whether Trimble, leader of the major
British Protestant party, the Ulster Unionists, ``is prepared to
face down those who want this effort to fail.''
	   ``The excuse that in some way he's hostage or a victim of
machinations within his (Protestant) constituency, or his own
party, are totally erroneous,'' Adams told the Irish national
broadcasters RTE.
	   Adams, a reputed former IRA commander, said he couldn't deliver
a start to IRA disarmament now and he had repeatedly told Trimble
this in private meetings. He said the intervention of the Irish,
British and American governments was required to create ``any
forward movement.''
	   ``Anyone expecting unionism to do a decent deal with any brand
of nationalism or republicanism,'' Adams said in reference to the
moderate and militant wings of Catholic opinion, ``will wait for it
a very long time indeed.''
	   When pressed, Adams refused to speculate whether the current
impasse would eventually lead the IRA to abandon its July 1997
cease-fire. A previous IRA truce collapsed in 1996 after 17 months
of political stalemate.

	   TIJUANA, Mexico (AP) _ The second life of newspaper publisher
Jesus Blancornelas began after he glanced out the window of his red
Ford Explorer to see a man in a passing vehicle aiming a gun at
him.
	   Dozens of bullets tore into the Explorer. Blancornelas nearly
bled to death from four wounds. His bodyguard-driver, Luis Lauro
Valero, died.
	   ``I am now living extra hours that were given to me,'' said
Blancornelas, an intense 62-year-old with closely cropped
salt-and-pepper hair and beard. ``I arrived at the hospital almost
dead. If I had arrived five minutes later, I would not be here.''
	   But Blancornelas' second life is similar to the first. Every
week he writes the same type of hard-hitting column for the
investigative weekly Zeta that nearly got him killed.
	   Border journalists like Blancornelas run real risks exposing
gangs that move tons of cocaine and other drugs into the United
States. Last year, another newspaper publisher in the neighboring
border state of Sonora was shot to death outside his office.
	   The attack on Blancornelas last Nov. 27 has not made him any
less public.
	   When gunmen massacred eight children and 10 adults in nearby
Ensenada in a drug-related shooting in September, Blancornelas was
interviewed extensively by Mexican news media. Several weeks in a
row, he made the massacre the lead story in Zeta, which he helped
found 18 years ago.
	   ``We are working as we always did, and we are moving ahead,'' he
said. ``If I sat at home all day and did nothing, I would die.''
	   Even before he was shot, Blancornelas was widely recognized for
investigative reporting that targeted the violent Arellano Felix
brothers, who run Mexico's most powerful drug gang out of Tijuana.
	   A year before the attack, the New York-based Committee to
Protect Journalists gave him its International Press Freedom Award,
and he was named World Press Review's editor of the year early this
year.
	   Blancornelas was honored Oct. 22 with a Maria Moors Cabot Prize,
an award from Columbia University recognizing reporting that
contributes to inter-American understanding and press freedom.
	   Although praised by international journalists, Blancornelas has
plenty of enemies in Tijuana.
	   ``When I first started in journalism, we said that it was much
more dangerous to work in Mexico City,'' he said. ``That changed.''
	   Joel Simon of the Committee to Protect Journalists agreed. ``The
border now is a much riskier place for journalists. It's a place
where scores are settled and the journalism is bare-knuckles.''
	   In the Zeta issue just before Blancornelas was shot, he had
blamed David Barron Corona, a reputed lieutenant in the Arellano
Felix gang, for a machine-gun slaying of two federal agents outside
a Tijuana courthouse.
	   Barron was among the men who attacked Blancornelas, dying in the
crossfire.
	   It's just as dangerous farther east.
	   Publisher Benjamin Flores Gonzalez was murdered in July 1997
outside the daily newspaper La Prensa in the border city of San
Luis Colorado, south of Yuma, Arizona.
	   A person firing an assault rifle from a car shot Flores at least
17 times in the back, then got out and shot him three times in the
head with a pistol.
	   Flores, a member of the opposition National Action Party, had
used his column, ``Not Confirmed,'' to expose alleged drug
traffickers and to criticize the governing Institutional
Revolutionary Party.
	   Blancornelas' longtime colleague and co-founder of Zeta, Hector
``Gato'' Felix Miranda, was killed by shotgun blasts while driving
to work on April 20, 1988.
	   Every week since, Zeta has published a full-page notice signed
by Felix Miranda, whose criticisms of local politicians made him
one of the best known and most hated journalists on the border.
	   ``Jorge Hank Rhon: why did your bodyguard Antonio Vera Palestina
kill me?'' the notice asks the wealthy owner of Tijuana's
Aguacaliente racetrack.
	   Although Vera and another racetrack employee were convicted in
Felix Miranda's slaying, Blancornelas contends Hank Rhon was never
seriously investigated because his father, Carlos Hank Gonzalez, is

Honduran mayor dies in plane crash
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ The mayor of Tegucigalpa, Cesar
Castellanos, was among four people killed Sunday when a helicopter
crashed in Honduras' capital city.
	   Castellanos had spent the day overseeing recovery efforts
following the devastation caused by Tropical Storm Mitch. The storm
caused massive flooding, destroyed houses and bridges and left
thousands of people homeless.
	   Official figures now list nine people killed in the city, but
the death toll could be in the hundreds as waters recede and bodies
are found.
	   Also killed in the crash were two crew members and the mayor's
official cameraman, local television reported.
	   The cause of the crash was uncertain. About the time of the
crash, clear skies had given way to late afternoon showers.
	   News of the crash stunned Hondurans, still reeling from the
storm that battered the entire country and killed at least 231
people in Honduras and more than 970 people throughout Central
America.
	   Castellanos was a popular politician seen as a likely candidate
for the presidency in the 2001 elections.
	   He was elected mayor in December as a candidate for the
opposition National Party.
	   In an effort to combat rising crime by gangs, Castellanos
imposed a curfew on anyone found on city streets without an adult
after 11 p.m.

Paris commuters face another day of transport chaos
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Strike scheduled to begin at 0330 GMT. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Commuters in the Paris region faced another day of
chaos Monday with trains, buses and the Metro on strike in the
latest protest against violent attacks on transport officials.
	   The 24-hour walkout was scheduled to begin at 4;30 a.m. (0330
GMT), and transport workers planned to rally at the Finance
Ministry to demand better security measures, and more staff.
	   The Metro and buses were expected to come to a complete halt, as
were two of four lines on the Regional Express Network (RER) which
serves the suburbs _ including the B line which serves Charles de
Gaulle airport.
	   The government has deployed CRS elite police on trains and buses
in recent weeks, and Prime Minister Lionel Jospin has promised to
revise the penal code to deal more harshly with violence against
transport workers.
	   But there has been no end to attacks.
	   In the latest violence, two armed men in the southern city of
Marseille tied up a bus driver at a depot's administrative office
Sunday and made off with about 200,000 francs (dlrs 33,000). Bus
drivers in northern Marseille immediately went on a 24-hour strike.
	   Marseille bus drivers also walked off the job briefly on Friday
after an attack on a driver by a commuter who wanted to get off
between regular stops.
	   The rising crime is blamed on youths from working class suburbs,
who've been hit hard by double-digit unemployment. While the
national jobless rate is 11.7 percent, the rate can top 50 percent
in some neighborhoods.

Iraq refuses to renew cooperation with arms inspectors

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Unless the U.N. Security Council begins to
lift devastating trade sanctions, Iraq will not renew cooperation
with weapons inspectors, even if threatened with military action,
officials said.
	   Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan said Sunday that ``there will
be no cooperation before Iraq's demands are met.''
	   The statements were the first Iraqi response to the U.N.
Security Council's condemnation of Baghdad's decision Saturday to
ban U.N. weapons inspectors from working in the country.
	   In Washington, National Security Council spokesman David Leavy
said President Bill Clinton's national security advisers were
reviewing the situation and ``all options remain on the table.''
	   Defense Secretary William Cohen, who canceled a weeklong Asian
tour to return to Washington for strategy discussions, said the
United States prefers to act with its allies to resolve the latest
standoff with Iraq, but retains the option of unilateral military
action.
	   For now, the United States appeared ready to let the Security
Council take the lead, and there seemed little chance of an
immediate military response. France and Russia, council members
that have taken more lenient positions on relaxing the sanctions in
the past, firmly rebuked Iraq and called for compliance with the
inspectors.
	   ``I personally am very pleased that the U.N. Security Council,
including some people I thought had been a little tolerant with him
in the past, strongly condemned what he did,'' President Bill
Clinton said in a radio interview.
	   No additional U.S. forces were being moved to the Gulf region,
and U.S. forces had not been placed on alert, Pentagon spokesman
Lt. Cmdr. Anthony Cooper said.
	   Earlier this year, the United States rushed warplanes to the
Gulf and threatened military strikes against Iraq if Baghdad
refused to fully cooperate with the weapons inspectors. That crisis
was defused when U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan traveled to
Baghdad in February and secured an Iraqi pledge of cooperation.
	   On Sunday, Ramadan told reporters in Baghdad that ``Iraq does
not fear the threat of the United States because it has been
threatening Iraq for the past eight years.''
	   U.N. sanctions limit Iraq's sale of oil, ban air travel and bar
most trade deals. They were imposed to punish Iraq for its 1990
invasion of Kuwait, which led to the Gulf War.
	   The Security Council has said sanctions will not be lifted until
the U.N. Special Commission, which oversees weapons inspections,
certifies that Iraq has eliminated its weapons of mass destruction.
	   Iraqi officials again insisted Sunday that they have met all of
the U.N. requirements and the embargo should be lifted.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz said the sanctions haven't been
lifted ``because of American pressure and American blackmail of the
Security Council and the international community.''
	   Aziz, in an interview with CNN, characterized the U.N.
commission as a subsidiary of Israel's Mossad spy agency and the
CIA.
	   ``We are not gambling, and we are not seeking confrontation,''
Aziz said on CNN. ``We are just protecting our rights. ... When the
sanctions are not lifted, why should we go on working with
UNSCOM.''
	   Inspectors would not be expelled from Iraq, he said, but they
would not be allowed to work until the dispute over sanctions was
resolved.
	   The Iraqi decision exempted monitors from the Vienna-based
International Atomic Energy Agency, which oversees suspected
nuclear sites. Two IAEA teams in Iraq went into the field unimpeded
Sunday, U.N. officials said.
	   At the United Nations, chief weapons inspector Richard Butler
told CNN he had no intention of withdrawing his teams from Iraq. He
suggested there still was room for compromise, saying ``there did
seem to be some flexibility'' in Iraq.
	   Iraq long has accused Butler of working on behalf of the United
States to prolong the sanctions and has called for his removal.
	   Baghdad announced it would stop cooperating with UNSCOM after
the Security Council pledged Friday to conduct a ``comprehensive
review'' of Iraq's compliance with U.N. resolutions _ but did not
accede to Iraq's demand that this would lead to the lifting of the
sanctions.

Israel waiting for Palestinian security assurances to arrive
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DAFNA LINZER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Israel said it was lifting a 50-day
blockade on Palestinian areas Monday, in a move described by a
senior Israeli official as a ``good-will gesture'' that would allow
some 60,000 Palestinian laborers to return to their jobs in Israel.
	   Israel and the Palestinians were also set to begin implementing
the latest Mideast peace Monday with the completion of a
Palestinian security document.
	   David Bar-Illan, a senior adviser to Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu said ``nothing can move before this document is presented
to the administration.'' Israel was also awaiting U.S. guarantees
which accompanied the agreement signed late last month at the White
House.
	   ``The American letters confirm their interpretation of several
important issues in the memorandum,'' he said.
	   For Netanyahu, the letters and the Palestinian action plan on
fighting terrorism are key to selling the land-for-peace accord to
his right-wing constituents and hardliners in his coalition. His
Cabinet is expected to vote on the agreement Tuesday.
	   Under the accord, the Palestinians are to crackdown on militants
and their infrastructure in exchange for an Israeli handover of
another 13.1 percent of the West Bank.
	   Since a suicide bombing Thursday claimed by the militant Islamic
group Hamas, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has ordered sweeping
arrests and placed the group's spiritual leader under house arrest.
	   But Sunday, Hamas issued an unprecedented attack on Arafat's
Palestinian Authority and, in a first sign of a possible civil
conflict among Palestinians, threatened to strike back.
	   The leaflet denounced the house arrest of Sheik Ahmed Yassin,
whom it called ``the prince of holy warriors'' and warned
Palestinian security forces against pursuing Mohammed Deif, a top
leader of Hamas' military wing whose arrest has been demanded by
Israel. The leaflet condemned the new peace accord as a ``black
agreement.''
	   The threat, in a leaflet faxed to news organizations, cast a
pall over this week's efforts to begin implementing the
Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement, but as of Sunday, both sides
were still pledging to move ahead as scheduled.
	   Asked whether the Hamas leaflet would impeded Arafat's abilities
to fulfill commitments and continue a crackdown on its opposition,
Bar-Illan said ``the Palestinians have told us that they will carry
out the provisions of the accord.''
	   Meanwhile, extremists on both sides _ hard-line Jewish settlers
on the one side, Hamas on the other _ have been trying hard to
derail the accord.
	   On Sunday, with government acquiescence, Jewish settlers built a
fence on a disputed plot of land in traditionally Arab east
Jerusalem, infuriating the Palestinians who quickly termed the move
a violation of the new accord.
	   Elsewhere, settlers in the West Bank moved families into seven
illegally erected mobile homes outside the existing settlement of
Alon Shvut. And in Kiryat Arba, settlers planned to begin new road
construction but Mayor Zvi Katzover denied a TV report that the
community was planning construction of an additional 250 homes.

 &UR; Denver defeats Cincinnati 33-26 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CINCINNATI (AP) _ John Elway led Denver to three fourth-quarter
touchdowns Sunday as the Denver Broncos rallied to beat the
Cincinnati Bengals 33-26 and remain the NFL's only unbeaten team.
	   The defending Super Bowl champions (8-0) added to the best start
in franchise history by turning to its best duo in the last 16
years _ Elway and the fourth quarter.
	   Terrell Davis ran 2 yards for a touchdown and Elway converted
Vaughn Hebron's blocked punt into a 25-yard touchdown pass to Ed
McCaffrey only 2:01 later.
	   The Bengals (2-6) then tied the game at 26 with Neil O'Donnell's
third touchdown pass, a 1-yard throw to Marco Battaglia, and a
2-point conversion.
	   Elway needed only five plays to cover 53 yards and set up Davis'
5-yard touchdown run with 58 seconds left. Davis finished with 149
yards on 27 carries.
 &UR; Packers 36, 49ers 22 &QC; 
	   In Green Bay, Wisconsin, Brett Favre and Antonio Freeman
connected for touchdown pass plays of 80 and 62 yards as Green Bay
beat San Francisco.
	   After blowing a 16-0 lead, the Packers regrouped in the second
half by blitzing Steve Young and returning to the quick-strike
offense that sent them to the last two Super Bowls. Reggie White
had three of Green Bay's nine sacks.
	   Freeman caught seven passes for a career-best 193 yards as the
Packers and 49ers both went home 6-2, one game behind Minnesota for
the NFC's best mark.
 &UR; Bucs 27, Vikings 24 &QC; 
	   In Tampa, Florida, Tampa Bay broke out of an offensive funk with
a team-record 246 yards rushing and beat the NFC's last unbeaten
team 27-24 on Mike Alstott's 6-yard touchdown run with 5:48 to go.
	   Alstott ran for a career-high 128 yards on 19 carries and
Warrick Dunn gained 115 on 18 attempts, giving Tampa Bay (4-4) two
100-yard runners in a game for the first time in franchise history.
	   Randall Cunningham was outstanding in defeat for Minnesota
(7-1), completing 21 of 25 passes for 291 yards and two
touchdowns.
 &UR; Bills 30, Dolphins 24 &QC; 
	   In Orchard Park, New York, Steve Christie kicked three field
goals, two in the last two minutes, to cap a Doug Flutie-led
comeback from a 10-point fourth-quarter deficit.
	   Flutie, who was 15-of-26 for 206 yards and three touchdowns,
threw a 48-yard touchdown to Eric Moulds and Christie kicked the
tiebreaking and an insurance field goal.
	   Dan Marino nearly succeeded in winning the game after Christie's
25-yarder made it 30-24. John Avery returned the kickoff to the
Buffalo 45 and Marino's desperation pass to O.J. McDuffie was
completed 4 yards short of the end zone.
	   That gave the Bills their fifth straight win, four engineered by
Flutie, leaving both teams at 5-3 in a tie atop the AFC East.
 &UR; Redskins 21, Giants 14 &QC; 
	   In Landover, Maryland, Trent Green, Stephen Davis and Skip Hicks
_ all inexperienced backups at the start of the season _ led
Washington to its first victory of the season.
	   Hicks carried five times for 50 yards, including a 4-yard TD run
in the opening drive of the second half to give the Redskins (1-7)
a 21-7 lead. Davis, forced to play fullback after a season-ending
injury to Larry Bowie four weeks ago, caught five passes for 65
yards, including a 12-yard touchdown.
	   And Green, re-promoted after Gus Frerotte's dismal game two
weeks ago, was 21-of-31 for 225 yards and scored the Redskins first
touchdown on a 1-yard bootleg.
	   The Giants (3-5) punted 11 times, scoring on a 90-yard kickoff
return by David Patten and an 11-yard pass from Danny Kanell to Ike
Hilliard.
 &UR; Panthers 31, Saints 17 &QC; 
	   In Charlotte, North Carolina, Steve Beuerlein threw for 132
yards and two touchdowns as Carolina won its first game.
	   Beuerlein, making his fourth start in place of outcast Kerry
Collins, completed 13 of 17 passes for the Panthers (1-7), who
snapped a nine-game losing streak. He threw scoring passes of 31
yards to Raghib Ismail and 1 yard to Muhsin Muhammad.
	   Collins, the Panthers' former No. 1 draft choice who was cut
last month after reportedly saying he no longer had the heart to
play, watched on the sidelines as the backup for New Orleans (4-4).
	   Lame-duck Billy Joe Tolliver, who will be replaced by Collins on
Nov. 15, completed 23 of 43 passes for 307 yards and two
touchdowns, but he was intercepted twice.
 &UR; Jaguars 45, Ravens 19 &QC; 
	   In Baltimore, Jacksonville broke its two-game losing streak with
a vengeance, scoring six touchdowns in the first half against
bumbling Ravens.
	   The Jaguars led 42-13 at halftime after getting three touchdowns
off Baltimore fumbles and another on a blocked punt. The Ravens
(2-6) had more yardage and held the ball twice as long as
Jacksonville (6-2) in the first half, yet committed five turnovers.
	   Mark Brunell was 13-for-20 for 237 yards and three touchdowns.
Fred Taylor scored twice and finished with 87 rushing yards.
 &UR; Oilers 41, Steelers 31 &QC; 
	   In Pittsburgh, Tennessee made up for a decade of frustration in
Three Rivers Stadium by beating the Steelers behind Steve McNair's
three touchdown passes and Eddie George's 153 yards rushing.
	   The Oilers (4-4) led 41-15 until Mike Tomczak replaced Kordell
Stewart in the fourth quarter and led two touchdown drives. The
Steelers (5-3) lost at home for the first time in 11 games and only
second time since 1989 against the Oilers.
	   George ran consistently at the injured-depleted right side of
Pittsburgh's defense and had 101 yards by halftime. He added a
37-yard scoring run that put the Oilers up 27-7 in the third
quarter.
 &UR; Patriots 21, Colts 16 &QC; 
	   In Indianapolis, Drew Bledsoe burned Jeff Burris on a 63-yard
touchdown pass to Tony Simmons as New England beat the Colts.
	   Burris was also called for two pass interference penalties that
set up touchdowns for the Patriots (5-3).
	   Peyton Manning completed a season-high 30 passes for 278 for the
Colts, including two touchdown passes. But the last two
Indianapolis drives ended with interceptions by Lawyer Milloy,
Manning's NFL-high 15th and 16th.
 &UR; Falcons 37, Rams 15 &QC; 
	   In Atlanta, Jamal Anderson rushed for a career-high 172 yards
and scored three touchdowns and Chris Chandler, sidelined last week
by a shoulder injury, threw for 236 yards and two scores for
Atlanta.
	   Chandler's presence made a big impact even though he completed
just 12 of 27 passes and threw an interception that Ryan McNeil
returned 37 yards for a touchdown for St. Louis (2-6).
	   But he also had a 9-yard scoring pass to Anderson and an
18-yarder to Tony Martin as the Falcons (6-2) bounced back from a
28-3 loss to the Jets last week.
 &UR; Jets 20, Chiefs 17 &QC; 
	   In Kansas City, Missouri, John Hall kicked a 32-yard field goal
as time expired and New York, which started the season 0-2, beat
fading Kansas City for its fifth win in six games.
	   The Jets (5-3) moved into a four-way tie atop the AFC East and
handed the Chiefs (4-4) their third straight loss, all since
quarterback Elvis Grbac returned from a shoulder injury.
	   After Louie Aguiar's 25-yard punt, the Jets took over on the
Kansas City 43 with 1:50 left. Vinny Testaverde led the Jets to the
19 and called time with :02 remaining. The Chiefs were penalized
for encroachment, moving Hall five yards closer, and his kick was
perfect.

	   STREOC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. diplomat Julia Taft recently got
some ethnic Albanian hospitality _ walnuts and pudding _ and a
taste of the fear permeating daily life for Kosovo villagers.
	   The assistant U.S. secretary of state, on a one-day visit Sunday
to the embattled Serbian province, protested mildly when the dish
of white, creamy rice pudding came out.
	   Then came a helping of perspective, Kosovo-style. Family members
gave their names but asked journalists not to publish them, for
fear of retribution by Serb police.
	   ``Yes I feel threatened,'' the hostess told Taft. ``I sleep with
my clothes on because that's how we think. We may have to flee.''
	   Others complained that police and soldiers who withdrew from
some areas a week ago returned to harass and arrest people. When
Taft said that despite such incidents, she sensed things were
getting better in Kosovo, the head of the family replied: ``We
don't sense that.''
	   He said only international troops, not an unarmed foreign
verification force being created, could solve their problem.
	   ``The Westerners are not going to solve the problem,'' Taft
responded. ``The people who live here must come to an agreement to
solve their problem.''
	   But the man shook his head, saying: ``I don't think that it will
be possible.''
	   Taft later told a news conference that fear of Serb police and
Yugoslav soldiers continues to prevent people from reclaiming their
normal lives.
	   She said the situation in the Yugoslav province was much better
than during her previous visit two months ago, but thousands of
refugees still were staying away from their homes.
	   ``It's difficult to say that everybody is able to go back home
or is willing to back home,'' she said. ``There is fear among the
population.''
	   While Taft noted Serb police had decreased their visibility,
with only three checkpoints seen during her travels Sunday compared
to the dozens that used to exist, she acknowledged that even a
small police presence was intimidating.
	   Creating a civilian police force in Kosovo, as envisioned by the
Oct. 12 agreement between Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and
U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke, was a ``high priority'' for the
international community, Taft said.
	   ``My sense is that until there is a credible civilian police
presence in the villages and towns, you won't have the confidence
necessary'' for people to move back for good, she said.
	   Western powers led by the United States threatened NATO
airstrikes to force Milosevic to reach the agreement, which calls
for him to withdraw police and military forces to levels before a
February crackdown on Albanian separatists.
	   The agreement also demands full access for relief agencies and a
2,000-member unarmed observer mission that will verify compliance
with the deal. NATO spy planes also will overfly the country, and a
rapid-reaction force is being set up in neighboring Macedonia.
	   In Italy, U.S. Navy spokesman Capt. Steve Burnett said Navy P-3C
Orions would begin regular surveillance flights over Kosovo this
week.
	   Yugoslavia's defense minister said he expects no trouble with
the observer mission set up by the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe, but he warned against possible provocations
by ethnic Albanians.
	   On Sunday, Serb sources reported that Albanian guerrillas
wounded one policeman in an attack on a police vehicle in western
Kosovo. The report could not be independently confirmed.
	   ``The only thing we can be afraid of is that terrorists can make
a provocation harmful for the OSCE representatives,'' Pavle
Bulatovic said in an interview to Belgrade-based BK television late
Saturday.
	   Yugoslav officials warn such a provocation would be intended to
get NATO to react against the Serbs, who might get blamed for any
harm to OSCE observers.

Guerrillas besiege jungle capital, cutting off 120 police officers

	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Hundreds of rebels attacked a police
base in a remote state capital near the Brazilian border, setting
off fighting throughout the day that killed at least four police
officers, wounded nine and cut off communications, the national
police commander said.
	   The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, the country's oldest
and largest rebel band, rained homemade missiles on the garrison in
downtown Mitu, capital of Vaupes state, where 120 officers were
stationed, Gen. Rosso Jose Serrano told an evening news conference
Sunday.
	   He said four officers were killed and nine wounded and the last
radio contact with the besieged Mitu garrision was at 2 p.m.,
exactly eight hours after the attack began. The missiles, shot from
modified propane gas cylinders, were first used in a devastating
Aug. 3 assault that leveled the Miraflores police narcotics base in
the same region.
	   Officials said warplanes and Blackhawk helicopters were sent to
aid the besieged police officers but couldn't land at the town
airport, which the rebels seized. Reinforcements were not expected
to arrive until down Monday.
	   Serrano told reporters he could not confirm rumors of 60 dead
police officers.
	   ``Only when the reinformcements arrive can we determine the
losses,'' he said.
	   The death toll was expected to rise, however, and it was feared
dozens of police could have been captured.
	   Serrano said the rebels blew up Mitu's microwave tower at 5
a.m., cutting off telephone communications, then attacked the
police station.
	   The Amazon Basin city, on the Vaupes River, has 15,000 residents
and can only be reached by air and river. Although no soldiers are
based in the city, its police post is well fortified and surrounded
by barbed wire and trenches, said an army spokesman, Capt. Orlando
Castano.
	   The attack comes exactly a week before a scheduled government
withdrawal from a 42,000-square-kilometer area of southern
Colombia. The government has promised the pullback to meet a rebel
condition for beginning peace talks.
	   No date has been announced for the talks and a letter from the
rebel commander to the government's chief negotiator, released
Sunday, suggests it may be weeks before negotiations begin.
	   In the Oct. 20 letter, Manuel Marulanda accuses the military of
forming special commando units planning to kill him and President
Andres Pastrana at an inaugural ceremony to sabotage the talks.
	   ``For this reason, my presence at the act is not assured,''
Marulanda said in the letter, which was sent to the Radionet
network.
	   The government's chief negotiator, Victor G. Ricardo, told The
Associated Press on Sunday that he had not received the letter.
Ricardo returned Friday with Pastrana from a three-day state visit
to Washington.
	   Before Sunday, the rebel group, known as FARC, was holding at
least 248 soldiers and police officers captive. It has asked the
government to exchange them for 452 jailed rebels before peace
talks commence. So far, Pastrana has refused.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Armed policemen were deployed
outside the federal courthouse Monday in Malaysia's capital city
ahead of the start of the trial of Anwar Ibrahim, once Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad's heir apparent and now the Southeast
Asian country's most famous dissident.
	   Riot police armed with assault rifles braced for new protests
around the courthouse and elsewhere in the capital city.
Demonstrations have been held regularly in the city since Anwar's
arrest on Sept. 20.
	   Anwar's family members were expected to attend the trial. More
than 200 reporters and international observers hoping to watch the
legal proceedings crowded outside the courtroom in Kuala Lumpur
early Monday.
	   London-based Amnesty International, the Human Rights Watch and
the Indonesian Bar Association were among the groups which had sent
representatives to observe the trial.
	   ``We will totally monitor Anwar's trial to examine the nature
and basis of evidence brought against and to assess the proceedings
in light of international standards on fair trial,'' said Mark Daly
of Amnesty International.
	   Judge Augustine Paul was scheduled to hear arguments on four
counts of corruption and one count of sodomy which have been lodged
against Anwar. A separate trial is expected for a separate charge
of abuse of power and four more counts of illegal sex. Anwar, 51,
has denied all the charges.
	   The former No. 2 leader could be jailed for a maximum of 14
years for each of the corruption charges linked to abusing his
power as Malaysia's deputy prime minister from 1993 until his
dismissal on Sept. 2.
	   The prosecution plans to cite testimony from 52 witnesses in the
first round of the hearing, which was scheduled to last until Nov.
14. At that time, the court will break for more than one week as
Malaysia plays host to a meeting of 20 world leaders for an
Asia-Pacific trade forum.
	   The huge international attention on the case and its wide
implications for Malaysian politics forced authorities to shift the
hearing from the High Court building to a large room in the
adjacent federal courthouse.
	   Anwar's dismissal and his arrest has led to unprecedented public
demonstrations against Mahathir and focused attention on the issues
of political dissent, freedom of expression and human rights in
Malaysia.
	   Although the government has said it would not accord special
privileges to international jurists and human rights observers,
dozens flew into Kuala Lumpur for the trial.
	   ``We are here just to ensure due process.'' said Frank Slevin of
Justice International, a British group of jurists.
	   In Melbourne, Australia, a prominent lawyers' group urged the
government to guarantee a fair trial for Anwar. The Law Council of
Australia also called on the government not to impede the work of
international observers attending the trial.
	   The judge had initially ruled that the trial would be conducted
in English because of the widespread interest. But last week, the
chief justice ordered the trial to be conducted in Bhasa, the
language of majority Malays.
	   The room in the federal courthouse was also selected because it
has an underground tunnel connecting it to lockup facilities, and
Anwar was likely to be escorted into the room through the tunnel,
the Sun newspaper reported.
	   When Anwar was arrested, thrown in jail and allegedly roughed up
by police, many began to question the impartiality of the charges
brought against him and started to rally to Anwar's side.
	   Last weekend, a demonstration in the capital turned into a
full-scale riot, the first in Malaysia in nearly three decades.
	   Mahathir, 72, who has ruled Malaysia for 17 years, says he fired
his deputy prime minister on moral grounds because homosexual acts
are illegal in Muslim-majority Malaysia.
	   Each sodomy charge carries a maximum sentence of 20 years
imprisonment and a fine.

	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ The mayor of Tegucigalpa and three
other people died Sunday when their helicopter crashed in the
capital while out surveying storm damage.
	   Authorities said mechanical problems may have caused the crash
that killed Cesar Castellanos, 49, another city official, the pilot
and the mayor's official cameraman. The identities of the other
three aboard were not immediately available, and the nature of the
problems weren't clear.
	   Clear skies had given way to late afternoon showers when the
chopper, in the air for about 20 minutes, went down.
	   News of the crash stunned Hondurans, still reeling from the
storm that battered the entire region and killed more than 230
people in Honduras alone. Castellanos was a popular politician seen
as a likely presidential candidate in 2001 elections.
	   He was elected mayor in December as a candidate for the
opposition National Party, campaigning under the nickname ``El
Gordito'' _ the little fat guy.
	   In an effort to combat rising gang-related crime, Castellanos
imposed a curfew allowing only children accompanied by an adult to
be on city streets after 11 p.m.
	   Castellanos is survived by his wife, Vilma, and five children.

Dollar slips in Tokyo, Japanese stocks higher in early trading
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stock prices advanced moderately early
Monday as investors welcomed word that two major Japanese banks may
form an alliance. The U.S. dollar fell against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 130.43 points,
or 0.96 percent, to 13,694.94 points in the first 30 minutes of
trading. On Friday, the average closed down 104.21 points, or 0.76
percent.
	   Traders said investors pushed up banking shares after two of
Japan's largest banks _ Fuji Bank Ltd. and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank
Ltd. _ said Saturday that they may form a strategic alliance in a
key business area.
	   A proposed merger of the banks' trust banking operations would
be the first such link between top-ranked Japanese lenders and
would signal the latest tie-up designed to cope with increased
competition, a recessionary economy and huge bad loan loads.
	   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange gained 13.95 points, or 1.35
percent, to 1,049.55 points. The TOPIX closed down 1.50 points, or
0.41 percent, on Friday.
	   On the Tokyo Foreign Exchange market, the dollar bought 115.12
yen in early trading, down 0.96 yen from late Friday in Tokyo and
also below its New York level of 116.14 yen late Friday.
	   The dollar weakened, in part, due to expectations for further
cuts in U.S. interest rates, traders said.
	   Lower rates make interest-bearing securities less attractive and
tends to reduce demand for a country's currency.
	   The dollar's dip also stemmed from a Group of Seven
industrialized nations endorsement last week of reforms in Brazil,
which was seen as good news for emerging markets, including those
in Asia, traders said.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese
government bond stood at 0.820 percent, unchanged from Friday's
close. Its price remained unchanged at 108.73 yen.

	   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) _ An opposition coalition appears to have
ousted Macedonia's ruling former Communists, according to
unofficial results from the second round of parliamentary
elections.
	   The outcome could affect NATO's plans to verify the Yugoslav
troop pullback in neighboring Kosovo. The opposition alliance has
expressed opposition to allowing NATO troops on Macedonian soil.
	   Official results from voting Oct. 18 and Sunday were expected
Monday. But unofficial tallies released late Sunday based on exit
polls by both the opposition and the ruling Social Democrats
indicated a new government was likely.
	   The opposition claimed it had won 59 of the 120 seats, followed
by the Social Democrats with 29, an ethnic Albanian group with 24
and three small parties with a total of seven. One seat had been
contested for undisclosed irregularities.
	   The Social Democrat count, also reported by Macedonian
television, had the opposition with 57 seats, followed by the
ruling party with 31, the ethnic Albanians with 24 and the others
divided among the small parties.
	   If the official figures are similar, it would appear the
opposition would have little trouble attracting the few seats
needed for the required 61-seat majority.
	   NATO wants to use Macedonia as a base for its aerial
surveillance of the province. It also wants to station a security
force to protect the 2,000-member ground verification force in
Kosovo, a predominantly ethnic Albanian province of the Yugoslav
republic of Serbia.
	   The opposition had questioned whether Macedonia should become
involved, even indirectly, in the Kosovo crisis.
	   During the election campaign, the opposition coalition said it
opposed the stationing of foreign military forces in Macedonia.
After the first round, however, it appeared to soften that
position, saying it would maintain ``continuity'' in international
agreements reached by the current government.
	   The main issues were Macedonia's weak economy and disputes with
neighbors Bulgaria, Albania and Greece. The average monthly salary
is dlrs 210, and unemployment is at 30 percent.
	   Macedonia declared independence from Yugoslavia six years ago,
the only former republic to have done so without a war. But
tensions are high due to a large ethnic Albanian community and a
border with Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians have been fighting for
independence.
	   Ethnic Albanians make up 23 percent of Macedonia's 2.2 million
people.

Prosecutors expected to appeal High Court decision
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Using testimony from some prominent Chileans to
bolster their case, British prosecutors planned Monday to formally
appeal a High Court decision to throw out the arrest of Gen.
Augusto Pinochet.
	   The prosecutors, acting on behalf of a Spanish magistrate
seeking the former Chilean dictator's extradition on allegations of
murder, kidnapping and torture during his 17-year regime, are
expected to argue that the High Court erred in ruling that Pinochet
is immune from prosecution as a previous head of state.
	   The prosecutors have until the end of the business day Monday to
file the appeal. Hearings before a House of Lords panel of five
senior judges are tentatively scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday.
	   If last Wednesday's High Court ruling ''is not overturned by the
House of Lords then any self-styled head of state or dictator ...
will consider themselves to be immune from any prosecution over
abuse of human rights in Britain,'' said Labor Party lawmaker
Jeremy Corbyn at a vigil Sunday.
	   Anti-Pinochet campaigners such as Isabel Allende, daughter of
the late Chilean President Salvador Allende, whose government was
toppled by Pinochet in 1973, and Juan Pablo Letelier, whose father
was killed in 1976, are among those expected to give testimony to
the House of Lords. Letelier's father, Orlando, was Allende's
foreign minister. He was killed in Washington by a bomb officially
blamed on Pinochet's secret police.
	   Both Allende and Letelier are currently serving in the Chilean
congress.
	   The Chilean government, however, has repeatedly asked that
Pinochet be released on humanitarian grounds.
	   Pinochet, who was granted bail on Friday, is recovering from
back surgery under police guard at the private hospital, Grovelands
Priory Hospital in north London.
	   If the appeal to the House of Lords fails, Pinochet would be
free to leave England. A Chilean air force jet is waiting at Royal
Air Force base Brize Norton outside of London to take him home.
	   Meanwhile, Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar was expected
to meet with Prime Minister Tony Blair later Monday, but a Downing
Street spokesman said they would not be discussing the Spanish
magistrate's attempt to extradite Pinochet.
	   ``Both Governments are of the view that this is a legal and
judicial process and it will not be discussed at all,'' the
spokesman said, speaking with customary anonymity.
	   A report by Chile's democratically elected government says more
than 3,000 people were killed or disappeared during Pinochet's
rule.

	   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) _ Rescue workers recovered hundreds of
bodies from communities buried when a crater lake overflowed and
sent mud and rock hurtling down a volcano on to villages below. The
confirmed deaths blamed on onetime Hurricane Mitch rose to 982.
	   Authorities feared that many more bodies would be found in 10
villages at the foot of the Casitas Volcano in northern Nicaragua.
	   Mitch was one of the most violent hurricanes to hit the
Caribbean, causing heavy rain and floods as it cut a fatal path
along the coasts of Honduras, Nicaragua and other Central American
countries. It had weakened to a tropical depression by Sunday.
	   The mayor of the Honduran capital and three others died Sunday
in a helicopter crash while out surveying flood damage. Tegucigalpa
Mayor Cesar Castellanos, 49, had been seen as a likely candidate
for president in 2001 elections.
	   The first army rescue helicopters to reach the Casitas volcano
on Sunday found widespread destruction, army spokesman Capt. Milton
Sandoval said. Rescue workers recovered 360 bodies in four villages
near Posoltega, about 50 miles (80 kms) northwest of Managua.
	   A river of mud and rubble collapsed on the villages late Friday
or early Saturday after a crater lake near the volcano's peak
overflowed and caused part of the mountain to crumble, Sandoval
said.
	   Only 92 of the estimated 2,000 area residents had been found
alive, some injured, and the remainder were listed as missing,
Sandoval said.
	   Rescuers aboard the first army helicopters to reach the
communities found hundreds of decomposing bodies, he said. One
hundred soldiers working at the scene were burying the rotting
bodies where they lay because of public health concerns, Sandoval
said.
	   It was unclear how many residents of the villages of El
Porvenir, Versalles, Rolando Rodriguez and Santa Narcisa may have
fled in time to avoid the mudslide. Dr. Marcos Espinosa said in a
telephone interview that 126 survivors from the four villages had
been treated at a hospital in Chinandega for ``fractures and
serious wounds'' that had become infected after the victims spent
nearly two days in the mud.
	   A woman who claimed to have survived the disaster told Radio
Nicaragua on Sunday that she had seen ``many unburied bodies'' near
the volcano. The survivor, Mercedes Rodriguez Zapata, said she left
the area Saturday and traveled on foot and horseback to the
capital, Managua.
	   Unconfirmed radio reports said as many as 4,000 people may have
died when mudslides struck in the northwestern province of
Chinandega.
	   Elsewhere Sunday, army rescue helicopters flew 52 famished and
ailing men, women and children from the town of San Francisco
Libre, on the northern banks of Managua Lake, about 25 miles (40
kms) north of the capital. In that community alone, 1,600 families
were left homeless.
	   Rescue workers left behind rice, corn, beans and other
provisions before taking the sick to get medical care.
	   Nicaraguan President Arnoldo Aleman called the flooding and
mudslides the country's worst natural disaster since a
magnitude-6.2 earthquake killed 5,000 people in 1972.
	   Aleman said he would declare a period of national mourning
``because of the enormous tragedy the people of Nicaragua are
suffering.''
	   By official count, 225 people have been killed in Nicaragua
alone from heavy rain and flash flooding _ apparently in addition
to the 360 dead in Posoltega _ for a total of 585. Another 253
people were listed as missing, the National Civil Defense reported.
	   Nicaragua has asked the United States to lend it several large
helicopters to help deliver supplies and assess damage in remote
areas.
	   In Honduras, at least 235 deaths have been blamed on Mitch, the
National Emergency Commission said Saturday.
	   El Salvador _ where 140 people died in flash floods _ declared a
state of emergency Saturday, as did Guatemala, where 21 people died
when floods swept away their homes. Mexico reported one death from
Mitch last Monday.
	   In the Caribbean, the U.S. Coast Guard widened a search for a
tourist schooner with 31 people aboard that hasn't been heard from
since Tuesday.
	   By late Sunday, Mitch's winds, once near 180 mph (290 kph), had
dropped to near 30 mph (50 kph), and the storm _ now classified as
a tropical depression _ was near Tapachula, on Mexico's southern
Pacific coast near the Guatemalan border.
	   Mitch was moving west at 8 mph (13 kph) and was dissipating, but
threatened to strengthen again if it moved back out to sea.

Prince shows lots of flash in title defense
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN CURRAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTIC CITY, New Jersey (AP) _ In his WBO featherweight title
defense against Wayne McCullough, Prince Naseem Hamed was vintage
Prince Naseem Hamed.
	   From the music video-style entrance _ out of a makeshift
Convention Hall graveyard equipped with smoky fog, standup dummies
and a fire-breathing pipe organ _ to the dance moves and Ali
shuffles he performed in the ring, Hamed made good on his
reputation as a shameless self-promoter who loves to showboat.
	   But when it came to the actual fighting, he was less than gung
ho.
	   Hamed, who predicted he would send the scrappy Irishman into
retirement with a third-round knockout, ended up settling for a
12-round unanimous decision Saturday before a raucous crowd of
8,138.
	   A 5-1 favorite, Hamed (31-0) spent most of the fight circling
the ring, darting in occasionally to deliver two- and three-punch
combinations. Mostly, he made McCullough (22-2) chase him.
	   Cheered on by more than 1,000 of his countrymen, McCullough, 28,
of Belfast, Northern Ireland, forced the action throughout and even
landed a few solid right hands to Hamed's head.
	   ``A few times I said, `Come on and fight. You're the champion.
You're supposed to knock me out,''' a disgusted McCullough said
afterward.
	   ``If I'd have stood off Naseem, there wouldn't have been a fight
tonight. I could've sat in the corner and had a cup of tea,''
McCullough said. ``How can you be a world champion and run away? I
don't say stand toe to toe, but at least come to me.''
	   Hamed, 24, of Sheffield, England, had no apologies. He insisted
he wasn't running, and compared himself to Ali and Sugar Ray
Leonard in his fighting style.
	   ``Wayne really came to fight. He's got a big heart and hard
head. But my style will always beat Wayne McCullough's. He was
very, very lucky not to get stopped,'' Hamed said.
	   He complained that the ring apron was slippery and that he
couldn't plant his foot to throw his hardest punches.
	   ``It was a ball in there. I took my time. I had a laugh, I had a
dance, I had a shuffle,'' Hamed said.
	   Judge John Stewart scored it 118-110, judge Nelson Vazquez
117-111 and judge Clark Sammartino 116-112 for Hamed. The
Associated Press had Hamed winning 116-111.
	   On the undercard, IBF junior featherweight champion Vuyani Bungu
of South Africa retained his title with a 12-round majority
decision over Danny Romero of the United States. Also, Marco
Antonio Barrera took the WBO junior featherweight title from
champion Richie Wenton, stopping him in the third round of a
scheduled 12-rounder.

	   Armed policemen were deployed outside the federal courthouse
Monday in Malaysia's capital city ahead of the start of the trial.
	   Riot police armed with assault rifles braced for new protests
around the courthouse and elsewhere in the city. Demonstrations
have been held regularly since Anwar's arrest on Sept. 20.
	   Anwar's family members attended the trial. More than 200
reporters and international observers hoping to watch the legal
proceedings crowded outside the courtroom in Kuala Lumpur early
Monday.
	   London-based Amnesty International, the Human Rights Watch and
the Indonesian Bar Association were among the groups which sent
representatives to observe the trial.

	   ``We will totally monitor Anwar's trial to examine the nature
and basis of evidence brought against and to assess the proceedings
in light of international standards on fair trial,'' said Mark Daly
of Amnesty International.
	   Judge Augustine Paul was scheduled to hear arguments about four
counts of corruption and one count of sodomy which have been lodged
against Anwar. A separate trial is expected for a separate charge
of abuse of power and four more counts of illegal sex. Anwar, 51,
has denied all the charges.
	   The former No. 2 leader could be jailed for a maximum of 14
years for each of the corruption charges linked to his alleged
abuse of power as Malaysia's deputy prime minister from 1993 until
his dismissal on Sept. 2.
	   Each illegal sex charge is punishable with 20 years in jail and
whipping.
	   The prosecution plans to cite testimony from 52 witnesses in the
first round of the hearing, which was scheduled to last until Nov.
14. At that time, the court will break for more than one week as
Malaysia plays host to a meeting of 20 world leaders for an
Asia-Pacific trade forum.
	   The widespread international attention on the case and its huge
implications for Malaysian politics forced authorities to shift the
hearing from the High Court building to a large room in the
adjacent federal courthouse.
	   Anwar's dismissal and his arrest has led to unprecedented public
demonstrations against Mahathir and focused attention on the issues
of political dissent, freedom of expression and human rights in
Malaysia.

	   Although the government has said it would not accord special
privileges to international jurists and human rights observers,
dozens flew into Kuala Lumpur for the trial.
	   ``We are here just to ensure due process.'' said Frank Slevin of
Justice International, a British group of jurists.
	   In Melbourne, Australia, a prominent lawyers' group urged the
government to guarantee a fair trial for Anwar. The Law Council of
Australia also called on the government not to impede the work of
international observers attending the trial.
	   The judge had initially ruled that the trial would be conducted
in English because of the intense interest abroad. But last week,
the chief justice ordered the trial to be conducted in Bhasa, the
language of majority Malays.
	   When Anwar was arrested, thrown in jail and allegedly roughed up
by police, many began to question the impartiality of the charges
brought against him and started to rally to Anwar's side.
	   Last weekend, a demonstration in the capital turned into a
full-scale riot, the first in Malaysia in nearly three decades.
	   Mahathir, 72, who has ruled Malaysia for 17 years, says he fired
his deputy prime minister on moral grounds because homosexual acts
are illegal in Muslim-majority Malaysia.

Inman gets first senior win
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Joe Inman closed with three birdies and two
pars for his first Senior PGA Tour win, a one-stroke victory over
Lee Trevino in the dlrs 1.1 million Pacific Bell Senior Classic.
	   Inman's 3-under-par 68 on Sunday gave him an 11-under 202 total
and the first-place check of dlrs 165,000. Inman, 50, is in his
first year on the senior tour and his best finish had been a tie
for third at the Bank of Boston Classic in August.
	   Inman started his late birdie run with a 12-foot (3.5-meter)
putt at the par-5 14th hole, then made consecutive 10-foot
(3-meter) birdie putts at 15, a par-4, and 16, another par-5, to
take the lead for good.
	   Trevino, who had a 65, bogeyed No. 17 and finished at 203 after
three trips around the 6,575-yard (6,010 meters) Wilshire Country
Club course.
	   ``It was just nice to stand up and come through one of these
times,'' Inman said. ``I was standing on the 18th tee and knew Lee
Trevino was in the clubhouse. And all I had to do was get by a
440-yard (400-meter) hole with water on the right and trouble on
the left. I hit a good drive and put my 6-iron on the green.''
	   Inman, who has two other top-10 finishes this year, needed only
a two-putt to win but his approach went four feet (1.3 meters) by
the hole.
	   Two-time defending champion Gil Morgan closed with a 70 to
finish at 204, tied with Brian Barnes, who had a closing 66.
	   Hubert Green finished with a 69 and was alone at 206, one stroke
better than Bobby Stroble, who also had a 69.
	   Inman, who had one win _ the 1976 Kemper Open _ on the PGA Tour,
had a share of the lead after each of the first two rounds and his
victory vaulted him from 42nd place on the money list to 27th,
securing him a spot in next week's final Senior PGA Tour event, the
dlrs 2 million Senior Tour Championship.
	   ``I did not play as well today as I did yesterday,'' said Inman,
who needed to get to 31st or better to qualify for the season
finale. ``And I haven't played many good Sunday rounds all year. I
didn't drive the ball well, had to scramble all day today but was
able to hold it together. I am overwhelmed by this.''
	   Trevino birdied four of the first seven holes on the back side
but let the tournament slip away when he failed to save par with a
25-footer (8-meter shot) on the 17th hole.
	   ``Bogey at the 17th was critical,'' Trevino said. ``I really had
a bad lie in front of the green on that hole and just couldn't get
it close.''
	   Trevino had seven birdies without a bogey until the next-to-last
hole.
	   ``I hit the ball OK but not as good as Friday,'' Trevino added.
``Joe made it interesting on the final hole but I was pulling for
him to make that 4-footer.''
	   Trevino earned dlrs 96,800, his second largest check this year
after the dlrs 150,000 he got for winning the Southwestern Bell.
	   Barnes and Morgan each earned dlrs 72,000, but Barnes finished
32nd on the money list and out of next week's final event.
	   Inman's win also knocked Bob Dickson out of the top 31.
	   ``I'm proud of myself,'' Inman said. ``I realize now that I had
a better game when I was younger but I never gave myself credit for
it. We all have doubts. The key is to fight back that voice inside
that gives you those doubts.''

<TEXT>
	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ The mayor of Tegucigalpa and three
other people died Sunday when their helicopter crashed in the
capital while surveying storm damage.
	   Authorities said mechanical problems may have caused the crash
that killed Cesar Castellanos, 49, another city official, the pilot
and the mayor's official cameraman. The identities of the other
three aboard were not immediately available, and the nature of the
problems weren't clear.
	   Clear skies had given way to late afternoon showers when the
chopper, after about 20 minutes in the air, went down.
	   News of the crash stunned Hondurans, still reeling from the
storm that battered the entire region and killed more than 230
people in Honduras alone.
	   Castellanos was a popular politician seen as a likely
presidential candidate in 2001 elections. He was elected mayor in
November as a candidate for the opposition National Party,
campaigning under the nickname ``El Gordito'' _ the little fat guy.
	   Known for his attention to everyday issues such as tax
collection and garbage pick ups, Castellanos had overseen recovery
efforts from this week's flooding and pledged to rebuild
Tegucigalpa's downed bridges and washed-out roads.

American to head Australian mining and energy giant
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australian steel, mining and energy
giant BHP Co. Ltd. ended months of speculation about a new chief
executive on Monday by announcing the appointment of Paul Anderson
to the post.
	   Anderson, 53, an American who currently serves as president and
chief operating officer of U.S. power company Duke Energy Corp.,
will take up his new appointment next month.
	   He said Monday that his focus will be on creating wealth for BHP
shareholders and shoring up confidence in the diversified mining
group.
	   ``We need to restore confidence in the company both internally
and externally. This will be achieved by setting high standards in
all we do and delivering results,'' Anderson said.
	   Anderson will also become BHP's managing director and a member
of the board.
	   He replaces John Prescott, whose resignation took effect on
April 7 following criticism by investors about BHP's poor profit
performance and investment decisions.
	   BHP management has been under fire after taking Australian
dollars 4 billion (U.S. dlrs 2.4 billion) in asset writedowns over
the past two years and a net loss of Australian dollars 1.47
billion (U.S. dlrs 900 million) for the 12-month period ended on
May 31.
	   Chairman Jerry Ellis bowed to shareholder pressure earlier this
year, announcing he would retire in the first half of 1999. He will
be replaced by National Australia Bank Ltd. managing director Don
Argus.
	   Ellis said Anderson's appointment marked the successful
conclusion of a global search for a new chief executive, and that
BHP was delighted to welcome Anderson.
	   ``He brings to the company a proven track record in creating
shareholder value,'' he said.
	   Anderson is president, chief operating officer and a member of
the board of Duke Energy Corp., based in Charlotte, North Carolina.
He also serves on the boards of Kerr-McGee Corp., Baker Hughes
Inc., Temple-Inland Inc. and TEPPCO Partners LP.
	   Duke Energy Corp. has a market capitalization of U.S. dlrs 22
billion and has operations in 50 countries.
	   Analysts welcomed Anderson's appointment.
	   ``It resolves some of the uncertainty,'' Nomura Australia
analyst Eric Betts said. ``He seems like an action man, a can-do
type of guy.''
	   Anderson's appointment would fulfill the market's desire for an
outsider to take over Prescott's vacated post, he said.
	   ``That he's not an insider will be seen as bringing some fresh
blood into the company,'' Betts said. ``I don't think the market
would really care if he was Martian as long as he got the job
done.''
	   Shares in the diversified miner jumped sharply in early trade on
news of the appointment. At 1230 GMT, BHP shares were 25 Australian
cents stronger at Australian dollars 13.85 (U.S. dlrs 8.44).

China announces formal ties with Tonga
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Confirming earlier reports, China announced
Monday that it had established formal ties with the South Pacific
kingdom of Tonga, wooing yet another diplomatic ally away from
rival Taiwan.
	   China and Tonga signed a joint communique on Oct. 26 that set up
official relations as of Monday, the state-run Xinhua News Agency
said.
	   The announcement was expected following Taiwan's decision
Saturday to sever ties with Tonga, the fourth country to switch
diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing so far this year,
following the lead of South Africa, the Central African Republic
and Guinea-Bissau.
	   Taiwan and China split politically in 1949 and China considers
Taiwan a renegade province with no right to independent relations
with foreign governments. The two have used financial aid,
technical support and private investment to lure away each other's
allies.
	   Tonga's move shrinks to 26 the number of nations that continue
to shun Beijing and recognize Taiwan.
	   Under the communique signed last week, Tonga declared that
Beijing was the sole government of all China and that Taiwan was
part of its territory, Xinhua said.
	   It said that during a visit to Beijing last week, President
Jiang Zemin praised the Tongan foreign minister, Prince
Ulukalala-Lavaka-Ata, for his ``farsighted strategic vision and
political savvy.''
	   The prince praised China as a ``great nation'' and said his
country could learn much from it, Xinhua reported.
	   Taiwan reacted to Tonga's decision by accusing Tonga of
succumbing to enticements from Beijing and blaming China of trying
to undermine recent improvements in relations between Taipei and
Beijing.
	   Taiwan officials said China had promised a grant to Tonga to
help it build a commercial satellite.
	   Tonga's switch came just two weeks after a watershed meeting
between top negotiators of Taiwan and China at which the two sides
vowed to seek to narrow their differences over restoring a dialogue
China broke off in 1995 in anger over a Taiwanese drive to gain
international recognition.

North Korean leader reported in good health
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ North Korean leader Kim Jong Il was
described by Seoul's leading industrialist and his family as
healthy, kind and respectful _ a far cry from usual depictions.
	   Chung Ju-yung, 84, founder of the Hyundai conglomerate, met the
56-year-old North Korean leader last weekend and came away with a
number of multimillion-dollar business deals.
	   He also came away impressed.
	   Chung described Kim as ``healthy and energetic'' and a ``kind
and respectful young man'' who visited him at his guest quarters in
Pyongyang Friday night out of concern for his age.
	   ``He appears to have a deep sense of respect for elderly
people,'' Chung Mong-hun, a 50-year-old son of the Hyundai chief
who was present at the audience, told reporters Monday.
	   Chung and three family members, all of whom were born in North
Korea, were the first known outside visitors to meet Kim since he
completed his ascension to full power in the reclusive communist
state in September.
	   A souvenir photograph of Chung and his son taken with the North
Korean leader, shows Kim standing to the left, giving center stage
to the elder Chung.
	   Kim has been described as a shy, enigmatic, cruel and ruthless
dictator. The younger Chung, however, called him ``a man of manners
with a sense of humor.''
	   The leader's voice was so loud and clear that the elder Chung,
who has a hearing problem, could understand him without any
difficulty, the younger Chung said.
	   Chung's ventures in North Korea include a dlrs 906 million
tourism project, a thermal power plant, a car assembly plant and an
industrial park.
	   The sightseeing project would be the largest inter-Korea joint
venture since the peninsula was divided into the communist North
and capitalist South in 1945.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Amid tight security, a High Court
judge Monday began the trial of Malaysia's most famous dissident,
Anwar Ibrahim, who until recently served as the Southeast Asian
country's No. 2 leader.
	   Policemen armed with assault rifles patrolled outside the
federal courthouse in Malaysia's capital city to prevent possible
protests by Anwar supporters. About 200 supporters of Anwar
gathered nearby, but police blocked them from approaching the
courthouse, eyewitnesses said.
	   Demonstrations have been held regularly since the former deputy
premier's arrest on Sept. 20.
	   Riot police carrying shields and batons stood by as guards stood
in front of the courthouse entrance, allowing only those connected
with the trial and a few reporters inside. A policeman searched all
those entering with a hand-held metal detector.
	   Anwar's family members were among those in attendance at the
trial. More than 100 reporters and international observers hoping
to watch the legal proceedings milled about outside the court
building, which faces Independence Square _ scene of many recent
pro-Anwar protests.
	   London-based Amnesty International, the Human Rights Watch and
the Indonesian Bar Association were among the groups which sent
representatives to observe the trial.
	   ``We will totally monitor Anwar's trial to examine the nature
and basis of evidence brought against him and to assess the
proceedings in light of international standards on fair trial,''
said Mark Daly of Amnesty International.
	   Judge Augustine Paul was scheduled to hear arguments about four
counts of corruption and one count of sodomy which have been lodged
against Anwar. A separate trial is expected for another charge of
abuse of power and four more counts of illegal sex.
	   Anwar, 51, has denied all the charges, saying they were
politically motivated to eclipse his movement challenging Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad's rule.
	   The former deputy prime minister could be jailed for a maximum
of 14 years for each of the corruption charges linked to his
alleged abuse of power during his tenure from 1993 until his
dismissal on Sept. 2.
	   Each illegal sex charge is punishable with 20 years in jail and
whipping.
	   The prosecution plans to cite testimony from 52 witnesses in the
first round of the hearing, which was scheduled to last until Nov.
14. At that time, the court will break for more than one week as
Malaysia plays host to a meeting of 20 world leaders for an
Asia-Pacific trade forum.
	   The widespread international attention on the case and its huge
implications for Malaysian politics forced authorities to shift the
hearing from the High Court building to a large room in the
adjacent federal courthouse.
	   Anwar's dismissal and his arrest has led to unprecedented public
demonstrations against Mahathir and focused attention on the issues
of political dissent, freedom of expression and human rights in
Malaysia.
	   Although the government has said it would not accord special
privileges to international jurists and human rights observers,
dozens flew into Kuala Lumpur for the trial.
	   Before the trial started, the judge heard an appeal for letting
the several dozen observers inside the packed courtroom.
	   ``We are here just to ensure due process,'' said Frank Slevin of
Justice International, a British group of jurists.
	   ``We're obviously deeply concerned about aspects of Mr. Anwar's
arrest, detention, and trial,'' said Sidney Jones of the New
York-based Human Rights Watch.
	   ``But we are equally concerned about the government's reliance
on the Internal Security Act and what appears to be growing
restrictions on freedom of expression and assembly that affect a
much larger number of people,'' she said.
	   The ISA, a law that allows detention without trial, has been
used to detain a number of Anwar's supporters.
	   The Malaysian Bar council, a body of nearly 8,000 lawyers, was
also not allowed to send its representative to monitor the trial.
	   In Melbourne, Australia, a prominent lawyers' group urged the
government to guarantee a fair trial for Anwar. The Law Council of
Australia also called on the government not to impede the work of
international observers attending the trial.
	   The judge had initially ruled that the trial would be conducted
in English because of the intense interest abroad. But last week,
the chief justice ordered the trial to be conducted in Bhasa, the
language of majority Malays.
	   When Anwar was arrested, thrown in jail and allegedly roughed up
by police, many began to question the impartiality of the charges
brought against him and started to rally to Anwar's side.
	   Last weekend, a demonstration in the capital turned into a
full-scale riot, the first in Malaysia in nearly three decades.
	   Mahathir, 72, who has ruled Malaysia for 17 years, says he fired
his deputy prime minister on moral grounds because homosexual acts
are illegal in Muslim-majority Malaysia.

	   President Arnoldo Aleman declared three days of national
mourning. He admitted that the number of dead ``will be rising as
we learn more.''
	   Aleman called the flooding and mudslides the country's worst
natural disaster since a magnitude 6.2 earthquake killed 5,000
people in 1972.
	   ``I am profoundly moved and filled with pain to the bottom of my
heart'' by a storm ``that has left a dramatic toll of death, blood,
suffering and terrible destruction,'' Aleman said.
	   Farm worker Francisco Manuel Pineda told a local reporter of
leaving his village the morning of the disaster to return to find a
soggy graveyard that buried not only his home but his wife, his
father, his mother, his siblings and several of his children.
	   ``We found him near where his home had been, sitting on a tree
trunk, weeping,'' said Mario Mairena, a reporter from the Managua
daily El Nuevo Diario, said after returning to the capital
following a trip to the region on a military helicopter.
	   ``We saw bodies everywhere,'' Pineda said. ``Hands, legs and
even the entire bodies of two girls decomposing in the mud.''

	   Mitch was one of the most violent hurricanes to hit the
Caribbean, causing heavy rain and floods as it cut a fatal path
along the coasts of Honduras, Nicaragua and other Central American
countries. Its winds have weakened in recent days.
	   The first army rescue helicopters to reach the volcano on Sunday
found widespread destruction, army spokesman Capt. Milton Sandoval
said. Rescue workers recovered 360 bodies in four villages near
Posoltega, about 50 miles (80 kms) northwest of Managua.
	   A river of mud and rubble collapsed on the villages Friday after
a crater lake near the volcano's peak overflowed and caused part of
the mountain to crumble, Sandoval said.
	   Only 92 of the estimated 2,000 area residents were found alive,
some injured, and the remainder were listed as missing, Sandoval
said.
	   Rescuers aboard the first army helicopters to reach the
communities found hundreds of decomposing bodies, he said. One
hundred soldiers working at the scene were burying the rotting
bodies of the victims where they lay because of public health
concerns, Sandoval said.
	   It was unclear whether any residents of the villages of El
Porvenir, Versalles, Rolando Rodriguez and Santa Narcisa had fled
ahead of the mudslide or whether they were asleep in their homes
when it struck.
	   At least 126 injured survivors from those villages were treated
at the Espana hospital in nearby Chinandega for ``fractures and
serious wounds'' that became infected after the victims spent
nearly two days in the mud, Dr. Marcos Espinosa said in a telephone
interview.
	   Officially, Nicaragua reported 225 dead from heavy rain and
flash flooding there, in addition to the 360 dead in Posoltega, for
a total of 585 confirmed dead.
	   In Honduras, at least 242 deaths have been blamed on Mitch, the
National Emergency Commission said. A helicopter surveying flood
damage in Tegucigalpa, the capital, crashed Sunday, killing the
city's Mayor, Cesar Castellanos and three other people aboard,
local media reported.
	   The extent of Mitch's damage in Nicaragua appeared to be
widespread.
	   Army rescue helicopters on Sunday morning lifted 52 famished and
ailing men, women and children out of San Francisco Libre, on the
northern banks of Managua Lake, about 25 miles (40 km) north of the
capital. In that community alone, 1,600 families were left
homeless.
	   Candido Mejia, 58, was so weak that he could barely give his
name after he and his two children were airlifted out of the town
using rope harnesses.
	   Inhabitants said they had to climb up into trees and on the
roofs of their houses last week when the lake's edge expanded by 3
kilometers (2 miles) and flooded the farming town. No deaths were
reported, but many people had not eaten for days.
	   Rescue workers left behind provisions of rice, corn, beans,
cooking oil and milk before taking the sick to get medical care.
	   It was unclear how many other towns across Nicaragua were left
in similar circumstances.
	   Nicaragua has asked the United States to lend it several large
helicopters to help deliver supplies and assess damage in remote
areas, Defense Minister Pedro J. Chamorro Barrios said Saturday.
	   El Salvador _ where 140 people died in flash flooding _ declared
a state of emergency, as did Guatemala, where 21 people died when
floods swept away their homes. Mexico reported one death from Mitch
last Monday.
	   In western Guatemala, a C-47 cargo plane crashed Sunday, killing
12 people aboard and injuring six. The accident may have been
caused by bad weather associated with Mitch, according to officials
at the Guatemala City international airport.
	   The plane was apparently operated by a Protestant missionary
group with ties to the United States, but the nationalities of the
victims were not immediately available.
	   In the Caribbean, the U.S. Coast Guard widened a search for a
tourist schooner with 31 people aboard that hasn't been heard from
since Tuesday.
	   By late Sunday, Mitch's winds, once near 180 mph, had dropped to
near 30 mph, and the storm _ now classified as a tropical
depression _ was near Tapachula, on Mexico's southern Pacific coast
near the Guatemalan border.
	   Mitch was moving west at 8 mph and was dissipating but
threatened to strengthen again if it moved back out to sea.

Police to publish photos of young victims, reports say
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ British police want to publish photographs of the
400 victims of an Internet child pornography ring in an attempt to
identify them and prevent further abuse, according to newspaper
reports Monday.
	   The British National Crime Squad, which coordinated the
international crackdown on the so-called Wonderland Club in
September, said it would propose publishing the photographs in
newspapers and on television.
	   ''It is the only way I can think of to try to find out who these
children are,'' Detective Superintendent John Stewardson of the
National Crime Squad told The Independent in Monday's edition.
''The primary concern has to be to stop the abuse.''
	   The National Crime Squad will discuss their plans next month
with the other police forces involved, The Daily Telegraph
reported.
	   On Sept. 2, police in 12 countries raided the homes of more than
100 suspected pedophiles in attempt to break the Internet club,
which authorities said exchanged pornographic pictures of children
as young as 2 on the Internet.
	   The raids came after a five-month investigation into the group.
Police uncovered a computer database containing more than 10,000
pornographic photographs of children.
	   The countries involved in the raids included Australia, Austria,
Belgium, Britain, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Norway,
Portugal, Sweden and the United States.
	   British authorities said more than 40 arrests were made
worldwide, and officials predicted there would be more. Hundreds of
people are suspected of being connected with the pornography ring.
	   In Britain, police arrested 11 men in a raid on 14 addresses. In
the United States, where the pornographic ring originated, the U.S.
Customs Service conducted 32 federal search and seizure warrants in
22 states and arrested four people.
	   Police had said that 10 people were arrested in Germany, eight
in Norway, five in France and three in Italy. Police in Sweden also
reported one arrest, and four arrests were reported in Australia.
	   To join the child pornography ring, members had to have multiple
images of child pornography.

	   Major events leading up to the trial of sacked Malaysian deputy
prime minister Anwar Ibrahim.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   June-September, 1997: Asian financial crisis hits Malaysia.
Mahathir reverses several actions Anwar took while serving as
acting premier in the preceding two months, alienating foreign
investors.
	   June 18-21, 1998: The leader of Malaysia's ruling party youth
wing, and Anwar ally, attacks cronyism at the annual party
congress.
	   June 24: Mahathir undercuts Anwar, who also served as Finance
Minister, with the promotion of adviser Daim Zainuddin to the
Cabinet as economic policy czar.

supporters, resign just before Mahathir imposes controls on the
flow of capital.
	   Sept. 1: Malaysia imposes radical restrictions on foreign
exchange trading.

the prime minister to fire him from his two Cabinet posts. Federal
police chief says Anwar is under investigation.

sexual crimes and treason, including leaking state secrets. Anwar
is expelled from the ruling party.
	   Sept. 6: Anwar's adopted brother are arrested along with two of
his former private secretaries and two other friends. The brother
and one friend later confess to committing sodomy with Anwar.
	   Sept. 11: Anwar begins series of public rallies demanding
reform. He denies the allegations against him and steps up his
attacks on Mahathir.

	   Sept. 27: Police break up massive downtown demonstrations with
tear gas and water cannon.
	   Sept. 29: Anwar appears in court with a black eye and pleads not
guilty to five corruption and four sodomy charges. He says police
beat him until he became unconscious and then denied him medical
attention.

	   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) _ Rescue workers recovered hundreds of
bodies Sunday from a mudslide that sent tons of mud and rock
hurtling down on villages below. Nicaragua's vice president said
between 1,000 and 1,500 are presumed dead, but the total death toll
may never be fully known.
	   The confirmed deaths from former Hurricane Mitch throughout the
region climbed to 1,001 late Sunday.
	   But the worst damage was done to 10 communities at the foot of
the Casitas Volcano in northern Nicaragua, when one of its slopes
apparently collapsed.
	   Vice President Enrique Bolanos, said Sunday night that between
1,000 and 1,500 people were buried in at least two of the
communities where the flood of mud and rocks covered 80 square
kilometers (32 square miles).
	   ``We perhaps will never know how many people died,'' Bolanos
said.
	   President Arnoldo Aleman declared three days of national
mourning. He admitted that the number of dead ``will be rising as
we learn more.''
	   Aleman called the flooding and mudslides the country's worst
natural disaster since a magnitude 6.2 earthquake killed 5,000
people in 1972.
	   ``I am profoundly moved and filled with pain to the bottom of my
heart'' by a storm ``that has left a dramatic toll of death, blood,
suffering and terrible destruction,'' Aleman said.
	   Farm worker Francisco Manuel Pineda told a local reporter of
leaving his village the morning of the disaster to return to find a
soggy graveyard that buried not only his home but his wife, his
father, his mother, his siblings and several of his children.
	   ``We found him near where his home had been, sitting on a tree
trunk, weeping,'' said Mario Mairena, a reporter from the Managua
daily El Nuevo Diario, said after returning to the capital
following a trip to the region on a military helicopter.
	   ``We saw bodies everywhere,'' Pineda said. ``Hands, legs and
even the entire bodies of two girls decomposing in the mud.''
	   Mitch was one of the most violent hurricanes to hit the
Caribbean, causing heavy rain and floods as it cut a fatal path
along the coasts of Honduras, Nicaragua and other Central American
countries. Its winds have weakened in recent days.
	   The first army rescue helicopters to reach the volcano on Sunday
found widespread destruction, army spokesman Capt. Milton Sandoval
said. Rescue workers recovered 360 bodies in four villages near
Posoltega, about 50 miles (80 kms) northwest of Managua.
	   A river of mud and rubble collapsed on the villages Friday after
a crater lake near the volcano's peak overflowed and caused part of
the mountain to crumble, Sandoval said.
	   Only 92 of the estimated 2,000 area residents were found alive,
some injured, and the remainder were listed as missing, Sandoval
said.
	   Rescuers aboard the first army helicopters to reach the
communities found hundreds of decomposing bodies, he said. Some 100
soldiers working at the scene were burying the rotting bodies of
the victims where they lay because of public health concerns,
Sandoval said.
	   It was unclear whether any residents of the villages of El
Porvenir, Versalles, Rolando Rodriguez and Santa Narcisa had fled
ahead of the mudslide or whether they were asleep in their homes
when it struck.
	   At least 126 injured survivors from those villages were treated
at the Espana hospital in nearby Chinandega, Dr. Marcos Espinosa
said in a telephone interview.
	   Officially, Nicaragua reported 225 dead from heavy rain and
flash flooding there, in addition to the 360 dead in Posoltega, for
a total of 585 confirmed dead.
	   In Honduras, at least 242 deaths have been blamed on Mitch, the
National Emergency Commission said. A helicopter surveying flood
damage in Tegucigalpa, the capital, crashed Sunday, killing the
city's Mayor, Cesar Castellanos and three other people aboard,
local media reported.
	   In the most severely effected areas, rescue workers left behind
provisions of rice, corn, beans, cooking oil and milk for people
left without any food before taking the sick to get medical care.
	   Nicaragua has asked the United States to lend it several large
helicopters to help deliver supplies and assess damage in remote
areas, Defense Minister Pedro J. Chamorro Barrios said Saturday.
	   El Salvador _ where 140 people died in flash flooding _ declared
a state of emergency, as did Guatemala, where 21 people died when
floods swept away their homes. Mexico reported one death from Mitch
last Monday.
	   In western Guatemala, a C-47 cargo plane crashed Sunday, killing
12 people aboard and injuring six. The accident may have been
caused by bad weather associated with '2ec, according to officials
at the Guatemala City international airport.
	   In the Caribbean, the U.S. Coast Guard widened a search for a
tourist schooner with 31 people aboard that hasn't been heard from
since Tuesday.
	   By late Sunday, Mitch's winds, once near 180 mph (290 kph), had
dropped to near 30 mph (50 kph), and the storm _ now classified as
a tropical depression _ was near Tapachula, on Mexico's southern
Pacific coast near the Guatemalan border.
	   Mitch was moving west at 8 mph (12 kph) and was dissipating but
threatened to strengthen again if it moved back out to sea.

Dollar slips in Tokyo, Japanese stocks higher in early trading
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with midmorning trading

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stocks edged higher Monday morning after
two major banks announced they would form an alliance. The U.S.
dollar fell against the yen.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 203.79 points, or 1.50
percent, ending the morning session at 13,768.30 points. On Friday,
the average closed down 104.21 points, or 0.76 percent.
	   Traders said investors pushed up banking shares after two of
Japan's largest banks _ Fuji Bank Ltd. and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank
Ltd. _ said Saturday that they may form a strategic alliance in a
key business area.
	   ``Investors favored the move by the two banks to restructure
their operations to survive at this very difficult time for
banks,'' said Masaru Arai, general manager of the stock division at
Ryoko Securities.
	   A proposed merger of the banks' trust banking operations would
be the first such link between top-ranked Japanese lenders. It was
the latest tie-up designed to cope with increased competition, a
recessionary economy and huge loads of bad loan.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section of the stock exchange was up 21.47 points, or 2.07
percent, to 1,057.07. The TOPIX closed down 1.50 points, or 0.41
percent, on Friday.
	   A gain in New York stocks Friday also gave a boost to
international blue-chip shares, traders said.
	   In currency dealings, the dollar bought 114.69 yen, down 1.39
yen from late Friday in Tokyo and also below its New York level of
116.14 yen late Friday.
	   Traders said the dollar's slide was triggered by expectations of
further cuts in U.S. interest rates. Lower rates make
interest-bearing securities less attractive and tend to reduce
demand for a country's currency.
	   The dollar's dip also stemmed from a Group of Seven
industrialized nations' endorsement last week of reforms in Brazil,
which was seen as good news for emerging markets, including those
in Asia, traders said.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese
government bond stood at 0.810 percent, down from Friday's close of
0.820 percent, driving up its price to 108.83 yen from 108.73 yen.

Southern Chinese official, family punished for corruption
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A senior official in southern China's Guangdong
province has been found guilty of using his influence to drive up
land prices and pocket illegal income, the official newspaper China
Daily reported Monday.
	   Yu Fei, former vice chairman of the provincial legislature's
Standing Committee, and his family were ordered to pay a fine of 83
million yuan (dlrs 10 million).
	   The government has also confiscated 166 million yuan (dlrs 20
million) in illegal income derived from the land sales, the report
said.
	   The newspaper said Yu used his power to force local officials in
Daya Bay, Guangdong, to sell 220 hectares (544 acres) of land to
companies owned by his children. The report did not explain the
specifics of the transactions, which presumably involved buying the
land below value and then selling it for a much higher price.
	   The report said Yu and his family had not paid the fines, which
were decreed back in April, and were facing ``coercive measures.''
	   Yu's misdeed was ``very odious, caused serious damages to state
land property and brought about bad social aftermaths,'' the report
cited Ministry of Land and Resources officials as saying.
	   The ruling Communist Party already had punished Yu by expelling
him. He was one of the higher ranked among thousands of officials
who have fallen afoul of the law in a five-year campaign against
endemic corruption.
	   The central government has recently focused special attention on
Guangdong province, which because of its proximity to Hong Kong and
its tradition of resisting Beijing's control is one of China's
wealthiest and most freewheeling regions.

Sumitomo Trust, Chase Manhattan to jointly develop mutual fund
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Sumitomo Trust and Banking Co. and Chase Manhattan
Bank of the United States will jointly develop a dollar-denominated
investment trust for selling in Japan, a Sumitomo spokesman said
Monday.
	   The agreement comes just one month before Japan lifts a ban on
selling such mutual funds through bank counters on Dec. 1, Sumitomo
Trust said.
	   The Sumitomo-Chase deal will be the first case of a Japanese
bank developing a foreign currency-denominated mutual fund, said
Sumitomo Trust spokesman Noriyuki Hashimoto. Trust will be in U.S.
dollars.
	   The new fund, to be sold through Sumitomo Trust's branches
across Japan, will be managed by Chase Manhattan Management, an
asset-management division of the New York-based Chase Manhattan
Bank group, Hashimoto said.
	   The fund will mainly be invested in highly rated debt
instruments such as U.S. Treasury Bills, Hashimoto said. The
minimum purchase amount will be dlrs 3,000, he said.
	   The agreement followed a customer survey in May that showed
Sumitomo Trust's depositors are interested in investing in foreign
mutual funds, while seeking stable and low-risk returns from the
funds, Hashimoto said.
	   As Japan's ``Big Bang'' financial deregulation is now under way,
major banks and financial companies are seen entering the mutual
fund market to take a part of Japanese personal assets worth an
estimated 1,200 trillion yen (dlrs 10.43 trillion).
	   Last December the Japanese government permitted investment
advisory companies to sell investment trusts, which are commonly
known as mutual funds in the United States, on bank premises.
	   Starting in Dec. 1, this year, banks will be allowed to sell
investment trusts by themselves.

Indonesian military denies it launched offensive in East Timor
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: INCORPORATES story slugged Portugal-East Timor

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The Indonesian military on Monday
denied a claim by an East Timorese resistance leader that it had
launched an offensive against pro-independence rebels in the
disputed territory.
	   Nobel Peace Prize laureate Jose Ramos Horta said Sunday that
2,000 Indonesian troops backed by helicopters were attacking rebels
near Los Palos on the eastern side of the former Portuguese colony.
	   However, a military spokesman in East Timor said the accusation
was part of a disinformation campaign against Indonesia, which has
opened peace talks with Portugal under the auspices of the United
Nations.
	   ``There was no attack in Los Palos, and we're not conducting
combat operations anymore,'' Lt. Col. Supadi said by telephone from
Dili, the capital of East Timor.
	   ``Ramos Horta's story is in his own interest,'' Supadi said.
``If Ramos Horta didn't tell stories about East Timor, he wouldn't
be able to get help for his campaign.''
	   Ramos Horta said resistance sources in the Indonesian capital,
Jakarta, were informed about the attack by a guerrilla commander
inside East Timor. Ramos Horta, who lives in Australia, made the
accusation while attending a meeting of East Timorese activists in
Krumbach, Austria.
	   Supadi said the military was on alert in case of demonstrations
on the anniversary of a massacre of separatist protesters at Santa
Cruz cemetery in Dili on Nov. 12, 1991.
	   An official investigation said about 50 people died. Critics of
the government claimed as many as 200 were slain.
	   The Indonesian military is also investigating whether
pro-independence activists were involved in the killings of three
soldiers and a civilian on Friday in East Timor. A fourth soldier
was missing and believed killed.
	   East Timorese activists claim the number of Indonesian troops in
the half-island territory is more than 21,000, far in excess of the
number claimed by the Indonesian government.
	   The Indonesian military has said there are 15,000 soldiers,
including 5,000 troops engaged in community work such as health
care and engineering.
	   Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975 and annexed it the
following year. The United Nations does not recognize Indonesian
rule.

Khabibulin shuts out Kings
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) _ Nikolai Khabibulin earned his 14th
career shutout with 31 saves Sunday as the Phoenix Coyotes dealt
the punchless Los Angeles Kings their third shutout loss in four
games with a 3-0 victory.
	   The Kings, blanked 3-0 by Tampa Bay's Daren Puppa on Friday
night, have gone scoreless in consecutive home games for only the
second time in the team's 32-year history and the first time since
December 1967. They lost 3-0 decisions to Philadelphia and
Minnesota during their inaugural season, two weeks before moving
into the Forum.
	   Jyrki Lumme and Jeremy Roenick scored and Rick Tocchet added a
shorthanded goal to support Khabibulin's first shutout since last
Jan. 1, when he blanked Los Angeles 4-0 at Phoenix. The Kings'
current drought is 126 minutes and 12 seconds.
 &UR; Senators 5, Flyers 4
	   In Philadelphia, Steve Martins and Radek Bonk scored goals
within 1:43 late in the third period to lead the Ottawa Senators
over the Philadelphia Flyers.
	   Jason York, Shawn McEachern, and Chris Murray also scored in the
third straight win for the Senators. Former Flyer Vaclav Prospal
had three assists for the Senators.
	   John LeClair scored twice for Philadelphia. The Flyers also got
goals from Eric Lindros, who is tied for the NHL lead with eight,
and Shjon Podein.
	   The Flyers lost their third straight after twice battling back
from two-goal deficits.

British soldier killed in car crash
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SUFFIELD, Alberta (AP) _ A British soldier died after his
vehicle flipped on a gravel road near an army training area in
southwestern Alberta.
	   Darren Milton, 23, was thrown from his vehicle in the crash
Sunday near Suffield, Alberta, about 250 kilometers (155 miles)
southeast of Calgary.
	   Milton was not wearing a seat-belt. The road conditions and
weather were not a factor in the crash, police said.
	   Milton, who was married and had two children, was completing a
five-month stint at the training base, said Capt. Gary Thompson.
	   He was the second British soldier to die from a traffic mishap
in two weeks.
	   A 19-year-old member of the Irish Guards died last week when a
Land Rover flipped over during a training exercise. Two other
soldiers were hurt in that accident.

Death toll from floods in central Vietnam reaches 52
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ The death toll from floods in central
Vietnam has risen to 52, a government official said Monday.
	   Dinh Tien Lien of the Central Floods and Storm Control Committee
said 17 people had died in Binh Dinh province, 14 in Khanh Hoa, 12
in Quang Ngai, four in Phu Yen and five in Ninh Thuan.
	   Most of the victims were fishermen, other included students and
villagers who were swept away by flash floods, Lien said.
	   Downpours of 300 to 500 millimeters (20 to 34 inches) on Oct.
20-22 submerged large swaths of land, destroyed 378 houses and
damaged some rice fields and roads, Lien said.
	   Damage has been estimated at 191 billion dong (dlrs 13.7
million), a huge amount for one of Vietnam's poorest regions.
	   Lien said the government has sent a delegation to assess
situation and provided 1 million dong (dlrs 70) to each family who
lost a home or relative.
	   The Binh Dinh provincial floods and storms control committee is
providing hungry families with eight kilograms (18 pounds) of rice
per person for three months, he said.
	   Until mid-August, the region was suffering from its worst
drought in at least half a century.

Faithful Son favored in Australia's top race
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ England's Faithful Son heads a long
and controversial list of foreign invaders chasing Australia's
greatest racing prize, the Melbourne Cup, at Flemington on Tuesday.
	   The so-called ``race that stops the nation'' has been tainted by
bickering over the 24-horse field to tackle the Aust dlrs 2.8
million (U.S. 1.75 million) handicap over 3,200-meters (two-miles).
	   A record seven international horses _ five from England and two
from Singapore _ made the field, leaving the connections of
rejected Australian entrants crying in their beer.
	   The Victorian Racing Club opted to use its special powers to
lift Yorkshire into the field ahead of two Australian chances which
had qualified in higher positions.
	   Yorkshire has won just two races in its career but was second in
the Queen Alexandra Stakes at Ascot in June and at last start was
fifth in Britain's best staying handicap, the Tote Ebor at York.
	   Tim White, whose Bulta was kicked out to allow Yorkshire into
the field, was a fierce opponent of the VRC's decision.
	   ``I'm devastated and there's nothing I can do about it,'' White
said. ``Whatever happened to the dream that a battler could try and
win the Melbourne Cup? As of now, it's gone.''
	   But Yorkshire's trainer Paul Cole believes the five-year-old has
the ability to become the first non-Australasian winner since
Ireland's Vintage Crop in 1993.
	   ``He has a great turn of foot and he will get the trip,'' Cole
said. ``I think we're in with a serious chance.''
	   Yorkshire was quoted at 25-1 on Monday while Faithful Son was
the 9-2 favorite.
	   Faithful Son is part of England's powerful Godolphin stable and
is trained by Saeed bin Suroor. It will be ridden by the world's
top jockey Frankie Dettori.
	   Dettori is yet to win in Australia and was verbally pounded by
fans on the weekend when he took the heavily-backed Annus Mirabilis
to a 10-length lead in the Mackinnon Stakes at Flemington, only to
finish fourth.
	   But Dettori shrugged off the criticism and it appears the
biggest question over Faithful Son is the race distance.
	   The five-year-old gelding has never run close to the 3,200
meters (two miles) and its best result was over 2000 meters in this
year's Prince of Wales Stakes at Royal Ascot.
	   ``The trip is the question, but you'd have to fear him,'' said
David Elsworth, who trains another English chance Persian Punch
(12-1). ``They aren't here for the beer.''
	   Bin Suroor can't guarantee Faithful Son will conquer the
distance but he would not be here if he did not rate its chances.
	   ``The Cup is the biggest two-mile handicap in the world and we
have spared no expense in coming here,'' Bin Suroor said. ''Two
miles is the only concern because it's his first time. The way he
races I think he will get the distance and with luck he will win.''
	   Faithful Son has enjoyed his share fortune, taking gate No.8.
Australia's leading hopes had the worst draws of all with Tie The
Knot in 22, Aerosmith in 23 and 1995 winner Doriemus in 24.
	   The other internationals are British runners Sheer Danzig and
Taufan's Melody (both 14-1) and Singapore-based Three Crowns (33-1)
and Peak of Perfection (100-1).
	   The state of Victoria takes a public vacation for the day of the
Cup, which is run at 1520 local time. The rest of the nation comes
to standstill, as office workers take part in sweeps and watch the
event on television or at special lunches.

Nine people killed in fighting in Kashmir
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAMMU, India (AP) _ Security forces fought gunbattles with
separatists in India's northern Kashmir state, killing eight of
them and losing one soldier in two encounters, police said Monday.
	   A third gunbattle was in progress in Rajouri district which
borders Pakistan. India accuses its neighbor of backing the nine
year-old insurgency in Kashmir. Pakistan denies the charge, saying
the support is only moral and political.
	   Police said the eight militants killed late Tuesday were
Pakistani nationals belonging to the Lashkar-e-Toiba, one of more
than two dozen groups fighting for independence from India or to
merge with neighboring Pakistan.
	   K. Rajendra, Deputy Inspector General of Police in Rajouri, 180
kilometers (110 miles) from Kashmir's winter capital Jammu, said
security forces stormed a militant hide-out in the area, killing
four men. One soldier died in the fighting.
	   Another operation took place in the high mountains of the Pir
Panjal range, Rajendra said, in which four militants were killed.
There were no army casualties in the fighting that lasted more than
six hours, he said.
	   The three gunbattles are part of a fresh army offensive to
target militants who are losing safe cover because of approaching
winter. The intense cold is forcing militants to descend from the
remote mountains to inhabited areas in the foothills, where food is
more easily available.
	   This has exposed them to the public and made them vulnerable to
security forces who find it easier to hunt them down, Rajendra
said.

Collapse of world's tallest joss sticks kill five in Thailand
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ At least five people were killed and 13
others injured Monday when three soaring columns collapsed on top
of worshipers at a Buddhist temple west of Bangkok, provincial
authorities said.
	   The 27-meter-high (88-feet) columns, known as the world's
tallest joss sticks, were completed last April at one of Thailand's
most sacred sites, the Phra Pathom Jedi Pagoda in Nakorn Pathom, 50
kilometers (31 miles) from Bangkok.
	   An official who requested anonymity said the accident followed
heavy rains, but a cause for the collapse was not immediately
known.
	   The tube-like columns were built of metal and had been festooned
with tons of joss sticks -- thin wooden sticks covered with a
fragrant dried paste which are burned as incense in religious
ceremonies and during prayer.
	   The provincial official, who was reached by telephone, said four
people were killed instantly by the falling metal structures, while
a fourth died later a local hospital.
	   Rescue unit were searching for others possibly trapped under the
wreckage.
	   The pagoda said the three edifices had been recognized as the
world's tallest joss sticks.
