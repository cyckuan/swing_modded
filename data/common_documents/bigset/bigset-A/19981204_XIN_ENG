<HEADLINE> Clinton Asks Advice on Fate of Israeli Spy Pollard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
has asked senior officials to offer recommendations by January 11
on whether convicted Israeli spy Jonathan Pollard should be
granted clemency, a White House official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The president will make his decision "in a timely manner" after
receiving the recommendations, National Security Council spokesman
David Leavy said.
</P>
<P>
Pollard's release was sought by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu as a last-minute condition in the Mideast peace
agreement at Wye River Plantation on Maryland's Eastern Shore in
October.
</P>
<P>
The issue threw the talks off track until Clinton promised to
take a fresh look at clemency for Pollard.
</P>
<P>
Leavy said Clinton "never made a determination to release Mr.
Pollard. He consulted with his advisers at Wye, came to the
conclusion this was not something he was prepared to do at Wye and
he made his own decision to take a fresh look at this case and to
consult all the appropriate agencies."
</P>
<P>
The extraordinary handling of the case reflects its highly
charged political sensitivity. "It's fair to say that other
clemency cases to not raise the same questions as the case of Mr.
Pollard," Leavy said.
</P>
<P>
Pollard, an former U.S. naval intelligence officer, is serving
a life sentence for handing over thousands of top-secret U.S.
documents to Israel in 1984 and 1985.
</P>
<P>
White House counsel Charles F.C. Ruff, acting on Clinton's
behalf, sent letters Nov. 16 to Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, Defense Secretary William Cohen, CIA Director George
Tenet and Attorney General Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
The letters asked for any information that might bear on
Clinton's consideration of clemency for Pollard along with any
recommendations they might wish to make, Leavy said.
</P>
<P>
The letter further requested that all relevant agencies,
including the FBI, Defense Intelligence Agency and National
Security Agency, be included in the process.
</P>
<P>
At the Wye Plantation talks, Tenet vehemently opposed Pollard's
release and told Clinton it would be impossible for him to
continue as director if the convicted spy were freed, according to
a Clinton administration official.

<HEADLINE> Red Cross Calls for Universal Ratification of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The International Committee of
the Red Cross (ICRC) has urged all states to sign and/or ratify
without delay the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use,
Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and
on their Destruction if they have not yet done so.
</P>
<P>
The convention, known as Ottawa treaty, was signed by 123
states in Ottawa, Canada a year ago and the number of
ratifications (40) needed to bring the treaty into force was
reached on September 16, 1998, a record time for an arms-related
treaty.
</P>
<P>
While welcoming the speed at which the Ottawa treaty has been
ratified, ICRC President Cornelio Sommaruga stressed here Thursday
that "landmines pay no attention to treaties".
</P>
<P>
"It is only when states fulfil their obligation to clear mines,
destroy stockpiles and assist victims that the treaty will begin
to save lives," said Sommaruga, adding that the real challenge was
to mobilize the resources needed to implement the Ottawa treaty at
national and international levels.
</P>
<P>
"The tragic lesson to be drawn from the recent floods in
Central America is that mines can go on many years after they
have been laid," said the ICRC president. "They can also travel to
areas many kilometers away. Every day counts."
</P>
<P>
A total of 131 states have now signed the treaty and 55 have
ratified it. The treaty will enter into force on March 1, 1999 for
the 40 states that ratified it by September 16, 1998. It takes six
months for a country which ratifies the treaty to implement it.

<HEADLINE> France Lowers Banking Rate in Expectation of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 3 (Xinhua) -- France Thursday decided to lower
its key banking interest rate, the tenders rate, from 3.3 percent
to 3.0 percent, in expectation of slower growth in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The French central bank, Banque de France, said that the
decision was made in concertation with other European central
banks and is aimed at keeping the confidence of households and
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Another key interest rate, the short-term borrowing rate, is
kept unchanged at 4.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The president of the board of management of Banque de France,
Jean-Claude Trichet, said that the international environment
remains uncertain and a certain slowdown in the growth is expected
in the whole euro zone in 1999.
</P>
<P>
But he said that the stability of the French franc and the
European single currency euro will be ensured.
</P>
<P>
The French Minister of Finance and Economy Dominique
Strauss-Kahn said on Wednesday for the first time that the French
economy is not on the ``slope'' of 2.7 percent as is previously
expected for 1999.
</P>
<P>
The exchange rate of the French franc with the U.S. dollar has
remained over-valued for months at around one dollar for 5.7
francs.
</P>
<P>
The single currency will be formally launched one month later
by 11 countries of the European Union.

<HEADLINE> EU Rejects U.S. Proposal Over Banana Regime Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)
rejected on Thursday the United States' demand to change the EU's
banana regime.
</P>
<P>
The EU said it wishes to resume discussions to bridge the
differences once the EU and the U.S. have "agreed on a mutually
acceptable dispute settlement procedure."
</P>
<P>
In response to a letter from U.S. Trade Representative Charlene
Barshefsky, European Commission Vice-President Leon Brittan said
the United States apparently wants to break off negotiations and
resort to actions which may lead to a major trade dispute between
the EU and the United States and damage the World Trade
Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
He said he felt disappointed when he received the letter this
morning and knew the EU and the United States would not be able to
reach an agreement on a timetable for an accelerated WTO panel on
the EU banana regime.
</P>
<P>
Brittan said in his letter to Barshefsky that the EU does not
think it would make sense for the United States to take
retaliatory actions against the EU because its proposal provides
the United States with the opportunity to obtain a definitive,
independent resolution on a dispute that has been running for some
years.
</P>
<P>
The dispute might be settled in a few weeks after March 3,
1999, the deadline the United States set for resorting to
retaliatory actions.
</P>
<P>
However, the vice president said the EU "remains ready to
continue the discussions" if the United States would give its
decision a second thought.

<HEADLINE> Britain Welcomes Annan's Planned Trip to Libya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Britain welcomed on Thursday UN
Secretary-General Kofi Annan's announcement that he would visit
Libya to discuss the hand-over of two men who are responsible for
the Lockerbie airliner bombing.
</P>
<P>
The plan to try the Libyan suspects before a special court of
Scottish judges in the Netherlands was non-negotiable, a British
official said.
</P>
<P>
Annan announced on Thursday that he would travel to Libya on
Saturday to meet Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi and discuss the
hand-over of the suspects.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the secretary-general can persuade Gaddafi to reply
promptly so justice can be done," the official said.
</P>
<P>
Gaddafi, who agreed to the trial plan in theory earlier this
year said last Sunday that Britain and the United States were
still trying to impose unacceptable conditions and were refusing
to make concessions.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Britain promised Libya unrestricted consular
access to the suspects if they were jailed in Scotland.
</P>
<P>
The UN Security Council imposed an air and arms embargo on
Libya, expanding it in 1993, to include a freeze on Libyan assets
abroad and a ban on oil equipment.

UNITED NATIONS, December 3 (Xinhua) -- A committee of the
United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization
(UNESCO) has expanded its list of cultural and natural sites
around the world that it designates as having "exceptional
universal value," a U.N. release said here on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Former Ukrainian PM Arrested in Switzerland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine's former prime minister
Pavlo Lazarenko was brought to Geneva Thursday for investigation
after being arrested in the northern Swiss city of Basle when he
entered Switzerland in a car from France Wednesday, according to
the Swiss news agency, ATS.
</P>
<P>
The news agency said that 45-year-old Lazarenko and his aid
were wanted by Ukrainian authorities on suspicion of having
embezzled public money worth 20 million U.S. dollars and deposited
in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
Lazarenko, prime minister from June 1996 to June 1997, is now a
parliamentary deputy and heads the influential Hromada (Community)
left-center movement which strongly opposes President Leonid
Kuchma.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Kiev cited the president of the commission for
foreign affairs as saying that Ukraine is waiting for the
explanations about Lazarenko's arrest from the Swiss authorities.

<HEADLINE> UK's Tory Party in Crisis After Lords Leader Sacked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Britain's opposition
Conservative Party leader William Hague's leadership was in deep
crisis after five Conservative peers resigned on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Deputy leader Lord Fraser and four other Tory peers resigned in
protest against Hague's decision on Wednesday to sack Tory's
leader in the House of Lords Viscount Cranborne.
</P>
<P>
Hague sacked Lord Cranborne after he brokered a deal with the
government - without his leader's authority - to keep 91
hereditary peers during the first phase of House of Lords reform.
The sacking plunged the Tory party into crisis.
</P>
<P>
Opposition frontbench spokesmen Lord Bowness, Lord Pilkington
and the Earl of Home quit their posts hours after Lord Fraser
announced he was standing down. Baroness Strange announced she was
quitting the Tory party for the crossbenches.
</P>
<P>
Even the man chosen to replace Viscount Cranborne, Lord
Strathclyde, revealed he had offered his resignation which had
been rejected by Hague who instead asked him to take over the top
job in the upper House.
</P>
<P>
Lord Fraser said Hague had made a "serious mistake" in sacking
Lord Cranborne and there was widespread speculation in Westminster
that Hague had lost his grip of his own party.
</P>
<P>
The Tory leader hit back, insisting he had the "emphatic
support" of his MPs.
</P>
<P>
"We had a serious problem yesterday and I have dealt with that.
I am going to rebuild my party on the basis of discipline whether
people like that or not," Hague said.
</P>
<P>
Even though most believe he will be able to remain as leader,
if for no other reason than the fact that there is no obvious
alternative candidate, there is little doubt his leadership has
suffered its most serious crisis yet.

<HEADLINE> Disaster '99 Conf Scheduled in Nairobi in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The first East African
Conference on Disaster Management for Businesses is scheduled in
the Kenyan capital in February, 1999, the Nairobi-based Untied
Nations Center for Human Settlements (Habitat) said.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the conference is to bring together
professionals within the business community to share and learn
the lessons from the August 7 Nairobi bombing so that they can be
better prepared, the Habitat said in a press release available
here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Topics to be discussed at the meeting will include
vulnerability analysis, insurance coverage, the implementation of
a business continuity plan, re-establishment of computer and
telecommunications system and protecting logistics lifelines.
</P>
<P>
Being prepared is not only good for businesses but also
benefits all people, Habitat acting Executive Director Klaus
Toepfer said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the business community have a critical role to
play in protecting their employees, customers and their
surrounding neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
International studies indicate that on average only 30 percent
of companies are still in operation within three years of a major
disaster.
</P>
<P>
The Habitat noted the key to survival depends largely upon the
ability to muster an immediate, effective and accurate response.
In short, the businesses cannot afford to be caught unprepared.
</P>
<P>
The conference is to be organized by the Financial Mail with
the support of Habitat and other organizations including Kenya
Airways.

<HEADLINE> African Parliamentarian Seminar Starts in Harare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 3 (Xinhua) -- A two-day African
parliamentarian seminar began in Zimbabwean capital Harare
Thursday to discuss the role and functioning of parliaments in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
At the opening ceremony, Zimbabwean Speaker of Parliament
Cyril Ndebele said that legislators should ensure their
independence by not relying solely on information provided by
lobbyists and agencies of the executive.
</P>
<P>
The speaker said there was an urgent need by African
parliaments to have an independent and comprehensive information
and research service from which the legislature could draw.
</P>
<P>
In most cases, he said, governments had a monopoly of
information which would be biased toward the executive.
</P>
<P>
Ndebele also said that democracy and good governance could not
flourish where decisions of national significance were made
secretly without consulting civil society.
</P>
<P>
He said strengthening legislature in developing countries
should not be seen as competition with the executive but was a
way to enable them to play their constitutional and complementary
roles in governance.
</P>
<P>
The two-day Global Coalition for Africa meeting was being
attended by participants from 21 countries.
</P>
<P>
It would focus on issues relating to competent functioning of
parliaments and development of expertise.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Unemployment Claims Pick Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The number of first-time
applications for unemployment benefits rose last week, the Labor
Department said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Jobless claims increased by 12,000 to a seasonally adjusted
313,000, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
However, it was still below the level of early November. But a
four-week moving average rose by 250 to a seasonally adjusted
319,250.
</P>
<P>
That was the highest level since July, when the General Motors
strikes increased the number of claims. Excluding the GM strike,
the four-week average hit a 10-month high.
</P>
<P>
Due largely to loss of sales abroad, primarily in East Asia,
the U.S. manufacturers had to slash payrolls by nearly 200,000
jobs and the nation's unemployment rate has crept to 4.6 percent
from a 28-year low of 4.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The latest evidence of the negative impact came this week when
Boeing Co., the world's largest aerospace company, announced it
would lay off 20,000 workers, bringing its planned job cuts
announced since the summer to 48,000.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia to Exert Efforts to Boost Coffee Income </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia's Coffee and Tea
Authority said Thursday that it is exerting maximum efforts to
boost the revenue from coffee export.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ethiopian News Agency, Tsegaye Berhane,
General Manager of the authority, told journalists that a slump
in the world coffee price is feared in 1998/99 as a result of
high production of the crop in coffee producing countries like
Brazil.
</P>
<P>
Tsegaye said that a slump in the world price of coffee could
have a domino effect on the price of Ethiopia coffee in the
international auction.
</P>
<P>
Coffee is Ethiopia's most important export commodity and
contributes to about 60 percent of the export income.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopian Minister of Trade and Industry Kasahun Ayele
announced here last month that the income from coffee export
takes a 63.6 percent share of its export planned in 1998/99 (July
8, 1998-July 7, 1999).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tsegaye urged the coffee producers and traders not
to keep the crop in storage for an extended period of time.
</P>
<P>
A sizable quantity of coffee is kept in storage by Ethiopian
farmers and traders, according to the authority.
</P>
<P>
"If coffee is stored for a long time, it will lose its quality
and taste," the general manager said, adding that "this will, in
turn, have a dire consequence on the value of Ethiopian coffee in
the world market."

<HEADLINE> Tanzania's Trade Account Improves: C. Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's trade account
during October improved by 33 percent, reducing deficit by 26.5
million U.S. Dollars over the previous month, the Bank of
Tanzania said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
This improvement was largely due to an increase in export
earnings by 67.2 percent, which more than offset the effect of
1.9 percent increase in import bill, the central bank said in its
latest monthly economic review.
</P>
<P>
The increase in export earnings originated from the
traditional sector whose earnings more than doubled, said the
November issue report.
</P>
<P>
During the year ending October 1998, the trade account
recorded a deficit of 788.3 million Dollars, representing a 28.5
percent increase compared with a deficit of 613.6 million Dollars
recorded during the corresponding period last year, it added.
</P>
<P>
The trade account deficit worsened during the reviewing period
primarily because of a significant decline in export earnings
coupled with an increase of the import bill, it said.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Presidential Ban on Strikes Tabled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean Ministry of Public
Service, Labor and Social Welfare Thursday tabled before
parliament the presidential powers (temporary measures)
regulations meant to ban strikes under the labor regulations.
</P>
<P>
The presidential decree comes at a time when actions by the
labor movement, the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions, are blamed
for inflicting huge damages on the economy.
</P>
<P>
In a parliamentary address regarding the presidential powers
promulgated on November 27 this year, Minister Florence Chitauro
said there were procedural requirements to amend a piece of
legislation and yet there was need to amend the law in order to
protect the economy, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The government, she said, could not wait for the amendment
processes of the labor relations act in order to include strikes
among illegal mass actions.
</P>
<P>
"These stay-aways have damaged the economy and the government
believes that the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions is taking
advantage of the inadequacies in our labor legislation, as the
current labor relations act does not adequately address the issue
of stay-aways," said Chitauro.
</P>
<P>
"The decision to bring on board the issue of stay-away
legislatively through the presidential powers does not mean that
the government had abandoned the much-cherished dialog," said the
minister.
</P>
<P>
"It is merely a measure to govern a collective action which
was omitted and now being resorted by labor organization," she
said, adding that dialog would continue.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Urged Not to Deploy Russian Missiles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. has urged the Cypriot
government not to deploy Russian anti-aircraft missiles on the
island, U.S. Ambassador to Cyprus Kenneth Brill said here Thursday
after his meeting with Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides.
</P>
<P>
"We have always supported the idea of the missiles not
coming to Cyprus. As long as they are not coming to Cyprus,
we are ready to consider almost anything else," the Ambassador
said.
</P>
<P>
And the U.S. supports the ongoing U.N.-sponsored shuttle talks
which Secretary-General Kofi Annan's envoy in Cyprus Dame Ann
Hercus is conducting, he added.
</P>
<P>
Brill said the arrival of the missiles "complicates the process
of getting to the demilitarization of Cyprus," adding that "we
hope that the position we have taken from the beginning that they
should not come to Cyprus is the one that will be adopted by the
government of Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
Asked if the U.N. process would be facilitated if the
missiles do not arrive in Cyprus, Brill said that the U.S.
would not want to see things happen that would detract from
that process.
</P>
<P>
"The arrival of the missiles would detract from that," he
stressed, noting that the ongoing U.N. process is all the
more reason for the U.S. position to be adhered to.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus signed a deal with Russia in January 1997 to buy S-300
anti-aircraft missiles in a bid to booster its defense.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and other western countries have criticized Cyprus
for the deal, and Turkey have threatened to launch pre-emptive
military strikes if the missiles are deployed on the island.
</P>
<P>
Brill said the U.S. initiative to break the current deadlock
in Cyprus runs parallel to that of the U.N. and expressed
strong support to the U.N. process.
</P>
<P>
"Dame Ann has the strongest possible support from the U.S.
government and other members of the U.N. Security Council," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated
south and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since Turkey landed
its troops and took over the northern third of the island in
1974 following a failed pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots declared unilaterally in 1983 a
breakaway "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus," which was
recognized only by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been trying for decades to reunite the
island through a bi-communal formula, but no results have been
achieved.

would be a left-right coalition of three parties.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit, leader of the center-left Democratic Left Party (DSP),

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Needs $4.5M to Dispose Obsolete </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, December 3 (xinhua) -- Ethiopia Thursday said
that along with the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) it is
looking for donors to fund the 4.5 million U.S. Dollars needed to
dispose obsolete pesticides in the country.
</P>
<P>
Bateno Kabeto, an official from the Ethiopian Ministry of
Agriculture, told a meeting here that there are 1,152 tons of
obsolete pesticides and more than 100 tons of contaminated
equipment and soil in the country.
</P>
<P>
The official said some of these chemicals are over 40 years
old while some have become unrecognized as their labels were lost
or mixed up with a cocktail of different types of pesticides.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the meeting, Alemayehu Wodajeneh, FAO's obsolete
pesticide coordinator, said that Morocco is at the top followed
by Ethiopia and Tanzania in obsolete pesticide stock in Africa.
</P>
<P>
He said that 80 to 100 million Dollars is needed to dispose
expired pesticides in Africa.

<HEADLINE> International Symposium on DU Impacts Concludes in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 3 (Xinhua) -- People who were affected by
depleted uranium (DU) in the 1991 Gulf War should be compensated,
said a statement issued here Thursday at the conclusion of an
international symposium on the use of DU and its impacts on man
and environment.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day meeting, which started on Wednesday,
participants discussed the grave effects of the U.S.-British use
of banned DU shells against Iraq on its coming generations and on
other states in the region.
</P>
<P>
The symposium brought together more than 200 experts and
specialists from the U.S., Britain, Canada, Germany, Jordan,
Tunisia and Iraq, and some U.S. and British veterans who had
participated in the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Two sessions were held Thursday to discuss scientific research
findings on the issue. One research indicates that large
landscapes in southern Iraq have been polluted by DU radiations,
referring to the increase in cancer cases among Iraqi soldiers,
especially the spread of leukemia.
</P>
<P>
Another research shows that barrenness cases have more
than doubled in the Iraqi province of Basrah, and at the
same time, cases of congenital deformities have also doubled,
notably in the southern provinces.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. allegations that the Gulf War was a clean war
were not true, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi troops invaded Kuwait in August 1990, touching off the
1991 Gulf War. During the 43-day war, the U.S. and Britain
dropped some 700-800 tons of DU shells in Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Tietmeyer: Rate-Cutting not under Political Pressure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, December 3 (Xinhua) -- In a concerted action, 11 European
banks were cutting their key interest rates to a nearly-uniform
3.0 per cent on Thursday. But the German Bundesbank's president
Hans Tietmeyer promised at the same day, that was not owing to any
political pressure.
</P>
<P>
The Bundesbank cut its security repurchase offer - an
instrument providing short-term liquidity to banks - to 3.0 per
cent from the 3.30 per cent level which has been unchanged since
October 1997.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, Tietmeyer said the rate cut decision
had been taken after consultations with other 10 central banks as
well as with the European Central Bank (ECB), the institution
which on January 1, 1999 will be guiding the fortunes of the
European Monetary Union and the single currency, the euro.
</P>
<P>
Tietmeyer stressed that the rate cut move of the German
Bundesbank, which took most financial market experts completely by
surprise, was a "sovereign decision of the Bundesbank,
uninfluenced by political expectations".
</P>
<P>
And that, all other 10 central banks lowered their rates, did
not take place due to political pressure, too, he said.
</P>
<P>
Tietmeyer said that after intensive analysis by the ECB and the
Bundesbank, it was determined that a "further coordinated rate
cut is called for in order to guide downward the central banks'
rates at the start of the European Monetary Union to 3.0 per
cent".
</P>
<P>
The German Finance Ministry issued a statement at the same day
welcoming the rate cut, calling the decision one which would
contribute to more growth and employment.

<HEADLINE> "Devilish Lovers" Extradited Back to Belgium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 3 (Xinhua) -- A Belgian couple, known as the
"Devilish Lovers" and suspected of killing their respective spouse
in order to claim colossal amounts of life insurance, were
extradited on Thursday from the United States to Belgium.
</P>
<P>
Aurore Martin and Peter Hue-Schmidt, detained in mid-November
1997 in Miami of the United States at the request of the Belgian
jurisdiction, were finally extradited to Brussels after 12 months
of legal entanglement.
</P>
<P>
The two was scheduled to be interrogated by Brussels' municipal
judge, Damien Vandermeersch.
</P>
<P>
Aurore Martin and Peter Hue-Schmidt were suspected of
murdering, via traffic accidents, their respective spouse in 1992
and then in 1995 so as to claim as much as a combined life
insurance of more than 40 million Belgian francs (1.1 million U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The two were accused of having planned to start a luxurious
life in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The Aurore Martin and Peter Hue-Schmidt team reportedly made
the most of the loopholes of American legislation to set back
their extradition back to Belgium.

<HEADLINE> Annan to Meet Libyan Leader on Lockerbie Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 3 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan will meet with Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi on
Saturday to discuss the 1988 Lockerbie airliner bombing, a U.N.
spokesman said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. spokesman, Manoel de Almeida e Silva told a press
conference that Annan revealed the planned visit on Thursday after
meeting with Tunisian Foreign Minister Said Ben Mustapha in Tunis,
capital of Tunisia.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman quoted the U.N. chief as saying at a news
conference in Tunis, "Yes, I will go to Libya on Saturday. We are
going to look at solutions to the problem." Asked if he would meet
Gaddafi, Annan replied, "Yes, I believe so."
</P>
<P>
"Of course, he (Annan) was to help improve and find good
results and solve an impasse," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Annan on Wednesday asked a Security Council sanctions committee
for permission to break a U.N. air embargo and fly either to
Tripoli, the Libyan capital, or Sirte, a coastal city some 450
kilometers east of Triopli, U.N. sources said. The spokesman also
confirmed that Annan has got permission from the committee to go
ahead with his flight into Libya.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.N. spokesman, asked about where Annan would meet
with Gaddafi, told reporters that "the details of the trip at this
point must be kept confidential at least a while longer."
</P>
<P>
Libyan lawyers and the U.N. legal team, which spent several
weeks in New York, have discussed the matters on the surrender of
the two suspects in the Lockerbie bombing, which took place nearly
10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Libya has agreed to put the two suspects, namely Abdel Basset
Ali Mohammed al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah, on trial in the
Netherlands before a Scottish court. But Tripoli has objected to
British and U.S. demands that they serve their sentences in
Scotland if convicted.
</P>
<P>
The two Libyans have been accused by the United States and
Britain of planting a bomb aboard Pan Am Flight 303 which
exploded over the Scottish village of Lockerbie in December
1988, killing 270 people.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Commerce Secretary Calls for Improved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Commerce Secretary
William Daley ended a one-day visit here Thursday with strong
call for improved trade and investment environment in Africa
which will expand U.S.-African economic relationship.
</P>
<P>
"Your economic house must be in order. Companies look at the
fundamentals of government policies... and I encourage all of you
to help promote a more transparent, open, better environment for
doing business," he told economic leaders from Uganda, Tanzania
and Kenya at a luncheon here.
</P>
<P>
He urged the continent to make more efforts to "build on the
progress to date in privatizing and cutting trade barriers," to
maintain political stability, improve infrastructure and legal
structure, as well as promote regional trade.
</P>
<P>
"For Africa to be on a global stage, it cannot be small
disconnected markets. It must be regional markets... But today,
only 13 percent of African trade is with other African
countries," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Later at a press conference, he said that he is optismistic
about the prospect of the two-way trade between Africa and
America especially as the Clinton administration may push the
African Growth and Opportunity Act through Congress next year.
</P>
<P>
"I am optimistic that the African Growth and Opportunity Act
will go through, and I believe... that it will go through next
year," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The bill to promote trade and investment in Africa was passed
by the U.N. House of Representatives in March, but got stalled
before the Senate Finance Committee in July after a series of
amendments were attached to it.
</P>
<P>
Daley's visit, the second to Kenya and the third to Africa
this year, is widely seen as a clear signal that the U.S. is
trying hard to re-focus its relationship with the poorest
continent from politics to economy.
</P>
<P>
Daley, who flies to Cote d'Ivoire on Thursday evening, was
accompanied by a 15-strong delegation of American corporate
executives including those from AT&AMP;T, Chevron, Dupont, Cargill,
Kodak and Pfizer.
</P>
<P>
Four commercial cooperation agreements were signed Thursday
between the U.S. companies and the Kenyan side on agricultural
research, investment fund, industrial standard and aviation.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Export-Import Bank signed an accord on financing
Kenya Airways Ltd. to purchase a Boeing 737-300 aircraft from
America.
</P>
<P>
Data from the Kenyan Trade Ministry show that in 1997, Kenya
imported 705.49 million Shillings (around 102 million U.S.
Dollars) of U.S. goods and and exported goods worth of 170.07
million Shillings (some 28.3 million Dollars) to the United
States.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia to Exert Efforts to Boost Coffee Income </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia's Coffee and Tea
Authority said Thursday that it is exerting maximum efforts to
boost the revenue from coffee export.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ethiopian News Agency, Tsegaye Berhane,
General Manager of the authority, told journalists that a slump
in the world coffee price is feared in 1998/99 as a result of
high production of the crop in coffee producing countries like
Brazil.
</P>
<P>
Tsegaye said that a slump in the world price of coffee could
have a domino effect on the price of Ethiopia coffee in the
international auction.
</P>
<P>
Coffee is Ethiopia's most important export commodity and
contributes to about 60 percent of the export income.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopian Minister of Trade and Industry Kasahun Ayele
announced here last month that the income from coffee export
takes a 63.6 percent share of its export planned in 1998/99 (July
8, 1998-July 7, 1999).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tsegaye urged the coffee producers and traders not
to keep the crop in storage for an extended period of time.
</P>
<P>
A sizable quantity of coffee is kept in storage by Ethiopian
farmers and traders, according to the authority.
</P>
<P>
"If coffee is stored for a long time, it will lose its quality
and taste," the general manager said, adding that "this will, in
turn, have a dire consequence on the value of Ethiopian coffee in
the world market."

<HEADLINE> Tanzania's Trade Account Improves: C. Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's trade account
during October improved by 33 percent, reducing deficit by 26.5
million U.S. Dollars over the previous month, the Bank of
Tanzania said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
This improvement was largely due to an increase in export
earnings by 67.2 percent, which more than offset the effect of
1.9 percent increase in import bill, the central bank said in its
latest monthly economic review.
</P>
<P>
The increase in export earnings originated from the
traditional sector whose earnings more than doubled, said the
November issue report.
</P>
<P>
During the year ending October 1998, the trade account
recorded a deficit of 788.3 million Dollars, representing a 28.5
percent increase compared with a deficit of 613.6 million Dollars
recorded during the corresponding period last year, it added.
</P>
<P>
The trade account deficit worsened during the reviewing period
primarily because of a significant decline in export earnings
coupled with an increase of the import bill, it said.

LONDON, December 3 (Xinhua) - The London International
Financial Futures and Options Exchange (LIFFE) traded 11,980,834
futures and options contracts during November 1998.
</P>
<P>
Average daily volume amounted to 570,516 contracts,
representing an average daily nominal turnover of 182 billion
pounds (291.2 billion US dollars), the LIFFE announced here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
During the year to date, January to the end of November,
LIFFE's cumulative volume totalled 184,423,442 contracts, 6
percent down on the same period last year, it added.
</P>
<P>
Open interest, a good indicator of liquidity and long term use
of the market, totalled 9,044,135 contracts on 30 november, an
increase of 22 percent from the same time last year.
</P>
<P>
Hugh Freedberg, LIFFE's Chief Executive, said "LIFFE's November
volumes reflected quiet underlying cash markets due to lower
volatility, ahead of the introduction of Economic and Mometary
Union."
</P>
<P>
However, with the introduction of a Three Month Euro Euribor
futures contract on 8 December, LIFFE will be offering the market
a complete range of euro-denominated money market contracts in the
run-up to EMU and beyond, Freedberg added.

<HEADLINE> Retail Confidence Falls in Britain at Record Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 3 (Xinhua) - Confidence in high street sales
among British retailers is falling at its fastest rate since
records began 15 years ago, according to a survey by The
Confederation of British Industry (CBI).
</P>
<P>
Sales volumes were down, with only 36 percent of shops
reporting an increase compared with the same time last year and 45
percent experiencing a dip.
</P>
<P>
The CBI found that falling sales in November took retailers by
surprise and led them drastically to cut their expectations.
</P>
<P>
It said the survey underlined the need for a further cut in
interest rates at the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee
meeting next week.
</P>
<P>
Sudhir Junankar, the CBI's associate director of economic
analysis, said the results "underlined the message from other
data, that demand at home is softening, supporting the need for a
0.5 percent cut in interest rates next week."
</P>
<P>
The survey came on the day that another poll found the service
sector as a whole had contracted for the first time in at least
two years.
</P>
<P>
The November Chartered Institute of Purchasing Managers' report
found business activity decreased for the first time since the
survey began in July 1996.

<HEADLINE> Britain Denies Paying for Charges against Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The British embassy in Cairo on
Thursday denied that it was channeling money to an Egyptian human
rights group for a report on alleged religious persecution in the
country.
</P>
<P>
An embassy spokesman said the claim that the money sent to the
Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) was payment for its
report on Egyptian police torture of Christian Copts in the south
was wrong.
</P>
<P>
That the embassy relaying a check of 25,703 U.S. dollars
offered by the British Foreign Office to EOHR "has nothing to do
with" that report, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
According to Egypt's Middle East News Agency, the spokesman
said that Britain has contributed to EOHR during the past two
years, including the latest sum, and the funds were intended to
help finance an EOHR program to provide legal aid for Egyptian
women.
</P>
<P>
The British embassy's denial came after the Al Usbou weekly
newspaper maintained that the check that EOHR recently received
from the embassy was behind its report.
</P>
<P>
The private-owned weekly denounced EOHR's acceptance of the
money as treason, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
EOHR, founded in 1985, decided a week ago to send back the
check to the British embassy.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Gazette newspaper has reported that EOHR released
a report in September claiming that more than 1,000 Copts were
rounded up by police at Kosheh village in southern Suhag
Governorate.
</P>
<P>
Based on the allegation, Britain's Sunday Telegraph newspaper
said: "Egyptian Christians have been subjected to horrific
crucification rituals, raped and tortured by the security forces
during a crackdown on the ancient Coptic community."
</P>
<P>
Egypt's parliament, social groups and celebrities have
denounced the story in the British newspaper as a fabrication
aimed at defaming Egypt.
</P>
<P>
They said Muslim majority and Christian minority have been
peacefully co-existing for more than 14 centuries.

MOGADISHU, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of Somalis with
green leaves, placards, flags, guns and battle wagons Thursday
headed toward the dusty airstrips of Jasira and Km-50 to receive

support for the administration he created with his former arch
rival Ali Mahdi Mohamed in early August this year.
</P>
<P>
Hussein Aidid has visited Addis Ababa of Ethiopia, Yemen,
Egypt and Libya where he met the leaders of the countries over
the possible ways they could assist the administration of
Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
More than 800,000 U.S. Dollars in cash, medicines and police
uniforms have already reached the capital in his absence as the
first signs of moral support from those countries.
</P>
<P>
Despite all these donations and the demobilization of three
thousand militiamen, the security situation in Mogadishu still
remains far from stable.
</P>
<P>
Likewise, faction leader Osman Ali Atto has landed from the
dusty and narrow airstrip of Jasira, 7 km south of the capital.
</P>
<P>
Osman Ali Atto left Mogadishu a few days after the
establishment of Mogadishu's administration which he rejected its
legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
Osman Atto, together with other political opponents of
Mogadishu's administration, have been lobbying for blocking any
political recognition or material support for Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
The arrival of the two warlords in Mogadishu Thursday is not a
mere coincidence, but a tactful act in which both men are
preparing to meet the international delegation currently visiting
Somalia for the assessment of a possible reconciliation and
reconstruction for Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The delegation which is due to arrive in Mogadishu in two
or three days is not likely to be smooth going in their attempts
to meet the political rivals, business rivals, religious rivals,
rival traditional elders as well as rival Islamic courts.
</P>
<P>
The forthcoming delegation has already affected Mogadishu
where the value of international currencies are decreasing
considerably.
</P>
<P>
The administration of Somaliland has already met the
delegation while others like Puntland, Mogadishu and Hiran are on
the schedule to meet them, with political rivals also looking
forward to the meeting with the aim of telling them their own
views and efforts in reconciling and rebuilding a better Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Politicians foresee that those groups will in the end manage
to confuse the delegation, since each group is pretending to be
the largest and most significant, and a solution for Somalia's
crises will remain as difficult as ever unless a strong decision
is taken by the international community toward the formation of a
central administration for Somalia if it will ever come into
existence in the near future.

<HEADLINE> U.N. General Assembly Asked to Debate Cyprus Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus has officially informed
the United Nations that it would request a debate on the Cyprus
issue at the General Assembly in 1999, government spokesman
Christos Stylianides said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus' permanent representative to the U.N., Sotos Zackheos,
has told General Assembly President Didier Opertti on Wednesday of
the decision, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made by Cyprus's National Council, the top
advisory body to the president, he added.
</P>
<P>
U.N. secretary-general's envoy in Cyprus, Ann Hercus, began
separate meetings with Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots in
October to ease the tensions on the island, Stylianides said.
</P>
<P>
The protracted Cyprus problem was frequently discussed by the
U.N. Security Council, but has not been the subject of a General
Assembly debate since 1983.
</P>
<P>
Peace efforts have come to a standstill since the summer of
1997, when Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash demanded
international recognition of his breakaway state in northern
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
He also demanded that Cyprus withdraw its application to join
the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated
south and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since Turkey landed
its troops and took over the northern third of the island in 1974
following a failed pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots declared unilaterally in 1983 a "Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus," which was recognized only by
Turkey.

<P>
LAGOS, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Liberian President Charles
Taylor has proposed a balanced 1999 budget to parliament,
with spending up by 55 percent over 1998, a report reaching here
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The draft budget, proposed to the Liberian parliament Wednesday,
projected spending of 2.6 billion Liberian Dollars, or 64 million
U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Taylor said the government would cover spending from revenue
without foreign help. "This shows that we have improved a little
bit over our revenue collection," he said.
</P>
<P>
He proposed the creation of a budget allotment committee to
ensure the funds are used for what they are intended.
</P>
<P>
Taylor said there would be no tax increase but efforts would
be made to improve the collection of existing taxes.
</P>
<P>
He also announced the cuts in official visits abroad and in
the number of Liberian embassies.
</P>
<P>
The embassy in South Africa will be responsible for southern
Africa, while Europe will be covered by an ambassador to the
European Union, the report added.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan President Calls for End to Circumcision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni has urged Sabiny people in eastern districts to change
the culture of circumcising women and to appreciate that the
practice is dangerous medically and creates numerous health
problems for women.
</P>
<P>
A press release from the President's Office said Museveni made
the appeal Thursday when addressing a public rally during his
one-day visit to the Kapchorwa district which coincided with the
celebrations to mark the district's Culture Day.
</P>
<P>
Culture, like all living things, has to grow and change if it
is to remain healthy and that his government has approached the
issue of women circumcision through education, sensitization and
dialog rather than legislation, he said.
</P>
<P>
He thanked Sabiny elders and organizations such as the United
Nations Fund for Population Activities for helping the government
in the campaign against female circumcision.
</P>
<P>
Female circumcision in the Sabiny tribe, which has been
observed for centuries, is considered by local people as a sign
of reaching womanhood. The fight against this old tradition won
a U.N. prize for the Sabiny leader recently.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Export Earnings Rise by 67.1 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's total export
earnings during October increased by 67.1 percent to 71.9 million
U.S. Dollars, compared with 43 million U.S. Dollars recorded
during the previous month, the central bank said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A monthly economic review report by the Bank of Tanzania (BoT)
largely attributed the rise to a significant increase in earnings
from traditional exports.
</P>
<P>
Earnings from traditional exports increased by 184.2 percent
to 42 million Dollars in October, compared with 14.8 million
Dollars recorded in the previous month, the November issue report
said.
</P>
<P>
Increases in both prices and volumes explain the improvement,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
Except for cotton and sisal, whose volumes declined by 13.3
percent and 21.4 percent respectively, all other traditional
exports, namely coffee, tea, tobacco and cashewnut recorded
significant increases in export volumes, the report said, adding
that all crops recorded unit price increases during the period
under review.
</P>
<P>
In the same period, it said, earnings from non-traditional
exports increased by 5.9 percent to 29.9 million U.S. Dollars
from 28.3 million U.S. Dollars in the previous month.
</P>
<P>
There was an increase in export earnings from petroleum
products, manufactured tobacco, fish and fish products,
horticultural produce and other exports, while all other
non-traditional exports, namely minerals, manufactured goods,
cotton yarn, manufactured coffee and sisal products recorded
declines in export earnings.
</P>
<P>
However, earnings from traditional exports decreased to 329.6
million U.S. Dollars, from 377.6 million recorded during the same
period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the country's total imports in October increased by
two percent to 125.7 million U.S. Dollars, from 123.3 million
U.S. Dollars recorded during the previous month.

<HEADLINE> Canada Seeks Consultations on European Union </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Canadian International Trade
Minister Sergio Marchi announced Thursday that Canada has
requested World Trade Organization (WTO) consultations on European
Union(EU) patent measures on pharmaceutical and agricultural
chemical products.
</P>
<P>
The measures at issue relate to the EU supplementary protection
certificate (SPC), which extends patent protection beyond the
minimum 20 years as required in the Agreement on Trade-related
Aspects of Intelectual Property Rights(TRIPS).
</P>
<P>
Canada argues that the SPC is discriminatory and contrary to
the EU's WTO obligations, since it applies only to pharmaceutical
and agricultural chemical products.
</P>
<P>
"Canada has no objection to other countries offering greater
protection than the minimum required by the TRIPS Agreement," said
Minister Marchi in a release. "However, the discriminatory nature
of the EU regime contravenes its WTO obligations."
</P>
<P>
The international trade system allows a balance between the
interests of innovator companies in having a healthy and
profitable investment climate and the global objective of ensuring
that low-cost medicines are available as soon as possible after
patent expiry, said the release.

WASHINGTON, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The United States said
Thursday that U.S. and Cuban officials will meet Friday in Havana
for another in a series of discussions on migration issues.
</P>
<P>
The talks are aimed at ensuring continued smooth operation of
migration agreements between the two countries, said State
Department spokesman James Foley.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the talks, the 10th in the current
series, will deal exclusively with migration issues. The U.S.
delegation will be led by John Hamilton, a deputy assistant
secretary
</P>
<P>
Since 1995, the U.S. Coast Guard has been returning to the
island Cuban boat people who attempt to flee to the United States.
Cuba has promised not to punish those who are returned.
</P>
<P>
A recurring U.S. complaint is that the departure fees Cuba
charges to legal emigrants are excessive. A bilateral agreement
requires the United States to grant residence visas to 20,000
Cubans each year.
</P>
<P>
Another U.S. concern is Cuba's unwillingness to allow the
return of some of the Cubans who arrived in the United States in
the 1980 Mariel boat-lift.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Hopes Annan Can Help Solve Lockerbie Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Egypt hoped that U.N. Secretary
General Kofi Annan's upcoming visit to Libya would help seek a
solution to the Lockerbie issue.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said all parties concerned
have the desire to end the standoff between Libya, on the one
hand, and the United States and Britain, on the other, Egypt's
Middle East News Agency reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said Egypt hopes that the problem could be settled to
the satisfaction of both sides.
</P>
<P>
Annan is scheduled to arrive in Tripoli, capital of Libya on
Saturday to help solve the Lockerbie issue in which 270 people
were killed..
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain demanded that Libya surrender two of its
citizens suspected of blowing up the Pan Am 103 flight over
Lockerbie, Scotland in 1988.
</P>
<P>
For years, Washington and London insisted that the two suspects
be tried either in the U.S. or Scotland. Fearing that its citizens
will not get a fair trial, Libya refused to hand over the
suspects, demanding that they be tried in a neutral country.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain succeeded in pressing the U.N. Security
Council to impose an air and arms embargo on Libya in 1992 for its
refusal to extradite the suspects.
</P>
<P>
A compromise has been reached lately that the Libyan suspects
be tried in the Hague, the Netherlands by Scottish judges
according to Scottish law.
</P>
<P>
Libya, meanwhile, seeks guarantee that the suspects will not be
extradited to the U.S. and wants them to be imprisoned in Libya if
convicted of guilty.

<HEADLINE> Holocaust Conference Adopts Guidelines for Nazi Art </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 3 (Xinhua) -- An international conference
agreed Thursday that arts confiscated from Jews by Nazi Germany,
including Picassos and Cezannes, could be returned to prewar
owners or their heirs or auctioned to benefit Holocaust survivors.
</P>
<P>
However, the guidelines, endorsed Thursday by 44 countries at
the International Holocaust-era Assets here, aren't legally
binding on countries. The four-day conference ended Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The art world will never be the same in the way it deals with
Nazi-confiscated art," said Stuart Eizenstat, undersecretary of
state and head of the U.S. delegation sponsoring the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"From now on, the sale, purchase, exchange and display of art
from this period will be addressed with greater sensitivity and a
higher international standard of responsibility," he said.
</P>
<P>
The guidelines "represent a moral commitment among nations
which all in the art world will have to take into account," said
Eizenstat.
</P>
<P>
In their final session, delegates from country after country,
including France, Austria, Germany, the Netherlands and Denmark,
announced agreement with U.S.-drafted principles to investigate
the wartime heritage of art collections around the world to
determine if any works were looted.
</P>
<P>
The guidelines suggest the return to heirs or owners or
possible restitution.
</P>
<P>
Delegates, by consensus approval, also endorsed returning
communal property such as former synagogues, schools, community
centers and cemeteries to the care of Jewish groups in Eastern and
Central Europe after decades of being in the hands of the Nazis or
communist governments.
</P>
<P>
Outstanding life insurance claims from as many as 800,000
Jewish families would also be paid off within two years, if
possible, by an international commission formed earlier this year,
under another key conference principle.
</P>
<P>
Eizenstat said he was "impressed... almost overwhelmed" by what
the conference had accomplished in four days in working to set
informal standards on dealing with art and communal property that
remains unclaimed or outside Jewish control so many years after
World War II.
</P>
<P>
But many obstacles still remain in returning what the World
Jewish Congress estimates is about 110,000 pieces of "missing art"
from the Holocaust that is considered looted and of unclear
origin.
</P>
<P>
The estimated value of the artworks is 10 billion to 30 billion
U.S. dollars, according to the Jewish Congress.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Press Urged Not to Publish Unresearched </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 3 (Xinhua) --The Ugandan Presidential Office
has urged the press here not to publish unresearched stories
because they often mislead the public.
</P>
<P>
The office made the call in response to two what it considers
ungrounded stories carried in the Monitor daily dated November 24
and the Crusader newspaper dated December 3.
</P>
<P>
In a press release issued Thursday, Presidential Press
Secretary Hope Kivengere said the presidential office is gravely
concerned about the increasing tendency by the press to write
wild, unresearched stories.
</P>
<P>
The Monitor report said President Yoweri Museveni shocked his
security team by unexpectedly changing his flight to Rwakitura
and flew to Rwanda to hold talks with Rwandese Vice-President
Paul Kagame.
</P>
<P>
The press release said the story is ungrounded because the
president went to his home that weekend and did not go out of the
country.
</P>
<P>
The Crusador report alleged that Museveni returned home from
the recently ended Franco-Africa summit in Paris by taking a
South African Airforce plane because his presidential jet was
targeted by his enemies.
</P>
<P>
Hope said the president used a South African plane both to and
from Paris because his jet was out of the country on its normal
regular service.
</P>
<P>
She said the two papers should have contacted the President's
Office to get correct information to avoid publishing wild
allegations and called for all media to avoid sensational,
unresearched stories.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD) said Thursday that it is
necessary to establish rules for international investment.
</P>
<P>
But senior OECD officials failed to agree at an informal
meeting Thursday in Paris to resume talks on a Multilateral
Agreement on Investment (MAI), which went into a deadlock last
December because of a boycott by France.
</P>
<P>
France wishes to protect the domestic cultural market from an
overwhelming influence from the United States by imposing
restrictions on investment by U.S. audio and video products
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
The OECD said in a communique that its 29 member countries have
agreed to work on the rules for investment which will be first
applied within its member countries.
</P>
<P>
"There exist in fact a certain number of important issues which
need new analysis and inter-governmental cooperation," said the
communique.
</P>
<P>
Some hope that the talks on MAI should be transferred to the
World Trade Organization, but the proposal has met with opposition
from some developing countries which are against imposition of
international rules on investment.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Decides to Extend MONUA's Mandate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council Thursday decided to extend the mandate of the United
Nations Observer Mission in Angola (MONUA) until February 26,
1999.
</P>
<P>
The decision came in a resolution adopted unanimously by the
15-member Security Council after it considered a report on the
current situation in Angola by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
The resolution demanded that the rebel UNITA "comply
immediately and without conditions with its obligations, in
particular the complete demilitarization of its forces and full
cooperation in the immediate and unconditional extension of state
administration throughout the national territory."
</P>
<P>
The resolution called on the leadership of UNITA to "cooperate
fully and immediately" with the MONUA in the withdrawal of the
U.N. mission personnel from the conflict-hit areas of Andulo and
Bailundo, and held the leadership of the rebel group "responsible
for their safety and security."
</P>
<P>
The Security Council said in the resolution that "the primary
cause of the crisis in Angola and of the current impasse in the
peace process is the failure by the leadership of UNITA in
Bailundo to comply with its obligations" under the peace accords
and relevant U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The resolution was sponsored by Portugal, Russia and the United
States, the three countries which are in a group to monitor the
peace process in Angola.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that the Angolan government has agreed to
the extension of the mandate of the MONUA until February next
year.
</P>
<P>
In his report to the Security Council last week, Annan said
that "the overall political, military and security situation in
the country has further deteriorated. The dialogue between the
government and (Jonas) Savimbi and his movement has ceased."
</P>
<P>
The MONUA was sent into Angola under a Security Council
resolution on June 30, 1997 to monitor the peace process in the
African country.

<HEADLINE> EU Increases Trade Ties with Asian Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brussels, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The 15 European Union (EU)
countries have increased more imports from 11 Asian countries and
areas. EU's trade deficit with the Asia region rose last year to
31 billion ECU (some 34 billion U.S. dollars) from 16.2 billion
ECU (17.8 U.S. dollars) in 1996, according to EU's statistics
available here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The 11 Asian countries and areas are China, Japan, South Korea,
Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Brunei
and Vietnam, as well as China' Hong Kong. They have been denoted
as Asia 11 since they participated in the Asia-Europe Meeting
(ASEM) in London in April this year, the statistics report said.
</P>
<P>
The 15 European countries' imports of goods from the Asia 11
amounted to 168.3 billion ECU (185.1 billion U.S.dollars) in 1997
while their exports to the Asia 11 region totalled 132.8 billion
ECU (146 billion U.S. dollars). The report showed the
corresponding figures for 1996 were 139.3 billion ECU (153.2
billion U.S. dollars) and 123.1 billion ECU (135.4 billion
U.S.dollars).
</P>
<P>
The report said the negative balance overall last year comes
mainly from that of the Britain (-15.3 billion ECU) and the
Netherlands (-13.9 billion ECU), while small positive balances
recorded by some other EU member states were not enough to
compensate.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the EU deficit resulted from large negative balances
with Japan (-23.3 billion ECU) and China (-20.09 billion ECU). But
the large deficit was offset by a positive balance of 12.1 billion
ECU with Hong Kong, the report shows.
</P>
<P>
During last year, both EU's imports and exports from and to the
Asian 11 region were concentrated in machinery and transport
equipment, which accounted for over half of all trade. These
products, together with miscellaneous manufactures, were
responsible for the EU being over 30 billion ECU (33 billion
U.S.dollars) in the red, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The statistics also showed that imports to the EU from Asia 11
came mainly from Japan (36.2 percent), ASEAN (28 percent) and
China (22.8 percent), which represent 17.6 percent up from 1996 to
1997, higher than the rise of 14.9 percent in extra-EU imports in
general.
</P>
<P>
This "implies an increasing share of Asia 11 in extra-EU
imports", the report said.

<HEADLINE> Egypt's Human Rights Group Stops Activities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The Egyptian Organization for
Human Rights (EOHR) Thursday announced to freeze its activities in
Egypt.
</P>
<P>
In a board meeting, the organization's general assembly was
asked to meet within three months to review the decision.
</P>
<P>
The board denied once again any link between a check of 25,703
U.S. dollars EOHR received from the British embassy in Cairo and
its report on what it called religious prosecution in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
EOHR insisted that it has not conducted any activities that
might subject itself or any members to legal procedures.
</P>
<P>
EOHR's decision followed the detention of its secretary
general, Hafez Abu Saada, Wednesday, accused of "receiving foreign
funds with the intention of damaging national interests."
</P>
<P>
The private-owned Al Usbou weekly newspaper reported that EOHR
got the check from the British embassy after it released the
report alleging police torture of Christian Copts in southern
Egypt. The weekly described the report as treason.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper testified on October 25 to the Egyptian public
prosecution by showing a copy of the check and a copy of the
organization's report.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's higher State Security Court issued the detention
warrant Wednesday after questioning Abu Saada over the issue. He
would face seven to 15 years of hard labor if convicted, judicial
sources said.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Gazette newspaper reported on Tuesday that EOHR in
its September report said that more than 1,000 Copts were rounded
up by security forces in Kosheh village in southern Suhag
Governorate.
</P>
<P>
Based on the allegation, Britain's Sunday Telegraph newspaper
reported that "Egyptian Christians have been subjected to horrific
crucification rituals, raped and tortured by the security forces
during a crackdown on the ancient Coptic community."
</P>
<P>
Egypt's parliament, social groups and celebrities have

<HEADLINE> Algeria to Intensify Consultations on Oil Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Algeria would intensify
consultations with other members of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) on ways to raise oil prices.
</P>
<P>
Algerian Minister of Energy and Mines Youcef Yousfi, who is
current chief of the OPEC, made the remark Thursday in a press
briefing on the fringe of an international conference on gas now
in session here, the Algerian News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The current price slump is very serious for the oil producing
countries, which lost some 80 billion U.S. dollars this year, he
said. Algeria alone incurred a loss somewhere between 2.5 and 3
billion, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The main factors of the crisis, he said, are the heated
speculations after the OPEC meeting in Vienna on November 26
failed to agree upon new cuts in oil production and the weak
demand on the oil market this winter.
</P>
<P>
The majority of the OPEC members were in favor of production
cuts to curb the imbalance of the oil market, but differences on
the production cut quotas blocked any new resolutions during the
meeting, Yousfi said.

<HEADLINE> Egypt's Trade Deficit Rises in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's trade deficit in the
first eight months of 1998 was 28.22 billion Egyptian pounds (8.3
billion U.S. dollars), a 37.39 percent rise from the same period
last year.
</P>
<P>
A monthly report issued Thursday by the Cabinet Information and
Decision Support Center attributed the increase of the deficit to
the fall in export and rise in import, the Middle East News Agency
said.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Egypt exported 6.87 billion pounds (2.02
billion dollars) worth of goods in the January-August period, down
about 21 percent from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The imports, on the other hand, rose about 20 percent from a
year earlier to reach 35.09 billion pounds (10.32 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Manufactured and semi-manufactured exports in the period stood
at 3.85 billion pounds (1.13 billion dollars), compared to 4.02
billion pounds (1.18 billion dollars) of the same 1997 period.
</P>
<P>
Exports of raw materials and cotton was 845 million pounds
(248.5 million dollars), compared to 806 million pounds (237.1
million dollars) in the first eight months in 1997.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Appeals for Emergency Aid to Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 3 (Xinhua) -- United Nations agencies
Thursday issued a consolidated appeal for 28 million U.S. dollars
to respond to the humanitarian need of more than 310,000
internally displaced people and to support needs of 450,000
refugees uprooted by the conflict in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The lingering conflict and the terror exacted on the civilian
population by remnants of the rebel junta continue to have a
devastating impact on the abuses including mutilation, sexual
exploitation and forced recruitment of child soldiers by rebels.
</P>
<P>
With the political and military support of the international
community, most notably by the Economic Community of West African
States (ECOWAS), and assistance provided by the United Nations,
"the prospects for an end to the protracted conflict may yet be in
sight," said the U.N. agencies.
</P>
<P>
The determination and commitment of the majority to rid the
country of the undemocratic and barbarian elements acting within
Sierra Leone underscore the resolve for lasting peace and
recovery, the agencies said.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations, in cooperation with the Government of
Sierra Leone, donors, international organizations and a consortium
of non-governmental organizations, has set out a coordinated
strategy of humanitarian assistance.
</P>
<P>
The program includes a strong emphasis on the promotion of
human rights as a means of addressing the root causes of the
conflict, the agencies said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Has More Than 1.2 Million Abortions in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The United States had more
than 1.2 million abortions in 1996, or 20 abortions per 1,000
women aged 15 to 44, the government reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said there were
1,221,585 abortions in 1996, an increase of less than 1 percent
from the previous year. It was the first time abortions have not
declined since 1990, when the total was more than 1.4 million.
</P>
<P>
The nation legalized abortions nationally in 1973. Since then,
abortion rates had increased steadily until 1980, when they
reached 25 per 1,000 women aged 15 to 44. But they leveled off
through 1992, when rates began falling again.
</P>
<P>
The Associated Press quoted the Centers as saying that the
decline may have been caused by a drop in unwanted pregnancies.
Abortion rights supporters have said there are also fewer clinics
performing abortions.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Productivity Increases 3 Pct in Third Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The productivity of American
workers grew at a healthy 3 percent annual rate in the third
quarter over the previous quarter in the Summer, the Labor
Department said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The increase in the productivity of nonfarm, nonsupervisory
workers in the July-September quarter, measured as output per hour
of work, was even better than the 2.3 percent seasonally adjusted
rate reported in an initial estimate last month.
</P>
<P>
After growing at a brisk 2.9 percent annual rate in the 1960s
and early 1970s, productivity slowed to a 1 percent a year from
1974 through 1995. Since then, it's been growing at about a 2
percent rate.
</P>
<P>
Some economists believed that the U.S. economy has embarked on
a new era of productivity growth, driven by computers and other
high-tech innovations.
</P>
<P>
In the third quarter, hours worked rose a slight 1.2 percent at
nonfarm businesses. Compensation per hour rose at a strong 4.1
percent rate. But output increased at an even more robust 4.2
percent rate. That meant that unit labor costs, a key measure of
underlying inflation pressure, rose at a tame 1.1 percent annual
rate.
</P>
<P>
At factories, productivity increased at a 5.2 percent rate.
Output was up only slightly, at a 0.7 percent rate, but hours
worked plummeted at a 4.3 percent rate.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the level of jobless claims reported for last week
was still below the level of early November. However, a four-week
moving average rose by 250 to a seasonally adjusted 319,250.

<HEADLINE> Livingston Wants Impeachment Inquiry Completed This Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Incoming Speaker Bob
Livingston made clear Thursday he wants the U.S. House of
Representatives to vote on impeachment by year's end.
</P>
<P>
"I can't say I'd be perfectly happy" if the fight extends into
the new year, Livingston said during a news conference with Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott. He said that could happen only if
impeachment investigators didn't wrap up work by next week.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, White House lawyers are preparing a "vigorous
defense" of Clinton and demanding sensitive fund-raising memos and
other material gathered by Republican investigators.
</P>
<P>
Livingston said it is too early to make any decision on whether
the House should consider censuring Clinton as an alternative to
impeachment -- an option that has some support in both parties.
"I'm just not going to make a decision on that," he said.
</P>
<P>
Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde told Republican members
in a conference call Thursday morning that the staff review of
Justice Department memos detailing alleged fund-raising
irregularities in Clinton's campaign in 1996 did not yield
information worth considering for articles of impeachment, several
committee officials said.
</P>
<P>
"The evidence from the Department of Justice being examined in
relation to possible campaign finance violations will not be a
part of the inquiry next week," Representative Asa Hutchinson, a
Republican, said through his spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Representative Peter King, a Republican, was circulating a
censure proposal Thursday. It would include a strong condemnation
of Clinton and require him to pay a financial penalty and issue a
statement acknowledging wrongdoing, according to King's spokesman,
Kevin Fogarty.
</P>
<P>
Livingston told reporters he had discussed impeachment briefly
in meetings this week with House Majority Leader Dick Armey and
Majority Whip Tom DeLay.
</P>
<P>
The White House legal team accepted an invitation from the
Judiciary Committee Wednesday to make a defense before the inquiry
next Tuesday and possibly even call witnesses, but demanded access
to the fund-raising memos and additional investigative material
related to Monica Lewinsky and Kathleen Willey.
</P>
<P>
The Judiciary Committee is preparing for four days of hearings
next week, beginning with the White House defense and ending with
possible votes on at least one article of impeachment. If such a
proposal passes, the full House is likely to vote the following
week.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's New Coach Shares His Vision for Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 4 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's newly
appointed national soccer coach Trott Moloto has indicated that
the winds of change would soon blow through the entire national
coaching set-up, with more emphasis on youth.
</P>
<P>
Moloto also pledged to improve the quality of national team's
strikers, saying the inability of the strikers to perform
adequately at international level is cause for concern, The
Citizen paper reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Moloto, who has been care-taker coach of the national side
since the end of this year's World Cup, was appointed on Thursday
as national head coach until March 2000, beyond the African
Nations Cup finals in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
"My priority is to make sure Bafana (the national side)
qualify for the African Nations Cup finals in 2000," he said.
South Africans lost to Egyptians in the African Nations Cup final
in February this year.
</P>
<P>
"But of equal importance is to develop and expand SAFA (South
African Football Association)'s youth policy from under-13 right
to the top. The youth are our future and we have to encourage
them."
</P>
<P>
Moloto, who was once national under-17 coach, said he aims to
have a fine blend of youth and experience in the side.
</P>
<P>
Moloto said he will not tolerate breaches of discipline such
as were seen in the World Cup finals in France, and the only
criteria for selection will be current form.
</P>
<P>
"Reputations and past successes will count for nothing... I
will bring a new spirit to the team. I want the players to look
to me as a father figure to trust and respect," he said.
</P>
<P>
Moloto is expected to show his hand in this regard when he
names an 18-man squad on Monday, which will play Egypt in the
Nelson Mandela Challenge in Johannesburg on December 16.
</P>
<P>
In another step to avoid a repeat of the problems which
bedevilled the national team in recent years, Moloto disclosed
that he plans to have national B-team on stand-by, which is made
up purely of locally-based players.
</P>
<P>
This is to ensure if the overseas-based players are not being
released by their clubs for national duty, he will not be left in
a lurch.
</P>
<P>
Moloto, who will announce his new technical staff on January
1, will not be looking overseas for help.
</P>
<P>
"I don't see the need. We have good coaches in South Africa
who I can turn to for assistance," he said.
</P>
<P>
Moloto started his coaching career in 1985 as assistant coach
at a local premier league club. He had been assistant to the two
previous national coaches since early this year.

<HEADLINE> UK Government Condemns Violence in Northern Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The British Government on Friday
condemned the violence between loyalist Orangemen and police
officers at Drumcree in Northern Ireland on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
The Security Minister Adam Ingram said the incident was "a
throwback to behavior that the great majority of people in
Northern Ireland want an end to."
</P>
<P>
"The issues surrounding Drumcree cannot be resolved by riot and
violence," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ingram added the only way forward was through dialogue and by
reaching an agreed accommodation at local level, he said. The
government was doing everything it could to achieve that outcome.
</P>
<P>
The trouble flared near Drumcree Church among a 1,000-strong
crowd demonstrating in support of Orangemen involved in the
stand-off with police. The Orangemen insisted on walking down the
flashpoint nationalist Garvaghy Road before Christmas.
</P>
<P>
During the clashes loyalist rioters attacked police with
bricks, wooden stakes and fireworks.
</P>
<P>
A police officer fired a plastic baton round to try to scatter
rioters throwing missiles.
</P>
<P>
Four protesters were treated in hospital. They included a
20-year-old woman who suffered a broken wrist and a 72-year-old
man who was hit in the eye.
</P>
<P>
Ten police officers were hurt but none of them seriously and
there were no arrests.
</P>
<P>
The Drumcree protesters said they were more determined than
ever to hold their banned traditional parade and would stay put
during Christmas Day if necessary.

BEIJING, December 4 (Xinhua) -- China hopes to advance the
existing friendship between the Chinese National People's Congress
(NPC) and the parliament of Morocco, said top-legislator Li
Peng.
</P>
<P>
Li, chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, made this remark
during a meeting today with visiting Moroccan prime minister
Abderrahmane Youssoufi.
</P>
<P>
Youssoufi recalled his meeting with Li when he paid an
official visit to Morocco in 1995, and said that he was glad to
meet Li again.
</P>
<P>
Li expressed his gratitude to the Moroccan government and
people for their hospitality. He noted that China and Morocco
have witnessed the sound development of bilateral relations since
forging bilateral diplomatic ties, and as developing countries
there are no conflicts of interest between them, but rather
cooperation, understanding and friendship.
</P>
<P>
Li briefed the visitors on China's NPC system and invited
leaders of the Moroccan parliament to visit China.
</P>

<P>
In addition, the two sides exchanged views on the inauguration
of the euro currency and the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Youssoufi said that the integrity of European Union currencies
will benefit the EU nations and help stablize the financial
situation worldwide. However, he pointed out, small countries like
Morocco will encounter difficulties due to their increased debts
to European creditors.
</P>
<P>
Morocco has also been affected by the Asian financial crisis,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Li admitted that China was under great pressure and had to meet
difficulties because of the crisis. But the crisis is neither doing
overall damage to China's economy nor slowing sustained economic
development, he confirmed.
</P>
<P>
Li attributed this to China's increased economic strength due
to the reforms of the past two decades, effective governmental
measures, and China's rational foreign-debt structure.
</P>
<P>
Similar financial disturbances may appear again since an
unjust and irrational international political order still exists,
Li stressed.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he pointed, in the global economy China must keep
sight of the challenges as well as the opportunities, the
unfavorable as well as the favorable aspects.
</P>
<P>
The developing countries should learn to protect themselves and
avoid economic risks during this period of globalization, Li
advised.

<HEADLINE> Sweden Confirms Secret Middle East Talks in Stockholm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Swedish Minister of Foreign
Affairs Anna Lindh said Friday that Palestine and Israel have been
holding secret talks in Stockholm since 1994.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli talks held in the past four years in
her country were of great importance to the Middle East peace
process, Lindh said.
</P>
<P>
The minister voiced hope that the talks would help pave the way
for peace in the region, but she didn't release details of
previous talks.
</P>
<P>
With the former Minister of Foreign Affairs Sten Andersson
acting as a go-between, Israel and Palestine began their secret
talks in Stockholm four years ago when they concluded the famous
Oslo talk, according to the Tidningarnas Telegrambyra, the Swedish
news agency.
</P>
<P>
The two sides focused their talks on issues such as the Jewish
settlement, the repatriation of refugees, and the status of
Jerusalem, the agency quoted sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
No information was revealed about the people attending the
secret talks. It is reportedly too sensative a problem that could
affect the continuation of such talks.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat is scheduled to visit
Stockholm over the weekend. With the revelation of the past secret
talks, his visit is drawing more attention.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has been invited by the Swedish Ministry of Foreign
Affairs to attend a ceremony in memory of a secret diplomatic
mission carried out in Stockholm in 1998 which contributed to the
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Lindh, on Tuesday, denied recent speculations that Palestine,
Israel and the United States intended to hold a secret summit
sometime before or after the ceremony.

<P>
On the Middle East situation, Hu pointed out that China
supports the just cause of the Arab people, the peace process in
the region, and the efforts made by Syria to safeguard its
national sovereignty and territorial integration by peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
He said that China highly appreciated Syria's strategic choice
to resolve the Arab-Israeli disputes through peaceful
negotiations. "China attaches importance to the role played by
Syria in regional affairs, and considers relevant U.N. resolutions
and the principle of "land for peace" the basis for Mideast peace
negotiations and the Golan Heights as an integral part of Syrian
territory," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The key to the development of the peace process in the region
is that relevant parties concretely implement the agreements and
accommodations already reached," he said, adding this is also the
essential condition for guaranteeing the security and stability of
all countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
Musharaqah said that Syria is determined to resolve the Mideast
problem through peaceful negotiations in a thorough and just
manner. He highly commended China's important role in
international and regional affairs and expressed gratitude for
China's consistent support of Syria and the just cause of the Arab
people.
</P>
<P>
He considers that the Mideast peace process has entered a
crucial period and hopes that China, a permanent member of the
U.N. Security Council, can play a more positive role in this
regard.
</P>
<P>
Hu and Musharaqah briefed each other on their respective
domestic situation and had an in-depth exchange of views on
international issues of common concern and other regional problems.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the talks, Hu hosted a welcoming ceremony in honor of
Musharaqah.
</P>
<P>
Musharaqah arrived in China this morning for an 8-day official
visit at Hu's invitation. In addition to Beijing, the Syrian
guests will also visit the southwest provinces of Sichuan and

<HEADLINE> EU to Bring Germany to Court on Improper Levy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) said
here Friday that it would bring Germany to the European Court of
Justice for its levy, which is deemed inappropriate, on German
artists and writers who live outside the country.
</P>
<P>
The levy has violated certain principles contained in EU
Regulation 1408/71, whereby a person should only be subject to the
legislation of a single EU member state for social security
purposes, the commission said.
</P>
<P>
According to the commission, the contribution would finance
health care and pensions for artists and writers who are paid by
publishers or galleries.
</P>
<P>
The commission, the EU's executive body, believes that Germany
should not impose such a levy on German artists and writers who
reside in another EU member state.
</P>
<P>
EU rules say that such people, when they live and work outside
Germany, are not covered by the German social security system.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, when Germany places a levy on their works of art,
these artists and writers have to pay social security both in
their home country and the country where they live.

<HEADLINE> HIV/AIDS Possible Explosion Threatens Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam should take more and
quick action if it is to avoid an HIV/AIDS explosion as some
countries have suffered, the Saigon Times Daily reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The English-language daily quoted analysts' warning following
shocking figures released recently.
</P>
<P>
Since the first HIV case in Vietnam was discovered in 1990, the
number has grown to 10,268 HIV/AIDS cases, said a report by the
National AIDS Prevention and Fighting Committee.
</P>
<P>
In the tropical diseases center in Ho Chi Minh city, a major
aids hospital in the south, doctors said 280 HIV cases were
treated there in the first eight months of the year, compared to
only 35 cases for the whole of 1994.
</P>
<P>
Patients there come from occupations including civil servants,
police officers, teachers, business people rather than mainly drug
addicts and prostitutes as previously, doctors said.
</P>
<P>
A study of 113 aids deaths shows that 59 died of opportunistic
diseases before they passed to the final aids period.
</P>
<P>
In the sixth ASEAN HIV/AIDS Task Force Meeting held in Hanoi
late October, Vietnam was projected to have between 10,000 and
15,000 aids deaths out of the estimated 135,000 to 160,000 HIV
positive cases by the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Endeavor Blasts Off With Second Element for Station </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The delayed U.S. space
shuttle Endeavor blasted off before dawn at 3:35 Friday from Cape
Canaveral, Florida, with six astronauts and the U.S.-built Unity
module, the second element for the international space station,
lighting up the dark sky on their way to orbit.
</P>
<P>
Endeavor's mission is to rendezvous with an unmanned Russian
power station Zarya module put into orbit November 20, and to get
the Unity connected with Zarya, forming the basis for the future
assembly of the international space station.
</P>
<P>
During Endeavour's 12-day flight, the astronauts will use the
shuttle robot arm to capture the Russian piece and attach it to
the American component. Then two astronauts will perform three
spacewalks to hook up all the electrical connections and cables
between the two cylinders.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. piece, Unity is a connecting passageway. It is
essentially an aluminum can with big holes where other chambers
eventually will attach. It contains six miles of wiring and more
than 50,000 mechanical pieces.
</P>
<P>
Owing to the alarming in a cockpit, the space shuttle delayed
its take-off 24 hours. Engineers and controllers on the ground
finally determined that the alarm was caused by a momentary low
pressure indication, but that all the shuttle's hydraulic systems
were working properly. However the alarm pose no threat to the
mission.
</P>
<P>
Once a third element--a Russian command module with living
quarters for astronauts--is added in 1999, the station will
become functional. Upon completion, the space station will
stretch 361 feet end to end, and become one of the brightest
objects in the night sky.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Building Permits Value Down in October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The value of building permits
for housing in Canada fell for the second straight month in
October to its lowest level in two years, Statistics Canada said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Canadian municipalities issued about 910 million U.S. dollars
in housing permits in October, down 5.8 percent from September.
</P>
<P>
"It was the lowest level for residential construction
intentions since October 1996," the statistics agency said.
</P>
<P>
Activity in Canada's residential sector has been slowing since
the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
The decline has been the result of lagging single-family
dwelling construction intentions, which represent about 70 percent
of the residential sector.
</P>
<P>
Housing resales also continued to edge down in October. "This
is consistent with softening consumer confidence and with the
trend and outlook for the general economy," the agency said.
</P>
<P>
In the non-residential sector, the value of building permits
dropped 10.2 percent to 780 million dollars in October.
</P>
<P>
In October, the overall value of building permits in the
country declined 7.9 percent to about 1.7 billion dollars, the
agency said.

<HEADLINE> Primakov: Lack of Confidence Worsens Russia's Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The Russian economic recovery
is hindered by the lack of confidence, Russian Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov said here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a meeting of the World Economic Forum in Moscow,
Primakov said a total loss of confidence is the biggest danger
for Russia's reforms.
</P>
<P>
Poorly planned imports, the overvalued ruble, and high tax
policies strangled producers in Russia and deepened the crisis,
in addition to the ineffective banking and government systems, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The premier also said the moratorium imposed on August 17 on
the payments due on government securities destroyed investors'
confidence in Russia's government and commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
Refuting a claim that the government would ban the circulation
of the U.S. dollar and call for an end to importation, Primakov
said, "This has not been done, and will not be done."
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors' interests will not be ignored, but we will
continue to give priority to direct investments in the real
production sectors rather than the short-term programs, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said Russia will continue to expand relations with
international financial organizations but will base relations on
its own interests and circumstances.
</P>
<P>
Referring to privatization, the premier said that the
privatization process is not and will not be reversed." But the
previous governments' privatization programs have been marred "by
some contradictions and distortions."
</P>
<P>
There will be no overall nationalization, but there will be
state regulation. There will be no redistribution of property, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Primakov warned at the meeting that the country's crisis could
become permanent if Russia continued the previous economic
policy.

LONDON, December 4 (Xinhua) -- More than a hundred Romanians
were being questioned by police on Friday after what was believed
to be one of the largest single round-ups of suspected illegal
immigrants in the UK.
</P>
<P>
The 103 people, thought to be Romanian gypsies, were arrested
on Thursday at Dartford International Ferry Terminal, after
travelling by boat from the Belgian port of Zeebrugge.

Those held, including children and babies, were due to be

transporting them to four police stations in west Kent.
</P>
<P>
Kent social services officers were also drafted in to help cope

<P>
"This is certainly the largest number that I've heard of," said
Inspector Berry. "We sometimes see about 15 at a time, I've never
seen this number before.

<TEXT>

<P>
BEIJING, December 4 (Xinhua) -- President of the Supreme
People's Court Xiao Yang urged all courts in China today to go
all out to create an honest and competent brigade of judges with
sound political and professional qualities.
</P>
<P>
"It is essential for us to enhance our work efficiency and
ability, and to safeguard justice," Xiao said at a national
meeting highlighting the Haidian District People's Court of
Beijing as the country's top model court.
</P>
<P>
The court was praised for training many of its judges as
experts in hi-tech fields, capable of handling a large number of
cases related to hi-tech and intellectual property rights.
</P>
<P>
Zhongguancun, known as China's "Silicon Valley," is within
this jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
"The court, with integrity and fairness, has tried many cases
that were the first of their kind in China," Xiao said.
</P>
<P>
Xiao told all court officials to step up efforts to establish
an effective and well-regulated system to replace the existing
system of "rule by men" inside the judiciary, in order to foster
the growth of quality judges.
</P>
<P>
Another official, Wang Shengjun, secretary general of the
Central Politics and Law Committee of the Communist Party of China,
said the issue of quality in law enforcement will be an ongoing one
and must be the first priority of the judicial system.
</P>
<P>
"This is fundamental to rooting out judicial corruption," he
said.

Presidents of provincial level Higher People's Courts and
judicial staff from throughout Beijing attended today's meeting.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Jobless Rate Edges Down to 8.0 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Canada's jobless rate edged down
0.1 percentage points to 8.0 percent in November, Statistics
Canada said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The job gain pushed the overall employment rate up to 60.3
percent in November, the first time since 1991 that the rate has
been above 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
In November, employment rose by an estimated 103,000, bringing
gains so far this year to 425,000, the statistics agency said.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the strong gain in employment in November, the number of
unemployed was little changed due to an increase in labor force
participation," the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Most of the increase in employment in the month was in
full-time work. So far, the full-time jobs have increased by
302,000 this year.
</P>
<P>
Part-time jobs rose by 29,000 in November, offsetting the

<HEADLINE> Minister Warns Garbage Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 4 (Xinhua) -- China's Minister of Science and
Technology Zhu Lilan said today that garbage disposal has become a
pressing issue in China's environmental protection campaign.
</P>
<P>
"In 1996, Chinese cities disposed 100 million tons of garbage,
and the figure is expected to hit 150 million tons in the year
2000," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, every Chinese living in cities produced 440 kg
garbage annually, according to Zhu, adding that they have polluted
soil, underground water and atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
She said that Chinese are still using "primitive methods" to
dispose garbage. "They simply put garbage in the open air or cover
them up with earth," she said.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 Chinese cities are floating in a sea of garbage
weighing 6 billion tons, according to Zhu.
</P>
<P>
To change the situation, the whole nation should be aware that
garbage is valuable and they can be converted into useful materials,
such as fertilizer and energy.
</P>
<P>
Zhu suggested that advanced foreign methods be introduced in
dealing with the problem. Garbage must be collected in a
scientific way, and government will make policies in this respect,
she said.
</P>
<P>
She urged departments and companies to develop garbage disposal
technology, and build a sound management system.

<HEADLINE> Chiluba Urges Political Parties to Have Dialog </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 4 (Xinhua) -- President Frederick Chiluba
Friday urged all political parties in Zambia to promote the
political culture of dialog.
</P>
<P>
Chairing an inter-party talks focusing on Zambia's political
problems such as constitutional changes and electoral process
here, Chiluba asked the ruling and opposition parties not to
blame each other but engage seriously in dialog to find out means
to resolve the country's problems and difficulties.
</P>
<P>
"I realize this is not the place and time for us to try and
push on blames. This is no time to blame anyone," said the
president who was seen as a "neutral person" to chair the talks
that were abandoned in 1992 and resumed late this year.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba noted that after the abandonment of the process of the
political dialog, Zambia's political climate got very
contaminated and polluted.
</P>
<P>
As a result, very few political parties were ready to listen
to each other and "there were charges and counter-charges,
allegations and counter-allegations," said the president.
</P>
<P>
He called on all political parties to decide deliberately and
seriously to engage in dialog.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba attached great importance to the meeting, saying it
demonstrated "our faith and confidence in ourselves" and spoke
volumes for "our willingness and readiness" to resolve Zambia's
problems and difficulties as a nation.
</P>
<P>
The eloquent leader pinned his hope on the meeting and asked
all parties to do their best for the nation.
</P>
<P>
"I believe together we can create a climate, together we can
create an environment, together we can create an atmosphere, in
which politics will be healthy and sound, in which politics will
be the business of distributing the resources to help develop the
country and improve the conditions of the life of our people,"
Chiluba concluded.
</P>
<P>
The inter-party talks attracted 22 political parties including
the ruling Movement for Multi-party Democracy (MMD) and the
largest opposition party, the United National Independence Party
(UNIP), led by former president Kenneth Kaunda.

<HEADLINE> EU Survey Shows Optimistic Economic Picture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Consumer confidence in the
European Union (EU) improved in November this year, an EU business
and consumer survey revealed on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The improvement was to a large extent the result of a more
optimistic view by consumers on the present and expected economic
situation, said the survey.
</P>
<P>
However, industry managers lowered their production
expectations and the expected number of booked orders. This
contributed to a decline in the industrial confidence indicator in
November, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
The survey also pointed out that the indicator is in line with
its long-term average for the euro-zone, which will start to adopt
the euro beginning January 1 next year.
</P>
<P>
With the pickup in share prices and improved consumer
confidence, the survey said, the overall economic sentiment
indicator rose in November but is now dropping to a lower level.
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted by the EU Directorate General for
Economic and Financial Affairs.

</P>
<P>
The office said Lake's efforts will closely follow the line
given by the recent Organization of African unity (OAU) summit in
Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso.
</P>
<P>
"Ethiopia remains committed to a peaceful solution to the
crisis and appreciates the efforts made by Mr. Lake in this
regard," the office added.
</P>
<P>
The OAU summit mediation committee on Ethio-Eritrean border
dispute, held in Burkinabe capital on November 7 and 8, came up
with a set of proposals on the peaceful solution to the border
dispute.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia has accepted the OAU proposals while Eritrea has
rejected the key element of the peace plan which calls for the
withdrawal of its troops from the disputed Badme area.
</P>
<P>
The proposals will be submitted to the summit of central organ
of OAU Mechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management and
Resolution scheduled to be held in Ouagadougou on December 17 and

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong's Hang Seng Bank Opens Beijing Office </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong-based Hang Seng
Bank today opened a Beijing representative office, expanding the
bank's network in inland areas to two branches and three
representative offices.
</P>
<P>
Located downtown in the COFCO Plaza, the Beijing representative
office is the first established by the Hang Seng Bank in north
China.
</P>
<P>
Vincent H.C. Cheng, vice chairman and chief executive of the
bank, said at the opening ceremony that this move marks another
milestone in the bank's business development in inland areas.
</P>
<P>
"The representative office will be a key strategy point for the
bank to enhance its relationship with the central government as
well as our customers with operations in Beijing," he said. "It
will also complement our network of inland branches and offices as
a liaison with Hong Kong companies seeking to invest and expand in
north China."
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1933, the Hang Seng Bank is a principle member of
the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Group, and the
second largest locally incorporated bank in Hong Kong, employing a

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Expresses Concern over Indian Military </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 4 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman from Pakistan's
Foreign Ministry said Friday that the massive Indian military
exercises across the border will vitiate the atmosphere of peace
and stability.
</P>
<P>
Expressing his concern at India's massive military exercises,
the spokesman said that "such aggressive posturing" can only
vitiate the atmosphere between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He noted that India is conducting military exercises close to
Pakistan's border while employing the latest weaponry in its
arsenal, and the military exercises come at a time when the two
south Asian nations are engaged in bilateral dialogue.
</P>
<P>
"The exercises send a negative signal and bode ill for the
promotion of an atmosphere of peace, security, confidence and
trust in the whole of South Asia," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said, according to reports, Prithvi missiles were part of
the sophisticated weaponry which was integrated in the exercises.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the flexing of military muscles is
"pointless," as Pakistan is fully capable of its defense and
territorial integrity.

<HEADLINE> WHO Warns of Snail Fever Scourge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Schistosomiasis, also known as
snail fever, if not controlled could develop into a liver and
urinary tract disease and bladder cancer, the World Health
Organization (WHO) warned here Friday.
</P>
<P>
In a drive to gain international recognition for the disease
which affects over 200 million people worldwide, over 50 experts
from 22 countries met from December 2-4.
</P>
<P>
The infection, carried by water-borne tiny worms, can cause
severe organ damage if untreated. Victims suffer from liver,
urinary, lung and nervous system disorders.
</P>
<P>
"We have an effective drug, praziquantel, which kills all the
Schistosome species as well as a course of treatment which only
costs between 30 and 40 U.S. cents," said Dr Lorenzo Savioli, head
of WHO's Schistosomiasis and Intestinal Parasites Control Team.
</P>
<P>
"But the numbers of people affected means that buying
sufficient quantities of the drug is beyond what most developing
countries can afford," he added.
</P>
<P>
The schistosomiasis problem has long been associated with the
growth of agriculture in developing countries. A schistosomiasis
problem surfaces each time a dam or other agricultural
developments are undertaken.
</P>
<P>
Experts say there is a direct link between the disease and the
existence of stagnant bodies of water, inadequate water and
sanitation systems.
</P>
<P>
The WHO noted that countries like Brazil, China, Egypt and
Morocco have set examples for exerting easy-to-implement measures
that effectively control and even eliminate schistosomiasis.
</P>
<P>
Scientific evidence has shown that a single dose of
praziquantel can reverse 90 percent of urinary tract lesions in
school children after only six months, while regular treatments,
given to children between the ages of 5-15, can prevent long-term
consequences in adulthood.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Seek Ex-President's Extradition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President
Robert Mugabe has made it clear that he would seek the
extradition of former president Canaan Banana from South Africa,
South African Press Association reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe Thursday told reporters in London, where he is on a
private visit, that Zimbabwe would seek the extradition of
Banana, who was convicted by a Harare court on charges of sodomy
and indecent assaults.
</P>
<P>
Banana fled to Botswana and then to South Africa last week, on
the eve of his conviction. He said there had been political
pressure on the judiciary to convict him.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said he had been informed of Banana's escape from the
country and that the former president had talked to both leaders
of Botswana and South Africa, Festus Mogae and Nelson Mandela,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
"I talked to President Mogae when I was in France and he
informed me that Banana had not sought asylum in Botswana but had
asked for help with his hotel bills.
</P>
<P>
"I am also aware that he met President N. Mandela and I take
it Mandela will be advising him to return home and face the
music. If South Africa refuses to extradite him, that will not at
all affect my relationship with Mandela," Mugabe said.
</P>
<P>
"We have an extradition treaty with South Africa to extradite
criminals who have run away from their country, so we can seek
his extradition," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe's comment contradicted the Zimbabwean government's
earlier statement. A government spokesperson said Harare was
surprised to hear that Banana met Mandela Wednesday, after
Zimbabwean police had issued a warrant for his arrest.
</P>
<P>
A South African presidential spokesman said Thursday that
homosexual acts were not illegal in South Africa, and with South
Africa's strong gay movements, the government had to be careful
to avoid discriminating against Banana.
</P>
<P>
But he said South Africa would cooperate if Zimbabwe went
through the proper channels and approached the authorities for
assistance.

<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA-ATA, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Major member countries of the
Commonwealth of Independent States(CIS) saw their industrial
production in the first 10 months of 1998 drop drastically.
</P>
<P>
Russia's industrial production slid 4.6 percent over the same
period last year, with Ukraine 0.8 percent, Kazakhstan 1.6
percent, Armenia 1 percent and Moldova 8.1 percent, the Interfax
news agency quoted CIS statistics as saying.
</P>
<P>
But Belarus, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Azerbaijan and Georgia
have kept the momentum of industrial growth with an increase rate

Belarus tops the CIS states in consumer price increases this
October with a 21 percent leap above prices last year. Russia and
Ukraine have kept a high inflation rate of 6.2 and 4.5 percent
respectively, the statistics show.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Qiu Ke, 24, who has a degree in
advertising, resigned from a well-known joint venture in Beijing
one year ago and joined the other pioneers who are exploring
China's Internet advertising market, still a novelty in the
country.
</P>
<P>
To date, Qiu's Blue Process Company has 12 domestic clients for
whom it has created Internet ads. These clients include magazines and
securities companies. "Small as it's now, I'm bullish
about this market," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to preliminary statistics, there are now more than 30
companies such as Blue Process in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing-based Stone Rich Sight Company (SRS), which has the
most popular Chinese website in China, has set out to establish
the world's largest Chinese website -- Sina.
</P>
<P>
Deng Hailin, marketing manager of SRS, said that interactivity
is one of the characteristics of the Internet, facilitating
convenient communication between advertisers and
consumers. Advertisers can also accurately calculate the number of
people exposed to their online advertisements.
</P>
<P>
The number of Internet users has rapidly increased over the
past five years. Statistics show that about 80 million computers
were connected with the Internet worldwide by last year, and this
figure is expected to reach 200 million.
</P>
<P>
Advertising on the Internet has also become a booming
commercial activity in Western countries. Experts predict that the
world gross ad investment will reach five billion U.S. dollars in
2000.
</P>
<P>
China's Internet market is closely following the world pace. The
country currently has 1.17 million users, and the figure will
reach two million by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
These people are mainly in their twenties and thirties, and are
well-educated and well-paid, said Deng.
</P>
<P>
Most insiders and officials agree that China's Internet ad
market will make rapid progress in the next five years, though it
is not mature now.
</P>
<P>
Deng said that current Internet ad income, which mainly
comes from the information industry, is only less than one percent
that of traditional mass media.

<P>
LUANDA, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The 8th session of the Central
Committee of the ruling People's Liberation Movement of Angola
(MPLA) has said Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos has
been chosen as the only candidate for the party chairmanship.
</P>
<P>
In its communique issued here Friday, the 8th session of the
MPLA central committee which just ended Thursday night made the
decision. It also decided to hold MPLA's 4th National Congress
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The 8th session of the MPLA central committee expressed "great
concern" over the crisis in the Angolan peace process.
</P>
<P>
It attributed the faltering peace process to the "obstinate
obstruction" by Jonas Savimbi, president of the opposition
National Union for Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), calling
him a "war criminal."
</P>
<P>
The MPLA central committee reiterated that the Angolan
government will cut any relation with the "armed wing of UNITA"
and will only have dialog and cooperate with the peace-loving
UNITA Renovation Commission in completing the 1994 Lusaka Peace
Protocol.
</P>
<P>
The communique noted that the forthcoming party congress will
discuss the "serious social and economic situation" facing Angola
and work out a program for the economic development in the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
The theme of the MPLA national congress is "MPLA and the
Challenge in 21st Century."
</P>
<P>
Angola launched its privatization process in 1991. However,
almost all of the privatized state enterprises are controlled by
foreigners and the Angolan national economy is on the brink of
collapse.

<HEADLINE> China's Swimming Down, Says Japanese Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 4 (Xinhua) -- China's swimming is backsliding
while Japan's rising, said Japan's swimming team leader Tsuyoshi
Aoki here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-one-year-old Aoki, who came to the Thammasat University
aquatic center to observe Chinese swimmers' first workout, said
"China's swimming is down and Janpan's rise."
</P>
<P>
Though Japan is expected to beat China in the medal hunt in the
pool, Aoki remained as cautious as before and refused to make any
comments about that.
</P>
<P>
Instead he said repeatedly: "China is still very strong (in
swimming)."
</P>
<P>
Aoki said he was sure that Mai Nakamura and Masami Tanaka will
win their respective specialties of women's 100-meter butterfly
and 200-meter breaststroke.
</P>
<P>
"If the Asian Games was held last year, Japan would have been
no match to China in swimming." said Aoki.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Sturgeon Released For Scientific Studies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese fish experts today
released hundreds of young Chinese sturgeon into the Minjiang
River in east China's Fujian Province, hoping to gather data for
researches on the rare specie's spawning migration habits.
</P>
<P>
The 400 small fish, 50-100 centimeters long and weighing 2-5
kilograms, were put into the Minjiang River which is believed to
be the sturgeon's main breeding ground.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese sturgeon is known as a living fossil as it is one
of the oldest vertebrates in the world. To save it from
extinction, China has placed it under first-class protection and
set up several nature reserves and a breeding center in the city
of Putian in Fujian.
</P>
<P>
The young sturgeons released today came from the breeding
center which has hatched over 3,000 Chinese sturgeons. If this
release proves successful, the center will put more young
sturgeons into the river to boost its number in the wild,
officials at the center said.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania's Domestic Debt Rises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's domestic debt
stock comprising government securities and contingent liabilities
stood at 940.2 billion Shillings or 1.4 billion U.S. Dollars in
late October, up 8.7 percent over the previous month.
</P>
<P>
The increase can be explained by a rise in securities and
contingent liabilities, said a monthly economic review by the
Bank of Tanzania (BoT), the central bank.
</P>
<P>
Government securities which include stocks, bonds, treasury
bills, promissory notes and tax reserve certificates went up by
10.5 percent, due to increases of 18.1 percent and 4.5 percent in
bonds and treasury bills respectively, said the newly published
report.
</P>
<P>
Government bonds rose from 314.7 billion Shillings to 384.5
billion (one U.S. Dollar equals to 660 Shillings), following the
government decision to re-capitalize National Micro-Finance bank
by issuing bonds worth 69.7 billion Shillings to bridge the
bank's financial gap.
</P>
<P>
Treasury bills increased from 110 billion Shillings recorded
at the end of September 1998 to 115.1 billion at the end of
October, said the report.
</P>
<P>
During the period under review, according to the report,
contingent liabilities increased by 4.8 percent, from 110.1
billion Shillings at the end of September to 115.5 billion at the
end of October.
</P>
<P>
The increase originated from a 7.5 percent rise in the BoT
revaluation account, following the depreciation of the Tanzanian
Shilling, it said.
</P>
<P>
Domestic debt by creditor category at the end of October
reveals that the BoT and commercial banks are the main holders of
the government securities (stocks and bonds), each accounting for
42.5 percent, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Other financial institutions hold 9.9 percent, while other
banks hold 2.5 percent. Official entities hold 1.5 percent and
the rest account for 1.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The bank said during October, the government issued checks
worth 3.2 billion Shillings to service stocks and bonds. About
500 million Shillings were used to service October dues, while
the rest was used to settle part of long over-due interest
arrears.
</P>
<P>
Despite the substantial payment during the month, interest
arrears continued to surge by 2.1 percent, reaching 120.3 billion
Shillings, compared with 117.8 billion recorded at the end of
September 1998.
</P>
<P>
The October interest on the BoT 25 percent special stock
amounting to 5.2 billion Shillings, largely accounts for the
increase in interest arrears, said the report.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Raises Civil Servants' Retirement Age </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The Civil Service of the
Singapore government Friday announced it has decided to raise the
civil servants' retirement from the age of 60 years to 62 years, a
move deemed in reaction to the worrisome trend of rapid aging of
population in the country.
</P>
<P>
Under the new policy, the Civil Service, as an employer, will
allow civil servants to carry on working until 62 years old
subject to wage adjustment where applicable.
</P>
<P>
It will also extend the right to pensionable officers if they
wish to.
</P>
<P>
In exchange for the statutory right given to employees to
continue working and earning a regular income, employers will be
given the discretion to adjust wages of employees aged 60 years
and above up to a maximum of 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
About 970 Civil Servants in Singapore, pensionable and
non-pensionable, will turn 60 years old in 1999 and they will be
able to take advantage of the policy to work until 62 years old.
</P>
<P>
In the last decade, residents aged 60 years and over in
Singapore increased from 8.5 percent in 1987 to 10.1 percent in
1997. By the year 2030, there will be one elderly person above 65
years old for every five Singaporeans.

<HEADLINE> Chile's Go-between Offers Pinochet Compromise Deal: Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 4 (Xinhua) -- A Chilean politician is in
London to persuade his former leader Augusto Pinochet to accept a
diplomatic compromise which might solve the extradition crisis he
faces, The Daily Telegraph said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said that Pablo Longuaira, a member of the
Rightist Independent Democratic Union Party, was trying to arrange
a deal in which Pinochet would be interrogated in Britain by the
Spanish judge seeking his extradition.
</P>
<P>
Longuaira acts as an intermediary for the centre-left Chilean
government to talk directly with the former Chilean leader, the
Paper said.
</P>
<P>
It said Longuaira had also suggested that Pinochet consider
issuing an apology to the victims of his 17-year rule, during
which more than 3,000 people were, alleged by the Spanish judge,
killed or disappeared.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Telegraph said Longuaira arrived in the British
capital on Wednesday and had seen the 83-year-old Pinochet at his
new luxury rented house southwest of London.
</P>
<P>
General Pinochet regards Longuaira as " a son," the Paper said.
</P>
<P>
But the paper did not say whether the proposed compromise would
be acceptable to Spanish Judge Baltasar Garzon, who has requested
Pinochet's extradition.
</P>
<P>
It was also not clear whether such a deal could be agreed by
the British legal system.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Home Secretary Jack Straw must decide by December 11
whether the extradition proceedings against Pinochet can proceed.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet was kept under police guard in London on October 16 on
a warrant from Spain. On Tuesday, he moved into a large house in a
wealthy area southwest of London while waiting to hear Straw's
decision.
</P>
<P>
Britain's highest court ruled last month that Pinochet was not
immune from prosecution, opening up the prospect of extradition.

<HEADLINE> China Disappointed about Macao's 1999 Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 4 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official said
here on Friday that China feels disappointed about the Macao
government's decision to incorporate its accumulated fiscal
savings of past years in the 1999 budget.
</P>
<P>
"The accumulated fiscal savings are Macao's wealth and should
be turned over to the government of the Macao Special
Administrative Region (SAR), which will lay a foundation for the
future development of Macao," said Han Zhaokang, chief
representative of the Chinese side of the Sino-Portuguese Joint
Liaison Group.
</P>
<P>
Han made the remarks after the four-and-a-half-hour meeting
with his Portuguese counterpart.
</P>
<P>
According to Han Zhaokang, China put forward the point of view
in November of 1997 that China should participate in drawing up
the 1999 budget of the Macao government. In September this year,
the Macao government agreed to hold consultations in this regard
and submitted an outline of the new budget in late November this
year.
</P>
<P>
In the course of consultations, the Chinese side proposed some
opinions on certain points of the budget which might affect the
future SAR government. One major opinion is that the current Macao
government should not put the fiscal savings into the budget.
</P>
<P>
However, the Portuguese Macao government holds that the
incorporation of accumulated savings is aimed at increasing the
"transparency of the budget."
</P>
<P>
Han Zhaokang noted that the Chinese side does not oppose such a
purpose as long as the Macao government makes a promise that it
will not draw on the savings. But the Macao government would not
like to make the promise.
</P>
<P>
China once again showed a flexible attitude, agreeing that the
Macao government can use an appropriate sum of the savings if it
meets unforeseeable financial difficulties next year. But it
should notify the Chinese side in advance. However, the proposal
was not accepted.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese side feels disappointed about this," Han Zhaokang
said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the budget issue, the two chief representatives
also discussed the detailed arrangements of the Chinese
government's stationing of troops in the future Macao SAR, pension
for retired civil servants of the Macao government, the official
status of the Portuguese and employment of people from outside
Macao.

<HEADLINE> Mandela's Meeting with Banana Denounced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 4 (Xinhua) -- South African opposition
parties have reacted with outrage to reports that President
Nelson Mandela met fugitive former Zimbabwean president Canaan
Banana at his official residence in Pretoria Tuesday, describing
it as a diplomatic faux pas.
</P>
<P>
The Citizen daily Friday quoted Pan Africanist Congress
spokesman Mike Muendane as saying that Mandela had no right, as a
representative of the South African nation, to resent the country
in that way.
</P>
<P>
"We strongly condemn the meeting on the basis that Banana is a
fugitive and that his here illegally. The president is therefore
encouraging others to come here illegally and is sending a
message that anyone is welcome in South Africa illegally,"
Muendane said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said South Africa should respect the Zimbabwe's
law. Banana should be deported to Zimbabwe to receive his
sentence on charges of sodomy.
</P>
<P>
Banana, 62, was convicted in absentia by the Harare High Court
last week of using his position as president between 1980 and
1987 to force men, aides, bodyguards and a gardener, to submit to
sex with him. A warrant was issued for his arrest when he fled
the country.

<HEADLINE> Former Zimbabwean President Surfaces in S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Fugitive former Zimbabwean
President Canaan Banana has finally surfaced in South Africa and
has already held a private and confidential meeting with South
African President Nelson Mandela, the Daily Herald reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
S. African Presidential Spokesman Parks Mankahlana Thursday
confirmed that Banana had seen Mandela Wednesday in a "private
and confidential" meeting held at the request of Banana.
</P>
<P>
However, Mankahlana gave no further details but said Banana
had not asked for asylum as widely expected. He would not say
whether or not Banana was still in that country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the South African government has said it will not
facilitate the capture of Banana unless it is formally approached
by Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a telephone interview with the Herald Thursday,
Mankahlana said Banana, although considered a criminal in
Zimbabwe, had not committed a crime in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The South African government, even if knowing his whereabouts,
had no reason to arrest him unless Zimbabwe formally requested to
do so.
</P>
<P>
Banana fled Zimbabwe last week before the high court convicted
him on 11 counts of sexual offenses committed while he was still
in office.
</P>
<P>
The High Court has issued a warrant for his arrest after the
conviction.
</P>
<P>
Banana is believed to have first gone to Botswana before
entering South Africa.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's New Car Sales at 4-Year Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 4 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's new
vehicle sales slumped 16.2 percent to 13,884 units in November
year on year, the worst level in four years, dashing hopes for a
speedy recovery in the industry.
</P>
<P>
Sales were down 13 percent compared with the 15,961 units sold
in October, the National Association of Automobile Manufacturers
of South Africa (Naamsa) said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The figure represented the lowest November month's sales in
the last 12 years, The Star paper Friday quoted Naamsa as saying.
</P>
<P>
The continuing falling sale was mainly a result of
exceptionally high interest rates, which bit into business and
consumer expenditure, Naamsa said. It reflected ongoing weakness
in the economy as a whole, the organization said.
</P>
<P>
South African new car sales have been on a downward trend that
started two years ago, but the pace accelerated this year when
official interest rates were hoisted to a decade-high during a
five-month currency crisis starting from late May.
</P>
<P>
Lending rates have begun to come down gradually, with
commercial banks' prime rate currently at 23 percent, but car
assemblers and dealers said more cuts were needed to revive the
ailing industry.
</P>
<P>
"Prospects for any recovery in new vehicle sales, in the
medium term, would depend on the extent of expected further cuts
in bank lending rates," Naamsa said.
</P>
<P>
The industry anticipated that a modest recovery in new vehicle
sales would only materialize during the second half of 1999, it
said.
</P>
<P>
Naamsa figures showed that in this year to date total new
vehicle sales were 293,447 units, 14.3 percent lower than the
342,419 units achieved in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
He warned of further job losses throughout all sectors of the
motor industry, as he believed that the vehicle market was
unlikely to pick up before the third quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Figures showed that employment in the motor industry fell to
77,500 in 1997 from a peak of 82,100 in 1996. It further dropped
to 73,400 in the first quarter of 1998, according to annualized
figures.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia Friday launched
the second round polio immunization program with an aim to
vaccinate eight million children under the age of five against
polio and measles.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia has a plan to eradicate polio by the year 2000 and
the polio eradication campaigns have been conducted twice each
year in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Launching the 3-day second-round immunization campaign, Ali
Abdo, President of Addis Ababa City Administration, said in the

development program gives priority to the countrywide polio
immunization campaign.
</P>
<P>
The president pointed out that the major objective of the
national basic health service for children is to prevent and
control diseases which are immediate causes for their deaths.
</P>
<P>
Ali said the immunization campaign which has just been
launched is part and parcel of the basic health program being
conducted to protect children from fatal disease.
</P>
<P>
According to Ali, 92 percent of children under the age of five
years in the capital city were vaccinated against polio in the
last two years and the first round immunization campaign this
year respectively, and 97 percent of children were provided with
vitamin A during the first round of the campaign conducted in
November this year.
</P>
<P>
During the second round campaign, 204,123 children under five
will be vaccinated at 464 vaccination posts in the capital city.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the ceremony, N. Nyambi, resident representative
of the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), expressed
support for the Ethiopian government in the eradication of polio
by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The UNDP official said that more than 100 staff of the U.N.
and international volunteer organizations will be part of the
60,000 volunteers mobilized by the Ethiopian Health Ministry in
support of the immunization program.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania's External Debt Rises in October: C. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's external debt
reached 8,288.2 million U.S. Dollars at the end of October, a 2.5
percent rise from the same period last year, according to a
report by the central bank.
</P>
<P>
A monthly economic review by the Bank of Tanzania (BoT) said
that out of the total amount of external debt, disbursed
outstanding debt was 6,818.8 million U.S. Dollars while committed
undisbursed debt was 1,469.4 million Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The profile of disbursed outstanding debt by creditor category
reveals that multilateral and bilateral debts are the largest
accounting for 48.7 percent and 44.2 percent of the total debt
respectively, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The proportion of total debt owed to commercial sources and
other private creditors is very small, accounting for 4.2 percent
and 2.9 percent respectively, it added.
</P>
<P>
Further, the structure of disbursed outstanding debt by
borrower category shows that the Tanzanian government is the
largest borrower, owing as much as 93.7 percent of the total
debt.
</P>
<P>
The proportion of public corporations and private sector in
the total debt is 2.7 percent and 3.6 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
When classified by economic sectors, the disbursed outstanding
debt reveals that for the period ending October 1998, 24.9
percent of the debt was disbursed in the form of balance of
payments support, while agriculture, transport and
telecommunications received 14.2 percent and 20.4 percent,
respectively, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Energy and mining received 11.9 percent, followed by
industries which absorbed eight percent of the debt. Social
welfare and education, finance and insurance and tourism received
4.2 percent, 2.9 percent and 1.2 percent of the debt,
respectively, while the remaining 12.3 percent of the debt was
absorbed by other sectors, according to the bank.
</P>
<P>
The report further said during October 1998 no new loans were
contracted. However, disbursements amounted to 24.2 million
Dollars, while the actual debt service topped to 21.6 million
Dollars. Accordingly, there was a net inflow of 2.6 million
Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The BoT report said implementation of Paris Club V Agreed
Minute up to the end of October 1998 shows that debts worth 371.2
million U.S. Dollars have been canceled, 584.5 million have been
rescheduled and 9.6 million have been deferred.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Limits Movements for Local Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian voters are expected to
move freely from their houses to the polling centers but are
restricted to move between states and electoral wards during
December 5 local government elections.
</P>
<P>
Alhaji Adamu Muazu, the secretary of the Independent National
Electoral Commission (INEC), was quoted as saying Thursday in
Abuja that the restriction of movement covering inter-state,
intra-local government and electoral wards would last from 8 a.m.
to 2.30 p.m. Saturday.
</P>
<P>
As part of the security measures, the Nigerian government
announced last week that all borders with neighboring countries
would be closed as from December 4 or Friday to forestall
infiltration of foreigners into the country for voting.
</P>
<P>
INEC Chairman Justice Ephraim Akpata said Thursday that the
commission had suspended indefinitely the conduct of elections in
troubled parts of the country until the restoration of peace and
order in those areas, according to a Daily Times report Friday.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the INEC decided not to hold elections in those
areas because "we cannot afford risking the lives of our staff."
</P>
<P>
There is security alert in all states of the west African
country ahead of the December 5 local government elections seen
as a litmus test for General Abdulsalam Abubakar's transition
program, media reports said.
</P>
<P>
Lagos State Police Commissioner Sunday Aghedo put his men on a
compulsory 24-hour-duty with effect from Thursday till the
conclusion of Saturday's elections.
</P>
<P>
About 9,000 policemen will be involved in Lagos area to ensure
that the elections are not disrupted, he said, adding that about
2,000 para military men had been enlisted to assist the force
during and after the elections.
</P>
<P>
About 6,996 chairmanship and 79,830 councillorship candidates
of the nine provisionally registered political parties are
expected to participate in the competition for the 774 seats of
local governments in Saturday elections.
</P>
<P>
The Saturday elections will determine which three among the
nine parties will get INEC's final nod. Under Nigeria's
electoral guidelines, political parties would be finally
registered if they scored five percent of total votes of the
local elections in at least 24 out of 36 states in the country.

afternoon, one day after 400-member delegation arrived here for
the 13th Asian Games.
</P>
<P>
Attending the ceremony were Chef de Mission Yuan Weimin, deputy
chief Xu Yinsheng and Mayor of the athletes village Choopong
Kiansiri with some 100 Chinese athletes and officials at the
central square of the village in the scorching sun.
</P>
<P>
The national flags of Turkmenistan and Bahrain were also
flown in the ceromony.
</P>
<P>
"We unite here in Thailand from diverse historical, cultural,
ethnic, and religious backgrounds for the common purpose of
goodwill and competition, " Kiansiri said in a speech.
</P>
<P>
He Huixian, spokeswoman of the Chinese Olympic Committee, said
the Chinese athletes are very satisfied with training conditions
and accomodation here.
</P>
<P>
"I can say that hotels here are as good as those of Atlanta
during the 1996 Olympic Games," she said.
</P>
<P>
While commenting on complaints about Bangkok's chaos in
transportation and other organizing work, the spokewoman
attributed it to Bangkok's lack of experence.
</P>
<P>
"When Bangkok held the 1978 Asian Games, there were only 3,000
athletes. 20 years later, there are about 10,000 athletes and
3,000 reporters," He said. "They have made great efforts to do
like this."

NICOSIA, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The United States President
Bill Clinton is ready to become personally involved in the Cyprus
issue in order to achieve a breakthrough in the problem, Cyprus
News Agency said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Clinton met Thursday with 16 prominent Greek Americans to
discuss the Cyprus issue. U.S. National Security Advisor Sandy
Berger and State Department Cyprus Coordinator Thomas Miller were
also present at the meeting, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton expressed his intention to become personally involved
in the issue, as was also asked by the Greek Americans at the
meeting, and try to achieve something in the coming two years of
his tenure in office.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated
south and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since Turkey
landed its troops and took over the northern third of the island
in 1974 following a failed pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
Peace efforts on Cyprus issue have come to a standstill since
the summer of 1997, when Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash
demanded international recognition of his breakaway state in
northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has said it fully backs a fresh effort by the United
Nations resident representative in Cyprus Ann Hercus for a

<HEADLINE> US Officer Calls for Closer Military Ties with China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Admiral Joseph Prueher,
commander in chief of the U.S. Pacific Command, said here Friday
that the communication between military leaders of China and the
United States is good and improving at a steady pace.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a luncheon hosted in his honor by the Asia Society
Hong Kong Center, Prueher said that as part of the "constructive
strategic partnership" called for by both the Chinese and
U.S. presidents, the U.S. Pacific Command aims to promote
military-to-military ties with China.
</P>
<P>
"First, we want to develop and increase understanding by moving
our military relationship beyond the very senior policy, foreign
affairs and protocol channels and into more routine operational
channels," Prueher said.
</P>
<P>
"Second, we want to continue expanding our contacts to bring
younger, more-junior American and Chinese officers together," he
said. "Our experiences with senior PLA (People's Liberation Army)
officers are rewarding and have benefited both countries," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Prueher said that a secure and stable Asia is a goal that both
China and the United States share and the common goals and
interests between the two countries far outweigh the differences.
</P>
<P>
"We remain optimistic that we can forge a relationship with
China that will meet our mutual interests and work to the benefit
of all nations of the world," Prueher said, adding that it will
come only with increased understanding and clear communication.
</P>
<P>
Prueher arrived in Hong Kong Friday morning as a part of his
official call to several Asian countries and regions. He has been

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Basketball teams in
competition at the 13th Asian Games are allowed to reshuffle or
change players even after they have submitted lists to the
games. However, the changes must be sought before the matches
begin.
</P>
<P>
This was confirmed by Dr. Prathum Muangmee, sports manager
for basketball, after there was some confusion among basketball
team managers over whether the players could be changed.
</P>
<P>
"I reaffirm that the rules of the Asian Basketball
Confederation allow such changes providing team managers meet
before and approve the substitutions," he said.
</P>
<P>
Team managers will meet on Saturday at 2:00 pm at The
Raddison Hotel, during which changes of players can be sought.
However, all players must be certified by their own National
Olympic Committee and the ABC, he said.
</P>
<P>
Dr, Prathum pointed out that the ABC complies with the
International Basketball Federation. "In fact, we have notified
all the teams that such changes are possible upon their
notification to the team managers' meeting," he added.
</P>
<P>
Certification by a national Olympic committee is to ensure
that basketball players are truly from the countries and regions
they claim to represent. After that, they need to have ID Cards
to be eligible for competition, Dr. Prathum explained.

attorney general.
</P>
<P>
"We will leave it completely to the attorney general to decide
what effective measures should be taken to implement the
presidential instruction," he said.
</P>
<P>
On Soeharto's attitude toward the investigation of his alleged
hidden wealth, Akbar said the former president is always ready to
be questioned, even without being put on house arrest.
</P>
<P>
President B.J. Habibie on Wednesday issued Presidential
Instruction, instructing Attorney General Ghalib to fight
corruption, collusion and nepotistic practices and take judicial
action against Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto was forced to step down on May 21 amid the country's
worst political and economic crisis in decades. He is accused of
corruption and abuse of power during his 32 years in power.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Maintain Perfect Record at Asiad football </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANNGKOK, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Hosts Thailand maintained a
perfect record after beating Oman 2-0 in a Group F match at
Suphachalasai Stadium on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The host team, which beat Hong Kong of China 5-0 in their first
group match, totally outplayed their Oman opponents and took an
early 2-0 lead at half time.
</P>
<P>
Worawoot Srimaka opened the scoring at the 13th minute after
completing a quick counter-attack with a right-footer just inside
the penalty area.
</P>
<P>
T. Damrong-Ongtrakul made it 2-0 for the host country at the
40th minute, again thanks to their effective counter-attack.
</P>
<P>
Srimaka got a yellow card in the second half and hit the post
once. He had several more scoring chances but failed to grasp any
of them.
</P>
<P>
The Oman team, which beat Hong Kong of China 6-0 in their first
outing at the 13th Asian Games, appeared tiring early in the match
and could not match the pace of the host team.
</P>
<P>
Their defence line looked weak while their forwards could not
get the support they badly needed from their teammates as the
mid-field was dominated by the Thai team.
</P>
<P>
In a Group Pool A match played on Friday, South Korea trounced
Vietnam 4-0.
</P>
<P>
The South Koreans, one of the favorites of the tournament,
proved they are still the title contenders despite they lost to
Uzbekistan 2-3 in their first match.
</P>
<P>
The South Koreans squandered a 2-0 lead in the match against
Uzbekistan to concede three goals in a row in the second half.
</P>
<P>
But in the match against Vietnam, the South Korean team
shrugged off the shadow and dominated the match from the very
beginning.
</P>
<P>
By halftime, the South Koreans were already 2-0 up and they
went on to score two more goals in the second half to seal up
their group competitions with a sweet victory.

<P>

by Tory peers against William Hague by pressing ahead more swiftly

</P>
<P>
Financial Times:
</P>
<P>

<P>
The Guardian:
</P>
<P>
-- The credibility of William Hague, the leader of the
Conservative Party, and all the leadership team sagged under fresh
blows on Thursday when four peers resigned from the front bench
and two back-benchers quit the party in protest over the sacking of
Lord Cranborne.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Telegraph:
</P>
<P>
-- Prime Minister Tony Blair was on Thursday night striving to
rebuild his status as a senior European leader after Germany
further marginalized the government by officially backing moves to
end the national veto over European Union tax policy.
</P>
<P>
The Independent
</P>
<P>
-- Europe's central bankers delivered an unprecedented
synchronized cut in interest rates across the Continent on
Thursday in response to fears of a global economic slowdown.

<HEADLINE> Foreigners in S.Korea Can Tour Mt. Kumgang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Foreigners in South Korea can
tour the Mountain Kumgang in the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea (DPRK) without going through any additional process, South
Korean Ministry of Justice said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Foreigners in South Korea will not be required to ask for
permission for reentry or apply for visas before going on the trip
to the Kumgang, said a spokesman of the ministry.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made at a meeting on immigration presided over
by Justice Minister Park Sang-cheon.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, the minister pledged continued efforts to
improve conditions for foreign residents and to attract more
foreign tourists.
</P>
<P>
From next year, the ministry will allow citizens from about 150
countries, with which the nation has concluded no visa agreements,
to stay in South Korea for 30 days without visas, instead of the
current 15 days.
</P>
<P>
The measure is taken under the principle of reciprocity as
these countries allow South Koreans to stay there for up to 30
days without visas.
</P>
<P>
To help further promote exchanges between South Korea and
China, Chinese businessmen who want to make frequent visits to
South Korea will be issued multiple visas, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry will no longer make it mandatory for associations
of foreign residents to register with South Korean authorities. It
will also simplify the procedures of issuing residence permits to
foreigners.

PARIS, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading French newspapers on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- While the Washington conference on robbed Jewish properties
of arts ended on Thursday without taking any legally binding
measure, the U.S. automobile producer Ford was accused by a
Jewish lawyer of collaborating with the German Nazis during World
War II and exploiting prisoners and deportees in its plant in
Cologne, Germany, to provide equipment for the Wehrmacht.
</P>
<P>
-- Israel once again suspended the application of the Wye
Plantation agreements with Palestinians after Palestinian students
protesting Israel's refusal to release their companions attacked two
Jews in Ramallah Wednesday afternoon. Israel released 250
Palestinian prisoners last month in accordance with the Wye
agreement, but 150 of them were prisoners of common laws instead of
political prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- By lowering their key interests rates to 3 percent, the
central banks of 11 European countries to join the single
currency have in fact hurried the birth of the euro. The measure
by European banks put an end to their dispute with the United
States Federal Reserve and affirmed their unity and capacity to
respond to the economic situation in the world.
</P>
<P>
-- Two young French architects, Marcelo Joulia and Alain Renk,
plan to build temporarily two towers in the shape of the Pyramids
on the Notre Dame Catheral of Paris to celebrate the coming of
the 21st century. By choosing the historic monument as its basis,
the project has the symbolic meaning of going beyond the time and
achieving eternity.

<HEADLINE> Injury Forces Chinese Top Gymnast out of Asiad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese gymnast Lu Yufu has pulled
out of the Bangkok Asian Games becuase of a knee injury he sustained
in practice Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The 20-year-old Lu, key member of the 1997 world champion team,
tore his knee ligament in practice on vaulting horse, which is his
leading event and the top chance for gold medal in the Bangkok
Games which starts on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"Lu is the leading gymnast in vaulting horse and floor
exercises. He would be China's top hope in the two events," said
Huang Yubing, head coach of the Chinese gymnastics team.
</P>
<P>
China will replace Lu Yufu by Zhao Sheng, who is to fly to
Bangkok from Beijing on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Zhao, also 20, is waiting for the approval by the Asian Olympic
Council and the Asian Games Organizing Committee.
</P>
<P>
Lu's injury would not lower China's gold target of eight to 10
in the gymnastics competition, in which China has dominated for
the last two Asiads.
</P>
<P>
"Without Lu we'll still win eight to 10 gold medals here," said
Huang. "What I'm really worried about is whether he could recover
in time for the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games."
</P>
<P>
Lu jumped to international fame in the East Asian Games last year,
where he captured three gold medals in team, floor exercises and
pommel horse.

<HEADLINE> China Expects 16 Shooting Golds at Asiad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese marksmen and women are
targeting 16 golds at the Asian Games shooting competitions which
start on Monday, a Chinese official said here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"We are confident that we could win one more gold medal here than
the last Asian Games. That means 16," said Chinese Shooting
Association President Feng Jianzhong.
</P>
<P>
Feng added that China, which won 15 golds, 13 silvers and 10
bronzes at the last Asian Games in Hiroshima, will try to keep its
top position in Asian shooting despite challenges from South
Korea, Japan and former Soviet Union repulics like Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese shooting team is spearheaded by veteran pistol
shooter Wang Yifu and world championships runner-up Wang Xian, and
contains a batch of shooters who obtained good results at World
Cup series.
</P>
<P>
The hot, humid weather here could cause problems for shooters,
who need concentration and composure in competition.
</P>
<P>
Chinese coach Xu Haifeng, who is in charge of the women's
pistol shooters, gave a confident prediction, saying that his
students would win three of the four golds at stake.
</P>
<P>
Xu told Xinhua his shooters were highly motivated because among
five shooters who came here, four will be fielded and it was still
undecided who would be axed.
</P>
<P>
He rated Japan's Yoko Inada and South Korean Shin Eun-Kyung as
their main rivals.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese squad arrived here on Tuesday but had to wait until
Friday to train in the ranges at Hua Mark Sports Center.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Novelist Depicting Effects Of Rural Reforms (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, December 4 (Xinhua) -- At the beginning of the
novel "Cang Sheng" (Common Folk), which portrays China's rural
reforms, a man named Ba Fulai who has his label as a landlord
removed is holding a wedding feast for his son and
daughter-in-law, who comes from a poor peasant family.
</P>
<P>
He doesn't expect the village leaders to show up to
congratulate him, and, embracing his son, he says, "Can this be
true?"
</P>
<P>
This description by the well-known novelist Hao Ran does away
with the political distinctions for landlords and their offspring
during the Cultural Revolution (1966-76) that permeated his two
famous novels "Bright Golden Road" and "Bright Sunny Skies".
</P>
<P>
These two novels, published in the '60s and '70s, were Hao
Ran's depictions of the class struggle in people's communes in
rural areas that were some of the few novels permitted during the
Cultural Revolution.
</P>
<P>
But "Cang Sheng", which was published in the 1980s and which
won the China Popular Literature Award in 1990, is a narrative of
the changes in rural areas resulting from the reforms, including
changes in people's attitudes toward the political notion of class.
</P>
<P>
Literary critic Lei Da says that "Cang Sheng" represents the
great changes in rural areas, especially ideological changes, of
people freeing themselves from the ideological shackles of "class
status" and turning to the rural reforms.
</P>
<P>
The 66-year-old Hao Ran now lives in a village in Sanhe County
in Hebei Province.
</P>
<P>
In late 1978, when he was writing the third part of his novel
"Bright Golden Road", he learned that farmers in the village of
Xiaogang, Fengyang County, Anhui Province, had taken the lead in
breaking up cikkective farmland for household use, a beginning of
the rural reforms.

<TEXT>
<P>
"At first I could not accept the changes," Hao Ran says, "I was
rather angry and felt a little loss at what was happening in rural
areas."
</P>
<P>
He says that it was the Communist Party that led workers and
farmers in seizing state power, but the farmers began to correct
the Party's mistakes. "I thought that I could not write about what
was happening in the countryside and that my writing career was
nearly over."
</P>
<P>
In the years after 1978, Hao Ran visited more than 100 counties
in northeastern and northern parts of China, especially villages
that had been sources of stories in his two previous novels.
</P>
<P>
The changes he saw made him aware of the actual disasters that
had resulted from the people's communes and how farmers had been
stimulated by the new household contract system, which linked
income to output.
</P>
<P>
During the people's commune period of 1958 to 1978, about 400
million farmers were living below the poverty line, but now the
number of poor in rural areas has been cut to 30 million, he says.
</P>
<P>
Having been encouraged by the enthusiasm of farmers he saw, Hao
Ram resumed writing about farmers, and their sorrows and awareness
during the reforms.
</P>
<P>
In "Bright Golden Road", when a villager used a spade to scrape
the characters "Build Family Fortune" on the wall of the house of
the village's head Zhang Jinfa, all other villagers applauded
it. But in his new novel, villagers in the mountains near Beijing
are busy making money from local exports, something that was
regarded as a "capitalist tail" during the people's commune period.
</P>
<P>

MANILA, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government and
the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) will set up Friday four
monitoring centers tasked to look after truce violations between
government forces and MILF guerrillas in a disputed zone in
Maguindanao, Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine News Agency reported that the monitoring centers
will strategically be erected in the Datu Piang-Shariff
Agwak-Talayan complex in Maguindanao Province, the site of recent
fierce fighting between government troopers and MILF rebels.
</P>
<P>
The observation posts will be placed along Crossing Laubani in
Upper Bagan, Talayan; Crossing Salbo in Datu Piang; and Tumaig and
Meta in Shariff Agwak, it said.
</P>
<P>
Teams that will man each post will compose of representatives
of the government and the MILF, civilians and local police
elements.
</P>
<P>
The clashes between the government and MILF forces early this
week in the area killed four soldiers and three rebels and wounded
dozens of combatants from both sides.
</P>
<P>
The conflict also displaced some 500 families who fled their

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Investigates Former Government Departments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Less than three days after
Salim Hoss was designated as Lebanon's new prime minister, the
state judicial authority embarked on a probe into accusations
against former government departments and officials.
</P>
<P>
There have been reports in recent days that documents of the
former ministries of finance and the displaced have been removed
or burned, the Daily Star said Friday.
</P>
<P>
State Prosecutor Adnan Addoum ordered security agents Thursday
to investigate these claims which were strongly denied by outgoing
Minister of State for Financial Affairs Fuad Sinyoura, the paper
added.
</P>
<P>
Sinyoura, a close ally of the outgoing Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri, said the documents were being removed from the ministry's
old offices to the new headquarters.
</P>
<P>
There are filed copies of all documents in the ministry's
archives, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said he had phoned Adnan asking him to clear the air and
expressed his regret for the spread of rumors during the
government's transitional phase.
</P>
<P>
In another judicial development also targetting allies of
Hariri, Beirut public prosecutor Abdullah Bitar has started an
investigation into four former key government officials.
</P>
<P>
They were accused of seizing a real estate property and
annexing it to Solidere, the country's biggest company responsible
for rebuilding war-destroyed Beirut central district. The company
is seen as Hariri's brainchild.
</P>
<P>
Hariri, a billionaire construction tycoon, has been
spearheading during his six-year term under former President Elias
Hrawi a massive reconstruction program to rebuild the country from
the ravages of the 15-year-old civil war.
</P>
<P>
His sudden departure was believed to have much to do with his
disagreement with the new president, Emile Lahoud, over the
make-up of a new government.
</P>
<P>
As Hariri refused the nomination by Lahoud to resume
premiership, Hoss, a prime critic of Hariri's economic and social
policies was named as the new prime minister Monday.

MANILA, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' inflation rate
for November jumped to 11.2 percent from 10.2 percent in October
as a result of recent typhoon damage, the National Statistics
Office said in a report Friday.

by food price hikes.
</P>

The biggest prices hikes were recorded in typhoon-struck areas,
such as Cagayan Valley, Ilocos and Central Luzon, where supply and
distribution of food commodities were significantly affected.
</P>
<P>
The office said that the average inflation for the first 11
months of this year was 8.8 percent.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The Russian State Duma is
expected to submit to President Boris Yeltsin a new bill on the
ratification of the START-II treaty on banning intercontinental
ballistic missiles (ICBM) in Russia and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Under the original treaty, the two countries will destroy all
their multiple-warhead ICBMs by 2003 and cut the number of
single-warhead ICBMs on both sides to between 3000-3500.
</P>
<P>
In the new version, "Russia's military doctrine is to be
implemented, and it is Russia's policy to create new weapons so
that the national security can be completely ensured," said Duma
speaker Gennady Seleznyov.
</P>
<P>
The new bill, prepared by three key committees of Duma, will be
sent to Yeltsin after being deliberated within Duma until December
8.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. ratified the START-II treaty in January 1996, but the
Russian Duma, the lower house of Russian parliament, has
repeatedly refused to discuss the treaty, claiming it would put
Russia at a strategic disadvantage compared with the U.S.

LOS ANGELES, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Copper price fell to
11-year low Thursday on U.S. market, while the prices of aluminum,
zinc and nickel also slumped on concerns about a shrinking demand
for industrial commodities.
</P>
<P>
At the New York Mercantile Exchange, copper for March delivery
lost 1.45 cents a pound, ending at 68.80 cents, the lowest level
since July 1987.

Meanwhile, three-month aluminum ended at 1,264 dollars a ton,
the lowest level since March 1994. Three-month nickel price
dropped by 100 dollars a tonne, hitting 4,030 dollars.
</P>
<P>
"There are ample supplies in some of these commodities markets,
but demand is likely to be lower next year than this year. The
interest rate cuts by European central banks today did little to
stop the slide in commodity prices," said David Rinehimer,
director of commodity research at investment bank Salomon Smith

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Export Sector to register Positive Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's export sector
is poised to chalk up positive growth this year, a reflection of
its continuing export competitiveness despite the currency turmoil
which had placed the sector under stress since 1997, the Ministry
of International Trade and Industry announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
In its 1997/98 report released here, the ministry said the
sector would continue to be the main source of growth for the
economy.
</P>
<P>
Export-oriented industries are expected to institute
appropriate measures to reduce costs to mitigate against the
negative effects arising from the depreciation of the ringgit to
remain competitive, it said.
</P>
<P>
The report said that export earnings of major commodities are
expected to register increases in ringgit terms, reflecting the
gains in the exchange rate valuation.
</P>
<P>
In terms of volume, imports are expected to decline, due to
policy measures instituted to reduce imports.
</P>
<P>
However, import value is expected to increase at a higher rate
in 1998 than in 1997, reflecting the increases in the prices of
the merchandise imports,
</P>
<P>
Based on these factors, merchandise exports are expected to
register a strong growth than imports, which would result in a
higher surplus in 1998 than in 1997, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It said Malaysia's competitiveness was further heightened by
the country having moved up one notch to become the 18th largest
world exporter in 1997 according to the World Trade Organization
while it maintained its 17th position in terms of imports.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's total merchandise trade last year grew by 12.2
percent to 442.4 billion ringgit (116.421 billion U.S. dollars)
from 394.2 billion ringgit (103.736 billion U.S. dollars) in 1996,
with exports up by 12.4 percent to 221.4 billion ringgit (58.263
billion U.S. dollars) while imports rose by a slightly lesser
margin of 12 percent to 221 billion ringgit (58.157 billion U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
This led Malaysia to chalk up a higher trade surplus of 424
million ringgit (111.578 million U.S. dollars) from a deficit of
253.7 million ringgit (66.763 million U.S. dollars) in 1996, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The report partly attributed the growth of 12.4 percent in
exports last year from only 6.5 percent in 1996 to the favorable
impact of the ringgit's depreciation on the competitiveness of
local products and the improved global demand for semi-conductors.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's share of world merchandise trade declined marginally
to 1.4 percent in 1997 from 1.5 percent in 1996, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia continued to maintain a liberal trading environment
although there were increases in import tariffs on construction
materials, heavy machinery and vehicles, the report noted.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN, the U.S., Japan and the EU together accounted for 73.4
percent of the country's total trade in 1997, a slight decline
from the 73.9 percent share in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Light Truck Outsells Cars in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Trucks outsold cars for the
first time in monthly U.S. vehicle sales in November, according to
results released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
November light truck sales for the industry, including pickup
trucks, mini-vans and sport utilities, grew 4.5 percent to 582,927,
giving them 51 percent of the market. Cars fell 0.3 percent to
562,190.
</P>
<P>
"We have forecast continuing growth in the entire light truck
market," said David Cole, director of the University of Michigan's
automotive transportation studies office.
</P>
<P>
Studies show the continuing rise in truck sales has been driven by
a robust economy, low gasoline prices and Americans' growing demand
for the roominess and increasingly car-like luxury of big
sports-utility vehicles and pickups.
</P>
<P>
However, for the whole year, cars still occupy 52 percent of
the market, while 48 percent held by trucks.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said trucks can easily overtake cars on an annual
basis if automakers put incentives on segments such as full-size
sport utilities.
</P>
<P>
Luxury model sport utility vehicles will be the hot sellers

<HEADLINE> Iran Starts Massive Military Maneuvers in Gulf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Iran's elite Islamic
Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) and the Army started joint
military maneuvers in the Gulf and the Gulf of Oman early Friday
morning, Tehran radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The war games, code-named "Vahdat-77" (Unity-77), is being
carried out from the strategically important Strait of Hormuz at
the mouth of the Persian Gulf to the waters close to Chabahar in
the Gulf of Oman.
</P>
<P>
About 20,000 troops would be participating in the five-day
military exercises and some Omani military experts will observe
the maneuvers, earlier report said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the official news agency IRNA on Friday quoted
spokesman for the war games Brigadier General Issa Golvadi as
saying the maneuvers are for peace and security in the region,
once it gets free from foreign military presence.
</P>
<P>
The change of the code-name from "Victory" to "Vahdat-77" is a
sign of Iran's full confidence and trust in the broadening of deep
relations on defense issues with regional countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
Terming the move as a goodwill to the Gulf states, the
spokesman said that before the start of the war games, six shells

<HEADLINE> U.S. Chip Industry Group Details Position in Y2K </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, December 3 (Xinhua) -- A lobbyist group for the
U.S. semiconductor industry has urged individuals and businesses
to contact the manufacturers of finished electronic products to
figure out whether they are Y2K ready.
</P>
<P>
In a position paper on the Year 2000 issues released Thursday,
the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) headquartered in San
Jose, California, said it is important that people inform
themselves about the Y2K issues and take appropriate steps to
ensure that their electronic systems function properly in 2000.
</P>
<P>
The paper was released when the Year 2000 spotlight turns to
chips embedded in consumer electronics systems and no one can tell
how many of them might fall.
</P>
<P>
The Y2K bug comes from antiquated hardware and software formats
that denote years in two-digit formats in electronic systems. On a
practical level, this means that many electronic products, from
computers to video recorders, may not be able to determine whether
the digits "00" stands for the year 1900 or 2000. The phenomenon
may cause some products to malfunction on January 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
With a great deal of effort and expense, these systems can be
repaired or replaced. But most observers agree that the biggest
and most widespread disruption might be caused by embedded systems,
which are used to control, monitor or assist the operation of
equipment, machinery or plants.
</P>
<P>
According to the SIA paper, which provides an overview of the
semiconductor industry's role in addressing Y2K issue, the vast
majority of semiconductors are incapable of generating, comparing
or sorting data information.
</P>
<P>
"In general, semiconductor companies do not design or develop
the software programming for the semiconductors they sell," SIA
said. "In the vast majority of cases, distributors or other
entities create the programming. That is why, in the final
analysis, individuals and businesses will have to contact the
manufacturers of finished electronic products to ascertain whether
those products are Y2K ready."
</P>
<P>
But SIA said that chip companies are conducting extensive
research and evaluation programs to resolve Y2K issues under their
control. At the same time, these companies are working
cooperatively with their suppliers and customers to settle
problems.

<HEADLINE> Africa to Recover Quickly: World Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Sub-Saharan Africa could be
one of the regions in the world which will recover most quickly
from the effects of the current Asian economic crisis, the World
Bank predicts.
</P>
<P>
According to the bank's Global Economic Prospects and the
Developing Countries report for 1998 and 1999, issued Thursday,
Africa will see a two-percent fall in its trade for this year,
mainly because of lower commodity prices.
</P>
<P>
But the bank predicts that next year, Africa should again see
growth rates recover to an average of 3.2 percent, second only to
Asia's growth rates.
</P>
<P>
With many African countries having started putting in place
open and coherent macro-economic programs, recovery should
continue in the next millennium, the bank was quoted by Friday's
Daily Nation newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
The bank notes that Africa should benefit from the fact that
European demand for African commodity and horticultural products
remains strong.
</P>
<P>
Africa also tends to be excluded from the sharp movements in
currency flows that have so damaged east Asian economies over the
last year, it adds.
</P>
<P>
The bank expects commodity prices to improve worldwide next
year and says that east Africa, in particular, should by then be
recovering from the devastating effects of the El Nino weather
phenomenon, which damaged both the tourism industry and
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the bank cites the below-average growth in Nigeria
and South Africa as the main reason for Sub-Saharan Africa's
growth decline, from around five percent in 1995-96 to 3.5
percent last year and an estimated 2.4 percent this year.

<HEADLINE> Iran Offers to Help Resolve Rome-Ankara Row </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi has announced Tehran's readiness to help resolve the row
between Turkey and Italy over Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi made the offer upon his return from a visit to Italy,
the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
He said that the crisis could be resolved peacefully through
political negotiations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Italy and Turkey have been locked in a dispute over Ocalan
since he was arrested in Rome on November 12.
</P>
<P>
Turkey asked the Italian government to extradite Ocalan,
leader of the outlawed Kurdish Workers Party (PKK), which has been
fighting for independence in southeastern Turkey in the past 14
years.
</P>
<P>
But Rome refused the request, citing its constitution forbading
extradition of a suspect to any country where the death penalty is
applied.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Tehran-Rome ties, Kharrazi said that both Iran
and Italy voiced readiness to further promote political, economic
and cultural cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi hoped for further expansion of relations with Italy,
one of the big trade partners of Iran.

<HEADLINE> Slow Clearance Costs SADC Much </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Delays in clearing commercial
traffic and cargo at border entry points cost member countries of
the Southern African Development Community (SADC) 60 million U.S.
Dollars annually.
</P>
<P>
A number of deficiencies in both infrastructural, structural
administrative and operational arrangements at borders in the
region are responsible for this cost, according to Southern
African Transport and Communications Commission (SATCC).
</P>
<P>
Times of Zambia Friday quoted SATCC working group member
Heather Chalcraft as saying that poor infrastructure at the
borders, unharmonized customs classification system, excessive
paperwork in customs clearance, poor communication between
customs and clearing agencies are among the bottlenecks
identified at border entry points.
</P>
<P>
She said some of the recommendations made by SATCC like the
single document customs clearing facility is already being
implemented in some member countries.
</P>
<P>
The costs incurred in the SADC economies arose from the
inter-connection in commercial transactions between manufactures,
transporters, industries wholesalers and all stake holders in
commerce.
</P>
<P>
The SATCC has recommended border entry points be run by the
private sector to improve efficiency, she said.
</P>
<P>
Chalcraft said that SATCC holds that if private concerns are
to run border entry points in terms of providing facilities
amenities and general administration they will be run much more
efficiently.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Cambodian Economy Hard Hit by Political </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The formation of Cambodia's
new coalition government led by sole Prime Minister Hun Sen is a
good news for the whole country, especially for its battered
economy.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia held its National Assembly election on July 26. The
three major political parties -- the ruling Cambodian People's
Party (CPP) led by then second prime minister Hun Sen, FUNCINPEC
party headed by Prince Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy's self-named
opposition party -- won all 122 assembly seats.
</P>
<P>
As none of the three parties gained two-thirds of the seats
necessary to form a new government on its own, the CPP, the first
major party winning 64 seats, must align with another party or the
other two parties to form a new government.
</P>
<P>
But FUNCINPEC and Sam Rainsy Party (SRP) rejected the outcome
of the election, saying the CPP won it through fraud and
intimidation. This led to a political deadlock for four months.
</P>
<P>
The protracted political uncertainty and the impact of the
regional financial crisis since July last year have made the
economic situation worse, with consumer spending down, prices of
basic goods surging and everyone from vendors to garbage
scavengers struggling to make ends meet.
</P>
<P>
Particularly worrying was the continuos rise in prices and the
devaluation of the riel, of which the exchange rate against the
U.S. dollar has fallen in the past 18 months from 1/2500 to
1/3900.
</P>
<P>
International aid which accounts for about half of the
government's revenue decreased sharply. And investment is
continuing to slump with investors either losing their confidence
or taking a wait-and-see attitude.
</P>
<P>
The government's inability to control corruption resulted in
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) canceling its loans.
</P>
<P>
Tourism industry, which is a main source of revenues of the
country, was greatly hit. For the first seven months of 1998, the
number of tourist arrivals reached only 121,000, decreasing by
32.1 percent compared to the same period last year. Hotel
occupancy rates hovered at between 10 and 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
Between 1993 and 1996, Cambodia's economic growth averaged six
percent, but the growth dropped to just two percent in 1997 and it
will not reach three percent this year, according to the Asian
Development Bank (ADB).
</P>
<P>
Economic recession and political instability also caused a
series of social issues. People's living standard continues to
drop. So far, nearly 40 percent of Cambodian citizens still live
in poverty, and more than half of those are not getting enough
food to eat.
</P>
<P>
The year of 1999 will be a crucial year for Hun Sen's new
government to deliver its promise to build an "economic
government."
</P>
<P>
Cambodia's economic recovery will face a lot of difficulties
and challenges.
</P>
<P>
First of all, although there are some indications that
investors will be interested in spending money in a stable
Cambodia, it is unlikely that they will pour in cash overnight.
Prior to 1997, most investors were from Singapore, Malaysia and
Thailand -- countries now are struggling with their own economic
woes.
</P>
<P>
Some Analysts even said Cambodia has lost its traditional
competitive advantages in labor costs because the depreciation of
regional currencies has made other countries' labor costs much
cheaper than those in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, international banking institutions such as ADB, IMF
and the World Bank might not put their top priority on Cambodia.
Instead they might give more loans to South Korea, Malaysia and
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, to attract investment, the new government has to make
economic and administrative reforms to ensure that people don't
turn to corruption as a way to make a living.
</P>
<P>
But, many economists are optimistic about Cambodia's economic
recovery. They listed some advantages, such as the dollarized
economy, relatively not very bad inflation for a developing
economy and the maintaining of macroeconomic stability.
</P>
<P>
As new Prime Minister Hun Sen said on October 22 that "the
important issue is to give a strong and fresh impetus to the
economic development."
</P>
<P>
"These serious requests demand a reform process. In fact we
cannot achieve everything in a day, but if we idle away and wait,
it means death," said Hun Sen.
</P>
<P>
He said, "both the government and the opposition must put the
national interest, social stability and people's livelihood above
all."

<P>
-- During a meeting Thursday night, Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and Gesher Party leader David Levy failed to

Palestinians have been trying to "undermine, ignore and blatantly
violate" everything agreed upon at the summit.
</P>
<P>
Talking to Likud Party members in Tel Aviv, Netanyahu claimed
that Palestinian National Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat and
other senior Palestinian officials have in recent week delivered
speeches that are inciting Palestinians on the street.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot

<HEADLINE> Worldwide Flash Card Market to Boom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Driven by the surging
digital camera market, flash card shipments will increase at a
compound annual growth rate of 69 percent worldwide between 1997
and 2000, according to a market analysis released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The International Data Corporation (IDC), a U.S. market
analysis firm, estimated the flash card market would increase from
221 million U.S. dollars in 1997 to over one billion dollars in
2002, when over 40 million cards would be shipped worldwide.
</P>
<P>
In addition to digital cameras, according to the IDC study, key
drivers for the growth in the flash card market include
networking, smart hand-held and other consumer devices requiring
removable memory.
</P>
<P>
Flash cards are so named because they use flash memory chip,
which holds its content without power. Less expensive and more
dense, flash memory must be erased and written in fixed blocks,
typically ranging from 512 bytes up to 256 KB.
</P>
<P>
The IDC said that worldwide cost per mother-board (MB), the main
printed circuit board in an electronic device, will help drive
card unit growth. Research shows that there has been a 50 percent
reduction in cost per MB within the flash card industry from 1997
to 1998. IDC believes that prices will still drop quickly,
leveling out to less than one dollar per MB by the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Lufthansa, S. Africa Airways to Double Cargo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Lufthansa Cargo and South
African Airways (SAA) will more than double their freight
capacity between Nairobi and Europe next week when they add three
cargo flights to their shared schedule.
</P>
<P>
"We'll be flying six frequencies every week, with the
exception of Monday," Nicolas Danton, regional sales manager for
Lufthansa Cargo, was quoted by Friday's East African Standard
newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We are starting from week 50 with a full program which will
begin Tuesday (December 8)," he said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Danton said the extra capacity was required to handle strong
demand from exporters of Kenya perishables through the European
winter.
</P>
<P>
In an ongoing joint venture, Lufthansa Cargo and SAA will add
three Boeing 747 freighter services to the three McDonnell
Douglas MD-11F flights they already share between Johannesburg,
Nairobi and Germany each week.
</P>
<P>
Danton said Lufthansa Cargo, which sells the north-bound cargo
capacity from Nairobi, will offer 250 tons weekly to Europe from
Kenya until the end of the winter season.
</P>
<P>
Cargo uplifted from Nairobi will account for about half of
each aircraft's capacity, he said, with the rest filled from
Johannesburg.

<HEADLINE> Greater Erosion Control Efforts Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Provinces and autonomous
regions on the upper and middle reaches of the Yangtze and
Yellow rivers have been instructed to accelerate efforts to
curb serious soil erosion.
</P>
<P>
Buhe, vice-chairman of the National People's Congress (NPC)
Standing Committee, today called for strengthened water and soil
efforts in the areas to reduce the adverse effects of heavy
flooding, landslides and various other natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
Heavy summer flooding along the Yangtze, Songhua and Nenjiang
rivers exacerbated erosion problems and heightened the concern of
people across the nation.
</P>
<P>
The NPC Standing Committee dispatched two law-enforcement groups
to the areas in October and November to inspect water and soil
conservation programs.
</P>
<P>
Buhe addressed related problems during a meeting held to review
reports of water and soil conservation inspections carried out in
Sichuan Province which is located on the upper reaches of the
Yangtze River, and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and both
Shaanxi and Shanxi provinces along the Yellow River.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that effective water and oil conservation is
extremely important for maintaining sustainable economic and
social development.
</P>
<P>
The NPC confirmed the achievements related areas have recorded
in afforestation and in both water and soil conservation efforts.
</P>
<P>
Buhe pointed out that China still faces an arduous task in
curbing soil erosion in the two river valleys in spite of a number
of erosion control projects. He also noted major construction
projects and the extensive development of resources have created
new erosion problems.
</P>
<P>
The NPC leader called on local governments at various levels to
strictly implement laws and regulations governing water and soil
conservation, and noted that people's congresses at all levels
should strengthen supervision efforts.
</P>
<P>
He said Sichuan has taken the lead in introducing a ban on
logging in natural forests, and noted that provinces and
autonomous regions on the Loess Plateau should immediately follow
suit.
</P>
<P>
He also called increased afforestation efforts in the areas and
the introduction of additional major projects to control erosion.

<HEADLINE> Corruption Causes Heavy Loss to Bangladesh Airline: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Corruption and irregularities
have caused losses worth 1,049.5 million taka (21.64 million U.S.
dollars) to Bangladesh's national airline, Bangladesh Biman, a
press report here said Friday.
</P>
<P>
A special audit into its 1995-96 accounts also showed that the
airline had a large amount of fund stuck up in bad debt with
agents, the front-paged report in The Daily Star newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Irregular handling of business with sales agents was the
principal cause behind Biman's bad debt, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Instances of mismanagement included credit facility exceeding
agents' bank guarantee, issuance of credit installment without
adjustment of earlier sales accounts and non-payment of money
collected form the sale of tickets by the agents.
</P>
<P>
Biman also suffered losses through unauthorized payment of
incentive commissions, unplanned expenditure for sales promotion,
transport of Bangladeshi deported form abroad, faulty purchasing
processes and excess payment of overtime allowances, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 157 sales agents operated with a bank guarantee of
15 million taka (309,000 dollars), much less than the necessary
133.5 million (2.75 million dollars), which had helped create the
huge debt problem, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The audit found that 11 sales agents owed the airline about
29.6 million taka (610,000 dollars), and 20 travel agents owed
Biman 29.9 million taka (616,000 dollars) which had remained
outstanding for long.
</P>
<P>
Biman suffered a loss of 39.7 million taka (819,000 dollars)
from shipment of Bangladeshi deportees, 243.2 million taka (5.01
million dollars) due to failure to collect outstanding dues, and
overtime allowances accounted for 89.2 million taka (1.84 million
dollars) losses for the airline.
</P>
<P>
Restructuring of Biman's flight operation plan was one way to
reduce its losses, the report said, suggesting the cancellation of
Biman flights on Dhaka-London, Dhaka-New York and Dhaka-Tokyo
routes, which incurred losses of 914.3 million taka (18.85 million
dollars) between 1994 and 1996.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Women Cagers Hungary for Asiad Gold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Without the Asia top center
Zheng Haixia, the Chinese women basketball team, reshuffled in
March of the year, has set an ambitious aim of re-taking the gold
medal after 12 years in the coming 13th Asian Games.
</P>
<P>
"We have paid keen attention to every opponent, and we still
fix our goal on the gold despite a string of unfavourable
factors," said Ma Yuenan on Thursday who took the helm of the
squad in last December.
</P>
<P>
Coach Ma was cornered to field in a squad with 10 debutants for
the Asian Games while chief rivals South Korea and Japan are
steady in their inflow of new bloods into the national squads.
</P>
<P>
For China, with the exception of Zheng Dongmei and Ma Zhongqing
who competed in the last Asian Games, the lack of experiences is
nevertheless their Achilles tendon.
</P>
<P>
"But we are ready to fight against every opponent as we have
our upperhands in height and stamina with an average height of
1.82 meters and an average age of 23.18," said 1.97-meter center
Wang Fuying.
</P>
<P>
In a warmup for the Asian Games, the Chinese cagers have gone
through a 65-day intensive training by playing 18 games on and off
their soils.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese women have achieved their glory by finishing second
both in the 1992 Olympic Games and the 1993 World Championships
when the 2.04-meter Zheng was voted the best center of the world.
</P>
<P>
After their glory in the 1986 Seoul Games, the Chinese squad
was blocked twice by South Korea to repeat its Asiad feat, first
in the final in Beijing, then in the semifinal in Hiroshima.
</P>
<P>
Zheng who was suffering injuries to her back and waist, jumped
to the international fame in the 1985 World Championships, and
became the first Asian woman cager to play in the WNBA when she
was enrolled by the Los Angeles Sparks in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Dispute Between Dhaka, WB Delays Air Quality Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 4 (Xinhua) -- A dispute between Bangladesh and
the World Bank (WB) has delayed the implementation of a WB-funded
air quality management project in the South Asian country's
capital city.
</P>
<P>
The dispute arose when the Department of Environment under the
Ministry of Forest and Environment demanded 250,000 U.S. dollars
to purchase land for setting up air quality controlling check
posts in the city while the WB disagreed, The Bangladesh Observer
newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
To get the financial assistance the WB approved earlier this
year, the Environment Department would have to prepare a project
implementation unit and to appoint a project director, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The department needed to buy land or arrange lease from the
Dhaka City Corporation to set up air quality monitoring equipment,
the report quoted a department source as saying.
</P>
<P>
The WB said there was no need of buying land to set up premises
for the 6.3 million-dollar air controlling program and the check
post would likely to be at Manik Mia Avenue which was already
monitoring the vehicles and conducting a mobile court in the city
for the last one month.
</P>
<P>
Under the project, 20 check posts would be set up in phases
across the city to monitor air quality and vehicle emissions.
</P>
<P>
The Environment Department launched a mobile court late October
and monitored nearly 2,700 vehicles during the last one month. Of
the vehicles, more than 1,700 were cautioned by warning stickers,
nearly 780 were caught with defects and the rest were fined.
</P>
<P>
The department started a similar drive in June this year but
was closed at the end of July because of lack of fund and
cooperation of the police.
</P>
<P>
To control the vehicular air pollution, the major source of air
pollution in Dhaka, the WB and the Environment Department have
proposed to phase out leaded petrol by 1999, ban new licenses and
route permits for two-stroke engines, and introduce compressed
natural gas for vehicles.

<HEADLINE> Indian Government Likely to Put More Public Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government is
considering putting 23 more public sector undertakings (PSUs) on
the disinvestment list as part of its program to privatize all
PSUs except those relating to defense and national security, a
senior official said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The government was going ahead with disinvestment of five PSUs
and another 23 had been recommended for the purpose. In the next
four to five years the government would likely get out of all
state-owned industries except those concerned with defense and
national security. This would cut losses, reduce bureaucratic
interference in their functioning and encourage competition.
</P>
<P>
The exercise for selling shares of Videsh Sanchar Nigam Ltd
(telephone sector) and the Gas Authority of India Ltd is going on.
23 more PSUs are meant for both strategic sale and privatization.
This apart, eight state-owned units will be closed and seven
others have already been recommended for strategic sale, he said.

<HEADLINE> China Eyes 4-5 Table Tennis Golds in Asian Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Without veterans Deng Yaping
and Wang Tao, China lowered their goal to four or five gold medals
in the 13th Asian Games' table tennis competitions.
</P>
<P>
China sent five men and as many women table tennis players to
Bangkok, where they are set to meet tough challenge from South
Korea.
</P>
<P>
The men's team are led by world No. 2 and Olympic champion Liu
Guoliang and No. 3 Kong Linghui, both world champion and World Cup
winner in 1995. The other three are Wang Liqin, Yan Sen and Zhang
Yong.
</P>
<P>
World No. 2 Li Ju, and No. 3 and twice World Cup winner Wang
Nan will spearhead the women's squad which also include world
No. 4 Yang Ying, No. 7 Wu Na and rising star Zhang Yining.
</P>
<P>
"We aim for four or five gold medals here because the games
rules allow only two players from the same delegation in every
event," said China head coach Cai Zhenhua.
</P>
<P>
World No. 1 Deng Yaping has opted out of the Asian Games to
concentrate on her study at Qinghua University.
</P>
<P>
Olympic silver medalist Wang Tao, who holds a nearly perfect
record against South Koreans, was dropped from the team because
of lack of form.
</P>
<P>
With unmatchable depth and pool of talents, China is certain to
win the women's singles title and two team events.
</P>
<P>
In men's singles, only South Korean Kim Taek Soo is able to
shake Chinese dominance.
</P>
<P>
The only Chinese who holds Kim in awe is Wang Tao, who has only
lost one match to the South Korean in dozens of their encounters
in a decade.
</P>
<P>
In the 1995 world championships, Kim beat Wang in the
quarter-finals but he was thrown out of competition because his bat
contained a speed-and-spin-enhancing glue banned by the
Interntional Table Tennis Federation.
</P>
<P>
With Wang Tao in semi-retirement, Kim fears no one.
</P>
<P>
Kong linghui, who fell a prey to Kim in the Atlanta Olympic
Games in 1996, has never won an easy match against the tenacious
South Korean. Their matches usually ended in 3-2, either in favor
of Kong or Kim.
</P>
<P>
Liu Guoliang has lost two matches this year to Kim, who, in
their latest clash, routed the Chinese fast-attacker 3-1 en route
to winning the World Cup silver medal in October.
</P>
<P>
"Kim Taek Soo is very aggressive and he remains China's top
threat," said head coach Cai Zhenhua.
</P>
<P>
China's strongest opponents in doubles events will also come
from South Korea, who claimed to win at least one gold from
these events.
</P>
<P>
"We are on the same par with South Koreans in women's doubles
and a little better in mixed and men's doubles," said Cai.

In a report on the 1999 trade outlook, the association said
increased export of electronics products and automobiles will

<P>
BELGRADE, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Nikola Poplasen, president of
the Bosnian Serb Republic, Thursday strongly protested against the
arrest of the republic's most senior military figure, Radislav
Krstic, by the multinational Stabilization Force (SFOR).
</P>
<P>
General Krstic, commander of the 5th Corps of the Bosnian Serb
Army, was arrested on his way to a general staff meeting near
Bijeljina, in the north of the Bosnian Serb republic controlled by
U.S. troops serving in SFOR, around midday Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He was indicted by the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal for
genocide and crimes against humanity in the 1995 massacre of
Muslims fleeing Srebrenica.
</P>
<P>
According to Tanjug news agency, during a meeting in Banjaluka
with Carlos Westendorp, envoy of the peace implementation council
of Bosnia, Poplasen called the SFOR operation a "traditional
terrorist act," noting that it went beyond the mandate entrusted
to SFOR under the Dayton Peace Accord and violated elementary
requirements of international law.

<HEADLINE> Dong Ethnic Group Entering Outside World (1) (Guangxi Ethnic Group Series-Part 5) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Editor's Note: What follows is
the fifth in a series of stories on the rapidly-changing lives and
culture of the Zhuang, Dong, Miao, Yao, and seven other main
ethnic groups in west China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region
which will mark its 40th anniversary on December 11:
</P>
<P>
Shi Canhui, a member of the Dong ethnic group, picks up a leaf
and puts it to his lips and the whistle-like music reverberates
off the walls of the Guishan Grand Hotel.
</P>
<P>
This "leaf music" helped win the young man his bride, as well a
job in the Guishan, one of the most luxurious hotels in the city
of Guilin, a well-known tourist city of Guangxi.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the songs and dances that he, his wife, and other
members of his ethnic group perform are part of a regular program
that provides entertainment for guests at the hotel.
</P>
<P>
Shi is from mountainous Sanjiang Dong Autonomous County, which
is home to 340,000 Dong people, who are members of one of 18 large
ethnic groups in China, each with a population of more than one
million.
</P>
<P>
In the past, most of the Dong people led isolated lives up in
the mountains or in remote villages. They call themselves the
"jiang", meaning "a place covered with tree leaves".
</P>
<P>
Shi's ancestors never even dreamed of leaving the mountains,
and as late as the early 1950s, there was not even a road into the
self-supporting mountainous county.
</P>
<P>
Since 1980s, however, great changes have taken place in
Sanjiang, with new highways increasing the movement of rural
laborers to cities and television and telephone lines that reached
out-of-the-way Dong villages.

BANGKOK, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Japanese runner Toshinari
Takaoka, who won the 5,000 and 10,000 meters titles in the
Hiroshima Asian Games, has withdrawn from the 13th Asiad because
of a right thigh muscle injury, Japanese officals said.
</P>
<P>
Japan has pinned hope on the 28-year-old Takaoka and champion
sprinter Koji Ito to help them better their haul of five
athletics gold medals in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Tokaoka holds the Games records for both his distances with
times of 13:38.37 and 28:15:48.
</P>
<P>
Team officals said his injury would not recover in time for
the start of the athletics competitions next week.

Traditional Dong architecture is also changing. In the past,
the Dong built wooden houses on the mountainside. Across the river
in front of the village, there was usually a covered bridge to
shield people from the wind and the rain. Chengyang Wind and Rain
Bridge, which is one of the four most famous bridges in China, is
in Sanjiang.
</P>
<P>
Yang Shanren, an experienced carpenter and Chengyang's builder,
said that nowadays few people ask him to build wooden homes,
because with more money available, they prefer a more solid,
fireproof brick home.
</P>
<P>
But, even though these skilled carpenters are needed less in
these parts locally, they are welcome in the cities, where
interior remodelling is a popular thing. And Yang has already
helped build four Wind and Rain bridges in tourist zones in
Beijing and Jiangsu. He has also been invited to use the ethnic
style for buildings in the United States and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The Dong's songs and dances for festivals or romances in the
past have become a new source of income in the tourism
business. The county and townships all have their own troupes and
some local artists have been invited to perform in the cities of
Nanning, the regional capital, and Guilin.
</P>
<P>
Shi Canhui said that over 100 people from his village have
found jobs in cities in tourism, construction, or roadwork.
</P>
<P>
At Linxi Primary School, up in the mountains, a group of girls
in one of the four classes for girls in Sanjiang County, in
colorful ethnic costumes, can be seen using computers.
</P>
<P>
"The classes are designed to give special training to Dong
girls who are generally quite shy by nature," said Yang Shunfeng,
the headmaster. One of them said that she dreamed of becoming a
capable career woman.

<HEADLINE> Brazil's GDP Expected to Drop in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's gross domestic
product (GDP) will fall by 1.4 percent in 1999, according to a
forecast by the Brazilian National Association of Open Markets
Institution (Andima), press reports said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The nation's unemployment rate could go up to 9.9 percent next
year, said the national economic research body.
</P>
<P>
Andima predicted the inflation rate would be 0.6 percent
compared with the two percent forecast by the Institute of
Economic Investigations Foundation.
</P>
<P>
The foundation claimed that the country's primary public
deficit, excluding payment of interests, would balance at the end
of this year and become a surplus equal to 2.2 percent of the GDP
in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Taking into account the payment of interests, the public
accounts nominal deficit will fall to 7.6 percent of the GDP at
the close of 1998, and to 5.5 percent next year.
</P>
<P>
However, the public debt will continue to rise from the 39.5
percent of the GDP of this year to 43.5 percent next year.
</P>
<P>
Most Andima analysts foresee a possible devaluation of the
real, the Brazilian currency, of seven to eight percent in 1999.

<P>
BANGKOK, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Snooker star Marco Fu Ka-chun
of Hong Kong, China said he was confident of standing upon the
podium at the snooker competition in the 13th Asian Games.
</P>
<P>
With his silver-medal performance in his professional debut at
the British Grand Prix in October, Fu vowed on Thursday to put up
his best performance in the Bangkok Games to award Hong Kong,
China a gold medal.
</P>
<P>
Fu is tipped as one of the best hopefuls for a gold medal for
Hong Kong, China, that has not won any gold medal at the Asian
Games ever since its bowling victory in the 1988 Seoul Games.
</P>
<P>
The 20-year-old Fu finished runner-up after losing 9-2 to world
number nine Stephen Lee in the title clash at the Preston event
where he became the first ever Asian player to reach the final.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Fu attained the feat of becoming the world's first
ever player to win both the Amateur World Championships and
under-21 Youth World Championships in a same year.
</P>
<P>
Fu said he does not see any particular player as his major
opponent but admitted local hero 15th-ranked James Wattana, Sam
Chong of Malaysia and Shaukat Ali of Pakistan may pose threats in
his voyage along the Asian Games.
</P>
<P>
Joining in Hong Kong's Olympic champion woman windsurfer Lee
Lai Shan and star cyclist Wong Kam bo as medal hopefuls, Fu will
compete in three events of the singles, the doubles and the team
competitions in the Bangkok Games, and he was confident of winning
a medal especially from the singles.
</P>
<P>
Fu began his touch of the game at the age of eight, with the
help of one of his father's friends.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the Hong Kong Billiard and Snooker Council said that
to further promote the sport, they would propose to set up a
systematic coaching system for up-and-coming players with a
qualified coach probably from overseas.

<P>
BANGKOK, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's Prime Minister
Chuan Leekpai has expressed concern over Bangkok's traffic
during the 13th Asian Games which open on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"I'm afraid that there may be congestion on the roads during
the opening and closing days, though it is likely to be less so
during the other days of the Games," Leekpai said.
</P>
<P>
"I suggest that the people stay home and watch the opening
ceremony on TV. But for those who will go to the stadium, the
shuttle buses provided in the Park and Ride program would be a
better choice than driving their own cars," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister said the Cabinet will take a ride in a
car-pool awaiting at Government House in order to save parking
space.
</P>
<P>
Bangkok has taken extraordinary measures to ease congestion
during the two-week Games. New highways link the main venues,
schools will be closed to keep parents off the roads,
traffic-choking roadworks will be closed and thousands of
traffic police are being deployed.

<HEADLINE> Logging Endangers Butterfly Habitat in Mexico </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Mexican environmentalists
warned Thursday that illegal logging and construction of a
recreation park in the "sanctuaries" of the monarch butterfly
could cause the mass destruction of the species.
</P>
<P>
Mexican poet Homero Aridjis, president of One Hundred Group of
environmentalists, said his organization had called on the federal
government to act against the development and on the local
authorities to respect the ecological site.
</P>
<P>
Aridjis warned that freezing temperatures this week in the
Michoacan forests could kill the butterfly colonies, as happened
in 1992 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
Some 20 million butterflies died in 1992 and 1995 because of
freezing weather made more acute by the felling of pines in the
months preceding the arrival of the insects.
</P>
<P>
Officials estimated that during the 1980s, 50 percent of the
region was covered in pine forest, but that has shrunk to just 25
percent in some areas.
</P>
<P>
Aridjis, also president of Pen International, a group of
intellectuals from around the world, said the butterfly
sanctuaries were also being threatened by a tourist project.
</P>
<P>
Millions of monarch butterflies fly 3,000 kilometers non-stop
from the south of Canada in a 25-day to escape the northern winter.
</P>
<P>
The Mexican government has declared five forest regions of
Michoacan and one in the state of Mexico as sanctuaries -- places
that are an ecological reservation where the butterflies reproduce.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that from 100 million to 140 million insects
will arrive in Mexico and many will die during hibernation, while
50 percent will be mutilated or attacked by natural predators.

COLOMBO, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Puttalam Cement
Ltd., the country's largest cement factory, has launched its
biggest expansion program costing 22 million U.S. dollars to meet
the growing demand for cement, the official Daily News said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The program will increase production to one million tons from
the current 450,000 tons and will be completed in 1999, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The expansion is expected to serve the company well since the
construction industry is to post higher growth next year following
a host of incentives offered by the government through the 1999
budget, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The company's Managing Director Manilal Fernando told the paper
that already 15 million dollars had been spent so far on the
expansion program.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, a cooler tower to minimize pollution and a
state-of-the-art vertical mill replacing a roller mill will be set
up, said the report, adding that a modern crab crane has also been
installed at a cost of 900,000 dollars.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Initiates Special Training for Housemaids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, December 4 (Xinhua) -- A special housekeeping training
program for Sri Lankan housemaids seeking employment abroad has
been initiated by the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment
(SLBFE), the SLBFE disclosed Friday.
</P>
<P>
Under this program all Sri Lankan housemaids seeking foreign
employment will have to undergo this special training course at 15
centers established islandwide, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The program is expected to enable housemaids to acquire a
knowledge of problems faced by women while being employed abroad
in addition to expanding their knowledge of housekeeping and the
use of sophisticated household items.
</P>
<P>
Additionally it will help housemaids to find solutions to their
 family problems faced by dependents when they are employed
abroad.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the SLBFE noted that Sri Lanka's earnings from
private remittances have exceeded 637 million U.S. dollars during
the first eight months of 1998 in comparison to 563 dollars during
the same period the previous year.
</P>
<P>
It added that there has been an increasing demand for Sri
Lankan skilled labor especially in the Middle East where there is
an influx of housemaids and domestic laborers from Asian
countries.

<HEADLINE> Panama Presidential Candidate Hopes for Good Ties with U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Presidential candidate of
Panama's ruling Democratic Revolutionary Party Martin Torrijos
said Thursday that Panama-U.S. relations will remain strong in the
next millennium as the two countries tackle common issues.
</P>
<P>
"Relations with the United States are hugely important because
both nations share common interests and joint responsibilities
through a neutrality treaty," said Torrijos.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking at a press conference announcing that his
electoral campaign will start in February next year, three months
before the May 2 general election.
</P>
<P>
Torrijos is the son of the late Panamanian leader Omar
Torrijos, who negotiated the 1977 Torrijos-Carter Panama Canal
treaties under which Panama will regain sovereignty of the canal
on December 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Torrijos said the U.S. will continue to be one of the biggest
users of the canal, after its return to the Panamanian sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
"We have the desire and the potential to increase the trade
between the two nations, especially with those states whose
economy depends on the transit of their products through the
Panama Canal," he said.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized the importance of maintaining the fight against
international drug trafficking and money laundering, although he
did not mention a stalled project to establish in Panama a
multilateral anti-drug center, negotiated by the present
government and the White House.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, a senior U.S. official said at a meeting of
American defence ministers in Colombia that two or three sites
were being considered for the relocation of the U.S. military's
anti-narcotics operations from Howard Air Base in Panama.

<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, December 4 (Xinhua) -- A four-day Thai trade
exhibition, sponsored by the Department of Export Promotion of
the Thai Ministry of Commerce in collaboration with its Myanmar
counterpart, is being held here beginning Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition, held under the Myanmar-Thai economic
cooperation promotion program, was jointly inaugurated by
visiting Thai Deputy Minister of Commerce Pravich Ratanapian and
Myanmar Commerce Minister Major-General Kyaw Than.
</P>
<P>
The first exhibition of Thailand in Myanmar, aimed at
stimulating trade and investment between the two countries,
displays a wide array of products and services of 93 Thai
prominent manufacturers and exporters.
</P>
<P>
The products and services cover automotive parts and
accessories, pharmaceutical products and medical supplies,
construction materials and hardware, cosmetic, electrical products
and parts, fashion goods and textiles, fishery materials, food,
freight forwarding, furniture, hotel and resort, warehouse,
international education, painting supplies, and stationery.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the inaugural ceremony, Kyaw Than said more than
80 percent of Myanmar's external trade remain in Asia and the
country attaches great importance to further developing and
strengthening trade relations with Asian countries in general, and
with five neighbors in particular -- Bangladesh, China, India,
Laos and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
On the Myanmar-Thai border, Myanmar has opened three trade
points at Tachilek-Maesai, Myawaddy-Maesod and Kawtoung-Ranong
with one more trade point, the Phaya Thonzu, to be added soon, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that Myanmar, which has large stores of natural
resources and 16.5 million active labor force, has brought about a
total volume of foreign investment exceeding 7.8 billion U.S.
dollars up to now with Thailand as the third largest investor next
to Singapore and Britain.
</P>
<P>
The Thai investment covers sectors of oil and gas, hotels and
tourism, livestock breeding and fishery, industrial estate and
transport.
</P>
<P>
According to Myanmar official statistics, bilateral trade
including border trade stood at 330 million U.S. dollars in the
1997-98 fiscal year which ended in March, up from 289 million
dollars in 1996-97. The balance of trade was in Thailand's favor.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's corporate sector
owes foreign creditors 41.7 billion U.S. dollars, Deputy Prime
Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi said.
</P>
<P>
Supachai, also Commerce Minister, said in remarks published by
Friday's Bangkok Post that he was confident 11 bills supporting
financial and economic reform would be passed by parliament before
the end of the first quarter of next year.
</P>
<P>
He said the bills, particularly those covering foreign
business, bankruptcy and foreclosures, would be crucial to the
country's recovery from last year's economic collapse.
</P>
<P>
He promised new foreclosure and bankruptcy rules would be
passed by March.
</P>
<P>
Total Thai corporate debt stands at up to 7 trillion baht (194
billion dollars), of which 1.5 trillion baht (41.7 billion
dollars) was owed to foreigners, Supachai said, adding that this
underscored the need for changing the old bills to support
financial and economic reform.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda said the government was
willing to change some details of the bills to get them passed
quickly.
</P>
<P>
"If the passage of the bills is approved by the first quarter
of next year, it would be good for the overall economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
Banthoon Lamsam, president of Thai Farmers Bank, said failure
to pass the new legislation would be "disastrous" for the country.
</P>
<P>
"The fate of the economy and the financial system depends on
the passage of these bills," he said.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Chileans' Daily Life Not Affected by Pinochet Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Most Chileans think that the
case of their former leader Augusto Pinochet has not affected
everyday life and oppose boycott of British or Spanish goods over
Pinochet's detention, a poll indicated.
</P>
<P>
The poll, published in Thursday's press, was conducted by
Britain-based Market Opinion Research International in 29 Chilean
cities, where 67 percent of the country's population lives.
</P>
<P>
An executive of the corporation said she was amazed at the
result of the poll, as the Pinochet case had aroused shocks in the
Chilean official circles.
</P>
<P>
Of the 1,190 respondents, who are above the age of 18, some 71
percent said the case had no impact on their life while 82 percent
were against a boycott of goods from Britain, where Pinochet was
detained, or from Spain, where judiciary has demanded Pinochet's
extradition.
</P>
<P>
Six percent said they were "pleased" with Pinochet's arrest in
London on October 16, five percent felt "regretful" and two
percent "enraged."
</P>
<P>
Only six percent were worried that a military coup might be
triggered by the case and three percent feared that the economy
might be affected. Some 66 percent believed that Chile's
democracy process would not be threatened by the case.
</P>
<P>
The pros tied the cons on the question whether it was proper
for the British authorities to arrest Pinochet, while 63 percent
said Pinochet should take responsibility for his alleged serious
crimes, and 57 percent thought he should face trial.
</P>
<P>
The poll closed on November 24, the day before the highest
court of Britain ruled that Pinochet did not enjoy immunity from
prosecution.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 4 (Xinhua) -- India's exports fell sharply
in October this year, registering a decline of 11.63 percent over
the same period last year, official sources said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Exports in October 1998 stood at 2.59 billion U.S. dollars,
lower than the 2.94 billion dollars recorded in October 1997.
</P>
<P>
At an aggregate level, exports in April-October this year are
estimated at 18.87 billion dollars, 5.08 percent lower than 19.88
billion in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Imports in October this year, however, registered an increase
of 8.06 percent to 2.37 billion dollars over 3.12 billion dollars
in October 1997. Trade deficit for April-October is estimated at
5.79 billion dollars, which is higher than 2.67 billion dollars in
the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The abysmal export growth is primarily due to a negative growth
of exports in cotton yarn fabrics, ready-made garments,
engineering goods, basic chemicals and hardware electronics goods.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Asks Advice on Fate of Israeli Spy Pollard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
has asked senior officials to offer recommendations by January 11
on whether convicted Israeli spy Jonathan Pollard should be
granted clemency, a White House official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The president will make his decision "in a timely manner" after
receiving the recommendations, National Security Council spokesman
David Leavy said.
</P>
<P>
Pollard's release was sought by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu as a last-minute condition in the Mideast peace
agreement at Wye River Plantation on Maryland's Eastern Shore in
October.
</P>
<P>
The issue threw the talks off track until Clinton promised to
take a fresh look at clemency for Pollard.
</P>
<P>
Leavy said Clinton "never made a determination to release Mr.
Pollard. He consulted with his advisers at Wye, came to the
conclusion this was not something he was prepared to do at Wye and
he made his own decision to take a fresh look at this case and to
consult all the appropriate agencies."
</P>
<P>
The extraordinary handling of the case reflects its highly
charged political sensitivity. "It's fair to say that other
clemency cases to not raise the same questions as the case of Mr.
Pollard," Leavy said.
</P>
<P>
Pollard, an former U.S. naval intelligence officer, is serving
a life sentence for handing over thousands of top-secret U.S.
documents to Israel in 1984 and 1985.
</P>
<P>
White House counsel Charles F.C. Ruff, acting on Clinton's
behalf, sent letters Nov. 16 to Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, Defense Secretary William Cohen, CIA Director George
Tenet and Attorney General Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
The letters asked for any information that might bear on
Clinton's consideration of clemency for Pollard along with any
recommendations they might wish to make, Leavy said.
</P>
<P>
The letter further requested that all relevant agencies,
including the FBI, Defense Intelligence Agency and National
Security Agency, be included in the process.
</P>
<P>
At the Wye Plantation talks, Tenet vehemently opposed Pollard's
release and told Clinton it would be impossible for him to
continue as director if the convicted spy were freed, according to
a Clinton administration official.

<HEADLINE> Red Cross Calls for Universal Ratification of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The International Committee of
the Red Cross (ICRC) has urged all states to sign and/or ratify
without delay the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use,
Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and
on their Destruction if they have not yet done so.
</P>
<P>
The convention, known as Ottawa treaty, was signed by 123
states in Ottawa, Canada a year ago and the number of
ratifications (40) needed to bring the treaty into force was
reached on September 16, 1998, a record time for an arms-related
treaty.
</P>
<P>
While welcoming the speed at which the Ottawa treaty has been
ratified, ICRC President Cornelio Sommaruga stressed here Thursday
that "landmines pay no attention to treaties".
</P>
<P>
"It is only when states fulfil their obligation to clear mines,
destroy stockpiles and assist victims that the treaty will begin
to save lives," said Sommaruga, adding that the real challenge was
to mobilize the resources needed to implement the Ottawa treaty at
national and international levels.
</P>
<P>
"The tragic lesson to be drawn from the recent floods in
Central America is that mines can go on many years after they
have been laid," said the ICRC president. "They can also travel to
areas many kilometers away. Every day counts."
</P>
<P>
A total of 131 states have now signed the treaty and 55 have
ratified it. The treaty will enter into force on March 1, 1999 for
the 40 states that ratified it by September 16, 1998. It takes six
months for a country which ratifies the treaty to implement it.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 3 (Xinhua) -- France Thursday decided to lower
its key banking interest rate, the tenders rate, from 3.3 percent
to 3.0 percent, in expectation of slower growth in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The French central bank, Banque de France, said that the
decision was made in concertation with other European central
banks and is aimed at keeping the confidence of households and
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Another key interest rate, the short-term borrowing rate, is
kept unchanged at 4.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The president of the board of management of Banque de France,
Jean-Claude Trichet, said that the international environment
remains uncertain and a certain slowdown in the growth is expected
in the whole euro zone in 1999.
</P>
<P>
But he said that the stability of the French franc and the
European single currency euro will be ensured.
</P>
<P>
The French Minister of Finance and Economy Dominique
Strauss-Kahn said on Wednesday for the first time that the French
economy is not on the ``slope'' of 2.7 percent as is previously
expected for 1999.
</P>
<P>
The exchange rate of the French franc with the U.S. dollar has
remained over-valued for months at around one dollar for 5.7
francs.
</P>
<P>
The single currency will be formally launched one month later
by 11 countries of the European Union.

<HEADLINE> EU Rejects U.S. Proposal Over Banana Regime Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)
rejected on Thursday the United States' demand to change the EU's
banana regime.
</P>
<P>
The EU said it wishes to resume discussions to bridge the
differences once the EU and the U.S. have "agreed on a mutually
acceptable dispute settlement procedure."
</P>
<P>
In response to a letter from U.S. Trade Representative Charlene
Barshefsky, European Commission Vice-President Leon Brittan said
the United States apparently wants to break off negotiations and
resort to actions which may lead to a major trade dispute between
the EU and the United States and damage the World Trade
Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
He said he felt disappointed when he received the letter this
morning and knew the EU and the United States would not be able to
reach an agreement on a timetable for an accelerated WTO panel on
the EU banana regime.
</P>
<P>
Brittan said in his letter to Barshefsky that the EU does not
think it would make sense for the United States to take
retaliatory actions against the EU because its proposal provides
the United States with the opportunity to obtain a definitive,
independent resolution on a dispute that has been running for some
years.
</P>
<P>
The dispute might be settled in a few weeks after March 3,
1999, the deadline the United States set for resorting to
retaliatory actions.
</P>
<P>
However, the vice president said the EU "remains ready to
continue the discussions" if the United States would give its
decision a second thought.

<HEADLINE> Former Ukrainian PM Arrested in Switzerland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine's former prime minister
Pavlo Lazarenko was brought to Geneva Thursday for investigation
after being arrested in the northern Swiss city of Basle when he
entered Switzerland in a car from France Wednesday, according to
the Swiss news agency, ATS.
</P>
<P>
The news agency said that 45-year-old Lazarenko and his aid
were wanted by Ukrainian authorities on suspicion of having
embezzled public money worth 20 million U.S. dollars and deposited
in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
Lazarenko, prime minister from June 1996 to June 1997, is now a
parliamentary deputy and heads the influential Hromada (Community)
left-center movement which strongly opposes President Leonid
Kuchma.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Kiev cited the president of the commission for
foreign affairs as saying that Ukraine is waiting for the
explanations about Lazarenko's arrest from the Swiss authorities.

<HEADLINE> UK's Tory Party in Crisis After Lords Leader Sacked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Britain's opposition
Conservative Party leader William Hague's leadership was in deep
crisis after five Conservative peers resigned on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Deputy leader Lord Fraser and four other Tory peers resigned in
protest against Hague's decision on Wednesday to sack Tory's
leader in the House of Lords Viscount Cranborne.
</P>
<P>
Hague sacked Lord Cranborne after he brokered a deal with the
government - without his leader's authority - to keep 91
hereditary peers during the first phase of House of Lords reform.
The sacking plunged the Tory party into crisis.
</P>
<P>
Opposition frontbench spokesmen Lord Bowness, Lord Pilkington
and the Earl of Home quit their posts hours after Lord Fraser
announced he was standing down. Baroness Strange announced she was
quitting the Tory party for the crossbenches.
</P>
<P>
Even the man chosen to replace Viscount Cranborne, Lord
Strathclyde, revealed he had offered his resignation which had
been rejected by Hague who instead asked him to take over the top
job in the upper House.
</P>
<P>
Lord Fraser said Hague had made a "serious mistake" in sacking
Lord Cranborne and there was widespread speculation in Westminster
that Hague had lost his grip of his own party.
</P>
<P>
The Tory leader hit back, insisting he had the "emphatic
support" of his MPs.
</P>
<P>
"We had a serious problem yesterday and I have dealt with that.
I am going to rebuild my party on the basis of discipline whether
people like that or not," Hague said.
</P>
<P>
Even though most believe he will be able to remain as leader,
if for no other reason than the fact that there is no obvious
alternative candidate, there is little doubt his leadership has
suffered its most serious crisis yet.

<HEADLINE> Disaster '99 Conf Scheduled in Nairobi in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The first East African
Conference on Disaster Management for Businesses is scheduled in
the Kenyan capital in February, 1999, the Nairobi-based Untied
Nations Center for Human Settlements (Habitat) said.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the conference is to bring together
professionals within the business community to share and learn
the lessons from the August 7 Nairobi bombing so that they can be
better prepared, the Habitat said in a press release available
here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Topics to be discussed at the meeting will include
vulnerability analysis, insurance coverage, the implementation of
a business continuity plan, re-establishment of computer and
telecommunications system and protecting logistics lifelines.
</P>
<P>
Being prepared is not only good for businesses but also
benefits all people, Habitat acting Executive Director Klaus
Toepfer said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the business community have a critical role to
play in protecting their employees, customers and their
surrounding neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
International studies indicate that on average only 30 percent
of companies are still in operation within three years of a major
disaster.
</P>
<P>
The Habitat noted the key to survival depends largely upon the
ability to muster an immediate, effective and accurate response.
In short, the businesses cannot afford to be caught unprepared.
</P>
<P>
The conference is to be organized by the Financial Mail with
the support of Habitat and other organizations including Kenya
Airways.

<HEADLINE> African Parliamentarian Seminar Starts in Harare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 3 (Xinhua) -- A two-day African
parliamentarian seminar began in Zimbabwean capital Harare
Thursday to discuss the role and functioning of parliaments in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
At the opening ceremony, Zimbabwean Speaker of Parliament
Cyril Ndebele said that legislators should ensure their
independence by not relying solely on information provided by
lobbyists and agencies of the executive.
</P>
<P>
The speaker said there was an urgent need by African
parliaments to have an independent and comprehensive information
and research service from which the legislature could draw.
</P>
<P>
In most cases, he said, governments had a monopoly of
information which would be biased toward the executive.
</P>
<P>
Ndebele also said that democracy and good governance could not
flourish where decisions of national significance were made
secretly without consulting civil society.
</P>
<P>
He said strengthening legislature in developing countries
should not be seen as competition with the executive but was a
way to enable them to play their constitutional and complementary
roles in governance.
</P>
<P>
The two-day Global Coalition for Africa meeting was being
attended by participants from 21 countries.
</P>
<P>
It would focus on issues relating to competent functioning of
parliaments and development of expertise.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Unemployment Claims Pick Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The number of first-time
applications for unemployment benefits rose last week, the Labor
Department said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Jobless claims increased by 12,000 to a seasonally adjusted
313,000, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
However, it was still below the level of early November. But a
four-week moving average rose by 250 to a seasonally adjusted
319,250.
</P>
<P>
That was the highest level since July, when the General Motors
strikes increased the number of claims. Excluding the GM strike,
the four-week average hit a 10-month high.
</P>
<P>
Due largely to loss of sales abroad, primarily in East Asia,
the U.S. manufacturers had to slash payrolls by nearly 200,000
jobs and the nation's unemployment rate has crept to 4.6 percent
from a 28-year low of 4.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The latest evidence of the negative impact came this week when
Boeing Co., the world's largest aerospace company, announced it
would lay off 20,000 workers, bringing its planned job cuts
announced since the summer to 48,000.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia to Exert Efforts to Boost Coffee Income </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia's Coffee and Tea
Authority said Thursday that it is exerting maximum efforts to
boost the revenue from coffee export.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ethiopian News Agency, Tsegaye Berhane,
General Manager of the authority, told journalists that a slump
in the world coffee price is feared in 1998/99 as a result of
high production of the crop in coffee producing countries like
Brazil.
</P>
<P>
Tsegaye said that a slump in the world price of coffee could
have a domino effect on the price of Ethiopia coffee in the
international auction.
</P>
<P>
Coffee is Ethiopia's most important export commodity and
contributes to about 60 percent of the export income.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopian Minister of Trade and Industry Kasahun Ayele
announced here last month that the income from coffee export
takes a 63.6 percent share of its export planned in 1998/99 (July
8, 1998-July 7, 1999).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tsegaye urged the coffee producers and traders not
to keep the crop in storage for an extended period of time.
</P>
<P>
A sizable quantity of coffee is kept in storage by Ethiopian
farmers and traders, according to the authority.
</P>
<P>
"If coffee is stored for a long time, it will lose its quality
and taste," the general manager said, adding that "this will, in
turn, have a dire consequence on the value of Ethiopian coffee in
the world market."

<HEADLINE> Tanzania's Trade Account Improves: C. Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's trade account
during October improved by 33 percent, reducing deficit by 26.5
million U.S. Dollars over the previous month, the Bank of
Tanzania said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
This improvement was largely due to an increase in export
earnings by 67.2 percent, which more than offset the effect of
1.9 percent increase in import bill, the central bank said in its
latest monthly economic review.
</P>
<P>
The increase in export earnings originated from the
traditional sector whose earnings more than doubled, said the
November issue report.
</P>
<P>
During the year ending October 1998, the trade account
recorded a deficit of 788.3 million Dollars, representing a 28.5
percent increase compared with a deficit of 613.6 million Dollars
recorded during the corresponding period last year, it added.
</P>
<P>
The trade account deficit worsened during the reviewing period
primarily because of a significant decline in export earnings
coupled with an increase of the import bill, it said.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Presidential Ban on Strikes Tabled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean Ministry of Public
Service, Labor and Social Welfare Thursday tabled before
parliament the presidential powers (temporary measures)
regulations meant to ban strikes under the labor regulations.
</P>
<P>
The presidential decree comes at a time when actions by the
labor movement, the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions, are blamed
for inflicting huge damages on the economy.
</P>
<P>
In a parliamentary address regarding the presidential powers
promulgated on November 27 this year, Minister Florence Chitauro
said there were procedural requirements to amend a piece of
legislation and yet there was need to amend the law in order to
protect the economy, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The government, she said, could not wait for the amendment
processes of the labor relations act in order to include strikes
among illegal mass actions.
</P>
<P>
"These stay-aways have damaged the economy and the government
believes that the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions is taking
advantage of the inadequacies in our labor legislation, as the
current labor relations act does not adequately address the issue
of stay-aways," said Chitauro.
</P>
<P>
"The decision to bring on board the issue of stay-away
legislatively through the presidential powers does not mean that
the government had abandoned the much-cherished dialog," said the
minister.
</P>
<P>
"It is merely a measure to govern a collective action which
was omitted and now being resorted by labor organization," she
said, adding that dialog would continue.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Urged Not to Deploy Russian Missiles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. has urged the Cypriot
government not to deploy Russian anti-aircraft missiles on the
island, U.S. Ambassador to Cyprus Kenneth Brill said here Thursday
after his meeting with Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides.
</P>
<P>
"We have always supported the idea of the missiles not
coming to Cyprus. As long as they are not coming to Cyprus,
we are ready to consider almost anything else," the Ambassador
said.
</P>
<P>
And the U.S. supports the ongoing U.N.-sponsored shuttle talks
which Secretary-General Kofi Annan's envoy in Cyprus Dame Ann
Hercus is conducting, he added.
</P>
<P>
Brill said the arrival of the missiles "complicates the process
of getting to the demilitarization of Cyprus," adding that "we
hope that the position we have taken from the beginning that they
should not come to Cyprus is the one that will be adopted by the
government of Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
Asked if the U.N. process would be facilitated if the
missiles do not arrive in Cyprus, Brill said that the U.S.
would not want to see things happen that would detract from
that process.
</P>
<P>
"The arrival of the missiles would detract from that," he
stressed, noting that the ongoing U.N. process is all the
more reason for the U.S. position to be adhered to.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus signed a deal with Russia in January 1997 to buy S-300
anti-aircraft missiles in a bid to booster its defense.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and other western countries have criticized Cyprus
for the deal, and Turkey have threatened to launch pre-emptive
military strikes if the missiles are deployed on the island.
</P>
<P>
Brill said the U.S. initiative to break the current deadlock
in Cyprus runs parallel to that of the U.N. and expressed
strong support to the U.N. process.
</P>
<P>
"Dame Ann has the strongest possible support from the U.S.
government and other members of the U.N. Security Council," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated
south and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since Turkey landed
its troops and took over the northern third of the island in
1974 following a failed pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots declared unilaterally in 1983 a
breakaway "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus," which was
recognized only by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been trying for decades to reunite the
island through a bi-communal formula, but no results have been
achieved.

ADDIS ABABA, December 3 (xinhua) -- Ethiopia Thursday said
that along with the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) it is
looking for donors to fund the 4.5 million U.S. Dollars needed to
dispose obsolete pesticides in the country.
</P>
<P>
Bateno Kabeto, an official from the Ethiopian Ministry of
Agriculture, told a meeting here that there are 1,152 tons of
obsolete pesticides and more than 100 tons of contaminated
equipment and soil in the country.
</P>
<P>
The official said some of these chemicals are over 40 years
old while some have become unrecognized as their labels were lost
or mixed up with a cocktail of different types of pesticides.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the meeting, Alemayehu Wodajeneh, FAO's obsolete
pesticide coordinator, said that Morocco is at the top followed
by Ethiopia and Tanzania in obsolete pesticide stock in Africa.
</P>
<P>
He said that 80 to 100 million Dollars is needed to dispose
expired pesticides in Africa.

<HEADLINE> International Symposium on DU Impacts Concludes in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 3 (Xinhua) -- People who were affected by
depleted uranium (DU) in the 1991 Gulf War should be compensated,
said a statement issued here Thursday at the conclusion of an
international symposium on the use of DU and its impacts on man
and environment.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day meeting, which started on Wednesday,
participants discussed the grave effects of the U.S.-British use
of banned DU shells against Iraq on its coming generations and on
other states in the region.
</P>
<P>
The symposium brought together more than 200 experts and
specialists from the U.S., Britain, Canada, Germany, Jordan,
Tunisia and Iraq, and some U.S. and British veterans who had
participated in the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Two sessions were held Thursday to discuss scientific research
findings on the issue. One research indicates that large
landscapes in southern Iraq have been polluted by DU radiations,
referring to the increase in cancer cases among Iraqi soldiers,
especially the spread of leukemia.
</P>
<P>
Another research shows that barrenness cases have more
than doubled in the Iraqi province of Basrah, and at the
same time, cases of congenital deformities have also doubled,
notably in the southern provinces.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. allegations that the Gulf War was a clean war
were not true, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi troops invaded Kuwait in August 1990, touching off the
1991 Gulf War. During the 43-day war, the U.S. and Britain
dropped some 700-800 tons of DU shells in Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Tietmeyer: Rate-Cutting not under Political Pressure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, December 3 (Xinhua) -- In a concerted action, 11 European
banks were cutting their key interest rates to a nearly-uniform
3.0 per cent on Thursday. But the German Bundesbank's president
Hans Tietmeyer promised at the same day, that was not owing to any
political pressure.
</P>
<P>
The Bundesbank cut its security repurchase offer - an
instrument providing short-term liquidity to banks - to 3.0 per
cent from the 3.30 per cent level which has been unchanged since
October 1997.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, Tietmeyer said the rate cut decision
had been taken after consultations with other 10 central banks as
well as with the European Central Bank (ECB), the institution
which on January 1, 1999 will be guiding the fortunes of the
European Monetary Union and the single currency, the euro.
</P>
<P>
Tietmeyer stressed that the rate cut move of the German
Bundesbank, which took most financial market experts completely by
surprise, was a "sovereign decision of the Bundesbank,
uninfluenced by political expectations".
</P>
<P>
And that, all other 10 central banks lowered their rates, did
not take place due to political pressure, too, he said.
</P>
<P>
Tietmeyer said that after intensive analysis by the ECB and the
Bundesbank, it was determined that a "further coordinated rate
cut is called for in order to guide downward the central banks'
rates at the start of the European Monetary Union to 3.0 per
cent".
</P>
<P>
The German Finance Ministry issued a statement at the same day
welcoming the rate cut, calling the decision one which would
contribute to more growth and employment.

Aurore Martin and Peter Hue-Schmidt were suspected of
murdering, via traffic accidents, their respective spouse in 1992
and then in 1995 so as to claim as much as a combined life
insurance of more than 40 million Belgian francs (1.1 million U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The two were accused of having planned to start a luxurious

The Aurore Martin and Peter Hue-Schmidt team reportedly made
the most of the loopholes of American legislation to set back
their extradition back to Belgium.

<HEADLINE> Annan to Meet Libyan Leader on Lockerbie Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 3 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan will meet with Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi on
Saturday to discuss the 1988 Lockerbie airliner bombing, a U.N.
spokesman said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. spokesman, Manoel de Almeida e Silva told a press
conference that Annan revealed the planned visit on Thursday after
meeting with Tunisian Foreign Minister Said Ben Mustapha in Tunis,
capital of Tunisia.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman quoted the U.N. chief as saying at a news
conference in Tunis, "Yes, I will go to Libya on Saturday. We are
going to look at solutions to the problem." Asked if he would meet
Gaddafi, Annan replied, "Yes, I believe so."
</P>
<P>
"Of course, he (Annan) was to help improve and find good
results and solve an impasse," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Annan on Wednesday asked a Security Council sanctions committee
for permission to break a U.N. air embargo and fly either to
Tripoli, the Libyan capital, or Sirte, a coastal city some 450
kilometers east of Triopli, U.N. sources said. The spokesman also
confirmed that Annan has got permission from the committee to go
ahead with his flight into Libya.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.N. spokesman, asked about where Annan would meet
with Gaddafi, told reporters that "the details of the trip at this
point must be kept confidential at least a while longer."
</P>
<P>
Libyan lawyers and the U.N. legal team, which spent several
weeks in New York, have discussed the matters on the surrender of
the two suspects in the Lockerbie bombing, which took place nearly
10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Libya has agreed to put the two suspects, namely Abdel Basset
Ali Mohammed al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah, on trial in the
Netherlands before a Scottish court. But Tripoli has objected to
British and U.S. demands that they serve their sentences in
Scotland if convicted.
</P>
<P>
The two Libyans have been accused by the United States and
Britain of planting a bomb aboard Pan Am Flight 303 which
exploded over the Scottish village of Lockerbie in December
1988, killing 270 people.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Commerce Secretary Calls for Improved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Commerce Secretary
William Daley ended a one-day visit here Thursday with strong
call for improved trade and investment environment in Africa
which will expand U.S.-African economic relationship.
</P>
<P>
"Your economic house must be in order. Companies look at the
fundamentals of government policies... and I encourage all of you
to help promote a more transparent, open, better environment for
doing business," he told economic leaders from Uganda, Tanzania
and Kenya at a luncheon here.
</P>
<P>
He urged the continent to make more efforts to "build on the
progress to date in privatizing and cutting trade barriers," to
maintain political stability, improve infrastructure and legal
structure, as well as promote regional trade.
</P>
<P>
"For Africa to be on a global stage, it cannot be small
disconnected markets. It must be regional markets... But today,
only 13 percent of African trade is with other African
countries," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Later at a press conference, he said that he is optismistic
about the prospect of the two-way trade between Africa and
America especially as the Clinton administration may push the
African Growth and Opportunity Act through Congress next year.
</P>
<P>
"I am optimistic that the African Growth and Opportunity Act
will go through, and I believe... that it will go through next
year," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The bill to promote trade and investment in Africa was passed
by the U.N. House of Representatives in March, but got stalled
before the Senate Finance Committee in July after a series of
amendments were attached to it.
</P>
<P>
Daley's visit, the second to Kenya and the third to Africa
this year, is widely seen as a clear signal that the U.S. is
trying hard to re-focus its relationship with the poorest
continent from politics to economy.
</P>
<P>
Daley, who flies to Cote d'Ivoire on Thursday evening, was
accompanied by a 15-strong delegation of American corporate
executives including those from AT&AMP;T, Chevron, Dupont, Cargill,
Kodak and Pfizer.
</P>
<P>
Four commercial cooperation agreements were signed Thursday
between the U.S. companies and the Kenyan side on agricultural
research, investment fund, industrial standard and aviation.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Export-Import Bank signed an accord on financing
Kenya Airways Ltd. to purchase a Boeing 737-300 aircraft from
America.
</P>
<P>
Data from the Kenyan Trade Ministry show that in 1997, Kenya
imported 705.49 million Shillings (around 102 million U.S.
Dollars) of U.S. goods and and exported goods worth of 170.07
million Shillings (some 28.3 million Dollars) to the United
States.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia to Exert Efforts to Boost Coffee Income </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia's Coffee and Tea
Authority said Thursday that it is exerting maximum efforts to
boost the revenue from coffee export.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ethiopian News Agency, Tsegaye Berhane,
General Manager of the authority, told journalists that a slump
in the world coffee price is feared in 1998/99 as a result of
high production of the crop in coffee producing countries like
Brazil.
</P>
<P>
Tsegaye said that a slump in the world price of coffee could
have a domino effect on the price of Ethiopia coffee in the
international auction.
</P>
<P>
Coffee is Ethiopia's most important export commodity and
contributes to about 60 percent of the export income.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopian Minister of Trade and Industry Kasahun Ayele
announced here last month that the income from coffee export
takes a 63.6 percent share of its export planned in 1998/99 (July
8, 1998-July 7, 1999).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tsegaye urged the coffee producers and traders not
to keep the crop in storage for an extended period of time.
</P>
<P>
A sizable quantity of coffee is kept in storage by Ethiopian
farmers and traders, according to the authority.
</P>
<P>
"If coffee is stored for a long time, it will lose its quality
and taste," the general manager said, adding that "this will, in
turn, have a dire consequence on the value of Ethiopian coffee in
the world market."

<HEADLINE> Tanzania's Trade Account Improves: C. Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's trade account
during October improved by 33 percent, reducing deficit by 26.5
million U.S. Dollars over the previous month, the Bank of
Tanzania said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
This improvement was largely due to an increase in export
earnings by 67.2 percent, which more than offset the effect of
1.9 percent increase in import bill, the central bank said in its
latest monthly economic review.
</P>
<P>
The increase in export earnings originated from the
traditional sector whose earnings more than doubled, said the
November issue report.
</P>
<P>
During the year ending October 1998, the trade account
recorded a deficit of 788.3 million Dollars, representing a 28.5
percent increase compared with a deficit of 613.6 million Dollars
recorded during the corresponding period last year, it added.
</P>
<P>
The trade account deficit worsened during the reviewing period
primarily because of a significant decline in export earnings
coupled with an increase of the import bill, it said.

<P>
LONDON, December 3 (Xinhua) - The London International
Financial Futures and Options Exchange (LIFFE) traded 11,980,834
futures and options contracts during November 1998.
</P>
<P>
Average daily volume amounted to 570,516 contracts,
representing an average daily nominal turnover of 182 billion
pounds (291.2 billion US dollars), the LIFFE announced here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
During the year to date, January to the end of November,
LIFFE's cumulative volume totalled 184,423,442 contracts, 6
percent down on the same period last year, it added.
</P>
<P>
Open interest, a good indicator of liquidity and long term use
of the market, totalled 9,044,135 contracts on 30 november, an
increase of 22 percent from the same time last year.
</P>
<P>
Hugh Freedberg, LIFFE's Chief Executive, said "LIFFE's November
volumes reflected quiet underlying cash markets due to lower
volatility, ahead of the introduction of Economic and Mometary
Union."
</P>
<P>
However, with the introduction of a Three Month Euro Euribor
futures contract on 8 December, LIFFE will be offering the market
a complete range of euro-denominated money market contracts in the
run-up to EMU and beyond, Freedberg added.

<HEADLINE> Retail Confidence Falls in Britain at Record Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 3 (Xinhua) - Confidence in high street sales
among British retailers is falling at its fastest rate since
records began 15 years ago, according to a survey by The
Confederation of British Industry (CBI).
</P>
<P>
Sales volumes were down, with only 36 percent of shops
reporting an increase compared with the same time last year and 45
percent experiencing a dip.
</P>
<P>
The CBI found that falling sales in November took retailers by
surprise and led them drastically to cut their expectations.
</P>
<P>
It said the survey underlined the need for a further cut in
interest rates at the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee
meeting next week.
</P>
<P>
Sudhir Junankar, the CBI's associate director of economic
analysis, said the results "underlined the message from other
data, that demand at home is softening, supporting the need for a
0.5 percent cut in interest rates next week."
</P>
<P>
The survey came on the day that another poll found the service
sector as a whole had contracted for the first time in at least
two years.
</P>
<P>
The November Chartered Institute of Purchasing Managers' report
found business activity decreased for the first time since the
survey began in July 1996.

</P>
<P>
Last week, about 7,000 students did a similar march in which
six cars were set alight and two bank windows smashed.
</P>
<P>
Currently, more than 300 high schools around Greece are under
occupation by students, with university students threatening to
follow suit.

<HEADLINE> Britain Denies Paying for Charges against Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The British embassy in Cairo on
Thursday denied that it was channeling money to an Egyptian human
rights group for a report on alleged religious persecution in the
country.
</P>
<P>
An embassy spokesman said the claim that the money sent to the
Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) was payment for its
report on Egyptian police torture of Christian Copts in the south
was wrong.
</P>
<P>
That the embassy relaying a check of 25,703 U.S. dollars
offered by the British Foreign Office to EOHR "has nothing to do
with" that report, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
According to Egypt's Middle East News Agency, the spokesman
said that Britain has contributed to EOHR during the past two
years, including the latest sum, and the funds were intended to
help finance an EOHR program to provide legal aid for Egyptian
women.
</P>
<P>
The British embassy's denial came after the Al Usbou weekly
newspaper maintained that the check that EOHR recently received
from the embassy was behind its report.
</P>
<P>
The private-owned weekly denounced EOHR's acceptance of the
money as treason, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
EOHR, founded in 1985, decided a week ago to send back the
check to the British embassy.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Gazette newspaper has reported that EOHR released
a report in September claiming that more than 1,000 Copts were
rounded up by police at Kosheh village in southern Suhag
Governorate.
</P>
<P>
Based on the allegation, Britain's Sunday Telegraph newspaper
said: "Egyptian Christians have been subjected to horrific
crucification rituals, raped and tortured by the security forces
during a crackdown on the ancient Coptic community."
</P>
<P>
Egypt's parliament, social groups and celebrities have
denounced the story in the British newspaper as a fabrication
aimed at defaming Egypt.
</P>
<P>
They said Muslim majority and Christian minority have been
peacefully co-existing for more than 14 centuries.

<HEADLINE> Somali Rival Warlords Back From Soliciting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of Somalis with
green leaves, placards, flags, guns and battle wagons Thursday
headed toward the dusty airstrips of Jasira and Km-50 to receive
the two rival Somali warlords, Hussein Mohamed Aidid and Osman
Ali Atto.
</P>
<P>
More than 50 battle wagons and senior officials from the
disputed administration of Mogadishu welcomed Hussein Mohamed
Aidid at Km-50 after he has been out of Somalia for nearly four
months.
</P>
<P>
Hussein Aidid did not speak to the people over his journey.
However, it is known that he went out to normalize his relation
with the government of Ethiopia and to seek moral and material
support for the administration he created with his former arch
rival Ali Mahdi Mohamed in early August this year.
</P>
<P>
Hussein Aidid has visited Addis Ababa of Ethiopia, Yemen,
Egypt and Libya where he met the leaders of the countries over
the possible ways they could assist the administration of
Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
More than 800,000 U.S. Dollars in cash, medicines and police
uniforms have already reached the capital in his absence as the
first signs of moral support from those countries.
</P>
<P>
Despite all these donations and the demobilization of three
thousand militiamen, the security situation in Mogadishu still
remains far from stable.
</P>
<P>
Likewise, faction leader Osman Ali Atto has landed from the
dusty and narrow airstrip of Jasira, 7 km south of the capital.
</P>
<P>
Osman Ali Atto left Mogadishu a few days after the
establishment of Mogadishu's administration which he rejected its
legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
Osman Atto, together with other political opponents of
Mogadishu's administration, have been lobbying for blocking any
political recognition or material support for Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
The arrival of the two warlords in Mogadishu Thursday is not a
mere coincidence, but a tactful act in which both men are
preparing to meet the international delegation currently visiting
Somalia for the assessment of a possible reconciliation and
reconstruction for Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The delegation which is due to arrive in Mogadishu in two
or three days is not likely to be smooth going in their attempts
to meet the political rivals, business rivals, religious rivals,
rival traditional elders as well as rival Islamic courts.
</P>
<P>
The forthcoming delegation has already affected Mogadishu
where the value of international currencies are decreasing
considerably.
</P>
<P>
The administration of Somaliland has already met the
delegation while others like Puntland, Mogadishu and Hiran are on
the schedule to meet them, with political rivals also looking
forward to the meeting with the aim of telling them their own
views and efforts in reconciling and rebuilding a better Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Politicians foresee that those groups will in the end manage
to confuse the delegation, since each group is pretending to be
the largest and most significant, and a solution for Somalia's
crises will remain as difficult as ever unless a strong decision
is taken by the international community toward the formation of a
central administration for Somalia if it will ever come into
existence in the near future.

<HEADLINE> U.N. General Assembly Asked to Debate Cyprus Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus has officially informed
the United Nations that it would request a debate on the Cyprus
issue at the General Assembly in 1999, government spokesman
Christos Stylianides said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus' permanent representative to the U.N., Sotos Zackheos,
has told General Assembly President Didier Opertti on Wednesday of
the decision, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made by Cyprus's National Council, the top
advisory body to the president, he added.
</P>
<P>
U.N. secretary-general's envoy in Cyprus, Ann Hercus, began
separate meetings with Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots in
October to ease the tensions on the island, Stylianides said.
</P>
<P>
The protracted Cyprus problem was frequently discussed by the
U.N. Security Council, but has not been the subject of a General
Assembly debate since 1983.
</P>
<P>
Peace efforts have come to a standstill since the summer of
1997, when Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash demanded
international recognition of his breakaway state in northern
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
He also demanded that Cyprus withdraw its application to join
the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated
south and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since Turkey landed
its troops and took over the northern third of the island in 1974
following a failed pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots declared unilaterally in 1983 a "Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus," which was recognized only by
Turkey.

LAGOS, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Liberian President Charles
Taylor has proposed a balanced 1999 budget to parliament,
with spending up by 55 percent over 1998, a report reaching here
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The draft budget, proposed to the Liberian parliament Wednesday,
projected spending of 2.6 billion Liberian Dollars, or 64 million
U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Taylor said the government would cover spending from revenue
without foreign help. "This shows that we have improved a little
bit over our revenue collection," he said.
</P>
<P>
He proposed the creation of a budget allotment committee to
ensure the funds are used for what they are intended.
</P>
<P>
Taylor said there would be no tax increase but efforts would
be made to improve the collection of existing taxes.
</P>
<P>
He also announced the cuts in official visits abroad and in
the number of Liberian embassies.
</P>
<P>
The embassy in South Africa will be responsible for southern
Africa, while Europe will be covered by an ambassador to the

<HEADLINE> Ugandan President Calls for End to Circumcision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni has urged Sabiny people in eastern districts to change
the culture of circumcising women and to appreciate that the
practice is dangerous medically and creates numerous health
problems for women.
</P>
<P>
A press release from the President's Office said Museveni made
the appeal Thursday when addressing a public rally during his
one-day visit to the Kapchorwa district which coincided with the
celebrations to mark the district's Culture Day.
</P>
<P>
Culture, like all living things, has to grow and change if it
is to remain healthy and that his government has approached the
issue of women circumcision through education, sensitization and
dialog rather than legislation, he said.
</P>
<P>
He thanked Sabiny elders and organizations such as the United
Nations Fund for Population Activities for helping the government
in the campaign against female circumcision.
</P>
<P>
Female circumcision in the Sabiny tribe, which has been
observed for centuries, is considered by local people as a sign
of reaching womanhood. The fight against this old tradition won
a U.N. prize for the Sabiny leader recently.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Export Earnings Rise by 67.1 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's total export
earnings during October increased by 67.1 percent to 71.9 million
U.S. Dollars, compared with 43 million U.S. Dollars recorded
during the previous month, the central bank said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A monthly economic review report by the Bank of Tanzania (BoT)
largely attributed the rise to a significant increase in earnings
from traditional exports.
</P>
<P>
Earnings from traditional exports increased by 184.2 percent
to 42 million Dollars in October, compared with 14.8 million
Dollars recorded in the previous month, the November issue report
said.
</P>
<P>
Increases in both prices and volumes explain the improvement,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
Except for cotton and sisal, whose volumes declined by 13.3
percent and 21.4 percent respectively, all other traditional
exports, namely coffee, tea, tobacco and cashewnut recorded
significant increases in export volumes, the report said, adding
that all crops recorded unit price increases during the period
under review.
</P>
<P>
In the same period, it said, earnings from non-traditional
exports increased by 5.9 percent to 29.9 million U.S. Dollars
from 28.3 million U.S. Dollars in the previous month.
</P>
<P>
There was an increase in export earnings from petroleum
products, manufactured tobacco, fish and fish products,
horticultural produce and other exports, while all other
non-traditional exports, namely minerals, manufactured goods,
cotton yarn, manufactured coffee and sisal products recorded
declines in export earnings.
</P>
<P>
However, earnings from traditional exports decreased to 329.6
million U.S. Dollars, from 377.6 million recorded during the same
period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the country's total imports in October increased by
two percent to 125.7 million U.S. Dollars, from 123.3 million
U.S. Dollars recorded during the previous month.

<HEADLINE> Canada Seeks Consultations on European Union </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Canadian International Trade
Minister Sergio Marchi announced Thursday that Canada has
requested World Trade Organization (WTO) consultations on European
Union(EU) patent measures on pharmaceutical and agricultural
chemical products.
</P>
<P>
The measures at issue relate to the EU supplementary protection
certificate (SPC), which extends patent protection beyond the
minimum 20 years as required in the Agreement on Trade-related
Aspects of Intelectual Property Rights(TRIPS).
</P>
<P>
Canada argues that the SPC is discriminatory and contrary to
the EU's WTO obligations, since it applies only to pharmaceutical
and agricultural chemical products.
</P>
<P>
"Canada has no objection to other countries offering greater
protection than the minimum required by the TRIPS Agreement," said
Minister Marchi in a release. "However, the discriminatory nature
of the EU regime contravenes its WTO obligations."
</P>
<P>
The international trade system allows a balance between the
interests of innovator companies in having a healthy and
profitable investment climate and the global objective of ensuring
that low-cost medicines are available as soon as possible after
patent expiry, said the release.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Cuba Begin Migration Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The United States said
Thursday that U.S. and Cuban officials will meet Friday in Havana
for another in a series of discussions on migration issues.
</P>
<P>
The talks are aimed at ensuring continued smooth operation of
migration agreements between the two countries, said State
Department spokesman James Foley.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the talks, the 10th in the current
series, will deal exclusively with migration issues. The U.S.
delegation will be led by John Hamilton, a deputy assistant
secretary
</P>
<P>
Since 1995, the U.S. Coast Guard has been returning to the
island Cuban boat people who attempt to flee to the United States.
Cuba has promised not to punish those who are returned.
</P>
<P>
A recurring U.S. complaint is that the departure fees Cuba
charges to legal emigrants are excessive. A bilateral agreement
requires the United States to grant residence visas to 20,000
Cubans each year.
</P>
<P>
Another U.S. concern is Cuba's unwillingness to allow the
return of some of the Cubans who arrived in the United States in
the 1980 Mariel boat-lift.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Hopes Annan Can Help Solve Lockerbie Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Egypt hoped that U.N. Secretary
General Kofi Annan's upcoming visit to Libya would help seek a
solution to the Lockerbie issue.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said all parties concerned
have the desire to end the standoff between Libya, on the one
hand, and the United States and Britain, on the other, Egypt's
Middle East News Agency reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said Egypt hopes that the problem could be settled to
the satisfaction of both sides.
</P>
<P>
Annan is scheduled to arrive in Tripoli, capital of Libya on
Saturday to help solve the Lockerbie issue in which 270 people
were killed..
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain demanded that Libya surrender two of its
citizens suspected of blowing up the Pan Am 103 flight over
Lockerbie, Scotland in 1988.
</P>
<P>
For years, Washington and London insisted that the two suspects
be tried either in the U.S. or Scotland. Fearing that its citizens
will not get a fair trial, Libya refused to hand over the
suspects, demanding that they be tried in a neutral country.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain succeeded in pressing the U.N. Security
Council to impose an air and arms embargo on Libya in 1992 for its
refusal to extradite the suspects.
</P>
<P>
A compromise has been reached lately that the Libyan suspects
be tried in the Hague, the Netherlands by Scottish judges
according to Scottish law.
</P>
<P>
Libya, meanwhile, seeks guarantee that the suspects will not be
extradited to the U.S. and wants them to be imprisoned in Libya if
convicted of guilty.

<HEADLINE> Holocaust Conference Adopts Guidelines for Nazi Art </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 3 (Xinhua) -- An international conference
agreed Thursday that arts confiscated from Jews by Nazi Germany,
including Picassos and Cezannes, could be returned to prewar
owners or their heirs or auctioned to benefit Holocaust survivors.
</P>
<P>
However, the guidelines, endorsed Thursday by 44 countries at
the International Holocaust-era Assets here, aren't legally
binding on countries. The four-day conference ended Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The art world will never be the same in the way it deals with
Nazi-confiscated art," said Stuart Eizenstat, undersecretary of
state and head of the U.S. delegation sponsoring the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"From now on, the sale, purchase, exchange and display of art
from this period will be addressed with greater sensitivity and a
higher international standard of responsibility," he said.
</P>
<P>
The guidelines "represent a moral commitment among nations
which all in the art world will have to take into account," said
Eizenstat.
</P>
<P>
In their final session, delegates from country after country,
including France, Austria, Germany, the Netherlands and Denmark,
announced agreement with U.S.-drafted principles to investigate
the wartime heritage of art collections around the world to
determine if any works were looted.
</P>
<P>
The guidelines suggest the return to heirs or owners or
possible restitution.
</P>
<P>
Delegates, by consensus approval, also endorsed returning
communal property such as former synagogues, schools, community
centers and cemeteries to the care of Jewish groups in Eastern and
Central Europe after decades of being in the hands of the Nazis or
communist governments.
</P>
<P>
Outstanding life insurance claims from as many as 800,000
Jewish families would also be paid off within two years, if
possible, by an international commission formed earlier this year,
under another key conference principle.
</P>
<P>
Eizenstat said he was "impressed... almost overwhelmed" by what
the conference had accomplished in four days in working to set
informal standards on dealing with art and communal property that
remains unclaimed or outside Jewish control so many years after
World War II.
</P>
<P>
But many obstacles still remain in returning what the World
Jewish Congress estimates is about 110,000 pieces of "missing art"
from the Holocaust that is considered looted and of unclear
origin.
</P>
<P>
The estimated value of the artworks is 10 billion to 30 billion
U.S. dollars, according to the Jewish Congress.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Press Urged Not to Publish Unresearched </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 3 (Xinhua) --The Ugandan Presidential Office
has urged the press here not to publish unresearched stories
because they often mislead the public.
</P>
<P>
The office made the call in response to two what it considers
ungrounded stories carried in the Monitor daily dated November 24
and the Crusader newspaper dated December 3.
</P>
<P>
In a press release issued Thursday, Presidential Press
Secretary Hope Kivengere said the presidential office is gravely
concerned about the increasing tendency by the press to write
wild, unresearched stories.
</P>
<P>
The Monitor report said President Yoweri Museveni shocked his
security team by unexpectedly changing his flight to Rwakitura
and flew to Rwanda to hold talks with Rwandese Vice-President
Paul Kagame.
</P>
<P>
The press release said the story is ungrounded because the
president went to his home that weekend and did not go out of the
country.
</P>
<P>
The Crusador report alleged that Museveni returned home from
the recently ended Franco-Africa summit in Paris by taking a
South African Airforce plane because his presidential jet was
targeted by his enemies.
</P>
<P>
Hope said the president used a South African plane both to and
from Paris because his jet was out of the country on its normal
regular service.
</P>
<P>
She said the two papers should have contacted the President's
Office to get correct information to avoid publishing wild
allegations and called for all media to avoid sensational,
unresearched stories.

<HEADLINE> OECD Says Rules for International Investment Needed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD) said Thursday that it is
necessary to establish rules for international investment.
</P>
<P>
But senior OECD officials failed to agree at an informal
meeting Thursday in Paris to resume talks on a Multilateral
Agreement on Investment (MAI), which went into a deadlock last
December because of a boycott by France.
</P>
<P>
France wishes to protect the domestic cultural market from an
overwhelming influence from the United States by imposing
restrictions on investment by U.S. audio and video products
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
The OECD said in a communique that its 29 member countries have
agreed to work on the rules for investment which will be first
applied within its member countries.
</P>
<P>
"There exist in fact a certain number of important issues which
need new analysis and inter-governmental cooperation," said the
communique.
</P>
<P>
Some hope that the talks on MAI should be transferred to the
World Trade Organization, but the proposal has met with opposition
from some developing countries which are against imposition of
international rules on investment.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Decides to Extend MONUA's Mandate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council Thursday decided to extend the mandate of the United
Nations Observer Mission in Angola (MONUA) until February 26,
1999.
</P>
<P>
The decision came in a resolution adopted unanimously by the
15-member Security Council after it considered a report on the
current situation in Angola by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
The resolution demanded that the rebel UNITA "comply
immediately and without conditions with its obligations, in
particular the complete demilitarization of its forces and full
cooperation in the immediate and unconditional extension of state
administration throughout the national territory."
</P>
<P>
The resolution called on the leadership of UNITA to "cooperate
fully and immediately" with the MONUA in the withdrawal of the
U.N. mission personnel from the conflict-hit areas of Andulo and
Bailundo, and held the leadership of the rebel group "responsible
for their safety and security."
</P>
<P>
The Security Council said in the resolution that "the primary
cause of the crisis in Angola and of the current impasse in the
peace process is the failure by the leadership of UNITA in
Bailundo to comply with its obligations" under the peace accords
and relevant U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The resolution was sponsored by Portugal, Russia and the United
States, the three countries which are in a group to monitor the
peace process in Angola.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that the Angolan government has agreed to
the extension of the mandate of the MONUA until February next
year.
</P>
<P>
In his report to the Security Council last week, Annan said
that "the overall political, military and security situation in
the country has further deteriorated. The dialogue between the
government and (Jonas) Savimbi and his movement has ceased."
</P>
<P>
The MONUA was sent into Angola under a Security Council
resolution on June 30, 1997 to monitor the peace process in the
African country.

<HEADLINE> EU Increases Trade Ties with Asian Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brussels, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The 15 European Union (EU)
countries have increased more imports from 11 Asian countries and
areas. EU's trade deficit with the Asia region rose last year to
31 billion ECU (some 34 billion U.S. dollars) from 16.2 billion
ECU (17.8 U.S. dollars) in 1996, according to EU's statistics
available here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The 11 Asian countries and areas are China, Japan, South Korea,
Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Brunei
and Vietnam, as well as China' Hong Kong. They have been denoted
as Asia 11 since they participated in the Asia-Europe Meeting
(ASEM) in London in April this year, the statistics report said.
</P>
<P>
The 15 European countries' imports of goods from the Asia 11
amounted to 168.3 billion ECU (185.1 billion U.S.dollars) in 1997
while their exports to the Asia 11 region totalled 132.8 billion
ECU (146 billion U.S. dollars). The report showed the
corresponding figures for 1996 were 139.3 billion ECU (153.2
billion U.S. dollars) and 123.1 billion ECU (135.4 billion
U.S.dollars).
</P>
<P>
The report said the negative balance overall last year comes
mainly from that of the Britain (-15.3 billion ECU) and the
Netherlands (-13.9 billion ECU), while small positive balances
recorded by some other EU member states were not enough to
compensate.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the EU deficit resulted from large negative balances
with Japan (-23.3 billion ECU) and China (-20.09 billion ECU). But
the large deficit was offset by a positive balance of 12.1 billion
ECU with Hong Kong, the report shows.
</P>
<P>
During last year, both EU's imports and exports from and to the
Asian 11 region were concentrated in machinery and transport
equipment, which accounted for over half of all trade. These
products, together with miscellaneous manufactures, were
responsible for the EU being over 30 billion ECU (33 billion
U.S.dollars) in the red, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The statistics also showed that imports to the EU from Asia 11
came mainly from Japan (36.2 percent), ASEAN (28 percent) and
China (22.8 percent), which represent 17.6 percent up from 1996 to
1997, higher than the rise of 14.9 percent in extra-EU imports in
general.
</P>
<P>
This "implies an increasing share of Asia 11 in extra-EU
imports", the report said.

<HEADLINE> Egypt's Human Rights Group Stops Activities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The Egyptian Organization for
Human Rights (EOHR) Thursday announced to freeze its activities in
Egypt.
</P>
<P>
In a board meeting, the organization's general assembly was
asked to meet within three months to review the decision.
</P>
<P>
The board denied once again any link between a check of 25,703
U.S. dollars EOHR received from the British embassy in Cairo and
its report on what it called religious prosecution in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
EOHR insisted that it has not conducted any activities that
might subject itself or any members to legal procedures.
</P>
<P>
EOHR's decision followed the detention of its secretary
general, Hafez Abu Saada, Wednesday, accused of "receiving foreign
funds with the intention of damaging national interests."
</P>
<P>
The private-owned Al Usbou weekly newspaper reported that EOHR
got the check from the British embassy after it released the
report alleging police torture of Christian Copts in southern
Egypt. The weekly described the report as treason.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper testified on October 25 to the Egyptian public
prosecution by showing a copy of the check and a copy of the
organization's report.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's higher State Security Court issued the detention
warrant Wednesday after questioning Abu Saada over the issue. He
would face seven to 15 years of hard labor if convicted, judicial
sources said.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Gazette newspaper reported on Tuesday that EOHR in
its September report said that more than 1,000 Copts were rounded
up by security forces in Kosheh village in southern Suhag
Governorate.
</P>
<P>
Based on the allegation, Britain's Sunday Telegraph newspaper
reported that "Egyptian Christians have been subjected to horrific
crucification rituals, raped and tortured by the security forces
during a crackdown on the ancient Coptic community."
</P>
<P>
Egypt's parliament, social groups and celebrities have
denounced the story in the British newspaper as a fabrication
aimed at defaming Egypt.
</P>
<P>
They said that the Muslims and Christians have been co-existing
in peace for more than 14 centuries in Egypt.

<HEADLINE> Algeria to Intensify Consultations on Oil Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Algeria would intensify
consultations with other members of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) on ways to raise oil prices.
</P>
<P>
Algerian Minister of Energy and Mines Youcef Yousfi, who is
current chief of the OPEC, made the remark Thursday in a press
briefing on the fringe of an international conference on gas now
in session here, the Algerian News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The current price slump is very serious for the oil producing
countries, which lost some 80 billion U.S. dollars this year, he
said. Algeria alone incurred a loss somewhere between 2.5 and 3
billion, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The main factors of the crisis, he said, are the heated
speculations after the OPEC meeting in Vienna on November 26
failed to agree upon new cuts in oil production and the weak
demand on the oil market this winter.
</P>
<P>
The majority of the OPEC members were in favor of production
cuts to curb the imbalance of the oil market, but differences on
the production cut quotas blocked any new resolutions during the
meeting, Yousfi said.

<HEADLINE> Egypt's Trade Deficit Rises in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's trade deficit in the
first eight months of 1998 was 28.22 billion Egyptian pounds (8.3
billion U.S. dollars), a 37.39 percent rise from the same period
last year.
</P>
<P>
A monthly report issued Thursday by the Cabinet Information and
Decision Support Center attributed the increase of the deficit to
the fall in export and rise in import, the Middle East News Agency
said.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Egypt exported 6.87 billion pounds (2.02
billion dollars) worth of goods in the January-August period, down
about 21 percent from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The imports, on the other hand, rose about 20 percent from a
year earlier to reach 35.09 billion pounds (10.32 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Manufactured and semi-manufactured exports in the period stood
at 3.85 billion pounds (1.13 billion dollars), compared to 4.02
billion pounds (1.18 billion dollars) of the same 1997 period.
</P>
<P>
Exports of raw materials and cotton was 845 million pounds
(248.5 million dollars), compared to 806 million pounds (237.1
million dollars) in the first eight months in 1997.

UNITED NATIONS, December 3 (Xinhua) -- United Nations agencies
Thursday issued a consolidated appeal for 28 million U.S. dollars
to respond to the humanitarian need of more than 310,000
internally displaced people and to support needs of 450,000
refugees uprooted by the conflict in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The lingering conflict and the terror exacted on the civilian
population by remnants of the rebel junta continue to have a
devastating impact on the abuses including mutilation, sexual
exploitation and forced recruitment of child soldiers by rebels.
</P>
<P>
With the political and military support of the international
community, most notably by the Economic Community of West African
States (ECOWAS), and assistance provided by the United Nations,
"the prospects for an end to the protracted conflict may yet be in
sight," said the U.N. agencies.
</P>
<P>
The determination and commitment of the majority to rid the
country of the undemocratic and barbarian elements acting within
Sierra Leone underscore the resolve for lasting peace and
recovery, the agencies said.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations, in cooperation with the Government of
Sierra Leone, donors, international organizations and a consortium
of non-governmental organizations, has set out a coordinated
strategy of humanitarian assistance.
</P>
<P>
The program includes a strong emphasis on the promotion of
human rights as a means of addressing the root causes of the
conflict, the agencies said.

WASHINGTON, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The United States had more
than 1.2 million abortions in 1996, or 20 abortions per 1,000
women aged 15 to 44, the government reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said there were
1,221,585 abortions in 1996, an increase of less than 1 percent
from the previous year. It was the first time abortions have not
declined since 1990, when the total was more than 1.4 million.
</P>
<P>
The nation legalized abortions nationally in 1973. Since then,
abortion rates had increased steadily until 1980, when they
reached 25 per 1,000 women aged 15 to 44. But they leveled off
through 1992, when rates began falling again.
</P>
<P>
The Associated Press quoted the Centers as saying that the
decline may have been caused by a drop in unwanted pregnancies.
Abortion rights supporters have said there are also fewer clinics
performing abortions.

quarter over the previous quarter in the Summer, the Labor
Department said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The increase in the productivity of nonfarm, nonsupervisory
workers in the July-September quarter, measured as output per hour
of work, was even better than the 2.3 percent seasonally adjusted
rate reported in an initial estimate last month.
</P>
<P>
After growing at a brisk 2.9 percent annual rate in the 1960s
and early 1970s, productivity slowed to a 1 percent a year from
1974 through 1995. Since then, it's been growing at about a 2
percent rate.
</P>
<P>
Some economists believed that the U.S. economy has embarked on
a new era of productivity growth, driven by computers and other
high-tech innovations.
</P>
<P>
In the third quarter, hours worked rose a slight 1.2 percent at
nonfarm businesses. Compensation per hour rose at a strong 4.1
percent rate. But output increased at an even more robust 4.2
percent rate. That meant that unit labor costs, a key measure of
underlying inflation pressure, rose at a tame 1.1 percent annual
rate.
</P>
<P>
At factories, productivity increased at a 5.2 percent rate.
Output was up only slightly, at a 0.7 percent rate, but hours
worked plummeted at a 4.3 percent rate.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the level of jobless claims reported for last week
was still below the level of early November. However, a four-week
moving average rose by 250 to a seasonally adjusted 319,250.

<HEADLINE> Livingston Wants Impeachment Inquiry Completed This Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Incoming Speaker Bob
Livingston made clear Thursday he wants the U.S. House of
Representatives to vote on impeachment by year's end.
</P>
<P>
"I can't say I'd be perfectly happy" if the fight extends into
the new year, Livingston said during a news conference with Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott. He said that could happen only if
impeachment investigators didn't wrap up work by next week.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, White House lawyers are preparing a "vigorous
defense" of Clinton and demanding sensitive fund-raising memos and
other material gathered by Republican investigators.
</P>
<P>
Livingston said it is too early to make any decision on whether
the House should consider censuring Clinton as an alternative to
impeachment -- an option that has some support in both parties.
"I'm just not going to make a decision on that," he said.
</P>
<P>
Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde told Republican members
in a conference call Thursday morning that the staff review of
Justice Department memos detailing alleged fund-raising
irregularities in Clinton's campaign in 1996 did not yield
information worth considering for articles of impeachment, several
committee officials said.
</P>
<P>
"The evidence from the Department of Justice being examined in
relation to possible campaign finance violations will not be a
part of the inquiry next week," Representative Asa Hutchinson, a
Republican, said through his spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Representative Peter King, a Republican, was circulating a
censure proposal Thursday. It would include a strong condemnation
of Clinton and require him to pay a financial penalty and issue a
statement acknowledging wrongdoing, according to King's spokesman,
Kevin Fogarty.
</P>
<P>
Livingston told reporters he had discussed impeachment briefly
in meetings this week with House Majority Leader Dick Armey and
Majority Whip Tom DeLay.
</P>
<P>
The White House legal team accepted an invitation from the
Judiciary Committee Wednesday to make a defense before the inquiry
next Tuesday and possibly even call witnesses, but demanded access
to the fund-raising memos and additional investigative material
related to Monica Lewinsky and Kathleen Willey.
</P>
<P>
The Judiciary Committee is preparing for four days of hearings
next week, beginning with the White House defense and ending with
possible votes on at least one article of impeachment. If such a
proposal passes, the full House is likely to vote the following
week.

<P>
WASHINGTON, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. National Research
Council called for increased climate research and the impact of
weather on human health in a report released here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In the report entitled "The Atmospheric Sciences Entering The
21st Century," the council said that weather forecasts of the
future could include human health impacts, levels of various
pollutants and even the effect of changes in energy from the sun.
</P>
<P>
"Understanding the links between weather, climate and various
diseases and how they spread will require collaboration" among
various sciences, noted the report.
</P>
<P>
The report said that temperature, rain, sunshine, wind,
humidity and soil moisture may well affect the emergence and
spread of infectious diseases.
</P>
<P>
It called for the study of space weather because variations in
the flow of energy from the sun can affect conditions on Earth,
particularly electronic communications by radio, television and
satellite.

<HEADLINE> U.S. FAA Orders Airlines to Keep Fuel in Tanks on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Aviation
Administration on Thursday ordered airlines to keep fuel in the
center tanks on Boeing 747s to prevent sparks by shaft bearings
in the tank's fuel pump when the tank is dry.
</P>
<P>
The agency also ordered airlines flying the 747-400 series,
planes with unique turned-up edges on their wings, to stop using a
fuel tank in the base of the plane's tail for the same reason.
</P>
<P>
The FAA made the orders after mechanics recently found wear in
pumps that after only 200 hours of operation although the pumps
normally operate for at least 20,000 hours before they are
removed.
</P>
<P>
The FAA is concerned that if the pump is run after the tank is
dry, the metal-on-metal contact could throw off sparks. There are
about 700 suspect bearings in new and overhauled pumps and part
kits.
</P>
<P>
The FAA orders apply immediately to all 246 U.S-registered
747s. There are 1,087 Boeing 747s worldwide. FAA orders do not
apply to foreign aircraft, but foreign aviation agencies usually
follow FAA suggestions on safety matters.

<HEADLINE> New Degradable Plastic Launched in UK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 3 (Xinhua) -- A new degradable plastic,
launched Thursday in the UK which can disappear completely in as
little as 60 days, may mean an end to plastic pollutions.
</P>
<P>
Symphony Environmental Ltd, the British company which developed
the plastic, said that the innovation has profound implications
for post-consumer waste, especially in relation to food packaging
and its effect on the environment.
</P>
<P>
The plastic works by combining an additive with a blend of
polythene resins during the plastic production process. The
additive can "tell" the plastic when to start breaking down.
</P>
<P>
The degradation process begins during the normal usage of the
product with any combination of heat, light and stress acting as
catalysts.
</P>
<P>
Once the plastic is fully broken down, all that's left is a
negligible amount of water and carbon dioxide, the company told a
news conference.
</P>
<P>
The unique aspect of the new material is the controllable
nature of the degradation process. The timescale of degradation is
adjusted according to the application of the polythene film; for
example, bread bags and rubbish bags will have different life
spans.
</P>
<P>
When engineered, the material can degrade completely in as
little as 60 days or as long as five to six years depending on the
requirements of the product, the company said.

<HEADLINE> European Markets Surge as Central Banks Cut rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The European Stock markets had a
roller-coaster ride Thursday as Europe's central banks unveiled a
coordinated cut in interest rates for the introduction of euro on
January 1.
</P>
<P>
In London the FTSE 100 index closed higher for the first time
in four sessions, up 1.1 percent after a roller-coaster session
boosted by the rate cuts.
</P>
<P>
As the market opened Thursday morning the index went into
instant freefall plunging 112.8 points in the opening few minutes.
</P>
<P>
But the tide turned late in the morning, as the concerted rate
cuts by euro-zone nations led by Germany fired volatile European
shares to higher closes.
</P>
<P>
A 7 percent rise in Royal Bank of Scotland shares helped boost
the bank sector, which accounted for some 20 points of the FTSE
100's rise.
</P>
<P>
Germany's blue-chip Xetra DAX index also turned early losses
into gains as central banks across Europe cut interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The Index was up 2.1 percent at 4,812.00 points, rebounding
after spending most of the day in negative territory.
</P>
<P>
Among the big winners were Lufthansa which was up 6.2 percent
to DM 37.60, and Deutsche Telekom up 5.3 percent at DM 49.60
</P>
<P>
On the Paris bourse, leading French stocks soared on the news
of the cuts, closing up 1.8 percent at 3,715.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the rate cut, share prices soared higher,
with leading stocks up 2.26 percent at 3,732.36 points.

<HEADLINE> EU Enhances Fight against Cartels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brussels, December 3 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU)
competition commissioner Karel van Miert said here Thursday that
the union will continue its staunch fight against cartels which
are one of the most harmful restraints of trade.
</P>
<P>
To this effect, He said, it is necessary to form a new unit to
fight against cartels. The new unit, which has started its work
this week, is charged exclusively with unveiling, pursuing and
eliminating cartels for any product and service related
activities.
</P>
<P>
From now on, the new service will become the anchor of the
commission's ongoing fight against cartels, Van Miert said. About
20 experienced officials have been assigned to the new unit for
"complex and painful accurate investigations."
</P>
<P>
The commission pointed out that where cartels operate consumers
must pay higher prices than they would in the event of real
competition and do not benefit from technological improvements,
which manufactures would necessarily have to implement if only
they fought honestly for developing their companies and increasing
market share.
</P>
<P>
"This new administrative unit reflects the commission's
determination to give a clear political signal: unfortunately, to
this day too many companies are tempted by the apparently simple
implementation of agreements with competitors, without considering
the damage inflicted on all citizens," the commissionner said.

<HEADLINE> Duelfer Denies Meeting With Iraq's Dissidents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Charles Duelfer, An
American and deputy chairman of the Untied Nations Special
Commission (UNSCOM), on Thursday denied Iraq's charges that he met
last week with Iraq's dissidents.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz sent a letter to U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan this morning, charging that Duelfer
met dissident groups seeking the overthrow of Iraq's President
Saddam Hussein while he was in London last week.
</P>
<P>
Duelfer said it was coincidental he was in London on the same
day several Iraqi opposition groups met a top-ranking U.S. State
Department official.
</P>
<P>
Duelfer said he was in London on November 24 to meet with
British government officials on UNSCOM business and did not meet
with groups opposed to Iraq's Government.
</P>
<P>
Duelfer said he did not know of a meeting of Iraqi dissident
groups in London until he saw a television report.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's Ambassador to the United Nations Nizar Hamdoon said the
main thrust of Aziz's letter was that Americans serving with UNSCOM
are actively seeking to push Washington's agenda while serving
with the U.N. and UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
"Duelfer is an international officer. He should not get
involved in anti-Iraqi campaigns. Iraq is considering these
types of activities of UNSCOM as being inconsistent with the
mandate of UNSCOM," Hamdoon said.

<HEADLINE> UK Minister Launches Teaching Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The British government Thursday
announced far-reaching changes to the teaching profession in
England, introducing proposals for performance-related pay and a
fast-track entry scheme to attract better-qualified graduates.
</P>
<P>
Introducing a consultative Green Paper on teachers' pay and
conditions to the House of Commons, Education Secretary David
Blunkett said the 1 billion pound (1.65 billion U.S. dollar) a
year package of "radical, modernizing" reforms would create a "new
professionalism" among teachers.
</P>
<P>
Both individual teachers' pay and school budgets would be
linked to performance, in proposals that have already been
condemned as unfair by the country's largest teachers' union.
</P>
<P>
Instead of national rates of pay, based on length of service
and responsibilities, there will be a new system which rewards
teachers who are judged to be high performers.
</P>
<P>
Blunkett announced proposals for a "tough new appraisal
system," carried out by headteachers, which will assess whether
teachers should be paid up to an extra 10 percent in performance
pay -- an increase of about 2,000 pounds (3,300 dollars) per year.
</P>
<P>
These high-quality teachers, who show "high and sustained
levels of commitment," will represent a majority of staff in a few
years, Blunkett predicted.
</P>
<P>
There is also to be a fast-track entry grade for the country's
best graduates, promising rapid promotion to the Advanced Skills
Teacher grade at salaries of up to 40,000 pounds (66,000 dollars).
This is intended to help overcome the recruitment crisis which has
seen teacher training colleges struggling to fill places on
courses.
</P>
<P>
Teachers' pay and low status are seen as one of the reasons
behind the shortage of graduates willing to join the profession,
particularly in maths, science and foreign languages at secondary
level.
</P>
<P>
At present, most classroom teachers start on around 15,000
pounds (24,700 dollars) a year and advance over several years to a
maximum salary of just 23,000 pounds (38,000 dollars) -- unless
they take on extra duties.

<P>
BRUSSELS, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The 15 European Union (EU)
countries have agreed to promote European pathways in work-linked
training in a bid to encourage the mobility of people in
vocational training and to link schools and business training
centers throughout the union area.
</P>
<P>
In the framework of the achievement of the union's internal
market and the implementation of a knowledge-based Europe, the EU
said here Thursday, the mobility of people has become an
increasing element of European citizenship as well as an
intercultural and social instrument.
</P>
<P>
However, the activity of the EU cannot be restricted to simply
encourage the mobility of people in training, the EU commission
said. Conditions must also be created in order to provide maximum
efficiency to these training schemes and proper visibility must
also be given to training periods accomplished in member states.
</P>
<P>
Ministers of the 15 EU member states formally approved the
action program Wednesday. The European pathway in work-linked
training also includes apprenticeship, which emphasizes
complementarity of schools and businesses for European people to
learn knowledge and skills, the commission said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Paging Market Highly Competitive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese paging market is
becoming maliciously competitive with some companies attracting
customers away from other companies by selling at or bellow cost,
according to officials of the Ministry of Information Industry
(MII).
</P>
<P>
China's paging market has boomed since 1994, when the country
opened up the sector to private companies. By September this year,
pager users had been increasing by 10 million a year. Currently,
China has 65 million pager users.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, there are over 2,000 paging companies nationwide,
"one-third of which are too small in size" and there are too many
of them, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
They stressed at a recent national meeting on the paging
industry that it forbids any unfair-competition practices that go
so far as to give away free pagers and charge only service fees.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has already adopted measures that make it
technically more complicated for pager users to change frequencies.
</P>
<P>
MII officials said it encourages mergers among paging
companies, and that this should be the future direction for the
paging industry.

<HEADLINE> Kidd Takes Over as Blackburn Manager </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Brian Kidd, right-hand man to
Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson, took over as boss for
Blackburn Rovers on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Brian Kidd has accepted the position as manager of Blackburn.
He has signed a contract that will keep him here until June 30,
2002," said Rovers chief executive John Williams.
</P>
<P>
Kidd, United's assistant manager, agreed a four-year deal to
move up the road from Old Trafford after talks with Blackburn's
steel magnate owner Jack Walker.
</P>
<P>
The job became vacant after Blackburn sank to the bottom of
the league and sacked Roy Hodgson on November 21.
</P>
<P>
Walker will introduce Kidd to Rovers fans before Saturday's
home game with Charlton Athletic, but caretaker Tony Parkes will
stay in charge for that match.
</P>
<P>
Rovers moved swiftly after they were given permission to talk
to Kidd on Wednesday when United chief executive Martin Edwards
agreed to let Blackburn approach him.
</P>
<P>
Despite his success at United, Kidd has only limited
managerial experience gained during short spells at Barrow and
Preston North End in the mid-eighties.
</P>
<P>
Walker said: "I am delighted Brian has decided to join us. He
was always our first choice."
</P>
<P>
Kidd was expected to treble his 200,000 pounds (334,000
U.S.dollars) salary by moving to Ewood Park. He will also be
handed an open cheque book to ensure Blackburn beat the drop.
</P>
<P>
The move was a disappointment for Ferguson, who had been just
as keen to keep the man who has been his assistant since August
1991.
</P>
<P>
Ferguson said after Manchester United lost 3-1 to Spurs in the
League Cup quarter-finals on Wednesday that he did not want Kidd
to leave.
</P>
<P>
"It would be a terrible blow to lose Brian. A terrible blow to
the club and a terrible blow to me personally. We have a
fantastic working relationship."
</P>
<P>
Kidd is part of United folklore, scoring a goal on his 19th
birthday in Manchester United's 4-1 victory over Benfica in the
European Cup final at Wembley on May 29 1968.
</P>
<P>
He also played for Arsenal, Manchester City, Everton and
Bolton in a 15-year career which included two England caps.

<P>
WASHINGTON, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Mike Tyson's probation
officer will file court papers by Monday that could put the
former heavyweight champion back to prison.
</P>
<P>
George Walker, the chief probation officer fro Marion Superior
Court, said Thursday it appears Tyson violated terms of his
probation as a result of his no-contest plea to misdemeanor
assault charges in Maryland on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Tyson served three years on a 10-year sentence in Indiana for
rape. He was sentenced in 1992, and his probation expires in
March.
</P>
<P>
"The judge can do everything from nothing all the way to
imposing the originally suspended sentence, and anything in
between," Walk said. The judge also could modify the sentence or
place new conditions on Tyson's probation.
</P>
<P>
Although the no-contest plea was not an admission of guilt,
Tyson could face up to 20 years in prison. He also could be fined
up to $5,000.

<HEADLINE> Tourism Booms in East China's Shandong Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The tourism industry in east
China's Shandong Province reported an annual growth of 29.3
percent in the number of overseas visitors and that of 33.5
percent in the income from catering them, in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
The income of the domestic tourism sector also soared 92
percent on a yearly basis in the period.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the province reaped 23 billion yuan in income,
accounting for 3.46 percent of the province's GDP.
</P>
<P>
Of the total, 21.4 billion yuan stemmed from the year's 54.88
million domestic visitors to Shandong, with the rest coming from
580,000 overseas tourists.
</P>
<P>
During the two decades of China's reforms and opening-up since
1978, the number of domestic visitors has amounted to 400 million,
and that of overseas tourists reached 3.42 million.
</P>
<P>
The province now has over 500 scenic spots, more than 130
hotels of various classes, and more than 150 travel services, 45
of which handle international tourism and have contracts with more
than 150 overseas travel services.
</P>
<P>
Shandong has also used over 300 million U.S. dollars of
overseas money and 3.1 billion yuan of domestic investment to
build 15 tourist resorts.
</P>
<P>
The tourism industry in the province has a total fixed asset of
10.4 billion yuan beside that in the resorts, and has 430,000
tourist-industry employees.

TIANJIN, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Construction of a
330-million-yuan natural gas power plant has begun in the largest
north China port city of Tianjin, the first of its kind ever built
locally.
</P>
<P>
With some 50,000 square meters of floor space, the Binhai

The power plant will install units with a combined capacity of
250,000 kw, and is expected to ease local power supply shortages.
</P>
<P>
The oil fields in western part of the Bohai Sea went into
operation in 1997 and have an annual production capacity of
500,000 tons of oil and up to 400,000 cubic meters of natural
gas.

<P>
WASHINGTON, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Michael Jordan returned to
join the NBA labor talks Thursday when the season looks in
jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
His agent said he wouldn't get involved again until
discussions got serious.
</P>
<P>
"His understanding was that a new proposal was going to be
made by the owners," said agent David Falk. "He wanted to be
there to listen to it. You can read into it that he's continuing
to be involved and supportive of the union leadership."
</P>
<P>
After about six hours of talks, neither side had put anything
new on the table.
</P>
<P>
The bargaining session was the first in 13 days with both full
negotiating committees in attendance. If the owners and players
can't come up with a solution in the next few weeks, the entire
1998-99 season likely will be canceled.
</P>
<P>
The last time Jordan attended a bargaining talk was October
28. He spent more than 8 hours to help reach a deal.
</P>
<P>
Jordan left early in the evening, and it was unclear if he
would return.
</P>
<P>
The sides spent the first two hours merely "feeling each other
out," commissioner David Stern said. No improvement after the
lunch break.

<HEADLINE> Banks' Nonperforming Loans Up in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Nonperforming loans of
commercial banks in the Philippines inched up to 11.04 percent in
September, from 10.5 percent in August, as interest rates on loans
and other production costs continue to hurt business.
</P>
<P>
But the Business World Friday cited Central Bank Governor
Gabriel Singson as saying that the rate is still lower than that
of other Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
The uptick in nonperforming loans is consistent with the
central bank's expectations of a 0.5 percent to one-percentage
point increase monthly, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Singson said that of the country's 24 commercial and thrift
banks that suffered problems after the regional crisis broke out,
only two needed to be closed.
</P>
<P>
Other bankers believe that the nonperforming loan level in the
country will continue to rise up to the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Land Bank of the Philippines President Florido Casuela
predicted that the nonperforming loan level will peak at 14
percent to 15 percent as banks declare more losses due to
continued weak economic performance.

<HEADLINE> Chilean Air Force to Maintain Ties with Spanish, UK Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The Chilean Air Force (FACH)
will go ahead with its defense projects with British and Spanish
companies, despite the detention in London of retired General
Augusto Pinochet requested by a Spanish magistrate.
</P>
<P>
FACH Commander-in-Chief General Fernando Rojas Vender said on
Thursday that "it is not opportune yet to take a decision" on the
eventual suspension of the arms order or joint projects with Spain
and the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
"We have a great friendship with both countries and as long as
the theme is maintained in the political field we will follow
whatever the government decides on the matter of foreign
relations," said Rojas.
</P>
<P>
He also said that political and commercial matters must be
separated "since it takes much work to construct these friendships
with the armed forces."
</P>
<P>
The FACH is now working with Spain on a satellite project and
considering the acquisition of Casa 295 planes from Spain.
</P>
<P>
It has also selected, together with other three models (two
from the United States and one French), a British-Swedish aircraft
to replace the Chilean fighter aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The model is the Gripen JAS-39, of SAAB.A.B. and British
Aerospace, whose possible acquisition is "temporarily frozen"
because of budgetary reasons, according to FACH sources.
</P>
<P>
"We have to wait for the outcome of the events. We need to be
cautious and follow the line adopted by the government of
President Eduardo Frei about these matters," said Rojas.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet was detained in London 48 days ago at the request of
Spanish Judge Baltasar Garzon, who wants him extradited to face
charges of crimes against humanity committed under his military
government from 1973 to 1990.

<HEADLINE> IMF May Postpone First Disbursement of Aid to Brazil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The International
Monetary Fund (IMF) could delay the delivery of its first loan of
5.3 billion U.S. dollars to Brazil, according to a television
report on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The "Globonews" channel quoted IMF sources as saying that the
organization was considering the move after the Brazilian Congress
rejected on Wednesday a government reform program for the pensions
system, supposed to be crucial for the budget adjustment plan.
</P>
<P>
The adjustment plan, subject to congressional approval, was the
basis for the negotiations that opened the doors for an
international rescue package of 41.5 billion dollars agreed upon
on November 13 by officials of the IMF and the largest Latin
American economy.
</P>
<P>
A earlier report had said that 5.3 billion dollars would be
available immediately.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian government announced, after the defeat in the
parliament, that it would study other ways to obtain the same
savings that could have guaranteed the reform to the pensions
system.
</P>
<P>
One possible way could be to cut investments in infrastructure,
according to government sources.
</P>
<P>
However, the announcement apparently failed to pacify local
stock markets, which on Thursday opened with a downward trend and
closed the day with big losses amid doubts generated by the
parliamentary rejection.
</P>
<P>
The Sao Paulo Stock Exchange, the most important in Latin
America, closed with an 8.78 percent fall, while the Rio de
Janeiro market, the second largest in the country, dropped by 8.9
percent.
</P>
<P>
The worries were echoed on the same day at the New York Stock
Exchange, which was down by 2.05 percent, under shadows cast by
the Brazilian adjustment and a 2.5 percent drop in Japan's gross
domestic product.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Guerrillas Accept Christmas Ceasefire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The alliance of
Colombia's major rebel groups on Thursday accepted a national
"Christmas truce" requested last week by President Andres Pastrana.
</P>
<P>
Alberto Builes, the governor of Antioquia, received a letter
from the United Self-Defenses of Colombia (AUC) declaring they
would abstain from launching attacks from December 20 to January 6
to give the country a peaceful Christmas holiday.
</P>
<P>
Carlos Castano, the AUC's top commander, told Builes in the
letter that the Christmas ceasefire declaration was in response to
the passionate request from the president.
</P>
<P>
Pastrana's call, heeded by Congress representatives and the
Catholic Church of Colombia hierarchy, was in keeping with the
insurgents' tradition of declaring a unilateral and temporary
ceasefire during the Christmas and New Year festivals.
</P>
<P>
The Colombian Liberation Army (ELN), the second most important
guerrilla force in Colombia, stayed silent on the truce request.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Pro Athletes Expected to Get Tax Breaks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Canadian professional sports
teams and athletes should get tax breaks from the government, a
parliamentay report recommends here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A sport franchise could be eligible for a tax credit of about
3.2 million U.S. dollars on its first revenues of 32 million
dollars, and teams with higher revenues would be subject to a
lower rate.
</P>
<P>
It is also recommended that pro athletes should have a lesser
tax burden to resemble the U.S. system.
</P>
<P>
The report was represented to the House of Commons Thursday.
But all four opposition parties said giving tax breaks to
millionaire teams and athletes is unacceptable.

JAKARTA, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's net foreign
exchange reserves declined by 1.8 million U.S. dollars to 14.21
billion U.S. dollars in the week ended November 30, the Jakarta
Post Friday quoted a statement from Bank Indonesia as reporting.
</P>
<P>
The decline was due mainly to repayment of part of the
government's overseas debt, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
However, reserves were still well above the adjusted target
agreed with the International Monetary Fund, which stands at 11.26
billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> New Letter Bomb Found At Sydney Post Office: Radio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 4 (Xinhua) -- A package containing a parcel
bomb was found and detonated by Australian police in Sydney
Friday, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation News Radio
reported.
</P>
<P>
The bomb, found at Darlinghurst Post Office in inner Sydney,
was similar to 26 other potentially lethal parcel bombs at
addresses in Sydney, Canberra, Melbourne and the tropical tourist
attraction city of Gold Coast since Monday.
</P>
<P>
The parcel bomb panic started when one package exploded at a
mail exchange center in Canberra on Wednesday, injuring two postal
workers. Another 22 packages were later found in the center.
</P>
<P>
The building in Crown Street in Sydney had been evacuated just
after 9 am (local time) when staff had discovered a suspicious
package, a police spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The package had been detonated by the police bomb disposal and
rescue squad inside the post office late Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
The package was one of the three suspicious parcels discovered
by Sydney police Friday, and the other two packages were found to
be false alarms, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
Early Friday morning, police searched an evacuated train in a
railway station in southwest Sydney, and the Penrith branch of the
Australian Taxation Office in the city's far-western suburb amid
fears of possible bomb packages in the train or the office, but no
letter bombs were found.
</P>
<P>
Police Thursday named Colin George Dunstan, 43, a suspended tax
officer in Canberra, as the prime suspect and launched a
nationwide hunt for him.
</P>
<P>
Dunstan was once involved in a bitter workplace sexual
harassment case and is now considered suicidal.
</P>
<P>
Australian Federal Police Assistant Commissioner Bill Stoll
said there was no indication of politically motivated violence or
any connection with any terrorist groups.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the letter bomb scare spread to Darwin, Melbourne
and Sydney.
</P>
<P>
In Darwin, the country's northernmost port city, a suspicious
package prompted the evacuation of the Northern Territory's
Parliament House but bomb experts found the package was full of
leaflets.
</P>
<P>
A package similar of appearance to the bomb and addressed to
Victorian state government Minister Louise Asher at her office
caused an evacuation of Melbourne's ANZ Tower.
</P>
<P>
An empty briefcase caused the evacuation of a central business
district building in Sydney late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Australian Prime Minister John Howard Friday said Australia was
fairly free of modern day urban terrorism, but human nature could
become a lethal weapon.
</P>
<P>
Howard told Melbourne Radio 3AW that Australians had to pay the
price by living with higher levels of security at the moment.

<HEADLINE> Major Smuggling Attempts Foiled at Jakarta Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Customs and Excise officers at
Soekarno-Hatta International Airport here foiled attempts to
smuggle historical artifacts, compact discs and dried marijuana in
the month of November, the Jakarta Post reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The airport's head of customs and excise Heru Santoso said the
most valuable single haul of contraband consisted of antique
swords.
</P>
<P>
The consignment was uncovered on November 12, he said, adding
that the swords were in an airmail package sent from Medan in
North Sumatra to Madrid in Spain.
</P>
<P>
"It's the first airmail smuggling attempt we've ever been aware
of. Goods are usually smuggled in containers," Heru said.
</P>
<P>
The customs declaration stated that the package contained
souvenirs, however X-ray inspection revealed a number of swords.
</P>
<P>
Hari Untoro from the Ministry of Education and Culture's
directorate general for the protection of archeological goods said
the swords were very valuable.
</P>
<P>
Heru said his officers then foiled an attempt to smuggle 9,270
compact discs containing pirated computer software later the same
day.
</P>
<P>
Legitimate versions of the software would have retailed for a
combined total of 70 million U.S. dollars, he said, adding that
the haul included illegal copies of Auto Cad version 12, which
retails for 10,000 U.S. dollars a copy.
</P>
<P>
On November 20, a consignment of 1,100 pirated music compact
discs were intercepted, followed by 22,000 compact discs
containing pirated music and pornographic films on November 23.
Both shipments were destined for Singapore, Heru said.

<HEADLINE> Lay Assessors Should Have Legal Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Legal experts said that the
improvement of public awareness of the country's laws and
education in legal matters is the precondition for the proper
function of the people's lay assessor system, according to today's
China Daily.
</P>
<P>
"People's lay assessors must have certain educational level and
have some legal knowledge," said He Lianshui, attorney-at-law with
the Beijing Yuanwang Law Firm.
</P>
<P>
Many legal professionals maintain that, in cities like Beijing
and Shanghai, lay assessors should have a college education.
</P>
<P>
"Lay assessors should think independently, only when this is
achieved can the system function well," said Chen Ruihua, a law
professor with Beijing University.
</P>
<P>
Since most lay assessors have no systematic legal education,
they feel intimidated in front of judges, especially if
disagreements arise, which often results in assessors just
listening to trials without making their own judgements.
</P>
<P>
Though insisting that the length of sentences requires in-depth
legal knowledge and should thus be left to judges, Chen said lay
assessors may prove to be even more objective than the judges in
determining the facts.
</P>
<P>
"People with certain experience in life and an ability to think
logically are capable of making judgements about facts," said Chen.
</P>
<P>
In cases involving sentences of five years' imprisonment or
more, he proposed that a jury of six lay assessors should be
formed in addition to the three judges.
</P>
<P>
Attorney He said the people's lay assessor system should work
well so long as it is adapted to the Chinese legal system.
</P>
<P>
The courts currently pay more attention to lay assessors'
proficiency in their individual fields than their legal knowledge,
said a judge from the intellectual property rights court in the
Beijing No.1 Intermediate People's Court, adding that this helps
judges to determine the facts of a case.
</P>
<P>
The jury system was introduced to China at the beginning of
this century, but ended with the fall of the Qing Dynasty
(1644-1911), and China inherited the people's lay assessor system
from the former Soviet Union.

MADRID, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of Spain on

</P>
<P>
The Central Bank described the move as a concerted action with
the other 10 European countries that are to launch the single
currency on January 1 next year, as well as a "preventive" step in
response to the world financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
With the single exception of Italy, which cut its interest rate
to 3.5 percent on the same day, the other member countries of the
euro system have all lowered their interest rates to three percent.
</P>
<P>
The 11 euro countries are France, Germany, Italy, Spain,
Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Portugal, Austria, Finland
and Ireland.

<HEADLINE> Plague Claims Seven Lives in East Kazakhstan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, December 3 (Xinhua) -- An outbreak of the plague in
eastern Kazakhstan has killed seven people and infected more than
600 others, the Interfax News Agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Between 40 and 50 people are believed to be infected everyday
in the East Kazakhstan state capital of Ust-Kamenogorsk as the
disease spreads rapidly through the population.
</P>
<P>
The Kazakh government has been forced to import medicines to
fight the plague as none of the Commonwealth of Independent States
has ever produced drugs for the disease.
</P>
<P>
A fire which destroyed 90,000 hectares of forest in east
Kazakhstan last year drove huge numbers of rodents out of their
usually habitat into residential areas where they passed diseases
to domestic animals and people.

<HEADLINE> DPR Korea Withdraws Women's Basketball Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 4 (Xinhua) -- As DPR Korea withdrew its
women's basketball team in the last minutes, the adjustments in
groupings have been made for the 13th Asian Games to be started
here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In order to avoid confusion, the remaining eight women's squads
are halved into two groups of Group E and F after the men's teams
are divided into four groups of A, B, C and D.
</P>
<P>
The new adjustments see the shift of the Philippines from Group
E to F after the withdrawal of DPR Korean women cagers.
</P>
<P>
Group E now includes South Korea, Chinese Taipei, Kazakhstan
and Thailand, while Group F pitches Japan against China,
Kyrgyzstan and the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The previous groupings were based on the Asian seedings as
South Korea ranked first, followed by Japan, China, Chinese
Taipei, DPR Korea and Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
"When DPR Korea pulled out its women's team, Kazakhstan moved
up to fifth seed, and host Thailand chooses its place in Group E
under the ruling of the International Basketball Federation," said
Sakchye Tabsuwan, chief of technical sub-committee.
</P>
<P>
Thus, only the Philippines and Kyrgyzstan become the remaining
unseeded teams with the former pitted in Group F in the late draw.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria to Cut Import Duties in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The Bulgarian government is to
cut most import duties from January 1, 1999, in a bid to revive
its economy, according to a senior customs official.
</P>
<P>
The tariff reduction will be made on almost all imported goods
that Bulgaria itself does not produce, said Plamen Minev, chief of
the General Customs Directorate, following a cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria's average tariff in 1999 will be 15.58 percent,
compared to 17.25 percent in 1997 and 16.18 in 1998. The downward
tendency will continue in the next two years so as to reach the
standard in the European countries where duties charged on
industrial goods average 4.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to the Bulgarian Telegraph Agency, the maximum tariff
of 74 percent will be charged on no more than 30 articles. Only
the tariff on cigarettes will go up due to considerably reduced
excise duties.
</P>
<P>
Duties on crude oil will keep their previous level of five
percent and those on petrol will drop from 25 to 22.5 percent.
Such imports as breeding animals, soy oil, and baby milks and
foods will be exempt from tariffs.
</P>
<P>
Also on the reduction list will be a number of industrial
goods, with the highest at 35 percent. The reduction, however,
does not cover ready-made clothes, shoes, household utensils and
automobiles.
</P>
<P>
Almost all articles under the information technologies
agreement within the World Trade Organization, all raw materials
(apart from oil), medical equipment and medicines will be exempt
from customs charges.
</P>
<P>
The tariff on wheat, pork, sunflower oils and proteins for
fodder production are temporarily reduced in order to keep the
home market balance in conditions of liberal export regulations.

<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar's foreign trade,

increased sharply over the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest official Economic Indicators issued by
the Central Statistical Organization, the total volume of foreign

</P>
<P>
Export in the period amounted to 685 million dollars, while
import went to 1.908 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Indian Stars Plagued by Injuries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Leander Paes and P. T. Usha,
the biggest names in the Indian delegation to the Asian Games,
have been troubled by injuries.
</P>
<P>
Men's tennis star Paes is unlikely to chase his goal of
three gold medals after suffering an ankle injury during the
world doubles championships last month.
</P>
<P>
Usha, former Asian athletics queen, may be denied a final Asian
Games gold medal by a hamstring injury she sustained in a domestic
 meet.
</P>
<P>
"We are keeping our fingers crossed about these two," an
Indian official said. "They will take part for sure but I am not
certain they can overcome these injuries to win gold medals."
</P>
<P>
Paes and his partner Mahesh Bhupathy, the world second-ranked
doubles pair, remain heavy favorites for the team and doubles
competitions.
</P>
<P>
Paes will have to withdraw from the singles event if he cannot
take the strain of three events.
</P>
<P>
The Indian star won the team and doubles events at the last
Asian Games in Hiroshima, Japan. But he lost the singles
semifinal to eventual winner Yong Yoon-il of South Korea.
</P>
<P>
The day Usha was named in a 27-strong squad for the Bangkok
Games to run the 200- and 400-meter races and the two relays,
she suffered a hamgstring injury during a domesitic race in
Calcutta.
</P>
<P>
"I felt a pain on my right hamstring on the second bend, but
I kept on running," Usha said then. "The pain continued so I
stopped near the finish line to avoid further injury."
</P>
<P>
Usha surprised critics during the Asian track and field
championships in Fukuoka, Japan, in July this year with a gold and
silver in the realys and two bronze medals in the 200 and 400
meters.
</P>
<P>
Usha jumped to fame in the 1982 Asian Games in New Delhi, where
she won two silvers. She followed that with four golds and a
silver at the Seoul Games four years later.

MADRID, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of Spain on
Thursday announced an interest rate cut from five percent to three
percent, following similar cuts by other banks in the euro zone.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank described the move as a concerted action with
the other 10 European countries that are to launch the single
currency on January 1 next year, as well as a "preventive" step in
response to the world financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
With the single exception of Italy, which cut its interest rate
to 3.5 percent on the same day, the other member countries of the
euro system have all lowered their interest rates to three percent.
</P>
<P>
The 11 euro countries are France, Germany, Italy, Spain,
Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Portugal, Austria, Finland
and Ireland.
</P>

percent, Paris by 1.51 percent, Milan by 1.83 percent and London

ALMA ATA, December 3 (Xinhua) -- An outbreak of the plague in
eastern Kazakhstan has killed seven people and infected more than
600 others, the Interfax News Agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Between 40 and 50 people are believed to be infected everyday
in the East Kazakhstan state capital of Ust-Kamenogorsk as the
disease spreads rapidly through the population.
</P>
<P>
The Kazakh government has been forced to import medicines to
fight the plague as none of the Commonwealth of Independent States
has ever produced drugs for the disease.
</P>
<P>
A fire which destroyed 90,000 hectares of forest in east
Kazakhstan last year drove huge numbers of rodents out of their
usually habitat into residential areas where they passed diseases
to domestic animals and people.

<HEADLINE> New Letter Bomb Found At Sydney Post Office: Radio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 4 (Xinhua) -- A package containing a parcel
bomb was found and detonated by Australian police in Sydney
Friday, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation News Radio
reported.
</P>
<P>
The bomb, found at Darlinghurst Post Office in inner Sydney,
was similar to 26 other potentially lethal parcel bombs at
addresses in Sydney, Canberra, Melbourne and the tropical tourist
attraction city of Gold Coast since Monday.
</P>
<P>
The parcel bomb panic started when one package exploded at a
mail exchange center in Canberra on Wednesday, injuring two postal
workers. Another 22 packages were later found in the center.
</P>
<P>
The building in Crown Street in Sydney had been evacuated just
after 9 am (local time) when staff had discovered a suspicious
package, a police spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The package had been detonated by the police bomb disposal and
rescue squad inside the post office late Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
The package was one of the three suspicious parcels discovered
by Sydney police Friday, and the other two packages were found to
be false alarms, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
Early Friday morning, police searched an evacuated train in a
railway station in southwest Sydney, and the Penrith branch of the
Australian Taxation Office in the city's far-western suburb amid
fears of possible bomb packages in the train or the office, but no
letter bombs were found.
</P>
<P>
Police Thursday named Colin George Dunstan, 43, a suspended tax
officer in Canberra, as the prime suspect and launched a
nationwide hunt for him.
</P>
<P>
Dunstan was once involved in a bitter workplace sexual
harassment case and is now considered suicidal.
</P>
<P>
Australian Federal Police Assistant Commissioner Bill Stoll
said there was no indication of politically motivated violence or
any connection with any terrorist groups.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the letter bomb scare spread to Darwin, Melbourne
and Sydney.
</P>
<P>
In Darwin, the country's northernmost port city, a suspicious
package prompted the evacuation of the Northern Territory's
Parliament House but bomb experts found the package was full of
leaflets.
</P>
<P>
A package similar of appearance to the bomb and addressed to
Victorian state government Minister Louise Asher at her office
caused an evacuation of Melbourne's ANZ Tower.
</P>
<P>
An empty briefcase caused the evacuation of a central business
district building in Sydney late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Australian Prime Minister John Howard Friday said Australia was
fairly free of modern day urban terrorism, but human nature could
become a lethal weapon.
</P>
<P>
Howard told Melbourne Radio 3AW that Australians had to pay the
price by living with higher levels of security at the moment.

<HEADLINE> Major Smuggling Attempts Foiled at Jakarta Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Customs and Excise officers at
Soekarno-Hatta International Airport here foiled attempts to
smuggle historical artifacts, compact discs and dried marijuana in
the month of November, the Jakarta Post reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The airport's head of customs and excise Heru Santoso said the
most valuable single haul of contraband consisted of antique
swords.
</P>
<P>
The consignment was uncovered on November 12, he said, adding
that the swords were in an airmail package sent from Medan in
North Sumatra to Madrid in Spain.
</P>
<P>
"It's the first airmail smuggling attempt we've ever been aware
of. Goods are usually smuggled in containers," Heru said.
</P>
<P>
The customs declaration stated that the package contained
souvenirs, however X-ray inspection revealed a number of swords.
</P>
<P>
Hari Untoro from the Ministry of Education and Culture's
directorate general for the protection of archeological goods said
the swords were very valuable.
</P>
<P>
Heru said his officers then foiled an attempt to smuggle 9,270
compact discs containing pirated computer software later the same
day.
</P>
<P>
Legitimate versions of the software would have retailed for a
combined total of 70 million U.S. dollars, he said, adding that
the haul included illegal copies of Auto Cad version 12, which
retails for 10,000 U.S. dollars a copy.
</P>
<P>
On November 20, a consignment of 1,100 pirated music compact
discs were intercepted, followed by 22,000 compact discs
containing pirated music and pornographic films on November 23.
Both shipments were destined for Singapore, Heru said.

<HEADLINE> Lay Assessors Should Have Legal Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Legal experts said that the
improvement of public awareness of the country's laws and
education in legal matters is the precondition for the proper
function of the people's lay assessor system, according to today's
China Daily.
</P>
<P>
"People's lay assessors must have certain educational level and
have some legal knowledge," said He Lianshui, attorney-at-law with
the Beijing Yuanwang Law Firm.
</P>
<P>
Many legal professionals maintain that, in cities like Beijing
and Shanghai, lay assessors should have a college education.
</P>
<P>
"Lay assessors should think independently, only when this is
achieved can the system function well," said Chen Ruihua, a law
professor with Beijing University.
</P>
<P>
Since most lay assessors have no systematic legal education,
they feel intimidated in front of judges, especially if
disagreements arise, which often results in assessors just
listening to trials without making their own judgements.
</P>
<P>
Though insisting that the length of sentences requires in-depth
legal knowledge and should thus be left to judges, Chen said lay
assessors may prove to be even more objective than the judges in
determining the facts.
</P>
<P>
"People with certain experience in life and an ability to think
logically are capable of making judgements about facts," said Chen.
</P>
<P>
In cases involving sentences of five years' imprisonment or
more, he proposed that a jury of six lay assessors should be
formed in addition to the three judges.
</P>
<P>
Attorney He said the people's lay assessor system should work
well so long as it is adapted to the Chinese legal system.
</P>
<P>
The courts currently pay more attention to lay assessors'
proficiency in their individual fields than their legal knowledge,
said a judge from the intellectual property rights court in the
Beijing No.1 Intermediate People's Court, adding that this helps
judges to determine the facts of a case.
</P>
<P>
The jury system was introduced to China at the beginning of
this century, but ended with the fall of the Qing Dynasty
(1644-1911), and China inherited the people's lay assessor system
from the former Soviet Union.

<HEADLINE> IMF May Postpone First Disbursement of Aid to Brazil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The International
Monetary Fund (IMF) could delay the delivery of its first loan of
5.3 billion U.S. dollars to Brazil, according to a television
report on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The "Globonews" channel quoted IMF sources as saying that the
organization was considering the move after the Brazilian Congress
rejected on Wednesday a government reform program for the pensions
system, supposed to be crucial for the budget adjustment plan.
</P>
<P>
The adjustment plan, subject to congressional approval, was the
basis for the negotiations that opened the doors for an
international rescue package of 41.5 billion dollars agreed upon
on November 13 by officials of the IMF and the largest Latin
American economy.
</P>
<P>
A earlier report had said that 5.3 billion dollars would be
available immediately.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian government announced, after the defeat in the
parliament, that it would study other ways to obtain the same
savings that could have guaranteed the reform to the pensions
system.
</P>
<P>
One possible way could be to cut investments in infrastructure,
according to government sources.
</P>
<P>
However, the announcement apparently failed to pacify local
stock markets, which on Thursday opened with a downward trend and
closed the day with big losses amid doubts generated by the
parliamentary rejection.
</P>
<P>
The Sao Paulo Stock Exchange, the most important in Latin
America, closed with an 8.78 percent fall, while the Rio de
Janeiro market, the second largest in the country, dropped by 8.9
percent.
</P>
<P>
The worries were echoed on the same day at the New York Stock
Exchange, which was down by 2.05 percent, under shadows cast by
the Brazilian adjustment and a 2.5 percent drop in Japan's gross
domestic product.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Guerrillas Accept Christmas Ceasefire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The alliance of
Colombia's major rebel groups on Thursday accepted a national
"Christmas truce" requested last week by President Andres Pastrana.
</P>
<P>
Alberto Builes, the governor of Antioquia, received a letter
from the United Self-Defenses of Colombia (AUC) declaring they
would abstain from launching attacks from December 20 to January 6
to give the country a peaceful Christmas holiday.
</P>
<P>
Carlos Castano, the AUC's top commander, told Builes in the
letter that the Christmas ceasefire declaration was in response to
the passionate request from the president.
</P>
<P>
Pastrana's call, heeded by Congress representatives and the
Catholic Church of Colombia hierarchy, was in keeping with the
insurgents' tradition of declaring a unilateral and temporary
ceasefire during the Christmas and New Year festivals.
</P>
<P>
The Colombian Liberation Army (ELN), the second most important
guerrilla force in Colombia, stayed silent on the truce request.

OTTAWA, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Canadian professional sports
teams and athletes should get tax breaks from the government, a
parliamentay report recommends here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A sport franchise could be eligible for a tax credit of about
3.2 million U.S. dollars on its first revenues of 32 million
dollars, and teams with higher revenues would be subject to a
lower rate.
</P>
<P>
It is also recommended that pro athletes should have a lesser
tax burden to resemble the U.S. system.
</P>
<P>
The report was represented to the House of Commons Thursday.
But all four opposition parties said giving tax breaks to
millionaire teams and athletes is unacceptable.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Rejoins NBA Labor Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Michael Jordan returned to
join the NBA labor talks Thursday when the season looks in
jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
His agent said he wouldn't get involved again until
discussions got serious.
</P>
<P>
"His understanding was that a new proposal was going to be
made by the owners," said agent David Falk. "He wanted to be
there to listen to it. You can read into it that he's continuing
to be involved and supportive of the union leadership."
</P>
<P>
After about six hours of talks, neither side had put anything
new on the table.
</P>
<P>
The bargaining session was the first in 13 days with both full
negotiating committees in attendance. If the owners and players
can't come up with a solution in the next few weeks, the entire
1998-99 season likely will be canceled.
</P>
<P>
The last time Jordan attended a bargaining talk was October
28. He spent more than 8 hours to help reach a deal.
</P>
<P>
Jordan left early in the evening, and it was unclear if he
would return.
</P>
<P>
The sides spent the first two hours merely "feeling each other
out," commissioner David Stern said. No improvement after the
lunch break.

the country.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald:

fight against a forest fire in Australia's Victorian state, while

</P>
<P>

intentions.

<HEADLINE> Banks' Nonperforming Loans Up in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Nonperforming loans of
commercial banks in the Philippines inched up to 11.04 percent in
September, from 10.5 percent in August, as interest rates on loans
and other production costs continue to hurt business.
</P>
<P>
But the Business World Friday cited Central Bank Governor
Gabriel Singson as saying that the rate is still lower than that
of other Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
The uptick in nonperforming loans is consistent with the
central bank's expectations of a 0.5 percent to one-percentage
point increase monthly, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Singson said that of the country's 24 commercial and thrift
banks that suffered problems after the regional crisis broke out,
only two needed to be closed.
</P>
<P>
Other bankers believe that the nonperforming loan level in the
country will continue to rise up to the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Land Bank of the Philippines President Florido Casuela
predicted that the nonperforming loan level will peak at 14
percent to 15 percent as banks declare more losses due to
continued weak economic performance.

<HEADLINE> Chilean Air Force to Maintain Ties with Spanish, UK Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The Chilean Air Force (FACH)
will go ahead with its defense projects with British and Spanish
companies, despite the detention in London of retired General
Augusto Pinochet requested by a Spanish magistrate.
</P>
<P>
FACH Commander-in-Chief General Fernando Rojas Vender said on
Thursday that "it is not opportune yet to take a decision" on the
eventual suspension of the arms order or joint projects with Spain
and the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
"We have a great friendship with both countries and as long as
the theme is maintained in the political field we will follow
whatever the government decides on the matter of foreign
relations," said Rojas.
</P>
<P>
He also said that political and commercial matters must be
separated "since it takes much work to construct these friendships
with the armed forces."
</P>
<P>
The FACH is now working with Spain on a satellite project and
considering the acquisition of Casa 295 planes from Spain.
</P>
<P>
It has also selected, together with other three models (two
from the United States and one French), a British-Swedish aircraft
to replace the Chilean fighter aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The model is the Gripen JAS-39, of SAAB.A.B. and British
Aerospace, whose possible acquisition is "temporarily frozen"
because of budgetary reasons, according to FACH sources.
</P>
<P>
"We have to wait for the outcome of the events. We need to be
cautious and follow the line adopted by the government of
President Eduardo Frei about these matters," said Rojas.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet was detained in London 48 days ago at the request of
Spanish Judge Baltasar Garzon, who wants him extradited to face
charges of crimes against humanity committed under his military
government from 1973 to 1990.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Paging Market Highly Competitive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese paging market is
becoming maliciously competitive with some companies attracting
customers away from other companies by selling at or bellow cost,
according to officials of the Ministry of Information Industry
(MII).
</P>
<P>
China's paging market has boomed since 1994, when the country
opened up the sector to private companies. By September this year,
pager users had been increasing by 10 million a year. Currently,
China has 65 million pager users.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, there are over 2,000 paging companies nationwide,
"one-third of which are too small in size" and there are too many
of them, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
They stressed at a recent national meeting on the paging
industry that it forbids any unfair-competition practices that go
so far as to give away free pagers and charge only service fees.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has already adopted measures that make it
technically more complicated for pager users to change frequencies.
</P>
<P>
MII officials said it encourages mergers among paging
companies, and that this should be the future direction for the
paging industry.

<HEADLINE> Kidd Takes Over as Blackburn Manager </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Brian Kidd, right-hand man to
Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson, took over as boss for
Blackburn Rovers on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Brian Kidd has accepted the position as manager of Blackburn.
He has signed a contract that will keep him here until June 30,
2002," said Rovers chief executive John Williams.
</P>
<P>
Kidd, United's assistant manager, agreed a four-year deal to
move up the road from Old Trafford after talks with Blackburn's
steel magnate owner Jack Walker.
</P>
<P>
The job became vacant after Blackburn sank to the bottom of
the league and sacked Roy Hodgson on November 21.
</P>
<P>
Walker will introduce Kidd to Rovers fans before Saturday's
home game with Charlton Athletic, but caretaker Tony Parkes will
stay in charge for that match.
</P>
<P>
Rovers moved swiftly after they were given permission to talk
to Kidd on Wednesday when United chief executive Martin Edwards
agreed to let Blackburn approach him.
</P>
<P>
Despite his success at United, Kidd has only limited
managerial experience gained during short spells at Barrow and
Preston North End in the mid-eighties.
</P>
<P>
Walker said: "I am delighted Brian has decided to join us. He
was always our first choice."
</P>
<P>
Kidd was expected to treble his 200,000 pounds (334,000
U.S.dollars) salary by moving to Ewood Park. He will also be
handed an open cheque book to ensure Blackburn beat the drop.
</P>
<P>
The move was a disappointment for Ferguson, who had been just
as keen to keep the man who has been his assistant since August
1991.
</P>
<P>
Ferguson said after Manchester United lost 3-1 to Spurs in the
League Cup quarter-finals on Wednesday that he did not want Kidd
to leave.
</P>
<P>
"It would be a terrible blow to lose Brian. A terrible blow to
the club and a terrible blow to me personally. We have a
fantastic working relationship."
</P>
<P>
Kidd is part of United folklore, scoring a goal on his 19th
birthday in Manchester United's 4-1 victory over Benfica in the
European Cup final at Wembley on May 29 1968.
</P>
<P>
He also played for Arsenal, Manchester City, Everton and
Bolton in a 15-year career which included two England caps.

<P>
WASHINGTON, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Mike Tyson's probation
officer will file court papers by Monday that could put the
former heavyweight champion back to prison.
</P>
<P>
George Walker, the chief probation officer fro Marion Superior
Court, said Thursday it appears Tyson violated terms of his
probation as a result of his no-contest plea to misdemeanor
assault charges in Maryland on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Tyson served three years on a 10-year sentence in Indiana for
rape. He was sentenced in 1992, and his probation expires in
March.
</P>
<P>
"The judge can do everything from nothing all the way to
imposing the originally suspended sentence, and anything in
between," Walk said. The judge also could modify the sentence or
place new conditions on Tyson's probation.
</P>
<P>
Although the no-contest plea was not an admission of guilt,
Tyson could face up to 20 years in prison. He also could be fined
up to $5,000.

<HEADLINE> Work-Linked Training to Be Launched in Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The 15 European Union (EU)
countries have agreed to promote European pathways in work-linked
training in a bid to encourage the mobility of people in
vocational training and to link schools and business training
centers throughout the union area.
</P>
<P>
In the framework of the achievement of the union's internal
market and the implementation of a knowledge-based Europe, the EU
said here Thursday, the mobility of people has become an
increasing element of European citizenship as well as an
intercultural and social instrument.
</P>
<P>
However, the activity of the EU cannot be restricted to simply
encourage the mobility of people in training, the EU commission
said. Conditions must also be created in order to provide maximum
efficiency to these training schemes and proper visibility must
also be given to training periods accomplished in member states.
</P>
<P>
Ministers of the 15 EU member states formally approved the
action program Wednesday. The European pathway in work-linked
training also includes apprenticeship, which emphasizes
complementarity of schools and businesses for European people to
learn knowledge and skills, the commission said.

<HEADLINE> UK Minister Launches Teaching Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The British government Thursday
announced far-reaching changes to the teaching profession in
England, introducing proposals for performance-related pay and a
fast-track entry scheme to attract better-qualified graduates.
</P>
<P>
Introducing a consultative Green Paper on teachers' pay and
conditions to the House of Commons, Education Secretary David
Blunkett said the 1 billion pound (1.65 billion U.S. dollar) a
year package of "radical, modernizing" reforms would create a "new
professionalism" among teachers.
</P>
<P>
Both individual teachers' pay and school budgets would be
linked to performance, in proposals that have already been
condemned as unfair by the country's largest teachers' union.
</P>
<P>
Instead of national rates of pay, based on length of service
and responsibilities, there will be a new system which rewards
teachers who are judged to be high performers.
</P>
<P>
Blunkett announced proposals for a "tough new appraisal
system," carried out by headteachers, which will assess whether
teachers should be paid up to an extra 10 percent in performance
pay -- an increase of about 2,000 pounds (3,300 dollars) per year.
</P>
<P>
These high-quality teachers, who show "high and sustained
levels of commitment," will represent a majority of staff in a few
years, Blunkett predicted.
</P>
<P>
There is also to be a fast-track entry grade for the country's
best graduates, promising rapid promotion to the Advanced Skills
Teacher grade at salaries of up to 40,000 pounds (66,000 dollars).
This is intended to help overcome the recruitment crisis which has
seen teacher training colleges struggling to fill places on
courses.
</P>
<P>
Teachers' pay and low status are seen as one of the reasons
behind the shortage of graduates willing to join the profession,
particularly in maths, science and foreign languages at secondary
level.
</P>
<P>
At present, most classroom teachers start on around 15,000
pounds (24,700 dollars) a year and advance over several years to a
maximum salary of just 23,000 pounds (38,000 dollars) -- unless
they take on extra duties.

<HEADLINE> European Markets Surge as Central Banks Cut rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The European Stock markets had a
roller-coaster ride Thursday as Europe's central banks unveiled a
coordinated cut in interest rates for the introduction of euro on
January 1.
</P>
<P>
In London the FTSE 100 index closed higher for the first time
in four sessions, up 1.1 percent after a roller-coaster session
boosted by the rate cuts.
</P>
<P>
As the market opened Thursday morning the index went into
instant freefall plunging 112.8 points in the opening few minutes.
</P>
<P>
But the tide turned late in the morning, as the concerted rate
cuts by euro-zone nations led by Germany fired volatile European
shares to higher closes.
</P>
<P>
A 7 percent rise in Royal Bank of Scotland shares helped boost
the bank sector, which accounted for some 20 points of the FTSE
100's rise.
</P>
<P>
Germany's blue-chip Xetra DAX index also turned early losses
into gains as central banks across Europe cut interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The Index was up 2.1 percent at 4,812.00 points, rebounding
after spending most of the day in negative territory.
</P>
<P>
Among the big winners were Lufthansa which was up 6.2 percent
to DM 37.60, and Deutsche Telekom up 5.3 percent at DM 49.60
</P>
<P>
On the Paris bourse, leading French stocks soared on the news
of the cuts, closing up 1.8 percent at 3,715.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the rate cut, share prices soared higher,
with leading stocks up 2.26 percent at 3,732.36 points.

<HEADLINE> EU Enhances Fight against Cartels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brussels, December 3 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU)
competition commissioner Karel van Miert said here Thursday that
the union will continue its staunch fight against cartels which
are one of the most harmful restraints of trade.
</P>
<P>
To this effect, He said, it is necessary to form a new unit to
fight against cartels. The new unit, which has started its work
this week, is charged exclusively with unveiling, pursuing and
eliminating cartels for any product and service related
activities.
</P>
<P>
From now on, the new service will become the anchor of the
commission's ongoing fight against cartels, Van Miert said. About
20 experienced officials have been assigned to the new unit for
"complex and painful accurate investigations."
</P>
<P>
The commission pointed out that where cartels operate consumers
must pay higher prices than they would in the event of real
competition and do not benefit from technological improvements,
which manufactures would necessarily have to implement if only
they fought honestly for developing their companies and increasing
market share.
</P>
<P>
"This new administrative unit reflects the commission's
determination to give a clear political signal: unfortunately, to
this day too many companies are tempted by the apparently simple
implementation of agreements with competitors, without considering
the damage inflicted on all citizens," the commissionner said.

<HEADLINE> Duelfer Denies Meeting With Iraq's Dissidents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Charles Duelfer, An
American and deputy chairman of the Untied Nations Special
Commission (UNSCOM), on Thursday denied Iraq's charges that he met
last week with Iraq's dissidents.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz sent a letter to U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan this morning, charging that Duelfer
met dissident groups seeking the overthrow of Iraq's President
Saddam Hussein while he was in London last week.
</P>
<P>
Duelfer said it was coincidental he was in London on the same
day several Iraqi opposition groups met a top-ranking U.S. State
Department official.
</P>
<P>
Duelfer said he was in London on November 24 to meet with
British government officials on UNSCOM business and did not meet
with groups opposed to Iraq's Government.
</P>
<P>
Duelfer said he did not know of a meeting of Iraqi dissident
groups in London until he saw a television report.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's Ambassador to the United Nations Nizar Hamdoon said the
main thrust of Aziz's letter was that Americans serving with UNSCOM
are actively seeking to push Washington's agenda while serving
with the U.N. and UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
"Duelfer is an international officer. He should not get
involved in anti-Iraqi campaigns. Iraq is considering these
types of activities of UNSCOM as being inconsistent with the
mandate of UNSCOM," Hamdoon said.

<P>
WASHINGTON, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. National Research
Council called for increased climate research and the impact of
weather on human health in a report released here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In the report entitled "The Atmospheric Sciences Entering The
21st Century," the council said that weather forecasts of the
future could include human health impacts, levels of various
pollutants and even the effect of changes in energy from the sun.
</P>
<P>
"Understanding the links between weather, climate and various
diseases and how they spread will require collaboration" among
various sciences, noted the report.
</P>
<P>
The report said that temperature, rain, sunshine, wind,
humidity and soil moisture may well affect the emergence and
spread of infectious diseases.
</P>
<P>
It called for the study of space weather because variations in
the flow of energy from the sun can affect conditions on Earth,
particularly electronic communications by radio, television and
satellite.

<HEADLINE> U.S. FAA Orders Airlines to Keep Fuel in Tanks on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Aviation
Administration on Thursday ordered airlines to keep fuel in the
center tanks on Boeing 747s to prevent sparks by shaft bearings
in the tank's fuel pump when the tank is dry.
</P>
<P>
The agency also ordered airlines flying the 747-400 series,
planes with unique turned-up edges on their wings, to stop using a
fuel tank in the base of the plane's tail for the same reason.
</P>
<P>
The FAA made the orders after mechanics recently found wear in
pumps that after only 200 hours of operation although the pumps
normally operate for at least 20,000 hours before they are
removed.
</P>
<P>
The FAA is concerned that if the pump is run after the tank is
dry, the metal-on-metal contact could throw off sparks. There are
about 700 suspect bearings in new and overhauled pumps and part
kits.
</P>
<P>
The FAA orders apply immediately to all 246 U.S-registered
747s. There are 1,087 Boeing 747s worldwide. FAA orders do not
apply to foreign aircraft, but foreign aviation agencies usually
follow FAA suggestions on safety matters.

<HEADLINE> New Degradable Plastic Launched in UK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 3 (Xinhua) -- A new degradable plastic,
launched Thursday in the UK which can disappear completely in as
little as 60 days, may mean an end to plastic pollutions.
</P>
<P>
Symphony Environmental Ltd, the British company which developed
the plastic, said that the innovation has profound implications
for post-consumer waste, especially in relation to food packaging
and its effect on the environment.
</P>
<P>
The plastic works by combining an additive with a blend of
polythene resins during the plastic production process. The
additive can "tell" the plastic when to start breaking down.
</P>
<P>
The degradation process begins during the normal usage of the
product with any combination of heat, light and stress acting as
catalysts.
</P>
<P>
Once the plastic is fully broken down, all that's left is a
negligible amount of water and carbon dioxide, the company told a
news conference.
</P>
<P>
The unique aspect of the new material is the controllable
nature of the degradation process. The timescale of degradation is
adjusted according to the application of the polythene film; for
example, bread bags and rubbish bags will have different life
spans.
</P>
<P>
When engineered, the material can degrade completely in as
little as 60 days or as long as five to six years depending on the
requirements of the product, the company said.
