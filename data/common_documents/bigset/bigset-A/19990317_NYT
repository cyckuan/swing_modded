UNDESERVING L.A. IS ON THE MONEY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Two cities were bidding for the affections of a
very wealthy, very insular few. One city had the concrete plan, the
other, all the right connections. We don't need to tell you who won
out in the end. Connections beat concrete plans sure as paper beats
rock.
</P>
<P>
   But enough about Salt Lake City and how it was aced out for the
1998 Winter Olympics by Nagano, Japan, setting into motion all the
bribes that padded the U.S. city's successful 2002 bid.
</P>
<P>
   Houston is the city standing today on the wrong side of the
tracks, wounded and wondering what the heck just hit it. Did anyone
get a glimpse of that NFL gravy train?
</P>
<P>
   Like Salt Lake City eight years ago, Houston had all the
infrastructure in place. Nearly $200 million in public funds had
been earmarked for a new $310 million stadium with a retractable
roof in the eighth-largest television market.
</P>
<P>
   Then Hollywood mogul Michael Ovitz signed on with one L.A. bid
and Eli Broad, the second-wealthiest man in a city that wears its
opulence on its fitted silk jacket sleeve, attached his bank
account to another. And all of the sudden the NFL owners couldn't
see the town for the tinsel.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of taking note of a populace altogether ambivalent about
pro football, the NFL owners saw the SECOND-LARGEST TELEVISION
MARKET in flashing neon lights. In the end it didn't matter that
L.A.'s two divergent bids are a perfect metaphor for the city they
represent, the NFL owners awarded Los Angeles an NFL franchise,
contingent on its settling on a stadium and locking in financing
and community support by Sept. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously money _ specifically the currency that comes with
higher overall television ratings and advertising rates _ was the
only thing that really mattered. Which raises the question, who's
chaperoning these football lords, Paul Tagliabue or His Excellency,
Juan Antonio Samaranch?
</P>
<P>
   As the Olympics apparently have for years, the 32nd NFL team was
awarded to the highest bidder rather than the most qualified bid.
Let's face it; it's hard to top 5.5 million television homes.
</P>
<P>
   Billionaire Bob McNair, who headed Houston's bid, is a
businessman above all else. So he could see where the vote was
headed before it became official on Tuesday. Thus, his lament:
``We've done everything they've asked us to do and we've done it in
a first-class way. You get frustrated, disappointed, but that's
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Tell Salt Lake City about it. That city was sitting awfully
pretty in 1991 before Japanese business interests collected a few
million dollars to give to IOC president Samaranch's pet project,
the Olympic Museum, and effectively bought the 1998 Games.
</P>
<P>
   The Salt Lake City Olympic organizers wised up after that. They
played the game by the IOC's house rules, greasing palms all the
way to the 1995 handshake with which they sealed the 2002 bid.
</P>
<P>
   Among the hundreds of thousands of dollars allegedly doled out
in cash or trips or gifts to IOC members and their families by the
Salt Lake Olympic Organizing Committee was a junket to the Super
Bowl for IOC member Phil Coles of Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Hmmmm. Any NFL owner game for a free trip to the Sydney 2000
Summer Games courtesy of Australian Rupert Murdoch? You know him;
the mate who owns the Fox network, which has a long-term television
deal with the league that just awarded a franchise to the city that
currently claims as its wealthiest resident . . . Murdoch.
</P>
<P>
   More than one can play that game, which is why you can expect
McNair to get in the NFL's hair the next few months. Even before
Tuesday's vote, he had let it be known he intends to go after
another city's franchise if Houston didn't get its own.
</P>
<P>
   He already has begun the courting process, writing nine owners
who are facing stadium issues and letting them know that if they
don't find love in their respective cities, then he and all of
Houston are standing by, with open checkbooks, open hearts and open
arms.
</P>
<P>
   An open checkbook bought Salt Lake City a second shot. Why not
Houston?
</P>
<P>
   Buried under the money trail is the unvarnished truth; L.A. no
more wants or deserves the NFL than Nagano residents wanted or
deserved the Winter Olympics. Sporting spectacles, whether they're
held once every four years or once every fall weekend, ought to be
bestowed upon the appreciative, not shoved down the throats of the
apathetic so that an elite few can pick gold out of their teeth. &QL;

RODMAN'S TEAMMATES TOLERANT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ Dennis Rodman could trade the blackjack tables for
the basketball court by the end of the Lakers' current road trip.
In the meantime, he can take solace in the fact he plays for an
extraordinarily understanding team.
</P>
<P>
   While the Lakers played the first two games of a six-game road
trip, Rodman was excused to tend to ``personal business,'' presumed
to be marital problems with wife Carmen Electra.
</P>
<P>
   Then he was spotted in Las Vegas. Somehow, even that didn't
bother the Lakers, who subscribe to a new-age brand of therapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's his psychologist, you know what I mean?'' Kobe Bryant
said. ``For me, it's basketball, for him it's gambling and doing
other things. . . . He's by himself. He's not fortunate like I'm
fortunate to have a strong family. If I had a problem, I'd go to my
family.''
</P>
<P>
   But seeking peace of mind at Caesar's?
</P>
<P>
   ``If that's his outlet, that's his outlet,'' Bryant said.
``Nobody's gonna say it's right, nobody's gonna say it's wrong.
It's his business.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Kurt Rambis said he heard Rodman might rejoin the team by
the end of the road trip, which concludes Monday in Dallas, but
he's not assuming anything.
</P>
<P>
   Rodman's camp, meanwhile, perhaps preparing to go into spin
mode, has hired a public relations firm to handle inquiries over
his absence. The firm issued the following statement: ``Dennis
appreciates the level of interest that people have taken in his
life. He's currently resolving personal matters and looks forward
to rejoining the Lakers with the same intensity that he's displayed
throughout his career. Dennis also appreciates the support of his
teammates and the Lakers' management.''
</P>
<P>
   Make that ``unconditional support.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal dismissed reports of Rodman's gambling trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in the most gossipy city there is, so you never know.
. . . I don't know if he was in Vegas or not,'' O'Neal said. ``But
if he was, that wouldn't be the right thing to do. But you never
know.''
</P>
<P>
   Reinforcements: The Lakers have hired Dave Wohl as an assistant
coach for his second tour of duty with the team. Wohl, a Lakers
assistant from 1982-85, fills the vacancy created when Rambis was
promoted to head coach after the dismissal of Del Harris.
</P>
<P>
   Wohl, a former head coach of the New Jersey Nets and assistant
for five teams, most recently served as vice president for
basketball operations for the Miami Heat, from 1994-96.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just here to help all of us out, to add his experience as
a former player, coach and general manager. He brings a lot of
knowledge and experience to the table,'' said Rambis, who played
under Wohl with the Lakers. ``To me it was a no-brainer.''
</P>
<P>
   Wohl will join the team in time for Thursday night's game in
Cleveland.

IT'S L.A.'S TEAM TO LOSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   By BOB KEISSER &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; Long Beach Press-Telegram &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   PHOENIX -- It's fourth down and six months to go for Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   National Football League executives and owners, fearful of
losing any chance of returning to Los Angeles in the foreseeable
future, pushed through a resolution here Tuesday giving L.A.
approval for an expansion team if it meets certain conditions in
the next six months.
</P>
<P>
   The league's 12-member expansion committee will meet in Los
Angeles in the next two-to-three weeks to scout the two stadium
site locations, Carson and the New Coliseum, and meet with the
proposed ownership teams led by entertainment leader Michael Ovitz
(Carson) and L.A. businessmen Ed Roski and Eli Broad (Coliseum).
The committee's first mandate is to reach a consensus on one L.A.
site and stadium project.
</P>
<P>
   The conditions are both specific and vague. The committee will
want to see specific documentation for the construction of a
state-of-the-art stadium, hard financing plans for both the stadium
and franchise fee, and the source and commitment of all public
investments and relationships.
</P>
<P>
   The more vague conditions include a commitment from the L.A.
business sector in terms of PSL and luxury suites sales; expansion
of ownership teams to include more L.A.-based business leaders;
veiled hints for more public money; and more interest from the
common fan in regards to the NFL's return to L.A.
</P>
<P>
   If neither L.A. group satisfies the league's conditions by
September 15, the expansion committee will recommend that a 32nd
team be given to Houston and businessman Robert McNair.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a good compromise. We've tightened up the window to
benefit Houston, and to clear up some things that are not clear in
Los Angeles,'' said Jerry Richardson, the Carolina Panthers owner
and co-chairman of the expansion committee. ``If we just went to
Houston, we'd never know if we could have gotten something done in
L.A.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bringing the committee to L.A. will give them a close look at
both sites and come back to the full ownership with a consensus. We
don't have an answer for all of our questions right now. It's a
short window to learn, but we have to start somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Both L.A. groups welcomed the news and considered it a personal
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thankful to have the NFL come back to Los Angeles,'' said
Ovitz, the former Hollywood agent and Disney Co. President. ``I'm
pleased that we have achieved this part of our goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, it's (L.A.'s) to lose. We'll continue to do our
best to make this happen. We're looking forward to showing the
league everything in our deal. We'll follow the league's cues.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We welcome the league coming out and going through all parts
of our project,'' said Roski, the L.A. Kings owner. ``Each time
we've been asked questions or given suggestions, we've followed
(the NFL's) lead and answered them. We're there. We have a plan, a
facility and the financial capability.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing standing in our way. I think fans in L.A. have
been waiting for this, and you'll now see a groundswell of
support.''
</P>
<P>
   The conditional resolution was devised and endorsed by
Commissioner Paul Tagliabue, vice-president of development Roger
Goodell, and a handful of key owners Richardson, New England's Bob
Kraft, Denver's Pat Bowlen who felt the league needed to explore a
return to L.A. fully before expanding somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   ``L.A. is an important city,'' said Bowlen. ``We're looking for
a deal. We want to know if either of these bids are viable. I'm
optimistic one is, because we should be in L.A.''
</P>
<P>
   Strong sentiment arose for Houston during the course of two days
of meetings, leading to the conditional terms and shorter window.
``We do not want to appear to be abandoning Houston,'' said
Steelers' owner Dan Rooney.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've (L.A.) got six months to get their house in order. I
want to see real interest in L.A., that they want a team and that
they have the wherewithal to build a stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue's promise to owners, sources said, was that a return
to L.A. would improve TV ratings (and subsequently rights fees) and
produce a larger franchise fee than another city.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue said Tuesday that ``I would be surprised if other
(L.A. business) people did not come into the picture'' with the
league's resolution. ``We'd like to see businesses come in like
they did in Carolina (when the Panthers won an expansion team) and
Cleveland.''
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue said the league hasn't urged the L.A. groups to merge
their forces, but the league expects a consensus. Once the league's
committee makes a decision, it expects the losing group to support
the winner.
</P>
<P>
   Roski said he invited Ovitz to join his group two years ago and
that the invitation still stands. He said that while he, Broad and
the handful of other equity owners can handle the financial side,
he's willing to add other business leaders to the ownership group
if the league feels it's necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Roski said he's not in a position to join any Carson group. He
has an exclusive contract to put a team in the Coliseum. Ovitz has
only a memoranda of understanding with Carson at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz spokesman Peter Levin said ``we take all of our cues from
the league. But we feel our proposal is great. If it were not for
Michael Ovitz, I don't think the NFL would even be looking at Los
Angeles. He deserves credit for stimulating the interest the league
has for L.A. today.''
</P>
<P>
   Carson city officials remain optimistic about their chances.
They expect to meet with Ovitz in the next few days to discuss the
NFL's visit and firm up their portion of all agreements, which
include a $150 million bond issue and a $30 million cash
contribution. A source close to the city said it may have access to
additional RDA funds if necessary, at no tax cost or liability to
the public.
</P>
<P>
   L.A. City Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas said there is no other
public money available for the Coliseum. ``The public financial
investment already there is significant and should not be
minimized,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The state has invested $120 million in infrastructure around the
Coliseum, the federal investment in facility upgrades (as a result
of the Northridge earthquake) are worth $100 million, and the land
where the Coliseum sits is worth $85 million.
</P>
<P>
   The city has invested $40 million in new money via a
Redevelopment Agency and ticket surcharges. And terms of an
operating arrangement will turn the operation of the facility from
the unwieldly Coliseum Commission to Roski and his group.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no more public money available,'' he said. ``The
league needs to be more flexible in regards to where the money
comes from. It has been our contention from the start that the
public should not have to.''

LA GETS CONDITIONAL NFL NOD  
 INVESTORS FACE SEPT. 15 DEADLINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Until at least Sept. 15, the NFL loves LA.
</P>
<P>
   But the league, which hasn't had a team in the Los Angeles area
since 1995, is giving the two groups trying to bring an expansion
team there a six-month deadline to meet the owners' conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Denver Broncos owner Pat Bowlen, attending the league meeting at
the Arizona Biltmore on Tuesday, called the Sept. 15 deadline, a
``drop-dead'' date.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it doesn't work in LA, we'll immediately move on to
Houston,'' said Carolina Panthers owner Jerry Richardson, chairman
of the expansion committee.
</P>
<P>
   The owners didn't choose between Los Angeles ownership groups _
entertainment mogul Michael Ovitz, who wants to build a stadium on
a former municipal landfill in Carson, Calif., or real estate
developers Edward P. Roski Jr. and El Broad, who want to rebuild
Los Angeles Coliseum. But they did say they expect to narrow the
decision to one site after visiting Los Angeles in two to three
weeks. The team would start play in the 2002 season.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL also announced that it would look at realigning into
four eight-team divisions beginning for that season.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why the NFL chose a conditional deal in Los Angeles when a
more solid one was presented by Houston businessman Bob McNair,
Cincinnati Bengals President Mike Brown said the league felt it
needed a team in the nation's second-biggest city.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to have a team there,'' Brown said. ``I don't know
if they can get it done, but they should at least try. It's the
best thing for the league.''
</P>
<P>
   The owner's resolution to place the league's 32nd franchise in
Los Angeles, which lost the Rams to St. Louis and the Raiders to
Oakland in 1995, passed by a vote of 29-2. The Raiders and Buffalo
Bills were the only dissenting votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do own the Los Angeles opportunity,'' said Al Davis,
president of the general partner of the Raiders who has filed a
lawsuit against the league claiming that he still owns the rights
to the market.
</P>
<P>
   Carmen Policy, president of the Browns, said the owners aren't
worried that Davis' suit could scare the league from putting an
expansion team in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Categorically, no,'' Policy said. ``. . . They are the Oakland
Raiders. They can't be the Oakland Raiders and the Los Angeles
Raiders at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   The owners weren't specific as to what conditions Los Angeles
has to meet other than providing the necessary funding for a
state-of-the-art stadium and more commitments from the Los Angeles
business community.
</P>
<P>
   ``What financial plan?'' Bowlen said. ``We haven't seen any
financial plan.''
</P>
<P>
   An NFL spokesman said the owners want to see the Los Angeles
business community pledge to sell luxury suites, club seats and
personal seat licenses.
</P>
<P>
   Roski thinks his deal at the Coliseum will eventually be
selected.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel we've gotten the project together,'' he said. ``We
think the venue is great. We think the ownership team brings a lot
to the table.''
</P>
<P>
   Some owners don't necessarily agree. San Diego Chargers owner
Alex Spanos said teams don't want to return to playing in the
Coliseum, which the Rams left in 1980 and the Raiders left in '95.
</P>
<P>
   Roski said if the owners prefer Ovitz as an owner and the Carson
site, he wouldn't be an obstacle to Los Angeles meeting the
league's deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're focused on getting an expansion team in LA,'' Roski
said. ``We're not going to stand in the way to get LA a team.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said Houston officials, who already have committed
nearly $200 million toward a $310 million facility, shouldn't take
the decision as ``gloom and doom.''
</P>
<P>
   McNair said he still is optimistic Houston might get the
franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having a deadline established is something we hoped for,''
McNair said. ``I think it will be a challenge for LA to get it
done. It was a challenge for us, and we have a lot more passion for
football than they do.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said it was up to the league to ``rekindle the
interest and create the passion of the NFL in Los Angeles. We have
to start somewhere. I don't think we help rekindle the interest and
passion if we go to Houston.
</P>
<P>
   In other business:
</P>
<P>
   NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue also announced that 49ers owner
Eddie DeBartolo will be fined $1 million and remain suspended
through next February for ``lying'' about being involved in
riverboat gambling in Lousiana.
</P>
<P>
   The owners are keeping the annual Thanksgiving Day games in
Dallas and Detroit and will vote on instant replay today.

NFL OWNERS PICK LOS ANGELES OVER HOUSTON 

</HEADLINE>
 -HNS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN WILLIAMS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Houston's yearlong wooing of the National Football
League turned to heartbreak Tuesday when league owners spurned its
plea for an expansion team in favor of aloof Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   By a 29-2 vote, the NFL approved a resolution to award Los
Angeles its 32nd franchise if that city can cobble together a
satisfactory ownership team and stadium deal by Sept. 15.
</P>
<P>
   League officials said that deadline could be extended if a deal
is close to completion by then.
</P>
<P>
   If negotiations fall short _ and many believe that the passive
Los Angeles football market can't swing a deal _ the league's
Expansion Committee will recommend that Houston get the expansion
team.
</P>
<P>
   Houston businessman Bob McNair called the decision a small
victory for Houston. He said he had feared that Los Angeles would
be given 10 months. His exclusive agreement with the Harris
County-Houston Sports Authority expires Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Los Angeles' tepid response, and its aversion to
using public dollars to build a stadium, McNair believes he still
has a chance to get the expansion team.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, he also will continue trying to buy an existing
team and move it to Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Asked after the vote if Los Angeles could get the deal done in
time, a smiling McNair said, ``It will be a challenge. It was a
challenge for us, and I think Houston has got much more passion for
football than Los Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   Expansion Committee Co-chairman Jerry Richardson, owner of the
Carolina Panthers, said the committee will go to Los Angeles within
three weeks to begin working on a deal.
</P>
<P>
   The league set up three vague criteria that must be satisfied
before Los Angeles gets a team. They are:
</P>
<P>
   _ A consensus about a specific site and stadium project in the
greater Los Angeles market.
</P>
<P>
   _ An agreement for the construction of a state-of-the-art
stadium that addresses the issues of financing, facility management
and other key items.
</P>
<P>
   _ Commitments from the business community to actively support
the re-establishment of a successful NFL franchise in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Roski, the only one of the three primary Los Angeles players
in town Tuesday, said that he was not sure exactly what his
proposal lacked and that a deal can be done now to satisfy the
league's criteria.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're ready to go today,'' Roski said. ``We have an existing
facility. We don't have to purchase the land. We don't have any
bond issues. We have the fan support and political support and
corporate support. We're ready to go.''
</P>
<P>
   One issue NFL officials said they will explore is exactly who
has control of the Coliseum, a point that could cause the league to
deal only with Roski.
</P>
<P>
   Several team owners would prefer to work out a deal in Los
Angeles, then sell it to the highest bidder, as they did for
Cleveland last year, when Al Lerner bid $530 million for an
expansion team.
</P>
<P>
   Roski said he has an exclusive two-year agreement for the
Coliseum, which appears to be the league's preferred site in Los
Angeles, but would waive it if it were in the city's best interest.
</P>
<P>
   While NFL officials won't directly come out and say it, the
league seems to want Los Angeles to commit public funds, thus
reducing the amount a new owner would have to put into a stadium
and increasing the expansion fee, which 31 team owners would share.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution approved Tuesday says that the ``NFL shall
immediately establish a public-private partnership in the greater
Los Angeles market to work toward satisfying the foregoing
condition.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There has to be some kind of public support,'' said San Diego
Chargers owner Alex Spanos.
</P>
<P>
   Under Houston's deal, which includes $195 million in public
dollars to subsidize a $310 million, retractable-roof stadium,
McNair says he can afford an expansion fee up to $500 million.
</P>
<P>
   Roski has said that neither Los Angeles nor the state of
California can fund a Coliseum deal because of the political
climate. He also said he can afford a $500 million franchise fee
and pay for a $350 million renovation of the Coliseum, all with
private funds.
</P>
<P>
   But there is disagreement within the Roski-Broad team, said a
source close to the group. Eli Broad has indicated he believes the
Los Angeles market can only afford a $400 million expansion fee if
it must also pay for a $350 million stadium update.
</P>
<P>
   League officials have discussed providing a low-interest loan to
help build a stadium, but only if the city provided some tax
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Such a plan was considered to help troubled teams in Boston,
Chicago and Philadelphia, but many owners are not willing to help
other teams after having to put together their own deals in smaller
cities.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, while Los Angeles is considered the better city
because it is a much larger television market, Roski will not
promise to do the same thing McNair has done to guarantee that all
home games are televised.
</P>
<P>
   McNair last week promised that all home games would be sold out
during the first five years, which would avoid potential television
blackouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that is important,'' Roski said.
</P>
<P>
   While the Los Angeles television market is attractive, many
owners did not want to discard a done deal in Houston that many
believe is one of the sport's best.
</P>
<P>
   Voting against the resolution were Oakland Raiders owner Al
Davis, who believes he still controls the Los Angeles market
despite leaving it four years ago, and Buffalo Bills owner Ralph
Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   During an emotional expansion committee discussion early in the
day, Houston received verbal support from Tennessee Titans owner
Bud Adams, who moved his team there three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion Houston will have a team at some point,'' Adams
said.
</P>
<P>
   Adams' opinion was shared by many owners who believe that the
league must eventually be in both cities. McNair had hoped the
league might expand to 33 teams, giving each city an expansion
club, but that proposal was ignored by owners who don't want to
dilute the talent pool or share TV revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Houston officials expressed optimism that the city would
eventually get an NFL team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am disappointed that the NFL did not recognize the benefits
of coming to Houston and award a franchise to this city outright,''
said Houston Mayor Lee Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Los Angeles may have a bigger media market, but Houston is a
great market and has the best deal and the best fan support.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the game is not over. There is no guarantee that Los
Angeles will be better-organized six months from now.''

CURSE OF THE CUBS  
 WOOD'S INJURY LATEST GLOOM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - There's nothing to support a hex. Nothing but the
cackle of a Billy Goat, the great collapse in '69, the shrieks of
Ron Santo as Brant Brown flubs a flyball.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing but a curse known as the Ex-Cub Factor, a library
book-ended by Donnie Moore and Bill Buckner. Nothing but the
missing void in Ernie Banks' career or the bumbling fate of Leon
Durham or the shadows that still follow Don Young.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing but Lou Brock-for-Ernie Broglio. Or an icon broadcaster
who died, missing out on Sammy in the White House and the biggest
party in years.
</P>
<P>
   And, now, the terrible twist in the legend of Kerry Wood.
</P>
<P>
   To truly know misery, you must be a Cubs fan. Only you can
appreciate how a gift from heaven blows out his arm, reduced to one
year of rehabilitation, minimum. How a phenom sent to save the
future is facing serious questions about his own. How Kerry Wood
might turn out to be an apparition, the cruelest tease of all.
</P>
<P>
   More than anything, this is sad. In the stardust of 1998, Kerry
Wood was Kid Whiff, the next dominant pitcher in baseball, the
unassuming face from Texas destined to become the millennium's
version of Nolan Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   He once struck out 20, turning the baseball world on its ear. He
was Rookie of the Year. He bought a home in Scottsdale. He had the
world bailing out in the batter's box.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, after one pitch in his exhibition debut, Wood once
again complained of discomfort in his elbow. He threw only
fastballs that day, lasting only four outs. And later that night,
he was despondent that the pain was still alive, under the surface,
waiting to explode.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel awful for that young man,'' team broadcaster Steve
Stone said. ``I know he was extremely disappointed before he found
out what was wrong. Just the fact that he still had pain in his
arm.''
</P>
<P>
   Surely, they are fuming inside Tribune Tower, wondering where
this went wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Was it at Grand Prairie High School in Texas and a coach who
rode him like a mule, once starting Wood in both games of a
doubleheader?
</P>
<P>
   Was it an inevitable breakdown of a power pitcher diagnosed with
bad mechanics?
</P>
<P>
   Or was it the botched decision to start Wood in Game 3 of last
year's playoffs, down two to the Braves in a series they couldn't
possibly win, ``after'' he had been shut down all of September
because of elbow problems?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe those five innings on a cold night in October mean
nothing. Or maybe a botched decision has tragic consequences.
</P>
<P>
   This is certain: Last season, Cubs Manager Jim Riggleman was
consistently booed for adhering to pitch counts, thus robbing
Wrigley Field patrons of complete games and the chance to hang K's.
Earlier this spring, he vowed that Wood would not exceed 200
innings in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   For the Cubs to risk everything for so little in last year's
postseason is wretchedly inept. And some people should know better
than to tempt fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to comment on that,'' Stone said.
</P>
<P>
   Truth is, no one knows when Wood's arm gave out. After striking
out 20 on a magical day at Wrigley, he came to Arizona and blew
away the Diamondbacks. After that, he won games, but the dominance
was missing. And now he's on the shelf for one year, maybe two.
</P>
<P>
   There are elbow specialists, advancements in medicine, reason to
hope that a 21-year-old has plenty of time to recover. But will he
ever be the same? The velocity? The breaking ball? Will he ever
have the ammunition to be like Ryan? To be great?
</P>
<P>
   Because, for a while, he was. As dominant as any young prospect
in memory, a kid who struck out 573 hitters in 445 innings since
breaking into the minor leagues, a symbol that the hex might be
history.
</P>
<P>
   Except it only gets worse.
</P>
<P>
   So the organization that hasn't been to the World Series in 91
years can wait 'till next century. And pray that the curse only
spanned the 1900s. &QL;

DONOVAN MAKES GATORS BELIEVE  
 COACH'S WORK ETHIC MODEL FOR PLAYERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD OBERT  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Billy Donovan still hears his father's voice in the
back of his mind. Do more. Don't quit. Work hard.
</P>
<P>
   It drove him as a player in Long Island, where he wore out
basketballs and would sneak into gyms to play.
</P>
<P>
   It drove him at Providence, where, prodded and challenged by
Rick Pitino, he shed 25 pounds and shot and dived and passed the
Friars to an unbelievable Final Four run in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   It drives him now at Florida, where he works endless hours,
snagging recruits away from national powerhouses and convincing
them to go to Gainesville, where, they say, there are only three
seasons: football, football recruiting and spring football.
</P>
<P>
   Now, driven by Donovan's passion, the Gators are two games from
the Final Four, a place they haven't come close to since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Florida began this season with four freshmen in the starting
lineup. Two, a pair of former McDonald's prep All-Americans, will
start Thursday in an NCAA West Region semifinal game against
Gonzaga at America West Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Coach Donovan is the best coach in America,'' freshman
guard Teddy Dupay said. ``He constantly challenges us. He doesn't
see limits in people. He believes we can get so much more out of
ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   That belief complements the Gators' ability to hit three-point
shots _ they were among the top five three-point shooting teams in
the nation _ press, play hard defense and run an up-tempo system
that Donovan learned from Pitino.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the fact that Billy made himself a good basketball
coach,'' said Florida Athletic Director Jeremy Foley, who hired
Donovan in 1996. ``I thought his work ethic was second to none. Now
that I've seen it firsthand, it is second to none.''
</P>
<P>
   Donovan, 33, still has a thick Long Island accent and talks so
fast that it is hard to keep up with all the names he mentions,
guys who took the challenge and made themselves better players
since he came to Florida two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Donovan was slow, short and chunky growing up in Long Island,
but he had an insatiable desire to be a basketball player.
</P>
<P>
   His father, Bill Donovan, who played at Boston College in the
early '60s, told him the only way he would make it would be to
outwork the next guy. He had to take more shots, run more gassers,
play more games.
</P>
<P>
   One time in college, feeling guilty for taking a day off, he
couldn't sleep. He cut the padlock off his old high school's gym
doors at 1 a.m. and played until 4 in the morning. When he left, he
put a new lock on the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did a lot of things out of fear,'' Donovan said. ``I didn't
want to look back on my career and realize I hadn't done enough.''
</P>
<P>
   After his sophomore year at Providence, after Pitino was hired
as head coach, Donovan was told that he would never play for Pitino
if he didn't lose weight. He went from bench warmer his junior year
to a fearless point guard and an honorable mention All-American his
senior year in '86-87, when he averaged 20 points and was the
outstanding player of the Southeast Region in the NCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Known as Billy the Kid, he still looks as if he could put on a
college uniform and knock down the threes.
</P>
<P>
   Clean shaven, his black hair slicked back, he also looks as if
he could be working on Wall Street, which he did after an NBA
career that lasted 44 games in '88 in a mop-up role for Pitino with
the New York Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   He was cut by the Knicks, lasted five weeks during the '88
preseason with the Utah Jazz and, after a short CBA stint, settled
in behind a desk on Wall Street, trying to convince people to give
him their money to invest. All the while, he missed basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really hard being away from it,'' he said. ``I couldn't
get basketball out of my blood. That's always been my life. That's
my passion.''
</P>
<P>
   He jumped at Pitino's offer to help him at Kentucky in '89. In
1994, Donovan became the youngest head coach in the nation when he
was hired by Marshall.
</P>
<P>
   In his first season, Marshall won 18 games and captured the
North Division championship in the Southern Conference. Marshall
won 17 games the next season, and Florida came after Donovan when
Lon Kruger left to become the coach at Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Donovan said Pitino advised him not to take the Florida job.
That became just another challenge for Donovan, who after 13-17 and
14-15 seasons has the Gators at 22-8.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Pitino) said, `Listen, they're not even close to getting to
the NCAA Tournament, let alone the Final Four,' '' Donovan said.
``He said people there probably think it's a year away, and the
expectations would be enormous.''
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, Donovan received a telegram in Seattle from
Pitino wishing him luck in the NCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   A nonstop recruiter, Donovan hooked recruits that many people
didn't believe he could get. Freshmen Mike Miller, a forward, and
Dupay came in with McDonald's All-America credentials. They lead
the team with scoring averages of 12.3 and 11.1 points a game.
</P>
<P>
   Another freshman, Udonis Haslem, is the third-leading scorer at
10.7 points a game.
</P>
<P>
   Another McDonald's All-American, 6-foot-2 point guard Brett
Nelson out of West Virginia, arrives in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Many thought the Gators would be hard-pressed to get into the
tournament this year, especially without star point guard Jason
Williams, who transfered from Marshall to be with Donovan, only to
be kicked off the team last season for failing a drug test.
Williams now starts for the Sacramento Kings.
</P>
<P>
   But Donovan's energy has rubbed off, and the Gators are having a
blast playing Billyball, running and shooting threes, playing hard
defense and winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think when I first took the job, a lot of people said it
would take five years to rebuild and get us in position to really
compete and win,'' Donovan said. ``We've been fortunate that the
younger guys have really stepped up and the guys returning have all
improved.''
</P>
<P>
   A little work. That's all it takes. &QL;

   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. - Like it or not, we cannot take our eyes
off Albert Belle. We can't help ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball fans have always been fascinated with the game's power
men. Whether it be Babe Ruth, Mark McGwire or even Jose Canseco,
there's just something about a human being who can pick up a wooden
stick and swat a baseball more than 400 feet that captivates us.
</P>
<P>
   We want to find out what separates these giants of the game from
the rest of the minions who plod along making their sensational
defensive plays or spraying their singles.
</P>
<P>
   So it should not come as any great surprise to Belle that we are
so intrigued with wanting to know what makes him tick.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, of course, is that the Baltimore Orioles' new right
fielder isn't the least bit interested in letting anyone inside his
complicated and highly intelligent mind.
</P>
<P>
   Every spring Belle says this year will be different, that he
will be more accessible and friendly toward all. Every season, the
``interview season,'' as he puts it, ends abruptly. Usually still
during the spring.
</P>
<P>
   So we are left to look in from the outside, separated by this
impenetrable wall that Belle has constructed around his persona. We
poke and prod this player who has made himself an enigma with nary
an acknowledgement that we exist. This goes for fans as well as
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Belle was sailing along this spring, chatting occasionally with
reporters, until he had one of his incidents last week. He was
frustrated after an 0-for-3 afternoon and stormed into the
clubhouse, sending equipment flying.
</P>
<P>
   After the incident was widely reported, Belle cut off all
interviews _ he said for the season. Before Tuesday's Grapefruit
League game between the Orioles and St. Louis, Belle politely
(honest) declined to be interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   Using the Belle scale, this particular event was tame. Unlike
several of his other episodes, it came in front of no fans. There
was no chasing down of delinquent pranksters in his vehicle or
throwing a baseball at a fan's chest. There wasn't even a verbal
attack of a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   This was simply Belle being Belle. In turn, he was offering a
glimpse of his inner workings _ which by no means should be
interpreted as a defense for his actions.
</P>
<P>
   Belle is as complex a personality as there is in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   He routinely does the`` New York Times'' crossword puzzle. He
was an above-average accounting major (can anyone imagine him
sitting behind a desk with a calculator?) at Louisiana State
University. It's just that Belle approaches the game far
differently than anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to visualize everything,'' Belle told ``The Arizona
Republic'' during a rare interview last spring. ``The only reason I
will ever change is because I want to, not for the public relations
department, or my family or the press. I don't want to give up free
time.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways we are living in the Albert Belle era. It can be
argued that he is the most feared hitter playing today. Since 1991,
Belle has more home runs, RBIs, doubles, extra-base hits and total
bases than anyone. That includes Barry Bonds, Ken Griffey and Juan
Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface it may appear that Belle has nothing more than a
savage approach to hitting. He stands in the batter's box staring
down the opposing pitcher with unwavering and fierce eyes. It's as
if he's telling the pitcher of the impending pain he is about to
apply to the baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, we know so little about Belle other than he has produced
some of the most astonishing numbers ever generated, like his 103
extra-base hits in 1995, more than any player in the last 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal isn't to win any popularity contest,'' Belle said. ``I
know I'm not the most popular player. Some people have it in for
me, and that's just the way it is. I'm not a player who is in it
for the money or fame and fortune. I just want to win.''
</P>
<P>
   That is probably at the crux of Belle's flare-ups. His intense
competitive nature usually takes over his frame of mind. Some 30
years from now, we will be watching highlights of Belle's career
and reminding our grandchildren of the fury with which Belle
played.
</P>
<P>
   The future will probably be kind to Belle, whose career may very
well take him to Cooperstown. If he doesn't want to stop for the
endorsements and flowery tributes, so be it.
</P>
<P>
   One thing cannot be taken away: Belle remains the most lethal
bat and the least known person in the game. And that's the way he
wants it. &QL;

ASU FRESHMAN LEADING WAY INTO NCAA FINAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF METCALFE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, ARIZ. - Out of an Arizona State wrestling recruiting
class ranked fourth nationally, only Eric Larkin was immediately
ready for the big time.
</P>
<P>
   Hector Torres (heavyweight) and Christian Luciano (174 pounds)
are redshirting at weights where ASU needed help.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure they couldn't have been ready this year, but it's
just a risk, especially at heavyweight,'' Coach Lee Roy Smith said.
``You can give someone a complex and ruin them for the rest of
their career.''
</P>
<P>
   Larkin, though, was different.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 junior national champion in freestyle and two-year
Greco-Roman champ brought not only credentials that couldn't wait
but a growing body bursting to get out of the 133-pound division.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the last time we'll see him there in all
probability,'' Smith said. ``He could grow into 149 before it's all
said and done. We knew we had one true freshman capable of being an
All-America and that the team needed him at that weight class.''
</P>
<P>
   In spite of the struggle to maintain his weight, especially
given a rib injury that took him out for almost a month, Larkin has
been brilliant. He goes to the NCAA Championships, Thursday through
Saturday at Penn State, as the Sun Devils' top-ranked qualifier
(No. 3) and with their best record (26-3).
</P>
<P>
   Smith thinks all six of his wrestlers could place in the top
eight to make All-America and that the Sun Devils, third in the
Pac-10, have a chance to be back in the top 10 for the first time
since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The hopes for an individual champion, the eighth in school
history, rest with Larkin and Casey Strand (184 pounds).
</P>
<P>
   Strand (33-5), a two-time All-America off fifth- and sixth-place
finishes at 167, was upset by Oregon's Doug Lee, 7-5, at the Pac-10
Championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``He let the match get away from him,'' Smith said. ``It
released some concerns that he has and knows he can't go to the
mats with. He's really put most of his marbles into putting
together the best tournament of his career. That's his mindset, and
the way you would want it.''
</P>
<P>
   Other ASU qualifiers are Matt Azevedo (26-12) at 125, Mark
Perryman (20-6) at 141, Quinn Foster (23-10) at 149 and Steve
Blackford (26-12) at 165.
</P>
<P>
   Of those, the biggest surprise is Perryman, a transfer from Cal
Poly-San Luis Obispo, who made nationals in 1997 at 134. He has won
13 of his last 15 matches, including a Pac-10 title run, and is
ranked 11th in what Smith said is perhaps the deepest weight class.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel real confident that no matter who he's competing
against and no matter how many matches he has to confront good
people, he will be able to perform up to his ability each and every
match,'' Smith said. ``He's as strong conditioningwise as anybody
we have.''
</P>
<P>
   Larkin's only losses are to Iowa State's second-ranked Cody
Sanderson, 6-2, and, 7-5, including riding time, and a medical
forfeit Dec. 29 at the Midlands Invitational when the rib injury
occured.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Sanderson) pretty much controlled the first match and kept
pressure on me,'' said Larkin, out of Tucson Sunnyside High School.
``I felt I could have beat him the second time.''
</P>
<P>
   Probably no one will stand atop the podium at 133 without going
through Oklahoma State senior Eric Guerrero (26-0), a two-time
national champion at 126. He and Larkin missed each other in a Jan.
10 dual in Tempe because of the Larkin's injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Larkin) has everything to gain,'' Smith said. ``He can
afford to go out and put all the cards on the table because he's
got plenty more chances.''
</P>
<P>
   Guerrero is critical to No. 1 Oklahoma State's hopes of holding
off No. 2 Minnesota to win a 31st NCAA title, the most of any team
in any sport.
</P>
<P>
   No. 5 Oklahoma knocked off the Cowboys, coached by Lee Roy
Smith's brother John, to win the Big 12 Championships. Iowa and
Minnesota finished ahead of Oklahoma State at the 1998 nationals. &QL;

SHANAHAN SAYS DRAFTING QBS HIGH IS RISKY BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - This won't be good news for NFL coaches planning to
take a quarterback in the top 15 picks in the draft.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Mike Shanahan, coach of the past two Super Bowl champions in
Denver, said quarterback usually is the ``worst evaluated''
position in the draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some guy will take somebody in the first round, and you rank
him as a fifth-round player,'' Shanahan said Tuesday during the
coaches breakfast at the NFL meetings at the Arizona Biltmore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another guy you have ranked in the fourth round is taken as
one of the top 10 picks.''
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan uses Kansas City Chiefs starter  &UR; Elvis Grbac, a
seventh-round pick of the San Francisco 49ers, as an example of
quarterbacks who were poorly evaluated in the draft.
</P>
<P>
   In this year's draft,  &UR; Tim Couch of Tennessee is expected to be
the first pick.  &UR; Akili Smith of Oregon,  &UR; Donovan McNabb of Syracuse
and  &UR; Daunte Culpepper of Central Florida also are expected to be
taken early.
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan said his philosophy is to take a quarterback every
other year regardless of how deep the team is at the position.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you see a quarterback in the third, fourth or fifth that
you feel is a second-round draft choice, why not take him?''
Shanahan said.
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan, who has made few mistakes evaluating talent with the
Broncos, said he had  &UR; Jake Plummer rated higher than the 11th pick
in the second round, which is where the Cardinals took him two
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had Jake a first-round draft choice,'' Shanahan said. ``He's
not big or strong or fast, but Jake could always make plays.'' &QL; 
Unhappy camper &QL; 
Green Bay General Manager  &UR; Ron Wolf, whose team received four
compensatory picks in the draft, is upset the picks weren't higher.
</P>
<P>
   The Packers received a third-round pick, two fourths and a
sixth.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to take away Pro Bowl players, how are we
supposed to replace those with fours?'' said Wolf, who lost
cornerback  &UR; Doug Evans, defensive lineman  &UR; Gabe Wilkins, punter
 &UR; Craig Hentrich, safety  &UR; Eugene
 &UR; Robinson, offensive guard  &UR; Aaron Taylor and running back  &UR; Edgar
Bennett in free agency a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The object is to replace them with threes. Obviously, the
object would be to replace them with ones or twos, but they (the
league) deem that not necessary. Plus, I don't think Einstein could
arrive at how they come to these (decisions).'' &QL; 
Invitation issued &QL; 
Seattle Coach  &UR; Mike Holmgren said the Cardinals asked about
scrimmaging with the Seahawks before their Aug. 28 preseason game
in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The teams would work out in Cheney, Wash., but Holmgren said he
likely will turn down the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buffalo also asked, but this being our first year in this
system, I don't think we're going to work with anybody,'' Holmgren
said. ``I want to do it with the Cardinals in the future.''
Tennessee Coach  &UR; Jeff Fisher, whose team plays a preseason game at
Sun Devil Stadium the weekend of Aug. 21, said he would be
interested in practicing with the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   The teams could work out in Flagstaff before the Cardinals break
training camp on Aug. 19.
</P>
<P>
   Shopping spree &QL; 
 &UR; Steve Zucker, the agent for free agent offensive tackle  &UR; Richmond
Webb, has been shopping his client at the meetings and asked the
Cardinals on Tuesday whether they were interested.
</P>
<P>
   Zucker was told the interest was minimal.
</P>
<P>
   Webb, who has spent his entire career with the Miami Dolphins,
is their franchise player. So the Dolphins can match any offer for
him.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals lost starting offensive tackle  &UR; Lomas Brown to
free agency but have said they plan to use a high pick in next
month's draft on an offensive tackle.
</P>
<P>
   Short shots &QL; 
Cleveland Browns President  &UR; Carmen Policy congratulated Cardinals
owner  &UR; Bill &UR; Bidwill on the NFL's resolution Monday that would give
the Valley a Super Bowl in 2004, 2005 or 2006 if the Rio Salado
Crossing stadium is built. ``I think that might be the first thing
ever done unanimously in this league,'' Policy said.
</P>
<P>
   The Carolina Panthers have inquired about free agent wide
receiver  &UR; Eric Metcalf, who played for the Cardinals last season.
</P>
<P>
   Former Cardinals offensive lineman  &UR; Ernest Dye, a 1994
first-round draft pick who was out of football last year, worked
out for the Pittsburgh Steelers on Tuesday in Phoenix. &QL;

PLUMMER'S PRESENCE EARNS MONDAY NIGHT GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - For the first time since 1995, the Cardinals will have
a Monday night game next season, NFL sources said Tuesday at the
league meetings.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals won't know their opponent and whether the game
will be at home or on the road until the schedule is released in
the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks real good for them,'' the source said. ``Something
could still happen that would change things, but I really like
their chances. They were better than a .500 team last year and have
(quarterback) Jake Plummer.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals, 9-7 last season, had their first winning season
in Arizona and won at Dallas in the NFC playoffs, their first
playoff victory in 51 years.
</P>
<P>
   They haven't played on Monday night since former Coach Buddy
Ryan's last game, a 37-13 loss to Dallas on Christmas night in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   Their only other Monday night game since moving to Arizona in
1988 was a loss that first season to Dallas in the home opener.
</P>
<P>
   It was speculated earlier that if the Cardinals played on a
Monday night next season, they would meet the San Francisco 49ers
or the Buffalo Bills.
</P>
<P>
   If the Cardinals played the 49ers, the game could be billed as
Plummer, who has been compared to a young Joe Montana, against
Montana's old team.
</P>
<P>
   Plummer would be matched against veteran scrambling quarterback
Doug Flutie against the Bills.
</P>
<P>
   Both games are scheduled for Sun Devil Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Plummer's agent, Leigh Steinberg, said he hadn't been told that
the Cardinals would play on a Monday night, but he said it would be
a big step for the franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of credibility and building a national reputation,
nothing other than a Super Bowl has more value than ``Monday Night
Football'','' Steinberg said. ``The audience is not the narrow
genre of the hard-core football fan. It extends beyond that to a
real enormous prime-time audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reputations are made, images are established, on ``Monday
Night Football.'' If `The Refrigerator' (William Perry) scores a
touchdown on a regularly scheduled game on local TV, he doesn't
become `The Refrigerator.' '' &QL;

COYOTES REV UP FOR DEFENDING CHAMPS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By TIM TYERS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the heels of a disappointing 5-5 tie against the Carolina
Hurricanes when the Coyotes regurgitated a three-goal lead in the
game's final 12 minutes, most coaches would be worried about their
team's mind-set.
</P>
<P>
   But Coyotes Coach Jim Schoenfeld has no such concerns tonight as
the Coyotes test the Detroit Red Wings, winners of two consecutive
Stanley Cup titles, at Joe Louis Arena.
</P>
<P>
   And, surprisingly, he said avenging an embarrassing 7-2 loss to
the Red Wings 12 days ago in Phoenix isn't a major factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Detroit, because of who they are, provides a situation where
you are naturally revved up for the game,'' Schoenfeld said. ``You
go into games with them with a sense of, `If we don't play our
best, we're going to get blown out of here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always a high-energy game, an emotional game and when you
have all these elements, the expectations are high. When you go
into the Joe (arena) you know anything less than your best won't
get the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is, the Coyotes already are going into the ``Joe''
with less than their best.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes are without three of their top six defensemen
(Gerald Diduck, Jyrki Lumme and J.J. Daigneault) and three solid
forechecking forwards (Juha Ylonen, Brad Isbister and Dallas
Drake). Drake suffered a strained shoulder against Carolina and
will be lost for seven to 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a team in the NHL that will exploit so many missing
parts, and the weariness it creates, it's Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have great depth and balanced scoring on four lines,''
said Schoenfeld, who added Carolina provided the same challenge
(with lesser talent) and basically wore the Coyotes down in the
final period.
</P>
<P>
   All that was needed was a quick review of the game statistics to
see as much. Defenseman Keith Carney logged 28 minutes and 28
seconds. Teppo Numminen, who's playing but is still suffering pain
and stiffness from a fractured foot, logged 27:06, and Deron Quint
and Oleg Tverdovsky each played more than 23 minutes as Schoenfeld
chose to spot play Jamie Huscroft and Brad Tiley to provide brief
relief.
</P>
<P>
   In their last meeting in Phoenix, Red Wings left wing Brendan
Shanahan celebrated three times as he registered a hat trick.
</P>
<P>
   Those were scenes the Coyotes' Numminen doesn't want to see
repeated.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you see someone celebrating like that, you know it has
been a long night,'' Numminen said. ``You find yourself saying, `Do
it somewhere else, please, but not here.'
</P>
<P>
   ``But they have so much talent and so many good skaters that if
you don't play your best game and shut them down in the neutral
zone, they will really take it to you. It's not just the one line
they have. They have four good lines, which makes it important we
play good defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Numminen, who owns the second longest active regular-season
consecutive game streak in the NHL with 282, said maintaining the
streak has not been a factor in playing through the foot injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``The streak doesn't matter, really,'' he said. ``Actually, I've
had no choice but to play because we have so many people out. Had
the situation been different, maybe I would have made a different
choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when Jyrki went down it left us without a big offensive
threat on defense, so I had to play. It gets sore and stiff, but I
try not to think about it.''
</P>
<P>
   General Manager Bobby Smith took a load off the Coyotes'
shoulder by ending speculation before Monday's game that
Schoenfeld's job was in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody _ players and coaches _ is used to it at this time
of year,'' forward Mike Sullivan said. ``The demand is for
everybody to win games right now, and if you don't, everyone's job
is at stake. It's part of the territory, and you cope and handle it
the best you can.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Shoney has done nothing to lose his job. It's the 20 guys
in this room who lace up their skates and ultimately decide the
team's fate. Every game is important now, but it's most important
we get back to playing to our potential. If we do that, the wins
and losses will take care of themselves.'' &QL;

SETTLEMENT REACHED WITH TRAINERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRANK C. GIRARDOT  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The California Horse Racing Board and the state Attorney
General's office reached a settlement Tuesday with three trainers
who had horses test positive for the steroid clenbuterol.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the trainers was fined $1,500 by the board. Four related
cases remain unsettled.
</P>
<P>
   Trainers Vladmir Cerin, Peter Eurton and Declan Jackson agreed
to the sanction through their attorney Robert Forgnone. Deputy
Attorney General Dana Cartozian, represented the CHRB, said
spokesman Mike Marten.
</P>
<P>
   The accusations were filed against Cerin, Eurton and Jackson
last September after clenbuterol, a steroid that clears breathing
passages in short-of-breath horses, was detected in urine samples.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's cases were settled at Forgnone's request.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have six cases in this,'' Forgnone said. ``Now we're working
on the other three.''
</P>
<P>
   Testing positive were the Cerin-trained Ruhlman's Opus and
Jackson's Speedball, on June 10, 1998; and Eurton's The Smokester,
a June 14 winner.
</P>
<P>
   All three have been disqualified by the CHRB, Forgnone said.
Their owners must return any prize monies they earned.
</P>
<P>
   Hearings for other trainers in the case are still scheduled,
Marten said. Paco Gonzales will go before the court May 24. Darrell
Vienna and Bruce Headley will be heard June 7. Ted West's case is
scheduled to be heard June 14, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Forgnone also represents Vienna, Headley and West.
</P>
<P>
   Among the horses testing positive was Free House, currently the
NTRA's No.1 ranked thoroughbred.

THUMB INJURY SETS BACK PROSPECT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON KETCHUM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON _ The Diamondbacks thought they had used enough repellant
to not be affected by the injury bug, but they were wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Second baseman  &UR; Junior Spivey, one of the organization's
promising young players, will be out for 8-10 weeks because of torn
ligaments in his left thumb.
</P>
<P>
   The 24-year-old Spivey, who is expected to play at either
Triple-A Tucson or Double-A El Paso in 1999, suffered the injury
during a pre-game workout Monday at Tucson Electric Park. He is
scheduled to have surgery Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was diving after a ground ball and just landed wrong on my
glove hand,'' said Spivey, who is a member of the 40-man roster and
had two hits in seven at-bats this spring. ``I was feeling pretty
good about the way I was playing, but now I don't feel too good.
I'll just have to try to keep my spirits up.'' &QL; 
Johnson maintains pace &QL; 
Left-hander  &UR; Randy Johnson gave up a bunt single to the Chicago
White Sox's &UR; McKay Christensen to lead off the bottom of the first
Tuesday, but gave up no hits thereafter in four innings of work. He
walked one and struck out five.
</P>
<P>
   The highlight was two strikeouts of slugger  &UR; Frank Thomas, the
first time on a breaking ball and the second time on an inside
fastball.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is pleased with the way his slider is developing,
particularly at this point in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``My fastball is obviously my strength, but you can't go out
there and throw 125 fastballs,'' Johnson said. ``You have to be
able to have another pitch to set that up, and mine is the breaking
ball. I thought I threw that pitch pretty well today. It seems to
be coming around.''
</P>
<P>
   He threw 58 pitches Tuesday and topped out at 98 mph. Pitching
coach  &UR; Mark
 &UR; Connor said Johnson likely will throw 75 pitches in his next start
Sunday, followed by about 90 and 100-105 in his last two starts,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to get at least seven or eight innings in my last
start (March 31),'' Johnson said. ``The stronger your body gets,
the more confident you become.''
</P>
<P>
   Another goal for Johnson is to get some more at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've only had one this spring, and that was a walk (by the
Chicago Cubs'
 &UR; Jon Lieber),'' Johnson said. ``I need to get some more swings.''
</P>
<P>
   He told Manager  &UR; Buck Showalter that before Tuesday's game, and
Showalter muttered under his breath, ``Don't worry about it, big
guy. Just throw the ball over the plate.'' &QL; 
Short stops &QL; 
Outfielders  &UR; Jason Conti and  &UR; Rob Ryan were optioned to Triple-A
Tucson. More moves could be coming over the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   Outfielder  &UR; Bernard Gilkey, out since March 7 with a strained
left calf, is expected to return to action Thursday against Oakland
at Tucson Electric Park.
</P>
<P>
   Showalter was pleased with the pitching effort of left-hander
 &UR; Troy Brohawn, who made his first start of the spring and gave up
one run on three hits, walked one and struck out two against
Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing action in the outfield for the White Sox in the
split-squad game was  &UR; Scott Lydy, a graduate of Mesa Mountain View
High School who began his career in the Oakland organization. &QL;

EDITORIAL: MISCHIEF FROM MR. GRAMM 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, March 17:
</P>
<P>
   Cities that were in drastic decline 20 years ago are
experiencing rebirth, thanks to new homeowners who are transforming
neighborhoods of transients into places where families have a stake
in what happens. The renaissance is due in part to the Federal
Community Reinvestment Act, which requires banks to reinvest
actively in depressed and minority areas that were historically
written off. Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas now wants to weaken the
Reinvestment Act, encouraging a return to the bad old days, when
banks took everyone's deposits but lent them only to the affluent.
Sensible members of Congress need to keep the measure intact.
</P>
<P>
   The act was passed in 1977. Until then, prospective home or
business owners in many communities had little chance of landing
loans even from banks where they kept money on deposit. But
according to the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, banks
have committed more than $1 trillion to once-neglected
neighborhoods since the act was passed, the vast majority of it in
the last six years.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City's South Bronx neighborhood, the money has
turned burned-out areas into havens for affordable homes and a new
middle class. The banks earn less on community-based loans than on
corporate business. But the most civic-minded banks have accepted
this reduced revenue as a cost of doing business _ and as a
reasonable sacrifice for keeping the surrounding communities
strong.
</P>
<P>
   Federal bank examiners can block mergers or expansions for banks
that fail to achieve a satisfactory Community Reinvestment Act
rating. The Senate proposal that Gramm supports would exempt banks
with assets of less than $100 million from their obligations under
the act. That would include 65 percent of all banks. The Senate
bill would also dramatically curtail the community's right to
expose what it considers unfair practices. Without Federal
pressure, however, the amount of money flowing to poorer
neighborhoods would drop substantially, undermining the urban
recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm argues that community groups are ``extorting'' money from
banks in return for approval, and describes the required paperwork
as odious. But community organizations that build affordable
housing in Gramm's home state heartily disagree. Mayor Ron Kirk of
Dallas disagrees as well, and told The Dallas Morning News that he
welcomed the opportunity to explain to Gramm that ``there is no
downside to investing in all parts of our community.''
</P>
<P>
   In a perfect world, lending practices would be fair and the
Reinvestment Act would be unnecessary. But without Federal pressure
the country would return to the era of redlining, when communities
cut off from capital withered and died.  &QL;

CARLSON MAKES PITCH FOR D-BACKS JOB  
 RIGHT-HANDER THROWING WELL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON KETCHUM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON _ The race for spots in the Diamondbacks' middle-relief
corps continues to be wide-open, and right-hander Dan Carlson is
right in the middle of it.
</P>
<P>
   If Carlson's name rings a bell, it should. He pitched for the
San Francisco Giants' Triple-A affiliate in Phoenix for parts of
five seasons, winning 13 on three occasions, before going to Tampa
Bay in the expansion draft.
</P>
<P>
   He struggled in 10 games with the Devil Rays and again at
Triple-A Durham before hooking on with Arizona as a minor-league
free agent and non-roster invitee to the spring camp.
</P>
<P>
   The 29-year-old Carlson has appeared in four games for the
Diamondbacks this spring and given up three hits in 5 innings.
</P>
<P>
   He is scheduled to pitch two more innings today against the
Chicago Cubs at HoHoKam Park in Mesa, following right-hander Todd
Stottlemyre and right-hander Frank Castillo (a former Cub) and
preceding right-hander Vladimir Nunez.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew the Diamondbacks had scouted me for the expansion
draft, so I was surprised when Tampa took me instead,'' said
Carlson, who was in Australia participating in Christian baseball
clinics when he received the news in November of 1997. ``Things
didn't work out in Tampa, so coming here was my No. 1 goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you come into a camp as a non-roster guy, you're
sometimes lucky if you get to throw once in a `B' game. But I've
already pitched five innings in four games, and I can honestly say
that they've really given me a chance. I think I've pitched well so
far, but I have to continue to do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is competition, but for me, it's competition against the
hitter. You have to worry about getting him out. You can't play GM
(general manager) and worry about what the other pitchers are
doing''.
</P>
<P>
   Carlson's success this spring has come with his slider and the
refinement of his sinker pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sinker, especially,'' Carlson said. ``I'm not the type of
guy who has a 95 mph heater. I have success by keeping ahead in the
count and using my location.''
</P>
<P>
   Diamondbacks pitching coach Mark Connor said Carlson ``is right
there'' in the battle for a middle-relief spot.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Buck Showalter said he ``has opened some eyes. He's been
impressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Carlson, Diamondbacks third baseman Matt Williams grew up
in the San Francisco organization. Though Williams is a bit older
(33), the two crossed paths on many occasions.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a guy that you wouldn't know was there, not flashy, just
the type of guy who goes out and gives it everything he has,''
Williams said. ``He has good stuff. A good slider and a fastball
that moves in pretty good on the right-handed hitters. He's the
type of guy you want to root for to make the club.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlson, who was a third baseman early in his career at Mt. Hood
(Ore.) Junior College and then became a pitcher, was a starter
during most of his minor-league career. When he was called up to
the majors, he was used in relief. He knows that's where he has the
best chance to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a different mentality, to be sure,'' he said. ``I've sat
a couple times for anywhere from eight to 13 days before getting up
to throw. But you have to be ready all the time. You have to
prepare the same way every day.''
</P>
<P>
   While he thinks he would be a good fit on what he calls a
quality staff, he also knows he could end up playing here for the
Triple-A Sidewinders this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't be disappointed, not at all,'' he said. ``If I come
down here and pitch well, I could get called back up at some
point.'' &QL;

CUBS LEAD SURGE IN CACTUS CROWDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LES POLK  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Cactus League attendance is up 19 percent this year
over 1998, spurred by Sammy Sosa fever, better weather and the
major leagues coming off a banner season.
</P>
<P>
   Through Monday's games, Sosa's team, the Chicago Cubs, who play
in Mesa, were leading the major leagues in spring attendance,
averaging 11,326 per game, a 34 percent increase over last year.
The Cubs are expecting more than 12,000 fans at today's game in
Mesa against the Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs have taken the major league spring attendance lead away
from the New York Yankees, who are averaging 10,256 this season and
led the majors last year.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Cactus League has four of the top five teams in
spring attendance, according to Major League Baseball figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's starting off really well,'' said Robert Brinton, who
heads the Mesa Convention and Visitors Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Brinton said he thinks the Cubs will break 1997's season
attendance mark of 157,000. And in one less home game, 15 vs. 16.
</P>
<P>
   The other four teams in the Cactus League who are in baseball's
top five this spring include the San Francisco Giants (averaging
8,121, up 33 percent), Seattle Mariners (8,022, up 32 percent) and
the Diamondbacks (7,845, up 20 percent).
</P>
<P>
   The only team down in average attendance is the Milwaukee
Brewers. However, team officials said earlier this month that
advance sales for the month of March were ahead of last year and
that they expect to finish ahead of last year's figures. &QL;

SUNS LIKE FANS' BOOS IN ROUTING BUCKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ The Suns heard the booing again Tuesday night. And
this time they loved every bit of it. For a change, it wasn't aimed
at them.
</P>
<P>
   With the Suns playing some of their best basketball of the
season, leading by 32 points in the first half on the road, and en
route to a 110-92 drubbing of the Milwaukee Bucks, the Bradley
Center fans gave their team an earful.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know what that feels like,'' Suns guard Jason Kidd said.
</P>
<P>
   They also know what it feels like to win on the road. The
victory, which came so easily Kidd didn't need a triple double or
even to play in the fourth quarter, was the seventh in 10 road
games this season for the Suns. They're just 5-7 on their
homecourt.
</P>
<P>
   It's a quirk that's hard to figure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our fans must be (ticked) off,'' said forward Tom Gugliotta,
who scored 19 points and took down seven rebounds in the victory.
``I think we're just more alert at the beginning of the game on the
road. It's a natural tendency on someone else's court.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know you can't afford to get into a hole. On our court, we
haven't had that same approach. Hopefully, we can learn from this
and understand what it takes.''
</P>
<P>
   The Suns, who won their last home game against Houston, got off
to a good start on a four-game road trip that continues tonight in
Charlotte. And they did it with an impressive all-around
performance.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix shot 53.5 percent, moved the ball offensively as well as
the Suns have all season, pounded the Bucks on the backboards,
43-27, and, beat them in transition. Clifford Robinson led six Suns
who scored in double figures with 20 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they showed signs of three-game fatigue,'' Suns Coach
Danny Ainge said.
</P>
<P>
   It was Milwaukee's third game in three nights, but the Bucks
also are a team in transition. The Bucks had won six straight games
and had a record of 12-5 before they worked two trades to move
disgruntled point guard Terrell Brandon and obtain point guard Sam
Cassell from New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble is, Cassell is out for at least 10 days because of a
bone chip discovered in his ankle. And since the deal, the Bucks
have lost four in a row.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like the first exhibition game of the season, we got to look
at a lot of people and play a lot of people,'' Bucks Coach George
Karl said. ``We just had a gone game.''
</P>
<P>
   Forward Glenn Robinson had another way of putting it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just got our (butts) kicked,'' he said. ``We have to stop
the bleeding, keep our heads up and play like we did six or seven
games ago.''
</P>
<P>
   The Suns looked like a whole new team, too. A better one.
</P>
<P>
   They were advertised as a club loaded with unselfish, skilled
passers at every position. But the blowout of the Bucks provided
the first real glimpse of that potential.
</P>
<P>
   It was particularly evident in the first half when the Suns ran,
shared th e ball, moved in their halfcourt sets and made extra
passes to find an open shooter.
</P>
<P>
   The result was 65-percent shooting in the first quarter and a
33-15 Phoenix lead. The Suns had to know they were in good shape
with that kind of output when Kidd had only one first-quarter
assist. But eight other players had at least one as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got guys who can pass and guys who are comfortable at
different positions,'' Gugliotta said. ``That should be a huge
asset. Guys were moving the ball, looking for each other, and
everything was flowing.''
</P>
<P>
   The onslaught continued in the second quarter as the Suns built
their lead to as much as 32. They lost interest during a few
stretches in the second half, but coasted down the stretch with
rookies Toby Bailey, Pat Garrity and Gerald Brown all in the game
together.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're at our best when everyone touches the ball and makes the
extra pass,'' Kidd said. ``In the first quarter, everybody had
their hands on the ball. Everybody made the extra passes. It was a
great way to open the road trip.''
</P>
<P>
   Ainge agreed the ball movement was critical, but the Suns were
moving, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing to move the ball, but if the bodies are
standing still it doesn't make any difference if you make the extra
pass,'' Ainge said. ``When they double-down (defensively), we were
getting good passing and slashing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Suns were equally effective in the open court and, with Kidd
running the break, they took the ball to the basket against a
Milwaukee lineup that's short on shotblockers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Running was their biggest asset,'' Milwaukee guard Ray Allen
said. ``They beat us back, got fouled and dictated the course of
the game.'' &QL;

FORMER TIMES BUILDING IS NAMED A LANDMARK 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A craggy, Romanesque tower in lower Manhattan where
all the news became fit to print was designated a New York City
landmark on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The 16-story building at 41 Park Row was the home of The New
York Times until 1904, when the newspaper moved to Times Square. It
has been owned since 1951 by Pace University, which uses it for
classrooms and offices.
</P>
<P>
   Once part of a powerful trio towering over City Hall Park _ the
nearby World Building and Tribune Building were demolished long ago
_ 41 Park Row was designed by George B. Post and completed in 1889.
It resembles an elongated Roman aqueduct, with row upon row of
vigorous arches carved from Maine granite and Indiana limestone.
</P>
<P>
   ``So beautiful that it charms the naive and the refined, the
ignorant and the most learned in art; the Times Building is The New
York Times expressed in stone,'' Moses King declared in his 1893
guide book to New York City.
</P>
<P>
   It was at 41 Park Row that Adolph S. Ochs arrived from
Chattanooga in 1896, finding an anemic publication with a
circulation of 9,000. After he bought The Times, Ochs added the
motto, ``All the News That's Fit to Print,'' first to the editorial
page, then to the front page, where it remains.
</P>
<P>
   Even before The Times moved uptown, the architect Robert
Maynicke planned alterations that left 41 Park Row much as one sees
it today. The mansard roof was removed and three floors were added.
The entrance lost the inscription ``Times Bvilding'' but kept an
ornamental clock with Roman numerals and Gothic hands.

L.A. VISA RING LINKED TO TERRORISTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY PETER HARTLAUB AND GREG GITTRICH  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ An immigration fraud ring suspected of trying to
help members of Iran's most notorious terrorist group enter the
United States was shut down Tuesday with 29 arrests, authorities
said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said Bahram Tabatabai of Sherman Oaks ran the ring
out of a Ventura Boulevard office building with 14 other people,
charging hundreds of immigrants up to $12,000 for fake visa and
asylum applications. Court documents say they forged documents
including birth certificates and even newspaper articles to help
immigrants who wouldn't typically be let into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   According to prosecutors, some of those who applied for
political asylum under the scheme were actually members of
Mujahedin-e Khalq, an Iranian terrorist organization suspected in
the takeover in 1979 of the U.S. embassy in Tehran and now closely
allied with Saddam Hussein in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney Alejandro Mayorkas declined to say whether many of
the group's members entered the country or how many were involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have taken a step toward preventing people identified as
terrorists from coming into this country,'' Mayorkas said. ``The
evidence suggests hundreds of applications were processed
throughout the past year.''
</P>
<P>
   Tabatabai and 14 others _ many of whom lived in L.A.'s San
Fernando Valley _ were arrested without incident Tuesday and
charged with conspiracy, submitting false statements to the
Immigration and Naturalization Service and trafficking in
fraudulent identity documents.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen others were arrested Tuesday by INS officials on
suspicion of entering the country illegally with the help of the
fraud ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I emphasize that they have not been charged with a terrorist
act,'' said FBI Assistant Director Timothy McNally. He said
attempts to help known terrorists ``draws big questions as to what
their motivations are.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for the defendants could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The terrorist group is considered the Iranian government's
primary opposition and has waged a series of terrorist attacks on
the country's Islamic leaders and their allies for two decades.
</P>
<P>
   Now based in Iraq and working closely with Saddam Hussein, the
group is believed to be a key player in the takeover of the United
States embassy in 1979, according to University of Southern
California professor Richard Dekmejian, an expert on Middle Eastern
politics and terrorist groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Much of its strength comes from Iraq. Saddam Hussein is its
major benefactor,'' Dekmejian said. ``They are spread out in
European capitals and have significant military forces in Iraq.
Every so often, they mount attacks across the Iranian border with
support from the Iraqi government.''
</P>
<P>
   The Iranian government has demanded repeatedly that the United
States crack down on the group, which prompted the State Department
in 1997 to begin listing the group as one of 30 international
terrorist organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Tabatabai is the head of International Management Network,
located in the 16600 block of Ventura Boulevard, according to court
papers. The company advertised in foreign newspapers, offering to
help immigrants in the Middle East and Europe obtain temporary and
permanent visas.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, FBI and INS agents meticulously searched Tabatabai's
Encino offices on Ventura Boulevard, his home in Sherman Oaks and
Encino-based Tehran International Weekly Magazine.
</P>
<P>
   According to employees at Worldwide Electronic Bankcard Corp.,
which is located across the hallway from Tabatabai's office, about
40 federal agents and police quietly entered the office around 8
a.m. Later in the day, several people unsuspectingly knocked on the
office door and were searched and detained by the agents, the
witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   Residents in the 14600 block of Morrison Street where Tabatabai
lives peeked out windows and gawked as federal agents packed boxes
into a white moving van.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first I thought it involved stolen cars or auto parts
because he always had fancy cars coming in and out. I couldn't
believe it when I heard terrorists,'' said one resident. ``It's
scary and not a normal thing to see around here.''
</P>
<P>
   In October 1996, a confidential informant who worked out of the
business began cooperating with investigators. More information was
gathered by a second informant and an undercover police officer.
</P>
<P>
   Among those arrested was Shahbod Noori, editor of Tehran
International Weekly, who is accused of placing fake newspaper
advertisements and articles to promote the fraud.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, prosecutors allege, Noori's paper ran an
advertisement for an art exhibit that didn't exist, so
International Management customers could get temporary tourist
visas citing plans to attend the event.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said the defendants forged college transcripts,
military records and bank records and would create new identities
for clients with U.S. arrest records or those who had been rejected
for asylum.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fair to say that this immigration fraud ring was a little
more sophisticated than the usual,'' said Assistant U.S. Attorney
Kenneth White.

PLAY IT AGAIN, SAMMY: SOSA HAS NOTHING, EVERYTHING TO PROVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MESA, Ariz. _ The co-savior of the national pastime is
dispensing one-liners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sammy, a moment of your time,'' the foghorn-voiced fan behind
the dugout bellows.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are you, my neighbor?'' Sammy replies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sammy, who's the best player in the game right now?'' the
radio guy asks in the crowded, postgame news conference that's
become a daily ritual at the Chicago Cubs' spring-training camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael Jordan,'' Sammy quips.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone laughs heartily.
</P>
<P>
   When you're Sammy Sosa, and you've engaged Mark McGwire in a
thrilling duel for the single-season home-run record, a duel
credited with resurrecting an entire sport, even your lame jokes
get the same kind of response as a Jerry Seinfeld zinger.
</P>
<P>
   But seriously, folks.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa is well aware of what he and McGwire did last year. McGwire
hit 70 homers and got the record. Sosa hit 66 homers, but also
batted .308, drove in 158 runs, and got the National League
most-valuable-player award.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of the home-run chase was brought home in dramatic
fashion when he was watching a tribute to Joe DiMaggio. The magical
summer of '98 was compared to the summer of '41, when DiMaggio hit
in 56 consecutive games and Ted Williams batted .406.
</P>
<P>
   ``That year, everybody paid a lot of attention to Joe
DiMaggio,'' Sosa said. ``The same thing happened last year with
Mark and I. Everybody was looking at the sports stations to see
what Sammy did, or what Mark did. We made a lot of people happy,
and baseball was forgiven a little bit. Now, everybody's excited,
and I hope we do it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, that's the tricky part.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa enters the season with nothing to prove. He passed Roger
Maris' 37-year-old home run record by five. His RBI total was the
highest in the NL since 1928.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've done everything a player could ask for,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, he has everything to prove. He has raised the
bar so high that to return to pre-1998 levels, say the 36 homers
and 119 runs batted in of '97, might be seen as a disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   Cubs manager Jim Riggleman knows that 1998 was a season for the
ages and that Sosa isn't likely to duplicate it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not looking for any particular numbers,'' Riggleman
said. ``It's such a game of statistics that I know the fans will
be, and the rotisserie leagues will be, so it will be an issue
externally. Internally, I don't think it will be. If you told me
Sammy will have an average Sammy Sosa year, I'd take it right now.
Whatever those numbers are, I'd take it.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Sosa's first full season with the Cubs in 1993, those
numbers are 39 homers and 110 RBI. Most players would take those
numbers, but most players aren't coming off a 66-homer, 158-RBI
season.
</P>
<P>
   With pitcher Kerry Wood, the 1998 rookie of the year, out for
the season, Sosa becomes even more valuable. It's hard to see the
Cubs getting back to the playoffs without Wood, even if Sosa has
another 66-homer season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll keep Sammy on the field, put a glass case around him,''
said Cubs reliever Rod Beck.
</P>
<P>
   But Riggleman wants to guard against Sosa pressing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Internally, we have subtly let Sammy know just go play,''
Riggleman said. ``Hopefully he'll have an injury-free year again,
and when you look up at the end of September it's going to have
been a real good year. His physical talent will take care of
that.''
</P>
<P>
   That talent is on display in spring training. Sosa's second
preseason homer was a mammoth shot that easily would have been all
the way out of Wrigley Field. He has five home runs, leaving him
tied with (you guessed it) McGwire for the spring lead.
</P>
<P>
   But also on display is a little extra weight around the thighs,
rear and waist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a few extra pounds,'' Sosa admitted.
</P>
<P>
   That can happen when you live large in the off-season.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa joined President Clinton at the White House for the
lighting of the national Christmas tree. He sat with the first lady
at the state of the union address. He presented a bat to New York
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. He made appearances, went to banquets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sixty-six is a lot of home runs,'' he said. ``A lot of people
wanted to shake my hand; a lot of people needed me to go and spend
some time with them. It was like a holiday to me. I was having
fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he did find time to work out, and the extra weight seems
more firm than flabby.
</P>
<P>
   ``In spring training, almost all of the players come in
overweight,'' he said. ``For me it's not overnight. It's just a
little bit of muscle. I feel great. I feel physically and mentally
strong, and I can handle it.''
</P>
<P>
   Riggleman says he isn't worried about Sosa's condition,
physically or mentally. He says he knew that despite all the
off-season distractions, Sosa would arrive in camp ready to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``His goal last year was to get us to the postseason, first
ahead of everything else,'' Riggleman said. ``I know he feels that
way this year. But he's also got some long-term goals that don't
allow you to relax too much. His long-term goals don't allow for
any down periods. He will always be pushing it.''
</P>
<P>
   The reminders of 1998 are everywhere, from the constant
attention of the fans, to the camera crew filming his every move in
and around the batting cage, to the constant references to ``last
year.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sosa already is trying to forget.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody will remember 1998,'' he said. ``But I have to put
that away. They paid me for last year already. I have to come back
and do my job in 1999.''
</P>
<P>
   He sees his job as taking the Cubs to the postseason again, but
beyond the first round this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing that I've missed is going to a World Series,''
he said. ``That's my thinking right now. I'm going to hit a lot of
home runs; everybody knows that. But I want to make it to the World
Series.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Cubs to make it back to the playoffs, let alone the
World Series, Sosa is going to have to hit a lot of home runs and
drive in a lot of runs again.
</P>
<P>
   He has nothing to prove, and he has everything to prove.
</P>
<P>
   ``After it happened last year, I say to myself nothing is
impossible,'' Sosa said. ``I'm not saying it's going to happen
again, but I feel great. I believe in myself. I'm going to do
everything I can, go out there and do my job, and take the club to
the playoffs if I can.'' nn

KNICKS DEFEAT CLIPPERS, 113-89
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By STEVE POPPER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ By the fourth quarter on Tuesday night, with fans
emptying out of the stands at about the same rate the coaches were
emptying their benches, the Knicks showed in one glittering play
all that they could be.
</P>
<P>
   A steal, Chris Dudley throwing an unlikely over-the-shoulder
outlet pass, Chris Childs making an unselfish assist and Kurt
Thomas swooping to the basket for an uncontested dunk. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As the ball ripped through the basket, Thomas also shredded the
net, leaving it dangling. On the bench, Allan Houston and Larry
Johnson covered their faces with towels to suppress their laughter.
With the net hanging down in pieces, Madison Square Garden
resembled a forgotten playground. Perhaps making that fact more
evident was the opposition, the Los Angeles Clippers, a team that
would have a hard time getting next on any court in the city. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The basket, which came as part of an early burst in the fourth
quarter, helped put the Clippers out of their misery for the 20th
time in 21 games this season. The Knicks began the game with a 14-0
run and only had to wait for the 48 minutes to tick off the clock
before putting a 113-89 victory in the books, their most lopsided
triumph of the season.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It gave the Knicks three victories in three nights, making them
the fifth team in the National Basketball Association this season
to win on back-to-back-to-back nights. The Knicks never appeared
tired, though, raising the lead to as many as 32 points in the
fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Latrell Sprewell enjoyed the easy run, scoring 31 points off the
bench, his high as a Knick, one night after scoring 28 in
Milwaukee. Houston added 24 points and Johnson chipped in 20 before
they became spectators in the opening minute of the fourth quarter,
the second straight game that the three topped the 20-point mark. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The victory had Knicks Coach Jeff Van Gundy, as close to giddy
as he might get, joking: ``We've played three excellent games in a
row. I wish we could play again tomorrow.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While he might get an argument from his players, who will get a
well-deserved and much-needed day off on Wednesday, the starters
could have begun their rest after the opening minutes as the Knicks
raced to a 19-2 lead. They never trailed as they topped the century
mark for the second consecutive night.
</P>
<P>
   The strain of three games in three nights took its toll on
Johnson, who an hour after the game remained on the trainer's table
receiving treatment, unavailable to the news media. A team
spokesman said he had not been injured.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel great and I think everyone else feels the same,''
Sprewell said. ``We're on a roll right now. We want to come out and
play well, especially after a good road win. We feel good about
ourselves right now.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If the lowly Clippers offered the opportunity for a letdown, the
Knicks avoided that by crushing the visitors' hopes almost as soon
as the opening tip was won. While the Knicks have denied that Van
Gundy's job was tenuous, he presumably recalled that he got the
position three years ago this month, two days after Don Nelson
ended his tenure in New York by losing at home to the Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   With Los Angeles entering this game with a 1-19 mark, a home
loss could have erased any assurances that his position was safe.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy stressed the danger in a walk-through that the Knicks
conducted just two hours before the start of the game. He made
comparisons between the Nets and the Clippers and let his players
know that if they consider the Nets a dangerous opponent, then the
Clippers should be regarded that way, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight could have been a night where we let one slip away,''
Van Gundy said. ``Other than a little slip in the second quarter, I
thought we really took care of business.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If the Clippers look like a playground grouping that never met
before the game, the Knicks looked like Princeton on a good night,
scoring the first 14 points and starting it with four consecutive
3-point field goals. The lead stretched to 19-2 over the first
seven minutes, with Johnson scoring 11 points in the run, before
the Clippers inched back in, closing the gap to 31-21 at the end of
the quarter.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers got as close as 6 in the second quarter, with
Maurice Taylor scoring almost at will against Marcus Camby. But the
Knicks opened it up again, this time thanks to the work of
Sprewell, who scored 18 points in the quarter. By halftime, the
lead was 59-42.

STRICKLAND GETS CHANCE WHILE PACK IS SIDELINED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ He was planted at the end of the bench early in the
season, then placed on the injured list, and had become the
Mavericks' forgotten guard.
</P>
<P>
   But with Robert Pack sidelined two to four weeks with a slightly
torn right hamstring, Erick Strickland's importance to the
Mavericks has increased immensely, coach Don Nelson said.
Strickland and Hubert Davis can expect to play more minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Seizing the moment, Strickland scored 13 points in 11 minutes
during Monday's 106-91 loss to Portland. The third-year guard made
5 of 8 shots from the field and collected two assists and two
rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pleased that I got back to my aggressiveness, attacking
and pushing the ball,'' Strickland said. ``They mostly have been
playing me at (shooting guard) lately, but I took it upon myself to
get the ball more and push it and try to create shots for the other
guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Strickland didn't play in 15 of the Mavericks' 23 games,
including the four games before Monday.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Nelson sounded pleased about Strickland's performance
against the Trail Blazers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Erick Strickland stepped up, without playing for a long time,
and played a very fine game,'' Nelson said. ``So, good for him.''
</P>
<P>
   With Pack out, Strickland knows this is an opportunity to show
the coaching staff what he can do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if I go in and be solid I may get more of a chance to
play,'' he said. TRENT THANKFUL
</P>
<P>
   Gary Trent, who is scheduled to become a free agent July 1, has
said he will strongly consider re-signing with the Mavericks. His
agent is echoing those sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gary's really wanted to be in a situation where he can get
some playing time and be with an organization that appreciates what
he can do as a frontline player,'' agent Mark Termini said. ``It
looks like this situation is evolving into that, and that's real
big in our minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``So everything is very positive as far as the Dallas situation
goes. But no decisions have been made either way, and certainly no
doors have been closed about Gary coming back to Dallas.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the NBA's collective bargaining agreement, the most the
Mavericks can offer Trent is a one-year, $2 million contract.
Mavericks officials said they expect five or six teams to be under
the salary cap this summer, and any could offer Trent a more
lucrative long-term contract. EXTRA WORK
</P>
<P>
   Nelson gave every player Tuesday off except Samaki Walker, Chris
Anstey and Dirk Nowitzki. Those three players were first-round
draft picks the past three seasons. nn

OFF-SEASON INSTRUCTION BENEFITS ZAUN
</HEADLINE>
 NOTES-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRADENTON, Fla. _ Catcher Gregg Zaun, who resides in Weston,
Fla., moved to Arlington in mid-January to become a pupil of
Rangers hitting instructor Rudy Jaramillo.
</P>
<P>
   Zaun sees a better hitter two months later.
</P>
<P>
   The switch-hitter strengthened his bid to become the Rangers'
backup catcher with Tuesday's performance in the Rangers' 10-5
victory against the Pittsburgh Pirates.
</P>
<P>
   Zaun went 3-for-4 with a solo home run and two run-scoring
singles to improve his batting average to .400 (6-for-15) this
spring, and he credits Jaramillo for enhancing his ability to
handle off-speed pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Three of Zaun's past four hits came on off-speed pitches. ``I've
never been able to stay back on them during my career before,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Zaun, who enters the season with a career batting average of
.234, received three simple-to-remember checkpoints. Jaramillo
suggested Zaun keep his hands back, plant his front foot earlier
while striding toward the pitcher and stay square to the baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``He makes it as easy as you can make it,'' said Zaun, who once
considered himself a fastball-only hitter. ``I'm putting myself in
a position now to hit a lot of different pitches thrown in a lot of
different locations.''
</P>
<P>
   Zaun sought Jaramillo's help based on the success of Rangers
hitters in recent seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just couldn't ignore the fact that these guys rake,'' Zaun
said. ``There had to be something else to it. These guys are great
hitters, but someone helps them stay consistent.'' PIRATES HIGH ON
MORRIS
</P>
<P>
   Second baseman Warren Morris, whom the Rangers traded with
right-hander Todd Van Poppel to Pittsburgh for right-hander Esteban
Loaiza in July, could be in the Pirates' Opening Day lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we were giving up a good player in Warren Morris,''
Rangers general manager Doug Melvin said earlier this spring.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers acknowledge Morris will likely be a productive
major-league hitter,, but some in the organization expressed
concerns about his defense.
</P>
<P>
   Morris worked extensively with Bill Mazeroski for two weeks this
spring. The Pirates invited the eight-time Gold Glove recipient to
their camp as a special instructor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked good to me,'' Mazeroski said of Morris, who is
competing with Mike Benjamin to become the Pirates' second baseman.
``He's got pretty good actions around the bag, and he has a good
idea of what he is doing. He's a good kid who's willing to learn,
and I think he has a chance to be a good second baseman.'' BULLPEN
STRONG
</P>
<P>
   Danny Patterson threw only 18 pitches to record six outs
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the best I've seen Patty throw this spring,'' manager
Johnny Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson, who allowed only a walk, recorded one strikeout and
induced a ground-ball double play.
</P>
<P>
   Oates also used left-hander Mike Munoz for a late-inning
situational matchup with Brian Giles, a left-handed hitter. Munoz
retired Giles and departed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did what I wanted him to do in a normal game situation,''
Oates said. RANGERS 10, PIRATES 5
</P>
<P>
   Five seventh-inning errors led to the Rangers' six-run inning.
Right fielder Alex Hernandez committed two of the errors, and left
fielder Emil Brown, second baseman Jeff Patzke and first baseman
Kevin Young each committed one. Rangers infielder Jon Shave drove
in one of the six runs with a triple.
</P>
<P>
   At the plate: Pirates starter Francisco Cordova hit shortstop
Royce Clayton and right fielder Juan Gonzalez with pitches during
his erratic first inning. Center fielder Ruben Mateo hit his first
home run of the spring.
</P>
<P>
   On the mound: Aaron Sele threw 59 pitches in his three-inning
appearance. Oates prefers that his pitchers complete an inning with
15.
</P>
<P>
   In the field: Third baseman Rob Sasser started a 5-4-3
ninth-inning double play on a ground ball that bounced high over
his head. The 6-foot-3 Sasser leaped to catch the ball, gathered
his feet and delivered a chest-high throw to second baseman Kelly
Dransfeldt.
</P>
<P>
   On the bases: Mateo broke for second base too early on a
hit-and-run and was caught stealing, nn

   When he transferred from Miami of Ohio to Southwest Missouri
State, Danny Moore was looking for a better situation, a better
fit. The idea of making history _ as an individual and with the
Bears _ wasn't part of the equation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just didn't like the situation, it wasn't working out for
me,'' said Moore, who transferred in 1995 and sat out the 1995-96
season. ``I wasn't getting a lot of playing time. Now, I'm at a
school where we've done something that's never been done before.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore, a senior center, has been an integral part of Southwest
Missouri State's surprising run to the NCAA Tournament's Sweet 16.
He had 39 points and 29 rebounds in the Bears' first two East
Region victories. His ability to score and rebound will be crucial
if 12th-seeded Southwest Missouri State (22-10) has any chance
against top-seeded Duke in Friday's regional semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been incredibly consistent. Great players learn how to do
that,'' Southwest Missouri State coach Steve Alford said of Moore.
``He gives us presence in the middle that good teams have to
have.''
</P>
<P>
   In high school, Moore's team defeated New Castle, Ind., in the
playoffs. New Castle was coached by Sam Alford, whose son Steve had
just taken over as head coach at Southwest Missouri State. Steve
Alford, who hired his father as an assistant, had three scholarship
players. He needed bodies, the bigger and more talented the better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sam Alford knew who I was, he remembered me from high
school,'' Moore said. ``When they heard I was transferring, they
got in touch with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore was unhappy at Miami under Herb Sendek, who is now the
coach at North Carolina State. In Alford's motion offense, the
versatile Moore has found a suitable outlet for his talents.
</P>
<P>
   At 6-foot-11 and 243 pounds, Moore has the ability to score down
low with his back to the basket, and to step away from the
body-banging in the lane and shoot facing the basket.
</P>
<P>
   In Sunday's second-round victory against Tennessee, Moore scored
25 points, including two 3-pointers. Tennessee also made the
unusual _ and, as it turned out, disastrous _ decision of guarding
Moore with a single defender.
</P>
<P>
   ``Danny's a great inside presence,'' Southwest Missouri State
point guard William Fontleroy said. ``The other team has to
double-team Danny. If not, Danny can score with the best of 'em
one-on-one. When he's on his game _ passing, kicking from the
double teams _ that just makes it easier for the rest of us to
score from the outside.''
</P>
<P>
   For his career, Moore has averaged 17 points and six rebounds.
He's the first player in Southwest Missouri State history to lead
the team in scoring and rebounding three consecutive seasons. Also,
he's the only Bear to score at least 500 points in three
consecutive seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Moore and his teammates realize the enormous challenge they face
against Duke. For the third consecutive game, the Bears will be
underdogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to take it serious, but it's not the end of the
world if we lose,'' said Moore, who is from Shelbyville, Ind.
``This is the first time the school's ever gotten this far, be
happy for that. We'll try our hardest, try to win, but if we lose,
we still had a great year.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, in Moore's case, career.

JUDGE DENIES NCAA BID ON ELIGIBILITY ISSUE
</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Confusion reigns and questions abound after the NCAA lost
another battle in court over its eligibility standards for freshmen
athletes.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District judge Ronald Buckwalter on Tuesday denied the
NCAA's request to delay the enforcement of a court order that
stripped the organization of its rules on initial eligibility.
Buckwalter made the original ruling last week, saying the NCAA's
use of standardized test scores was racially and culturally biased.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, NCAA officials said the original ruling would cause
``chaos,'' with more than 300 Division I schools left to make their
own decisions regarding eligibility standards for incoming
athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were advised that there are no initial eligibility
standards. We're awaiting further guidance from the NCAA,'' Big 12
Conference commissioner Kevin Weiberg said. ``I can't ever recall
an issue that has as broad-based an impact as this one.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, each institution will have to rely on its best
judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Buckwalter's ruling, which came about from a suit filed by four
black athletes against the NCAA, eliminated Proposition 16. That
rule, which went into effect Aug. 1, 1996, required a high school
diploma and a minimum grade-point average in 13 core academic
courses, with the GPA contingent on an indexed, sliding scale with
scores on either the SAT or ACT.
</P>
<P>
   Buckwalter's ruling last week only struck down using
standardized tests as minimum requirements, but did not rule out
altogether the use of standardized tests.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA will continue the battle in court. It will seek a stay
from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. It will also
appeal Buckwalter's original ruling. The stay ruling could be
resolved within a week; an appeal could take months.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, the questions are numerous. Tuesday, the NCAA held a
conference call with commissioners. Some time this week, it hopes
to issue guidelines that will answer some questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very complicated and confusing situation,'' said TCU
athletic director Eric Hyman, who spent Tuesday afternoon trying to
find some answers. ``The judge's ruling is clear, but the
ramifications are unnerving, unsettling.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the forseeable future, we're going to go on a case-by-case
decision as far as admitting athletes who we think would be
successful at TCU. That's really all we can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Weiberg said the Big 12 office hasn't fielded many calls from
its schools, but his advice would be to follow the judge's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA board of directors could alleviate some of the
confusion. The organization's highest rule-making group, made up of
presidents and chancellors, plans to meet over the next few weeks.
It will decide whether to adopt interim legislation or try to come
up with another solution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until the NCAA has a chance to put in place interim
legislation, I would say anyone is eligible, subject to each
institution's eligibility and admittance standards,'' Weiberg said.
</P>
<P>
   In its court arguments Tuesday, the NCAA argued that the chaos
created by the ruling and the decision could play havoc with the
men's and women's basketball tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   In his eight-page ruling, Buckwalter said he doubted his ruling
would significantly harm an organization that should be equipped to
handle policing its membership after ``almost 100 years of
administering intercollegiate athletics.''
</P>
<P>
   Technically, student-athletes ineligible under Proposition 16
guidelines are now eligible. However, schools might be wary of
using those players because if the ruling is overturned, those
schools could face forfeiture of games and/or loss of revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the court's denial of our request for a stay, our
membership is left with many unknowns about how to address
eligibility standards,'' NCAA president Cedric Dempsey said. nn

A POLITICIAN WHOSE LEAD WE SHOULD FOLLOW

<TEXT>
<P>
   As the mayor of Waxahachie, Texas, Charles Beatty might not deem
it politically correct to answer to the nickname ``Hatchet.'' But
some 30 years later, he's still Hatchet to me.
</P>
<P>
   In compiling a personal list of the most ferocious hitters ever
seen on a college football field, Chuck Beatty of North Texas State
ranks right at the top, and this dates to the late '60s.
</P>
<P>
   Hatchet was a hatchet while playing the monster position _ half
linebacker, half strong safety _ in a storied era of North Texas
football.
</P>
<P>
   As a bad student with a bad attitude, I was flunking out of NT
the same year (1964) Hatchet entered as a freshman football and
basketball player. With no known educational skills, the only work
available was as a sportswriter for a Dallas newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   A few years later, I was covering a ``Mean Green'' team that
sent an astonishing 12 players to the NFL, including Hall of Famer
Joe Greene. Like Greene, Beatty also ended up with the Pittsburgh
Steelers.
</P>
<P>
   But there was always more to Chuck Beatty than just football.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, I received an invitation to a University of North
Texas (as the Denton school is now known) distinguished alumni
awards dinner. Among those to be honored is Hatchet. The only way I
qualified for attendance was through Beatty, who included me on his
guest list.
</P>
<P>
   And even though we are talking about three decades ago, a
totally different world, there is a parallel here with the latest
controversy in college sports over Proposition 16.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge in Philadelphia opened a sack of snakes last
week by halting the NCAA from using minimum standardized test
scores in freshmen eligibility requirements _ otherwise known as
Prop 16 _ ruling ACTs and SATs are racially biased.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the judge denied the NCAA a stay on that ruling. You
know what _ he might be right. Either way, I'll have to leave that
controversy for the deep thinkers.
</P>
<P>
   But this we all know _ because it's history repeating itself _
what the judge has done is delivered the prey from the mouths of
lions to the teeth of tigers.
</P>
<P>
   Remove admission standards, and a certain number of college
coaches will feed upon the victims. Just use them for athletic
purposes, and then throw them back on Mean Street, never to be
heard from again. The meat-on-the-hoof syndrome will return to
college athletics.
</P>
<P>
   In the '60s, it was prevalent. In the '70s, it mushroomed. And
out of that jungle came a Dexter Manley, who could star on the
football field at Oklahoma State but couldn't read the newspaper
stories written about his gridiron greatness. Manley's plight
became a celebrated case, but it was hardly an isolated incident.
</P>
<P>
   If all jocks, then and now, had only been like Chuck Beatty ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing scared me more,'' Hatchet said Tuesday, ``than the
horror stories of the ex-football player having to try and make
something out of the rest of his life.''
</P>
<P>
   In the days of Texas segregation, Beatty graduated from
Waxahachie Turner High School, and because of his football and
basketball skills, had the opportunity to continue on to NTSU. But
in that era, players had to be players. Scholarships would
disappear quickly if athletic advancement didn't occur.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to sit in the dorm and listen for the suitcases
hitting the sidewalk,'' Beatty said.
</P>
<P>
   As Beatty became a stellar football player, he also became a
focused student. Coming from a small, black high school in
then-rural Texas, Hatchet would today be considered one of the
academic underprivileged the Philadelphia judge exemplified when he
struck down Prop 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I felt like I was prepared for college, and considered
myself a good student,'' Beatty said.
</P>
<P>
   After his senior season, Beatty was only 10 hours away from
completing his degree, although that went on hold when he was
drafted by Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Beatty played there four seasons, went to the St. Louis
Cardinals in 1972, and then played a couple of years in the World
Football League.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the time came to join the real world in '76, I returned
to NT for those 10 hours,'' he said. ``With the rest of my life
staring me in the face, I became a very focused student.''
</P>
<P>
   With a degree in hand, Beatty went to work for the executive
office of the Boy Scouts in Dallas, and has been there 22 years.
Meanwhile, he returned to his Waxahachie roots, was elected to the
City Council in 1995 and then elected mayor two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being mayor is all about priorities,'' he said. ``We are a
fast-growing city of 22,000 that wants to maintain the quality of
life, but also expand in the right directions.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, 53 years old, my man Hatchet has come a long way from old
Waxahachie Turner and NTSU. This mixing of athletics and academics
can work for all, provided certain coaches aren't given too many
athletics-only temptations. nn

RAPTORS BEAT NETS, 100-85 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   TORONTO _ The smiles worn by John Calipari's enemies in the New
Jersey Nets' organization turned to grimaces and frowns tonight. In
a display that was as shocking as their 3-18 record, the Nets were
run out of Air Canada Center by the Toronto Raptors.
</P>
<P>
   A day after Calipari was fired by the team's principal owner,
Lewis Katz, the Nets were blasted, 100-85, by a young and
undisciplined squad with an 8-12 record. In was the Nets' eighth
straight loss and the 14th in their last 15 over all.
</P>
<P>
   With the interim coach Don Casey calling the plays, little
changed. The Nets shot air balls and bricks, used paper-thin
defense and seemed confused.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Raptors dunked with style, blocked shots with
authority and mocked their wretched guests with a host of arrogant
mannerisms on the court. It was so bad that the usually mellow
Casey stomped his feet in disgust at the 4-minute-16-second mark of
the third quarter when the Nets were trailing by 62-48.
</P>
<P>
   The act was the most demonstrative one of the night for the
61-year-old Casey, who looked almost like a Calipari clone. As the
Nets missed open shot after open shot in shooting 37 percent from
the field, Casey frantically ran his fingers through his hair,
screamed orders and turned his back on the action in dismay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm saying to myself, `Boy, what a seat this is when you move
over 12 inches and walk in somebody else's shoes,''' Casey said.
``You look bad when you miss shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Jayson Williams, who grabbed 14 rebounds but missed four of five
shots, was able to keep a sense of humor about the situation.
``Casey's got to be careful, stomping his feet at that age,''
Williams said. ``The bones are fragile. The heart is weak. I don't
want to go through three coaches in two days.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nets melted like a snowman on a sunny day. They never had a
lead and, after shooting 17 percent in the second quarter, trailed
by as many as 19 points before halftime. The open shots they got
because of Casey's new plays went for naught as they made just 6 of
26 shots (23 percent) in the third quarter and watched the Raptors
open the lead to 27 points. Clearly, Calipari and his three deposed
assistants _ Johnny Davis, Kenny Gattison and Jack Haley _were not
the only problem with the free-falling Nets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a new start, but it's been a long week,'' said Kendall
Gill, who missed 7 of 11 shots and scored 14 points. ``We're trying
to play hard for Casey, for ourselves and for the organization,
but. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   In a scene that was reminiscent of Sunday's events in Miami,
where Calipari toiled under the critical eyes of the club's
officials sitting courtside, the team president, Michael Rowe,
watched Tuesday night's carnage from a seat near halfcourt. Rowe,
one of Calipari's biggest detractors, was jovial before the game,
but as the rout unfolded his expression became somber.
</P>
<P>
   And the usually collected Keith Van Horn screamed at Williams
and Lucious Harris about poor defense while the Nets walked off the
court for a timeout trailing by 14 points with three minutes left
in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're not shooting the ball well, you have to play good
defense,'' said Van Horn, who recorded 17 points and 11 rebounds.
``But we made a lot of little mistakes on defense tonight and it
got frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Horn followed Stephon Marbury, who led the Nets in scoring
for the second time since joining the team two games ago. The point
guard made some dynamic moves in recording 22 points and 8 assists.
But that was no consolation for Marbury, who once again was visibly
disappointed with his new team.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the native of Brooklyn insisted he had no regrets about
leaving the playoff-bound Minnesota Timberwolves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy where I'm at,'' Marbury said. ``I know things are
going to get better. I just know that I fell into an unfortunate
situation. It's very easy to get down, but I'm really happy. I
think we have a really good team. Right now, we just don't have any
concepts and by us not having concepts, we're just out there
playing basketball. We're not playing an NBA game.''
</P>
<P>
   Help might be on the way Wednesday, when the new assistants Jim
Lynam and Eddie Jordan will join the team. They will replace the
ill-prepared rental assistants, Hal Wissel and Mike O'Koren. There
will be no rest for the weary with games the next two nights,
Wednesday against Dallas at Continental Arena and Thursday in
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Lynam is believed to have a shot at becoming the Nets' next head
coach. He coached in Philadelphia from 1988 to 1992 and in
Washington from 1994 to 1997, serving under John Nash, now the
Nets' general manager, in both situations. Jordan coached
Sacramento for a year and a half before being replaced after last
season.
</P>
<P>
   The rookie Vince Carter led the Raptors with 20 points and 15
rebounds. Doug Christie, who scored 12 first-quarter points,
followed with 18, and Tracy McGrady had one of his best
performances of the season in recording 14 points and 13 rebounds.

START IS NICE FOR LAKERS' RICE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ Glen Rice came to Kurt Rambis with a simple
request: Put me in, coach. Now.
</P>
<P>
   After two games with the Lakers, Rice declared himself ready to
start. The rookie coach was in no position to argue with the NBA's
premier shooting ace, so Rambis consented Tuesday _ and let Rice
make him look like a sage.
</P>
<P>
   Rice started, found his shooting stroke early and promptly
unleashed it on the Minnesota Timberwolves, scoring 22 points,
eight in the fourth quarter, to carry the Lakers to a 107-101
victory.
</P>
<P>
   On the scale of difficult decisions Rambis has made as head
coach, this one ranked down there with choosing which glasses to
wear.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he'd feel more comfortable starting,'' Rambis said.
``I said, `OK.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Simple job.
</P>
<P>
   All Rice did in return was hit 4 of 10 3-pointers, even with
Kevin Garnett's gangly limbs stretching over him. His eight points
in the fourth came in a 2-minute, 14-second span, with 3-pointers
on either end of it, giving the Lakers a 98-95 lead that they never
relinquished.
</P>
<P>
   ``The confidence was rolling, the legs were feeling good, and I
had too much daylight,'' said Rice, who hit 8 of 17 shots overall.
``Even before the game, I was feeling that my legs were really
getting much stronger. I've always said that once I got my legs up
under me the shots were gonna go in. I just had to maintain my
concentration, stay focused and keep shooting the shots.''
</P>
<P>
   The more he did, the more they started to hit net instead of
iron. And for the Lakers, who gave up Eddie Jones' slashing and
defense to obtain Rice's 3-point cannon, it was a beautiful sight.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota, as per usual, was trying to double-team Shaquille
O'Neal in the low post. But now, for the first time, O'Neal knew he
could flip the ball back outside with confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him, I need a couple 3s from you right now,'' O'Neal
said.
</P>
<P>
   Rice was happy to comply.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Shaq) was saying, `Get open. Get open. Get open.' I was like,
OK, I'm getting open. A lot of credit to the big man,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal got 24 points himself, and Kobe Bryant scored 21 _ 11 in
the fourth quarter _ as the Lakers won their 11th in the past 12
games.
</P>
<P>
   But it didn't come as easily as Rice's shooting spree. The
Timberwolves dominated the second quarter and took a 54-47 halftime
lead by out-thugging the Lakers in the paint, scoring 15
second-chance points.
</P>
<P>
   At the half, Minnesota had collected 18 offensive boards and
outrebounded the Dennis Rodman-less Lakers 32-19. Four of five
Wolves starters scored in double figures, led by the front line of
Garnett, Joe Smith and Dean Garrett.
</P>
<P>
   Smith and Garnett finished with 22 and 21 points, respectively,
but Travis Knight, J.R Reid and Rice slowed them just enough in the
second half to pull out the win.
</P>
<P>
   ``Against an athletic, young team like Minnesota, big long guys
inside, you gotta get into their body, make it a physical game. We
did that in the second half,'' Reid said. If Garnett or Smith
rolled into the lane, ``just hit 'em. Bump 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest was up to the finesse guys. And those 3s must be
infectious. Along with Rice, Derek Harper and Bryant both hit
3-pointers in the late fourth-quarter run. Bryant's wide-open 3
effectively put the game away, 103-97, with 1:21 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers had entered the game in a 4-for-30 (13.3 percent)
slump from the arc. With Rice's elbow and legs near full strength,
that stat seems unlikely to repeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Glen's always been a deadly shooter. I'm just glad he's with
me,'' O'Neal said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it was coming,'' Reid said of his onetime Charlotte
teammate. ``It was only a matter of time.''

   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Yes, you heard right. Billyball is back.
</P>
<P>
   And so is almost everything that goes with it: the playground
dunks, the pressure-the-ball defense, the look-out-here-we-come
transition game, the you-betcha-we're-going-to-score-100-points
attitude, the so-loud-you-can't-hear-yourself-think crowds.
</P>
<P>
   Oh yeah, and the victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``Billyball's an attitude more than anything,'' Horned Frogs
guard Ryan Carroll explained.
</P>
<P>
   A return to Billyball has TCU (21-10) a step away from the
National Invitation Tournament semifinals and a trip to New York. A
Horned Frogs' victory against Oregon (18-11) in a game starting at
8:37 p.m. Wednesday at Daniel-Meyer Coliseum gets them on that
plane bound for Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Billyball's hard to play,'' said Horned Frogs coach Billy
Tubbs, his name defining his style. ``What we're doing right now is
so easy to coach.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Carroll: ``It's Billyball lite.''
</P>
<P>
   It's all of the running, slamming, scoring and intense fun of
Billyball without the full-court pressure, the what-shot-clock
approach to offense and the man-to-man-or-bust approach to defense.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, maybe, Billyball needed a new look.
</P>
<P>
   The main ingredient _ the swagger, as Lee Nailon likes to call
it _ had been missing for a while. It certainly wasn't there two
weeks ago when Brigham Young upset TCU in the first round of the
Western Athletic Conference tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Truth be told, it hadn't been around for almost a month leading
up to that game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what happened,'' Tubbs said, ``I think we got
disappointed, and we let that disappointment get to us. Some
disappointing things happened to us that we didn't handle
particularly well. Instead of stepping up, we went into a
semidepression.''
</P>
<P>
   Tubbs admits that after losing to BYU he feared returning for
practices to get ready for NIT games that many were predicting
instead of NCAA Tournament games that many had been expecting.
</P>
<P>
   At least a week of practice was ahead of them, and he wasn't
sure how his players would respond.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fun?'' Horned Frogs guard Prince Fowler said. ``There wasn't a
lot of that going around.''
</P>
<P>
   But a funny thing happened in those practices, a thing that
Fowler tries to explain but can't quite do in one word. ``It was
more like the way things were,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   They'd shoot around before practice like most folks do in their
back yard, with Derale Wilson providing comic relief with his
constant commentary. They'd scrimmage like they used to do on
playgrounds as kids, with Fowler providing the trash talk.
</P>
<P>
   They'd look at coach Tubbs, like they always do, to get their
lead on how to act.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's hard to believe,'' Fowler said, ``but he's having
fun. He's relaxed. When he's relaxed, we're relaxed.''
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere in there, the pressure evaporated and the fun
returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a tribute to our players how they've responded,''
Tubbs said. ``We're having fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Billyball is back, and maybe better than before.
</P>
<P>
   Cornhuskers coach Danny Nee conceded as much Monday after a
101-89 loss to TCU. It's the same style he remembers playing
against when Tubbs coached Oklahoma, only suited to Tubbs' current
personnel. It's the style that convinced TCU guard Vladimir Jaksic
to come to transfer to TCU.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure I hear of Billyball,'' Jaksic said. ``There was lots of
scoring and lots of running and lots of people in the stands
cheering, just like against Nebraska.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like Billyball is back.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about time,'' Fowler said. nn

ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR COMPANY'S 1998 EARNINGS SOAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY ENRIQUE RIVERO  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Take a strong earnings report, add a pending
stock split, and you get an energizing concoction that's sent
athletic shoe maker K-Swiss Inc.'s share price on a record sprint.
</P>
<P>
   The company reported Feb. 8 its 1998 profits nearly tripled to
$12.5 million, or $2.20 per diluted share, from 1997's $4.2
million, or 70 cents per diluted share. Sales for the year rose 39
percent to $161.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   K-Swiss also announced at that point that K-Swiss shareholders
could look forward to a two-for-one stock split and a 50 percent
increase in the quarterly cash dividend. The split, effective March
26, applies to stockholders of record as of March 15, according to
chief financial officer George Powlick.
</P>
<P>
   The result? The company's stock price has posted gains in almost
every session since Feb. 8 and nearly doubled in value from
$34.625. The upward trend ended Tuesday, when profit-taking pushed
the price down $3.125 to $61.875.
</P>
<P>
   The company has attributed the healthy results in part to an
accelerated marketing and advertising campaign. K-Swiss shoes are
carried by the major athletic footwear retailers, including
Footlocker, Powlick said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're having very good success with respect to our footwear
being in tune with the market -- it's resulted in very strong
earnings and accelerated results,'' he said. ``Our backlog is
growing very fast, also.''
</P>
<P>
   The backlog grew by 117 percent over the year, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Among K-Swiss's strongest selling styles during the year were
Sentir and Altezo. Another popular seller is the Classic, developed
in 1966 as the first all leather tennis shoe, said Kim Moore,
product manager for the company.
</P>
<P>
   The product has remained popular for a number of reasons, not
the least of which is that it's all white and has not changed over
the years. That means that retailers who carry the line don't have
to worry about it going out of style, forcing them to dump the
shoes into their sale bins.
</P>
<P>
   And retailers don't have to carry a minimum size run because
every sale automatically triggers an order for new stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Classic leather tennis shoe is the cornerstone of
K-Swiss,'' Moore said.

<P>
   BOURBONNAIS, Ill. _ They were just settling in for the night,
comfortably ensconced in the first-class double-decker sleeper car
of a train with a famous name, The City of New Orleans. They had
boarded in Chicago, just two hours before, and their train, its
legend celebrated in a popular American folk song, was due to pull
into New Orleans in the late afternoon of the next day.
</P>
<P>
   But in a single horrifying instant, everything changed. At 9:47
p.m. on Monday, Amtrak's City of New Orleans smashed into a
semi-trailer truck at a railroad crossing in this rural town about
55 miles south of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   By Tuesday afternoon, 13 passengers had been found dead, most of
them in the sleeper car. Some people were still unaccounted for,
and officials said on Tuesday night that the number was either
three or four. There were no signs that those people were alive.
</P>
<P>
   The first five cars of the train were mangled, twisted like
empty soda cans after the train hit the back of the truck and
derailed. Flames burst out, visible from miles away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure at this point I can collect my thoughts enough to
tell you what was going through my mind,'' said Michael
Harshbarger, chief of the tiny Bourbonnais fire department. ``I
don't think I've ever seen anything quite like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Transportation Safety Board, which is in charge of
investigating the crash, said on Tuesday night that in preliminary
interviews, the train engineer said he saw the truck go around the
closed gates at the crossing. Investigators also said the truck
driver told a different story, saying the gates started to close
after he was in the crossing. A safety board official, John Goglia,
said investigators were particularly interested in a set of tire
tracks. If the tracks match the truck's tires, he said, they would
indicate that the truck did try to go around the closed gate.
</P>
<P>
   Officials were releasing no details about the dead, whose bodies
were being kept in an old lumber company warehouse turned makeshift
morgue. But a woman in Nesbit, Miss., confirmed that four of those
killed _ a woman, her granddaughter and two other children _ were
returning home to Nesbit after a shopping trip to Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   There were 116 people injured, federal investigators said, with
49 of them still hospitalized on Tuesday night. All the survivors
were rescued Monday night, among them a group of 20 teen-agers from
Mississippi and their chaperones, returning from a ski trip to
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The train was carrying 196 passengers, 19 Amtrak employees and 2
employees of the Illinois Central Railroad, which manages the
railroad crossing.
</P>
<P>
   The truck driver, who was using a probationary permit after his
license had been suspended because of speeding tickts, was heading
east across the train tracks when the train hit. The collision
shattered the trailer section of the truck, which was packed with
heavy steel bars from a nearby steel factory. The driver was
treated and released, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The safety board said on Tuesday night that the train had been
traveling at 79 miles an hour, the maximum allowed on this stretch
of track. The train was blowing its whistle and had engaged its
emergency brake, Goglia said.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the day on Tuesday, rescue crews that had rushed
here from miles away continued to comb through the tangled metal,
hampered by piles of crushed debris and the need to make sure the
wreckage would not shift and endanger the rescuers themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The once-gleaming sleeper car had been slammed up onto one of
the train's two locomotives. It was broken down the middle and
ravaged by fire, Harshbarger said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The interior is filled with debris from the fire, and it's
necessary to search through that debris to find victims,''
Harshbarger said. ``It's simply a matter of digging with the gloved
hand, turning pieces of debris over in order to find someone.''
</P>
<P>
   Don Allen, 80, who was traveling with his wife from their home
in Winona, Minn., to visit their son in Florida, described the
frightening confusion of the accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was this violent jerking motion and all of a sudden we
just stopped and the lights went out,'' said Allen, who was riding
in one of the last of the train's 14 cars and had just settled down
to read a book. He heard a loud, grating noise and then, he said,
``All we could see was the smoke.''
</P>
<P>
   The crash was the third-deadliest accident in Amtrak's 26-year
history. The worst was a 1993 crash that killed 47 people when a
train plunged into a bayou near Mobile, Ala. In 1987, two trains
collided near Chase, Md., killing 16.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Thirty investigators from the safety board arrived on Tuesday
morning and were trying to determine what caused the accident.
</P>
<P>
   The truck driver, John R. Stokes, 58, of Manteno, Ill., a town a
few miles north of here, had had his commercial driver's license
suspended in January because he had received three speeding tickets
in 12 months, said David Druker, a spokesman for the Illinois
secretary of state's office.
</P>
<P>
   But because it was Stokes' first suspension he was allowed to
take a safety class and receive a temporary probationary permit.
Barring any problems, he would have got his regular license back on
March 25. His only previous infractions were two speeding tickets,
Druker said.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth R. Wykle, the administrator of the Federal Highway
Administration, said the agency would investigate the safety
compliance record of the company Stokes was driving for, Melco
Transfer Inc. of Peotone, Ill.

CARSON WONDERS ABOUT OVITZ ABSENCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Carson City Manager Jerry Groomes and Michael Padilla,
a member of the Carson Economic Development Committee, sat in a
corner of a large hotel ballroom here Tuesday and watched the NFL
pass before their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Owners like the honorable Dan Rooney and sincere Ralph C. Wilson
walked by, given wider berths by the media horde out of respect.
They watched the dowager owner of one team that vacated Southern
California, Georgia Frontiere, walk by attended by her
long-suffering aide, Marshall Klein.
</P>
<P>
   A moment or two later, the man who took the other team away from
Los Angeles, Al Davis, walked out and sparred with the media the
way a torero teases a bull. He took their questions and turned them
around. He dropped more cryptic comments than an episode of the
``X-Files.'' He asked reporters where they were from, as if
geography meant something to him.
</P>
<P>
   Groomes and Padilla, each wearing a blue hat with ``Carson 32''
on it, watched Ed Roski, the Kings owner and the man at the head of
the New Coliseum expansion proposal, and his colleagues work the
room.
</P>
<P>
   One, two, five, seven, 10... somewhere around 10, they stopped
counting all of the Roski-related personnel in the room. They were
severely outnumbered and they had every reason to wonder why.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Ovitz, the man who came to Carson and said he wanted
them as a partner in landing a NFL franchise, was supposed to be
the showman. He's the guy with the entertainment portfolio, the man
who knows how to put on a show. This looked like his turf, but he
wasn't around.
</P>
<P>
   The man who negotiated David Letterman's move from NBC to CBS
and just pocketed two agents from his old agency to work for his
new management company, was not here to work the room. He had
returned home, reportedly because the league told him he didn't
need to hang around.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, on the day the league conditionally agreed to put an
expansion team in L.A., the men in the Carson hats wondered what it
all meant, whether Roski's presence meant more than Ovitz's
absence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it means anything,'' said Padilla, a large man
with an appetite to make things happen. ``I just hope the league
knows what we have to offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the commissioner (Paul Tagliabue) came to visit, he liked
the interest people showed at the press conference. But we can do
more. We can do a lot more. Maybe we need to remind them what we
have to offer.''
</P>
<P>
   Carson, he said, has a lot to offer. Its vision is no less
intriguing as the Coliseum's. It doesn't have the tradition of the
old stadium, but it also doesn't have the baggage. In terms of
cutting-edge synergy, the idea of a mall and stadium complex puts
most cement doughnuts to shame.
</P>
<P>
   Carson also has fresh money. The city's pledged investment is
$180 million, $30 million of it in cash and $150 million via bonds,
bonds that have already unofficially received a good rating and
attracted interested buyers.
</P>
<P>
   But the undercurrent Tuesday afternoon clearly favored Roski and
the Coliseum. Three years ago, the NFL said it would sooner gargle
pesticide than return to the Coliseum. For Roski and Co. to still
be standing on the day the league said it might return was a hell
of an achievement.
</P>
<P>
   They have their own vision, and while unrealized, it's larger
than Carson's. Beyond a new Coliseum inside the shell of the old
Coliseum, an entire sports and entertainment corridor is being
built from the inside out, running from Dodger Stadium to the
Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   Eli Broad, Roski's partner, is a partner in redevelopment of
downtown, including the building of Disney Hall on the west side of
the Harbor Freeway and the Coburn Art School on Grand Avenue. As
part of the Staples Center deal, Roski has 20 acres of undeveloped
land that runs down Figueroa and around the Convention Center.
</P>
<P>
   The Roski/Broad utopia would see a 1,400-room hotel and major
retailers filling those 20 acres, as well as people-friendly links
from site to site.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people working on this know downtown will never be defined
by its commercial office space,'' said Michael Collins, executive
vice president of the L.A. Convention and Visitors Bureau, one of
many Roski-tied people at the meetings. ``But it's ground zero as
an entertainment and sports center.
</P>
<P>
   ``The climate in L.A. doesn't allow for the city funding a new
stadium. But in the next 3{ years, there will be $5 billion worth
of infrastructure in making it a sports and entertainment complex.
If they looked, they'd see exactly the kind of thing the league
says it would like in every city.''
</P>
<P>
   Carson can offer its own vision. It just isn't sure if it's
ground zero in the NFL's eyes. The league deadline for development
of L.A. might be six months, but the next 30 days will separate the
two L.A. groups.
</P>
<P>
   Carson wants to play. It just hopes its quarterback shows up. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   No one answered the door or the telephone at Stokes' house on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Goglia said Stokes had said in early interviews that he did not
see the train or the warning lights until he had started driving
across the tracks and that the gates closed before he could get out
of the path of the train. But Goglia said investigators needed to
conduct more interviews with Stokes before they could say whether
that was his complete version of events.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators will also re-interview the engineer, who said he
saw the truck try to get around the gates, Goglia said. The
engineer is among those hospitalized, and Goglia said his
medication made it difficult to interview him more thoroughly on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation confirmed that the truck had not been
overloaded, Goglia said, adding that the steel bars extended seven
feet beyond the trailer bed, a distance that is within the legal
limit but may have made the crash worse.
</P>
<P>
   Goglia also said investigators had taken blood and urine samples
from Mr. Stokes, administered a breath test for alcohol and checked
his schedule for the past 72 hours to see whether he was getting
enough rest. They did not say whether any of those test results
were in. Investigators will also compare the time that his truck
left the plant with the time of the crash to see how fast he was
going.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators will also examine whether cars parked near the
crossing might have obstructed the truck driver's view of the
train, Goglia said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the crossing's equipment, including gates, two signal
lights and a bell, was functioning properly Monday night. The
warning equipment started when it was supposed to, 27 second before
the train was due to come into the intersection.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Burke, a spokesman for Illinois Central, said it would not
have been possible for the truck to become trapped by the closing
gates, because the gates would have hit the truck and broken.
</P>
<P>
   Goglia said investigators checked the warning equipment's
history over the last 12 months and found only one malfunction, an
instance when the gates stayed down after the train had passed. He
said there had never been a time when the gates did not go down or
malfunctioned in any other way.
</P>
<P>
   There have been three previous fatal accidents at this railroad
crossing, in 1964, 1968, and 1988, according go the Illinois
Commerce Commission. State officials say that is a relatively good
safety record, given the number of trains that cross the
intersection, about 40 a day, traveling at speeds of 25 to 79 miles
per hour.
</P>
<P>
   Jolene M. Molitoris, administrator of the Federal Railroad
Administration, said the crossing was considered a good
intersection.
</P>
<P>
   A City of New Orleans train passes this way every night, pulling
out of Chicago about 8 p.m. It makes a few stops in Illinois, a
stop in Memphis and another Tennessee city, and virtually turns
into a local train in Mississippi, until it reaches New Orleans at
3:30 p.m. the following day. Another City of New Orleans train
makes the trip in reverse every day.
</P>
<P>
   The City of New Orleans was the main northbound train of the
great black migration from the South in the 1940s and 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   And it was celebrated in a folk song written by Steve Goodman
and made famous by Arlo Guthrie. The song croons about men dealing
cards in the club car, mothers rocking their sleeping babies and
the train ``passin' trains that have no names, freight yards full
of old black men, and the graveyards of rusted automobiles.''
</P>
<P>
   The chorus _ ``Good Morning America, how are you?'' _
memorialized the romance of the railroad age.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The modern-day City of New Orleans is a comfortable ride,
especially in the sleeping car, where passengers have a
``hospitality hour,'' a morning paper delivered to them and an
attendant on call 24-hours.
</P>
<P>
   But on Tuesday, all that was forgotten in the macabre accident
scene, where investigators were looking for answers.
</P>
<P>
   Safety board officials said they had interviewed the driver and
the train engineer and sent the train's black box to Chicago to be
analyzed. They plan to retest the crossing gates and lights and the
sensor on the tracks that trips the gates.
</P>
<P>
   They said the investigation was complicated by the presence of
two train cars on the side tracks, one full of steel and the other
full of furnace residue from the steel plant. The cars had been
struck in the derailment and were making the search for evidence
more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   The four people from Nesbit, Miss., who were killed had gone to
Chicago so the granddaughter, Jessica Bonnin, 12, and her two
friends could shop at a store that carried the American Girl dolls,
which feature historic details, and their accessories.
</P>
<P>
   The grandmother, June Bonnin, had opened a bed and breakfast
with her husband while she was still recovering from non-Hodgkin's
lymphoma.
</P>
<P>
   Among those injured was Ashley Bonnin, Mrs. Bonnin's daughter
and Jessica's aunt. She was hospitalized in stable condition.
</P>
<P>
   As the hours passed in Bourbonnais on Tuesday, rescue workers
faced a stiff winter wind as they clambered on top of the upended
and fractured train cars, searching for any glimpse of the missing.
</P>
<P>

   ``A lot of people were coming off the train searching for their
family members,'' said Karen Brzezicki, a firefighter and paramedic
for the Bourbonnais fire department and one of the first workers on
the scene. ``That was the hardest part, people searching for their
children. This is one of those things you don't want to see and you
hope you never have to see again.''

RAIDERS' DAVIS HOVERS OVER NFL MEETINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   By BOB KEISSER &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; Long Beach Press-Telegram &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   PHOENIX -- For anyone familiar with Los Angeles' tortured NFL
past, the presence of Al Davis and John Shaw sharing a hotel lobby
and talking about the NFL's latest flirtation with L.A. made one
reach for the antacids.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw, the Rams' President, engineered the move from Anaheim to
St. Louis for Georgia Frontiere. Raiders' owner Davis took the
Raiders back to Oakland at the same time. The NFL vacancy sign on
L.A.'s lawn was hammered in by these two men, and now they were
passing judgment on an expansion proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm optimistic that (L.A.) can get an expansion team,'' said
Shaw. In spite of the area's long, failed history of civil
civic-team relationships? ``I (ital) hope (end ital) they can get
an expansion team.''
</P>
<P>
   As Shaw spoke, Davis walked by and said ``John, tell them
there's no difference today than there was (four) years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis' comment fell cryptically on most ears, those who do not
recall the NFL once gave its blessing to Hollywood Park building a
stadium for the Raiders. The league gave Hollywood Park and R.D.
Hubbard a time deadline and conditions to meet, just as it did to
Carson and the Coliseum Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood Park didn't meet its deadline, the proposal died, and
Davis moved the Raiders back to Oakland. In Davis' view, the
league's resolution Tuesday looks familiar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Los Angeles has its own problems to solve,'' he said,
declining to elaborate but obviously considering the demerits of
the Coliseum and Carson proposals -- little public cash for the
Coliseum, and a perceived environmental problem in Carson.
</P>
<P>
   ``And so does the league.''
</P>
<P>
   That referred to Davis' suit in state court claiming that he won
territorial rights to L.A. in court and still owns them despite
having returned to Oakland. Davis believes the league sabotaged the
Hollywood Park proposal because it didn't want the Raiders in a new
stadium that would also serve as a future Super Bowl site.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want damages,'' he said about the suit. ``I want to be
somewhere we can prosper and win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Raiders have a lease in Oakland with 16 years remaining, but
Davis believes he can break it based on non-performance by the city
of Oakland and the group hired to handle Private Seat License (PSL)
sales.
</P>
<P>
   League attorney Frank Rothman says the suit is baseless and has
no impact on any expansion decisions. But the league's six-month
window for L.A. could be perceived as a stall until the suit
progresses further in the courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``You said that, not me,'' Davis said, enjoying the repartee
even as he tried to distance himself from it. ``What everyone
forgets is that L.A. would have a team and a state-of-the-art
stadium if Hollywood Park had been given the chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't want to get into that.''

FRANKLIN TELECOM TO JOIN AMEX
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DEBORAH ADAMSON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Franklin Telecom is moving up in the world by
switching from the lowly OTC Bulletin Board to the American Stock
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The telecommunications and Internet services company announced
Tuesday that it has met the higher capital standards and scrutiny
of the national exchange. Franklin, which has been trading on the
OTC as FTEL, will start trading at 8:30 a.m. Thursday under the
symbol FCM on the Amex.
</P>
<P>
   Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Frank Peters has been asked
to ring the opening bell at the exchange that day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It brings us to a whole new level,'' said Tom Russell, chief
financial officer of Franklin. ``We'll get broader exposure to the
financial markets because it's on a national exchange. (Our stock)
will get more stability.''
</P>
<P>
   Franklin could not have joined Nasdaq because it did not meet
its $4 stock price requirement, but Wall Street cheered the
announcement anyhow with Franklin's stock rising 34 cents, or 12
percent, to $3.25.
</P>
<P>
   The American Stock Exchange, which wants to attract cutting-edge
tech firms, was particularly attracted to Franklin's Internet
business, Russell said.
</P>
<P>
   The 19-year-old company makes equipment that allow phone calls
over the Internet. It is developing a voice-enabled Web site, which
allows an Internet user to click on it and be connected by phone to
the person or company behind the site. Russell said the site will
be helpful for technical support because a user can click on the
Web site and be connected by phone to technicians.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin's subsidiary, FNet, is developing long-distance phone
services transmitted over the Internet. ``An ISP (Internet service
provider) can add this equipment to their site and almost turn into
a phone company,'' Russell said.
</P>
<P>
   An ISP such as Earthlink or Prodigy hooks customers up to the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin's sales have shot up in its most recent quarter,
hitting $1.24 million in the second quarter ended Dec. 31 compared
with $284,000 in the year-earlier period, but it continues to
operate in the red. It lost $1.29 million in the second quarter,
compared with $868,000 in the year-earlier period.

VANDERBILT COURTS HUSKY COACH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By HOLLY CAIN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ For the second time in as many years, University of
Washington men's basketball coach Bob Bender is being courted by a
big-time program.
</P>
<P>
   Last year it was Texas, this week it's Vanderbilt University.
The Nashville, Tenn., school received permission from Washington
athletic director Barbara Hedges to talk with Bender, and Tennessee
newspapers already are referring to him as the leading candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want it to be where I'm labeled as someone who is
always looking,'' Bender said Tuesday, confirming his interest in
the Vanderbilt job. ``In the case of Vanderbilt, there's the
connection with Duke and it's a private school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Initially, this is their inquiry, but as you get more involved
you find out what will be factors and what won't. I'll have a
better idea when I talk to them (Vanderbilt).''
</P>
<P>
   Bender's assistant coaches said he had not addressed them about
his Vanderbilt candidacy. And Bender, who amassed an 85-83 record
in six years with the Huskies, said he had not yet made any plans
to visit the school this week but has spoken with Vanderbilt
athletic director Todd Turner by phone.
</P>
<P>
   Delaware coach Mike Brey withdrew his name from Turner's
consideration Monday, leading the media to put Bender atop Turner's
wish list. Mercer Island native Quin Snyder, a top Duke assistant
coach, is another prime candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Appalachian State coach Buzz Peterson, Southwest Missouri State
coach Steve Alford and New Mexico's Dave Bliss also are being named
as potential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Hedges is out of town and was unavailable for comment. Turner,
however, confirmed Tuesday afternoon that he has spoken to Hedges
and Bender, but he declined to give details on the search itself.
</P>
<P>
   He has been tight-lipped about his hunt since Jan van Breda
Kolff resigned as Vanderbilt coach Feb. 25 after a 104-81 record
and one NCAA tournament appearance in six seasons. Van Breda Kolff
struggled to retain Vanderbilt basketball's status as ``the game''
in town with competition from Nashville's newest tenants, the NHL
Predators and NFL Titans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't scheduled a visit, we've just had a preliminary
conversation,'' Turner said of Bender. ``Coach Bender has done such
a great job coaching and developed such a great reputation he will
be a candidate for many coaching jobs, and we're certainly
interested in him ...''
</P>
<P>
   Snyder acknowledged Tuesday that he, too, is interested in
talking to Vanderbilt and said his boss, Duke coach Mike
Krzyzewski, has encouraged him to pursue a head coaching job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel as if personally my career has evolved to a point where
I'm ready to pursue some head coaching vacancies,'' Snyder said.
``I've been given the go-ahead and that's part of coach's
(Krzyzewski) desire to grow and prepare those who have worked for
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Snyder also has held discussions with San Diego State about that
school's coaching vacancy, but he withdrew his name from
consideration two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   With top-ranked Duke in the midst of an NCAA tournament run,
Snyder said he doesn't want to be a distraction to the Blue Devils'
title hopes, calling a national title his ``first priority right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Bender will get a chance to explore those so-called
``factors'' of employment that could lure him back east, where he
played (1978-80) and served as an assistant coach (1984-89) for
Duke. Turner, too, has Atlantic Coast Conference ties as a former
North Carolina State athletic director.
</P>
<P>
   A bigger salary, a returning team and a new basketball complex
are among Vanderbilt's draws.
</P>
<P>
   Turner reportedly is prepared to offer a $500,000 salary
package, compared to the approximately $370,000 Bender made this
past season at Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Another consideration for Bender is a solid young program at
Vanderbilt, a member of the ultracompetitive Southeastern
Conference. Nine of the Commodores' 10 players return for the
1999-2000 season, while this year's 17-12 Husky team loses two top
players in center Todd MacCulloch and guard Donald Watts.
</P>
<P>
   And while UW's Hec Edmundson Pavilion will undergo a $39 million
renovation in time for the 2000-2001 season, Vanderbilt is starting
a $25 million refurbishing of its own arena, complete with a new
basketball practice facility.
</P>
<P>
   ``For what he has done for our program, and with his
personality, he is going to be a candidate for any job,''
Washington assistant coach Eric Hughes said. ``How serious he is
about this job, I don't know.''

TAKE MY REVISED DANCES. PLEASE.  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 21) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Md.)   (af)  
 Christopher Reardon's most recent article for Arts and Leisure was
about the composer-turned-choreographer Lucia Dlugoszewski.  
 By CHRISTOPHER REARDON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Talk about a tough crowd. Last fall, the
choreographer Danial Shapiro invited some friends and colleagues to
a preview of his new solo, ``Shtick,'' at the Southern Theater in
Minneapolis. Set to klezmer music and Henny Youngman jokes, the
dance was conceived as an upbeat sequel to his 1996 elegy about
Jewish ghettos and concentration camps, called ``What Dark/Falling
Into Light.''
</P>
<P>
   With the first public performance just two nights away, Shapiro
was looking for a pat on the back, and maybe a little constructive
criticism. Instead he learned what a lonely place the stage can
be. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized right away that I was in trouble,'' he recalled
during a recent interview. ``It was one of the most humiliating
showings I've ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, it was bad,'' added Joanie Smith, his wife and creative
partner, offering little consolation. ``I think, in the great
tradition of comedians, you bombed.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It was only an eight-minute piece,'' Shapiro went on. ``But as
I kept dancing I noticed that people were drifting toward the
exits. And these were our friends.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``No, worse,'' said Ms. Smith. ``Half of them were on our
payroll.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many choreographers would have cut their losses right there.
Yet, like the Borscht Belt comedians who inspired ``Shtick,''
Shapiro has doggedly reworked his material in the hope of getting
it right. A couple of key insights helped salvage the piece in time
for a public performance barely 48 hours after the preview.
</P>
<P>
   After months of further alterations, New Yorkers will see a
third version when Shapiro and Smith Dance opens a weeklong season
at the Joyce Theater on Tuesday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro's persistence reflects a tendency that's on the rise:
the urge to revise work that has already been shown publicly. Once
the badge of amateurs and perfectionists, this rethinking has
become for many artists an integral part of the creative process.
</P>
<P>
   Whether more choreographers are now going back to the drawing
board after opening night is hard to say, but among those who do,
many _ from Liz Lerman to Doug Varone to Mark Dendy _ cite cultural
and esthetic imperatives that were unheard of one or two
generations ago. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. Lerman and Ann Carlson, the act of revision has almost
become an art form in itself. Others, like John Kelly and Varone,
mess with success because they find the idea of a single,
definitive version of their work too constricting. And some, like
Shapiro and Ms. Smith, see failure as a catalyst, if not a
springboard to success. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything isn't so precious to us that we have to make art
with a capital A,'' said Dendy, whose dark pageant about a gay
dancer in psychotherapy, ``Dream Analysis,'' went through several
successful iterations last year. ``There's a very intense sense of
play, and we're not afraid to go back and make changes.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dendy and his peers know, of course, that they are not the first
to embrace playfulness and change. Or the first to tailor their
work to fit new casts and venues. Or even the first to cope with
austere budgets, tight deadlines and the pressure to create
something new each season. In dance, these are givens. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, every performance of every dance is a revision; the
nature of the art form makes it so. ``Dance only exists on the
body, when it's happening,'' said Eliot Feld, whose troupe, Ballet
Tech, returns to the Joyce Theater on April 6 for a five-week
season. ``There really is no dance until it's performed, so our
discourse with ourselves is necessarily a public one.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The direction of this discourse shifted, though, with the advent
of post-modern dance in the 1960s, as Trisha Brown and others began
to equate form and content. The upshot, three decades later, is a
partial demystification of dance making.
</P>
<P>
   The old Romantic notion of the artist as a solitary figure
touched by a divine spark has given way to a sense that creative
work relies as much on craft and conscious choices as it does on
sudden insights. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This emphasis on process could make a relic of the dance canon.
If a choreographer's work is never done, critics, peers and the
public may have a hard time agreeing on its significance. By
contrast, there was a positive consensus about Martha Graham's
``Appalachian Spring,'' George Balanchine's ``Agon'' and Alvin
Ailey's ``Revelations'' when they were first performed. But many
choreographers have grown wary of such categorical truths. It's the
journey that thrills them, not the destination. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to fix and change until there isn't anything more to
learn from it,'' said Ms. Lerman, who showed her latest
work-in-progress, ``Hallelujah,'' this past Friday at the Lisner
Auditorium in Washington. ``Once I reach that point, of course, the
work tends to fall out of the repertory rather quickly.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even harder to pin down is Varone's ``Aperture.'' Just as light
can behave as a wave one moment and a particle the next, this 1994
trio has come to lead a dual existence. Varone initially set it to
a piano etude by Shubert, and sometimes he still stages it that
way. But in an effort to show how music can shape our perception of
movement, he often substitutes a different score: Janis Joplin's
gravelly rendition of Gershwin's ``Summertime.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell the dancers not to change the movement or the intent,''
said Varone, who presented the Joplin version last month at the
World Financial Center's Winter Garden. ``What the dancers perform
is the purity of the Shubert, but what the audience sees is the
grit of the Joplin.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Premieres are seldom the best indication of what is happening in
a dance, said David White, executive director of Dance Theater
Workshop in Manhattan. ``Some works are way stations,'' he
explained. ``The artist may be taking chances on a new set of rules
and approaches that she doesn't have a firm handle on yet. Those
works can be problematic, and they may not be worth revisiting. But
what I'm interested in is what comes next. Did it take her
somewhere new?'' &QL;

BACK IN RIGHT, BUHNER FIELDS SOME TOUGH REALIZATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEORIA, Ariz. _ Maybe Jay Buhner thought this would be the fun
part.
</P>
<P>
   After beating the clock in his comeback from elbow surgery in
September, after a grueling winter of successful rehab and
countless lectures from Mariner doctors, coaches and friends about
how Buhner must take it slowly, maybe he thought his improbably
quick return to right field would make everything feel all right
again.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Buhner started in right field for the Mariners in their
6-3 Cactus League win over the Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, an important bit of order was restored to the M's, who
besides a number of other woes last season desperately missed their
ringleader right fielder in 90 of 162 games. Then came the ``Tommy
John'' surgery that was supposed to sideline Buhner for the early
months of the 1999 season, too.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, though, was as much a reality check for Buhner as an
affirmation of his rightful place in the universe. Right field, the
place he calls his home, felt a little cold, a little strange. If
he was looking for instant confirmation that his place in the
constellation of big-time baseball players was safely fixed, Buhner
came out a little leery.
</P>
<P>
   After he trotted out to right, after he tamped down the plush
green grass with his cleats, after he heard cheers from Buhner
Boneyard fans sitting on the berm behind the right-field wall at
the Mariners' spring training park, Buhner heard a voice in his
head.
</P>
<P>
   The voice was talking about some wacky and unfamiliar stuff,
like: Take it slow. Don't do anything stupid. Be smart.
</P>
<P>
   Buhner's private mantra made him realize that for all the hard
work he had put in just to make it back this far, this fast, the
toughest part is just beginning.
</P>
<P>
   A player who notched his stardom by playing with reckless
abandon must play with caution, at least for now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not out of the woods yet. My goal is to be out there in
right field on opening day. Until I'm out there, realistically, I'm
not where I need to be. Just got to be smart. Don't do anything
stupid. Keep working. Build my arm strength up. But I can't say
it's over yet.''
</P>
<P>
   No one expected Buhner back this fast, although he has his
reasons _ not the least of which is that he is in the last year of
his contract.
</P>
<P>
   The team owns an option for 2000, and Buhner, who said he felt
terrible not being able to earn his money last season, wants to
prove he will be a bargain for the M's, who can re-sign him for
$6.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Fact is, if Buhner had a longer deal, or if the M's were certain
to pick up his 2000 option, he might not be trying quite so hard to
play most if not all of the 1999 season in right field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't jeopardize my team'' by doing something he wasn't
ready to do, Buhner said. But he does have a desire to reclaim his
career, to make sure he goes out on his own terms.
</P>
<P>
   But now his right arm, the one with the new tendon in the elbow,
must be dealt with carefully _ tough for a man whose right arm, as
much as his bat, defines him as one of the game's best outfielders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my pride and joy. I mean, I'm known for my arm. You
read a lot of the baseball cards. On the back, it says: Known for
his strong, cannon-like arm. I've made a name, no doubt about it,
for throwing,'' Buhner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to toot my own horn, but I don't get the opportunity
to throw out as many guys anymore because a lot of guys don't want
to test me. But that might change this year. I've got to be
prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Buhner seemed sobered by the test he got during his
five innings in right field. In the top of the third, Cubs third
baseman Gary Gaetti sliced the ball down the right-field line,
giving Buhner a chance to see how he would react. Buhner could not
resist doing a little more than he should have, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the one ball down the line. I got a good jump on it,
good angle and I saw (second baseman Carlos Guillen) but he seemed
like he was about 10 feet away from me,'' Buhner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something told me to throw it to him, and then when I let go
of it, I threw it to (first baseman) Butch (Huskey), who was
halfway to home plate, just to kind of give it a test. That's when
I came into the dugout and said, `Easier said than done.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners will try to slow Buhner down some. He will DH
Wednesday, have a day off Thursday, head back to right field on
Friday, have another day off Saturday, then switch between right
and left fields for the rest of spring training.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, on the same day Buhner took back right field for the
Mariners, there was news out of Chicago that 1998 National League
Rookie of the Year Kerry Wood would likely miss this entire season
due to a tear in his elbow.
</P>
<P>
   Buhner, a fellow Texan, was particularly sympathetic to what
lies ahead for Wood. When Buhner got to first base Tuesday on a
fielding error, he exchanged words with Cubs first baseman Mark
Grace about Chicago's brilliant young power pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Gracie, just do me a favor, just make sure that every
day you talk to the kid (Wood) and make him feel like he's part of
the team, because for me that was the hardest thing. When you're
away from the team, you're not able to go out and perform. That's a
lost feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Buhner took a huge step toward making sure he isn't
lost anymore. It was worth the hard work and the rush, even if this
hellion of a ballplayer knows he must take it slowly _ for now,
anyway.

 NEW YORK: somewhere new?''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For Ms. Lerman, one key to making good dances is getting useful
feedback, a commodity she has found to be in short supply. So
several years ago she devised a structured way for talking about
creative work, which she calls the ``critical response process.''
Speaking by phone from her studio in Takoma Park, Md., she said it
typically entails having a choreographer sit down with a dozen or
more people (usually peers, sometimes audience members, but seldom
reviewers) who saw her work the night before.
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of an hour, a moderator leads them through a
series of seven increasingly frank exchanges, moving from positive
reactions to neutral questions to charged opinions. In the final
stages, which are optional, the discussion turns to thematic issues
(``Hallelujah,'' the subject of such a forum yesterday, deals with
darkness, faith and pets) and ways to make revisions. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The aim is not feel-good therapy or choreography by consensus
but a higher level of critical discourse, Ms. Lerman said. And the
process is not limited to dance. Visual-art curators at the Walker
Art Center in Minneapolis and actors at the New York Theater
Workshop have given ``critical response'' a try. ``With good
feedback, you want to get right back to work in the studio,'' she
said, explaining its appeal. ``With bad feedback, you just lie in
bed for three days.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro didn't have three days. But he had two, and he wasn't
inclined to waste them. The morning after his preview last October,
he sat alone in his studio and jotted down some of the thoughts
that ran through his mind the night before: ``I'm sorry. I can do
this. If you'll just give me a second chance.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ordinarily, Shapiro, 41, and Ms. Smith, 46, make dances together
and share the choreographer's credit. Since starting their
eight-member troupe in 1987, they have come to be known for their
zany brand of social commentary. Relying on iconic props and
physical abandon, they have often explored domestic dysfunction,
beginning with ``George and Betty's House'' and ``Family.'' Lately
their attention has turned to language and religion. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Our work evolves in stages,'' said Shapiro. ``We take on very
complex ideas and wrestle with them over time; it can take two or
three years. We've always done it that way, but we didn't realize
until recently that it was our process. We just thought we didn't
get the work done on time.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He knew his self-deprecating humor wouldn't save him last fall.
``Shtick'' already had enough punch lines, he said. What it lacked
was a countervailing sense of vulnerability. Then it occurred to
him that his list of apologies might serve as a monologue that made
the risk of failure palpable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The preview was a horrible experience,'' he said. ``But then I
realized it was inextricable from the character of the piece,
which, after all, was about a comedian in the Catskills trying to
win over the audience.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That epiphany underscores the couple's chief difference from
Alwin Nikolais and Murray Louis, who employed them as soloists from
1978 to 1985. Essentially, they take Nikolais' maxim _ ``Dance is
about motion, not emotion'' _ and turn it on its head. ``We start
with emotion,'' said Ms. Smith. '`The dance follows.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many choreographers would not have made the effort to fix
``Shtick.'' ``If a ballet doesn't work, it just doesn't work, and
you move on,'' said Feld. Shapiro's instincts also contradicted the
legendary dance instructor Bessie Schonberg, who died in 1997 at
the age of 90. ``Bessie always said, `Don't go back; do another,'''
he said. ``It's good advice, but sometimes you can't do another.
You've fallen into something that's really feeding you.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Shtick,'' which he and Ms. Smith see as a character study for
a larger dance still to come, isn't finished yet. Nor is it the
only dance on the program to undergo such a public transformation.
``Notes From a Seance,'' a Victorian-style tale about a religious
charlatan and a sham scientist, has also appeared in many
incarnations. (Like ``Shtick,'' it has music composed by Scott
Killian.)  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Notes'' first appeared at the Joyce in 1997, as a short
romantic duet called ``Piano.'' Last year at Dance Theater
Workshop, it returned as ``Piano _ a Melodrama,'' a 75-minute romp
about the Russian mystic Helena Blavatsky, who invented theosophy.
</P>
<P>
   For the latest version, Shapiro and Ms. Smith have trimmed 20
minutes by cutting and overlapping several passages, shuffled
casting for some of the solos and added new visual elements. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The original duet doesn't survive, but it got us here,'' said
Ms. Smith. ``Without it, I never would have had the courage to
choreograph to Beethoven's `Moonlight Sonata.''' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Such breakthroughs are the couple's primary reason for revising.
``In dance you can endlessly tinker, but I don't find it that
productive,'' she said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not just tweaking,'' added Shapiro, in what could serve
as a manifesto for many choreographers today. ``We're looking for
ways to get serious ideas across as they become increasingly clear
to us.''

CHAMBER MUSIC, TRADITIONAL ARTS, VIRTUAL SANTA FE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 21) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 Lawrence B. Johnson is the music critic of The Detroit News.  
 By LAWRENCE B. JOHNSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   What began as a New York appearance by performers of the Santa
Fe Chamber Music Festival has evolved into a virtual weekend in the
historic capital of New Mexico: a three-day musical and cultural
holiday, beginning on Thursday, mostly within the confines of the
Metropolitan Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
   And as befits Santa Fe, where controversy flows back through
history to the city's founding in 1610, the music is likely to be
accompanied by a note of political discord.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Wilson, the author of the provocative book ``The Myth of
Santa Fe,'' will lecture on the emergence of the cultural profile
that provides the city with its chief industry: tourism. David
Warren, a Pueblo Indian and retired deputy director of the National
Museum of the American Indian at the Smithsonian Institution, will
discuss the Met's current exhibition of Indian art, ``Native
Paths.''
</P>
<P>
   Another hot topic: chili. Betty Fussell, a food historian, will
retrace the converging influences of the Spanish and American
Indian diets that shaped Santa Fe cuisine. Robert Morean, the owner
of the Santacafe, and his chef, David Sellars, will bring a taste
of the real thing, preparing an appetizer and main course for
diners at the Mark Hotel, near the Met, on Friday and Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of serving up Santa Fe whole came to Marc Neikrug, the
artistic director of the chamber music festival, as he pondered the
fact that neither his group nor its musical fare bore the unique
stamp of their Southwestern locale.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do I make it Santa Fe instead of seven musicians from New
York coming back to play at the Met Museum?'' he said he had asked
himself, referring to the likes of the pianist Max Levinson, the
violist Cynthia Phelps and the cellist Peter Wiley. ``Well, maybe
we aren't all from New York, but you see the problem. Actually,
it's the same problem everywhere. Travel around Europe, and see
who's performing, and you'll find that 80 percent of the people who
play concerts in the world live within five blocks of each other on
the Upper West Side.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the conventional chamber music repertory offered no
particular connection to Santa Fe, Neikrug said, he chose works for
the Met concerts on Friday and Saturday that at least engaged
ethnic issues: Brahms' G minor Piano Quartet, with its touches of
Gypsy music; Hebrew songs by Ravel; the Third String Quartet of
Viktor Ullmann, an Austrian Jew who perished in the Nazi
concentration camp at Terezin, and a collection of Arabic songs
composed by the young Egyptian baritone Kamel Boutros, who will
sing them.
</P>
<P>
   In Wilson's view, the absence of Southwestern and American music
from Neikrug's programming is not an issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of the whole range of activities in a given cultural
setting,'' he said, ``only a small proportion become public symbols
of ethnic identity: usually cuisine, often architecture, sometimes
music. New Orleans, for example, brings to mind the French Quarter,
certainly the cuisine, jazz and zydeco music.
</P>
<P>
   ``But music in Santa Fe, a distant outpost in the period of the
Spanish Baroque, largely consisted of a guitar and a fiddle playing
dance music. Its history is one of struggle and defending against
raids by Comanches and Apaches. It was a culture of poverty. The
music was folkloric.''
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, Wilson said, European-style classical music has
become an expression of modern Santa Fe. The summerlong chamber
music festival has presented 26 seasons; the highly successful
Santa Fe Opera has filled summer nights since its founding in 1955.
</P>
<P>
   ``For all its adobe appearance, Santa Fe is a very modern city
whose citizens watch television and use the Internet,'' Wilson
added. ``A component of its population are followers of classical
music.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Neikrug said, he wanted to bring a vivid sense of Santa
Fe to the Met. ``I was left with the same question: How can I
recreate as much of the Santa Fe experience as humanly possible
without the audience being there physically.''
</P>
<P>
   For the answer, Neikrug, who was born in New York but lives in
Santa Fe, turned to two fellow townsfolk, Wilson, an Iowa native
educated at Yale University and the University of New Mexico, and
Warren, who was born in the Santa Clara Pueblo, near Santa Fe, and
earned a doctorate in Latin American colonial history at the
University of New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Warren said that his first impulse was to focus on Pueblo arts
but that the richness of the Met's ``Native Paths'' exhibition
prompted him to present a wider perspective on American Indian
crafts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to cause people to look at Native American art in
slightly different ways than they might,'' he said. ``For one
thing, it's important to remember that the objects that the public
in general regards as art were actually created for specific
purposes, whether practical or ceremonial. The concept of esthetics
isn't really a part of Native American culture.''
</P>
<P>
   And on that point rests a contemporary hot button. From the
viewpoint of American Indians, Warren said, the wealth of material
accumulated in collections like ``Native Paths'' represents an
ancient patrimony. And increasing public consciousness of that
view, reflected in the return of many items to Indians' hands, has
stimulated what Warren called a cultural renaissance in American
Indian society.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just as true of the Pueblos as it is of other tribes
throughout America,'' he said. ``While it's quite important in
principle that cultural and intellectual material be restored, it
also has a direct bearing on contemporary cultural and artistic
development. This is unprecedented, and the effects are yet to be
fully appreciated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks to the return of classical pieces, a revitalization of
traditional arts is occurring that may not be immediately evident
to the public. But there is a new force at hand, which is the
Native American sense of responsibility to its own traditions. It's
almost a paradox. The more rapid and complex and technological the
world we enter, the deeper grows the sense of tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Warren added, American Indians in general _ more than 500
tribes across the country _ are not all clamoring to recover the
objects of their patrimony now held in museums or private
collections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many tribes have said, for whatever reason, that they do not
need to have them returned,'' he explained. ``They are only
concerned that the objects are properly cared for and to help the
public gain a better understanding of the things they see. It's
really a new relationship between the tribes and the museums, a
mutual sense of responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, in his book, grapples with a different sort of borrowing
from American Indian heritage: the romantic image.
</P>
<P>
   ``Santa Fe is an El Dorado, an exotic outpost glowing in the
sunset, a tourist magnet that has enjoyed a boom since the 1980s,''
he said. ``And look what the mystique of Santa Fe is based on:
Pueblo and Spanish culture. Yet those are the people of Santa Fe in
need. It's not legitimate to use those icons as advertising images
to attract people, then not pay attention to the people being
displaced by gentrification and a real-estate boom.''
</P>
<P>
   Tracking the community's course from its founding by Pedro de
Peralta as a Spanish territorial capital, Wilson's critical history
underscores Santa Fe's character as a melting pot and analyzes the
forces that have contributed to what he portrays as a conflicted
and ultimately mythic self-image.
</P>
<P>
   New Mexico was rejected in its bid for statehood several times
before it was admitted to the Union in 1912, along with Arizona. At
one point, Congress contemplated lumping the two territories
together as a single new state, Montezuma.
</P>
<P>
   Predominantly white America took a dim view of the predominantly
Mexican and Indian mix of New Mexico, Wilson writes. Thus occurred
a historic split in personality, as the state, holding out Santa Fe
as its crown jewel, offered the look and feel of Anystate, U.S.A.,
to Congress while selling its Western exoticism to tourists.
</P>
<P>
   In 1920, Santa Fe consolidated its bid for tourism by adopting
what Wilson calls a myth that prefigured the Disneyland ideal: from
that time forward, the entire community (or at least 90 percent of
it) would present the same adobe facade to the world.
</P>
<P>
   Or rather, stucco mixed with adobe pigment. But it would be one
face, one lure, one myth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do see that as symbolic of the larger problem, but I also
have to say I feel a certain degree of optimism about the city,''
Wilson said. ``I live there. I see its remarkable cultural
vitality: the museums, restaurants, bookstores, opera, chamber
music, the walking zones, the artist colony. And I think we're
starting to see some understanding among our political leaders that
they need to take an active role in counteracting displacement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Above all, I'm not trashing tourists and amenity migrants,''
he said, defining the latter as ``people who move to nice places
like Aspen, Colo., Santa Barbara, Calif., and Santa Fe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us take our turn at being a tourist,'' he said. ``I'd
just like to see people be more aware of the economic impact we can
have, and not accept the stereotype.''
</P>
<P>
   Neikrug, the chamber music festival director, who has trimmed
his role to that of cultural partner for this Santa Fe immersion,
said: ``I'd like to take something like this everywhere we tour.
Everyone is looking for a broader experience. That's my goal with
programming for the Santa Fe Chamber Music Festival, to offer
dimensions beyond great music played well.''

FAMILY AFFAIR: DAVID BELL DRAWS ON PRIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEORIA, Ariz. _ There's a new nickname in the Mariners clubhouse
this spring. Pitching coach Stan Williams coined it for infielder
David Bell. It's ``Gus,'' and Bell loves it.
</P>
<P>
   Gus Bell was David's grandfather and his hero. Buddy Bell is
David's father and best friend. The Bells are one of only two
families _ the Boones are the other _ with three generations of big
leaguers.
</P>
<P>
   Williams pitched against Gus in the '50s and '60s, a fact not
lost on David, who has asked Williams for his memories.
</P>
<P>
   This year, for the first time in his major league career, Bell
is wearing No. 25, just like Gus and Buddy.
</P>
<P>
   Woody Woodward, the man who traded for David Bell last August,
roomed with Gus on the Milwaukee Braves in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   ``He couldn't have been a better guy,'' said Woodward, M's vice
president of baseball operations. ``He was all business, a real
professional. I can see things in David that remind me of Gus,
because he's very business-like on the field. He knows how to play
the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Aug. 31, the day rosters froze for postseason play, the
Cleveland Indians traded Bell for second baseman Joey Cora, who had
struggled in '98, had no future with the Mariners and, Woodward
thought, had no trade value.
</P>
<P>
   Cora has retired. Bell has a two-year contract with Seattle. It
might turn out to be one of Woodward's simplest and best moves.
Bell can play anywhere in the infield and has impressed the M's
this spring with his glove and bat. He is perhaps the best example
of the club's recent emphasis on adding depth and versatility.
</P>
<P>
   The trade marked the second time Cleveland dealt Bell for
late-season help. He was shipped to St. Louis in July 1995 and
returned to Cleveland on waivers last April. He started at second
base for much of the year, ranking third in the league defensively
and batting .261 with 10 homers.
</P>
<P>
   Bell is grateful to the Indians simply for drafting him. A
160-pound high school third baseman in Cincinnati, he was a good
fielder but only a contact hitter, and he was surprised when the
Indians took him in the seventh round.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never knew I'd hit a professional home run when I first
signed,'' Bell said.
</P>
<P>
   He hit his first homer in his second pro season and cherishes
the memory. Gus and Buddy drove from Ohio to Myrtle Beach, S.C.,
where Bell's Columbus, Ga., team was playing. He wanted to make
them proud, and did. The kid was on his way.
</P>
<P>
   ``They knew the odds against a major league career,'' Bell said.
``They didn't make any predictions, because if I didn't make it,
they didn't want me any more disappointed than I already would be.
I think they thought I would, but they didn't tell me that. It was
more just encouragement. They never said anything negative.''
</P>
<P>
   Buddy Bell tried not to push his sons into baseball. In fact,
says Bell, a former All-Star who played for four teams from
1972-89, sometimes he wishes his boys hadn't taken up the family
business, which he knows can be so tough.
</P>
<P>
   But all three have; besides David, son Mike is in the New York
Mets system, and Rick is with the Los Angeles Dodgers. None was
more passionate about the game than David, who was born the year
Buddy made the majors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would buy him toys, but he wouldn't play with anything but
a ball and bat,'' said David's mother, Gloria. ``Big Wheels,
trucks, blocks _ forget it. They would just sit there and go to
waste until Michael came along.''
</P>
<P>
   When David was 6, Buddy started taking him on road trips. By the
time he was a teenager, David had seen every park in the AL, and
his memories of each remain vivid.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first trip was to Seattle and Minnesota,'' he said. ``The
Kingdome was the first dome I'd ever been in, and I thought it was
the greatest place in the world. I'd probably get a few arguments
now, but I thought it was a huge amusement park. What more could
you want?''
</P>
<P>
   For David, it was more than fun and games. He studied his Gold
Glove dad in the field, taking special note of how quickly he
released the ball. That lesson carries over today: Bell uses a
glove with almost no pocket so he can throw the ball the instant he
receives it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the best I ever saw,'' David said of Buddy. ``I try to
be as good as him, but I don't think I'll ever be that good.''
</P>
<P>
   An adoring son, David never went to bed without knowing how
Buddy had done that night. A loving father, Buddy was the
disciplinarian but never let an argument fester overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Now, David and Buddy talk several times a week, and only
sometimes about baseball. It is a friendship, David said, built on
endless parental support and the realization he's so much like his
dad, both on and off the field.
</P>
<P>
   Funny how that works. Buddy takes after his father, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``David was having a problem with one of his coaches in
school,'' said Buddy, now minor league field coordinator for the
Cincinnati Reds. ``I'd just had enough of it. My dad told me, if
you don't go up there and support your son, who's going to? That
always made a lot of sense to me. He's never going to know what it
means to be loyal and supportive unless you show him the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Buddy's playing career lasted through David's junior year in
high school, and it was Gus who took his place at David's games.
David had a similarly close relationship with Gus as he did with
Buddy.
</P>
<P>
   ``But my grandpa could be more the hero, because everything he
did was positive,'' David said. ``He could hang out with us. We did
a lot together. He pretty much lived for us playing the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Gus, who played 15 major league seasons, had one rule: no
negativity allowed. David smiles when he thinks of how his
grandfather could find the good in anything he'd done. In a game
where every hitter fails most of the time, such encouragement was
invaluable.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never said one negative thing to me my whole life,'' David
said. ``And in baseball, that's so important. It was always
encouragement, everything was positive. He played a huge part in me
getting to the big leagues.''
</P>
<P>
   Gus Bell lived just long enough to see his grandson's dream come
true. David was the last player added to Cleveland's opening day
roster in 1995, making the team because of an injury to Sandy
Alomar. Buddy was an Indians coach.
</P>
<P>
   The team was in Detroit when Gus, 66, suffered a heart attack.
David left the team for two days and saw his grandfather, who was
not well but was able to talk, and knew David had played in the
majors. Later that week, David Russell ``Gus'' Bell died.
</P>
<P>
   David batted only twice for the Indians that year, and he didn't
even get a hit. But no two at-bats could have meant more.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to bring him back or anything, but it was a big
deal to me, because he was there for me all along,'' Bell said.
``It seemed like it was just as important to him as it was to me. I
just felt like I'd made him happy, made him proud.''

FOR A CHAMELEON OF MODERNISM, YEARS OF GROPING  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 21) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ For a moment, picture the Mexican muralist Diego
Rivera as he was in 1907: obscure, a shy, virginal art student
boarding a Spanish steamer, the Alfonso XIII, and heading for the
port of La Coruna in Spain.
</P>
<P>
   He had a small pension to study abroad from the governor of
Veracruz, who among other things, we have learned since then, was
involved in the slave trade, though about that matter Rivera was
either oblivious or unconcerned, probably both. He was just focused
on a career.
</P>
<P>
   Picasso and Braque had invented Cubism in France, but at that
point Rivera's knowledge of modern art, gleaned from art school in
Mexico, was second-hand Spanish Symbolism. Later Rivera remembered
himself, ``as if I were watching from somewhere in space, outside
myself, a 20-year-old dolt, so vain, his face covered with youthful
pimples, wishing to be the owner of the universe, like all other
snotty youths of his generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Standing at midnight on the very bow of the Alfonso XIII,
watching the ship break the seas to leave behind a wake of lace,
and declaiming some fragments from Zarathustra at the top of his
voice _ that is the most deplorable and sublimely pathetic thing I
have ever known. That was me.''
</P>
<P>
   Or it was as he wished us to think he had been, because, after
all, we can never entirely trust Rivera's own subsequent accounts,
which were wild, self-aggrandizing fantasies, even when they were
ostensibly self-mocking. The more charmingly ridiculous he could
make himself seem as a young man, the more remarkable we might
believe his transformation to be. Even so, the basic description is
plausible: the gifted yokel on a voyage of self-discovery.
</P>
<P>
   The big Diego Rivera retrospective, organized by the Cleveland
Museum of Art with the Consejo Nacional para la Cultura y las Artes
and the Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes in Mexico City, leans
particularly on these early years, before Rivera returned from
Europe to Mexico and started painting the murals for which he
rightly became most famous. The point: that the murals have
obscured the value of his previous work.
</P>
<P>
   And certainly they have, though never entirely. His pictures
from Europe have always been more or less familiar. They are true
tours-de-force of youthful arrogance and facile ambition,
chameleonlike: Rivera, once settled in Europe, seems to have made
variations on almost all the new art he came across _Gauguin,
Pissarro and, of course, Picasso.
</P>
<P>
   The first half of the exhibition looks virtually like a group
show, Rivera testing out one style after another, with an alarming,
lapidary ease.
</P>
<P>
   There's his watercolor of a tree a la Mondrian, for example, and
his ``Catalan Landscape,'' after Seurat. His fine ``View of
Toledo,'' a variation on El Greco in the blocky mode of Braque's
Estaque pictures, casts the city in an engulfing pink light, its
cathedral rising on a granite promontory above the deep gorge of
the Tagus river.
</P>
<P>
   His portrait of Adolfo Best Maugard nods toward Spanish
salonists like Zuloaga (the figure's a fop in top coat and leather
gloves, his body stretched and twisted like taffy), but the style
is closest now to Robert Delaunay.
</P>
<P>
   And so on. After finally making his reputation among the Cubists
in Paris, Rivera abandoned that style as well to become, like
Picasso, a Neo-Classicist in the manner of Ingres, having realized,
no doubt, that the winds of fashion had shifted after World War I.
It's not meant to diminish Rivera's talent to say that he was
sensitive to fashion and the marketplace. An artist can be
calculating and affecting at the same time, a condition that
describes Rivera throughout most of his career.
</P>
<P>
   The formal connections between his early pictures and his murals
have always been fairly clear. Beginning in the 1920s, back in
Mexico, Rivera adapted European modernism to a new kind of public
art. The faceting and collapsing of three-dimensional form and its
dispersal across the picture plane, the free adaptation of scale
and the general mechanistic symbolism: all these aspects of Cubism
served Rivera's purposes.
</P>
<P>
   He became more successful than Picasso at transforming Cubism
from easel scale to mural scale because he mixed Cubism with other
art _ with what he had learned from the frescos of Giotto, for
example, and above all with the giant decorative schemes at ancient
Mexican ruins. These works gave him not only native source material
but also an essential abstract architecture for the organization of
vast, multiscene compositions.
</P>
<P>
   His new art fused ancient and modern ideas to match Mexico's
post-colonial self-image, and in a way that also conveyed a
particular hieratic solemnity and spiritual weight. The murals were
political pronunciamientos, expressed with the force of conviction,
which came across as a form of faith.
</P>
<P>
   By stressing the early work, the exhibition can't be said really
to reinvent Rivera for us, though it does clarify what was good
about him when he was young: his energy, elegance and coloristic
subtlety, above all. Shows justify themselves by emphasizing some
new discovery or twist on history, and maybe in Rivera's case there
is a particular virtue in highlighting his temporary role as a
Cubist in Paris because it gives his legacy, and by association,
Mexican art, a different slant or prestige.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But it is for the murals that he will always be best known
because they made him a national artist and turned him into perhaps
the only painter of the century, Picasso aside, whose fame allowed
him to be a kind of global diplomat.
</P>
<P>
   He actually wanted to be an artist for the whole of the
Americas, if that were possible. He saw the potential of creating
an American art celebrating American engineering, which he felt was
the truest indigenous attribute. ``American engineering,'' he once
said, ``is the real artistic expression of the genius of this part
of the world,'' and by this part of the world he meant the
continent, including the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But at this task he was not successful. He precipitated the
infamous debacle at Rockefeller Center, where his mural was
destroyed after he refused to remove a portrait of Lenin in it.
Another mural, commissioned by Edsel Ford (a tribute to, among
other things, American engineering), was a public-relations fiasco.
</P>
<P>
   Laid-off automobile workers in Depression-era Detroit did not
embrace the idea that a painter, especially a foreign painter,
never mind that he was a Communist, had been paid $10,000 for a
picture extolling the virtues of modern industry.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years Rivera had his successes in the United States,
but his general failure to achieve here what he had achieved in
Mexico evidently stung him until his death, in 1957, at 71. The
hack work he churned out during his last decades (a surprising
amount of it is in the show) conveyed a cynicism perhaps born of
disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   He had basically given up mural painting by the 40s. He made
money by becoming portraitist-of-choice to rich Mexicans and
tourists from the United States. The last decade of his life
produced the occasional portrait like the exquisite one in this
show of Enriqueta Davila, austere and luminous, but mostly these
were years in decline.
</P>
<P>
   He had been right about the United States in at least one
important respect: he recognized that engineering was close to the
heart of our identity _ engineering but not painting. There are, it
is remarkable to realize, no great paintings with which we identify
as a nation, the way Mexicans identify with Rivera's murals, or for
that matter Italians with Michelangelo or Titian. aybe we're too
much enamored of the free market or too diverse culturally.
</P>
<P>
   But on the other hand, we link ourselves as a country with feats
of engineering, with the Hoover Dam and the Brooklyn Bridge and
even with Wright's Guggenheim Museum. They seem closest to the
pragmatic core of our national psyche.
</P>
<P>
   Probably because we have no equivalent to his art, we tend to
underestimate Rivera's achievement. One might say that the
circularity of his career mirrored the evolution of a century in
which cultural diversity yielded to an international style,
modernism, only to give way to a renewed respect for diversity.
</P>
<P>
   A provincial, Rivera made himself into a European modernist in
order to become a local artist again, but of course of a different
kind: modern Mexico could envision itself through his imagination,
as we, in turn, have come to see a nation through him.

PHOTOS AND DECOR FIND INSPIRATION IN JAPANESE ARTS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 21) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By RITA REIF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most people view the things they collect as a diversion from
what they do for a living. But for the Japanese photographer
Hiroshi Sugimoto, the traditional Japanese art he collects is
absolutely essential to the art he creates: compelling mages of
seascapes, waxworks, life-size Buddhas and the gilded interiors of
motion picture palaces.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to set my own standards of quality for my
photographs by comparing them with the art I collect,'' said
Sugimoto, 51. He also seeks to achieve in his work the same level
of spirituality that he finds in the medieval Japanese paintings,
plaques and calligraphies that he owns.
</P>
<P>
   While Sugimoto's photographs are exhibited widely, the art he
collects is rarely displayed, even in his homes in Tokyo and New
York. (He has divided his time between the cities since 1971.)
</P>
<P>
   Now he has lent three pieces to ``Crosscurrents: Masterpieces of
East Asian Art from New York Private Collections,'' an exhibition
that opens on Wednesday and remains through July 11 at the Japan
Society Gallery in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Organized with the Brooklyn Museum of Art by Amy G. Poster, a
pan-Asian scholar who heads the museum's Asian Art Department, the
show, of 71 objects from 32 collections, explores dominant themes
in Japanese, Chinese and Korean art: the sacred and ritualistic,
the literati tradition, the tea ceremony and nature. The show
demonstrates how each of the three cultures has transformed those
themes.
</P>
<P>
   Initiated a year ago by Alexandra Munroe when she became the
director of the Japan Society Gallery, the exhibition consists of
objects from collectors in the New York metropolitan region and was
timed to open on the eve of the International Asian Art Fair, a
central event in Asian art week in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York has become the undisputed world center for the
collecting and connoisseurship of Asian art,'' Ms. Munroe said.
``This is the first comprehensive survey of New York's collections
of East Asian art.''
</P>
<P>
   Buddhism is the most prevalent theme in sacred and ritual art in
these countries; thus the various works on view have so many
similarities that their national origins are difficult to identify.
</P>
<P>
   Each of Sugimoto's objects expresses Buddhism distinctively. A
rare 15th-century scroll painting mixes ancient Buddhist and Shinto
images: a deer with noble bearing, acting as a messenger of the
gods, is depicted descending from heaven on a cloud under images of
a golden disk and Buddhist deities as the moon rises in the
background against low hills, flowering trees and a darkened sky.
</P>
<P>
   A palm-size painted disk from the 13th century is a study of a
bodhisattva, a disciple of Buddha, seated cross-legged on a
flowering lotus, holding a book in the left hand, a sword in the
right. The image, rendered in circles within circles, illustrates a
Buddhist teaching: wisdom grows from the muddy earth to blossom in
the light of Buddhist revelation.
</P>
<P>
   And an early 13th-century calligraphy of a poem written by an
aging Buddhist monk, Myoe Koben, conveys, in visionary language and
rivulets of ink, his distress as he dreams about a Zen master
lusting after a young woman, or possibly a boy.
</P>
<P>
   The calligraphy is Sugimoto's most recent acquisition and
currently the object he most appreciates. ``He is one of my
favorite poets in all Japanese history and one of the rare
spiritual beings among Buddhist poets,'' he said of Myoe Koben.
``They call him the Japanese St. Francis, and as a 20th-century man
I am trying in my work to deal as he did with nature and the
spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   Artworks excite him most when they are new, Sugimoto said. But
he sometimes loses interest quickly, so he tries to live with
pieces before making any purchase final. ``I hang the most recent
purchase in my room and try to spend as much time as I can with it
for a few days to make sure that the impact remains for more than a
night,'' he added. ``It's like a love affair.''
</P>
<P>
   Sugimoto's collection is small: at most, 30 works. And unlike
wealthy Westerners who display their objects together in lavish
settings, he shows his pieces in the austere Japanese style,
preferably one at a time. ``Isn't it more sophisticated if you
focus instead on one object appropriate to the day?''he said. ``Who
needs 100?
</P>
<P>
   ``The art depends on whom you are inviting, the weather, the
season, the food being served,'' he added. ``And I keep a record of
what has been shown and to whom, so that I do not duplicate
anything. Guests get to see different artworks. It's a multimedia
performance, especially when there is a moon viewing. Without this
stimulation, I could not exist as an artist.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Munroe discovered what Sugimoto was talking when she visited
his Tokyo apartment last July. ``The moon rose in the early
evening, and his terrace became a moon-viewing platform,'' she
said. ``Looking at art in that kind of setting when the moon comes
to visit is a highly refined spiritual experience.''

YOUNGER MAN, BOSS' WIFE: IT'S WORTH A SEQUEL  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 21) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 Jill Gerston's most recent article for Arts and Leisure was about
the A&AMP;E series ``Biography.''  
 By JILL GERSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A successful middle-aged management consultant in a stale
marriage has a torrid affair with a sexy young surgeon, wreaking
wicked fun and tumult all around.
</P>
<P>
   It is the sort of May-December romance that Hollywood typically
casts with an aging male actor and a dewy-eyed actress young enough
to be his daughter. Think Harrison Ford and Anne Heche, Warren
Beatty and Halle Berry, Woody Allen and Elisabeth Shue. But when
seen through the lens of British television, the age gap is given a
fresh twist, along with sardonic dialogue, flawed characters, a
complicated plot and love scenes that are more discreetly sensual
than voyeuristically explicit.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the case with ``Reckless,'' a production of Granada
Television presented last year on ``Mobil Masterpiece Theater,''
starring Francesca Annis, the acclaimed British stage actress, and
Robson Green, a heartthrob from northern England who is one of
Britain's most popular television actors. Ms. Annis is 54; Green is
34.
</P>
<P>
   The six-hour series, which also features Michael Kitchen as the
arrogant, philandering husband, was a huge hit in England. When it
was broadcast here in early 1998, The New York Times critic Caryn
James called it ``a deliciously tangled story of passion,
infidelity and civilized revenge.'' ``Reckless'' was such a success
that Granada made a two-hour sequel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Masterpiece Theater'' begins rebroadcasting the original
series on PBS next Sunday night, followed by ``Reckless: The
Sequel'' on April 18.
</P>
<P>
   Although ``Reckless,'' set in present-day Manchester, isn't the
sort of classic bustle-and-breeches fare that ``Masterpiece
Theater'' is known for, Rebecca Eaton, the executive producer of
the series, said it was still in keeping with the series'
tradition.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Masterpiece Theater' made its fortune on series about people
falling in love with the wrong people, which is just what happens
in `Reckless,''' she said. ``It's a modern love story that is as
high a quality as any classic.''
</P>
<P>
   The story revolves around Owen (Green), a brash young doctor who
is infatuated with Anna (Ms. Annis), an alluring businesswoman whom
he later discovers is married to his boss, Richard (Kitchen), the
pompous chief of surgery at his hospital.
</P>
<P>
   When Anna discovers that her husband is having an affair, she
takes up with Owen, setting off a conflagration of passion,
jealousy, revenge, lies and gossip. Can such mad love last? The
sequel picks up the messy love triangle a year later.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Abbott, who created ``Reckless'' and its sequel, said his
intention was to get away from the ``slow, turgid, obsessional
relationships'' previously seen on British television and to
celebrate romance for its own sake.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we were out to prove we could bring a love story back
to television and have some fun with it,'' said Abbott, a writer
and producer of the British series ``Cracker'' and the creator of
the detective series ``Touching Evil,'' which stars Green.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott drew on his own experience in writing ``Reckless.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea for the story came from my second marriage, to a
woman who was 10 years older,'' he said in a telephone interview
from his home in Manchester. ``I met my wife when I was 21 and she
was 31. It was a wonderful relationship, but the whole thing was
dogged by her friends, who thought there was something not right in
her going with a guy 10 years younger.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People were always looking around the corner for when it would
fall apart,'' he added. ``They did that for years and years, and in
the end it doomed the relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he had relished writing the sharp, cynical dialogue of
supporting characters tut-tutting the age difference between Anna
and Owen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had such fun writing Michael Kitchen's speech in the sequel
when he screams through Owen's letterbox that every time he looks
at a woman, he'll be suspect by Anna,'' he said. ``That was the sum
voice of all the cynics who plagued us.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most Hollywood films in which the age gap between older
actors and their younger leading ladies is lightly touched on, if
at all, the age difference between Anna and Owen becomes part of
the story line in ``Reckless.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Had we not acknowledged the age difference and made it a
stumbling block, I don't think the audience would have bought it
for one minute,'' said Abbott. ``We took their cynicism and aired
it through the voices of the characters.''
</P>
<P>
   Finding the perfect twosome to play Anna and Owen with passion
and intelligence, so crucial to the success of ``Reckless,'' wasn't
easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Originally, I saw Owen as 24 and Anna as 40, so we were
looking at actors younger than Francesca and Robson,'' Abbott
recalled. ``They were all quite disappointing. They could play the
sex and the excitement, but they couldn't capture the shock and
fear of finding yourself in love with someone so much younger or
older.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Francesca was older than quite a few actresses we had looked
at, but she was the most robustly intelligent about the whole thing
and understood every twist and turn, probably for obvious reasons
in her private life,'' he said, alluding to Ms. Annis' long
relationship with the actor Ralph Fiennes, 36. ``Once we knew we
liked her, we could go with an older actor.''
</P>
<P>
   Green, who shot to stardom in the British drama series
``Soldier, Soldier,'' playing a fun-loving private, said he had
been attracted to ``Reckless'' not only because it was ``a
full-tilt romance'' but because it offered an opportunity to shed
his cheeky lad image.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reckless'' was a device that helped change the public
perception of who I was,'' said Green, speaking from the
headquarters of his production company in Newcastle. ``Owen was a
grown-up, a romantic, a man of great integrity. `Reckless' made me
into an actor in people's eyes instead of this one character from
`Soldier, Soldier.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Annis, who agreed to do `Reckless' when the part of Owen
changed from ``toy boy'' to mature doctor, said she liked the fact
that the romance centered on ``consenting adults, professionals,
with no children involved.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You couldn't have had the feel-good factor that you do if
there were children involved,'' said the actress whom ``Masterpiece
Theater'' fans know from her role as Lillie Langtry. ``People
really loved it. I had people coming up to me in the supermarket
asking, `Is she going to go off with Owen?'''
</P>
<P>
   Why don't we see more pairings of sensual 50-year-old actresses
with roguishly charming 30-year-old actors?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm generalizing, but on the whole Europe reveres grown-up
women more than America, where they have an obsession with being
very young,'' said Ms. Annis. ``In Europe, women are considered in
their prime between 38 and 50. Catherine Deneuve _ what a lucky
young man to be paired with her!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember once talking to the head of a studio about using a
film star who was about 40 at the time, and he said she was a great
actress but was too old,'' she said. ``I asked why and he said,
`What young man would want to hold her hand?' That's the way they
look at it in Hollywood.''
</P>
<P>
   After ``Reckless'' became a hit, Granada wanted Abbott to write
another six episodes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The story was completely told as far as I was concerned,'' he
said. ``How could I better the frenzy of the first series? They
have each other, and, as everyone knows, there is no drama in
people being happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, he agreed to do a two-hour sequel that finds Anna
and Owen, after living together for a year, planning to be married
within a week. The wedding announcement infuriates Richard, who
rushes back from a conference in Iceland to prevent the lovers'
walk down the aisle.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the supporting characters from the series are back _
Owen's cantankerous father, Anna's Alzheimer's-afflicted mother _
plus new ones, including Richard's uptight parents and Owen's
ex-fiancee.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott raises the emotionally charged issue of children in the
sequel (Owen wants them, Anna is resigned to not having any), which
could jeopardize a happy ending.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all reality, I think the baby thing would crop up,'' he
said. ``Had they broached the subject in the first `Reckless,' they
probably never would have gotten around to talking about marriage.
But we bring that question to the fore in the sequel.''
</P>
<P>
   Abbott, who never expected the original ``Reckless'' to be such
a smash, said he was stunned that the sequel was just as big a hit
in Britain. ``A television critic, who had once suggested about a
movie I had written that my computer be taken away from me, wrote
that in this case I deserved free drinks for life,'' he recalled.
``I obviously believe in people falling in love, age
notwithstanding.''

HEWING TO BOTH MUSICAL AND RACIAL ROOTS IN BRAZIL  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 21) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By BEN RATLIFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALVADOR, Brazil _ In Salvador, the capital of Brazil's state of
Bahia, which has one of the richest carnival traditions in the new
world, all the connoisseurs of Bahia's Carnaval have the same thing
jotted down in their agendas: to attend the start of the Ile Aiye
parade.
</P>
<P>
   Ile Aiye (pronounced Ee-leh Eye-eh) is one of the various
carnival organizations, called blocos, that sponsor floats and
parades throughout the six-day street festival that engulfs this
city.
</P>
<P>
   But of all of them it is perhaps the purest. Its
percussion-and-voice band has refused to go pop, sticking to the
slow, stately Ijexa rhythms _ an African sort of samba associated
with the Afro-Brazilian religion of candomble. It insists on
walking through the streets rather than riding on a sound truck the
way other bands do.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike the rest of the ``blocos afro'' that followed Ile
Aiye's lead, springing into existence since the 1970s, Ile Aiye
stubbornly stresses the ``afro'' part: it still does not admit
whites, or even mixed-race Brazilians, into its organization.
</P>
<P>
   But that policy doesn't keep people of all skin tones from
visiting Ile Aiye's headquarters, a small two-story house on a
steep hill in the city's large black neighborhood called Libertade.
Inside the house recently, the group was preparing for its big
night.
</P>
<P>
   In the back room, where strips of paper hanging from the ceiling
marked it as a house of candomble, this year's young ``queen'' of
the bloco was being fitted with an elaborate headdress of silvery
fabric. In an anteroom, four women, elders of Ile Aiye, sat dressed
in the fluffy white costumes associated with the state of Bahia.
</P>
<P>
   At the appointed moment, the women filed out into the street,
throwing hominy and popcorn and flour around them. Some 150
drummers in red, white, black and yellow shirts _ the colors of Ile
Aiye _ assembled into a column in the street, with a conductor at
the head. The drummers started a slow, thick, lurching two-beat
rhythm, with the emphasis on the second beat.
</P>
<P>
   Fireworks exploded from the crest of the hill. A trumpet fanfare
sounded from the second-floor balcony of the house, and a number of
officials _ including Antonio Carlos Santos de Vovo (known simply
as Vovo), Ile Aiye's leader, and Antonio Imbassay, the mayor of
Salvador, released doves into the air. The rhythm quickened, and
then Ile Aiye set off on a 12-mile march, which ended in the center
of town six hours later.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Ile Aiye's 25 years offers a window on some of the
ambiguities of racial politics in Salvador, Brazil's oldest city.
Depending on whom you're talking to, race is either the most
overrated or underrated topic in the city, whose government is
predominantly white but whose population is 75 percent black.
</P>
<P>
   Racial discrimination is illegal, and for an outsider it's as
easy to see Salvador as a multicolored paradise of racial tolerance
as it is to notice that the darkest-skinned people live at the
bottom of the economic ladder.
</P>
<P>
   Ile Aiye's founding was an act of courage: at the time, Brazil's
military dictatorship forbade any kind of social activism or
protest. But now its policy of limiting membership to only the
darkest black Bahians seems hard to justify, at least to a North
American.
</P>
<P>
   Even Margareth Menezes, a popular singer from Bahia, has been
denied admission; she was judged not black enough. In a region with
a wide range of skin tones, only the darkest are considered black
at all.
</P>
<P>
   But Bahians, for the most part, don't see Ile Aiye's exclusion
policy as an insult; they consider its beautiful Afro-Brazilian
music acts as a sort of cultural home base that's very much needed
in the increasingly commercial atmosphere of Carnaval. The group's
music is best heard on a new disk just released on Natasha records
in Brazil, called ``Ile Aiye 25 Anos,'' only the fourth recording
the Ile Aiye has made.
</P>
<P>
   Vovo, the group's leader, talked about the history of Ile Aiye a
few days after the march in the Bahian vacation house of the singer
Caetano Veloso, a longtime supporter. Vovo is a tall, heavyset man
in his 50s, and he spoke in a soft, quick Portuguese.
</P>
<P>
   He said the idea for a strictly black bloco occurred to him and
a friend in 1974, when Brazil was absorbing the racial-pride songs
of James Brown and Bob Marley. ``We wanted to create a group whose
name was `Black Power,''' Vovo said as Veloso translated. ``But we
wanted that in Yoruba. A man from the Federal Police who lived in
Libertade, an acquaintance of ours, advised us not to use this name
because it could be dangerous for us.'' (During Brazil's
anticommunist military dictatorship, anything that looked like a
cultural movement could be considered Communist.)
</P>
<P>
   ``So, I talked with my mother and some other friends about
choosing a name,'' Vovo continued, ``and finally we arrived at Ile
Aiye. It means `big house' in Yoruba, but in our minds it means
`black world.'''
</P>
<P>
   The bloco's theme song, written by Paulinho Camafeu, a member of
Ile Aiye, and made famous by Gilberto Gil's recorded version in
1977, carries the message of pride that suffuses Ile Aiye. ``What
bloco is this?'' go its translated lyrics. ``I want to know/ It's
the black world that we have come to show you/ We're crazy blacks,
we're really cool ... / White, if you knew the value of black/
You'd take a tar bath and become black, too.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ile Aiye rehearses once a week during the year, and sometimes
more than a thousand people come to dance, sing and join in with
the group; during most of the year, rehearsals are free and open to
the public. Closer to the time of Carnaval, admission is charged,
but it's clear that the bloco offers a healthy counterbalance to
the pop commercialism of the wealthy blocos, like those built
around the groups Crocodilo and Banda Eva, which charge hundreds of
dollars for upper-middle-class Brazilians to wear their special
shirts and to dance inside a cordoned area behind its sound truck
during Carnaval.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, the city has given Ile Aiye increasing respect and
financial support.
</P>
<P>
   The days of the segregated carnival _ when whites in Bahia would
celebrate in private balls _ have been gone for more than 20 years.
But there is still an undercurrent of tension about racism in
Bahia. This year, even TV Globo, the powerful conglomerate that
owns radio stations, newspapers and a national television station
in Brazil, flirted with the subject in a news story.
</P>
<P>
   There is widespread speculation that some of the wealthier
blocos unofficially exclude blacks and poor Bahians by means of
their admissions process: they ask for a photograph and residential
address before allowing applicants to participate and buy a shirt.
</P>
<P>
   In TV Globo's report, which was shown during Carnaval this year,
Vovo was seen on television affirming these speculations,
presumably as a talking head in opposition to racism. But there is
obvious hypocrisy at play: Vovo is the leader of the only group in
Bahia that officially turns people away because of the color of
their skin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two or three days after the television show,'' Vovo recalled,
smiling at the irony, ``I was on a radio station here giving
another interview, and it occurred to me that the only racist in
Bahia is me.''
</P>
<P>
   The night of the march, a yellow flier was handed out by a
member of Ile Aiye. It accused the local government of favoring the
commercial groups when handing out money to the blocos. There was
no indication that it was an official document of the bloco, but it
was widely distributed.
</P>
<P>
   Later that night, on a reviewing stand in downtown Salvador, the
mayor waved the flier away as a piece of rabble-rousing, denying
that there was an imbalance in financial support.
</P>
<P>
   ``This piece of paper doesn't represent any major thought,'' he
said. ``It's just an idea from a small group or an individual. The
blocos afro, like Ile Aiye _ they're not businesses; they're from
the heart. They try to send a message of peace, of freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   He measured the commercial blocos against the blocos afro:
``Both are important to the city: one increases the economy, and
the other maintains the identity. And the government has to help
the group that doesn't have enough money to put on a show.'' Two
days later the mayor encouraged Ile Aiye to arrive downtown at 8
p.m. sharp, so as to pass in front of the television cameras during
prime time.
</P>
<P>
   Ile Aiye's exclusionism even extends to its repertory: it plays
no songs written by members outside the group (with the sole
exception of ``Um Canto de Afoxe Para O Bloco do Ile,'' composed in
1982 by Veloso, who is considered white, and his son Moreno).
</P>
<P>
   The group's expression of black power has softened a little; it
now includes songs that Vovo calls ``Afro-romantic.'' One of them,
``Deusa do Ebano,'' is on the ``Ile Aiye 25 Anos'' record. ``I have
wandered alone,'' the lyrics go. ``You're not here in the street/
and I am nothing without you/ I'm going to Ile Aiye to find you/
oh! my beautiful black woman/ oh! my ebony goddess/ the black
culture of Ile Aiye is inscribed on her naked body.''
</P>
<P>
   Most Bahians understand that Ile Aiye's racial policies are a
form of benign idealism; Vovo says that if they should ever be
ruled illegal, he would change them in a heartbeat. In the
meantime, he's sticking to the way things are. On his car is an Ile
Aiye sticker that reads, somewhat cryptically, ``Do not forget: the
path of stubbornness is backed by faith.''

BRAZIL'S NATIONAL TREASURE HAS EYE ON OSCAR  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 21) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ The first time it occurred to Fernanda
Montenegro that she could win an Academy Award for best actress was
at the Berlin Film Festival early last year, before she and the
film ``Central Station'' had won the festival's top prizes. At
breakfast one morning, the movie's producer, Arthur Cohn, turned to
her and said: ``You know, you're going to get an Oscar nomination
out of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Cohn has five Oscars of his own for foreign films and
documentaries, his opinion is not to be dismissed lightly. At the
time, though, his prediction seemed far-fetched, Ms. Montenegro
recalled during an interview at her Ipanema apartment here a few
days before heading to Hollywood and Sunday night's award
ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I regarded it with disbelief, as simply a compliment, a
warmer, nicer way of saying `Have a pleasant day,''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, the odds would seem to be stacked against her. At age
69, Ms. Montenegro has acted in just nine movies, and until
``Central Station,'' in which she plays an embittered former
schoolteacher who becomes a letter writer for illiterate people in
order to eke out a living, only a couple had been released in the
United States. There, she said, ``the only time they are likely
turn up is when someone is organizing a Brazilian or Latin American
film festival.''
</P>
<P>
   Filmed in Portuguese with a limited budget and a semidocumentary
style, even ``Central Station'' is a ``small'' movie by Hollywood
standards. But Ms. Montenegro's performance as the cynical,
exhausted Dora is so powerful and commanding, so intertwined with
the movie's tale of redemption, that critics and audiences have
responded to it with lavish praise and wonderment.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the very start, the role of Dora was written with her in
mind,'' said Walter Salles, 41, the Brazilian director of ``Central
Station.'' ``I had seen a lot of her theater work and all of the
films she had done, and what struck me is that she always brings an
integrity to the characters she plays, an interpretation with so
many layers it is impossible not to be fascinated.''
</P>
<P>
   That was important, Salles said, because Dora was meant to
strike the audience as unsympathetic at first but then to become
more human as she rediscovers her capacity for love through a
relationship with a boy whose mother has died.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew Fernanda would feel a sense of solidarity with the
character and not judge her,'' Salles said. ``That courage to dive
into the abyss is what makes her one of the best actresses not just
in Brazil but in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Long before ``Central Station,'' though, Brazilians considered
Ms. Montenegro a national treasure. In a career that has spanned
more than 50 years, she has performed not only in films but for the
theater, radio and television.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been from one end of this country to the other probably
30 times,'' she said, a practice that has made her almost as
recognizable to her countrymen as the soccer star Pele or a pop
star like Gilberto Gil.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1959, Ms. Montenegro and her husband of 45 years, the
director and actor Fernando Torres, have also managed their own
theater company, going door to door trying to raise money from
corporations and mounting productions of modern and classic plays,
which they take on the road to large cities and small towns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything we have, the theater has given us,'' she said. ``We
live in the world of the theater, doing plays our entire lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Most recently the couple collaborated on Chekhov's ``Sea Gull,''
which traveled to eight Brazilian cities last year. But over the
years, responding to what she describes as ``a fever, a flame, a
need'' to explore the craft of acting, Ms. Montenegro has also
performed in works by Edward Albee, Samuel Beckett, Arthur Miller,
Eugene O'Neill, Harold Pinter, Moliere, Pirandello, Racine, Shaw
and Brazil's greatest modern playwright, Nelson Rodrigues, with
occasional forays into the terrain of Neil Simon and Noel Coward.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fernanda has an infinite capacity and disposition for work,
and never considers any performance finished,'' said Jose Wilker,
the Brazilian actor known to foreign audiences for his roles in
``Dona Flor and Her Two Husbands'' and ``Bye Bye Brazil.'' ``A play
can have run for two years and it's always a work in progress to
her, a chance to find a new way to read her character. That is
something rare and admirable,'' he continued. ``After all, many
people have talent, but not all have the vocation, that inner
call.''
</P>
<P>
   On the frothy television soap operas that are the backbone of
Brazilian prime time entertainment, Ms. Montenegro is almost always
cast as ``the rich woman, the elegant, well-dressed magnate's wife
who lives in a big mansion,'' she said. While many American actors
of comparable stature would shun such roles, she does not have that
luxury. ``We live a different reality here,'' she said. ``Nobody
can make a living just from acting for films.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, she added, ``if I accept a role, I always do it with
maximum effort and position myself honestly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't disparage it. I throw myself into it. Why am I going
to limit myself? If I see an interesting role with a good script
and a good cast, why refuse to participate? After all, in the 19th
century, Balzac and Dostoevsky wrote serials, which were the
equivalent of what television is today.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Montenegro said she would like to have had more
opportunities to act in movies, ``since I am from a generation
that, from the time we could sit in our mothers' laps, went to the
movies three or four times a week to savor the dreams we saw on the
screen.'' But financing is so hard to come by here, and theaters so
suspicious of the commercial prospects of local product, that all
but the most dedicated filmmakers give up.
</P>
<P>
   So when she was offered the role of Dora, Ms. Montenegro said:
``I didn't hesitate a minute. I thought that this was a character
so rich, so hard to come across in movies, or even the theater,
that I couldn't afford to pass it up. This is a character living a
deep internal crisis, a woman at the end of the line, the end of
her career, who is scorned and is closing in on herself.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   If there is a burden to her prestige here at home, it is that
she carries into Sunday night's Academy Awards ceremonies the hopes
of 165 million of her fellow citizens at a time when Brazil is
mired in a deep fiscal crisis and desperate for a piece of good
news.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the Oscar nominations were announced last month, she
said, street sweepers, postal carriers and store clerks have been
giving her the thumbs-up sign and shouting, ``We're praying for
you!'' when they see her pass on the street.
</P>
<P>
   To audiences in the United States and even her American peers,
however, Ms. Montenegro seems to have appeared out of nowhere,
``like a creature arriving from Jupiter,'' as she puts it with an
amused laugh. Struggling to place her in context, critics have
compared her looks and technique to those of Giulietta Masina and
Anna Magnani, the Italian actresses who were the bulwarks of the
post-World War II neo-realist movement.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Montenegro finds the description both flattering and
incisive, and not just because ``my maternal grandparents came from
Italy barely 30 years before I was born,'' in Jacarepagua, a Rio
suburb.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Italians showed the Third World that you didn't need a big
budget to make a good movie, that there was an alternative to
Hollywood's way of doing things, and that esthetic infected a whole
generation of filmmakers in Brazil,'' she said. ``It was one of our
directors from the Cinema Novo period, Glauber Rocha, who talked
about needing just an idea in the head and a camera in the hand &UR;  &LR; to
make a movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Ms. Montenegro said she is an adherent of what another
Brazilian director, Arnaldo Jabor, calls the ``esthetic of
hunger.'' As she puts it, ``the country's social problems are
always there,'' creating ``a world that is sad but very rich'' in
potential for storytelling.
</P>
<P>
   Though she now lives quite comfortably, Ms. Montenegro, born
Arlette Pinheiro Esteves da Silva, grew up in a working class
family, daughter of a mechanic for the Rio power company. At the
age of 15, though, she answered a call to audition for the state
radio station here, was selected for radio announcer's training,
took the surname of her family doctor as her stage name, and has
been working virtually nonstop ever since.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's not a Hepburn or a Redgrave, a grand dame,'' said Ms.
Montenegro's daughter, Fernanda Torres, herself an actress. ``They
call her the first lady of the Brazilian theater, which makes her
laugh because she is much closer to being Dora than a diva. She has
traveled on those crowded trains you see in `Central Station' and
knows those neighborhoods.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Torres, who in 1986 won the best actress award at the Cannes
International Film Festival for her performance in ``Eu Sei Que Vou
Te Amar'' (``Love Me Forever and Ever''), described her mother as a
``strong and wise'' parent. Once on stage, however, Ms. Montenegro
``is ferocious, a lioness,'' said Ms. Torres, who played opposite
her mother in ``The Crash and Flash Days,'' a 1992 play at Lincoln
Center. ``She comes into a scene like Mike Tyson ready to bite off
Evander Holyfield's ear.''
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, she is also demanding and relentless, on
herself and others, in rehearsal. ``Everyone will be exhausted, but
she will say `Let's do one more run-through,''' Ms. Torres said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, ``working with her is a lot of fun,'' said Wilker,
who has performed opposite Ms. Montenegro in several soap operas.
``At the same time that she is very cultured, intelligent and well
read, she has a great sense of intuition, and as an actor it's
quite enjoyable to be challenged to keep pace with that intuition
and try to give something back to her.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Montenegro recognizes that at her age and with her less than
perfect command of English _ good enough for her to appear on
``Late Night with David Letterman'' recently, but not strong enough
for her to perform in the language _job offers from Hollywood are
not likely to come showering down on her. But then making a career
abroad has never been her top priority. And though ``this
recognition by critics, audiences and the academy is something so
beautiful and unexpected,'' neither is it a priority now.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have great actors and actresses right here, and wonderful
stories to tell,'' she said firmly. ``I wouldn't change my life
experience for that of any actor in any other culture. Being an
actor in Brazil is like living an adventure that never ends.''

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 21)  
 (af)  
 By RACHEL L. SWARNS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ He is wry and witty, the very picture of a promising
young playwright, with his blue jeans, his black leather jacket and
his California cool. But in his mind's eye, he is still clumsy and
awkward, a gawky crow craving acceptance from a tribe of graceful
sparrows. And it is this metaphor, he says, that best reflects his
existence as a gay Chinese-American writer struggling to succeed in
a white world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's how I see myself in America, living on the periphery and
longing to be in the midst of it,'' said Chay Yew, 33, one of a
handful of critically acclaimed Asian-American writers working in
the theater in this country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like when you go to a bar,'' said Yew, whose newest play,
``Red,'' opens on Tuesday at the Manhattan Theater Club Stage 2.
``You see all these guys. They're having a good time and you want
to be like them. But you know you never can. I've learned to
actually say, `It's O.K. to be who you are.' But it hasn't been
easy.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, he explained over coffee in midtown Manhattan, he
felt pressured _by Americans and by Asians _ to be someone he was
not. His parents urged him to abandon art for medicine. A white
professor refused to cast him in a college show because he didn't
``look the part.''
</P>
<P>
   When he started writing plays, some Asian-American artists
railed against his gay themes. The actors refused to audition. A
theater board member quit in protest. And Yew's blood began to
boil. From that fury, ``Red'' was born.
</P>
<P>
   The play, directed by David Petrarca, explores the Cultural
Revolution in China and the brutal crackdown on artists that began
in the 1960s. It reflects Yew's outrage at society's efforts to
rein in his own artistic sensibilities and, he said, at Republicans
in Congress who have sought to regulate artists by reducing support
for the National Endowment for the Arts.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Red,'' the ghost of a Peking Opera star haunts an abandoned
theater in Shanghai, where he was murdered for refusing to recast
his songs for the Communist regime. He is discovered by Sonja Wong
Pickford, a best-selling Chinese-American romance author who writes
bodice-rippers like ``Love in the Jade Pagoda'' and ``Bound Feet,
Bound Lives.''
</P>
<P>
   She visits the theater to research her first serious book and
ends up coming to terms with herself, her art and her history. The
cast includes Jodi Long, who portrays Sonja, and Ric Young, who
plays Hua, the opera singer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Red,'' which grapples with broader issues than Yew's previous
works, was presented last year at the Intiman Theater in Seattle;
the current production was produced at the Long Wharf Theater in
New Haven in January.
</P>
<P>
   Yew's earlier plays include the well-received ``A Language of
Their Own,'' about gay men struggling with relationships, AIDS and
society. ``Red'' takes on government censorship and also critiques
Asian-American artists who censor themselves and their stories to
appeal to Western and Asian audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Yew pokes fun at artists who exoticize the Asian experience with
clanging gongs, silk robes and weeping women rescued by handsome
white Americans. ``I call them `Chinky-American experience plays,'
and I hate them,'' he said cheerfully.
</P>
<P>
   When it was pointed out that gongs, somersaults and rapidly
unfurling red silk curtains figure prominently in ``Red,'' he
grinned and said, ``But I destroy them all by the second act.''
</P>
<P>
   David Henry Hwang, perhaps America's most prominent
Asian-American playwright, said that today more young writers were
using their ethnicity as a point of entry to explore broader issues
beyond identity. Hwang, who lives in Manhattan, mentioned Yew as
well as Diana Son, who wrote ``Stop Kiss,'' a widely praised play
about a brutal attack on a gay woman, recently seen at the Joseph
Papp Public Theater. The play depicts the budding romance between
two women, one white and one Asian, but never discusses race.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a lot of writers in my generation it was a new idea to
think of ourselves as Asian-American, and that's what we focused
on,'' said Hwang, 41, who won a Tony Award in 1988 for his play
``M. Butterfly.'' ``The younger generation sees it simply as one
piece in the larger mosaic. And Chay is the most powerful voice out
of this wave of Asian-American playwrights.''
</P>
<P>
   Yew, whose home is in Los Angeles, said he still felt like an
outsider in America and in Singapore, where he was born and lived
until he was 16. But increasingly, he said, he uses ``a larger
canvas.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``There will always be elements of gayness and
Asian-American-ness in my work,'' he said. ``But I think I'm
concerned with the world a lot more. After the 60s and 70s, there
was this questioning of who and what we are, where we come from. In
the 90s, we say to ourselves, `We now know who we are, but how do
we live with ourselves and the world at large?' ''
</P>
<P>
   To explore the issues of art and censorship, Yew had only to
look at his own life. When he was a boy, his grandmother took him
to Chinese street operas in Singapore, where actors erected stages
in bustling markets and old men painted their faces to become
warriors or concubines. It was his first taste of the theater.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up under an authoritarian government in Singapore, Yew
was aware of the power of censorship. But as a teen-ager at
Pepperdine University in Malibu, Calif., he learned first hand, he
said, when a professor refused him a part because he was Asian. Yew
recalled: ``I told him, `You think I'm going to be playing ``The
King and I'' for the rest of my life? No way.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In Singapore, where he staged his first play in 1987, government
censors rejected the work because it included a gay character. Yew
said he rewrote the play, eliminating obvious references to the
character's sexuality, but encouraged the actor playing the part to
hint at the character's sexual preference.
</P>
<P>
   And in Los Angeles, during auditions in 1995 for ``A Language of
Their Own,'' he found himself forced to post special signs so Asian
actors would know what they were getting into. ``They were coming
in and saying, `It's gay?' and walking out,'' Yew said. ``So we had
to put up a sign, like a warning: `Gay-themed play.' It made me so
angry.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most painful for Yew was the reaction of his father,
who refused to discuss his son's homosexuality or to see any of his
plays, Yew said, adding that his father has since apologized for
missing them.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the obstacles, or maybe because of them, Yew developed
an authorial voice. Speaking of ``A Language of Their Own,'' which
had its first reading in New York at the Public Theater, George C.
Wolfe, the theater's producer, said: ``Chay finds the intimacy in
the characters and the language. And that's what affects people.
You find yourself in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Praise for Yew's work has not been universal. Tsai Chin, the
actress who played Auntie Lindo in the film ``The Joy Luck Club,''
gave Yew the idea for ``Red'' when he told her he wanted to write
about censorship. She shared the story of her father, a Chinese
opera singer who played male roles and was purged during the
Cultural Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, she complained, Yew employed the very
stereotypes he deplores, creating a male character who performs as
a woman and playing into Western stereotypes of Asian-American men
as effete.
</P>
<P>
   ``People tend to put emphasis on the female impersonator because
that's the only thing Western people understand,'' Ms. Chin said by
telephone from Los Angeles. ``It's perpetuating the cliche. It's
exactly what I didn't want to happen. I wanted a good playwright to
project another image of Chinese art.''
</P>
<P>
   Yew said he used ``familiar'' images in the first act of ``Red''
so he could destroy them later to make larger points about
censorship, father-daughter relations and art. And he dedicated
``Red'' to Ms. Chin, even though she dislikes the play. He is,
after all, no stranger to criticism.

LONGING FOR LOVE, FINDING ONLY SEX AND SOLITUDE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 21) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ANDREA STEVENS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The American sex industry as theatrical muse? Well, why not? In
1996, the British dramatist Patrick Marber brought his first play
to America, ``Dealer's Choice,'' a black comedy in which six men
play poker around a table while competing in a savage survival of
the slickest.
</P>
<P>
   One night in Atlanta, where the play was part of the Olympics
festival, the all-male British cast, as Marber remembers it, ``went
on a boys' night out to a strip club.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an up-market strip joint,'' Marber said. ``The concept
didn't exist in London then, though it does now. They've all been
imported over _ these lap-dancing clubs, where the notion is that
it's a sexual transaction and a money transaction. Kind of like a
human casino. A casino of flesh.''
</P>
<P>
   Marber, who is now 34, was curious: ``The men there were not the
kind of cliched meatheads you'd expect, but just ordinary
professional men like myself. I wanted to take it on, on some
level.''
</P>
<P>
   The result is ``Closer,'' his bitter, darkly comic prize-winning
English play about sex and longing. Underlying themes of betrayal
and competition are signified early on in a notoriously ribald
scene in which two male strangers correspond in a cyberspace chat
room, one posing as a sexually hungry woman, the other happy to
believe it.
</P>
<P>
   The play, which won the triple crown in England _ the Olivier,
The Evening Standard and the Critics' Circle awards _ opens on
Thursday at the Music Box Theater on Broadway. Natasha Richardson
co-stars with Rupert Graves, Anna Friel and Ciaran Hinds, the lone
holdover from London. The author is directing, as he did with
``Dealer's Choice.''
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Sunday night between rehearsals, Marber described
how he wrote his second play, about four people who meet, pair off,
switch partners and separate. Compact, with dark hair and very
white skin, he spoke intensely, rarely hesitating. ``The first
scene that got written was the strip club. I had this girl who is a
stripper and I had this guy. I found out who she was; I found out
who he was. I had two instruments, but the play didn't sing with
just two. At one point, there were three couples, and then I
realized I didn't need three; I needed two for a string quartet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of if A meets B, and then meets C, how's D going to
feel about it? Some critics of the play have said it's algebra and
not true to life. Of course it's not true to life; it's a play.
It's kind of virtual reality.''
</P>
<P>
   After composing the first draft, Marber said, ``I read Noel
Coward's `Private Lives' again and thought, `Yeah, there are
parallels here.' It owes a lot to Racine. I directed a version of
`Andromache' in London, and I was very taken with the rigorousness
of his structure. I'd also done an updated version of `Miss Julie'
for British television. So the sexual politics were in my mix, and
stuff in my friends' lives, in my own.''
</P>
<P>
   An Oxford graduate, Marber tried the life of a stand-up comic
for a few years, a job he describes as lonely. Loneliness is a
subject that also interests him. ``The condition of `Closer' is
solitude,'' he said. ``None of the characters know each other at
the beginning, and none are going to see each other again at the
end. It is quite influenced by a book by Roland Barthes called `A
Lover's Discourse,' where he talks about the nature of love being a
condition of solitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's why the play is called `Closer,' because it was
the idea that the closer you get to someone, you might feel your
own solitude more deeply. The condition of being in love is to feel
your own being more profoundly, and to recognize your own singular
humanity. I think we all have that feeling when we're in love.''
</P>
<P>
   Is he?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yeah.''
</P>
<P>
   How does he know?
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose when I say the words, it doesn't feel like I'm
lying.''

A LIVE-WIRE CLIMBER FROM AUSTRALIA  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 21) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 Margy Rochlin's most recent article for the Arts and Leisure
section was about the director Risa Bramon Garcia.  
 By MARGY ROCHLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Even before she made her first movie, Rachel
Griffiths's face was famous. She first realized this back home in
Australia while sitting in a Melbourne movie house watching Martin
Scorsese's 1991 remake of the thriller ``Cape Fear.''
</P>
<P>
   In it, Robert De Niro's oily convict stalks a teen-ager played
by Juliette Lewis, who has the same high forehead as Ms. Griffiths,
as well as the same full mouth, large eyes and short dark hair.
Being presented with so many similarities writ so very large was
almost too much for Ms. Griffiths.
</P>
<P>
   ``When she came on the screen, I turned to my best friend and we
both went, `This is (italics)scary,'''(end italics) said Ms.
Griffiths, who, had she felt like it, could have held an impromptu
autograph-signing session afterward. ``When I walked out of the
theater, everybody was just staring at me.''
</P>
<P>
   In the business of acting, such look-alike recognition can be a
minus when just starting out. But with a co-starring role in the
international hit ``Muriel's Wedding'' three years later, Ms.
Griffiths made the first big step toward helping the public connect
her own name to her face. For her portrayal of Muriel's party-girl
sidekick, Ms. Griffiths took home her country's version of the
Oscar for best supporting actress and wound up with theatrical
representatives wrangling deals for her around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zimbabwe is the one country in the world where I don't have an
agent,'' kidded Ms. Griffiths. ``But I've been told not to take it
too personally. I think there's a revolution going on there.''
</P>
<P>
   In the span of seven months Ms. Griffiths will have appeared in
three British films _ ``Hilary and Jackie,'' ``Among Giants,''
which opens Friday, and Hanif Kureishi's June release ``My Son, the
Fanatic'' _ and one worldwide television event.
</P>
<P>
   At the Academy Awards ceremony Sunday night, a camera will be
trained on Ms. Griffiths as she finds out whether she has won the
Oscar for best supporting actress for her performance in ``Hilary
and Jackie.''
</P>
<P>
   As pressurized as this moment will be, it may not compare to
what ensued last January, when Ms. Griffiths found herself in the
middle of ``a furor,'' as she called it, over ``Hilary and
Jackie.'' The film is based on ``Genius in the Family,'' a scathing
tell-all memoir co-written by Hilary du Pre and her brother Piers
about their revered cellist sister Jacqueline du Pre, who died of
multiple sclerosis in 1987. (The book has been released here under
the same title as the movie.)
</P>
<P>
   Details include how Hilary du Pre's husband, Christopher Finzi,
slept with Jacqueline to help her overcome her shaky emotional
state.
</P>
<P>
   When Ms. Griffiths arrived in London for the British premiere of
the film, she found herself repeatedly defending Hilary, whom Ms.
Griffiths portrays.
</P>
<P>
   The media frenzy was sparked in part by composer Andrew Lloyd
Webber's cellist brother, Julian Lloyd Webber. Julian, portraying
himself as one of Jacqueline's close friends, was widely quoted
denouncing the film's depiction of Jacqueline (played by Emily
Watson) as ``deeply sordid'' and ``sick.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hilary du Pre has nothing but praise for Ms. Griffiths's
portrayal of her as a caretaker for her sister (and expresses
disdain for Julian Lloyd Webber, saying in a telephone interview
from her home in Berkshire, England, ``Jackie absolutely loathed
him and loathed his playing.'')
</P>
<P>
   As for what it was like to spend two hours watching Ms.
Griffiths act out all the love and despair of her caretaker
relationship with her sibling, Ms. du Pre could only rave.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like she crept into my soul and became me,'' said Ms.
du Pre, who has, at last count, seen ``Hilary and Jackie'' 11
times, sobbing all the way through on each occasion, she said.
``She has amazing ability,'' she said of Ms. Griffiths. ``You know,
Rachel is a loud, very noisy person. I'm quieter.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it is unlikely that Ms. Griffiths would ever get lost in
a crowd. Seated in the patio restaurant of Hollywood's Chateau
Marmont hotel, she is dressed in an ankle-length gray skirt, a
sleeveless blouse and the kind of tennis hat most often found on
the heads of old men. To a skinny, bespectacled man leaning out of
his hotel room window, Ms. Griffiths yelled, ``Hey, sexy!'' (He
turned out to be the director of ``Hilary and Jackie,'' Anand
Tucker.)
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Griffiths is accustomed to being cast as the live wire,
taking parts like the pig farmer's lusty daughter in ``Jude'' or
the spiteful debutante in ``My Best Friend's Wedding'' and making
the most of her brief moments onscreen. In fact, it took a lot of
coaxing by Tucker to convince her that she was right for the role
of the self-restrained housewife Hilary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just couldn't see me in the role at all,'' Ms. Griffith
said. ``I mean, I'd love to be the beautiful, quiet, enigmatic
type, but I'm not.''
</P>
<P>
   What she is, however, is harder to define. Ms. Griffiths, 31, is
the only daughter of Anna Griffiths, an arts and education
consultant and her ex-husband Edward, a welfare fund-raiser. Born
in the coastal town of Newcastle, the Griffiths clan (she has two
brothers, Ben and Sam) moved to Melbourne when she was 6.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond that there is almost no question about Ms.
Griffiths's background too innocuous to receive the ``I don't talk
about that'' response. Thank Blythe Danner, Gwyneth Paltrow's
mother, for this.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just read this great interview where Gwyneth said her mother
told her never to talk about her love life, her family or the
movies that she might have said no to,'' Ms. Griffiths said.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, the Danner Principle doesn't cover the discussion of
one's artistic training. ``A really great apprenticeship,'' was how
Ms. Griffiths characterized her stint with a government-subsidized
regional theater company after graduating from Victorian College of
the Arts in Melbourne.
</P>
<P>
   At age 23, she starred as a spy on a television series called
``Secrets.'' ``I got to be passive and watchful,'' said Ms.
Griffiths, who three weeks after the series was canceled, could be
found on the ``Muriel's Wedding'' set, reverting to the good time
girl that her co-stars know, and apparently love.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's fearless,'' was how the actor Pete Postlewaite responded
when asked about his partner for his first romantic leading role,
in ``Among Giants.'' In the film, written by Simon Beaufoy (``The
Full Monty''), Postlewaite plays a lonely middle-aged foreman who
falls for Ms. Griffiths's free-spirit rock climber Gerry when he
hires her for his crew of day laborers painting electrical towers
along northern England's rolling hills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once Rachel decides to do something, she just goes for it,''
said Postlewaite, noting a scene in ``Among Giants'' in which the
lovers shed their clothes and wander through an abandoned water
cistern. ``What a day! There were no inhibitions!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty comfortable in my body, except when I start to
think, `Have I got cellulite?''' said Ms. Griffiths, whose hazy
retelling of her and Postlewaite's bare frolic had nothing to do
with Ms. Paltrow's mother's rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the scene, we're supposed to be walking drunk and naked
through this glorious site,'' said Ms. Griffiths. ``So we just had
a couple of beers, Pete and me. I can't really remember the day.''

TAKING ON THE WAR BETWEEN THE COASTS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 21)
</HEADLINE>
 (af) 
By BRUCE NEWMAN  
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In the ceaseless civic sniping between New York
and this redoubt of surface charm and deep faults, everybody always
talks about the weather, but nobody ever does anything about it.
Until now.
</P>
<P>
   In what at first appears to be a new skirmish in this culture
war, the ABC sitcom ``It's Like, You Know ... '' surveys the L.A.
landscape _ where the people are as convertible as the cars they
drive _ and quickly runs up the flag of surrender.
</P>
<P>
   As one of the transplanted New Yorkers in this show explains to
a newly landed apostate: ``You're going to be like everyone else,
talking about how you hate L.A.,'' how the people are so dumb, so
plastic, so silicone, how you have to drive to take a walk, the
murder trials last two years, and the marriages last two months.
Then ``one warm afternoon, you play softball and you think to
yourself, `My God, it's January.' ''
</P>
<P>
   What charms beyond the weather this city holds for its tired,
its poor, its brain-dead, non-softball-playing huddled masses are
to be revealed, elliptically, during a six-week trial run of ``It's
Like, You Know ... '' beginning this Wednesday night at 8:30.
</P>
<P>
   It somehow makes sense that the stranger in this strange land
should be played by the most irritatingly smug New Yorker
imaginable, which naturally led the show's producers to Chris
Eigeman, who came to prominence nine years ago as the chatty churl
in the Whit Stillman film ``Metropolitan.''
</P>
<P>
   Eigeman suspects that his performance in that conversation piece
about New York debutantes had a lot to do with his being cast as
Arthur, the thinly disguised alter ego of Peter Mehlman, the
creator of ``It's Like, You Know. ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of people in the world who don't think I'm an
actor at all,'' says Eigeman, flexing his supercilium subtly.
``They think that `Metropolitan' was a very, very well-produced
documentary.''
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear to Eigeman, and others, what these same people
will make of ``It's Like, You Know ... ,'' which eviscerates Los
Angeles with great affection _ and affectation. There is already a
body of thought that the show may be too different from everything
else currently on television to find a sizable audience.
</P>
<P>
   And some of that skepticism comes from people involved in making
the show. A.J. Langer, who observed the protracted death throes of
``My So-Called Life'' as a regular on that ABC series, worries that
the network may be similarly ambivalent about this show.
</P>
<P>
   ``The same thing is happening,'' says Ms. Langer, who plays a
process-serving masseuse this time. ``The network is scared of the
show. They don't know what to do with it, because it's smart and
it's not like anything else they've seen before.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Ted Harbert, one of the show's executive producers, who
dropped the ax on ``My So-Called Life'' when he was president of
ABC Entertainment in 1995, seemed to be experiencing doubts about
his show's prospects not long ago as he watched an episode unfold
on a sound stage here. ``I haven't seen this on TV,'' Harbert said,
sounding worried. ``I hope that doesn't kill us.''
</P>
<P>
   Mehlman's is a fretful presence on the set. He is a wraith in
gym shoes, with inverted chevrons of graying hair rising from the
sides of his head like quotation marks. But the flag he planted at
the comedy mountaintop as a writer for six seasons on ``Seinfeld''
seems to have immunized him against the bullying of network
executives. He has urged a similar calm upon Harbert.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him, `Look, you've gone from the Joint Chiefs of Staff
to the antiwar movement,''' Mehlman says. ``I think Ted's got a
case of Stockholm syndrome right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Harbert may have fallen in love with his comedy captors, but the
question is, will anybody else? In the same way that ``Seinfeld''
was a show famously about nothing, ``It's Like, You Know ... ''
seems to want to be a show that is funny without jokes. One early
episode consists entirely of the cast gathered around a television
set, watching a high-speed car chase.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never leave that room,'' Eigeman says proudly. ``We sit
there and stare at a television for 22 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Some audiences may find this alarming, of course. ``Can you bury
a joke so far that people don't even see it?'' Eigeman asks. ``We
want that moment when an audience realizes, `Oh, that was a joke.'
''
</P>
<P>
   In that way, Mehlman is not exactly risk-averse. ``Peter is very
adamant about not wanting to conform to the same formulas as other
television shows,'' says Evan Handler, who plays Shrug, an idler
living off his trust fund. ``But I don't think people are going to
look at it and go, `Wow, this totally rips up the genre.'''
</P>
<P>
   It seems far likelier that audiences will look at Handler's
character and his talkative friends and see a sort of Bizarro L.A.
version of that other sitcom. ``I've already accepted that the
comparisons are inevitable,'' Mehlman says, ``but I think they are
reflexive, rather than well thought out.''
</P>
<P>
   In its embrace of the unconventional, ``It's Like, You Know ...
'' rather insistently asserts its own intelligence. And yet Mehlman
has posed for himself the further difficulty of doing a highbrow
comedy about a city that he avers may be better known for its
other, lesser brows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I appreciate the physical beauty of Los Angeles,'' says
Mehlman, who moved here from New York a decade ago. ``It's a mass
amount of the people that I have some disdain for. I have the same
attitude about L.A. and New York as I do about men and women. I
always overestimate women and reflexively underrate men. So when a
woman in New York is not bright, it's heartbreaking. And when
somebody in Los Angeles is bright, I'm shocked. Shocked. I see L.A.
as a very corrupting place.''
</P>
<P>
   He says that as if it's like, you know, a bad thing.
</P>
<P>
   Like the sites of other city-specific series, Los Angeles was to
be an important character in the show. There would have been no way
to do that without taking into account the local preoccupation with
plastic surgery, and yet Mehlman's artistic vision did not include
an endless procession of breast-implant jokes. From that conflict
came his master stroke: he would co-opt the joke itself by
furnishing the show with the reupholstered face of Jennifer Grey.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Grey had the time of her life in the 1987 film ``Dirty
Dancing,'' her career borne aloft by the almost painfully adorable
role of Baby Houseman, a sheltered teen-ager having her first
grown-up romance in the Catskills. But when it came time to field
the offers that usually follow such a triumph, there weren't any.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought maybe people were having trouble casting somebody
who looked so specifically Jewish,'' Ms. Grey recalls. So in 1989
she decided to ``get a little something done.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Grey insisted on having a nose with some character, not the
usual Hollywood bob. ``I was really a fiend about making sure it
didn't look like a nose job,'' she says. And it didn't. But when a
small piece of cartilage shifted in her nose, the doctor who had
performed the original surgery offered to fix it. ``I didn't even
tell anybody I was doing it,'' Ms. Grey says. ``I thought it was
like having a tooth pulled. But when I came to, I didn't look like
myself again. Ever.''
</P>
<P>
   The newly pug-nosed Ms. Grey was virtually unrecognizable. ``It
was like being in the witness protection program,'' she says.
``Everywhere I went, no one knew who I was. Even ex-boyfriends I'd
run into would have this kind of spooked look on their face.''
</P>
<P>
   So when Mehlman offered her the role of Jennifer Grey, the
wacky-actress-next-door, in his new comedy, Ms. Grey was just happy
that somebody finally considered her right for the part.

BAKER SUBDUES GRIZZLIES; PAYTON EJECTED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ For the first time this season the Sonics were without
their best player when they needed him the most.
</P>
<P>
   But, boy, is it nice to have Vin Baker these days.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly working his way back into all-star form, Baker catapulted
the Sonics past the Vancouver Grizzlies 87-85 Tuesday night at
KeyArena. Baker's tip-in with .05 seconds left in the game
completed a come-from-behind effort that sent the Sonics to their
third straight victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was tremendous,'' Sonics coach Paul Westphal said.
</P>
<P>
   Baker also was in the most opportune position down the stretch.
Especially, since star point guard Gary Payton had been ejected and
missed the game's final 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Baker finished off a 31-point, seven-rebound night by getting
his left hand on Detlef Schrempf's missed layup attempt. The Sonics
(12-9) had wrangled with the Grizzlies (4-19) all night, and it was
perhaps fitting that the final play fell apart.
</P>
<P>
   When the Sonics got the ball with 15.7 seconds left and the
scored tied 85-85, it was intended that Baker score off a lob to
the basket. When Vancouver took that away, Schrempf drove the
baseline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Detlef made a great move to the basket, and how the ball came
out I don't know,'' Baker said. ``I was just fortunate to be in the
right place at the right time. I'm not really creative with my left
(hand), but it happened to fall in at the right place with the
ball.''
</P>
<P>
   When the game-winning basket fell, he acknowledged a frenzied
crowd with his right fist pointed skyward.
</P>
<P>
   It was the third straight solid outing for Baker, who shot 13 of
19 from the field. Suddenly, what was once a season-long slump is
starting to turn around. Baker matched his season-high scoring
total. He scored 31 points March 1 on the road against Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming out of my struggles, I want to be kind of cool about
it. ... I want to come out of it and act like I've scored 30
before,'' said Baker, who wore a permanent smile. ``But on a
game-winner, I couldn't control it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics were fortunate that Baker was even around down the
stretch. He played the final 10:34 with five fouls.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics trailed 83-77 late in the fourth quarter when they
rallied. They went on a 12-0 run the down the stretch that Baker
capped with a dunk to put Seattle ahead 85-83 with 36 seconds left
in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Vancouver rookie Mike Bibby came right back and tied the game
with a 10-foot jumper.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sonics got a lucky tip with .05 seconds,'' Bibby said.
``It was lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   Luck or not, the Sonics can finally boast of clutch late-game
performances. After losing five straight games, many of which
escaped the Sonics down the stretch, they have put away their last
three opponents in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   A loss the Grizzlies, now losers of 13 straight, would have set
the team back.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would have been a horrible loss,'' Sonics guard Hersey
Hawkins said. ``This would have hurt more than any loss this year.
You have to beat teams you're supposed to beat. I don't know how
many people anticipated that we would win the game. But it was
defense. We found a way to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Vancouver had dominated the paint with their front line of
Bryant Reeves (21 points) and Shareef Abdur-Rahim (21 points). But
the Sonics held the Grizzlies to just one field goal in the final
2:34.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone on the floor for the Sonics stepped up after the team
lost Payton with 3:49 left in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Vancouver's Felipe Lopez tried to deny Payton the ball on an
in-bounds play. The two got tangled when Payton threw a forearm
toward Lopez's head. Referee George Toliver immediately whistled
both players for technical fouls.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said they fouled each other while the ball wasn't in
play,'' Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   It was Payton's second technical foul. He drew his first with
1:20 left before halftime when he was admonished for jawing with
Lopez at the free throw line during a dead ball.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics trailed 61-57 when Payton departed the game after
collecting 12 points, five rebounds and three assists. He was
unavailable for interviews after the game.
</P>
<P>
   Vancouver attacked every rebound and loose ball as if it were
free money. The Grizzlies regularly went hard to the basket and
scored most of their points inside the paint. Vancouver won the
rebounding battle 50-46, which included a 22-14 edge on the
offensive glass. The Grizzlies also finished with a mere nine
turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   After the first quarter, the Sonics led just once early in the
third. They never led in the fourth until Baker's dunk in the final
minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``A sloppy win is a lot better than a well-played loss as far as
I'm concerned,'' Westphal said. ``I'm not quite sure how we ended
up winning that.''

 ROSEMARY NELSON'S FATAL PASSION FOR JUSTICE  &HT;     By FRANK VIVIANO 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Rosemary Nelson knew she was a marked woman. ``She won't
be around when your case gets to court,'' one of her clients was
warned by a police department employee last winter. ``She'll be
dead by then.''
</P>
<P>
   The professional in Nelson, the fiercely committed human rights
lawyer who defied Northern Ireland's gunmen for 16 years, refused
to be intimidated _ even after anonymous midnight telephone calls
and scribbled death threats had become as predictable as the chill
winter rains that sweep across her native County Armagh.
</P>
<P>
   But the mother and wife in her was racked with fear. ``I have to
be careful,'' she told me last May, her voice trailing off in the
midst of a detailed conversation about alleged police ties to
terrorists. ``I have a husband and three children. I have a life.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday afternoon, the 40-year-old Nelson's life ended when a car
bomb ripped her apart as she backed out of her driveway in Lurgan,
her hometown 30 miles south of Belfast. The Red Hand Defenders, a
renegade Protestant Loyalist paramilitary organization, claimed
responsibility for the assassination.
</P>
<P>
   Her 8-year-old daughter, Sarah, heard the explosion from her
desk at the Tannaghmore Primary School, less than a block away from
the family home. Sarah's two brothers, Gavin, 13, and Brian, 11,
were on a school field trip to France.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah and her parents had spent the weekend relaxing in the
countryside of County Donegal, across the border in the Irish
Republic, a rare family vacation. Nelson's car was left sitting in
the driveway.
</P>
<P>
   Holidays were rare because Robert Hamill had been kicked to
death by 15 Loyalist thugs in nearby Portadown while officers from
the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) watched from a parked police
car. Because Catholic residents of Portadown had been barricaded in
their homes several times each year, while police led Loyalist
marchers through the neighborhood singing violently anti-Catholic
battle songs. Because another human rights lawyer, Pat Finucane,
had been assassinated by masked gunmen under mysterious
circumstances in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson took on these cases and dozens more, with an intensity
that left too little time for the family she adored and that made
too many dangerous enemies.
</P>
<P>
   She was convinced that the thread tying the cases together _
``the most dangerous enemy,'' she said _ is the RUC, ``a state
security apparatus that has become a greater threat to civil
society in Northern Ireland than the paramilitaries of either
side.''
</P>
<P>
   Far from being a detached guarantor of justice, Nelson said, the
RUC was an active participant in the Loyalist campaign to keep
Ireland divided at any cost. ``It was first established as the
military wing of the Unionist parties,'' she noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, the RUC remains more than 90 percent Protestant, which
is a major reason why we have a peace agreement in Northern Ireland
but no real peace,'' she was quoted in May for a Chronicle story.
</P>
<P>
   ``There can be no genuine civil society here until we
understand, clearly and completely, the role that the security
forces have played in dividing our communities and fomenting
violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson gave testimony before the U.S. Congress in October at
hearings on the intimidation of lawyers in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Although RUC spokesmen insist that the force is nonpartisan,
recent reports by the United Nations, Human Rights Watch, the Law
Society of England and Wales and Amnesty International have all
found evidence of systematic police abuse in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Defectors from Loyalist terrorist groups have charged that RUC
officers helped them track down IRA members.
</P>
<P>
   RUC chief Ronnie Flanagan has promised an independent
investigation of these claims, and also of charges that RUC members
were responsible for death threats against Nelson. He said that
David Phillips, a police chief in Kent County, England, and FBI
investigators would work on the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``The amount of information pointing to official collusion
(between the RUC and Loyalist paramilitaries) is staggering and
cannot go unanswered,'' Julia Hall, a spokeswoman for Human Rights
Watch in New York, told the Lawyer magazine last April.
</P>
<P>
   Mountains of that information came from Rosemary Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   In newspaper jargon, Nelson was an expert source, an insider who
shared her vast knowledge of Northern Ireland's tortured society
with reporters. The Chronicle's coverage since 1992 owed a great
deal to her, on or off the record, and to an extensive network of
human rights activists _ both Catholic and Protestant _ that
radiated out from her bare-bones office on William Street near the
Lurgan railroad station.
</P>
<P>
   If she spoke on the record, which was most of the time, the
personal danger soared. ``Yes, there are threats, particularly when
I am involved in highlighting issues, when there is a lot of
attention,'' she acknowledged to Irish News reporter Steven
MacCaffery just last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But like so many people who take enormous risks in the interest
of truth, Nelson was much more than ``an informed source'' for
those who came to rely on her, much more than the stiff cardboard
robot that the term ``activist'' suggests in the terse language of
a newspaper article.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, and above all else, she was my dear friend,'' Sinn Fein
spokeswoman Dara O'Hagen said two hours after Nelson died. ``I sat
on her front steps with her a few days ago, laughing about
something, sipping a beer.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Hagen couldn't finish the conversation, and neither could I.
Rosemary Nelson affected people that way. She was the struggle
between commitment and fear, between a passion for justice and the
passions of a mother and wife, made deeply, heartbreakingly human.
</P>
<P>
   Now her three children are motherless and her husband is a
widower.
</P>
<P>
   There are events that a journalist can't reconstruct in words,
``certain things that can't be explained in human terms,'' as
Nelson herself put it the final time we spoke. Her killing is one
of those things. I can't put myself into the mind of someone who
waited patiently for a family of five to leave town, then loaded a
mother's car with explosives.
</P>
<P>
   Her clients in the Garvaghy Road Residents Coalition had heard
rumors that Nelson was targeted, and they asked the British
government to provide special surveillance and other protection for
her in December. The request was turned down without explanation.
</P>
<P>
   In the British press, which often quoted Nelson, her description
was usually pared down to ``Irish Nationalist,'' and it infuriated
her. ``That's a political label and I'm not a politician,'' she
liked to say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's justice I care about, not labels. I believe in the rule
of law, and not the gun or the bomb.''

 HOSPITALS, CLINICS ASK OSHA TO REQUIRE SAFE NEEDLE DEVICES  &HT;     By WILLIAM CARLSEN 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hundreds of the nation's medical facilities have
documented high rates of needle sticks among their workers and
report that safe needle devices dramatically reduce the number of
potentially deadly injuries.
</P>
<P>
   More than 600 reports from hospitals, clinics and other medical
facilities are under review by the U.S. Occupational Safety and
Health Administration. The reports, filed last fall, overwhelmingly
support calls for medical facilities to provide safety needles to
their workers _ and increase pressure on the workplace safety
agency to direct those facilities to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's criminal that OSHA has not acted (on these responses),
while health care workers continue to die,'' said Andy Stern,
president of the Service Employees International Union. ``Safe
technology is on the market and it is now being used successfully,
as these OSHA responses show. There's no excuse now for the
government to delay.''
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, OSHA put out a request to medical centers across
the country for feedback on the extent of needle stick injuries and
specifically asked whether safety devices were working.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next several months, reports from medical facilities of
every size and from nearly every state poured into the agency's
Washington headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   The responses reveal that needle-stick injuries are a serious
and pervasive problem, and that the use of safety needles has led
to significant declines in needles injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Implementing safety devices has been most effective at the
medical center,'' was a typical response from Karen Miller, an
infection control specialist at the 400-bed Borgess Medical Center
in Kalamazoo, Mich. ``There was an 86 percent drop in sharps
injuries (in blood collection) in one year.''
</P>
<P>
   The response was similar at Logan Hospital and Medical Center, a
50-bed facility in Guthrie, Okla. ``Needle sticks decreased from
59.5 to 15.4 per 100 occupied beds after retractable IV catheter
(needles) were introduced,'' said associate chief nursing officer
Jan Ruhl.
</P>
<P>
   Beth Israel Deaconess, a large teaching hospital in Boston,
reported similar success with safety needles, reporting `'a 60
percent reduction of reported needle stick injuries
institution-wide.''
</P>
<P>
   The Health Care Association of New York State, representing more
than 450 hospitals, nursing homes, home health care agencies and
other medical centers, told OSHA that ``safer medical devices
should be part of an overall health and safety program.''
</P>
<P>
   The agency's request for reports followed a series of Chronicle
articles last April reporting that U.S. medical workers suffer up
to 1 million accidental needle sticks each year and thousands of
nurses, doctors, lab technicians and public safety workers have
been infected with HIV, hepatitis and other lethal diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Last September, California enacted legislation that will make it
mandatory for health care facilities in the state to switch to safe
needle devices by August 1. Ten other states this year have
introduced safe needle legislation modeled on California's law,
with nine other states and the District of Columbia drafting
similar laws.
</P>
<P>
   Safe needles advocates are concerned that different state laws
could cause confusion, especially among needle manufacturers, and
they want OSHA to enforce uniform regulations nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting last week with five unions, however, OSHA officials
said the agency was not prepared to act now, noting that it was
still analyzing the more than 600 reponses it received.
</P>
<P>
   One proposal under consideration, according to the union
officials present at the meeting, is a directive by OSHA to its
field inspectors to require hospitals to evaluate safe needle
devices.
</P>
<P>
   OSHA officials have declined several requests for comments and
interviews. The agency is preparing a report on the responses it
received, which will be made public within a few weeks along with
recommendations, according to one staff person.
</P>
<P>
   The American Hospital Association recently issued a 12-step
guide for its members to help them evaluate and replace
conventional needles with safety needles, but the powerful lobbying
group is opposed to mandatory federal regulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that anyone can come up with a device and say
it is a safety needle,'' said Rick Wade, the association's senior
vice president for communication.
</P>
<P>
   He said the health care industry is being ``squeezed'' for
financial resources, and before OSHA mandates the use of safety
needles, the government and manufacturers should develop a
nationwide standard.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a wide range of different devices,'' he said. ``We
need to get everyone to agree on what constitutes an effective
safer needle.''
</P>
<P>
   But Wade said his organization has not proposed to OSHA or any
other government agency what process would be needed to set such a
standard and who would make the determination.
</P>
<P>
   In a 21-page response to OSHA's request for information, the
nation's largest needle manufacturer, Becton Dickinson, urged OSHA
to issue new enforcement rules making it clear to employers that
they have to provide their workers with safe needle devices.
</P>
<P>
   But the company argued against any single safety needle
standard, saying that it would kill off innovation and competition.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that it manufactures a wide range of safety needles,
Becton Dickinson said it ``found that many employers do not make
these new products available to their employees. Without
(enforcement action), the adoption of `safety devices' will take
much longer to achieve.''
</P>
<P>
   Included among the OSHA responses was a study by the
Departmentof Veterans Affairs that tested safety needles and
recommended that a number of them be adopted. And ECRI, a health
care research institute, submitted a report on safety needles it
completed last year that recommended a number of the devices after
thorough testing.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, health care worker unions are furious that OSHA has
not acted more than three months after the deadline for the
responses.
</P>
<P>
   ``OSHA is the first agency that should act,'' said SEIU's Stern.
``Instead the states have acted, the congress is acting, but OSHA
is delaying doing anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Wilburn, occupational health specialist for the American
Nurses Association, underscored the urgency for action.
</P>
<P>
   She said she was notified last week that two nurse members
learned recently that they had tested positive for HIV and
hepatitis C, as a result of accidental needle sticks. In both
cases, the injuries would have been prevented by safety needles,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe OSHA will come out with (an enforcement policy)
later this year,'' she said. ``Is it soon enough? Absolutely not.''

CATHOLIC ARCHDIOCESE PROTESTS EASTER STREET PARTY BY SISTERS
OF  PERPETUAL INDULGENCE
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By YUMI WILSON 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence are hoping
to take over a block of Castro Street on Easter Sunday to celebrate
their 20th anniversary _ but not if San Francisco's Roman Catholic
Archdiocese has anything to say about it.
</P>
<P>
   Maurice Healy, spokesman for the archdiocese, said allowing a
group that ``mocks the Catholic Church'' to close a public street
on the holiest day of the Christian year is just as reprehensible
as ``allowing a group of neo-Nazis to close a city street for a
celebration on the Jewish Feast of Passover.''
</P>
<P>
   Healy said Tuesday that the archdiocese wants the Board of
Supervisors to rescind a vote earlier this month shutting down
Castro Street between 17th and 18th streets on Easter, April 4, for
the party.
</P>
<P>
   In an editorial last week in the archdiocese's official
newspaper, Catholic San Francisco, Healy wrote that the
supervisors' vote showed ``extraordinary insensitivity to people of
all faiths. ... This group has garnered a reputation for outrageous
behavior by mocking religious life, ridicule of Catholic
institutions and profane references to sacred liturgies.''
</P>
<P>
   Sister MaryMaye Himm said Tuesday that the group had no
intention of calling off the celebration.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really appalled at the insensitivity of comparing us to
neo-Nazis, which totally invalidates the Jewish struggle against
Nazis,'' Himm said. ``The comparison is offensive not only to
myself but to Jewish people everywhere, and the Catholic Church
should be ashamed for promoting such an absurdity.''
</P>
<P>
   He said of the party, ``There are no pagan rituals. We're having
a stage show, dancing to bands and rereleasing a safe-sex pamphlet
that came out in 1981. The goal is education and celebration.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence is a flamboyant theater
troupe of 30 gay, lesbian, transgender and straight members who
dress like nuns. The group came together 20 years ago to
``promulgate universal joy and expiate stigmatic guilt,'' Himm
said.
</P>
<P>
   The group had asked the Department of Parking and Traffic for
permission to close a block of Castro Street on Easter Sunday _ the
day ``we were formed,'' said Himm. The department refused, saying
some merchants had raised parking and traffic concerns, he said.
</P>
<P>
   That is when Board of Supervisors President Tom Ammiano and
Supervisor Mark Leno, both of whom are openly gay, drafted a
resolution to overturn the denial.
</P>
<P>
   Supervisors unanimously approved the resolution March 1, saying
the group had done a number of good things for the poor, homeless,
sick and youths.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is, the group is a volunteer organization, which has
the mission of doing good deeds truly, though obviously with some
humor, in the spirit of those in the religious order,'' Leno said.
</P>
<P>
   Healy applauds the group for its fund-raising programs but says
that to close a public street on Easter Sunday for a group that
``mocked the pope during his 1987 visit with a theatrical exorcism
in Union Square'' is not acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Archbishop William Levada was out of town Tuesday, but Healy
said Levada supports his position and would like to see supervisors
rescind their vote.
</P>
<P>
   Leno, however, made it clear that he stands by his vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we all have to lighten up a little bit,'' he said.
``And it's not to say that everyone is going to feel good about the
sisters. But I can feel comfortable about my vote, because they do
good work and offer no disrespect.''

 &HT;    IOC backs Samaranch: Amid vote-buying scandal, Olympics chief
gets an overwhelming vote of confidence
 &HT;    By Bert Roughton Jr.
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lausanne, Switzerland _ Meeting in a historic emergency session
to confront the Salt Lake City bidding crisis, the International
Olympic Committee today gave its longtime president, Juan Antonio
Samaranch, a resounding vote of confidence.
</P>
<P>
   In a secret ballot taken behind closed doors, the IOC endorsed
Samaranch by an overwhelming margin of 86-2.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch has come under severe attack from critics outside the
IOC in the wake of the vote-buying scandal stemming from Salt Lake
City's successful bid for the 2002 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   While critics have called for Samaranch to resign, the
78-year-old Spaniard has insisted he intends to serve out the rest
of his term until 2001 if IOC members continue to support him.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech to the members gathered here, Samaranch accepted
responsibility for the scandal and urged the IOC to expel six
members whose behavior has been found unethical by an internal
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   He told the members that the damage done by the Salt Lake
scandal had seriously harmed public opinion of the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a virtual firestorm that has consumed the world
media,'' he said. ``Bidding cities which may have acted improperly
are a matter of the past: It is the IOC which now is on trial.''
</P>
<P>
   After expressing their support for Samaranch, the IOC began
hearing statements from the members recommended for expulsion by
the IOC executive board. The expulsions were expected to be
approved by similarly large margins. It would be the first time in
105 years the IOC has forced any of its members to give up their
positions.
</P>
<P>
   The members recommended for expulsion are Siuli Paul Wallwork,
Western Samoa; Agustin Arroyo, Ecuador; Jean-Claude Ganga, Republic
of Congo; Zein El Abdin Ahmed Abdel Gadir, Sudan; Lamine Keita,
Mali; and Sergio Santander, Chile.
</P>
<P>
   Most have said they did nothing wrong and some have challenged
the legitimacy of the investigations that have condemned them.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC is eager to get the scandal behind it to forestall
external campaigns for reform, particularly in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Anita DeFrantz, the senior U.S. IOC member, received
a letter from Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) reminding her that
Congress may act if the IOC does not take strong enough measures
during this week's emergency session.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the strongest terms, let me communicate to you my hope that
the IOC will move quickly to adopt reforms necessary to provide
transparency and accountability to the IOC organization and
processes,'' he wrote. ``Without such independent action, the
demand from Congress to act will be irrepressible.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain noted that the IOC enjoys special tax status that allows
it to pay no taxes and permits corporate sponsors to write off the
cost of their sponsorships. McCain has said before that these
advantages could be removed if the IOC doesn't clean up its act.
</P>
<P>
   IOC officials hope the gravity of expelling its members, coupled
with clear indications that it enact important reforms, will be
enough to forestall an assault in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Francois Carrard, the IOC director general, acknowledged that
the IOC is paying close attention to events in Washington. ``We
have been following and reading the recommendations which we got
from various sources,'' he said. ``We believe that the action which
is being undertaken now should be of the nature to satisfy those
who are considering certain measures.''

 &HT;    IOC backs Samaranch: Amid vote-buying scandal, Olympics chief
gets an overwhelming vote of confidence
 &HT;    By Bert Roughton Jr.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Lausanne, Switzerland _ Meeting in a historic emergency session
to confront the Salt Lake City bidding crisis, the International
Olympic Committee today gave its longtime president, Juan Antonio
Samaranch, a resounding vote of confidence.
</P>
<P>
   In a secret ballot taken behind closed doors, the IOC endorsed
Samaranch by an overwhelming margin of 86-2.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch has come under severe attack from critics outside the
IOC in the wake of the vote-buying scandal stemming from Salt Lake
City's successful bid for the 2002 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   While critics have called for Samaranch to resign, the
78-year-old Spaniard has insisted he intends to serve out the rest
of his term until 2001 if IOC members continue to support him.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech to the members gathered here, Samaranch accepted
responsibility for the scandal and urged the IOC to expel six
members whose behavior has been found unethical by an internal
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   He told the members that the damage done by the Salt Lake
scandal had seriously harmed public opinion of the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a virtual firestorm that has consumed the world
media,'' he said. ``Bidding cities which may have acted improperly
are a matter of the past: It is the IOC which now is on trial.''
</P>
<P>
   After expressing their support for Samaranch, the IOC began
hearing statements from the members recommended for expulsion by
the IOC executive board. The expulsions were expected to be
approved by similarly large margins. It would be the first time in
105 years the IOC has forced any of its members to give up their
positions.
</P>
<P>
   The members recommended for expulsion are Siuli Paul Wallwork,
Western Samoa; Agustin Arroyo, Ecuador; Jean-Claude Ganga, Republic
of Congo; Zein El Abdin Ahmed Abdel Gadir, Sudan; Lamine Keita,
Mali; and Sergio Santander, Chile.
</P>
<P>
   Most have said they did nothing wrong and some have challenged
the legitimacy of the investigations that have condemned them.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC is eager to get the scandal behind it to forestall
external campaigns for reform, particularly in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Anita DeFrantz, the senior U.S. IOC member, received
a letter from Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) reminding her that
Congress may act if the IOC does not take strong enough measures
during this week's emergency session.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the strongest terms, let me communicate to you my hope that
the IOC will move quickly to adopt reforms necessary to provide
transparency and accountability to the IOC organization and
processes,'' he wrote. ``Without such independent action, the
demand from Congress to act will be irrepressible.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain noted that the IOC enjoys special tax status that allows
it to pay no taxes and permits corporate sponsors to write off the
cost of their sponsorships. McCain has said before that these
advantages could be removed if the IOC doesn't clean up its act.
</P>
<P>
   IOC officials hope the gravity of expelling its members, coupled
with clear indications that it enact important reforms, will be
enough to forestall an assault in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Francois Carrard, the IOC director general, acknowledged that
the IOC is paying close attention to events in Washington. ``We
have been following and reading the recommendations which we got
from various sources,'' he said. ``We believe that the action which
is being undertaken now should be of the nature to satisfy those
who are considering certain measures.''

<P>
   1. WHAT YOU WON'T SEE AT THIS YEAR'S OSCARS At this year's 71st
Academy Awards Ceremony on March 21, the usual parade of
overdressed actresses and over-choreographed dance numbers is
expected. But there's plenty we won't see : Oscar taboos and
precautions that go on behind the scenes. After more than 25 years
covering the big night, Ivor Davis lists 10 things you can bet you
won't see when you tune in this year. 900 words. (N/A Great Britain
and Australia.)

ACADEMY AWARDS QUIZ : OSCAR GOES TO WORK What does it take to win
an Oscar? Test your knowledge with this quiz. By S. Burelison.
1,300 words + photos.
_______________________________________________________________ 3.
STEVE MARTIN: STILL WILD BUT NOT AS CRAZY There was a time when
comic actor Steve Martin made a movie or two every year. These days
he's becoming more and more active offscreen, particularly as a
writer. A turning point was ``Picasso at the Lapin Agile,'' (1995,)
the highly acclaimed stage play that explored the creative and
scientific processes. ``In a weird way I think the writing has
helped my acting,'' he says. Interview by Ian Spelling. 1,300 words
+ photo. 4. STANLEY KUBRICK : THE MAN WHO INVENTED THE FUTURE When
Stanley Kubrick died on March 7 at age 70, he left behind a
dazzling body of work - and a legacy of almost total silence. In
four decades as a filmmaker, Kubrick virtually never agreed to be
interviewed. In 1968 however, shortly after the release of his
seminal science-fiction film ``2001 : A Space Odyssey,'' the
director was interviewed by Playboy magazine and talked about
``2001'' and ``Dr. Strangelove'' (1964,) his visions of the future
and his philosophy of filmmaking. Excerpts from this interview are
available in a long and short version of 4,200 words or 1,500 words
+ photos. By Eric Norden. From 1968 Playboy magazine. (PLEASE CHECK

brave new world of digital television, which allows dozens of
channels to be received via existing TV aerials, has a major flaw :
there are too many homes that it cannot reach. But now the physics
of electromagnetic waves is being exploited to make digital TV
available to almost as many people as can recive analogue TV
signals. By Barry Fox. From New Scientist magazine. 500 words. (N/A
Brazil, Australia, New Zealand.) 6. SCOT FREE : ROBERT CARLYLE HAS
GONE HOLLYWOOD,
</P>
<P>
   AND HE'S HAVING A BALL Scottish actor Robert Carlyle plays the
villain in the latest James Bond film ``The World Is Not Enough.''
The international success of ``The Full Monty'' made Carlyle a
movie star, a development which he never expected. ``Filming that
strip scene was the most terrifying thing in my whole life,'' he
says. Interview by Cindy Pearlman. 1,300 words + photo.

ATTRACTION : BEN AFFLECK TRIES HIS HAND AT ROMANTIC COMEDY He isn't
even 27 yet but Ben Affleck has already won an Academy Award,

with one of Hollywood's hottest actresses. Interview by Jeanne Wolf

BEHIND-THE-SCENES LOOK AT
</P>

 &HT;    Gov. Bush's staff can't recall talk of Stroh closing
 &HT;    By Jo Lee Ferguson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONGVIEW, Texas _ Union officials representing Longview Stroh
Brewery employees said they think they had a productive meeting
last week in Austin when they talked to Gov. George W. Bush and his
staff members about the troubled brewery.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is, Bush's staff doesn't recall talking with the
union representatives about the brewery, which could close unless
another company buys the plant.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Gardner, secretary-treasurer and business manager of the
Teamsters union Local 745 in Dallas, said he and other Teamsters
officials met Wednesday with Bush and some of his staff members. He
said they presented the governor with a petition asking for his
help in keeping the brewery open.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Stroh Brewery Co. announced it was selling its
brands and assets to Miller Brewing Co. and Pabst Brewing Co., but
Longview Stroh Brewery was not included in the sale. Stroh said the
plant could close nine months after the sale is finalized in April
if a buyer isn't found.
</P>
<P>
   If the brewery closes, it will mean the loss of more than 300
jobs and significant revenue losses for local government and
schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was pretty anxious to get something done for the economy
down there and everything,'' Gardner said. ``That's the first time
I've met with him, and he's a pretty genuine person.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Gardner, Bush said he was going to work on the
Stroh Brewery issue and contact Longview's economic development
corporation. He said the governor seemed to be ``pretty impressed''
with the petition the Teamsters presented him, and their meeting
lasted about 50 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was real productive,'' Gardner said, although he
added that he could not talk about some of the issues that were
discussed during the meeting. ``He's going to do everything he can
do within his power to facilitate a purchase (of the plant) ...''
</P>
<P>
   However, Scott McClellan, a spokesman for the governor's office,
said the staff member who attended the meeting was not aware of any
discussion about the Longview Stroh Brewery. Bush was out of town,
so McClellan could not ask him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very informal meeting,'' McClellan said.
</P>
<P>
   T.P. O'Mahoney, Texas Workforce Commissioner representing labor,
said he, too, didn't hear any discussion about the Longview Stroh
Brewery or Longview, for that matter.
</P>
<P>
   The Local 745 union representatives are newly elected, he said,
and the meeting ``was just a courtesy call just to come down and
chat about areas of concern.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor has had similar meetings with other union
representatives, O'Mahoney said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it would have been appropriate anyway (to talk
about the Stroh Brewery),'' he said. ``This wasn't a business
meeting. It was just a courtesy call.''

 &HT;    They huffed and they buffed
 &HT;    By John Kelso
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ University of Texas custodian Eric Meuth lifted
his arms over his head like he'd just wrestled a bull to the ground
at the rodeo.
</P>
<P>
   And no wonder. Meuth had just run a floor buffer through the
twisting buffer driving course without knocking over any peanuts
Tuesday at The Custodial Tournament of Champions VII.
</P>
<P>
   Teams of residence hall custodians from UT, Texas A&AMP;M, Texas
Tech and Southwest Texas State competed at UT's Jester Center in
six janitorial games _ peanut herding, the toilet tissue toss, the
soaked sponge relay, the trash can relay, window wipeout and the
buffer race.
</P>
<P>
   This year Southwest Texas State dusted the competition to win
the traveling trophy for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   The key to success in buffer driving is to make it through the
zigzag course without hitting the Styrofoam cups filled with
unshelled peanuts that line the course.
</P>
<P>
   When buffing a floor, keeping a tight grip on the handle is
important, Meuth said. `` 'Cause if you don't, it can hit a dry
spot and really hurt you,'' said Meuth, 29, who was running the
buffing course for the Texas Diamond Devils, one of two janitorial
teams representing UT.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the events test janitorial skills. Then there's the
soaked sponge relay where team members _ there are five per team _
pass a sponge to each other over their shoulders, with one of them
squeezing the water into a bucket. The team collecting the most
water wins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just like to get wet,'' said A&AMP;M custodian Gloria Ealoms,
explaining why she enjoys the sponge event.
</P>
<P>
   While the custodians take winning seriously, they have a good
time. Teams dress in team T-shirts. Custodians lead each other in
cheers. ``We got spirit, yes we do. We got spirit. How 'bout you?''
They shake cowbells and wave pompoms.
</P>
<P>
   They also practice their events. ``This is the Olympics _ for
us,'' said Donneal Dembo, 43, a UT custodian and member of the
Texas Vipers, one of the two UT teams.
</P>
<P>
   On your mark. Get set. Sweep. It was that kind of a day. As A&AMP;M
custodian Sabrina Edwards swept peanuts down the course with a
24-inch dust mop in the peanut-herding competition, her Aggie
teammates on the sidelines cheered her on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's go, Brina, let's go. Let's go Brina, let's go.'' they
chanted. Then, when a UT broom handler began sweeping, those same
Aggies chanted, ``Lose them peanuts, lose them peanuts.''
</P>
<P>
   Peanut herding is a time event done by teams of two. It starts
with Custodian No. 1 pushing 25 peanuts with a dust mop around the
27-inch-wide course. After Custodian No. 1 tags Custodian No. 2,
Custodian No. 2 pushes the peanuts back around the course, along
with 25 additional peanuts that had been sitting on the ground in
front of him.
</P>
<P>
   If a peanut escapes out of bounds, five seconds are added to
your time.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the window wipeout, featuring teams of two
custodians scraping and washing lipstick, shaving cream, toothpaste
and other gunk off windows.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, judges check closely for stains.
</P>
<P>
   This year's event suffered one minor scandal. The trash can
relay had to be rerun after several appeals were lodged. Seems one
of the trash bags being used by the Tech team blew away, and the
A&AMP;M team picked it up and used it.
</P>
<P>
   The Southwest Texas State team designed the trash cans with
toilet seats on top for the toilet tissue toss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dennis Rodman doesn't have anything on us,'' said Isabel
Aldape Jr., custodial services manager at Southwest Texas State.
</P>
<P>
   The tissue toss, another event with teams of two, starts when
the custodians load a cardboard box of toilet paper onto a dolly.
The dolly is rolled to a table where one of the custodians cuts
open the box with a box cutter.
</P>
<P>
   This custodian hands rolls of toilet paper one at a time to the
other custodian, who tries to toss the rolls of TP into the toilet
seat hole 20 feet away.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest Texas State and UT's Diamond Devils tied for first in
the tissue toss with seven buckets each. So I guess you could say
they wiped up.

 &HT;    True stories from one who knows
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Junior high school kids are the toughest
audience. The very toughest.
</P>
<P>
   Either from instinct or experience, Patrick Reynolds knows this.
The grandson of R.J. Reynolds has testified against the tobacco
industry before Congress. That's an easy audience compared with
what he faced recently at Dayton's Kettering Middle School: 400
sixth-graders, squirming in an auditorium, ready for him.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds told them he was going to start out by telling his own
story.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of a sad story. As a boy of 3, my parents divorced,
and I didn't see my father again until I was 9 years old. And I
really needed him and missed him. I didn't have him to pat me on
the back and say, 'You did a good job, son.' ``
</P>
<P>
   A kid in the audience said, `` Awwww . . .'' with the scorn only
a sixth-grader could muster.
</P>
<P>
   If Reynolds heard the comment (and he did), he didn't let on.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of you share some of this loss,'' he continued. ``How
many of you are living in homes with only one parent?''
</P>
<P>
   A third of the hands went up.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds finally wrote a letter to his father _ ``Dad, where are
you?'' _ and his father sent for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The anticipation was huge,'' he said. ``I walked into this
room and there was my dad, lying on his back dying of emphysema
caused by smoking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dad, what's wrong?'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have asthma,'' his father said lying to his son.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds saw his father five more times before he died at age
58.
</P>
<P>
   It was hard to tell when Reynolds hooked the kids. Maybe it was
the adolescent humor. (He got a big reaction when he put up a slide
of ``Joe Chemo,'' depicting the famous cigarette icon camel in a
hospital bed.) Maybe it was the shock tactics: before-and-after
photos of a high school track star who chewed tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   ``They cut his tongue out,'' he said, ``and he could never talk
again.''
</P>
<P>
   A half hour into his presentation _ a time span that normally
would have tested all bounds of sixth-grade endurance _ the kids
sat spellbound for an entire 10 seconds while Reynolds paused for
dramatic effect .
</P>
<P>
   ``He had them,'' said Kettering Middle School principal Rusty
Clifford.
</P>

   The theatrics come naturally to Reynolds, 50, who also spoke at
Valley View and Wayne high schools and the Samaritan North Center
during his two-day trip to the Miami Valley. He had a career in
Hollywood for many years. He starredin a 1986 film, The
Eliminators, playing a robot named Mandroid who delivered such
lines as ``You're the one who needs body work.'' His jet-set
lifestyle included a relationship with actress Shelley Duvall, and
acquaintances with the likes of Jack Nicholson, Arnold
Schwarzenegger and Dodi al Fayed. But, he said, ``The jet-set life
didn't give me what I was looking for _ my father.''
</P>
<P>
   A former smoker, Reynolds doesn't want to emulate his father,
either in his untimely death or his role as the ``profligate heir
with the 200-foot yacht and homes all over the world.''
</P>
<P>
   One of seven children from his father's four marriages, Reynolds
inherited $2 million from his father, who left most of his estate
to charity. Reynolds pumped half of his fortune into his Foundation
for a Smoke Free America. In addition to numerous speaking
engagements, he lobbies lawmakers to increase the cigarette tax and
to make it harder for juveniles to buy cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   No member of the Reynolds family has held a position of power at
R.J. Reynolds for 50 years, he said, yet the name holds a symbolic
weight: ``My name gives me the ability to focus attention on
tobacco use _ and that may be the greatest inheritance of all.''
</P>
<P>
   What makes a man turn against a business that left him a
comfortable fortune?

 &HT;    Jeff Gordon's faith shows science, religion can mix into
powerful fuel
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ It's my theory that stock car racing caused the
latest intellectual fad on college campuses.
</P>
<P>
   Success in stock car racing would appear to be grounded in
science through the relentless pursuit of the limits of chemistry,
physics, aerodynamics, structural engineering and such.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the first thing the winning driver does after he
crawls out the window of his colorful No. 24 Chevrolet is to thank
God.
</P>
<P>
   Science takes a back seat to the supernatural when credit for
NASCAR Winston Cup victories is handed out, at least by NASCAR
champion Jeff Gordon, who seems to win most of the races.
</P>
<P>
   This habit of giving thanks to God for winning another pile of
money doesn't sit too well with the other two dozen or so drivers
who, by implication, were not as deserving of God's divine
intervention as was Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon's crew chief, Ray Evernham, also is quick to give credit
to God for all the victories, which aggravates all the other pit
crews to no end.
</P>
<P>
   God-fearing can be the only explanation for why no one ever
blames God for causing 30 other drivers to lose, but that's par for
the course whether the person being interviewed is the winner of a
sporting event or the lone survivor of a plane crash.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon and Evernham may be thanking God for giving them a better
understanding of science than their less blessed opponents.
</P>
<P>
   They also may be thanking their Supreme Being for giving them
better depth perception, quicker reflexes, superior coordination,
more stamina, better looks and more overall natural (God-given)
talent than other NASCAR crews.
</P>
<P>
   Still, nothing makes people madder than being patronized by
holier-than-thou sermonizers.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I like Gordon. If God likes Gordon, who am I to
argue?
</P>
<P>
   Outside of NASCAR circles, Gordon has lots of fans. And Gordon
is unquestionably responsible for much of the explosion of
popularity of stock car racing, which is why I theorize that Gordon
and stock car racing are behind the newest intellectual pursuit of
the relationship between science and religion on college campuses.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, I would think that putting science and religion
together in the same course of study would be the equivalent of
simultaneously whistling and drinking water. It would be
interesting entertainment but would serve of no real purpose.
</P>
<P>
   There is fact-based science and faith-based religion. One is a
study of the natural and the other is a musing of the supernatural.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean that scientists don't have faith-based
religious beliefs or that priests can't be preeminent scientists.
</P>
<P>
   That also doesn't mean that scientists can't make ethical
decisions such as those that involve cloning and genetic
engineering just as it doesn't mean that preachers can't be
disciplined logicians.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the considerable overlap, it seems to me that at the
extremes the two disciplines have irreconcilable differences
regarding how they arrive at their conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this is part of the intellectual appeal at U.S.
universities where decidedly non-NASCAR types are pursuing Jeff
Gordon's science-religion conundrum.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota academician Ian G. Barbour recently received a $1.2
million Templeton Prize for Progress in Religion for his work in
pioneering the interdisciplinary study of science and religion.
Barbour promptly gave gave $1 million of his prize award to the
Berkeley, Calif., Center for Graduate Theological Union that has
been in the forefront of bringing together religion and science.
</P>
<P>
   It was not reported whether Barbour gave thanks to God for
coming in first in the run for the Templeton Prize for Progress in
Religion. But if he did, he would be in good company.

   Q: My children and I were planning a camping vacation to
Yosemite National Park in July, but I'm concerned after hearing
about three women being abducted there. Is Yosemite advising
visitors to do anything?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. As previously reported, the three women were last seen
Feb. 15 near a restaurant and motel outside the park. Yosemite
officials say everything is operating normally inside the park, and
no special advisories have been extended. ``All we can do is tell
visitors to take the normal precautions that any traveler anywhere
would take,'' said park spokeswoman Kathy Farrier.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI, however, continues to ask anyone with information
concerning the women's whereabouts to call 1-800-435-7883.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did the American Airlines pilots union actually pay the
multimillion-dollar contempt-of-court fine levied against it last
month?
</P>
<P>
   A: The union hasn't been fined yet. On Feb. 10, U.S. District
Judge Joe Kendall found the Allied Pilots Association members in
contempt of court for ignoring his order to return to work, and
said he intended to assess fines and damages. The union gave the
court a $10 million deposit toward those fines and damages. On Feb.
17, Kendall extended to May 12 his temporary restraining order. He
also delayed his decision on how to punish the union for originally
ignoring his order to return to work and continued the damages
hearing until April 12.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How is the Dow Jones Industrial Average calculated?
</P>
<P>
   A: Myron Greene, publisher of the Mutual Fund Timing Guide,
explains that in 1896, when Dow Jones &AMP; Co. began computing its
industrial average, it was a simple average of the prices of 12 of
the leading stocks of the day. Such an average is easy to
calculate, but a problem arises when one of the component companies
splits its stock. Suppose the average consists of only two stocks,
each priced at $30 a share. Obviously, the average price is $30.
Now suppose that one of the stocks is split two for one. Each
shareholder ends up with two shares for each one previously held,
but each share is worth only $15, so nothing has really changed for
the shareholder. The split will affect the average, however,
because the new value will be the average of $30 and $15, or
$22.50. It will appear, incorrectly, that the average has suffered
a 25 percent decline.
</P>
<P>
   The method used by Dow Jones to correct this problem is to
change the divisor used to compute the average. In this example,
the sum of $30 and $15 is divided by 1.5 rather than 2, giving the
same value for the average ($30) as before the split. The divisor
also is adjusted when the number of stocks in the average changes
or when a stock in the average is replaced. Because of numerous
adjustments over the past 100 years, the value of the divisor today
is 0.2252. To compute the average, the prices of the 30 stocks in
the average are added together and divided by 0.2252.
</P>
<P>
   Q: During World War II, I spent some time on Corregidor in the
Philippines. What is it like there now?
</P>
<P>
   A: The rocky, fortified island at the entrance to Manila Bay is
one of the only battlefields of World War II readily available to
the history-minded visitor to Asia. Its charms are one of the
better-kept secrets of the region.
</P>
<P>
   The island, sometimes called the Gibraltar of the Pacific, has a
population of about 230. Ruins of the military installation and
ordnance can be inspected by visitors, most of whom come by boat on
day trips from Manila. Those who pay a small surcharge can see a
light and sound show in the shaft of the Malinta Tunnel, which
served as Gen. Douglas MacArthur's headquarters from December 1941
to March 1942. The island has a war museum and memorial, and there
are elaborate plans for restoration. Lodging is available at the
Corregidor Inn.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the real last name of England's royal family?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's Windsor or Mountbatten-Windsor. The dynastic name of
Saxe-Coburg-Gotha (German: Sachsen-Coburg und Gotha) was that of
the German-born husband of Queen Victoria, who died in 1901. Her
husband was Albert, prince consort of Great Britain and Ireland.
Their eldest son was Edward VII. During the anti-German atmosphere
of World War I, George V declared by royal proclamation, on July
17, 1917, that all descendants of Queen Victoria in the male line
who also were British subjects would adopt the surname of Windsor.
</P>
<P>
   Queen Elizabeth II's children normally would have borne their
father's surname, Mountbatten (which itself had been anglicized
from Batternberg). In 1952, however, soon after her accession,
Queen Elizabeth II declared in council that her children and
descendants would bear the surname Windsor. On Feb. 8, 1960, this
decision was modified to the effect that offspring other than those
styled prince or princess and royal highness should bear the name
Mountbatten-Windsor.
</P>
<P>
   Q: After reading about the Los Angeles faults and watching
``Volcano'' and ``Meteor,'' I wonder: Are there any geologically
stable areas in the United States?
</P>
<P>
   A: Some areas are at less risk than others for such natural
hazards as earthquakes, but obviously there are no absolutes. And
someone fearing earthquakes might move from the Far West to the
Midwest only to face varying risks of tornadoes, or to the South or
East to fret about hurricanes. Meteor strikes are impossible to
predict.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Geological Survey maps of the United States depict several
states as free of designated earthquake regions: Florida,
Mississippi, North Dakota, Minnesota and Michigan. These are mostly
earthquake-free: South Carolina, Oregon, Texas, South Dakota,
Nebraska, Indiana, Kentucky, West Virginia and Pennsylvania. The
Geological Survey maps show these states as being free of hurricane
or tornado regions: Washington, Oregon, California, Nevada, Idaho,
Utah, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota, West Virginia, Vermont,
New Hampshire and Maine. Naturally there could be, and have been,
exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   If you're thinking of moving, check the book ``Places Rated
Almanac,'' which has maps and text on climate, natural hazards and
weather extremes.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I greatly admire Oprah Winfrey. What is her educational
background?
</P>
<P>
   A: After graduating from high school in Nashville, she attended
Tennessee State University in Nashville, majoring in the English
language arts. She had won an Elks Club oratorical contest when she
was 16 that guaranteed her a full scholarship to Tennessee State.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I saw an item about an herbal substitute for Viagra,
apparently being produced in China. Can it be purchased in the
United States?
</P>
<P>
   A: Not yet, but herbalists in New York already are predicting
strong sales when the product, called Weige (Big Brother),
eventually makes it to these shores. More than 40 agents across
China have gained permission to sell it, according to a report in
China Daily, and nearly 100 foreign traders have asked for samples
and hope to become agents outside China.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese company behind Weige says it's safer, healthier and
cheaper than Viagra. Its packaging is designed to look foreign,
featuring a photograph of an Adonis statue, flying doves and
cavorting women in bikinis. Jiang Wei, chairman of Shenyang
Feilong, the drug company, predicts big sales in China: ``We are
going to sell 100 million pills this year. Our Weige works better
than Viagra, and it is all herbal, so it does not have any side
effects.'' In China, a packet of eight Weige pills sells for $11.
Weige hasn't undergone independent clinical trials, but Jiang said
tests had been performed on volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What was Ronald Reagan's first film?
</P>
<P>
   A: It was ``Love Is On the Air'' (1937). Reagan played a
small-town radio announcer, Andy McLeod, who told too much in his
news broadcasts about corrupt local politicians and was demoted to
children's programs. But McLeod persevered, exposed the crooks, and
won the girl, portrayed by June Travis.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you explain the origin and meaning of the ``Esq.''
designation that some men use after their name? Are there certain
requirements for using it?
</P>
<P>
   A: Esquire is the slightly older version of squire, as taken
into English at the time of the Norman conquest from the French
esquier, meaning ``shield bearer.'' The earliest squires, or
esquires, were candidates for knighthood. After the flowering of
knighthood had passed, the words Squire and Esquire (now with
capital letters) were used to designate men slightly above the rank
of tradespeople. Since they often were looked to as leaders, they
often served as magistrates in local courts, and the term Squire
came to be used more and more as a form of address for judges and
other local dignitaries.
</P>
<P>
   Today it's rarely seen, at least in the United States, except as
a courtesy title for some attorneys. There aren't any requirements
about the use of Esq., but since it's basically limited to the
legal profession, anyone else tacking it onto his (or her) name
might be accused of trying to pass himself off as a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the name of the agency Jane Fonda founded to fight
teen pregnancy, and how may I contact it?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's the Georgia Campaign for Adolescent Pregnancy
Prevention. Write to G-CAPP, One CNN Center, Suite 610, North
Tower, Atlanta, GA 30303; or call 404-524-2277.
</P>
<P>
   Q: During his moviemaking days, actor Charlton Heston, president
of the National Rifle Association, played everything from Moses to
Admiral Nimitz. Did he ever serve in the military? What about Rep.
Bob Barr (R-Ga.), who is on the NRA's board?
</P>
<P>
   A: After graduating from high school in 1941, Heston enrolled at
Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., on a drama scholarship.
After completing two years, he left college to enlist in the Army
Air Corps. He spent most of his three-year tour of duty stationed
in the Aleutian Islands, where he was a radio-gunner on bombers. As
reported previously, Barr was never in the armed services.
</P>
<P>
   Q: At the recently concluded Clinton impeachment trial, Chief
Justice William Rehnquist stated two words, possibly in Latin, when
he sounded the gavel to indicate the end of the trial. What were
those words?
</P>
<P>
   A: Rehnquist uttered the expression sine die, which means
``without day'' or ``without assigning a day for a further meeting
or hearing.'' It's traditionally spoken when a legislative body
adjourns without appointing a day on which to assemble again.
</P>
<P>
   Q: An article about a forecast for drought and fires this summer
mentioned something called the Palmer Drought Severity Index. I've
never heard of that. Who was Palmer? How is the index calculated?
</P>
<P>
   A: The PDSI was developed in the early- to mid-'60s, and was
first published in 1965 by Wayne C. Palmer, a meteorologist with
the U.S. Weather Bureau's Office of Climatology. It depicts
prolonged _ meaning months and years _ abnormal dryness or wetness
and reflects the general long-term status of water supplies in
aquifers, reservoirs and streams. It compares the actual amount of
precipitation received in an area during a specified time period
with the normal or average amount expected over that same period.
The index is calculated based on precipitation and temperature
data, as well as the local available water content of the soil.
Human impacts on the water balance, such as irrigation, aren't
considered.
</P>
<P>
   While the PDSI has been used for years, and is ``ingrained
within a lot of legislation and a lot of agencies within the
government,'' a newer index has been developed to provide drought
data more quickly, said Mark Svoboda, a climatologist with the
National Drought Mitigation Center at the University of
Nebraska-Lincoln. The SPI, based only on precipitation, provides
data within six to eight weeks, Svoboda said, which sometimes can
be handier than the more complex PDSI formulation.
</P>
<P>
   Details are available online at http:enso.unl.edu/ndmc, under
the drought watch section.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In connection with Joe DiMaggio's death, I noticed that all
three brothers who played Major League baseball had the same middle
name: Paul. Was their father named Paul?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. Joe was the eighth of nine children and the fourth of
five sons of Joseph Paul and Rosalia DiMaggio. His two ballplaying
brothers were Dom and Vince. Their parents had come from Isola
della Femmine, off the coast of Sicily, where the father's name was
spelled Giuseppe Paolo DiMaggio.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: How can fans send a note of encouragement to Joe Torre, who
has been diagnosed with prostate cancer?
</P>
<P>
   A: Write to the Yankees manager in care of his team: New York
Yankees, Yankee Stadium, Bronx, NY 10451.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How old is Elizabeth Dole? Absolutely no one has mentioned
it, either on television or in the newspaper. Her husband is in his
late 70s. She has got to be too old to run for president.
</P>
<P>
   A: Her age is no secret and has been included often in
Journal-Constitution articles, such as one published Jan. 15 when
she stepped down as president of the American Red Cross. But for
the record, here it is again: She's 62. She will be 63 on July 29.
Bob Dole will be 76 on July 22.
</P>
<P>
   You may be a ``what if'' kind of person, wondering what if she
decides officially to run as the Republican candidate for
president, and what if she wins the nomination, and what if she
wins the election and takes office Jan. 20, 2001. If all that were
to happen, she would be 64 on that date. The oldest president
inaugurated the first time was Ronald Reagan, who was 69 years and
349 days old when taking office on Jan. 20, 1981.

<P>
   Q: What are the codes stamped on the bottom of canned goods? It
is done in a way to keep consumers from knowing the expiration
date?
</P>
<P>
   A: Codes on canned goods aren't a way to conceal expiration
dates; they provide manufacturers with information they need to
ensure product safety. Using the code, the manufacturers can
identify the plant where the product was processed, the processing
line it was run on, and when and where the product originated.
</P>
<P>
   Commercially canned goods are safe to eat even after long
periods of storage unless the cans are bulging, leaking or badly
rusted. Perhaps you could write dates on cans to help with your
``first in, first out'' system of rotating stocks. For the best
quality _ flavor, texture and color _ canned goods should be used
within a year of purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Last December, a Royal Caribbean cruise ship was involved in
an accident off St. Maarten that caused serious damage. I never
heard an explanation of the accident, or whose fault it was. Do you
have any information?
</P>
<P>
   A: The accident occurred the night of Dec. 14-15 when the
Monarch of the Seas struck Proselyte Reef less than a mile outside
the entrance to Philipsburg harbor, opening a 3-by-60-foot gash in
the hull. The vessel, which had sailed from San Juan, Puerto Rico,
had made an unscheduled stop at St. Maarten to evacuate a passenger
who had an apparent heart attack. As it was leaving, in darkness,
the ship struck the shoal and began taking on water, so the crew
decided to run it aground on soft sand. Reports indicated three of
the Monarch 's 18 watertight compartments had filled with water.
</P>
<P>
   Royal Caribbean officials couldn't immediately explain the cause
of the accident, because the reef is identified on all navigational
charts and has a floating buoy with a light that flashes every
seven seconds, as well as a radar reflector. While not ruling out
human error, officials of the line praised the expertise of Tore
Myrha the captain, and his experience with the company.
</P>
<P>
   All 2,557 passengers were summoned to muster stations by alarms,
outfitted with life jackets and taken ashore by tender boats. No
one was reported hurt, and the company gave passengers refunds and
a certificate for a future cruise. The ship is undergoing repairs
in Mobile, Ala., and is expected to return to service at any time.
The accident, meanwhile, remains under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When the legal precedents recently set in the trial of
President Clinton are used for reference in future court cases,
with what name, as in ``Roe v. Wade,'' will this case be referred
to?
</P>
<P>
   A: The federal civil rights case involving Paula Jones is cited
as ``Paula Corbin Jones v. William Jefferson Clinton, et al.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: I read that Joe DiMaggio's baseball career was interrupted by
three years of military service. What branch was he in, and did he
see combat?
</P>
<P>
   A: DiMaggio didn't see combat. He served for 31 months in the
physical training program for Air Corps cadets in the United States
and Hawaii, but was forced to spend much of the time in a hospital
with stomach ulcers. As a married man older than 28, the Yankee
outfielder was classified 3-A in the World War II draft, but in
February 1943 he enlisted in the Army and ``swapped his
$43,500-a-year baseball salary for a private's $50 a month,'' as
reported in Current Biography (1951). DiMaggio rose to the rank of
staff sergeant.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How did it happen that President Abraham Lincoln, a
Republican, had Andrew Johnson, a Democrat, as a vice president?
</P>
<P>
   A: In 1860, after Lincoln was elected president, Johnson, who
was serving in the Senate, surprised many Southerners by declaring
his loyalty to the Union. When Tennessee seceded in June 1861,
Johnson was the only Southerner to remain in the Senate. In 1862,
after Union forces had captured most of Tennessee, Lincoln
appointed Johnson military governor of his state, and at Johnson's
urging, Tennessee became the only seceding state to outlaw slavery
before the 1863 Emancipation Proclamation.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's loyalty to the Union was rewarded with a vice
presidential nomination in 1864. (Lincoln's original vice
president, Republican Hannibal Hamlin of Maine, was dropped.)
Delegates to the National Union convention in Baltimore _ the
Republican nominating convention expanded to include Democrats
loyal to the Union _ hoped that having a southern Democrat on the
ticket would attract support from northern Democrats and voters in
border areas. Lincoln and Johnson defeated Democrats George
McClellan and George Pendleton by an electoral vote of 212 to 21.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I noticed on C-SPAN's coverage, and in a newspaper photo
Tuesday, that the American flag on the casket of Justice Harry
Blackmun had 48 flags, not 50. Is there an explanation?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. Kathy Arberg, Supreme Court spokeswoman, said the flag
draping Justice Blackmun's casket was the same one that was used on
his father's casket in 1947. The flag didn't get its 49th star (for
A-- aska) until 1959, and its 50th (for Hawaii) until 1960.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I heard that a Boeing 737 experienced a major rudder
malfunction at high altitude. According to the crew, if it had
happened while on final approach, the plane probably would have
crashed. As it was, it made an emergency landing in Baltimore. Do
you have any details?
</P>
<P>
   A: The 737-200, flown by Metrojet, US Airways' new discount
carrier, was cruising at 33,000 feet during a flight Feb. 23 from
Orlando to Hartford, Conn., when it experienced what the National
Transportation Safety Board called ``flight control anomalies.''
</P>
<P>
   The plane started to bank and the pilots saw that the control
wheel had turned left and the rudder pedals were offset, causing
the 737 to start an ``uncommanded roll.'' After switching to backup
systems, the pilots were able to bring the plane back into level
flight and make an emergency landing at Baltimore-Washington
International Airport. None of the 117 people aboard _ 112
passengers, five crew members _ was injured.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation is continuing, but is being hampered because
the aircraft's flight data recorder had already recorded over the
period when the roll started, according to the safety board.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How did baseball great Joe DiMaggio get his nickname ``Yankee
Clipper''? What does it mean?
</P>
<P>
   A: He was called that because of his graceful fielding (think of
a clipper ship moving smoothly and gracefully on the water) and, of
course, his team, the New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've read where a basketball team is a ``dark horse'' in the
NCAA tournament. How did this term originate?
</P>
<P>
   A: Its first appearance was believed to be in Benjamin
Disraeli's ``The Young Duke'' (1831), as a racing term indicating
more than the color of a horse: ``A dark horse, which had never
been thought of, rushed past the grandstand in sweeping triumph.''
Given Disraeli's popularity as a novelist and public figure, it
wasn't long before the term was introduced in American politics to
describe a candidate about whom little is known, or who wins
unexpectedly. The Democratic convention of 1844 produced the first
political ``dark horse'' in James Polk, who went on to become
president, and by 1865 the term was in wide use.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I thought I saw an obituary for Mr. Rogers of children's TV
programming fame. But the other day a news show reported that he
had received an award. So, is he dead or alive?
</P>
<P>
   A: Fred Rogers is very much alive. The board chairman of Family
Communications Inc., he continues to write and produce several
weeks' worth of new programs each season for Mister Rogers'
Neighborhood, the longest-running children's programming on public
television.
</P>
<P>
   A brief bio: Fred McNelly Rogers was born in 1928 in Latrobe,
Pa. After graduating from Rollins College in Florida in 1951, he
was hired by NBC in New York as an assistant producer. In 1952 he
married Joanne Byrd, a pianist and fellow Rollins graduate. Rogers
moved to Pittsburgh in 1953 and developed a program called ``The
Children's Corner'' for WQED, the nation's first
community-supported public TV station. During its seven-year run,
Rogers attended Pittsburgh Theological Seminary and in 1962 was
ordained by the Pittsburgh Presbtytery.
</P>
<P>
   He then went to Toronto, where he developed a children's series
called ``Misterogers,'' and after returning to Pittsburgh he
expanded it. ``Mister Rogers' Neighborhood'' was born.
</P>
<P>
   Far from slowing down, Rogers is about to go online, opening a
new ``neighborhood'' in April: http://www.pbs.org/rogers/

   Q: My children and I were planning a camping vacation to
Yosemite National Park in July, but I'm concerned after hearing
about three women being abducted there. Is Yosemite advising
visitors to do anything?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. As previously reported, the three women were last seen
Feb. 15 near a restaurant and motel outside the park. Yosemite
officials say everything is operating normally inside the park, and
no special advisories have been extended. ``All we can do is tell
visitors to take the normal precautions that any traveler anywhere
would take,'' said park spokeswoman Kathy Farrier.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI, however, continues to ask anyone with information
concerning the women's whereabouts to call 1-800-435-7883.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did the American Airlines pilots union actually pay the
multimillion-dollar contempt-of-court fine levied against it last
month?
</P>
<P>
   A: The union hasn't been fined yet. On Feb. 10, U.S. District
Judge Joe Kendall found the Allied Pilots Association members in
contempt of court for ignoring his order to return to work, and
said he intended to assess fines and damages. The union gave the
court a $10 million deposit toward those fines and damages. On Feb.
17, Kendall extended to May 12 his temporary restraining order. He
also delayed his decision on how to punish the union for originally
ignoring his order to return to work and continued the damages
hearing until April 12.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How is the Dow Jones Industrial Average calculated?
</P>
<P>
   A: Myron Greene, publisher of the Mutual Fund Timing Guide,
explains that in 1896, when Dow Jones &AMP; Co. began computing its
industrial average, it was a simple average of the prices of 12 of
the leading stocks of the day. Such an average is easy to
calculate, but a problem arises when one of the component companies
splits its stock. Suppose the average consists of only two stocks,
each priced at $30 a share. Obviously, the average price is $30.
Now suppose that one of the stocks is split two for one. Each
shareholder ends up with two shares for each one previously held,
but each share is worth only $15, so nothing has really changed for
the shareholder. The split will affect the average, however,
because the new value will be the average of $30 and $15, or
$22.50. It will appear, incorrectly, that the average has suffered
a 25 percent decline.
</P>
<P>
   The method used by Dow Jones to correct this problem is to
change the divisor used to compute the average. In this example,
the sum of $30 and $15 is divided by 1.5 rather than 2, giving the
same value for the average ($30) as before the split. The divisor
also is adjusted when the number of stocks in the average changes
or when a stock in the average is replaced. Because of numerous
adjustments over the past 100 years, the value of the divisor today
is 0.2252. To compute the average, the prices of the 30 stocks in
the average are added together and divided by 0.2252.
</P>
<P>
   Q: During World War II, I spent some time on Corregidor in the
Philippines. What is it like there now?
</P>
<P>
   A: The rocky, fortified island at the entrance to Manila Bay is
one of the only battlefields of World War II readily available to
the history-minded visitor to Asia. Its charms are one of the
better-kept secrets of the region.
</P>
<P>
   The island, sometimes called the Gibraltar of the Pacific, has a
population of about 230. Ruins of the military installation and
ordnance can be inspected by visitors, most of whom come by boat on
day trips from Manila. Those who pay a small surcharge can see a
light and sound show in the shaft of the Malinta Tunnel, which
served as Gen. Douglas MacArthur's headquarters from December 1941
to March 1942. The island has a war museum and memorial, and there
are elaborate plans for restoration. Lodging is available at the
Corregidor Inn.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the real last name of England's royal family?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's Windsor or Mountbatten-Windsor. The dynastic name of
Saxe-Coburg-Gotha (German: Sachsen-Coburg und Gotha) was that of
the German-born husband of Queen Victoria, who died in 1901. Her
husband was Albert, prince consort of Great Britain and Ireland.
Their eldest son was Edward VII. During the anti-German atmosphere
of World War I, George V declared by royal proclamation, on July
17, 1917, that all descendants of Queen Victoria in the male line
who also were British subjects would adopt the surname of Windsor.
</P>
<P>
   Queen Elizabeth II's children normally would have borne their
father's surname, Mountbatten (which itself had been anglicized
from Batternberg). In 1952, however, soon after her accession,
Queen Elizabeth II declared in council that her children and
descendants would bear the surname Windsor. On Feb. 8, 1960, this
decision was modified to the effect that offspring other than those
styled prince or princess and royal highness should bear the name
Mountbatten-Windsor.
</P>
<P>
   Q: After reading about the Los Angeles faults and watching
``Volcano'' and ``Meteor,'' I wonder: Are there any geologically
stable areas in the United States?
</P>
<P>
   A: Some areas are at less risk than others for such natural
hazards as earthquakes, but obviously there are no absolutes. And
someone fearing earthquakes might move from the Far West to the
Midwest only to face varying risks of tornadoes, or to the South or
East to fret about hurricanes. Meteor strikes are impossible to
predict.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Geological Survey maps of the United States depict several
states as free of designated earthquake regions: Florida,
Mississippi, North Dakota, Minnesota and Michigan. These are mostly
earthquake-free: South Carolina, Oregon, Texas, South Dakota,
Nebraska, Indiana, Kentucky, West Virginia and Pennsylvania. The
Geological Survey maps show these states as being free of hurricane
or tornado regions: Washington, Oregon, California, Nevada, Idaho,
Utah, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota, West Virginia, Vermont,
New Hampshire and Maine. Naturally there could be, and have been,
exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   If you're thinking of moving, check the book ``Places Rated
Almanac,'' which has maps and text on climate, natural hazards and
weather extremes.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I greatly admire Oprah Winfrey. What is her educational
background?
</P>
<P>
   A: After graduating from high school in Nashville, she attended
Tennessee State University in Nashville, majoring in the English
language arts. She had won an Elks Club oratorical contest when she
was 16 that guaranteed her a full scholarship to Tennessee State.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I saw an item about an herbal substitute for Viagra,
apparently being produced in China. Can it be purchased in the
United States?
</P>
<P>
   A: Not yet, but herbalists in New York already are predicting
strong sales when the product, called Weige (Big Brother),
eventually makes it to these shores. More than 40 agents across
China have gained permission to sell it, according to a report in
China Daily, and nearly 100 foreign traders have asked for samples
and hope to become agents outside China.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese company behind Weige says it's safer, healthier and
cheaper than Viagra. Its packaging is designed to look foreign,
featuring a photograph of an Adonis statue, flying doves and
cavorting women in bikinis. Jiang Wei, chairman of Shenyang
Feilong, the drug company, predicts big sales in China: ``We are
going to sell 100 million pills this year. Our Weige works better
than Viagra, and it is all herbal, so it does not have any side
effects.'' In China, a packet of eight Weige pills sells for $11.
Weige hasn't undergone independent clinical trials, but Jiang said
tests had been performed on volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What was Ronald Reagan's first film?
</P>
<P>
   A: It was ``Love Is On the Air'' (1937). Reagan played a
small-town radio announcer, Andy McLeod, who told too much in his
news broadcasts about corrupt local politicians and was demoted to
children's programs. But McLeod persevered, exposed the crooks, and
won the girl, portrayed by June Travis.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you explain the origin and meaning of the ``Esq.''
designation that some men use after their name? Are there certain
requirements for using it?
</P>
<P>
   A: Esquire is the slightly older version of squire, as taken
into English at the time of the Norman conquest from the French
esquier, meaning ``shield bearer.'' The earliest squires, or
esquires, were candidates for knighthood. After the flowering of
knighthood had passed, the words Squire and Esquire (now with
capital letters) were used to designate men slightly above the rank
of tradespeople. Since they often were looked to as leaders, they
often served as magistrates in local courts, and the term Squire
came to be used more and more as a form of address for judges and
other local dignitaries.
</P>
<P>
   Today it's rarely seen, at least in the United States, except as
a courtesy title for some attorneys. There aren't any requirements
about the use of Esq., but since it's basically limited to the
legal profession, anyone else tacking it onto his (or her) name
might be accused of trying to pass himself off as a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the name of the agency Jane Fonda founded to fight
teen pregnancy, and how may I contact it?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's the Georgia Campaign for Adolescent Pregnancy
Prevention. Write to G-CAPP, One CNN Center, Suite 610, North
Tower, Atlanta, GA 30303; or call 404-524-2277.
</P>
<P>
   Q: During his moviemaking days, actor Charlton Heston, president
of the National Rifle Association, played everything from Moses to
Admiral Nimitz. Did he ever serve in the military? What about Rep.
Bob Barr (R-Ga.), who is on the NRA's board?
</P>
<P>
   A: After graduating from high school in 1941, Heston enrolled at
Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., on a drama scholarship.
After completing two years, he left college to enlist in the Army
Air Corps. He spent most of his three-year tour of duty stationed
in the Aleutian Islands, where he was a radio-gunner on bombers. As
reported previously, Barr was never in the armed services.
</P>
<P>
   Q: At the recently concluded Clinton impeachment trial, Chief
Justice William Rehnquist stated two words, possibly in Latin, when
he sounded the gavel to indicate the end of the trial. What were
those words?
</P>
<P>
   A: Rehnquist uttered the expression sine die, which means
``without day'' or ``without assigning a day for a further meeting
or hearing.'' It's traditionally spoken when a legislative body
adjourns without appointing a day on which to assemble again.
</P>
<P>
   Q: An article about a forecast for drought and fires this summer
mentioned something called the Palmer Drought Severity Index. I've
never heard of that. Who was Palmer? How is the index calculated?
</P>
<P>
   A: The PDSI was developed in the early- to mid-'60s, and was
first published in 1965 by Wayne C. Palmer, a meteorologist with
the U.S. Weather Bureau's Office of Climatology. It depicts
prolonged _ meaning months and years _ abnormal dryness or wetness
and reflects the general long-term status of water supplies in
aquifers, reservoirs and streams. It compares the actual amount of
precipitation received in an area during a specified time period
with the normal or average amount expected over that same period.
The index is calculated based on precipitation and temperature
data, as well as the local available water content of the soil.
Human impacts on the water balance, such as irrigation, aren't
considered.
</P>
<P>
   While the PDSI has been used for years, and is ``ingrained
within a lot of legislation and a lot of agencies within the
government,'' a newer index has been developed to provide drought
data more quickly, said Mark Svoboda, a climatologist with the
National Drought Mitigation Center at the University of
Nebraska-Lincoln. The SPI, based only on precipitation, provides
data within six to eight weeks, Svoboda said, which sometimes can
be handier than the more complex PDSI formulation.
</P>
<P>
   Details are available online at http:enso.unl.edu/ndmc, under
the drought watch section.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In connection with Joe DiMaggio's death, I noticed that all
three brothers who played Major League baseball had the same middle
name: Paul. Was their father named Paul?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. Joe was the eighth of nine children and the fourth of
five sons of Joseph Paul and Rosalia DiMaggio. His two ballplaying
brothers were Dom and Vince. Their parents had come from Isola
della Femmine, off the coast of Sicily, where the father's name was
spelled Giuseppe Paolo DiMaggio.

   Q: How old is Elizabeth Dole? Absolutely no one has mentioned
it, either on television or in the newspaper. Her husband is in his
late 70s. She has got to be too old to run for president.
</P>
<P>
   A: Her age is no secret and has been included often in
Journal-Constitution articles, such as one published Jan. 15 when
she stepped down as president of the American Red Cross. But for
the record, here it is again: She's 62. She will be 63 on July 29.
Bob Dole will be 76 on July 22.
</P>
<P>
   You may be a ``what if'' kind of person, wondering what if she
decides officially to run as the Republican candidate for
president, and what if she wins the nomination, and what if she
wins the election and takes office Jan. 20, 2001. If all that were
to happen, she would be 64 on that date. The oldest president
inaugurated the first time was Ronald Reagan, who was 69 years and
349 days old when taking office on Jan. 20, 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are the codes stamped on the bottom of canned goods? It
is done in a way to keep consumers from knowing the expiration
date?
</P>
<P>
   A: Codes on canned goods aren't a way to conceal expiration
dates; they provide manufacturers with information they need to
ensure product safety. Using the code, the manufacturers can
identify the plant where the product was processed, the processing
line it was run on, and when and where the product originated.
</P>
<P>
   Commercially canned goods are safe to eat even after long
periods of storage unless the cans are bulging, leaking or badly
rusted. Perhaps you could write dates on cans to help with your
``first in, first out'' system of rotating stocks. For the best
quality _ flavor, texture and color _ canned goods should be used
within a year of purchase.

<P>
   Q: Last December, a Royal Caribbean cruise ship was involved in
an accident off St. Maarten that caused serious damage. I never
heard an explanation of the accident, or whose fault it was. Do you
have any information?
</P>
<P>
   A: The accident occurred the night of Dec. 14-15 when the
Monarch of the Seas struck Proselyte Reef less than a mile outside
the entrance to Philipsburg harbor, opening a 3-by-60-foot gash in
the hull. The vessel, which had sailed from San Juan, Puerto Rico,
had made an unscheduled stop at St. Maarten to evacuate a passenger
who had an apparent heart attack. As it was leaving, in darkness,
the ship struck the shoal and began taking on water, so the crew
decided to run it aground on soft sand. Reports indicated three of
the Monarch 's 18 watertight compartments had filled with water.
</P>
<P>
   Royal Caribbean officials couldn't immediately explain the cause
of the accident, because the reef is identified on all navigational
charts and has a floating buoy with a light that flashes every
seven seconds, as well as a radar reflector. While not ruling out
human error, officials of the line praised the expertise of Tore
Myrha the captain, and his experience with the company.
</P>
<P>
   All 2,557 passengers were summoned to muster stations by alarms,
outfitted with life jackets and taken ashore by tender boats. No
one was reported hurt, and the company gave passengers refunds and
a certificate for a future cruise. The ship is undergoing repairs
in Mobile, Ala., and is expected to return to service at any time.
The accident, meanwhile, remains under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When the legal precedents recently set in the trial of
President Clinton are used for reference in future court cases,
with what name, as in ``Roe v. Wade,'' will this case be referred
to?
</P>
<P>
   A: The federal civil rights case involving Paula Jones is cited
as ``Paula Corbin Jones v. William Jefferson Clinton, et al.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: I read that Joe DiMaggio's baseball career was interrupted by
three years of military service. What branch was he in, and did he
see combat?
</P>
<P>
   A: DiMaggio didn't see combat. He served for 31 months in the
physical training program for Air Corps cadets in the United States
and Hawaii, but was forced to spend much of the time in a hospital
with stomach ulcers. As a married man older than 28, the Yankee
outfielder was classified 3-A in the World War II draft, but in
February 1943 he enlisted in the Army and ``swapped his
$43,500-a-year baseball salary for a private's $50 a month,'' as
reported in Current Biography (1951). DiMaggio rose to the rank of
staff sergeant.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How did it happen that President Abraham Lincoln, a
Republican, had Andrew Johnson, a Democrat, as a vice president?
</P>
<P>
   A: In 1860, after Lincoln was elected president, Johnson, who
was serving in the Senate, surprised many Southerners by declaring
his loyalty to the Union. When Tennessee seceded in June 1861,
Johnson was the only Southerner to remain in the Senate. In 1862,
after Union forces had captured most of Tennessee, Lincoln
appointed Johnson military governor of his state, and at Johnson's
urging, Tennessee became the only seceding state to outlaw slavery
before the 1863 Emancipation Proclamation.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's loyalty to the Union was rewarded with a vice
presidential nomination in 1864. (Lincoln's original vice
president, Republican Hannibal Hamlin of Maine, was dropped.)
Delegates to the National Union convention in Baltimore _ the
Republican nominating convention expanded to include Democrats
loyal to the Union _ hoped that having a southern Democrat on the
ticket would attract support from northern Democrats and voters in
border areas. Lincoln and Johnson defeated Democrats George
McClellan and George Pendleton by an electoral vote of 212 to 21.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I noticed on C-SPAN's coverage, and in a newspaper photo
Tuesday, that the American flag on the casket of Justice Harry
Blackmun had 48 flags, not 50. Is there an explanation?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. Kathy Arberg, Supreme Court spokeswoman, said the flag
draping Justice Blackmun's casket was the same one that was used on
his father's casket in 1947. The flag didn't get its 49th star (for
A-- aska) until 1959, and its 50th (for Hawaii) until 1960.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I heard that a Boeing 737 experienced a major rudder
malfunction at high altitude. According to the crew, if it had
happened while on final approach, the plane probably would have
crashed. As it was, it made an emergency landing in Baltimore. Do
you have any details?
</P>
<P>
   A: The 737-200, flown by Metrojet, US Airways' new discount
carrier, was cruising at 33,000 feet during a flight Feb. 23 from
Orlando to Hartford, Conn., when it experienced what the National
Transportation Safety Board called ``flight control anomalies.''
</P>
<P>
   The plane started to bank and the pilots saw that the control
wheel had turned left and the rudder pedals were offset, causing
the 737 to start an ``uncommanded roll.'' After switching to backup
systems, the pilots were able to bring the plane back into level
flight and make an emergency landing at Baltimore-Washington
International Airport. None of the 117 people aboard _ 112
passengers, five crew members _ was injured.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation is continuing, but is being hampered because
the aircraft's flight data recorder had already recorded over the
period when the roll started, according to the safety board.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How did baseball great Joe DiMaggio get his nickname ``Yankee
Clipper''? What does it mean?
</P>
<P>
   A: He was called that because of his graceful fielding (think of
a clipper ship moving smoothly and gracefully on the water) and, of
course, his team, the New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've read where a basketball team is a ``dark horse'' in the
NCAA tournament. How did this term originate?
</P>
<P>
   A: Its first appearance was believed to be in Benjamin
Disraeli's ``The Young Duke'' (1831), as a racing term indicating
more than the color of a horse: ``A dark horse, which had never
been thought of, rushed past the grandstand in sweeping triumph.''
Given Disraeli's popularity as a novelist and public figure, it
wasn't long before the term was introduced in American politics to
describe a candidate about whom little is known, or who wins
unexpectedly. The Democratic convention of 1844 produced the first
political ``dark horse'' in James Polk, who went on to become
president, and by 1865 the term was in wide use.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I thought I saw an obituary for Mr. Rogers of children's TV
programming fame. But the other day a news show reported that he
had received an award. So, is he dead or alive?
</P>
<P>
   A: Fred Rogers is very much alive. The board chairman of Family
Communications Inc., he continues to write and produce several
weeks' worth of new programs each season for Mister Rogers'
Neighborhood, the longest-running children's programming on public
television.
</P>
<P>
   A brief bio: Fred McNelly Rogers was born in 1928 in Latrobe,
Pa. After graduating from Rollins College in Florida in 1951, he
was hired by NBC in New York as an assistant producer. In 1952 he
married Joanne Byrd, a pianist and fellow Rollins graduate. Rogers
moved to Pittsburgh in 1953 and developed a program called ``The
Children's Corner'' for WQED, the nation's first
community-supported public TV station. During its seven-year run,
Rogers attended Pittsburgh Theological Seminary and in 1962 was
ordained by the Pittsburgh Presbtytery.
</P>
<P>
   He then went to Toronto, where he developed a children's series
called ``Misterogers,'' and after returning to Pittsburgh he
expanded it. ``Mister Rogers' Neighborhood'' was born.
</P>
<P>
   Far from slowing down, Rogers is about to go online, opening a
new ``neighborhood'' in April: http://www.pbs.org/rogers/

   If medical researchers fail to cook up a cure for the common
cold in our lifetime, it won't be for lack of trying. Despite its
name, the common cold is caused by not one common virus but five
different viral families, encompassing a couple of hundred unique
viral strains among them.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, there is a chance that a cure, or at least a
viable treatment, is in the works. Luck played an important part in
the story of a molecule known by the name of intercellular adhesion
molecule 1, or ICAM-1 _ one of a group of molecules that sit on the
surface of cells and adhere to other cells when the need arises.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers noticed that ICAM-1 protrudes from cells in your
nasal cavity and acts as the entryway by which most members of one
family of common cold viruses, known as rhinoviruses, penetrates
your cells, infecting them. The history of the discovery of ICAM-1
is a scientific tale of collaboration, competition and chance.
</P>
<P>
   The story starts with Timothy Springer, a biochemist turned
immunologist at the Harvard Medical School. In the early 1980s,
Springer was studying lymphocytes, white blood cells that do much
of the work of fighting off infections and defending against any
bacteria or viruses that might invade your personal space. To do
their jobs, lymphocytes must stick to other cells.
</P>
<P>
   When Springer began his research, no one knew quite how this
stickiness was achieved. In 1981 he and his colleagues identified a
single molecule that seemed crucial to the adhesive aspect of a
type of lymphocyte known as a killer T cell. Because Springer had
only a general idea of what this molecule actually did, he gave it
a generic name, lymphocyte function associated antigen (LFA-1), and
set out to learn whether his hunch was true, and if so, why.
</P>
<P>
   One of the people Springer called was a colleague at the
University of Pennsylvania who had heard a talk by a pediatrician
named Donald Anderson. ``In 1982,'' Anderson says, ``I received a
letter from a child's father. The girl was very young, maybe 2 or
3. The letter just said, 'My daughter has all kinds of strange
infections. Would anybody in the state of Texas have any interest
in taking care of her?' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``I called him and did a variety of studies on her. What we
noticed was that her white blood cells lacked the capacity to stick
to surfaces. They would slide right off glass or protein surfaces,
which is very unusual. White blood cells usually stick avidly to
almost everything.'' By 1985, Anderson had located a half dozen
similar patients in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   After Anderson's colleague told Springer about him, the two
began working together. Studying blood samples from Anderson's
patients, they verified that the white blood cells would not clump
together, as normal white blood cells do, thus strongly suggesting
they were missing LFA-1. Further research showed that the protein
was indeed missing.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986 the team published the result: LFA-1's target was
ICAM-1. The discovery launched an entire field of biology dedicated
to the study of cellular adhesion in the immune system.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, Richard Colonno, then a molecular biologist at Merck,
now a vice president of infectious-disease drug discovery at
Bristol-Myers Squibb, showed definitively that 90 percent of all
rhinoviruses used one receptor, and the other 10 percent used
another. It meant 90 percent of half of the common cold viruses
might be stopped with the same drug, which was a large enough
percentage to justify developing a treatment and putting it on the
market.
</P>
<P>
   During the mid-'80s, Colonno and his colleagues produced an
antibody that attacked the receptor and blocked the virus from
getting into the cell and replicating _ at least in a test tube.
But when they tried to come up with a cheap version of the
antibody, they failed.
</P>
<P>
   Colonno's work, however, had spawned competition from the work
of two molecular biologists, Jeffrey Greve and Alan McClelland who
worked for Molecular Therapeutics. McClelland and Greve tried to
nail down the receptor's identity, and succeeded in pinpointing the
gene that coded for the rhinovirus receptor as well as the receptor
itself.
</P>
<P>
   Greve's laboratory purified the protein and sequenced it,
creating a precise map of the string of amino acids that composed
the protein. When researchers in Greve's lab compared their
sequence with those in a computer database of proteins previously
sequenced by other researchers, ICAM-1 matched perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went to the library ... to find out what ICAM-1 was, and
came up Springer's group,'' McClelland says. Springer's ``group''
now included a pair of former researchers _ Robert Rothlein and
Steven Marlin _ who were working at Boehringer Ingleheim.
</P>
<P>
   Once Greve and McClelland realized ICAM-1 was the rhinovirus
receptor, word began to spread. Marlin got a call asking him if
ICAM-1 could be the receptor.
</P>
<P>
   ``In very short order,'' Marlin says, ''we put together concrete
information that ICAM-1 was the receptor to a major group of
rhinoviruses.''
</P>
<P>
   During the next decade BI and Bayer, the company that owns
Molecular Therapeutics, raced to get a cold cure to market first.
Both teams hit on the same strategy. They produced a form of ICAM-1
that was not rooted in the cell walls but was soluble. They could
squirt it into noses in the hope that the rhinovirus would snatch
up the free-floating ICAM-1 and never get around to grabbing the
ICAM-1 receptors that let it into the cells. The strategy is a
''decoy effect,'' Marlin says.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of problems had to be solved first, however. For
instance, your nose produces mucus as a barrier to foreign
particles. Could soluble ICAM-1 survive, or would the mucus break
it down and wash it away before it had the chance to decoy any
rhinovirus?
</P>
<P>
   The researchers also had to prove that the soluble ICAM would
work on all or most of the 90-plus strains of rhinovirus.
Reassuringly, their experiments showed that the virus seemed to
remain susceptible to the ICAM decoys, at least in test tubes.
</P>
<P>
   Whether ICAM is good enough to make a marketable cold treatment
remains to be seen. McClelland, for one, calls it a good shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's the kind of approach that, even if it doesn't
work, will certainly have advanced our understanding quite a bit.
And _ who knows? _ maybe it will work. The common cold has caused
enough problems for us all. It would be nice to have something you
could just take and be done with it.''

   &UR; WHAT'S A PINNA FOR? &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The folds of the outer ear _ the pinna _ seem gratuitous, a
waste of cartilage and skin. But they are, some Dutch researchers
have found, crucial to our ability to pinpoint the vertical
location of sounds _ whether they come from above us, below, in
front, or behind. When a sound wave enters the outer ear, it
bounces around the pinna's ridges. Some frequencies are enhanced,
others diminished, with the pattern of those changes determined by
the particular shape of the pinna. Since everyone's pinnae are
different, so is the acoustic stamp placed on sound entering the
brain.
</P>
<P>
   Biophysicist John van Opstal, who works at the University of
Nijmegen in The Netherlands, and his colleagues placed plastic
molds inside their own ears (and those of a student) to alter the
shape of their pinnae and wore them day and night for six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The new ``earprint,'' Van Opstal surmised, would have to be
learned by the brain if he and his colleagues were to retain their
normal hearing. (The brain determines horizontal distance to a
sound's source by measuring the differences between the two ears in
the arrival time and loudness of the sound waves.) Initially, in
tests in a darkened laboratory, none of the subjects could
determine the vertical source of a sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you position the source of a sound at many random locations
_ up and to the right, down and to the left _ the subject thinks
that the sound is moving only in the horizontal direction and not
at all in the vertical,'' Van Opstal says. But after four or five
days, three of the subjects began to regain their normal hearing.
(The fourth took almost three weeks.)
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the hearing of all four returned to normal, and
remained so when they took out the molds, which suggests that the
brain can learn and retain many auditory maps. Interestingly, the
subjects noticed no difference in their hearing during the
experiment while they were outside the lab, even at the beginning
of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the reason is that our visual system tells us where a
sound is coming from, although our auditory system tells us
something different,'' Van Opstal says. ``So the visual system is
the driving force that trains the auditory system, by correlating
what is seen with what is heard.''

 &UR; CRANE SURGEON &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Eduard, a rare Siberian crane, suffered from severe arthritis
for five years. In the wild, Siberian cranes stand on soft, mushy
marshland. In zoos, however, where the birds typically live on hard
surfaces, arthritis is not uncommon.
</P>
<P>
   Since neither painkillers nor anti-inflammatory medication could
ease Eduard's pain, surgeons recently implanted an artificial joint
in his left ankle. The procedure, never tried on a bird, was
performed by Avery Bennett, an assistant professor of wildlife and
zoological medicine at the University of Florida, and Eugene
O'Brien, a hand surgeon with the Hand Center in San Antonio, Texas.

 &UR; HOW TO GROW BONES FROM SCRATCH &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When surgeons need to graft bone _ for, say, reconstructing
someone's face after an accident _ they dig it out of another part
of the patient's body, usually the pelvis. ``It's a painful
operation,'' says John Davies, a dentist and biomedical engineer at
the University of Toronto. ``And because the patient must undergo
essentially two operations, he has to stay on the operating table
for a longer time. That's more costly and means a longer recovery
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Davies and his colleagues have found a way to avoid that first,
bone-harvesting operation. They've developed a polymer scaffold
that mimics the structure of real bone. In particular, it's
designed to work like trabecular bone _ the spongy bone beneath the
skeleton's hard outer shell. Like trabecular bone, the matrix has
countless interconnected pores, each about a millimeter in size.
Nestled within those pores are both osteoclasts (bone-eating cells)
and osteoblasts (bone-making cells). When the synthetic bone is
transplanted, those cells spread and grow new bone, healing the
injury.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have tried to seed bones onto a scaffold before,
Davies says, but with little luck. Some groups tried a matrix of
calcium phosphate _ the mineral that makes up coral. ``It works
extremely well when it comes to growing cells, but when it's put in
the body it's not absorbed. It just stays there. So that's not a
very good long-term strategy,'' he says. Other researchers have
tried biodegradable foams, but the pores in the foam are so small
that bone cells can't penetrate them.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they make bone, it's only as a shell formed on the
surface,'' Davies adds. By tinkering with two manufacturing
processes commonly used to make biodegradable foams, Davies has
made a foam that has much larger pores _ about the same size as the
pores in real spongy bone. ``When we seed the scaffold with cells,
the cells grow right through and penetrate to a depth of up to
about half an inch, so they make bone in a three-dimensional
configuration,'' he says. ``We haven't gone any deeper than that,
and we don't plan to, because when surgeons remove bone for
grafting, they only chip out tiny bits of bone, and we are trying
to create an alternative.'' Davies plans to test the synthetic bone
in simple dental surgeries within a year.

   &UR; WHAT'S A PINNA FOR? &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The folds of the outer ear _ the pinna _ seem gratuitous, a
waste of cartilage and skin. But they are, some Dutch researchers
have found, crucial to our ability to pinpoint the vertical
location of sounds _ whether they come from above us, below, in
front, or behind. When a sound wave enters the outer ear, it
bounces around the pinna's ridges. Some frequencies are enhanced,
others diminished, with the pattern of those changes determined by
the particular shape of the pinna. Since everyone's pinnae are
different, so is the acoustic stamp placed on sound entering the
brain.
</P>
<P>
   Biophysicist John van Opstal, who works at the University of
Nijmegen in The Netherlands, and his colleagues placed plastic
molds inside their own ears (and those of a student) to alter the
shape of their pinnae and wore them day and night for six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The new ``earprint,'' Van Opstal surmised, would have to be
learned by the brain if he and his colleagues were to retain their
normal hearing. (The brain determines horizontal distance to a
sound's source by measuring the differences between the two ears in
the arrival time and loudness of the sound waves.) Initially, in
tests in a darkened laboratory, none of the subjects could
determine the vertical source of a sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you position the source of a sound at many random locations
_ up and to the right, down and to the left _ the subject thinks
that the sound is moving only in the horizontal direction and not
at all in the vertical,'' Van Opstal says. But after four or five
days, three of the subjects began to regain their normal hearing.
(The fourth took almost three weeks.)
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the hearing of all four returned to normal, and
remained so when they took out the molds, which suggests that the
brain can learn and retain many auditory maps. Interestingly, the
subjects noticed no difference in their hearing during the
experiment while they were outside the lab, even at the beginning
of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the reason is that our visual system tells us where a
sound is coming from, although our auditory system tells us
something different,'' Van Opstal says. ``So the visual system is
the driving force that trains the auditory system, by correlating
what is seen with what is heard.''

 &UR; CRANE SURGEON &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Eduard, a rare Siberian crane, suffered from severe arthritis
for five years. In the wild, Siberian cranes stand on soft, mushy
marshland. In zoos, however, where the birds typically live on hard
surfaces, arthritis is not uncommon.
</P>
<P>
   Since neither painkillers nor anti-inflammatory medication could
ease Eduard's pain, surgeons recently implanted an artificial joint
in his left ankle. The procedure, never tried on a bird, was
performed by Avery Bennett, an assistant professor of wildlife and
zoological medicine at the University of Florida, and Eugene
O'Brien, a hand surgeon with the Hand Center in San Antonio, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   In a four-hour operation at the University of Florida Veterinary
Medical Teaching Hospital, the surgeons replaced part of the ankle
joint with a flexible plastic device about the size of a
clothespin, normally used as an artificial joint in the big toes of
humans. Eduard is now recovering nicely, say his keepers.

<P>
   If medical researchers fail to cook up a cure for the common
cold in our lifetime, it won't be for lack of trying. Despite its
name, the common cold is caused by not one common virus but five
different viral families, encompassing a couple of hundred unique
viral strains among them.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, there is a chance that a cure, or at least a
viable treatment, is in the works. Luck played an important part in
the story of a molecule known by the name of intercellular adhesion
molecule 1, or ICAM-1 _ one of a group of molecules that sit on the
surface of cells and adhere to other cells when the need arises.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers noticed that ICAM-1 protrudes from cells in your
nasal cavity and acts as the entryway by which most members of one
family of common cold viruses, known as rhinoviruses, penetrates
your cells, infecting them. The history of the discovery of ICAM-1
is a scientific tale of collaboration, competition and chance.
</P>
<P>
   The story starts with Timothy Springer, a biochemist turned
immunologist at the Harvard Medical School. In the early 1980s,
Springer was studying lymphocytes, white blood cells that do much
of the work of fighting off infections and defending against any
bacteria or viruses that might invade your personal space. To do
their jobs, lymphocytes must stick to other cells.
</P>
<P>
   When Springer began his research, no one knew quite how this
stickiness was achieved. In 1981 he and his colleagues identified a
single molecule that seemed crucial to the adhesive aspect of a
type of lymphocyte known as a killer T cell. Because Springer had
only a general idea of what this molecule actually did, he gave it
a generic name, lymphocyte function associated antigen (LFA-1), and
set out to learn whether his hunch was true, and if so, why.
</P>
<P>
   One of the people Springer called was a colleague at the
University of Pennsylvania who had heard a talk by a pediatrician
named Donald Anderson. ``In 1982,'' Anderson says, ``I received a
letter from a child's father. The girl was very young, maybe 2 or
3. The letter just said, 'My daughter has all kinds of strange
infections. Would anybody in the state of Texas have any interest
in taking care of her?' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``I called him and did a variety of studies on her. What we
noticed was that her white blood cells lacked the capacity to stick
to surfaces. They would slide right off glass or protein surfaces,
which is very unusual. White blood cells usually stick avidly to
almost everything.'' By 1985, Anderson had located a half dozen
similar patients in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   After Anderson's colleague told Springer about him, the two
began working together. Studying blood samples from Anderson's
patients, they verified that the white blood cells would not clump
together, as normal white blood cells do, thus strongly suggesting
they were missing LFA-1. Further research showed that the protein
was indeed missing.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986 the team published the result: LFA-1's target was
ICAM-1. The discovery launched an entire field of biology dedicated
to the study of cellular adhesion in the immune system.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, Richard Colonno, then a molecular biologist at Merck,
now a vice president of infectious-disease drug discovery at
Bristol-Myers Squibb, showed definitively that 90 percent of all
rhinoviruses used one receptor, and the other 10 percent used
another. It meant 90 percent of half of the common cold viruses
might be stopped with the same drug, which was a large enough
percentage to justify developing a treatment and putting it on the
market.
</P>
<P>
   During the mid-'80s, Colonno and his colleagues produced an
antibody that attacked the receptor and blocked the virus from
getting into the cell and replicating _ at least in a test tube.
But when they tried to come up with a cheap version of the
antibody, they failed.
</P>
<P>
   Colonno's work, however, had spawned competition from the work
of two molecular biologists, Jeffrey Greve and Alan McClelland who
worked for Molecular Therapeutics. McClelland and Greve tried to
nail down the receptor's identity, and succeeded in pinpointing the
gene that coded for the rhinovirus receptor as well as the receptor
itself.
</P>
<P>
   Greve's laboratory purified the protein and sequenced it,
creating a precise map of the string of amino acids that composed
the protein. When researchers in Greve's lab compared their
sequence with those in a computer database of proteins previously
sequenced by other researchers, ICAM-1 matched perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went to the library ... to find out what ICAM-1 was, and
came up Springer's group,'' McClelland says. Springer's ``group''
now included a pair of former researchers _ Robert Rothlein and
Steven Marlin _ who were working at Boehringer Ingleheim.
</P>
<P>
   Once Greve and McClelland realized ICAM-1 was the rhinovirus
receptor, word began to spread. Marlin got a call asking him if
ICAM-1 could be the receptor.
</P>
<P>
   ``In very short order,'' Marlin says, ''we put together concrete
information that ICAM-1 was the receptor to a major group of
rhinoviruses.''
</P>
<P>
   During the next decade BI and Bayer, the company that owns
Molecular Therapeutics, raced to get a cold cure to market first.
Both teams hit on the same strategy. They produced a form of ICAM-1
that was not rooted in the cell walls but was soluble. They could
squirt it into noses in the hope that the rhinovirus would snatch
up the free-floating ICAM-1 and never get around to grabbing the
ICAM-1 receptors that let it into the cells. The strategy is a
''decoy effect,'' Marlin says.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of problems had to be solved first, however. For
instance, your nose produces mucus as a barrier to foreign
particles. Could soluble ICAM-1 survive, or would the mucus break
it down and wash it away before it had the chance to decoy any
rhinovirus?
</P>
<P>
   The researchers also had to prove that the soluble ICAM would
work on all or most of the 90-plus strains of rhinovirus.
Reassuringly, their experiments showed that the virus seemed to
remain susceptible to the ICAM decoys, at least in test tubes.
</P>
<P>
   Whether ICAM is good enough to make a marketable cold treatment
remains to be seen. McClelland, for one, calls it a good shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's the kind of approach that, even if it doesn't
work, will certainly have advanced our understanding quite a bit.
And _ who knows? _ maybe it will work. The common cold has caused
enough problems for us all. It would be nice to have something you
could just take and be done with it.''

   &UR; WHAT'S A PINNA FOR? &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The folds of the outer ear _ the pinna _ seem gratuitous, a
waste of cartilage and skin. But they are, some Dutch researchers
have found, crucial to our ability to pinpoint the vertical
location of sounds _ whether they come from above us, below, in
front, or behind. When a sound wave enters the outer ear, it
bounces around the pinna's ridges. Some frequencies are enhanced,
others diminished, with the pattern of those changes determined by
the particular shape of the pinna. Since everyone's pinnae are
different, so is the acoustic stamp placed on sound entering the
brain.
</P>
<P>
   Biophysicist John van Opstal, who works at the University of
Nijmegen in The Netherlands, and his colleagues placed plastic
molds inside their own ears (and those of a student) to alter the
shape of their pinnae and wore them day and night for six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The new ``earprint,'' Van Opstal surmised, would have to be
learned by the brain if he and his colleagues were to retain their
normal hearing. (The brain determines horizontal distance to a
sound's source by measuring the differences between the two ears in
the arrival time and loudness of the sound waves.) Initially, in
tests in a darkened laboratory, none of the subjects could
determine the vertical source of a sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you position the source of a sound at many random locations
_ up and to the right, down and to the left _ the subject thinks
that the sound is moving only in the horizontal direction and not
at all in the vertical,'' Van Opstal says. But after four or five
days, three of the subjects began to regain their normal hearing.
(The fourth took almost three weeks.)
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the hearing of all four returned to normal, and
remained so when they took out the molds, which suggests that the
brain can learn and retain many auditory maps. Interestingly, the
subjects noticed no difference in their hearing during the
experiment while they were outside the lab, even at the beginning
of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the reason is that our visual system tells us where a
sound is coming from, although our auditory system tells us
something different,'' Van Opstal says. ``So the visual system is
the driving force that trains the auditory system, by correlating
what is seen with what is heard.''

 &UR; CRANE SURGEON &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Eduard, a rare Siberian crane, suffered from severe arthritis
for five years. In the wild, Siberian cranes stand on soft, mushy
marshland. In zoos, however, where the birds typically live on hard
surfaces, arthritis is not uncommon.
</P>
<P>
   Since neither painkillers nor anti-inflammatory medication could
ease Eduard's pain, surgeons recently implanted an artificial joint
in his left ankle. The procedure, never tried on a bird, was
performed by Avery Bennett, an assistant professor of wildlife and
zoological medicine at the University of Florida, and Eugene
O'Brien, a hand surgeon with the Hand Center in San Antonio, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   In a four-hour operation at the University of Florida Veterinary
Medical Teaching Hospital, the surgeons replaced part of the ankle
joint with a flexible plastic device about the size of a
clothespin, normally used as an artificial joint in the big toes of
humans. Eduard is now recovering nicely, say his keepers.
</P>
<P>
   While the bird's surgery may be used to help other arthritic
cranes, younger, healthy captive birds need preventive care. The
International Crane Foundation in Baraboo, Wis., Eduard's home,
plans to build shallow, soft wetland environments to better
accommodate its 17 Siberian cranes.

 &UR; HOW TO GROW BONES FROM SCRATCH &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When surgeons need to graft bone _ for, say, reconstructing
someone's face after an accident _ they dig it out of another part
of the patient's body, usually the pelvis. ``It's a painful
operation,'' says John Davies, a dentist and biomedical engineer at
the University of Toronto. ``And because the patient must undergo
essentially two operations, he has to stay on the operating table
for a longer time. That's more costly and means a longer recovery
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Davies and his colleagues have found a way to avoid that first,
bone-harvesting operation. They've developed a polymer scaffold
that mimics the structure of real bone. In particular, it's
designed to work like trabecular bone _ the spongy bone beneath the
skeleton's hard outer shell. Like trabecular bone, the matrix has
countless interconnected pores, each about a millimeter in size.
Nestled within those pores are both osteoclasts (bone-eating cells)
and osteoblasts (bone-making cells). When the synthetic bone is
transplanted, those cells spread and grow new bone, healing the
injury.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have tried to seed bones onto a scaffold before,
Davies says, but with little luck. Some groups tried a matrix of
calcium phosphate _ the mineral that makes up coral. ``It works
extremely well when it comes to growing cells, but when it's put in
the body it's not absorbed. It just stays there. So that's not a
very good long-term strategy,'' he says. Other researchers have
tried biodegradable foams, but the pores in the foam are so small
that bone cells can't penetrate them.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they make bone, it's only as a shell formed on the
surface,'' Davies adds. By tinkering with two manufacturing
processes commonly used to make biodegradable foams, Davies has
made a foam that has much larger pores _ about the same size as the
pores in real spongy bone. ``When we seed the scaffold with cells,
the cells grow right through and penetrate to a depth of up to
about half an inch, so they make bone in a three-dimensional
configuration,'' he says. ``We haven't gone any deeper than that,
and we don't plan to, because when surgeons remove bone for
grafting, they only chip out tiny bits of bone, and we are trying
to create an alternative.'' Davies plans to test the synthetic bone
in simple dental surgeries within a year.

   If medical researchers fail to cook up a cure for the common
cold in our lifetime, it won't be for lack of trying. Despite its
name, the common cold is caused by not one common virus but five
different viral families, encompassing a couple of hundred unique
viral strains among them.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, there is a chance that a cure, or at least a
viable treatment, is in the works. Luck played an important part in
the story of a molecule known by the name of intercellular adhesion
molecule 1, or ICAM-1 _ one of a group of molecules that sit on the
surface of cells and adhere to other cells when the need arises.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers noticed that ICAM-1 protrudes from cells in your
nasal cavity and acts as the entryway by which most members of one
family of common cold viruses, known as rhinoviruses, penetrates
your cells, infecting them. The history of the discovery of ICAM-1
is a scientific tale of collaboration, competition and chance.
</P>
<P>
   The story starts with Timothy Springer, a biochemist turned
immunologist at the Harvard Medical School. In the early 1980s,
Springer was studying lymphocytes, white blood cells that do much
of the work of fighting off infections and defending against any
bacteria or viruses that might invade your personal space. To do
their jobs, lymphocytes must stick to other cells.
</P>
<P>
   When Springer began his research, no one knew quite how this
stickiness was achieved. In 1981 he and his colleagues identified a
single molecule that seemed crucial to the adhesive aspect of a
type of lymphocyte known as a killer T cell. Because Springer had
only a general idea of what this molecule actually did, he gave it
a generic name, lymphocyte function associated antigen (LFA-1), and
set out to learn whether his hunch was true, and if so, why.
</P>
<P>
   One of the people Springer called was a colleague at the
University of Pennsylvania who had heard a talk by a pediatrician
named Donald Anderson. ``In 1982,'' Anderson says, ``I received a
letter from a child's father. The girl was very young, maybe 2 or
3. The letter just said, 'My daughter has all kinds of strange
infections. Would anybody in the state of Texas have any interest
in taking care of her?' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``I called him and did a variety of studies on her. What we
noticed was that her white blood cells lacked the capacity to stick
to surfaces. They would slide right off glass or protein surfaces,
which is very unusual. White blood cells usually stick avidly to
almost everything.'' By 1985, Anderson had located a half dozen
similar patients in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   After Anderson's colleague told Springer about him, the two
began working together. Studying blood samples from Anderson's
patients, they verified that the white blood cells would not clump
together, as normal white blood cells do, thus strongly suggesting
they were missing LFA-1. Further research showed that the protein
was indeed missing.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986 the team published the result: LFA-1's target was
ICAM-1. The discovery launched an entire field of biology dedicated
to the study of cellular adhesion in the immune system.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, Richard Colonno, then a molecular biologist at Merck,
now a vice president of infectious-disease drug discovery at
Bristol-Myers Squibb, showed definitively that 90 percent of all
rhinoviruses used one receptor, and the other 10 percent used
another. It meant 90 percent of half of the common cold viruses
might be stopped with the same drug, which was a large enough
percentage to justify developing a treatment and putting it on the
market.
</P>
<P>
   During the mid-'80s, Colonno and his colleagues produced an
antibody that attacked the receptor and blocked the virus from
getting into the cell and replicating _ at least in a test tube.
But when they tried to come up with a cheap version of the
antibody, they failed.
</P>
<P>
   Colonno's work, however, had spawned competition from the work
of two molecular biologists, Jeffrey Greve and Alan McClelland who
worked for Molecular Therapeutics. McClelland and Greve tried to
nail down the receptor's identity, and succeeded in pinpointing the
gene that coded for the rhinovirus receptor as well as the receptor
itself.
</P>
<P>
   Greve's laboratory purified the protein and sequenced it,
creating a precise map of the string of amino acids that composed
the protein. When researchers in Greve's lab compared their
sequence with those in a computer database of proteins previously
sequenced by other researchers, ICAM-1 matched perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went to the library ... to find out what ICAM-1 was, and
came up Springer's group,'' McClelland says. Springer's ``group''
now included a pair of former researchers _ Robert Rothlein and
Steven Marlin _ who were working at Boehringer Ingleheim.
</P>
<P>
   Once Greve and McClelland realized ICAM-1 was the rhinovirus
receptor, word began to spread. Marlin got a call asking him if
ICAM-1 could be the receptor.
</P>
<P>
   ``In very short order,'' Marlin says, ''we put together concrete
information that ICAM-1 was the receptor to a major group of
rhinoviruses.''
</P>
<P>
   During the next decade BI and Bayer, the company that owns
Molecular Therapeutics, raced to get a cold cure to market first.
Both teams hit on the same strategy. They produced a form of ICAM-1
that was not rooted in the cell walls but was soluble. They could
squirt it into noses in the hope that the rhinovirus would snatch
up the free-floating ICAM-1 and never get around to grabbing the
ICAM-1 receptors that let it into the cells. The strategy is a
''decoy effect,'' Marlin says.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of problems had to be solved first, however. For
instance, your nose produces mucus as a barrier to foreign
particles. Could soluble ICAM-1 survive, or would the mucus break
it down and wash it away before it had the chance to decoy any
rhinovirus?
</P>
<P>
   The researchers also had to prove that the soluble ICAM would
work on all or most of the 90-plus strains of rhinovirus.
Reassuringly, their experiments showed that the virus seemed to
remain susceptible to the ICAM decoys, at least in test tubes.
</P>
<P>
   Whether ICAM is good enough to make a marketable cold treatment
remains to be seen. McClelland, for one, calls it a good shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's the kind of approach that, even if it doesn't
work, will certainly have advanced our understanding quite a bit.
And _ who knows? _ maybe it will work. The common cold has caused
enough problems for us all. It would be nice to have something you
could just take and be done with it.''

percentage to justify developing a treatment and putting it on the
market.
</P>
<P>
   During the mid-'80s, Colonno and his colleagues produced an
antibody that attacked the receptor and blocked the virus from
getting into the cell and replicating _ at least in a test tube.
But when they tried to come up with a cheap version of the
antibody, they failed.
</P>
<P>
   Colonno's work, however, had spawned competition from the work
of two molecular biologists, Jeffrey Greve and Alan McClelland who
worked for Molecular Therapeutics. McClelland and Greve tried to
nail down the receptor's identity, and succeeded in pinpointing the
gene that coded for the rhinovirus receptor as well as the receptor
itself.
</P>
<P>
   Greve's laboratory purified the protein and sequenced it,
creating a precise map of the string of amino acids that composed
the protein. When researchers in Greve's lab compared their
sequence with those in a computer database of proteins previously
sequenced by other researchers, ICAM-1 matched perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went to the library ... to find out what ICAM-1 was, and
came up Springer's group,'' McClelland says. Springer's ``group''
now included a pair of former researchers _ Robert Rothlein and
Steven Marlin _ who were working at Boehringer Ingleheim.
</P>
<P>
   Once Greve and McClelland realized ICAM-1 was the rhinovirus
receptor, word began to spread. Marlin got a call asking him if
ICAM-1 could be the receptor.
</P>
<P>
   ``In very short order,'' Marlin says, ''we put together concrete
information that ICAM-1 was the receptor to a major group of
rhinoviruses.''
</P>
<P>
   During the next decade BI and Bayer, the company that owns
Molecular Therapeutics, raced to get a cold cure to market first.
Both teams hit on the same strategy. They produced a form of ICAM-1
that was not rooted in the cell walls but was soluble. They could
squirt it into noses in the hope that the rhinovirus would snatch
up the free-floating ICAM-1 and never get around to grabbing the
ICAM-1 receptors that let it into the cells. The strategy is a
''decoy effect,'' Marlin says.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of problems had to be solved first, however. For
instance, your nose produces mucus as a barrier to foreign
particles. Could soluble ICAM-1 survive, or would the mucus break
it down and wash it away before it had the chance to decoy any
rhinovirus?
</P>
<P>
   The researchers also had to prove that the soluble ICAM would
work on all or most of the 90-plus strains of rhinovirus.
Reassuringly, their experiments showed that the virus seemed to
remain susceptible to the ICAM decoys, at least in test tubes.
</P>
<P>
   Whether ICAM is good enough to make a marketable cold treatment
remains to be seen. McClelland, for one, calls it a good shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's the kind of approach that, even if it doesn't
work, will certainly have advanced our understanding quite a bit.
And _ who knows? _ maybe it will work. The common cold has caused
enough problems for us all. It would be nice to have something you
could just take and be done with it.''

   &UR; WHAT'S A PINNA FOR? &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The folds of the outer ear _ the pinna _ seem gratuitous, a
waste of cartilage and skin. But they are, some Dutch researchers
have found, crucial to our ability to pinpoint the vertical
location of sounds _ whether they come from above us, below, in
front, or behind. When a sound wave enters the outer ear, it
bounces around the pinna's ridges. Some frequencies are enhanced,
others diminished, with the pattern of those changes determined by
the particular shape of the pinna. Since everyone's pinnae are
different, so is the acoustic stamp placed on sound entering the
brain.
</P>
<P>
   Biophysicist John van Opstal, who works at the University of
Nijmegen in The Netherlands, and his colleagues placed plastic
molds inside their own ears (and those of a student) to alter the
shape of their pinnae and wore them day and night for six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The new ``earprint,'' Van Opstal surmised, would have to be
learned by the brain if he and his colleagues were to retain their
normal hearing. (The brain determines horizontal distance to a
sound's source by measuring the differences between the two ears in
the arrival time and loudness of the sound waves.) Initially, in
tests in a darkened laboratory, none of the subjects could
determine the vertical source of a sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you position the source of a sound at many random locations
_ up and to the right, down and to the left _ the subject thinks
that the sound is moving only in the horizontal direction and not
at all in the vertical,'' Van Opstal says. But after four or five
days, three of the subjects began to regain their normal hearing.
(The fourth took almost three weeks.)
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the hearing of all four returned to normal, and
remained so when they took out the molds, which suggests that the
brain can learn and retain many auditory maps. Interestingly, the
subjects noticed no difference in their hearing during the
experiment while they were outside the lab, even at the beginning
of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the reason is that our visual system tells us where a
sound is coming from, although our auditory system tells us
something different,'' Van Opstal says. ``So the visual system is
the driving force that trains the auditory system, by correlating
what is seen with what is heard.''

 &UR; CRANE SURGEON &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Eduard, a rare Siberian crane, suffered from severe arthritis
for five years. In the wild, Siberian cranes stand on soft, mushy
marshland. In zoos, however, where the birds typically live on hard
surfaces, arthritis is not uncommon.
</P>
<P>
   Since neither painkillers nor anti-inflammatory medication could
ease Eduard's pain, surgeons recently implanted an artificial joint
in his left ankle. The procedure, never tried on a bird, was
performed by Avery Bennett, an assistant professor of wildlife and
zoological medicine at the University of Florida, and Eugene
O'Brien, a hand surgeon with the Hand Center in San Antonio, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   In a four-hour operation at the University of Florida Veterinary
Medical Teaching Hospital, the surgeons replaced part of the ankle
joint with a flexible plastic device about the size of a
clothespin, normally used as an artificial joint in the big toes of
humans. Eduard is now recovering nicely, say his keepers.
</P>
<P>
   While the bird's surgery may be used to help other arthritic
cranes, younger, healthy captive birds need preventive care. The
International Crane Foundation in Baraboo, Wis., Eduard's home,
plans to build shallow, soft wetland environments to better
accommodate its 17 Siberian cranes.

 &UR; HOW TO GROW BONES FROM SCRATCH &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When surgeons need to graft bone _ for, say, reconstructing
someone's face after an accident _ they dig it out of another part
of the patient's body, usually the pelvis. ``It's a painful
operation,'' says John Davies, a dentist and biomedical engineer at
the University of Toronto. ``And because the patient must undergo
essentially two operations, he has to stay on the operating table
for a longer time. That's more costly and means a longer recovery
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Davies and his colleagues have found a way to avoid that first,
bone-harvesting operation. They've developed a polymer scaffold
that mimics the structure of real bone. In particular, it's
designed to work like trabecular bone _ the spongy bone beneath the
skeleton's hard outer shell. Like trabecular bone, the matrix has
countless interconnected pores, each about a millimeter in size.
Nestled within those pores are both osteoclasts (bone-eating cells)
and osteoblasts (bone-making cells). When the synthetic bone is
transplanted, those cells spread and grow new bone, healing the
injury.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have tried to seed bones onto a scaffold before,
Davies says, but with little luck. Some groups tried a matrix of
calcium phosphate _ the mineral that makes up coral. ``It works
extremely well when it comes to growing cells, but when it's put in
the body it's not absorbed. It just stays there. So that's not a
very good long-term strategy,'' he says. Other researchers have
tried biodegradable foams, but the pores in the foam are so small
that bone cells can't penetrate them.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they make bone, it's only as a shell formed on the
surface,'' Davies adds. By tinkering with two manufacturing
processes commonly used to make biodegradable foams, Davies has
made a foam that has much larger pores _ about the same size as the
pores in real spongy bone. ``When we seed the scaffold with cells,
the cells grow right through and penetrate to a depth of up to
about half an inch, so they make bone in a three-dimensional
configuration,'' he says. ``We haven't gone any deeper than that,
and we don't plan to, because when surgeons remove bone for
grafting, they only chip out tiny bits of bone, and we are trying
to create an alternative.'' Davies plans to test the synthetic bone
in simple dental surgeries within a year.

   1. Using a large, room-temperature carrot, pare the carrot to
make five flat sides. This takes about three swipes with the peeler
on each face. Place the knife at one rib and cut down at a 45
degree angle to the center of the carrot. Turn and make the same
cut at the next rib. Be sure to begin each cut at the same level,
as though there were a band around the carrot.
</P>
<P>
   2. When the cuts have been made at all five ribs, hold the
carrot in both hands and twist the end. It should come off as a
five-pointed flower. Continue up the carrot at -inch intervals to
make more flowers.
</P>
<P>
   The carrot flowers can be stored in water in the refrigerator
for as long as five days. Use to garnish salads.

   S o you're no good at eye-balling the thickness of a steak or
fish fillet, which is a basic guideline to cooking times. There's
no need to haul out a ruler. All you need is your index finger. As
a rule, the measurement from the tip to the first joint on an adult
is to 1 inch. Measure yours once. Then all you have to do is point
your index finger at the counter alongside the food and you'll know
how thick it is.

 &HT;    Stylized offerings are several cuts above the norm
 &HT;    By Ann Heller
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Paula Sideras is a Dayton caterer known for her
pretty garnishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very important to me. I never send a plate out
ungarnished,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Her tomato roses and other vegetable flowers draw sounds of
appreciation from party-goers whose usual idea of a garnish is a
sprig of parsley.
</P>
<P>
   How difficult is it for a home cook to duplicate those artful
radish chrysanthemums and Aztec mushrooms?
</P>
<P>
   To find out, I followed her lead while a photographer took
pictures of Sideras performing skills she has honed since she
graduated from the Cincinnati Culinary Arts Academy in the early
'80s.
</P>
<P>
   First, let me say that I'm a home cook who's comfortable when
all four burners are on high, but I don't have any tolerance for
tedious procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the teacher convinced me, by example, that at least some
of these garnishes are easy _ and quick. I managed to turn out
three credible vegetable flowers the first time around .
</P>
<P>
   Credible _ not perfect. Sideras' hands move with graceful
precision. She holds a carrot like a delicate bird. I tend to
clutch it tightly and she suggests a change in position.
</P>
<P>
   ``If your knife slips you'll cut your wrist,'' she warns. I move
the carrot to a less threatening distance.
</P>
<P>
   And when I make the cuts as suggested, the carrot flower twists
out neatly.
</P>
<P>
   No special tools are needed for this art, just a cutting board,
a sharp paring knife, a swivel peeler and chopsticks. The
chopsticks are used as a knife guide while making the chrysanthemum
radish.
</P>
<P>
   The peeler is used to pare a carrot into a five-sided vegetable
(six-sided is acceptable, Sideras said, when she noticed my slight
mistake).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not necessarily bad,'' she said, obviously in the role of
an encouraging teacher. ``It just won't be the same flower.''
</P>
<P>
   Only a knife is needed for the tomato rose and Aztec mushroom,
and the rose turns out to be surprisingly easy to create. Peeled
just the way we peeled apples at Halloween _ into one long peel _
it is simply wrapped and flipped, and voila, there's a rose.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I teach class I do this and people always say `Oooooh!'
'' Sideras says.
</P>
<P>
   Only the Aztec mushroom seems to take more practice _ plus a bit
of luck and a disposition toward precision.
</P>
<P>
   QUICKTIP
</P>
<P>
   Before starting, always place a damp towel under the cutting
board so it doesn't slip while you work.

center for colorful effect. Cut a slice off the root end to make a
flat base. Put the radish between chopsticks so the knife doesn't
cut all the way through. Make cuts -inch thick across the radish
and take care at both ends not to slice completely through. If cuts
are too shallow the radish won't ``bloom''.
</P>
<P>
   2. Turn the radish and cut a grid across the radish slices,
again cutting through to the chopsticks. Soak the radishes in cold
water in the refrigerator overnight so they open to resemble a
flower.
</P>
<P>
   3. Garnish the radish mums with radish leaves, which are edible.
They are pretty on relish and sandwich trays.

 &HT;    Autograph seekers will love these teams
 &HT;    By Sean McClelland
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Mention the name Kellen Winslow to football fans
of a certain age and a clear image leaps to mind of this player,
completely spent, white towel draped over his head, being assisted
from the field by two teammates. He had just driven the San Diego
Chargers past the Miami Dolphins, seemingly with every fiber of his
existence.
</P>
<P>
   Nary a day passes when he isn't reminded of that Jan. 2, 1982
overtime playoff game. ``Good thing we won,'' laughed Winslow, who
played nine years as a tight end for the Chargers and entered the
Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, in his role as commissioner of the Indoor Foortball
League, Winslow helped the Dayton Skyhawks, newest of eight IFL
franchises, drum up interest for their inaugural 12-game season
beginning April 2 at Hara Arena against Green Bay.
</P>
<P>
   It's a far cry from the NFL and Winslow admits he didn't know
quite what to think when approached about the job. But now he's
thinking about further expansion _ to 12 or 16 teams by next year _
and says a cable TV deal for the league is possible, in part
because ``networks are in dire need of programming.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a market for it,'' Winslow said prior to a spirited
press conference at the Doubletree Hotel in downtown Dayton. ``This
is just the beginning. Eventually, we can manage 20 teams and still
have a great product. They've really thought this thing through,
right down to the last nickel.''
</P>
<P>
   Sole IFL owner Keary Euckland is taking pains to keep costs
down. Teams travel by bus only _ Winslow jokes that he's the only
one allowed to fly, only because he lives in San Diego _ and
players make $200 per game, which means they all hold full-time
jobs. ``It's a grueling schedule for them,'' Winslow said, ``but
really no more demanding than college. They're just working rather
than taking classes.''
</P>
<P>
   Accompanying Winslow on the dais were Skyhawks general manager
Walter Briggs and head coach Earnest Wilson, who used his time _
and then some _ to describe the backgrounds and aspirations of
nearly the entire 44-man training camp roster. Handed a note
telling him to wrap it up, Wilson crumpled it into a ball and
tossed a short pass _ symbolic of his desire to put the players
first. ``Anytime I can talk about my players, I will,'' Wilson
said. ``That's what it's all about. We're going to be good. That's
all I can say.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the players have local ties, including quarterback Eric
Boykin. The former Meadowdale High star is a likely starter, as is
6-foot-1, 315-pound fullback William Houston, a Trotwood-Madison
grad who played at Ohio State and briefly with the Indianapolis
Colts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our team is going to be so community based, you will not
believe it,'' Briggs promised. ``Our players won't leave the field
_ and this is a league rule _ until every autograph is signed. No
one here is Michael Jordan.''.
</P>
<P>
   Winslow, a late bloomer who played only one year of high school
football, said he encourages players to be realistic while not
losing touch with their dreams. For some, the IFL can be a path to
the NFL. For many, it will be a hobby.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone finds a level,'' said Winslow, who has stayed close
to football as a broadcaster in recent years. ``The lucky ones, one
or two, will get a chance to move up _ if they have the ability.
Meanwhile, we're giving them a chance to continue playing a game
they love.''

 &HT;    TOMATO ROSE
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   1. Use a small paring knife to make a quarter-sized cut across
the bottom, but do not cut completely through. Begin to peel the
tomato in a -inch-wide strip, cutting slowly in a continuous
circular fashion. It's important to keep the knife as close to the
surface as possible without cutting through. If you take too much
flesh it won't be as delicate a flower. Use the thumb of your other
hand, positioned on the peel as a guide, and you can feel if the
knife is going to come through. If the peel breaks, just continue
on. The break is easy to disguise. When all the peel is removed,
cut it away from the tomato.
</P>
<P>
   2. Lay out the long spiral of peel and grab the tail. The rose
is created by wrapping the peel in reverse order, flesh side in.
Form a little cone and wrap in a fairly tight circle. If the peel
is in two pieces, just overlap a half inch and continue. Place the
quarter-size piece on top. Grasp the rose in both hands and flip it
over.
</P>
<P>
   3. The finished rose can be used to garnish antipasto platters,
plates of sliced tomatoes, bread salad _ any dish that incorporates
tomatoes. In summer, use red, yellow and pink tomatoes for a
colorful bouquet. Basil or fresh bay leaves add a finishing touch.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti _ For the life of Remy Felix, he just
can't shake the so-called ``pig story.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many other poor Haitians, Felix -- who lives in the
sprawling slum of Cite Soleil --still bitterly recalls how the
United States, alarmed by an outbreak of African swine fever in the
early 1980s, persuaded the Haitian government to slaughter every
pig in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Felix said the resulting economic fiasco did little to endear
the United States to many Haitian farmers. Sadly, it is also
indicative of how the U.S. Agency for International Development
(USAID), which administers foreign aid programs for the U.S. State
Department, has sometimes miscalculated here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those people tried to destroy Haiti,'' Felix said angrily. ``I
remember my family suffering much.''
</P>
<P>
   The story goes like this: Nearly 20 years ago, Haiti officials
had between 300,000 and 400,000 pigs destroyed after U.S.
scientists detected swine fever in Haitian black Creole pigs. By
the late 1970s, hundreds of thousands had already died of swine
fever -- a fatal and highly contagious disease that causes internal
hemorrhaging in the animals -- and fears erupted that it might
spread throughout the hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   By 1984, after the U.S.-supported slaughter, the country was
declared free of the fever. That is when USAID implemented a
controversial plan to spend $5.8 million to replace the black pigs
with white pigs from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   USAID officials argued that the pigs would grow larger, and that
their meat could be exported. What's more, farmers were generally
reimbursed for their loss when a pig was slaughtered and should
look at the new imports as an opportunity to boost their income.
</P>
<P>
   It sounded feasible, and even desirable. Traditionally, pigs had
been an important economic mainstay here. So much so that Haitians
used the same word for both ``pig'' and ``bank.''
</P>
<P>
   But when the new American pigs were shipped in, the farmers
found that they needed a wheat-based, vitamin-enriched feed that
farmers could ill-afford. Also, many of the pigs couldn't survive
the heat. As a result, many of the farmers suffered major economic
losses.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the Haitian government had to import the tougher,
better-adaptable black pigs from Jamaica and other parts of the
Caribbean to replace the depleted population.
</P>
<P>
   ``Haitians politicized this issue, saying we were trying to kill
all their pigs, but actually the farmers were paid quite well,''
said Ernest Preeg, U.S. ambassador to Haiti from 1981 to 1983.
</P>
<P>
   As for the American ``bourgeois pigs,'' as the Haitians called
them, the farmers did get some use out of them. They often served
them up as dinner.

   GANGS.COM _ As if drive-bys and turf wars weren't enough, street
gangs are now flashing their colors and flourishing on the
internet. Websites for the Bloods, Crips, and Folkes have been
popping up with the history of their sets, streaming video pictures
of their members and listings of their favorite guns. We talk to
the webmaster who is responsible for designing many of these sites
and to the police to find out if these gang banging web surfers are

   COXNET FOOD _ If you don't have a jar of cumin nestled between
the salt and pepper, you are definitely out of step with the times.
Sales of cumin skyrocketed 62 percent between 1995 and 1997,
according to McCormick &AMP; Co., the country's major spice purveyor.
That makes it the fastest-growing spice in this country, outpacing
other spices, which grew a more modest 17 percent. (Heller, Dayton

   CYBERSPICE _ There is such a wealth of knowledge about herbs and
spices that one could make a lifetime study of these fascinating
plants. And for eons, people have done just that. In ancient times
in many societies, knowledge of herbs and their uses both in
medicine and in cooking set a person apart as a wise and valued
member of the group. Today, these people are on the Internet. There
are many hundreds of excellent sites where individuals, herb
societies and educational institutions share their collected

Peppers, the sweet, slightly piquant beak-shaped peppers from the

   AFFIRMATIVE-ACTION (San Francisco) _ As San Francisco moves
warily away from using racial preferences in school admissions,

AIRLINES GIVE UPSTATE NEW YORK ROUGH RIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The last time I flew out of Albany International
Airport, the flight attendants went through this big production in
the front of the plane. They were showing us how to put on those
little orange cups _ the ones supposedly attached to oxygen tanks
somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I don't think those little masks are there to
deliver oxygen. If you fly in and out of anywhere in upstate New
York, the masks are really there to muffle your howls of agony over
how much you had to pay for your ticket.
</P>
<P>
   The fares are shocking, outrageous, disgraceful, appalling,
dismaying and ... and ... well, they're just too high _ to the
point of criminality.
</P>
<P>
   I'm worked up over this because, for a few years now, I've been
paying to fly a kid back and forth to college in Colorado. My least
favorite spot on this planet is Newark Airport in New Jersey. But
that's where the kid comes in and out of. If we flew him in and out
of Albany International, then we couldn't afford to pay his tuition
to go to school in Colorado in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   But, to save 400 bucks each way? For that kind of money, we
would fly him in and out of Calcutta, which isn't all that
different from Newark, by the way, although it does lack the
glamour. The fact is that every study on this, and there have been
a number of them, shows that upstate New York air fares are
completely out of sight. They are stratospheric _ among the highest
in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The airlines view service to and from this part of the country _
and to everything in the Midwest that isn't Detroit or Chicago, by
the way _ as profit lines. This is where the airlines squeeze out
the bucks. This isn't just about how much it costs me to fly my kid
back and forth to college, although, might I add, that is a matter
of monumental consequence. It's really about jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses need reasonable air fares. Lacking them, they have
one more reason to head somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   Given how expensive it is to do business in the Empire State
anyway, and how rotten the upstate New York economy remains despite
the national boom, why do New York politicians permit this to go
on? Well, supposedly, this will be the year that Congress and the
state Legislature will tackle the issue of how astonishingly
expensive it is to fly in any out of upstate New York airports.
</P>
<P>
   The state's congressional delegation is pressuring President
Clinton's Transportation Department to approve more frequent
low-fare flights for this region. Sen. Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y.,
is pushing for airline deregulation at four major airports that are
regular destinations for Albany fliers. The idea is to effectively
reduce fares from here to there.
</P>
<P>
   State Senate Majority Leader Joe Bruno has established a task
force to find a way to lower upstate air fares. And Assembly
Speaker Shelly Silver has put together his own air fare committee.
So, wonderful, now we have pleading letters to the Clinton
administration _ which will be on a huge, celebratory drunk for the
next two years after winning this impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   And now we have committees. I feel so reassured.
</P>
<P>
   The one sure way out of this is creation of an Upstate New York
Airport Authority to supplant the little local authorities in
Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse and Albany _ a monster authority
serving 6 million New Yorkers to give upstate the air passenger
clout to force reasonable fares out of the airlines.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is that upstate New York contains more people than all
of Massachusetts, but Logan Airport in Boston has decent fares
because its negotiating efforts are not fragmented as they are in
upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, sure, local control is a wonderful thing. Yeah, OK,
patronage is the American way. But this is serious business. These
politicians are killing upstate New York economically with this
stuff, just killing us.
</P>
<P>
   And then stifling our screams with those little orange cups.

DOW MILESTONE HAS RIPPLE EFFECTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JO-ANN JOHNSTON  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ So much waiting and hoping, and all over a
number.
</P>
<P>
   What does the Dow crossing the 10,000 mark _ even if only for a
minute _ mean to most Americans far away from Wall Street? It
probably means the most to consumer confidence in the health of the
overall economy, which in itself is an important influence on the
business world, observers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These types of things have a ripple effect, even as far away
as Lark Street,'' John Samatulski, the new director of the Lark
Street business improvement district, said Tuesday shortly after
the Dow Jones industrial average topped 10,000 for the first time,
then fell back. People are more willing to shop and dine out if
they feel the economy is robust, which is how they interpret such
bullishness on Wall Street, Samatulski said.
</P>
<P>
   The 10,000 mark is strictly a ``psychological barrier,'' but an
important one, said Hany Shawky, who heads the finance department
at the State University of New York at Albany.
</P>
<P>
   ``It tells people that this crazy market is OK and is going to
keep going up,'' Shawky said.
</P>
<P>
   To some people, that's shorthand for: it's safe to spend more
money, Shawky said. That's because the Dow would not have risen if
it were not for the combined effects of influences such as low
inflation, low unemployment, an improved economic climate with U.S.
trading partners _ bits of good economic data that, on their own,
lack the sizzle and the hype of the Dow.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the rosy fortunes of a limited number of big stocks on
the New York Exchange do not reflect the much broader picture,
noted Edward LaVarnway, director of investment strategy at First
Albany Corp. Two-thirds of the stocks in the broader Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index have declined in value recently, he said.
</P>
<P>
   So there is no sense in assuming that just because the Dow hit
10,000 _ briefly _ this is a good time to buy any stocks, he said.
Investment decisions should still be guided by long-term goals and
a person's age, he said.
</P>
<P>
   And the optimistic Shawky agreed that some of the brighter
stocks are too expensive to consider buying now because of inflated
prices.
</P>
<P>
   The price-inflation factor creates another psychological impact:
fear. Analysts who quite soberly point out that the difference
between 9,900 and 10,000 is, in reality, negligible are worried
that the market and the Dow index are overhyped. And that could
lead to a disappointing fall in stock values of 20 to 30 percent,
said Mark Arbeter, a technical analyst with Standard &AMP; Poor's
Personal Wealth publication.
</P>
<P>
   Alternately, the market might just ``go sideways'' for the next
six to 12 months, which would also be disappointing to investors
who had come to expect big returns from now on, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Corporations aren't likely to increase their capital spending on
plants or equipment just because of the Dow hitting 10,000, Shawky
said. ``The companies are more realistic,'' he said.

 &HT;    JOURNAL: SOME THINGS STILL WORK, EVEN IF RUSSIA DOESN'T
 &HT;    With Photo Mug of Holmes.
 &HT;    Moving in both the International and Commentary categories.
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Since the economy crashed and burned last August, it
has not been easy to find good news to report from Russia's
capital.
</P>
<P>
   But as winter delivers its last punches in the next few weeks,
now let us praise a few things that -- well, let's be blunt here --
that actually WORK WELL in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Operating in a market economy may give Russians a fit, but
operating in a blizzard is ``byez problemah'' -- without a care.
Russia has to struggle to find its way in the post-Cold War world;
there is no such identity crisis in the everyday routine of coping
with winter.
</P>
<P>
   Armies of snow removal trucks deploy on the roads day and night
to clean the streets while the extensive Moscow subway system
handles millions of riders a day.
</P>
<P>
   And the centralized heating system works so well that on some
winter days it may be sub-zero outside while it is
shorts-and-t-shirt weather inside your apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the United States, where snowstorms are tracked by armies
of meteorologists and television bulletins offering alarming
updates of snowfall amounts and school closings, there is no such
panic in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the weather rarely makes the news here. Beginning in
late October or early November, the weather outlook goes something
like this: Today, it is definitely going to be cold and will
probably snow. Tomorrow, ditto. And on and on until April.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the good news: This city of 12 million is never really
paralyzed by winter. Sure, urban traffic crawls, as it does most
all the time, summer or winter. But snowfall rarely brings school
closings and flight delays.
</P>
<P>
   History attests to Russia's proficiency at dealing with winter.
It helped Moscow repel the armies of Napoleon and Hitler. Winter is
an old friend, the subject of affection and only a few complaints.
It never keeps a Russian from getting to work, school, the
unemployment office.
</P>
<P>
   This harmony with winter is as old as Russia itself and an
integral part of the national character. But the systems in Moscow
for coping are thanks in large part to Soviets.
</P>
<P>
   The 1917 Bolshevik Revolution and the Communist regimes that
followed industrialized what had been a country of peasant farmers.
Many of these new factory workers came to live in the cities. And
happy workers needed a way to get to work, and a warm apartment at
the end of the day.
</P>
<P>
   The Soviets built an impressive, efficient subway system and a
network of central heating stations that provide hot water and
steam heat to every apartment building.
</P>
<P>
   They also made sure the roads were clean, for the party
hierarchy zipping around in their black limousines -- and also for
the bread trucks to make their deliveries to keep those workers
happy.
</P>
<P>
   All these systems still work today, heavily subsidized by the
local and federal governments. Then, as now, they remain important
to maintaining the social order in difficult times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our budget is bad,'' explained Gennady Krapivny, a senior city
official, ``but we keep everything normal.''
</P>
<P>
   This winter, it has snowed more days than not. Every 24 hours,
more than 6,800 snowplows, trucks and other machines are operated
by more than 15,000 workers to remove snow from Moscow streets.
</P>
<P>
   There are also about 40,000 men and women under the direction of
local councils who are given shovels and dispatched to clear
streets, sidewalks and trolley-bus rails. Between Nov. 1 and April
15, the city will have spread nearly 300,000 tons of salt on the
icy streets and moved mountains of snow, which it trucks away to
deposit in the Moscow River.
</P>
<P>
   Today, there are 2.5 million cars in Moscow, a more than 10-fold
increase in 10 years. But of course, most people in this city are
not driving to work. Nine million people a day are riding the
subway.
</P>
<P>
   The people in charge of the Moscow Metro, its 160 stations and
163 miles of track, view their system as the lifeblood of the city.
</P>
<P>
   The Bolsheviks directed metro builders to remove ornate tiles
and artwork from the homes of the imperial-era upper classes to
decorate the ``people's houses'' -- the subway stations. They
remain places of grandeur, and a one-way fare remains at a level
the proletariat would like -- about 17 cents.
</P>
<P>
   The system is rundown and operates at a huge deficit, but
between 6 a.m. and 1 a.m., it remains the swiftest and most
reliable way around the city.
</P>
<P>
   Even if, after the economic crisis last August, more Muscovites
today have no job to go to.

   MOSCOW _ Since the economy crashed and burned last August, it
has not been easy to find good news to report from Russia's
capital.
</P>
<P>
   But as winter delivers its last punches in the next few weeks,
now let us praise a few things that -- well, let's be blunt here --
that actually WORK WELL in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Operating in a market economy may give Russians a fit, but
operating in a blizzard is ``byez problemah'' -- without a care.
Russia has to struggle to find its way in the post-Cold War world;
there is no such identity crisis in the everyday routine of coping
with winter.
</P>
<P>
   Armies of snow removal trucks deploy on the roads day and night
to clean the streets while the extensive Moscow subway system
handles millions of riders a day.
</P>
<P>

winter days it may be sub-zero outside while it is
shorts-and-t-shirt weather inside your apartment.

CHINESE-AMERICANS BECOME A SCAPEGOAT ... AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM WONG  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ A few years ago, I was invited to the Los
Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico to speak about Asian
Pacific American Heritage Month.
</P>
<P>
   The event was low-key. About two dozen lab employees showed up,
most of them of Chinese or Asian descent. My speech and more
informal conversations were about the history and growth of the
Asian-American community.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know whether Wen Ho Lee was in the audience. I do know
that there was no discussion about whether Chinese-American
scientists at the lab could be spies for China. Now there is a
chorus singing that tune out of Washington, D.C., and the music
sends chills through many Chinese-Americans, especially those in
sensitive technology-related jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, a computer scientist at the Los Alamos lab that developed
nuclear weapons technology, was very publicly dismissed recently.
He is suspected of surreptitiously passing along technological
information that has helped China advance its missile capabilities,
although he has not been arrested nor charged with a crime. His
dismissal casts a long shadow over his loyalties _ and perhaps
those of other Chinese-American scientists.
</P>
<P>
   The Lee case is the latest wrinkle in what seems to be an
enduring international serial melodrama featuring the United States
and China. It is about whether the world's most powerful nation and
the world's most populous nation are friends, allies, partners,
rivals or enemies, or some combination of all those labels.
</P>
<P>
   While the two countries have had more or less normal relations
for more than 20 years now, some Americans are clearly irritated,
if not downright hostile, about continuing dealings with the rising
force of Asia.
</P>
<P>
   They complain about China's human rights record. They accuse
China of trying to influence U.S. politics with illegal campaign
contributions (while ignoring U.S. interventions in the domestic
politics of numerous nations). Now they are screaming about China
stealing U.S. technology. But more sober analysts say China is
still decades behind the United States in nuclear weapons
development and really poses no genuine threat at this time.
</P>
<P>
   It is also not at all clear whether China used stolen U.S.
technology to make recent missile advances.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese scientists could have developed such technology on their
own or gotten help from the Russians, or _ in this post-Cold-War
era _ simply acquired it through open international exchanges among
scientists from many different nations.
</P>
<P>
   When one is so publicly fired from a sensitive job, as Wen Ho
Lee was, the tendency is to assume he is guilty. The fact that the
FBI has not yet arrested and charged him with any crime after
several years of investigation means we ought to withhold judgment
on whether Lee, who was born on Taiwan, is a Chinese spy.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his colleagues contend he couldn't have done what he is
suspected of doing. Nonetheless, prominent Republicans and the
Washington media elite have all but convicted Lee. In a rational
world, one would not assume scientists of the same or similar
background might also be disloyal. But Chinese-Americans have good
reasons to feel insecure when such explosive allegations roar out
of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Some remember the exclusion era that began in the 19th century,
a time when ethnic Chinese found it virtually impossible _ because
of race _ to settle in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Others _ more recent arrivals _ feel the push-pull of dual
identities and loyalties, a dilemma not helped by subtle
institutional racism that blocks their progress despite excellent
credentials, qualifications and experience, to say nothing of
demonstrated loyalty to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   It could very well be that the Lee case will turn into a serious
breach of national security. But it really has the smell of
political and possibly racial hysteria, almost an annual rite of
spring but not nearly as affirming as the blossoming of daffodils.

INTERNET EVENS THE PLAYING FIELD IN ENVIRONMENTAL BATTLES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By EUNICE MOSCOSO  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ They have maps, cartoons, news articles, search
engines and more links than a chain fence. With elaborate Internet
sites, environmental groups have gained a public relations
advantage over the better-funded farm industry.
</P>
<P>
   Basic information about harmful pesticides and about water
pollution from livestock, poultry and dairy farming are available
on the Web sites of groups such as the Sierra Club and the Natural
Resources Defense Council.
</P>
<P>
   But the environmentalists are using the diverse powers of the
Internet to grab attention in other ways:
</P>
<P>
   _ Users can click on a U.S. map and get specific information
about animal waste problems in their state and county.
</P>
<P>
   _ They can e-mail pre-written letters to the Environmental
Protection Agency and the U.S. Department of Agriculture urging
tougher regulations.
</P>
<P>
   _ They can listen to recorded ``citizen's stories'' about the
horrors of living near a large livestock farm.
</P>
<P>
   _ They can link to reports tying animal waste to the toxin
Pfiesteria, which has killed thousands of fish on the East Coast.
</P>
<P>
   _ With the North Carolina Environmental Defense Fund's ``poop
counter,'' they can even get an up-to-the-second estimate of how
much manure has been produced by North Carolina's 10 million hogs.
</P>
<P>
   Senior attorney Daniel Whittle said the Web page lets the North
Carolina group counter the millions of dollars spent by hog farmers
on lobbying and in advertising against candidates who favor more
regulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Environmental groups just cannot match the resources the
industry has,'' he said, ``so we saw the Web as an ideal tool to
get people informed.''
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups are heavily linked on the Internet.
National groups have links to each other and to state groups which
have links to local grassroots organizations.
</P>
<P>
   In response to increasing attacks from environmental groups, the
National Pork Producers Council has devoted space on its Web site
to proving that pork farmers and producers are good stewards of the
environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``When somebody is contending that something is true and it
isn't ... we try to correct it in any way we can _ that's one
way,'' said Steven Cohen, spokesman for the 85,000-member group.
</P>
<P>
   The site includes detailed answers to charges from environmental
groups, followed by extensive citations of research studies.
</P>
<P>
   Some other livestock groups, however, have not been so quick to
use the Internet for such serious issues.
</P>
<P>
   The Web pages for the National Broiler Council, which represents
most of the nation's chicken farmers and producers, carries lighter
fare. It teaches how to reinvent classic chicken recipes, how to
handle poultry safely, and how Vitamin B in chicken is good for the
heart.
</P>
<P>
   The pages for the National Turkey Federation, which represents
about 95 percent of the nation's turkey farmers and producers, are
similar. The main page features a ``Chef of the Month'' and leads
to 12 links about ``Cooking with Turkey'' and 15 on ``Culinary
Trends.''
</P>
<P>
   Some farm associations, such as the Texas Farm Bureau, have
``legislative updates'' on their sites, along with information on
crop insurance and market trends. But most state farm bureau sites,
which are rarely linked to each other, are dedicated to member
services and education programs.

AMERICA ONLINE GROWING UP _ AND OUT
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  With COX-AOL-GRAPHICS-0314 
By MARY BETH REGAN  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DULLES, Va. America Online President Stephen M. Case was piecing
together a struggling online company in 1994 when he heard of a hot
new Internet startup, Netscape Communications. He desperately
wanted to buy that company.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, he's had to wait five years to do so.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, (March 17) Netscape shareholders are expected to
approve the sale of their company to AOL in a stock deal worth more
than $8 billion. If the deal is also cleared by the Justice
Department, it would catapult AOL into new business markets and
solidify its position as a major player in online advertising and
electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``This industry is like looking at a 17th century geopolitical
map of Europe,'' says James Kimsey, AOL's founder and former
chairman, and now head of its non-profit foundation. ``Everyone is
trying to marry off his daughter to strengthen alliances. There's
no doubt Netscape is a key strategic play for us.''
</P>
<P>
   AOL is the nation's largest online service, with 16 million
members. Netscape's Netcenter is one of the most frequently visited
Internet sites. Once the companies are combined, AOL can use
Netscape's Internet browser to lessen its reliance on Microsoft,
whose Windows operating system is one route to AOL. The deal also
should help the consumer-focused AOL atpipe we use,'' says Kimsey.
</P>
<P>
   AOL's anywhere, any way strategy is aimed at developing an
online media company whose services that can be accessed from
devices ranging from computers to cell phones to pagers.
</P>
<P>
   ``AOL could even be on your electric toothbrush one day,'' jokes
Matt Korn, the company's senior vice president of network
operations.
</P>
<P>
   That strategy could be key to holding onto AOL's dominant online
position, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today there are any number of ways to access the Internet
--phone lines, cable lines, ADSL lines and wireless,'' says Bill
Whyman, an Internet analyst with Legg Mason Research Technology
Team in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``The value is who controls the customer relationship,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   The man behind AOL's drive to build that needed loyalty is Case.
When Case joined AOL's predecessor, Quantum Computer Service, in
1983, he was 24 and the company was nothing more than a
cyber-experiment. Since then, he has guided the company through a
handful of near-death experiences _ including an uproar created by
subscribers frustrated over troubles connecting to AOL _ and more
recently to better-than-expected financial results.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1994, fiscal-year revenue has climbed to $2.16 billion
from $98 million, and earnings per share to a split-adjusted 14
cents a share from less than 1 cent per share. Wall Street expects
revenue for the fiscal year that ends in June to hit $3.9-$4
billion, and earnings of about 33 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   The company also is growing overseas. AOL International now
operates in the United Kingdom, Germany, Switzerland, Canada, Japan
and Australia. It will launch AOL Hong Kong this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The international markets are like watching the U.S. market on
fast-forward,'' says Jack Davies, president of AOL International.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts attribute AOL's success to a handful of key decisions.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Case started mass-mailing 250 million free AOL disks to
the public. A risky move, it has been credited as helping make AOL
one of the best known consumer brands in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, he changed the pricing structure from a per-minute
charge to a flat fee. Today the service costs $21.95 monthly. As a
result, members are staying online longer-- up from an average of
14 minutes online per day then to an average of 55 minutes daily
now.
</P>
<P>
   The same year, there iness decisions. The company has responded
by has increasing its lobbying force from two to five people. And
it is in the process of setting up its first political action
committee to give money to candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The company also has been instrumental in setting up the Open
Net Coalition, staffed by Vice President Al Gore's former
technology staffer, Greg Simon, and former National Republican
Committee chairman Rich Bond, to lobby for government intervention
in the cable wars. AOL and others, including MindSpring
Enterprises, want regulators to force cable companies to make their
lines available to competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what's really going on here is that they are trying to
slow down the deployment of broadband technology because they are
not in a position to dominate that market,'' says James Cicconi,
AT&AMP;T's general counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Ulric Weil, managing partner of the Arlington-based Friedman,
Billings, Ramsey brokerage firm isn't concerned AOL will be left
behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``AOL will do a deal when they have to,'' he says. ``AOL
wouldn't even get out of bed for the numbers these cable companies
have.''

   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ Battle for control of the future of computing
is looming between the personal computer industry and consumer
electronics manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Its roots can be found in meetings like one held here in July
1995, shortly after Nobuyuki Idei became chief executive of the
Sony Corp. Briefing Idei on the importance of the Internet, Peter
Sealey, a Sony consultant, noted that the year before, the dollar
volume of PC sales had surpassed that of television sales in the
United States for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``He stopped the meeting and challenged my data,'' Sealey
recalled. ``I think it was a shock to him that this had happened.''
</P>
<P>
   But if Idei's education about the rapidly expanding world of
personal computing was abrupt, Sony's conversion to a digital
products strategy has been complete.
</P>
<P>
   For decades the world's pre-eminent consumer electronics maker,
Sony has now realized that its core business is being profoundly
transformed by digital electronics, in ways that pose both
opportunities and threats.
</P>
<P>
   In a huge strategic shift for a company that long relied on the
elegance of its industrial design and the prestige of its brand
name, Sony has come to recognize, its executives say, that a new
era is arriving in which clever software, above all else, will
determine whether products from televisions to telephones will
succeed or fail in the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   That sets the stage for a grand confrontation. On one side are
Sony and its peers in the consumer electronics business. On the
other is the personal computer industry.
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft Corp. and the Intel Corp., the twin engines of the
PC world, are eagerly looking for new markets in which to expand.
Beginning with the cable set-top box in the living room _ a box
they believe will bring the power of the Internet to tens of
millions of TV viewers who do not now use computers _they have a
vast range of Windows-based products on the drawing board,
including toys, phones, even computers for the car that will do
everything from read aloud your to help you with navigation.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's strategy is to re-create the powerful business model
of the personal computer industry in consumer electronics.
</P>
<P>
   At the center would be Windows CE, a scaled-down version of the
Windows desktop software that is now familiar mostly in palm-size
computers, where it has been slow to win converts. It would be the
foundation for tens of thousands of vibrant software applications
and an intensely competitive market of hardware makers all vying to
compete on price and performance.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the PC itself would control an ever-expanding world of
``smart'' peripherals _ TVs, audio systems, telephones, kitchen
appliances and other electronic gadgets.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't the post-PC era; it's the PC-plus era,'' said Craig
Mundie, Microsoft's senior vice president for consumer strategy.
``The PC may be simpler to use in the future, but it will still
broker lots of home services and control other smart appliances.''
</P>
<P>
   That vision presents a potentially grim future for Sony's $38
billion consumer electronics business. As a global standard setter,
Sony has enjoyed high margins and big market shares. But the
``PC-ization'' of consumer electronics would most likely mean a
world of increasing uniformity and low margins, like those that
computer makers have experienced.
</P>
<P>
   Sony's view of the digital future is far more decentralized. Its
product designers sniff that the PC is the obsolete ``mainframe''
of the home. Instead, they envision homes in which dozens, even
hundreds, of smart appliances are seamlessly interconnected,
perhaps without a PC involved at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft is going to have to change their business model to
be effective in the world of consumer electronics,'' said Mario
Tokoro, the computer scientist who is president of Sony's
Information Technology Laboratories and a top adviser to Idei on
computing and networking issues.
</P>
<P>
   The system envisioned by Sony would let the consumer control a
digital videocassette recorder from the television set, or vice
versa _ or control them both from a cellular phone. In recent
demonstrations, the company has shown an integrated audio and video
system tied together by I-Link, a high-speed digital connection to
the cable box.
</P>
<P>
   It will allow people to watch movies on demand, pause a live
basketball game in mid-jump shot to go to the kitchen for a
sandwich _ then watch the rest of the game on delay _ or transmit a
home video to a friend on the other side of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the new Playstation II, introduced last week and
scheduled to arrive in the United States next year, would connect
to the network, serving as a digital versatile disk, or DVD,
player, and perhaps even as a cable set-top box.
</P>
<P>
   The collision of these competing visions has resulted in what
one Sony executive calls a ``strategic dance.'' Publicly, Sony has
announced ambitious strategic alliances with Microsoft in the last
two years to design consumer electronics products; quietly, it has
been reshaping itself into what is likely to soon become
Microsoft's most dangerous competitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The relationship is fearful and respectful and wary,'' said
Sealey, the consultant to Sony.
</P>
<P>
   One measure of Sony's commitment to a digital future is that by
the end of next year, it plans to employ an equal number of
software and hardware engineers, according to Akikazu Takeuchi,
president of Sony's Platform Software Development Center, which has
recently built software laboratories in Japan, Europe and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   The outlines of Sony's new software-centric strategy are already
clear at the company's vast development and marketing center here
in Silicon Valley.

 &UR; SAN JOSE, Calif.: Silicon Valley. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A fast-growing group of software programmers are putting the
finishing touches on a new operating system called Aperios, which
is intended to control digital TVs, cellular phones, even robot
``pets'' that Sony plans to introduce later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Aperios and Windows CE will face off for the first time later
this year, too, as cable companies decide which operating system
they will use in a new generation of set-top boxes that will bring
interactive television to millions of homes.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the introduction of the new cable boxes will be the
first round in the struggle for dominance over the next generation
of computing. And for Sony, its role as a leader in consumer
electronics, an industry it virtually invented, is at stake.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional wisdom in Silicon Valley has long been that for all
its excellence in hardware design, Japan, for cultural reasons, has
habitually lagged behind in software development, which benefits
from free-spirited individualism.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Sony's computer researchers defy the stereotypes. Regular
visitors say the company's computer laboratory in Tokyo could
easily be mistaken for one in San Jose or Santa Clara, right down
to the comfortable beanbag chairs. And Tokoro, who heads the labs,
is not only a well-respected researcher but also the acknowledged
architect of the company's ambitious software strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of the first Japanese labs that was an
American-style lab, with open doors and no hierarchy,'' said David
J. Farber, a professor of computer science at the University of
Pennsylvania. ``The young researchers there are happy to argue with
Mario, which is unheard of in that culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the arrival of Aperios will put Sony's commitment to
computer software to the test. And some Sony insiders worry that
the company's bureaucracy _ its many divisions' conflicting agendas
and its stodgy ``salaryman'' pay practices _ will thwart the
software revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the company has occasionally chased down technological
blind alleys, most famously in the case of the Betamax. And until
last year, when it re-entered the PC market with innovative,
ultrathin laptops, it had failed consistently in personal computers
and work stations.
</P>
<P>
   Still, executives say Sony has made the important leap of
recognizing that the very nature of its business has changed. ``To
Sony's credit, we now realize that our competitor is no longer
Toshiba or Panasonic, but it's Microsoft and Dell,'' said one
executive in the company's United States personal computer
business, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   And Sony has hard-won experience with the business model it is
counting on for success in the software world.
</P>
<P>
   The template is the company's conquest of the video-game
business. In a bruising battle with Tokyo, Olaf Olafsson, then
president of Sony's Interactive Entertainment division, persuaded
the company to look for profits in software and licensing, and to
sell the game hardware at cost.
</P>
<P>
   The fight ultimately led Olafsson to resign in 1996. But the
Sony Playstation became _ and remains _ a runaway hit in both the
United States and Japan. Sony Computer, which is largely the
Playstation business, provided 26.5 percent of Sony's operating
profits in the first half of the current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   Olafsson, now president of the Advanta Corp., a financial
services company, said Sony had no alternative but to pursue a
similar course as it confronts the PC world head-on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sony will never succeed as a just another clone
manufacturer,'' he said. ``It's not a manufacturing company per se,
and it won't make the cheapest PC. I would say they have to find
something else.''
</P>
<P>
   That something else could help change the way Wall Street views
the company, whose stock declined in 1998 as a result of the Asian
economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole Japanese market has been struggling,'' noted Peter
G. Wolff of the investment bank ING Barings in New York. But, he
added, Sony has recently begun to show promise. Among Japanese
companies, ``Sony has been regarded as the most international, and
with the best brand name,'' Wolff said.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, Sony executives _ like others in the consumer
electronics industry _ have come to realize that Microsoft covets
markets that are not part of the traditional personal computer
business. It already sells toys and games, and it is developing a
growing array of smart consumer electronic gadgets.
</P>
<P>
   Sony also recognizes the risk of relying on Microsoft to set
software standards for the dawning age of digital consumer
electronics. The broad agreements between Idei and William H.
Gates, Microsoft's chief executive, to cooperate on a new
generation of information appliances have so far gone nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a love-and-hate relationship,'' Tokoro said. ``Each of
us has our own territory. But the computer people need consumer
electronics markets to grow, and by cooperating with us they want
to expand into our territory.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft executives, of course, have a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sony has been recognizing, begrudgingly, that the
microprocessor is going to find its way into the traditional lines
of business,'' said Mundie of Microsoft. ``But the PC will remain
an important launching pad for them.''
</P>
<P>
   The ambivalence _ a rivalry fraught with mutual needs and
fundamental differences _ is nothing new. Immediately after
arriving to head Sony's United States business in April 1997,
Howard Stringer, long a top executive at CBS, called an internal
meeting to develop a strategy for Sony's relationship with
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Stringer said last week that the company was still monitoring
the relationship closely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes we waltz and sometimes we stand on the opposite side
of the dance floor,'' he said. ``And just like dancing, it's best
not to talk about the bedroom while you're on the dance floor,
because who knows where you might end up.''

 &UR; SAN JOSE, Calif.: end up.'' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   While the real engagement is still ahead, each side has already
begun to marshal its forces.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft and Intel have been signing up consumer electronics
makers, including Mitsubishi and Honeywell, to support a new
standard known as the Home Application Programming Interface
alliance, or Home API. These standards are intended to make the
personal computer the control center for all kinds of home
appliances.
</P>
<P>
   Sony, Philips Electronics and six other consumer electronics
makers have countered with their own standard, known as Home Audio
Visual Interoperatibility, or HAVI (pronounced HAH-vee).
</P>
<P>
   HAVI operates in tandem with the I-Link digital cable developed
by Apple Computer, a technology designed to move digital video and
audio efficiently between home entertainment components. But it
does not require a PC; instead, the microprocessing power is within
the components and appliances themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Sony recently began giving demonstrations of HAVI-equipped
entertainment centers that include not only TV, cable and audio
gear but also a new kind of device that works much like a digital
VCR and performs many of the storage and retrieval functions of a
personal computer's hard disk. The first HAVI-compatible systems
may be introduced as early as this Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Through the cable set-top box, with the Aperios operating
system, all this equipment can be connected to the Internet at
lightning speed.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts expect Sony to complete the picture by announcing its
own multimedia ``portal,'' a Web site from which music, movies and
software can be downloaded, with Sony charging a fee for each
transaction.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Sony and its allies announced last month that HAVI
would interconnect with Sun Microsystems' Jini software, which is
also intended to allow all sorts of computers and appliances to
work together seamlessly, independent of a Windows-driven computer.
</P>
<P>
   The first big test of Sony's vision will come later this year
when the cable TV industry rolls out a new set-top cable box built
by the General Instrument Co., with the almost comically
old-fashioned name DCT-5000. Cable system operators will be able to
decide whether to use Sony's or Microsoft's software, or that of
other companies, in the boxes they deliver to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   These operators have been promising powerful interactive cable
systems since the beginning of the 1990s; the DCT-5000 helps make
it possible, technologically. And AT&AMP;T's entry into the cable
business, through its pending acquisition of Tele-Communications
Inc., provides the financial muscle and competitive impetus that
the industry may have lacked.
</P>
<P>
   As powerful as today's most advanced personal computers, the new
set-top box will serve as the brain for dozens of activities,
including Internet browsing, local and long-distance telephone
service, video games, movies on demand and many new home
applications, like easy-to-use electronic phone books or
call-screening based on Caller ID technology.
</P>
<P>
   The possibilities are as limitless as software designers'
imaginations. For example, the TV might replace today's ubiquitous
home audio baby monitor. With a camera in the nursery, parents
could keep tabs on a sleeping tot, using the picture-in-a-picture
feature of the family-room TV. And if the baby does something cute,
it will be possible to save a video clip and then send it over the
cable network to be viewed on the grandparents' television on the
other side of the country.
</P>
<P>
   The cable industry and its partners are betting that when
families want to enter cyberspace, they would rather settle down on
a sofa in front of the TV than sit at a desk staring into a
computer display.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a consumer, you will care less that this is not a personal
computer,'' said David E. Robinson, senior vice president of
General Instrument.
</P>
<P>
   Eager to avoid re-creating the PC business model, the cable
industry, led by John C. Malone, the electrical engineer turned
chairman of Tele-Communications, structured a deal in which
Microsoft, Sony, Sun and other companies all are providing software
for the set-top box. No company has a monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   The companies were eager to be part of the deal, in the hope
that beyond supplying their operating systems they would be able to
sell highly profitable services _ like pay-per-play video games _
directly to the consumer.
</P>
<P>
   Subscribers will pick different services from cable operators,
rather than worrying about hardware and software, Robinson said.
But the kinds of applications that the new set-top boxes will make
possible are the sort at which Sony has long excelled.
</P>
<P>
   General Instrument, partly owned by both TCI and Sony, will make
some boxes with special Sony I-Link connectors. And soon, perhaps
even later this year, the cable industry plans to allow consumer
electronics companies to produce set-top boxes under their own
names.
</P>
<P>
   Then it will be possible to go to a store and buy a Sony-made
set-top box, or a cable-ready Sony digital TV with the Aperios
operating system. Indeed, they may compete directly with systems
from other consumer electronics companies with built-in Microsoft
software.
</P>
<P>
   And in the end, it will be the consumer who decides whether the
future will be a post-PC or a PC-centric world.

RESISTANCE IS FUTILE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY  
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: The new Pentium III has a serial number that
has to be entered before it works. When it is entered, your
processor can communicate with ``headquarters,'' and Intel and
others can see exactly what is on your computer. Soon, the computer
programmers will have control of everything that we do.
</P>
<P>
   _ Chicken Little
</P>
<P>
   DEAR LITTLE: We already do, Einstein. Look, if you think Intel
is masterminding some international master plan that will let them
find out you downloaded all those pictures of Melissa Joan Hart,
I've got news for you: Everybody already knew about it long before
the Pentium III.
</P>
<P>
   Things are getting blown way out of proportion. The chip ID is
intended to be an added layer of security for things like
e-commerce: You might steal my MasterCard number and my password,
but you're not using them to buy Viagra on the Web until you steal
my computer, too. Besides, anybody who knows me would know that I'd
never need Viagra. Stop laughing. It's true. Really.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of things have happened since the last time I wrote
about all the loons out there who think Intel has nothing better to
do than spy on them. First, Intel came up with a utility that
prevents anyone from obtaining your serial number. Second, some
hackers found a way around that. Big whoop. Like that's never
happened before.
</P>
<P>
   When you plug into the Internet, you might as well give up any
thoughts of privacy. Web sites have always been able to track you
and what you're doing, and any geek with a copy of ``Back Orifice''
and some free time can find his way inside your computer. How do
you think I found out about Melissa?
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I want to get new equipment and move into the
21st century with everyone else, but how do I get rid of the old
stuff? Taking it for a ride to the dump just doesn't seem
environmentally friendly. Also, if I can actually find someone who
will take the computer off my hands, how do I purge the hard drive
so they can't reconstruct all those steamy letters I wrote when I
used to have a love life?
</P>
<P>
   _ Movin' On Up
</P>
<P>
   DEAR UP: Luckily, I never had that problem. With getting rid of
computers, I mean. No, really. Women send me steamy love letters
all the time. And underwear. I can prove it.
</P>
<P>
   My philosophy is to work a computer until it drops, because
you'll never get anybody to buy it. Sometimes, a computer gets
demoted to doing different things, like being a game machine or
someplace to experiment with Linux. Or I'll use parts out of the
old machine in the new one.
</P>
<P>
   The way technology doubles every three minutes doesn't help the
used-computer market. There will always be neophytes out there who
want the cheapest computer they can find, but when they can get a
new PC for under a thousand bucks or an iMac for not much more,
your 10-year-old doorstop isn't too attractive.
</P>
<P>
   If you do find a chump, though, don't worry too much about your
love letters. A simple file deletion or formatting the hard drive
is usually enough to stump most people. Anyway, I didn't find your
letters all that interesting. Well, certainly not as interesting as
mine. No, really. It's true.

REMOVABLE STORAGE HAS NO STANDARD, YET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN  
c.1999 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) Having some form of large, removable storage on a
personal computer is becoming more and more crucial. Though it
remains an important part of any PC, the standard 1.44-megabyte
floppy drive no longer has the capacity for the kinds of things
that many people are doing with their systems these days.
</P>
<P>
   The plummeting price of hardware has made removable storage much
more affordable, in many different forms. However, there's not yet
a defining standard that is as ubiquitous as the floppy, so you'll
have to choose based on what's best for your needs.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at three drives that illustrate two different
approaches to having megabytes to go:
</P>
<P>
   __ Zip 100 USB _ $150, Iomega Corp. The Zip drive is the closest
thing we have to a new standard as a ``super-floppy,'' but it's not
quite there. More and more new computers come with them, but
usually as an option. You just can't rely on everyone having a Zip
drive, as you can with a standard floppy.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, if you wanted a portable Zip drive, you could move
from computer to computer, you had to rely on either the SCSI or
parallel-port models. The SCSI version required that a PC have a
SCSI card, which few do. (Not so for the Macintosh version _ all
Macs up until recently had SCSI connectors.) The parallel port,
which could be used on virtually every PC, was dog-slow. Copying
the contents of a nearly full, 100-MB Zip disk could take seemingly
forever.
</P>
<P>
   At long, long last, Iomega has introduced a USB-based version of
its 100-MB Zip. The company originally was not planning to move as
quickly as it did, but the popularity of Apple Computer's iMac _
which has no floppy disk but includes a USB port _ forced Iomega's
hand.
</P>
<P>
   And it's a good thing. While the USB version is not as fast as
the internal model sold in many Windows-based PCs, it is
significantly peppier than the parallel port. It took only a few
seconds to transfer a 10-MB file via the USB port, compared with
nearly 90 seconds with one of the original parallel-port Zips.
</P>
<P>
   The USB model comes in a translucent green case, and to me, the
plastic felt a little flimsy. Treat this baby with care.
</P>
<P>
   __ Zip 250 Parallel _ $200, Iomega Corp. When I first heard that
Iomega was finally going to sell a Zip with a greater capacity of
250 MB, and that it could also read the original 100-MB disks, I
was overjoyed. Then I learned the awful truth.
</P>
<P>
   There are only two configurations _ SCSI and parallel. Where's
the USB model?
</P>
<P>
   In my dreams. Or, at the very least, somewhere in Iomega's
plans.
</P>
<P>
   I tried out the parallel port version, and while it wasn't as
sluggish as the original Zip, it is certainly no speed demon. It
seems to be about 30 percent faster, but much slower than the USB
model. It took a full minute to copy a 10-MB file.
</P>
<P>
   At least the case on this one was quite sturdy, with a nice
curved design that will look snazzy on anyone's desk.
</P>
<P>
   Having 250 MB of space, though, is quite a plus, and it's
necessary for Iomega to compete with Sony and other manufacturers,
who have introduced 200-MB-plus removable disks. The greater
capacity should be particularly helpful to anyone who works with
large graphics or video files, and with the boom in scanners and
digital cameras among home users, that's more and more of us.
</P>
<P>
   The 250-MB disks cost a little more than the 100-MB disks:
$17-$18 in multipacks, compared with about $12-$13.
</P>
<P>
   __ Backpack CD-ReWriter _ $449, MicroSolutions. If your need for
removable space goes way beyond 100 or even 250 megabytes, you'd do
well to look at a writeable CD-ROM drive. There are both internal
and external models. The internals are cheaper and somewhat faster,
but the external models have been used on multiple PCs.
</P>
<P>
   I looked at MicroSolutions' new external drive. It can handle
both kinds of writeable CDs _ CD-R, which lets you write to the
disk just once; and CD-RW, which lets you write to it over and over
again, just like a hard or floppy disk.
</P>
<P>
   Each type has its benefits and best uses. CD-R disks are cheap _
about $2 to $3 in bulk _ and are faster. CD-RW disks are more
expensive _ about $17 to $20 each _ and are a little slower in the
writing process.
</P>
<P>
   CD-R is great for making duplicates of existing disks, or
storing programs or data you don't expect to change. This also is
the medium you'd use to make audio CDs to be used in any compact
disc player.
</P>
<P>
   CD-RW can be used for backing up crucial data, just like a tape
or removeable floppy. Unfortunately, it can't be read in all CD
drives _ only those that support the Multi-Read standard.
</P>
<P>
   The Backpack CD-ReWriter can write to a drive in 4X speed (four
times the speed of the first CD-ROM drives), and reads at 6X
speeds. It takes about 20 minutes to fill up a 650-MB disk. On
older computers, though, you may not be able to achieve these
speeds.
</P>
<P>
   It comes with an older version of Adaptec's excellent Easy CD
Creator software, which makes creating a CD in either format a
snap. I'd highly recommend upgrading to the newest version, Easy CD
Creator Deluxe 3.5, which comes with some very useful components.
For example, it has CD Spin Doctor, which lets you turn your vinyl
LP collection into CDs, and a module for putting video on CD.
</P>
<P>
   Although I'm enthusiastic about the Backpack, parallel ports can
be finicky. For example, I had some problems getting a
Hewlett-Packard DeskJet 882C printer to co-exist on the parallel
port with this drive. I'd love to see MicroSolutions offer a USB
version of the Back CD-ReWriter.

IT'S IRELAND VS. SCOTLAND ON THE SINGLE-MALT FRONT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DOUG BLACKBURN  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The luck of the Americans. The Irish are now competing with the
Scots in the spirit industry's fastest growing niche market:
single-malt whiskey. And without a doubt, we are the big winners.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the Irish don't know a thing or two about distilling
smooth sipping whiskey. Black Bush, Jameson's, Paddy's, Powers and
Tullamore Dew are all excellent examples of the Emerald Isle's
ability.
</P>
<P>
   But they are also blends, vatted with less costly grain whiskeys
in order to lower production costs as well as price. During the
past decade, their sales have been dwarfed by single-malt Scotch
whiskeys, which, by shrewd marketing, have captured the American
imagination like no other spirit in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   We're talking high-end, conspicuous consumption, of course.
Forty or more dollars a bottle. Is it only a coincidence that sales
of single-malt Scotches and pricey sport utility vehicles are
occurring at the same time the stock market is soaring?
</P>
<P>
   No matter. The Irish are entering the fray. Let us welcome them.
Knappogue (pronounced nuh-Pogue) Castle, named after the castle on
Ireland's west coast in County Clare, has during the past year
slowly become available in the United States. The sole importer is
Great Spirits in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   It is a superb single malt, crisp and clean with delicate malt
notes. Many of the Scottish single malts use peat in the malt
drying process, while Knappogue does not. Hence, it is less smoky
and less intense than, say, Lagavulin, Cragganmore or Talisker.
</P>
<P>
   Knappogue Castle 1991 has a suggested retail price of $32, about
20 percent less than most of its Scottish competitors.
</P>
<P>
   The distillery also produces a 1951, which was aged 36 years in
oak sherry casks and bottled in 1987. It is regarded as the finest
and rarest Irish whiskey available in the world, according to
whiskey expert Jim Murray. At $600 per bottle (yes, six big ones),
it better be.

DEVICE MANAGER, SITES HELP KEEP DRIVERS UPDATED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN  
c.1999 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) Q: Where and how does one check to make sure one has
the latest drivers? If the latest drivers are found to be needed,
where does one locate them?
</P>
<P>
   A: Both Windows 95 and 98 have a feature called the Device
Manager that lets you see what's connected to your system and what
resources it is using. You can also use the Device Manager to
upgrade and remove drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Device Manager also will tell you the date on your drivers, if
you know where to look.
</P>
<P>
   To get to Device Manager, right-click on the My Computer icon,
choose properties, then click on the Device Manager tab. You'll see
a list of components on your system.
</P>
<P>
   As an example, let's find the date on the driver for your video
card. Double-click on Display Adapter _ the item will open to show
you your particular brand and model. Double-click on it.
</P>
<P>
   At the dialog box that appears, click on the Driver tab. You'll
then see the date for the driver.
</P>
<P>
   Next, go to the Web site for the maker of that device. Let's say
you have a Viper V550 video card from Diamond Multimedia. You'd go
to Diamond's Web site (www.diamondmm.com), find the support area
where new drivers are listed and find the one for the Viper V550.
</P>
<P>
   Download it into your computer. If you're unsure about how to
download software, see the Web site mentioned in this week's Other
Voices column offered by CNet _ it's a step-by-step tutorial for
downloading software.
</P>
<P>
   Many Web sites also have instructions, or one may be included in
a README.TXT file that comes with the drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Once you've upgraded all your drivers, check the Web sites at
least once every 60 days to see if there are newer drivers. Video
drivers are upgraded frequently.
</P>
<P>
   You can also check at any of several Web sites that track
updates, including Frank's World o' Windows at
www.conitech.com/windows/, WinDrivers at www.windrivers.com and The
Driver Zone at www.driverzone.com.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In the Feb. 5 Help Line in the Technology Section, you
supplied an answer to a question about why Windows reports a
6.4-gigabyte hard disk as 5.9 gigabytes. Your answer, I think,
misses the mark. Manufacturers use a factor of 1,000 when
converting bytes to kilobytes, megabytes and gigabytes. If a
manufacturer builds a disk of 6,400,000,000 bytes, they report its
size as 6,400,000 kilobytes, or 6,400 megabytes, or 6.4 gigabytes.
</P>
<P>
   Windows, on the other hand, uses a factor of 1,024 for each of
the conversion steps, so in Windows terminology, 6,400,000,000
bytes is equal to 6,250,000 kilobytes, or 6,103 megabytes, or 5.96
gigabytes.
</P>
<P>
   Although both expressions refer to exactly the same capacity _
in this case, 6.4 billion bytes _ the manufacturer's terminology
makes it sound bigger than Windows' terminology. Just more
marketing hype.
</P>
<P>
   A: Actually, we are both right. However, you are more right than
I am. And it's not marketing hype, but a difference in the way they
are counted.
</P>
<P>
   According to Western Digital, the largest manufacturer of PC
hard drives, there are two ways to count bytes _ decimal, which is
what the drive and BIOS makers use, and binary, which Windows uses.
That accounts for most of the difference.
</P>
<P>
   However, as indicated by the frequently asked questions document
at www.westerndigital.com/service/FAQ/win98.html, some megabytes
indeed are lost to formatting overhead. In some cases, a computer
BIOS may also claim a cylinder _ a segment of drive space _ for its
own purposes.

NEW CARTOON SERIES ARE TRULY INTERACTIVE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By PATTI HARTIGAN   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   See the kitty with the goo-goo eyes. So precious. So cuddly. So
annoying. Are you tired of the kitty-cat's peepers? No problem.
Just click a button and they disappear. Click again and replace
them with snake eyes or Picasso-like, cubist orbs.
</P>
<P>
   This is a cartoon lover's dream, an animated feature where the
viewer actually gets to change the characters' features and to
determine the plot. It's genuine interactivity, the future of
animated entertainment, and it's happening now at a few sites on
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The cute kitty, for instance, is in a new series of experimental
toons recently launched by Cartoon Network Online, the web site of
Ted Turner's cable network. The network, which is at
http://cartoonnetwork.com, didn't go for the obvious by retooling
old classics. Instead, it recruited two underground artists _ Gary
Panter, the maestro of punk and designer of ``Pee-Wee's
Playhouse,'' and Mark Newgarden, creator of the notorious ``Garbage
Pail Kids'' trading cards. Panter came up with a series called
``The Pink Donkey and the Fly,'' a surprisingly sweet toon about a
braying animal who gets into trouble like Eve in the Garden of
Eden.
</P>
<P>
   Newgarden's creation, on the other hand, is deliciously warped.
It's called ``B. Happy,'' a series about a foul fowl who is
anything but joyous. This blue bird of unhappiness encounters that
cute little kitty and crazy things happen. Newgarden introduces the
fabulous Click-a-Rama feature, where viewers get to make all sorts
of amusing choices. There are plenty of on-line jokes built into
the feature; without spoiling the fun, let's just say there are
times when the program seems to malfunction, sort of like real
life. The cantankerous bird also does a high-tech version of what
theater folks call tearing down the fourth wall: The big blue bird
bangs on the screen, mouthing off at all those computer geeks on
the other side.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been told that `B. Happy' is similar to me in my fouler
moods,'' Newgarden says quite cheerfully during a telephone chat.
``Let's say I'm going for a satiric bent.'' Newgarden is just like
all the rest of us when it comes to ``interactivity'' on the Net.
He knows that nine times out of ten, when you are urged to click a
button on the Internet, you're offered a ``hot'' opportunity to buy
some unique (read: useless) product or subscribe to some innovative
(read: expensive) service. He parodies that in his on-line toon.
</P>
<P>
   Interactivity, of course, is the buzzword of the moment in the
constantly morphing Internet entertainment industry. Newgarden has
big dreams for the future: ``I see a time when shows are implanted
in everyone's brain on a small chip; do away with television, do
away with the computer and go directly to the middle of the head.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, animation is clearly way ahead of video when it
comes to entertainment on the Net. Streaming video _ which might
better be called screaming video _ is an overhyped technology. It
takes forever to download, and then you have to squint at grainy
images on a teen-tiny screen about 2 1/2 inches wide. Thanks to a
technology called Macromedia Flash, animation is fast, and the
resolution is crisp.
</P>
<P>
   ``What bothers me about streaming video is that it's trying to
hammer one medium into the other, trying to make the computer look
like television,'' says Peter Girardi, creative director of Funny
Garbage, the web design firm that produced the Cartoon Network
series.
</P>
<P>
   These web features aren't like your typical Saturday morning
toons. That doesn't mean the folks at the Cartoon Network wouldn't
like to spin one of the new characters off in television land.
``The Internet is like the Neilsen ratings on steroids,'' says Sam
Register, vice president of Cartoon Network Online. ``People
respond quickly, and you get really great feedback. It would be
great if we found our next new hit character on-line.''
</P>
<P>
   Cartoon Network isn't the only outfit experimenting in
interactive animation: In 1997, John Kricfalusi, the creator of the
``Ren and Stimpy Show'' who was booted by Nickelodeon honchos for
being too outrageous, launched his own animated web series at
spumco.com. It features George Liquor, a red-blooded American who
swears a blue streak while he's taking care of his nitwit nephew.
It's like ``South Park'' fueled by grain alcohol _ crude, lewd and
bitingly funny. It's also honest about its commercial ventures: Its
advertisements are built into the content of the show, a technique
that is shamelessly refreshing. Hey, everybody wants to make money
out of the Internet, so why not just be honest about it? Honesty is
what drives Newgarden and his character, B. Happy. A lot of
so-called ``interactive'' content is pretty canned; Newgarden toys
around with that notion in his series. ``When I was a kid, I had
this play telephone,'' Newgarden says. ``You would push a button
and Mickey Mouse would say `Hi.' I'd say `Hi' back and Mickey Mouse
wouldn't respond. It felt like a cheat. The interaction has to be
framed in a way so it doesn't seem like a cheat.''
</P>
<P>
   I certainly didn't feel cheated when I made the cute kitty's
eyes go bye-bye or when B. Happy banged on the screen, shouting,
``You double crossed me, computer geek!'' The next episode will be
on-line Monday. This geek is ready.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of tunes, there's a new comprehensive site at
http://www.tunes.com (formerly www.jamtv.com). This ``music hub''
provides an astonishing compilation of audio and video clips, as
well as access to the archives of Rolling Stone, The Source, and
Down Beat. yes, you can buy music, too, through links to e-commerce
sites.

BROWSERS ANONYMOUS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By HIAWATHA BRAY   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Yes, Hiawatha Bray is my real name, though some refuse to
believe it. I've had people compliment me on dreaming up such a
splendid pen name, one that makes me sound mysterious and exotic.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, I'm about as exotic as the south side of Chicago. And
being named Hiawatha Bray can have its disadvantages for an
Internet journalist. When I post a message on the Internet's Usenet
bulletin board system, seeking tips on how to beat a computer game,
I sometimes get replies like this: ``Are you THAT Hiawatha Bray?
Your column stinks. Get a clue! P.S. Love your nickname.''
</P>
<P>
   You can see why I sometimes post Usenet messages anonymously.
The ability to communicate across the world without having to
identify yourself is one of the Internet's most attractive
features. It's also proving to be one of its most troublesome.
</P>
<P>
   Anonymity is often the enemy of clear communications. For one
thing, it liberates people to engage in rude on-line ``flame
wars,'' secure in the knowledge that their vulgarity won't earn
them the black eyes and busted lips they deserve.
</P>
<P>
   Others use their anonymity to spread information that's just not
true, or information that was supposed to remain confidential.
Lately certain aggrieved parties have fought back through the
courts, thereby demonstrating how flimsy Internet anonymity can be.
</P>
<P>
   In our own back yard, Raytheon Co. is suing 21 employees for
disclosing company data in a message board run by the Yahoo
Internet service. Trouble is, Raytheon doesn't know who the
employees are. So it's gone to court to subpoena their identities
from Yahoo. If the subpoena is issued, Yahoo says it will comply.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in no way trying to harm freedom of expression,'' says
Raytheon spokesman Dave Polk. ``We're trying to protect proprietary
information.'' But civil libertarians fret about a chilling effect
on Internet free speech.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Rotenberg, Georgetown University law professor and
executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center,
notes that courts have upheld the right of political activists to
preserve their anonymity. But companies like Yahoo that provide you
with Internet services usually require that you identify yourself,
and the courts say that this personal data can be subpoenaed.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to complain about this. I have no patience with people
who give away company secrets or spread hurtful lies on the
Internet, then cower behind the shield of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   And yet anonymity can be a godsend for the battered spouse
looking for help, the corporate whistle-blower, the journalist
looking for tips. If cases like Raytheon's continue to mount, will
any on-line anonymity be left to us?
</P>
<P>
   Just a bit. E-mail offers some hope of secrecy, through
``anonymous remailers'' that route e-mail through several
computers, making it very hard to trace. But because of the
complicated path your message takes, it can take hours or days for
a remailed message to arrive. In addition, you can't use remailers
to post Usenet messages without a fair amount of technical
knowledge and a good deal of work.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are Internet discussion sites that don't care who you
are, and don't collect any personal info, not even your real name.
There are places like the geek hangout Slashdot
(http://www.slashdot.org), where you can publish criticisms of the
latest technologies under the generic nickname ``Anonymous
Coward.'' Or consider Free Republic (http://freerepublic.com), a
rambunctious conservative Web site that welcomes anonymous insults
of liberals in general and President Clinton in particular.
</P>
<P>
   There are many such places on-line, but all in the minor
leagues. Major providers of free e-mail like Yahoo collect
information about you, if only to sell you something. I use one of
these free accounts to post my ``anonymous'' Usenet messages, but
I'm not anonymous to the company that provides the service. I'd
better watch what I say about Raytheon.
</P>
<P>
   These secret Web accounts are about as anonymous as license
plates: Civilians can't read them, but techies and cops sure can.
But they do offer some protection from unwanted junk mail, as well
as a chance to dream up a clever new name for yourself _ a severe
challenge for me. How do you top Hiawatha?

 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Mike Kaplan, aka Smoot, allowed the Web camera to be
installed in his Brandeis University dorm room last month, thereby
giving all the world an Internet peek at his life, it was the kind
of exposure he certainly didn't mind. Indeed, it was enough to make
the 20-year-old junior forget that he'd recently been rejected as a
candidate for ``Real World,'' MTV's slice of twentysomething life.
Being seen on the Net would do just fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I'm on camera,'' Kaplan announced proudly in his journal,
which accompanies the online snapshots of his fourth-floor room in
Ziv Quad. ``Go me.''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to WebDorm. True, there are no dining halls here, no
vending machines, and little that would pass for partying. But,
hey, this is virtual college life, with tiny cameras in about two
dozen dorm rooms across the country sending snapshots every 30
seconds to a commercial Web site (www.webdorm.com). WebDormers, who
use aliases, can also chat online with visitors, post their musings
in their journals, and receive messages in a ``guestbook.'' But the
principal hook here is clearly the spherical black QuickCams which
make semi-stars out of just plain undergrads.
</P>
<P>
   Katie Lioy, known as NeonQueen around the WebDorm, keeps her
camera on top of three CDs, which rest atop a computer printer,
which squats on top of a small desk, which is tucked into the
corner of a jam-packed Emerson College dorm room in downtown
Boston. Lioy, an 18-year-old freshman majoring in TV production and
says that kickboxing is just about her favorite thing to do,
decided to become a WebDormer for a common reason: ``It seemed like
a cool thing to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do normal teenage stuff,'' is the way Lioy describes her
dorm life. ``I sleep, eat, read, do homework, talk on the phone. To
the other college students who watch me online, I'm someone. .
.what's the word?. . .someone to identify with.''
</P>
<P>
   As tiny as Lioy's room is, the QuickCam covers only a portion of
it. That's fine with Jessica Fogel, Lioy's roommate, who strongly
perfers to stay out of camera range. ``I don't really get it,''
Fogel muses of the desire to appear on the Net or to sit at a
distant computer and shmooz online with WebDormers. ``But if these
people are having their fun, why not?''
</P>
<P>
   (One WebDorm visitor from New Hampshire recently expressed his
skepticism in a different way. ``All that time on the computer
could be spent doing something constructive, like drinking,'' he
wrote.)
</P>
<P>
   WebDorm is part of Woburn-based CollegeWeb.com, a small company
which was founded last June by Alex Chriss, now a 21-year-old
senior at Tufts University. Chriss's motivation _ besides signing
up advertisers _ was to counter what he calls the ``lazy,
beer-drinking, party-animal'' stereotype of college students.
Participants are not paid (although they can keep their cameras
after a semester as WebDormers), and they're chosen after filling
out an email questionnaire. ``There are no real rules, but we do
ask them not to do anything illegal,'' Chriss says. ``If it ends up
being boring, well, that's real college. This isn't scripted. It's
not Hollywood. There are no explosions and there's no sex, although
the WeDormers can show whatever they want to show as long as it's
not illegal.''
</P>
<P>
   Spend some time in the WebDorm, however, and you'll discover
that they don't show much. Voyeurs will be sorely disappointed.
Cameras are frequently pointed at desks, and always away from
bathrooms. They tend to reveal the likes of cluttered closets,
music posters, or someone watching TV. Frequently there aren't even
any human beings in the pictures. Or there might be a sign, to wit:
``I'm on Spring break!! Back on 3/6/99 :)''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Chriss's ``real college'' can be _ and is _ highly
edited by its participants. At Brandeis, Kaplan readily admits he
enjoys the idea of being on camera, but he never forgets its
presence. ``I'm very careful of where I stand when I don't have any
clothes on,'' he points out. He's also cautious when his girlfriend
visits. ``Obviously, we're not going to broadcast something
indiscreet,'' he says. ``There are times when we point the camera
someplace less. . .interesting.'' (There's no audio track in the
Webdorm.)
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, neighbors who visit their WebDorm friends are given
fair warning. ``You're on camera while in this room,'' a sign
announces at each door. Says Chriss: ``This is not a candid
camera.'' Still, a cameo appearance on the Net carries a certain
cache. ``All my friends want to come over and sit in front of the
camera,'' says Brian McGunagle (screen name: Jose), a 20-year-old
sophomore WebDormer at Trinity College in Connecticut. ``They think
being on the Web is like being on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   WebDorm's conservatism comes as good news to Sandy Lioy, Katie's
mom. When her daughter told her last month that she was taking her
dorm life online, Sandy Lioy was a tad concerned. ``I was worried
that someone might find out who she is and track her down,'' she
says. ``Maybe I'm overprotective, but I'm her mother. I was also
worried about her privacy. But now that I know she can just show as
much of the room as she wants to, I feel better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides, now I can check up on her. Like, one day she put a
sign over the photo of her room. It said, `I'm doing homework now.
Don't bother me.' So I wrote in her guest book, `It does my heart
good to see your parents' money being put to good use.' ''
</P>
<P>
   WebDormers and WedDorm administrators are armed with the
technology to boot out any virtual visitors whom they feel are
acting inappropriately, and Chriss admits this has happened on a
number of occasions. At the University of New Hampshire,
19-year-old sophomore Amanda Patrick (``Sassy'') says that one
thing being a WebDormer has taught her is that ``There are a lot of
weirdos out there.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been guys who've asked me and my roommate to flash
the camera,'' Patrick laments. ``And there was a guy who said he
was in his 40s who was coming on to my roommate. We kicked him out,
but it was a little disconcerting.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Chriss reports that there is no shortage of college kids
who want to matriculate at WebDorm. ``We've had hundreds of
applications since the site went up,'' he says. ``It's become a
celebrity symbol.'' He also talks of expanding to foreign
universities, and of someday forming a WebDorm alumni association.
``We even got an email from a professor who asked us, `Hey, why
don't you have a `ProfessorCam?' '' Chriss says.
</P>
<P>
   WebDormers must depart their virtual college after a semester.
Katie Lioy, for one, has mixed feelings about graduation. ``I've
gotten to meet some interesting people and I do get attention,''
says the Emerson freshman as she hunkers down in front of the
camera in her well-crammed dorm room. ``But this is just a new
hobby, really. Once it's over, I'll find something else to do.''

 Column: Old Files Are Never Forgotten  
 By David Einstein   
 c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Question: &LR;  I have a Windows 95 computer that I am thinking
about donating. But before I do, I want to make sure that my hard
drive is completely erased. I've heard that files deleted in the
usual way can still be recovered. What can I do to ensure that all
the files have been purged?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Answer: &LR;  You heard right. Files can often be recovered even
after you've sent them to the recycle bin and emptied it. In order
to completely expunge data from a disk, you should overwrite it
multiple times with other information. Fortunately, there are some
free downloads that can do that for you. Two popular ones are
BCWipe from Jetico and Eraser from Sami Tolvanen. (There's also a
good $30 shareware program from East Technologies called Eraser.)
All of these programs are at www.hotfiles.com.
</P>
<P>
   Blame the Batteries
</P>
<P>
   Q: The clock in my PC has been slowing down lately. I suspect
it's a battery problem and would appreciate confirmation.
</P>
<P>
   A: Yep, your system's battery is probably the culprit. You
should replace it now, because if it fails altogether, you might
not even be able to start your computer. That's because the battery
makes it possible for the computer to retain critical system
information even when it is turned off.
</P>
<P>
   The best thing to do is contact the company that made the PC and
find out what kind of battery it has and whether or not you can
replace it yourself. If not, you'll have to take it to the service
center in a computer store.
</P>
<P>
   Fight the Power
</P>
<P>
   Q: There are so many types of surge protectors available, rated
at various levels of protection. What is the minimum necessary to
protect my computer?
</P>
<P>
   A: I get this question a lot during winter, when lightning
storms tend to knock out power lines. A basic surge protector just
prevents a sudden surge in power from reaching your computer
system. A typical unit is a specially rigged strip of outlets that
lets you plug in four or six devices, and costs less than $20.
</P>
<P>
   If you're using your PC when the lights go out, however, a surge
protector won't prevent the loss of documents you're working on.
For that, you need an uninterruptible power supply, or UPS. This
device uses a battery to keep your system alive long enough for you
to save any in-progress work and shut down your PC and any
peripherals properly. More-expensive ones can even let you continue
to work for a half hour or so.
</P>
<P>
   UPS units cost from less than $100 up to several hundred
dollars. American Power Conversion, a leading maker of UPS devices,
has a feature on its Web site (www.apcc.com) that helps you
determine what level of protection you need.
</P>
<P>
   Meet the Twain
</P>
<P>
   Q: My publishing software refers to my scanner as a Twain
device. What in the heck does that mean?
</P>
<P>
   COL. 1 of COMPUTE1 (78543 ) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A: Twain stands for Technology Without an Interesting Name.
Honest. It also stands for an interesting American writer. In the
computer world, Twain is a technology standard that allows many
different types of scanners and digital cameras to work with
software such as programs for publishing and managing digital
images.
</P>
<P>
   If you're able to use your scanner with your software, then
don't worry about Twain. All it means is that you've got a good
thing going.

   Most stores won't let you return software for a refund once it's
been opened. So it helps if you know what you're getting before you
commit any cash. Many software companies let you download demo
versions that you can try before you buy. To see if a demo version
is available for a particular program or game, check out the
software maker's Web site, or search for the title in an online
software library such as www.hotfiles.com or www.download.com.

SUSPECT REGISTRATIONS OF DOMAIN NAMES ARE PURGED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By LAURIE J. FLYNN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Network Solutions, the company that assigns Internet addresses,
is again trying to curb what it terms abuses of the registration
system by speculators aiming to turn a quick profit.
</P>
<P>
   The company recently purged 18,000 registrations that it
suspected were held by speculators. In most cases, the company
says, the domain names, as Internet addresses are known, were
registered by people or companies matching the basic profile of a
speculator, meaning they typically had registered thousands of
names at once.
</P>
<P>
   And in nearly every case where a name was purged, the registrant
had not paid for the name on time, giving Network Solutions the
legal right to reclaim it, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These were well-known speculators that had registered
thousands of domains names,'' Christopher Clough, a spokesman for
Network Solutions in Herndon, Va., said. Clough said the company
regularly purged delinquent registrations and specifically targeted
domain name speculators.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate attempt to curb domain name speculation last
month, the company announced a new policy of restricting access to
``root zone'' files, which can alert speculators about when a
domain name will become available. Network Solutions said it would
no longer make the files freely available, but instead would
license them for specific purposes. As a result, many businesses
that help companies secure valuable domain name addresses suddenly
found themselves unable to do business.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Woodward, president of Myinternet.com, a registration
services company, was one of them. Last month he discovered his
company suddenly was unable to access the zone files. After he
threatened to file a lawsuit charging the company with
anticompetitive behavior, his access was restored.
</P>
<P>
   Network Solutions holds a government-backed monopoly in the
registration of the most popular domains. The market is to be
opened to competition later this year.

MOTOROLA INVESTS IN HOME-NETWORK STUDIES  
 FROM CELEBRITY DOCTOR, MEDICAL ADVICE ONLINE  
 TAKING THE FISH MARKET INTO CYBERSPACE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   Motorola Corp. plans to announce Monday that it will donate $5
million to create a new research center at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology Media Laboratory to explore ``think and
link'' technologies that connect everyday appliances.
</P>
<P>
   The research center, to be named the Motorola Digital DNA
Laboratory, will explore concepts that are still years away from
development into commercial products.
</P>
<P>
   One example, according to Hector Ruiz, president of Motorola's
Semiconductor Products division, is a wireless technique known
inside the company as Piano, which can transmit information at
speeds as high as 500 megabits a second over distances of about 10
feet.
</P>
<P>
   There is already a great deal of activity in the computer and
consumer electronics industry on setting standards for connecting
networks of consumer devices. These might include PCs, television
sets, cell phones, personal digital assistants, stereo gear and
various home appliances.
</P>
<P>
   But Ruiz said that it was important to look further into the
future, when such devices might be far smarter, with far more
information and instructions to exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The Motorola Digital DNA Laboratory will be housed in 5,000
square feet within a new building that is scheduled for occupancy
in early 2003 and will be connected to the current MIT Media Lab.
</P>
<P>
   The Media Lab has an annual budget of $30 million. Most of the
financing comes from about 160 corporate sponsors, and the balance
from government agencies and individuals.

   From Celebrity Doctor, Medical Advice Online
</P>
<P>
   Consider it the ultimate play in celebrity marketing. A new Web
site bearing the name of Dr. C. Everett Koop, who as U.S. surgeon
general during the Reagan administration became America's doctor,
is about to join the ranks of Internet initial public offerings.
</P>
<P>
   Forget that drkoop.com, which offers free medical information,
has been up and running for only nine months and last year had
revenues of only $48,000. The association with the outspoken Koop
is what the venture's founders are clearly banking on. The company,
which calls its site ``Your Trusted Health Network,'' will go
public under the Nasdaq symbol KOOP.
</P>
<P>
   Koop founded the company in July 1997 with Don Hackett, a former
executive with Physicians Health Network. The initial investment
was less than $500,000. With its public offering, underwritten by
Bear Stearns &AMP; Co., drkoop.com hopes to raise $50 million, much of
it for an advertising blitz later this year.
</P>
<P>
   As for Koop, he will own 11 percent of the public company, and
he has a five-year deal to receive 2 percent of the company's
revenue. And given the country's apparently insatiable appetite for
free medical advice, that could amount to a tidy sum.
</P>
<P>
   So far at least, Koop's site shows every sign of being a
success. In its first month, it had 2 million visits; these days
2.6 million people visit drkoop.com in a typical month and 83,000
of them are registered as regular users.
</P>
<P>
   The site offers free medical information about diseases and
treatments, discussion groups on subjects like allergies, and
online support groups for recovering alcoholics and others. An
insurance section provides policy quotes and information on
flexible spending accounts.
</P>
<P>
   And as one would expect from a former surgeon general, there are
plenty of reminders that smoking can be hazardous to your health.

   Taking the Fish Market Into Cyberspace
</P>
<P>
   As a third-generation ``fish guy'' in New York City, Stratis
Morfogen practically grew up at the Fulton Fish Market, watching
men dicker over seafood.
</P>
<P>
   Auctions of hard-to-get delicacies were long a staple of the
wholesale market. So when he heard about the growing popularity of
online auctions, Morfogen, who is now 31, realized that he could
fuse the tension of the professional fish auctions with the fun of
``playing along'' at home for the online audience.
</P>
<P>
   After he first saw the Internet a year ago, Morfogen decided to
build his own site, Fultonstreet.com. His father thought he was
crazy, Morfogen said, until 300 orders started coming in each day,
at an average of $90 apiece. This week, Morfogen, who has signed a
deal to be the ``exclusive online fish store'' for Ubid.com, will
start auctioning Alaskan king crab leg gift packages, four-course
dinners for two, and live Maine lobsters. Starting bid: $7.

MICROSOFT'S COUNTERATTACK TO FOCUS ON RIVALS' LINKUP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Microsoft Corp., portrayed by the government as an entrenched
monopolist, will counterattack when its antitrust trial resumes
next month by presenting evidence that suggests that America Online
Inc. plans to become a head-on challenger, according to people
close to the software company.
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft legal tactic focuses on the three-way deal
announced in November, when America Online agreed to buy Netscape
Communications Corp. and made a side agreement to buy and jointly
develop technology with Sun Microsystems Inc.
</P>
<P>
   In December, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who will decide the
outcome of the nonjury trial, expressed his view that the deal
might result in ``a very significant change in the playing field as
far as this industry is concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department's antitrust division announced on Friday
that it had reviewed and approved the America Online-Netscape-Sun
pact, which tightly links three of Microsoft's major rivals. The
America Online purchase of Netscape, made with shares, was valued
at $4.2 billion in November, but is now worth nearly $9 billion,
given the run-up in America Online's stock price.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft started issuing subpoenas for documents last month to
the three companies involved in the deal, as well as to their
financial advisers, after Jackson gave his approval.
</P>
<P>
   The first of the responses to the Microsoft subpoenas, including
documents and internal e-mail that detail the strategy behind the
deal, were received about a week ago by Sullivan &AMP; Cromwell, the
New York law firm representing Microsoft. At Sullivan &AMP; Cromwell, a
team of lawyers, led by Michael Lacovara, a partner, is poring over
the documents, looking for evidence to support Microsoft's defense.
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft legal team also plans to depose key executives
involved in the three-way deal, and perhaps call one or two of them
as rebuttal witnesses. The tentative list of executives to be
examined, according to a person close to the case, includes Stephen
Case, the chairman of America Online; Marc Andreessen, a co-founder
of Netscape, who will become America Online's chief technology
officer, and William Raduchel, the chief strategy officer of Sun
Microsystems.
</P>
<P>
   Another executive at America Online, David Colburn, a senior
vice president, has already appeared as a government witness at the
trial. He testified about a central accusation in the case _ that
America Online chose Microsoft's Internet Explorer as its preferred
browser instead of Netscape's because Microsoft used its monopoly
power as a lever. Microsoft, Colburn testified, offered America
Online a prime place on its Windows desktop screen, the most prized
real estate in computing.
</P>
<P>
   Even after the Netscape purchase was announced, Case and other
America Online executives insisted that the company would not
switch to the Netscape browser because Microsoft desktop placement
was too valuable to lose. That stance, Microsoft insists, will last
as long as the antitrust case does _ and no longer.
</P>
<P>
   But the Microsoft lawyers are mainly focused on exploring the
software plans of its rivals. At the time of the deal, Case spoke
of the long-range vision of being able to deliver his online
service through a ``new generation of Internet devices,'' including
pagers, cell phones and television set-top boxes.
</P>
<P>
   A crucial technology for realizing that future is Sun's Java, an
Internet programming language regarded as a major threat to
Microsoft's dominance.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the America Online strategy, according to executives close
to the company, also calls for its software, developed with Sun, to
play a central role in bringing it into new markets that compete
directly with Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   As the line between software and services blurs, America Online
wants its centralized hub computers to be able to ``serve'' Web
applications, like personal contacts, scheduling and spreadsheets,
onto users' screens at home or at work. These Web applications,
industry executives say, need not run on Windows and could replace
Microsoft's Office productivity software.
</P>
<P>
   Antitrust experts say documents detailing America Online's
ambitious plans may be most important in persuading the court not
to impose harsh sanctions against Microsoft, if it loses the case.
``The plans of these Microsoft rivals do not relate directly to the
case,'' said Carl Shapiro, a former senior official in the Justice
Department. ``Ambitious plans do not change the fact of Microsoft's
desktop monopoly and how it used it.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Shapiro said he expected Microsoft to use the deal
documents ``to bring alive for the judge the notion that this
high-tech landscape is changing and fluid, and that's not just
Microsoft's view.'' The Microsoft message, he said, will be that
``even if you think we cross the line, draconian measures are not
needed.''

UPROAR OVER USA NETWORKS-LYCOS DEAL MAY LEAD TO RETHINKING OF 
PORTAL CONCEPT
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DENISE CARUSO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whether or not shareholders ultimately bless or curse the
proposed merger of Lycos with Barry Diller's television shopping
company, USA Networks, the deal may well have catalyzed a
long-overdue rethinking of the business of Internet portals, those
launching pads from which millions of Web surfers rocket onto the
Internet each day.
</P>
<P>
   Until the announcement of the USA Networks-Lycos deal sent the
stock of both companies plummeting, Internet portals _ most of
which used to be known by the more nerdy term ``search engines'' _
had been the darlings of Internet-happy Wall Streeters,
stratospheric in their valuations.
</P>
<P>
   But even with most portal stocks holding their value, the
leaders of some of these companies now say their business needs
redefinition.
</P>
<P>
   The original idea was that the sheer numbers of visitors to
portals would draw advertisers, who needed to drive traffic to
their sites so that they, in turn, could sell advertising based on
traffic. As demand for ad space outstripped the available number of
Web pages at their sites, portal companies started bulking up with
news and contests, stock quotes and product promotions, shopping,
custom home pages and free e-mail _ just about anything they could
think of that would both create advertising space and keep the
largest number of users coming back.
</P>
<P>
   But now many portal executives are afraid the portal may become
the ``network television'' of the Internet by appealing to the
lowest common denominator. As a result, they are beginning to
question the value and the proper roles of content and services as
audience magnets. Some are also beginning to agree with early
critics who predicted that advertising would not be a viable
long-term business strategy for the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   They are even stepping up early to narrow the grandiose
expectations that electronic commerce _ like portals, part of a
long lineage of solutions in search of a problem _ will finally
kick the Internet into the high-gear global money machine we keep
waiting for.
</P>
<P>
   Search engines were of inestimable value in the early days of
the Web because they were the only way to find anything on the
Internet. Everybody used them; virtually all were free and heavily
trafficked.
</P>
<P>
   The portal concept was born, says Chan Suh, the chief executive
of Agency.com, when ``America Online did this brilliant thing _
they got Internet access and content, but all the links led to
things inside AOL.'' Opening a door into America Online, instead of
onto the global network, created a huge, measurable audience for
advertisers in search of eyeballs and made America Online the most
valuable commercial real estate in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   But Suh now asserts that portals have already seen their best
days.
</P>
<P>
   Like Suh, at least one portal executive believes that the
business is beginning to veer perilously close to the ways of a
dying medium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our biggest fear is becoming like TV networks, a commodity,''
George Bell, the chief executive of Excite Inc., said at a recent
industry conference. ``How do we avoid being seen as a commodity
distributor? How do we become more than a little bit of
everything?''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``We're taking generic content and reorganizing it''
under Excite's brand, but that idea is certainly not proprietary.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it proving particularly valuable to users, said Linda
McCutcheon, president of Time Inc. New Media. ``We're describing
assets, not consumer benefits,'' Ms. McCutcheon said of most
portals' attitudes about content. ``It's like getting in your car
and saying, `Honey, it's a beautiful day. Let's drive through the
Lincoln Tunnel.' ''
</P>
<P>
   If questioning the value of content were not heretical enough,
some portal purveyors are also sure that advertising itself, as it
is practiced today, is on its way out as a significant revenue
stream.
</P>
<P>
   ``Advertising won't carry the freight, because there's no reason
it should,'' Bell said. ``The Web does something different. It
interacts, and interactivity begets data. We should focus on direct
marketing, driven by personalization and away from the retail
chain.''
</P>
<P>
   This may prove trickier for portals like Excite, which does not
own anything it can sell, than it has been for sites like Time
Inc.'s Pathfinder and Viacom's MTV Online. Through the eyes of
these companies, which sell their own products through their
portals, it is even clearer that traditional Web advertising may
have seen its day.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the audience is there, we will be able to monetize them,''
said Matt Farber, president of MTV Online, using one of today's
favored buzzwords for turning a customer relationship into cash.
``Advertising becomes E-commerce.''
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line, Suh said, is that ``portals are dead.'' Search
engines and generic advertising and content, he said, are nearly
irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea that a lot of people had in the beginning of the Web
revolution is finally starting to gel a little bit,'' he said.
``People are inventing their own content. On discussion boards,
stock chat areas, family picture and discussion sites _ they've
invented content in ways they couldn't have before, and that is
going to be the most important thing for portals.''
</P>
<P>
   Which means the Web is in fact not a mass medium, but a medium
for the masses, who are already well along in the process of making
it their own.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bell, Diller and many others are already devising new
marketing stratagems to take advantage of this shift, it will be
fascinating to see who is willing to participate. Will people
inventing their own content welcome personalized marketing? Or will
most folks simply say, ``Monetize this''?

INDEPENDENT BOOKSELLERS PLAN TO OPEN ONLINE STORE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DOREEN CARVAJAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Facing intensifying competition, the nation's trade
association for independent booksellers is creating its own
national online store, Book Sense, to stave off fierce competition
from Amazon.com and Barnesandnoble.com.
</P>
<P>
   The online venture, which is scheduled to open for business this
summer, is the most ambitious element in a series of
countermeasures to promote independent bookstores by the American
Booksellers Association, the dominant trade group for a beleaguered
fraternity that has seen its share of the popular consumer book
market shrink to about 17 percent today from 32 percent in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Those pressures have continued to intensify with competition
from superstore chains and online bookstores, prompting some store
owners to abandon the business with bitter complaints that they are
under siege. The electronic bookstore and a planned national
marketing campaign are the first collective efforts of an
ordinarily disparate group of independents. The goals is to compete
against some of the forces that have reduced ABA membership to
about 3,300 from 5,200 in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not trying to knock off the Goliaths _ I don't want to
look naive,'' said Hut Landon, a bookstore owner in Mill Valley,
Calif., and the executive director of the Northern California
Independent Booksellers Association, which developed the pilot
concept last year. ``All we're trying to do is retain our market
share. We recognize that we've got to do this in this day and age.
We can't just be quaint little booksellers in our community asking
how the kids are.''
</P>
<P>
   The association already has organized a series of 12 customer
focus groups along with the development of the electronic
bookstore. In its initial stages, the store will feature all the
standard functions of popular online sites, including a search
engine, a stock of 1.5 million titles, credit card fulfillment,
gift wrapping, distribution services and a best-seller list. But it
will also allow individual stores to tailor Web pages to reflect
their individuality with store reviews and features.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're really trying to do is find the different ways that
we can do what our competitors are doing,'' said Michael F. Hoynes,
the association's newly hired marketing officer. He said initial
interest in the program was enthusiastic because booksellers have
been asking for a collective approach.
</P>
<P>
   The booksellers' association, based in Tarrytown, N.Y., will
begin its first national marketing campaign in May for the Book
Sense brand, which in some ways is inspired by the example of the
independent hardware stores that promote themselves under the True
Value label.
</P>
<P>
   The association plans to spend about $2 million to develop the
electronic bookstore and about $2 million more on the marketing
campaign _ money that comes in part from its half-share of $25
million that the association won from Penguin Group USA in a
dispute over favorable discounts that were given to large retail
bookstore chains.
</P>
<P>
   In Northern California, where there is a strong and active group
of independent booksellers, the regional association has also spent
about $100,000 to promote a common identity under the name Book
Sense. The brand and a slogan, ``Independent Bookstores for
Independent Minds,'' are appearing in newspaper advertisements and
on decals, posters, and plastic shopping bags in the Bay Area,
where more than 200 bookstores have signed up to participate in the
pilot program.
</P>
<P>
   But the collective approach envisioned by the national
association is broader in scope, conceivably allowing customers to
order books online with the freedom to pick up or return a book at
any participating Book Sense store. The association is already in
discussions with a national wholesaler, Baker &AMP; Taylor, to provide
distribution services, a critical element for an online service
that caters to customers with swift delivery. It is also
considering expanding the electronic title base to include
out-of-print books.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, the pricing system still is being determined,
although individual bookstore owners will have great flexibility to
offer discounts on their templates, said Len Vlahos, the
association's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Within the next few months, the association will start signing
up members to participate in the electronic project, which would
cost bookstore owners monthly development fees expected to range
from $175 to $450.

<P>
   Several technology analysts said that the move was a vital step
to protect the booksellers eroding turf, and noted that the
independents may be able to capitalize on strengths in ways that
Amazon.com and Barnes &AMP; Noble cannot.
</P>
<P>
   David Brodwin, an associate partner with Andersen Consulting who
follows electronic commerce, said the Book Sense venture would draw
on the loyalty of customers who prefer local bookstores over
corporations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Independents will feature locally relevant information _
travel, restaurant guides, local history _ with a degree of
sophistication and connoisseurship that the nationwide players may
have trouble matching,'' Brodwin said. He cautioned, though, that
associations often move slowly. That could present problems for
success in electronic commerce, which requires decisiveness and
speed.
</P>
<P>
   Kate Delhagen, the director of online retail strategies for
Forrester Research Inc., a technology research company, said that
independent booksellers had no choice but to act because customers'
shopping habits were changing.
</P>
<P>
   Forrester projects that almost $1.2 billion in book purchases
will be made online this year, she said. Spending will rise in 2003
to almost $3 billion, or about 18 percent of the book market, she
added.
</P>
<P>
   ``The book lover in me is thrilled to hear about this for the
independents,'' Ms. Delhagen said. ``Banding together and forming a
network is the only way. This is a huge opportunity for them to
survive, because long term, they're getting eviscerated. There is
an option now rather than shuttering their stores. This development
presents them with an opportunity to say, `I'm sticking around, and
we're not letting Amazon and Barnes &AMP; Noble run us out of town.'''

   Toddlers practice coloring inside the lines on computer
workstations at a Queens public library, their feet dangling
because the chairs are too high. Fourth graders in Westchester
County check stock quotations on the Internet, arching their necks
at mom or dad's computer, to complete a homework assignment about
investing.
</P>
<P>
   At a public school in upper Manhattan, students balance
keyboards on their knees because there is no room in front of the
monitors. And at an after-school computer center on the Upper West
Side of Manhattan, children brush up on spelling with their arms
stretched taut toward the keyboard and their fingers clenched
around the mouse.
</P>
<P>
   These boys and girls are the first generation of American
children to learn computing along with colors and ABCs. And they
are coming of age at a time when the nation's elected leaders, from
the White House to the local school board, are calling for a
computer on every desk by the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
   But in the rush to bring all the latest technology to every
child in the nation, experts say there have been virtually no
efforts to ensure that children have appropriate equipment and
furniture, and proper training in posture and keyboard technique.
</P>
<P>
   While experts said they could not predict the level of future
problems among children, there is wide concern among physicians,
physical therapists and ergonomists that a tide of injuries,
mirroring those sustained by adults in certain professions, is
inevitable as young people spend more time on computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time somebody paid attention,'' said Jane M. Healy, an
educational psychologist who spent more than two years watching
children working on computers while she researched a book,
``Failure To Connect (Simon &AMP; Schuster, 1998). ``What I saw, all
over the country, was just appalling.''
</P>
<P>
   There is only the most embryonic research about whether children
are vulnerable to the repetitive stress injuries that have
afflicted 20 million American adults, making such disorders the No.
1 workplace injury in America. To date, only one study on computer
workstations and children has been published in the United States,
in last month's issue of the journal Computers in the Schools.
</P>
<P>
   In that study, a team of researchers from Cornell University
observed third, fourth and fifth graders and found a ``striking
misfit'' between the children and the equipment and a ``marked lack
of attention and commitment'' to correcting the problem.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, all the children worked with craned necks, hunched
shoulders or flexed wrists. The researchers concluded that at least
4 in 10 were at risk of serious injury.
</P>
<P>
   Relying on such early research, and extrapolating from the
well-documented experience of adults, about two dozen experts
interviewed said they believed that risks to children would
multiply as society and schools became more computerized.
</P>
<P>
   They said that with at least 70 percent of America's 30 million
elementary school students already using computers _ at school, at
home or both _ many children could suffer sore wrists, tingling
fingers, aching backs or worse if they failed to practice safe
habits.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think children play with computers, they don't work
with computers,'' said Alan Hedge, one of the Cornell researchers.
``But there is no reason to assume that what happened to adults
won't happen to children, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Several designers of software and hardware said they had
received no reports of children injured from computing and did not
want to overstate the risks. While their own observations, part of
the development of new products, suggested that a problem was
brewing, they said that only proper research could determine its
extent.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me this situation cries out for a systematic assessment,''
said Erik Strommen, who heads the research and design group for
children's products at Microsoft. ``And the simplest thing to do in
the meantime is be guided by what we know about adults.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   By all accounts, children who have already sought treatment have
been injured playing games, like Nintendo, which require a steady
pounding of controls with thumbs and mesmerize children in awkward
postures in front of television screens for hours.
</P>
<P>
   Ergonomists have already observed children, despite their
flexible young bodies, rubbing their hands and shrugging kinks out
of their shoulders as they work at computers.
</P>
<P>
   And as educational software evolves, experts said, the programs,
too, could rivet the attention of young people who would otherwise
be squirming and thus naturally protecting themselves from injuries
caused, in part, by long motionless periods in contorted postures.
</P>
<P>
   One child entranced by this emerging software is 4-year-old
Claudia Martinez, who craned her head toward the screen one recent
afternoon as she worked at a program called Kendra's Coloring Book
at the new $35 million public library in Flushing, Queens.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother watched proudly, saying she was unconcerned by the
girl's awkward pose, but disappointed that she was limited to 20
minutes during busy hours. Ruth Herzberg, the branch manager,
boasted about the computer skills Claudia was learning, taking no
note of her poor posture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at how her attention's not diverted at all,'' Ms.
Herzberg said. ``Usually a child that age is not good at
concentrating.''
</P>
<P>
   Parents and educators are not willfully ignoring the health
risks of poor computing habits, experts say. It is more that they
are preoccupied with the educational opportunities of the
burgeoning technology.
</P>
<P>
   That attitude is widespread even among those who are teaching
children computer skills and installing equipment in schools.
</P>
<P>
   At Score, an Upper West Side after-school computer center, there
are adjustable chairs, but nobody adjusts them, even for toddlers.
``I never thought of it,'' said Jaime Rissin, one of the peppy
young instructors who reward each completed lesson with a
high-five.
</P>
<P>
   At Dow's Lane Elementary School in suburban Irvington, N.Y.,
where the Board of Education recently embarked on a $1
million-a-year technology initiative, every classroom is to be
equipped with high-speed T-1 telecommunications lines, digital
cameras and color scanners. But children still work at the
computers in old-fashioned library chairs at one-size-fits-all
tables.
</P>
<P>
   ``It never dawned on me,'' said Don Beverly, the district's
technology director, ``and that's the gut truth. But we will look
at that in the future, before it gets to be a liability issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Even when guidance is offered, it is sometimes rebuffed. Karen
Jacobs, president of the American Occupational Therapy Association,
taught classes in ``healthy computing'' at her daughter's middle
school in a Boston suburb, showing 600 children how to stretch,
take frequent breaks and make their workstations more comfortable
by sitting on dictionaries, stuffing gym shorts to cushion the
smalls of their backs and using their backpacks as footrests.
</P>
<P>
   But when she sent fliers to parents offering free consultations
on modifying home workstations, she got no responses. ``Parents are
more concerned with how fast they can get on the Internet, whether
they have the right math games,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jacobs recommends makeshift solutions that do not
necessarily include fancy equipment, which is financially out of
reach of many families and school districts. In New York City, for
example, where school buildings are literally crumbling, adjustable
desks and chairs are not high on anybody's agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are into very basic stuff,'' said Philip Russo, a spokesman
for the Board of Education. ``Safe, warm and dry _ that's the
mantra.''
</P>
<P>
   But experts said that some basic ergonomic training would be a
cost-efficient intervention with children that might prevent
injuries as they moved on to college and jobs. School officials
interviewed agreed that such training would be a good idea. But
they remain focused on teaching both staff members and students how
to use the programs on their new computers.
</P>
<P>
   The Irvington teachers, for example, are offered seminars in
desktop publishing and PowerPoint presentations, but none in
ergonomic training. Likewise, the students, 75 percent of whom are
also online at home, are taught to search the Internet for
documents from the Colonial era and to e-mail scientists at the
Bronx Zoo, but not to stretch and to rest.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few small efforts to teach safe computing to
children. On the Web site of the American Occupational Therapy
Association, parents can download screen-savers with safety
instructions. And the Garnett Foundation in Burlingame, Calif.,
which runs programs to interest girls in technology careers,
distributes mouse pads with illustrations of good computer posture.
</P>
<P>
   There are also specialty products, including touch-screens to
avoid mice or joysticks, large track balls for little hands and
software that reminds users to take a break.
</P>
<P>
   But experts say that ergonomic training and specialized
equipment are half measures without follow-up at home by parents.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jacobs' 30-minute classes at the Andover West Middle School,
for example, bore only temporary fruit, according to her
12-year-old daughter, Ariel. ``For a little while they were doing
the things my mom taught them, and then they forgot about it,''
Ariel said.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest difference parents can make, experts say, is in
limiting the hours children spend on computers. In some households,
children boot up before breakfast and again at 3 p.m., remaining
online until bedtime. In other households, computer time is
rationed along with television, which has been documented as having
adverse effects on children.
</P>
<P>
   And the range of parental approaches is just as wide among
ergonomists.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Gillespie, an ergonomic consultant and graduate student at
New York University, permits no computing at home for her
6-year-old son and cringes at the notion that children are playing
Legos on the screen instead of on the living room rug.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not an actual Luddite,'' Ms. Gillespie said. ``But my gut
feeling is kids don't need to use computers to be smart.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Ms. Jacobs' 14-year-old son, Josh, is a computer
junkie. On school days, he is online for about three hours, and on
weekends the monitor never goes dark. He gossips with friends on
America Online. He surfs the Net. He downloads games.
</P>
<P>
   But Josh is confident that he is not hurting himself because he
has a cordless keyboard that allows him to roam while he types,
rather than sit motionless in a chair. ``I can walk around while
I'm typing and lie in bed so my back and neck don't hurt,'' he
said. ``My mom thinks it's great.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe. ``Did he say he does it in bed a lot?'' Ms. Jacobs
asked. ``I'll have to watch him more closely.''

LUCK OF THE IRISH BEGINS AT BREAKFAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RUTH FANTASIA  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whoever started the rumor that the Irish can't cook apparently
never had an Ulster Fry. More commonly known as an Irish breakfast,
the traditional ``fry'' is nothing less than a massive assortment
of food piled on a plate and historically served up with a spot of
tea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Breakfast was the big meal of the day,'' said Harold Qualters,
the great-grandson of Irish immigrants who is now general manager
of the Troy Pub &AMP; Brewery in Troy, N.Y. ``People think of it as
staple, hard-working and lacking in refinement, but it was an
honest and healthy meal.''
</P>
<P>
   More healthful in fact than today's morning fare.
</P>
<P>
   The typical Ulster Fry contains a fried egg, two bangers, two
rashers, two slices each of black and white puddings, scones or
potato farls, a couple of sauteed mushrooms and a slice or two of
roasted tomato. If everything except the egg, mushrooms and tomato
sound a little foreign, here's a brief primer on Irish cuisine:
</P>
<P>
   _ Bangers: Ireland's version of sausages. These links of ground
pork are much leaner than American sausages and lack the sage and
other spices that flavor our version. They fry to a rich golden
brown color, leaving very little fat in the pan.
</P>
<P>
   _ Rashers: Instead of bacon, the Irish fry up thin slices of
boneless pork loin. Again, less fat than Americans usually eat.
</P>
<P>
   _ Potato farls: These, Qualters said, are a bit like Irish soda
bread but made into rolls instead of a loaf.
</P>
<P>
   _ White pudding and black pudding: Puddings in the British Isles
are not the custard-like mixtures we're used to. Irish white
breakfast pudding is a mixture of ground pork, oatmeal and
flavorings formed into a roll and steamed.
</P>
<P>
   _ Black pudding (WARNING! Here's where people get a little
squeamish) is colored and flavored with the blood of pigs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a breakfast to keep you going until lunch,'' said
Qualters.
</P>
<P>
   And the Irish have a tradition of making more food than is
needed for any meal. Perhaps it's because in ancient times, Brehon
Law decreed that strangers were to be fed and entertained by Irish
families, regardless of the family's economic stature. At mealtime,
the front door was left open to welcome travelers, according to
Bord Bia, promoters of Irish food exports.
</P>
<P>
   From the humble, yet hearty beginnings of the Ulster Fry, Irish
breakfasts have evolved into more sophisticated fare. Qualters, who
ran an Albany restaurant that featured Irish breakfasts, served up
a dish he called Celtic Eggs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was similar to a typical rarebit (cheese sauce on an
English muffin), but scones made with green onions took the place
of the English muffin. The scones were topped with a rasher of
Irish bacon, a poached egg and a cheese sauce made from Blarney
cheese and Harps (Irish made beer),'' Qualters said.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, Qualters substituted just poached salmon (revered in
Irish mythology as a source of wisdom) for the rasher and
Hollandaise sauce with chives and capers for the cheese sauce. A
lighter, yet still hearty meal. Other Irish mornings included items
such as Potatoes O'Brien (fried spuds with onions and red and green
peppers) cooked into an omelet with Blarney cheese. Or, even
simpler, a breakfast of scrambled eggs, salmon and scones.
</P>
<P>
   So, next time you think the Irish can't cook, look in your
pantry and count the number of cereal boxes you have. Then think of
the Ulster Fry.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BUTTERMILK SCONES
</P>
<P>
   (Serves 4 to 6)
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons baking powder
</P>
<P>
   1 cup buttermilk, divided
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon baking soda
</P>
<P>
   2 1/2 cups unbleached flour
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   Heat oven to 400. Lightly coat a baking sheet with cooking
spray. Stir the baking powder into a little of the buttermilk to
dissolve. Mix the baking soda, flour and remaining buttermilk using
a wooden spoon. Add the salt and baking powder solution and mix
thoroughly. Roll out dough on a lightly floured surface and cut
into scones, about 2 inches in diameter. (Recipe makes 12 to 15
scones.) Place on prepared baking sheet and bake for 15 minutes or
until lightly browned. Split the scones, spread with lashings of
butter and serve hot.
</P>
<P>
   (Note: According to the author, ``lashings means liberal
quantities, some where between oodles and scads.'' Source: ``Irish
Country Cooking'' by Malachi McCormick, Clarkson Potter, 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Though not as interesting as Qualters' cheese sauce made with
beer, this recipe will suffice when making Celtic eggs at home.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CHEESE SAUCE
</P>
<P>
   (Serves 4)
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon margarine
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon butter
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 cups milk, warmed
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 cups grated Blarney cheese (see note)
</P>
<P>
   Melt butter in a medium saucepan. Add flour, salt and pepper and
stir to mix thoroughly. Gradually pour in warmed milk and, stirring
constantly, bring mixture to a rolling boil. Add in cheese and stir
until cheese is melted and mixture is smooth.
</P>
<P>
   (Note: Blarney cheese is a semi-hard Irish-made cheese. If
desired, substitute a good Finlandia Swiss or shredded cheddar
cheese.)

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
Junk e-mail a way of life, but you have a few defenses 
By Bill Husted  
c. 1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   I'll never forget the thrill I felt when I opened my first
e-mail. Maybe it's strange to feel nostalgic about something that
is theoretically as neutral as computer bytes. But turns out that
Marshall McLuhan was wrong as far as I'm concerned. The message is
the message, and it's the content that matters, not how it arrives.
</P>
<P>
   I still love e-mail when it comes from a friend. But so much of
it is true junk, and I delete that unread. Nowadays the junk
outnumbers the good mail.
</P>
<P>
   Readers often write me, thinking I have some secret method of
shielding them from the invasion that arrives daily in the mailbox
when they log on. Truth is, I can't stop it from coming to my own
mailbox, and if I could come up with a good method of doing that, I
would be a saner man.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few ways to control junk mail, but some of them are
counterintuitive.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, you probably have received unsolicited e-mail that
has a helpful note at the bottom offering to remove you from the
mailing list if you'll just ask for that to be done. Sometimes this
is a sincere offer from an ethical merchant. Other times it is a
trick to authenticate your e-mail address.
</P>
<P>
   In some mass mailings, the whole notion is to get you to
respond. Once you've responded, your e-mail address commands a
premium price among the e-mail list peddlers. You've just raised
your hand and said, in effect: Yes, I'm here, and the address
works.
</P>
<P>
   So what's a person to do?
</P>
<P>
   Truth is, there isn't a heck of a lot you can do to protect
yourself against the really unethical mailers. These people care
only about profiting from your name. But there are a few steps you
can take to diminish the amount of junk that arrives. Here's a
start:
</P>
<P>
   _ Check with your Internet provider and ask if it offers any
system for filtering out junk mail. These junk mail filters use
various schemes, but most look for the addresses of known junk
mailers. If it's offered, use it. These systems won't eliminate the
junk but will reduce its volume.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you leave public messages on the Internet, you can avoid
using your real address. Some people change the return address on
their account to fool automatic software that harvests e-mail
addresses from postings in almost the same way thresher machines
harvest grain on the farm. For instance, if your real e-mail
address is bhusted(at)ajc.com, it can be changed to
bhusted(at)spamfilter.ajc.com. People who understand e-mail will
figure out what you're doing, but the automatic software will be
fooled and any mail sent to you will go astray. (The downside of
this method is that many Internet users whom you might legitimately
want to hear from also will be fooled, so I don't recommend it
unless you understand that you might also miss some real mail this
way.)
</P>
<P>
   _ Unless you just can't stand it, avoid registering at Web sites
for free gifts and informational mailings offered by some sites.
That puts your e-mail address in the basket to be swapped, sold and
abused.
</P>
<P>
   _ Write your Internet provider and ask that it take any steps it
can to protect you from junk e-mail. While there aren't many things
the provider can do to help at this stage, it's good to register
your indignation since you are something truly valuable to them: a
customer. A groundswell of disapproval will register if the ISPs
has to decide whether to seek or back legislation to control junk
e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   _ Finally, keep your sense of humor about all this (I cannot
always obey my own advice, by the way). Just as the paper variety
of junk mail will continue to arrive in your mailbox at home, junk
e-mail is a fact of life. Open an e-mail account, and it will come.
</P>

cannot respond to all e-mail. Personal home page:

Web can help harried parents with science projects 
By Jennifer Hill  
c. 1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Each spring, I dread the month of March, because March brings
with it the Science Fair project, which can turn the knees of a
strong, normally capable parent into jelly, especially one with
multiple children, which usually means multiple projects.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily for me and other Science Fair-impaired parents, there's
the Internet, which can be the starting point to a more meaningful
project, or least some good ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Using a search engine such as Yahoo! or Excite and the words
``science fair project,'' or on America Online, ``Science Fair
Central,'' you can quickly find a wealth of resources.
</P>
<P>
   At http://www.eduzone.com
</P>
<P>
   /Tips/Science/SHOWTIP2.HTM, there's a site with the catchy title
``No More Clay Volcanoes: Your 1999 Science Fair.'' It gives a
straightforward, text-only step-by-step guide, which can make a
handy reference guide as your budding scientist selects and puts
together a project. Not surprisingly, the site's author notes that
the most successful projects are those in which a student is
genuinely interested. This site is part of a larger site called
Room 103, which answers science and technology questions.
</P>
<P>
   The Ultimate Science Fair Project is a giant umbrella site that
includes multiple pages with ideas, idea links and writing hints.
The idea generation page (http://www.isd77.k12.mn
</P>
<P>
   .us/resources/cf/ideas.html) includes a worksheet that poses
questions with suggested topics to insert in the blanks that help
get a student's mind thinking properly about how to select a
project. Below is an example taken from the page:
</P>
<P>
   _ What is the effect of on ?
</P>
<P>
   detergentgermination of seeds
</P>
<P>
   temperaturethe volume of air
</P>
<P>
   _ How/to what extent does the affect ?
</P>
<P>
   humiditygrowth of fungi
</P>
<P>
   color of a materialits absorption of heat
</P>
<P>
   The Internet can also be used to compile a non-Internet resource
list. The names of several science publications as well other
resources can be found at
http://www.ipl.org/youth/projectguide/mags. Hyperlinks on the page
will take you to the online version of the publication.
</P>
<P>
   The research resources listed on this page, such as the
dictionary, are good, but may be difficult for young children to
navigate. And in the case of NASA, the recommended thesaurus costs
money. The MerriamWebster site (http://www.m-w.com
</P>
<P>
   /dictionary.htm), while offering less depth in the definitions,
is free and easier to navigate.
</P>
<P>
   And as we discovered, digital information takes many forms. We
now take extra care when feeding one subject of my son's project.
For on the Internet, we discovered a handy fact _ African bullfrogs
will gladly bite, and eat, the fingers of the hand that feeds them.

Snap launches site about Holocaust 
(Eds: Sunday night means 3/14.) 
By Frances Katz  
c. 1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Somewhere at the intersection of commerce and content, Web
portal Snap found itself a conscience.
</P>
<P>
   The NBC/CNet-owned Web portal has launched its extensive
Holocaust Resource Center to coincide with NBC's airing of the
Steven Spielberg film ``Schindler's List'' on Sunday night. Users
who want to access the resource center should go to
http://www.snap.com and type in ``holocaust'' in the search box.
</P>
<P>
   The Holocaust Resource Center is a well-organized site built to
help educate viewers about the Holocaust and help promote
Spielberg's nonprofit Shoah foundation, which documents stories of
Holocaust survivors.
</P>
<P>
   It is not a pleasant experience. Categories such as
``concentration camps'' aren't easy to click on, and an eerie sense
of gloom pervades.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the kind of thing that's designed to drive
traffic,'' says Edmond Sanctis, Snap's chief operating officer.
``The film is incredibly powerful and an important film. From our
perspective, it's something we are proud to be associated with as a
company.''
</P>
<P>
   Snap, like its portal competitors Yahoo!, Lycos, Exite and
Netscape's NetCenter, has been unabashedly about commerce and
utility. The site has the usual assortment of sports scores, stock
quotes, shopping and e-mail ``sticky products'' designed more for
utility and return visits than anything else. In the portal arena,
where ``sticky products'' are everything, a site devoted to
commemorating horrific acts of human cruelty and suffering is no
sticky product.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's true most of our messaging to the public has been
whimsical and practical ways to be useful and have fun,'' says Snap
Executive Producer Katharine English. ``But we are all information
junkies anyway; this was a chance to bubble up to the challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   English says Snap and other portals in the business of
collecting and organizing information are the ideal companies to
build informational and educational sites for users that don't
necessarily have anything to do with selling books or NCAA Final
Four pools.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what the Internet does best,'' she says. ``Think about
how much information you can access _ it's awesome. It's
overpowering. But the days of feeling awed by the power of
information have largely waxed and waned in the age of commerce and
utility and giant corporate mergers. But all this information
hasn't gone away. Look at the number of new sites that launch every
day. The Internet isn't just about mergers and stock quotes.''
</P>
<P>
   English says content is what drives the Web, though new users
probably don't know that yet. ``People who are coming online today
think it's all about e-mail and gaming, but it's not. It's about
accessing rich, deep areas of Internet information.''
</P>
<P>
   English is right. Before portals were all about news, weather,
sports and shopping, they were simple ``search engines'' that
helped Web surfers hunt down the volumes of information on the Web
they could never locate on their own.
</P>
<P>
   It is true the Holocaust Resource Center isn't going to draw as
much traffic as ESPN SportsZone, GeoCities or even Mr. Showbiz, but
Snap doesn't care. The company says this is an opportunity to
gather its resources and use them to help educate and inform Web
surfers who are moved by the film and want to learn more.
</P>
<P>
   However, everyone at Snap is quick to say this isn't a publicity
stunt or a gimmick to get viewers to leave their TVs and log on to
Snap. The site will be up long after the movie has aired and will
remain a resource on the site indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we get some mileage from this on air, that's great, but
that's not why we did it,'' English says. ``It's really about
bringing to the front the kind of work this team does every day
that isn't that high profile and raising awareness to the Shoah
Foundation in another venue _ online. When you stop to think about
it, we're all so commerce-driven here in Silicon Alley start-up
land. More people think of their stock options rather than teaching
kids to read.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's an opportunity to give people access to information
they never had before. This is where the Internet is really alive.
Somebody took the time to assemble this information,'' adds
English. ``This is also where the power of convergence of TV and
online media really manifests. We have the opportunity to drive
people to television and tell them to watch this very important
film based on a true story.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are probably hundreds of thousands of people who have no
idea who Oskar Schindler is. But if they have been touched by the
power of this painful yet uplifting kind of story, it doesn't have
to end for them there. They can go online and take it a step
further and find a place to get involved or try to understand how
something like this could have happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``People always talk about convergence, but from my perspective
this is just the beginning. It's our opportunity to weave this
information into users' minds,'' English says. ``It should be
people like us (who build these sites). ``We have access to this
information. It shouldn't be buried; it should be high profile.''

PalmPilot-Mac software improved 
By Charles Haddad  
c. 1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It has been a long time coming but apparently worth the wait. At
least that is the initial review coming from the Internet about
3Com's new Mac software for its PalmPilot line of hand-held
computers.
</P>
<P>
   Called MacPac 2.1, this software lets you back up and
synchronize your PalmPilot data on a Mac. It has been hailed so far
as a lean package that runs fast and offers some innovative
features.
</P>
<P>
   ``After seeing MacPac, some Windows users told me they will
switch to the Mac so they can use our software,'' Doug Wirnowski,
PalmPilot product manager, recently told trade news magazine
MacWeek.
</P>
<P>
   The MacPac is great news for the Mac community. The PalmPilot,
which has sold more than 2 million units in the past several years,
is the only hand-held computer that lets you back up and
synchronize personal information on a Mac.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, though, the synchronization software for the Mac
paled in comparison with its Windows counterpart for the PalmPilot.
</P>
<P>
   No longer. What 3Com did was take the old Claris Organizer,
which was a excellent personal information manager, and retool it
for the PalmPilot. But 3Com has done more than just translate
Organizer to the PalmPilot. It has actually improved on the old
software.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, Organizer as MacPac 2.1 synchronizes some data in
only 11 seconds, according to 3Com tests.
</P>
<P>
   You can also install applications for the PalmPilot through
drag-and-drop technology. That is, you just drag an icon of the
application onto an icon of the PalmPilot on your desktop for
installation.
</P>
<P>
   Another nifty new feature is the addition of AppleScript, which
lets users customize their Macs. Now you can do this, too, on the
PalmPilot. For example, you could program your PalmPilot to back up
certain files every day at a specific time.
</P>
<P>
   With MacPac 2.1, the PalmPilot can now communicate with an iMac,
Apple's hottest-selling new computer.
</P>
<P>
   MacPac 2.1 is available online at 3Com's site, in stores and in
catalogs. It retails for $15. The computer CD also includes other
software, such as Adobe Acrobat Reader and the basic version of
Shana's Expense Creator program.

Astronomy sites offer assistance in searching night sky 
By Bill Husted  
c. 1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For many people, the answers are in the stars.
</P>
<P>
   Forget horoscopes and the Academy Awards and go outside tonight
and look up. Those little sparkling points of light _ the stars _
and those larger lights that do not twinkle _ the planets _ have
provided answers and beauty since the first humans walked the
Earth.
</P>
<P>
   To learn about them and enjoy them, you need nothing more than
your eyes and mind (if you throw in your heart, they'll be even
more beautiful). In fact, most astronomers recommend that novices
postpone buying a telescope and spend some time just observing
using the naked eye or binoculars and a good star chart. A star
chart is simply a map of the skies that helps you find and identify
the larger objects.
</P>
<P>
   You'll find many useful resources on the Internet. While you'll
eventually want to buy a star chart, you can get online help
locating objects in the sky at a page called Stig's Sky Calendar at
http://www.skycalendar.com
</P>
<P>
   /skycal/index.html. (If you use a search engine, you'll find
several charts of the night sky on the Net).
</P>
<P>
   Now that you know what it'll take to get started, you'll want to
read a little bit about astronomy. In this case, too, you'll
eventually want a good book for beginners. But you can find plenty
of information online. Let's start with the Beginner's Guide to
Naked Eye Astronomy at http://user.icx
</P>
<P>
   .net/(tilde)ngc457/nakedeye.htm. You'll learn the basics that
can make watching the skies more enjoyable.
</P>
<P>
   Continue your education by hitting the back button on your
browser to go to a more general section of The Beginners Guide (or
simply type in http://user.icx
</P>
<P>
   .net/(tilde)ngc457/beginner.htm). This page offers all sorts of
useful information _ everything from star charts, to advice on
selecting a telescope or pair of binoculars, to articles that will
help you identify the constellations. Knowing the constellations is
a great help, since you can use them as landmarks to the rest of
the wonders of the sky. Since it's fairly easy to recognize the
major constellations, you'll save a lot of time as you search the
skies.
</P>
<P>
   If your interest in astronomy continues, a couple of things are
likely to happen. You'll eventually want a telescope, and you'll
also have questions about astronomy that aren't answered in the
books you own or the Web pages you find.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet can help in both areas.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with the search for a good telescope. Let's suppose
you don't have an unlimited cache of money. There's a terrific page
called How to Choose a Quality Telescope for Under $500 at
http://www.eecs.uic.edu
</P>
<P>
   /(tilde)dlent/btel.html. This site is exceptional because it
literally leads you by the hand in a series of pages that begin
with explaining the basics of the optics telescopes use. You'll
learn there is more than one type of telescope and find out about
the advantages and disadvantages of each type. Finally, after your
education is complete, you'll wind up on a page that gives you
addresses for some reputable companies that sell telescopes. One
bit of advice to take to heart: Avoid any telescope that costs less
than $100. The optics will be so bad you'll be better off using
your naked eyes or binoculars.
</P>
<P>
   Now let's find some places where you can get direct answers to
your questions. Several astronomy groups offer this service
including: Curious About Astronomy? Ask an Astronomer at
http://astrosun.tn.cornell.edu
</P>
<P>
   /students/kornreich/curious
</P>
<P>

A VIRUS BY ANY OTHER NAME IS STILL TROUBLE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DAVID HOYE   
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Ack! I've been attacked by a killer Trojan worm!
</P>
<P>
   Yes, you read that right. We consumers would call it a virus.
But experts in Computing Land say the correct term is either
``Trojan'' or ``worm.'' (I added the ``killer'' part for fun!)
</P>
<P>
   It all started with an innocent session at the computer. I sat
down, signed online and checked my e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   I get a lot of e-mail, and many times the messages come with
attachments, such as electronic greeting cards or press releases
sent as Word documents.
</P>
<P>
   So I wasn't surprised to see an e-mail waiting for me that
carried an attached file. This one was a small executable program
called ``happy99.exe.''
</P>
<P>
   I detached the file and, just to be safe, scanned it with my
anti-virus software. ``No viruses detected,'' came the message a
couple seconds later.
</P>
<P>
   So, being the trusting individual that I am, I went ahead and
double-clicked happy99.exe. A window opened and I was treated to a
rather nice display of fireworks shooting skyward and exploding.
</P>
<P>
   OK, enough of that, I thought. I closed the window and deleted
happy99.exe.
</P>
<P>
   Or so I thought.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't give it another thought until late Monday, when I again
checked my e-mail. There was an automated message from a City of
Phoenix computer informing me that a message I'd sent to a city
employee had been killed before it was delivered because it
contained a virus.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't know what to make of such an e-mail. But to see what
was happening, I sent myself a test e-mail. Soon it arrived in my
e-mail box. Guess what was attached? You got it. A copy of
happy99.exe.
</P>
<P>
   That's when I hit the Internet, and conducted a search using the
term ``happy99.exe.''
</P>
<P>
   As I quickly learned, this isn't just a fireworks display. This
``Trojan'' or ``worm'' program digs into computer systems, renames
itself and changes settings. Then, each time the infected system is
used to send e-mail or post newsgroup messages, the Trojan/worm
attaches a copy of happy99.exe to the outgoing message.
</P>
<P>
   And all this takes place without the user of the infected system
ever knowing _ unless someone or something (like a city of Phoenix
computer) bonks them over the head and says, in effect, ``Stop
spreading that stupid program!''
</P>
<P>
   Both Symantec, the maker of Norton Anti Virus software, and Data
Fellows call happy99.exe a ``worm.'' Others argue that it's a
``Trojan.'' All seem to agree it's not a ``virus.''
</P>
<P>
   Generally speaking, a virus is a program that can replicate
itself, can cause damage to computer systems and networks and can
attach itself to other programs. A Trojan is a type of virus that
masquerades as a benign application, but doesn't replicate itself.
A worm is a type of virus that can replicate itself but cannot
attach itself to other programs.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever you call it, happy99.exe is a pain.
</P>
<P>
   I believe happy99.exe first reared its ugly head in January.
Reliable documents describing its existance and how to rid it from
infected systems didn't begin appearing online until February.
</P>
<P>
   If, in fact, happy99.exe is just weeks old, that would explain
why my anti-virus software failed to detect it. To keep up with all
the new viruses, anti-virus software must be updated, something I
hadn't done since October.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, several Web sites include instructions for manually
removing happy99.exe from infected systems. The one I used is at
www.symantec.com/avcenter/venc/data/happy99.worm.html.
</P>
<P>
   I followed the instructions and removed happy99.exe from my
system. Then I purchased and downloaded a new anti-virus program,
which I immediately updated. When it ran, it discovered and deleted
a piece of happy99.exe that I had missed.
</P>
<P>
   Then I sent e-mails with warnings to people I thought might have
received copies of happy99.exe from me between the initial
infection of my system and the discovery of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   What a nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   By now, you may be wondering if your system is infected. If so,
send yourself an e-mail to see if anything comes attached.
(Obviously, this will work only if your e-mail service allows you
to receive attachments.) You also can conduct a file search of your
hard drive. If you find happy99.exe, ska.exe, ska.dll or
wsock32.ska, you got it, baby!
</P>
<P>
   And, if anybody sends you e-mail with happy99.exe as an
attachment, just delete it. The havoc occurs only if you execute
the file by double-clicking it. If you see the fireworks window,
you've gone too far, and have infected your system.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, I've learned my lesson: It's not enough to use
anti-virus software. You must keep it updated. And be careful with
those attachments. &QL; 
Is no privacy a bug?
</P>
<P>
   By now you've probably heard about the privacy flap concerning
the new Intel Pentium III chip. The computing world flew into a
tizzy when it was discovered that an identifier on every Pentium
III could be used to track computer users online.
</P>
<P>
   The latest big ``privacy oops'' comes from Microsoft. It seems
as though the software giant's popular Office 97 software suite
inserts a type of serial number in electronic documents. And the
number, the company recently admitted, can be used to trace
authorship and other personal information.
</P>
<P>
   Late last week, amid a flurry of complaints much like those
endured by Intel, Microsoft announced it planned to offer a
software patch that will prevent Office 97 programs from quietly
adding the identifying number to electronic documents.
</P>
<P>
   A software patch? Patches are usually created and distributed to
fix software glitches, or bugs. And bugs are accidental software
problems that are unintended and unwanted. &QL; 
Apple: Read all about it
</P>
<P>
   A new book is due out this month that details the history, warts
and all, of Apple Computer.
</P>
<P>
   The $17.95 book, ``Apple Confidential _ The Real Story of Apple
Computer Inc.,'' was written by San Francisco freelance writer Owen
Linzmayer and published by No Starch Press.
</P>
<P>
   Apple enthusiasts will recognize Linzmayer's name. He's covered
Apple since 1980, has written articles for just about every major
Macintosh publication and writes a column for ``MacAddict''
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   If you've always wanted to read about Apple, from its humble
roots to last year's blockbuster turnaround thanks to the hugely
popular iMac, this would be a great place to start.
</P>
<P>
   Linzmayer details how Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak started
Apple, how a ``forgotten founder'' walked away from the company and
gave up hundreds of millions of dollars, how Microsoft's dominance
of the software and computing industries affected the company, how
it fared under a variety of chief executive officers and much, much
more.
</P>
<P>
   The book is full of basic facts anyone will appreciate. But it's
also full of interesting extras that Apple fanatics should love.
</P>
<P>
   For example, it has several pages of ``Apple insiders'' who
helped launch the company. The list includes what they did and
where they are now. Interestingly, it also displays their actual
signatures, which were chemically etched inside early Macintosh
computers. This was done because Jobs believed the machine was a
piece of art.
</P>
<P>
   So, check out ``Apple Confidential'' if you get a chance. I
found the book well worth the purchase price. &QL;

STATES PREPARING REMEDIES IN CASE OF WIN IN MICROSOFT CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Flush with optimism about the way their case is
progressing, the 19 state attorneys general who joined the federal
government in the landmark antitrust suit against Microsoft Corp.
say they will not be satisfied, should they win the case, with any
remedy that does not revamp the company.
</P>
<P>
   No specifics have been decided about how that should be done _
and probably none will be until the judge issues his ruling this
summer. But as equal partners in the lawsuit, the states hold
something of a veto power over the kinds of remedies the federal
government can recommend, and the offices of the attorneys general
are alive with discussion of the various options.
</P>
<P>
   The one receiving the most favor right now would force Microsoft
to license the source code for the Windows operating system to
several other companies _ instantly creating competition in the
operating system business.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, many of the states _ including New York, Ohio,
Minnesota and Utah _ are eager to use provisions in their own laws
that would allow them to fine Microsoft for every antitrust
violation ``incident.'' The amount for each incident varies, from
$2,000 in Kentucky to $100,000 in New York, but there is little if
any case law to suggest how an incident is defined in this context.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in several states said they were hoping to establish
that every purchase of a copy of Windows constituted a violation.
``With per violation or per occurrence, that would be millions and
millions of dollars,'' said Doug Davis, an assistant attorney
general in West Virginia. But state officials acknowledged that it
was far from certain that the courts would uphold that
interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the states have stayed out of the spotlight, relying
primarily on the Justice Department's lawyers, most notably its
lead trial lawyer and hired gun, David Boies, to argue the case in
court.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the states are key players.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen states researched the case cooperatively with the
Justice Department. When it came time to file the suit last spring,
one of those states, Texas, decided to drop out of the effort,
while a handful of additional states, including West Virginia and
Maryland, decided to join. That brought the total to 20.
</P>
<P>
   In December, South Carolina's attorney general announced that he
was leaving the group, asserting that competition in the software
industry remained strong, making the suit unnecessary. The 19
remaining attorneys general say they remain strongly committed to
the case.
</P>
<P>
   After the Justice Department and the states filed similar but
separate antitrust suits against Microsoft last May, the cases were
merged and are being tried together. So, although Justice officials
say they have not yet decided on what remedies to propose should
they win, whatever they recommend to Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson
must have the approval of the states as co-litigants.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the remedy Jackson imposes might or might not be
based on the recommendations of the plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   Because state attorneys general are elected officials, their
motives are not always the same as those of the Justice Department.
They must be more responsive to their constituents _ or, viewed
more cynically, play to the voters.
</P>
<P>
   When the suits were filed last May, ``we got some constituent
mail asking why we were harassing Microsoft,'' said Mark Weaver,
Ohio's deputy attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   But now, says Richard Blumenthal, attorney general of
Connecticut, ``We feel vindicated.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The public,'' he added, ``has a much better understanding of
Microsoft's abuses and violations of law.''
</P>
<P>
   While Microsoft insists that it will win the case, the hardened
position on remedies is fueled by a growing perception among the
attorneys general that their side has gained the upper hand in
court. In interviews last week, attorneys general or their
assistants in more than a dozen states said they had been
pleasantly surprised, even thrilled, with their accomplishments in
court _ though all acknowledge that the judge could ultimately rule
in Microsoft's favor.
</P>
<P>
   The government and Microsoft have both completed presentation of
their cases, and the trial is now in recess until mid-April, when
each side will present rebuttal witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Blumenthal said, ``Our case has been more powerful and
vivid than we ever anticipated.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Granholm, Michigan's attorney general, said: ``We feel
very good. It's safe to say our confidence has improved; the
credibility of the Microsoft defense seems to have been seriously
damaged.''
</P>
<P>
   That perception has emboldened the states to consider asking for
stronger remedies than they might have originally contemplated.
</P>
<P>
   In a broad sense, antitrust remedies fall into two classes:
conduct relief and structural relief.
</P>
<P>
   If the court imposed conduct relief, Microsoft would remain
intact, and its business incentives would not be changed. Instead,
the company's ability to engage in illegal conduct would be
limited. One example might be to regulate the sorts of contracts
the company could write.
</P>
<P>
   Structural relief would include any remedy that would change the
nature of Microsoft's business incentives, the motivations for its
competitive behavior. Structural remedies could include forcing the
company to license the source code of its software to competitors.
It could also mean breaking up the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bar has been raised,'' said one attorney general, who,
like several interviewed, asked not to be identified. ``The mere
thought that people are talking about dividing up the company now
shows that the thinking has advanced. It was mentioned before, but
not discussed with the level of plausibility it's being discussed
now.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason some states say they joined the Microsoft case was
that they were not satisfied with the government's conclusion of
the last antitrust case against Microsoft, in 1995. That one ended
with a consent decree _ a form of conduct relief.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, state officials say, immediately worked around the
agreement, and all of the behavior that is the subject of the
current suit occurred in the following years.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Microsoft,'' a senior assistant attorney general said,
``it's pretty clear that conduct relief is not lasting.''
</P>
<P>
   Several state officials said they were impressed with evidence
introduced during the trial indicating that Microsoft had never
taken the earlier consent agreement seriously. Just a few months
after that agreement, Bill Gates, Microsoft's chairman, told a
group of business allies, ``This antitrust thing will blow over; we
haven't changed our business practices at all,'' according to notes
of that discussion.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Microsoft's strategy in court _ vociferously
contesting every point, no matter how much contrary evidence is
introduced _ has helped convince attorneys general that nothing
short of a structural remedy would have any effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their behavior has proven the need for an effective remedy,''
said Wayne Klein, head of the antitrust division in the Utah
attorney general's office. ``There's no contrition there. No
admission that they did anything wrong. And we're now in a position
where we think we can establish something that's effective.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Granholm said, ``We've got to have a remedy with teeth.''
</P>
<P>
   The attorneys general are now debating three possible structural
remedies. The one least favored at the moment, several officials
said, would break the company into two or three parts. One of the
new companies would keep the Windows operating system, another the
applications programs like Word and Excel. A third company,
possibly, would get Microsoft's Internet and multimedia businesses.
</P>
<P>
   That idea has lost favor, the officials said, because whichever
new company had Windows would still hold a monopoly in personal
computer operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   Another idea is to break the company into three equal parts,
each of which would have complete copies of Microsoft's source code
and intellectual property. They then would begin competing with
each other. One problem with this idea is deciding which company
would get Gates.
</P>
<P>
   Some attorneys general say they worried that the third proposal
_ forcing Microsoft to license the Windows source code to other
companies _ would end up creating incompatible versions of Windows,
resulting in software that runs on one machine but not on another.
But other state officials argue that all of the companies creating
new versions of Windows would have strong incentives to make sure
their versions were compatible with the others.
</P>
<P>
   One assistant attorney general heavily involved with the
discussions insisted that the states were not limited to these
ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still exploring things,'' he said, ``and other things
might come up, stuff we hadn't even though of before.''
</P>
<P>
   But for all that, the states do seem unanimous about requesting
one specific remedy: forcing Microsoft to pay their legal fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``And given the number of lawyers who are working on this,''
said Weaver, the Ohio official, ``that bill is not going to be
insubstantial.''

APPLE ADOPTS `OPEN SOURCE' STRATEGY  
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CUPERTINO, Calif. _ The ``open source'' software movement won a
vote of confidence Tuesday from yet another major computer maker
with Apple Computer's release of an operating system for the server
computers that connect desktop and laptop machines across a
business or to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The company said its Mac OS X Server would position Apple to
compete in the hot market for small servers priced below $5,000, a
market now dominated by Compaq Computer, Dell Computer,
Hewlett-Packard, Sun Microsystems and IBM.
</P>
<P>
   But just as significant as the product itself is Apple's
adoption of a strategy known as open source, which means that it is
releasing its source code, the original instructions written by the
programmers who created it. Apple has dubbed the software for this
Darwin.
</P>
<P>
   With traditional software models, once the original code has
been compiled into an executable program, it is difficult and
illegal to reconstruct the lines of instructions written by the
programmers. In most cases, companies that make operating systems
jealously protect these instructions as trade secrets, giving
outside developers only enough information to enable them to write
their own software.
</P>
<P>
   The open source movement has been gathering momentum in
corporate markets for several reasons. In addition to being easy to
adapt and modify, it has developed a reputation for being more
stable than traditional software because a growing community of
programmers _ many of whom are developers _ are continually fixing
any flaws they stumble across.
</P>
<P>
   And paradoxically, open source has developed a reputation for
being more secure than commercial software because it can be
examined for loopholes by independent programmers.
</P>
<P>
   The open source movement has been spurred by the widespread and
growing adoption of Linux, an open source operating system
developed over the last decade in a collaboration among a worldwide
group of programmers.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the open source movement has concentrated on
software that runs on server computers, not on desktop computers, a
market dominated by Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Like Linux, Darwin is one type of Unix, an operating system
invented at AT&AMP;T's Bell Laboratories in the late 1960s. Other
versions of the Unix operating system include Sun's Solaris and
IBM's AIX.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters, analysts and employees in a small
auditorium on the company's corporate campus here, Apple's interim
chief executive, Steven Jobs, said that Apple was stepping into the
corporate server market cautiously and with modest ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to start by walking, and then later this year
we'll be jogging, and by next year we'll be running,'' Jobs said.
Alluding to the introduction last year of its most popular computer
of the decade, he added, ``Our heads are not so swollen by the
success of the iMac, that we don't realize that we have a lot to
learn.''
</P>
<P>
   The $499 Mac OS X Server software will not run Macintosh
applications but will serve as a platform for server programs that
coordinate the sharing of centralized data in work groups and
distribute World Wide Web pages. The company also announced that it
was bundling the software with its fastest Macintosh G3 desktop
computer, and selling the system for $4,999.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs cited Internet performance benchmarks suggesting that the
system was a more powerful Web server than similarly configured
systems from Dell and Sun.
</P>
<P>
   The open source software package, or Darwin, will include the
operating system's most fundamental code, or ``kernel,'' known as
Mach, bundled with a set of services based on the Berkeley Systems
Design version of Unix, and a version of one of the first and most
popular open source programs, the Apache Web server, converted for
the Mac.
</P>
<P>
   The source code was placed on Apple's Web site Tuesday for free
downloading.
</P>
<P>
   The shift in strategy for Apple, which has traditionally
protected its software under proprietary licensing, was applauded
by some of the leading figures in the open source movement, a
number of whom sat in the front row during the presentation by
Jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The open source community is delighted about this
announcement,'' said Eric Raymond, a programmer who has figured
prominently in the development of the movement, which sprang from
the hacker culture.
</P>
<P>
   The open source decision will also likely strengthen Apple's
hand in the educational market in part because of pricing and
because, in the words of Gavin Eadie, the director of the strategic
technology group at the University of Michigan, ``With open source
we can get in there and make our changes.''

 &HT;    Headley is the star by far on John's `Aida'
 &HT;    By Kathy Janich
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whether on disc or onstage, Elton John's ``Aida'' has one
shining moment. It's Heather Headley snap-crackle-popping her way
through ``Elaborate Lives,'' an anthem of forbidden love and its
dicey consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Hers is the brightest jewel on this pop version of John and
lyricist Tim Rice's stage musical, the genuine article among what
is mostly costume jewelry. Joining Headley are cast member Sherie
Scott and popsters Sting, LeAnn Rimes, Tina Turner, the Spice
Girls, Boyz II Men, Shania Twain, Lenny Kravitz, Janet Jackson and,
of course, Elton, who gets to sing more than anyone else. (His
game, his ball?)
</P>
<P>
   Although enjoyable, this ``Aida'' is a puzzle. Just who is it
for? It's more show music than pop but probably won't sate either
audience. It's more money grab than artistic vision, its heart and
ego at odds, much like the legend's Egyptians and enslaved Nubians.
</P>
<P>
   Yet who can't see the fun in the Spice Girls' ``My Strongest
Suit,'' a fashion-forward pastiche on clothing, makeup and
accessories? Or the truth in the John-Rimes love duet ``Written in
the Stars''? Or the drama in Twain's ``Amneris' Letter''? The disc
is truly a mixed bag. We wonder, will it sell?

 &HT;    Orton's emotions shine through
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tech-friendly folkie Beth Orton has a voice that cuts through
static. She's not demonstrative or hydraulic, but she wins you over
almost immediately with her unvarnished realness and low-key
vulnerability. It's an interesting quality for the British singer
to have, because she's been aligned with the burgeoning electronic
dance music scene _ lending guest vocals to the Chemical Brothers,
for instance _ that thrives on souped-up artifice. On ``Central
Reservation,'' her second album, Orton comes across as a late '90s
exponent of the soulful introspection that guided Van Morrison and
Joni Mitchell in the early '70s.
</P>
<P>
   And like those artists, she's not confined to the coffeehouse
idiom _ she knows how to twist syllables free of their meaning,
opening up the realm of pure suggestion. She's mutable, slipping
from the chimey ambience of the opening ``Stolen Car'' (a piece
whose arrangement recalls those of retro-heartbreak specialist
Chris Isaak), to the strings-and-vibes laden ``Pass in Time'' (an
``Astral Weeks''-ish hymn, featuring forgotten '70s singer Terry
Callier), to a dance remix of the title track (tweaked by Ben Watt
of Everything But the Girl).
</P>
<P>
   Lyrically, there are no earth-
</P>
<P>
   shaking revelations. A line such as ``All your pain just turns
into release/All your doubt becomes your own belief'' probably
wouldn't sell a condolence card, but Orton can make you listen to
it and nod along because of the feeling she puts behind it.

   ``Fuse'' Joe Henry. Mammoth. 11 tracks. Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   There's a whole mess of Joe Henry's devoted fans who don't care
a whit that he's related by marriage to Madonna (wife Melanie is
the Material Diva's sister). They appreciate the North Carolina
songsmith for his adventurous, expansive body of work, which seems
to morph into thrilling new shapes with each album. Henry's eighth
release ripples with a soulful groove that is far removed from the
earnest country-rock of his critically lauded 1993 album ``Kindness
of the World.'' Such trip-hoppy tracks as ``Angels'' and ``Fat''
suggest a marriage between Leon Russell and the Sneaker Pimps. Best
of all is the title cut, a languid ballad with a '70s R&AMP;B flavor.
Henry's easy command of myriad styles should give even his
chameleonic sister-in-law pause.

   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Dipping into George Strait's new CD is like a trip to the
springhouse _ you know exactly what you're going to get, and it
tastes great every time. The main drawback in this collection of
solid country is that only a couple of tracks are standouts from
the usual down-home Strait meal: the clever Kostas tune ``One of
You'' and the sweet love song ``That's Where I Wanna Take Our
Love,'' by Dean Dillon and Hank Cochran. Strait is one of those
stars whose talent is so consistent it can often become redundant,
like vacationing at the same beach house for 10 years in a row. In
fact, the title track is a lazy reworking of a shuffle off Strait's
last CD, ``We Really Shouldn't Be Doing This.''

</P>
<P>
   Here's how you break ``100% Ginuwine'' into its individual
parts: First, there's a whole lot of Timbaland. The producer, who
made his debut on Ginuwine's million-selling 1996 debut, ``The
Bachelor,'' twists and turns his keyboard in less predictable
directions than the chaotic drum machine sound that's become his
signature. Give Ginuwine an equal share of credit for proving as
limber vocally as the bouncy production on ``What's So Different?''
and approaching the emotive ability of Sam Cooke on ``None of Ur
Friends Business.'' The re-
</P>
<P>
   mainder is a tolerable hodgepodge of clever scenarios (``Fin-
</P>

and a kind of vulnerability rarely revealed by male R&AMP;B artists.

<TEXT>
watered-down comedy. After a successful stab at romantic comedy in
``The Wedding Singer,'' Adam Sandler returns to his lowbrow roots
with this ``Happy Gilmore'' rewrite about a bayou bumpkin who
becomes a college football star. It's dumb and predictable, which
would be OK if there were more laughs. But Kathy Bates is hilarious
as Sandler's domineering mama. Grade: C
<P>
   _ Doug Hamilton
</P>
<P>
   ``Bulworth'' (R) _ Provocative, funny and unbalanced _ just like
politics. Director, star and co-writer Warren Beatty plays the
titular senator from California, who breaks down while watching his
latest re-election commercials. Hiring a hit man with himself as
the target, he returns to campaigning, where his meltdown becomes
very public. Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   _ Steve Murray
</P>
<P>
   ``Living Out Loud'' (R) _ A suddenly single fortysomething
(Holly Hunter) leaves her tony Upper East Side co-op and ventures
into new territory, a cross-town jazz bar, where she becomes
friends with the resident torch singer (Queen Latifah), and has a
``kinda'' relationship with her building's elevator operator (Danny
DeVito). The tone is bittersweet, the story unresolved, but the
performances are fresh and funny. Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   _ Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
</P>
<P>
   ``Polish Wedding'' (PG-13) _ Though it played the art-house
circuit, this is more like a ``Moonstruck'' wannabe than anything
Christina Ricci has done lately. In Detroit, a large Polish family
wrestles with everything from adultery to teen pregnancy. Director
Theresa Connelly's film may be shaky and cliched, but her strong
cast (Lena Olin, Gabriel Byrne and Claire Danes) comes to her
rescue. Grade: B-

 &HT;    Unrewarded roles may aid actors at Oscars
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cramming for Sunday's Oscars? Sometimes it pays not only to see
the nominated films but to take a quick gander at an actor's
previous work on video.
</P>
<P>
   Oscar history is littered with winners who often won for earlier
films. Elizabeth Taylor copped her first Academy Award in 1960 for
the lame ``Butterfield 8,'' not because she was great in it but
because she was sick and reportedly near death. Plus, she had been
overlooked three times in the '50s for Oscar-worthy performances:
1959's ``Suddenly, Last Summer,'' 1958's ``Cat on a Hot Tin Roof''
and 1957's ``Raintree County.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, Michael Caine won a best supporting actor trophy for
``Hannah and Her Sisters.'' He probably deserved it. But it helped
that he'd previously been nominated for best actor _ and lost _ for
even better performances in 1972's ``Sleuth'' and 1966's ``Alfie.''
</P>
<P>
   All of this year's acting nominees deserve to be in their races.
But a few might have an edge based on history. To accurately gauge
Sunday's playing field, check out some of their earlier work on
video.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Robert Duvall (``A Civil Action,'' supporting actor) _ Prepare
to be amazed.
</P>
<P>
   Duvall has more than held his own in a steady flow of
tremendously powerful films filled with powerful actors. ``To Kill
a Mockingbird.'' ``The Godfather.'' ``The Godfather, Part II.''
``Apocalypse Now.'' ``The Great Santini.'' ``Network.'' ``MASH.''
``Tender Mercies'' (which won him a best actor trophy in 1983).
</P>
<P>
   While he does light up the screen in ``A Civil Action,'' it's
more likely he's nominated this year for losing last year.
</P>
<P>
   Check out ``The Apostle.'' It's the film Duvall nurtured on his
own, financed on his own, made virtually on his own and marketed
pretty much on his own. He played a preacher confronting his own
demons, copped a best actor nomination and promptly lost to Jack
Nicholson's showy performance in ``As Good as It Gets.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Judi Dench (``Shakespeare in Love,'' supporting actress) _
Everybody's talking about her limited screen time as Queen
Elizabeth in ``Love'' and whether that might rule her out of this
year's race.
</P>
<P>
   Oscar doesn't work that way.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, Beatrice Straight won for roughly five minutes of
screen time, the bulk of that in one scene, as the jilted wife of
William Holden in ``Network.'' In that one scene, Straight hijacked
the film.
</P>
<P>
   So does Dench in ``Shakespeare in Love.'' Plus, on video she's
got a stellar performance in ``Mrs. Brown,'' the film that brought
her a best actress nod last year. She lost to Helen Hunt's _ again
_ showy performance in ``As Good as It Gets.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Brown,'' Dench plays a different queen _ Victoria. The
results, though, are nearly identical. She commands every frame
she's in.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Ian McKellen (``Gods and Monsters,'' actor) _ His fine-tuned
performance as ``Frankenstein'' director James Whale in ``Gods and
Monsters'' is surpassed by his remarkable portrayal of political
evil in 1995's Nazi-laced rendition of ``Richard III.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Lynn Redgrave (``Gods and Monsters,'' supporting actress) _
She's a curious stitch in ``Gods and Monsters'' in the watchable
role of Whale's tic-laden housekeeper, but 33 years ago she was
equally noticeable as an ugly-duckling mod in Britain's groovy
``Georgy Girl.''
</P>
<P>
   The role landed her a nomination for best actress, a race in
which she promptly lost to Elizabeth Taylor (``Who's Afraid of
Virginia Woolf?'').
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Ed Harris (``The Truman Show,'' supporting actor) _ As the
godlike tele-artist Christof in ``Truman,'' Harris shows the
ethereal side of his acting that moviegoers haven't really
witnessed before.
</P>
<P>
   But what they have seen are rock-solid characterizations,
including the manic salesman in 1992's ``Glengarry Glen Ross,'' the
focused mission chief in 1995's ``Apollo 13'' (he was nominated for
supporting actor but lost to Kevin Spacey in ``The Usual
Suspects'') and the cheating husband seeking redemption in 1984's
``Places in the Heart.''

 &HT;    `True'-blue Streep is only thing slick weeper has going for it
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``One True Thing'' (R)
</P>
<P>
   If there's ever a time to catch ``One True Thing,'' it's now.
</P>
<P>
   Meryl Streep is nominated for an Oscar for her pitch-perfect
characterization of the dying homemaker mom from Anna Quindlen's
book. Trouble is, the movie strikes too many false notes to be the
three-hankie weeper it wants to be.
</P>
<P>
   The drama centers on Renee Zellweger, playing career-journalist
Ellen Gulden, dubbed by her colleagues to be ``cold and
insensitive.'' She's the opposite of her mom (Streep), and once
they're thrown together it's clear Ellen can't keep up.
</P>
<P>
   Streep's performance is terrific, but the movie suffers from
generic slickness. Grade: B-

NEW AND NOTABLE BOOKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE STEPHENSON  
 c.1999 Special to The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A survey of recently published books:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; SWIMMING WITH JONAH &QL; 
 &UR; Audrey Schulman (Avon, $22)
</P>
<P>
   Schulman's first novel, ``The Cage,'' was the harrowing story of
a woman who joined a magazine expedition to northern Canada, where
she took photographs of polar bears from inside a metal cage set on
the ice. It was a rite of passage of sorts for its protagonist _ an
emergence into a strength and resilience that she did not know she
had _ and there is a similar transformation in Schulman's new
novel. Jane Guy, daughter of a prominent doctor and a beautiful
ballerina, cannot get into medical school in the United States and
so is accepted _ because her parents can pay an exorbitant tuition
_ at ``the boot camp of medical schools'' on a tiny Indonesian
island. The school is meant for problem students, rich students,
those who failed, for one reason or another, to gain acceptance
elsewhere. The tactics of the teaching staff involve psychological
abuse, which seems even worse in the dense, tropical atmosphere of
the island, the heat and humidity that make test papers come back
sweat-stained from the hands of the teachers who graded them. There
is a sense of desperation in Jane and the other students as they
dream of leaving this dreadful school. Jane begins to change,
however, coming into a new self-awareness and even bravery.
Ultimately, she is transformed in this story of an unsettling,
menacing place and the things it brings out in the people who are
trapped there. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; SUCH A PRETTY, PRETTY GIRL &QL; 
 &UR; Winston Groom (Random House, $23.95)
</P>
<P>
   ``Book reviewers can be pissy, can't they?'' a character says in
Groom's new novel, and it's especially true when a reviewer finds
herself locked in a room with a book like this one. Groom
(``Forrest Gump'') has produced a rather poor imitation of the old
detective novels we love, which brings up the obvious question: Why
take this detour if you can still have the real thing? The
narrator, an Oscar-winning screenwriter named Johnny Lightfoot,
meets up with an old flame, Los Angeles news anchor Delia Jamison,
who has ``worn well'' in the 20 years since Johnny saw her last
(she still has those ``wide, lush, Deborah Norville lips,'' we're
happy to say). Trouble is, poor Delia is getting anonymous letters
and phone calls from someone who obviously knows her _ he's
familiar with her sexual habits, but so are half the men in Los
Angeles _ and is demanding that she wear certain clothes during a
broadcast or leave the top buttons of her blouse undone. Even
though her husband's best friend owns a detective agency, and even
though Johnny Lightfoot writes screenplays for a living, Delia asks
Johnny to help her out. He's a novice sleuth but smart enough to
know that ``no trap is as deadly as the one you set for yourself.''
In this case, that would be his lingering feelings for Delia
Jamison. The narration is plodding and the climax is dopey, and not
even the lovely Delia can save the day.  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ROBERT FROST &QL; 
 &UR; Jay Parini (Holt, $35)
</P>
<P>
   He once said, memorably, that each of his poems was ``a
momentary stay against confusion.'' Robert Frost struggled
throughout his life with depression and self-doubt, but he was
also, Parini writes, ``a man of immense fortitude, an attentive
father and an artist of the first order who understood what he must
do to create a body of work of lasting significance, to `lodge a
few poems where they can't be gotten rid of easily,' as he often
said.'' This sympathetic reading of Frost's life and work was a
labor of love for its author _ ``one of the few books,'' Parini
says, ``that I have ever finished with deep reluctance.'' Included
is a section called ``Frost and His Biographers,'' in which Parini
suggests that Frost has not been well-served by the people who have
written about him. Early profiles and biographies portrayed him as
a farmer-poet full of homespun wisdom, a persona Frost himself
promoted. Then came Lawrance Thompson, Frost's official biographer,
who portrayed Frost as a monster (the word appeared more than once
in the three-volume work, giving reviewers the image of Frost as a
selfish, egomaniacal, cruel man _ ``a more hateful human being
cannot have lived,'' one wrote in the ``New York Times''). Later,
there was reaction against Thompson, including ``Robert Frost: A
Literary Life Reconsidered,'' by William H. Pritchard. Parini says
his own book ``sets the record straight here and there, putting in
place a fresh mythos, one that combs the facts in a certain
direction but does not preclude a future biographer (and there will
be many) from combing the same material differently.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; WORK WOULD BE GREAT IF IT WEREN'T FOR THE PEOPLE &QL; 
 &UR; Ronna Lichtenberg (Hyperion, $22.95)
</P>
<P>
   We can see you now, nodding as if Lichtenberg was in your head
when she thought up that title. It's her premise that no one can
avoid office politics, and it's OK to be good at them. She even
sugarcoats it: Being good at office politics ``means you know how
to turn individual agendas into common goals.'' Where, you ask,
does the back stabbing come in? Between the lines. Actually, this
is a funny book, with subject headings such as ``Politics in the
Time of Cholera'' and ``How to Suck Up'' and ``You Are Where You
Eat'' and ``Come Blow Your Own Horn.'' We learn that hair and nails
are political tools for women (in certain parts of the country,
Lichtenberg says, ``you want your hair to be blonde, immobile, and
to extend as far from your skull as possible''), and watches and
shoes are strategic choices for men. She also includes some short
quizzes, which New &AMP; Notable took and failed. Like so many worker
bees, we have a lot to learn. &QL;

FANS HELP GIVE WNBA's PERROT STRENGTH IN BATTLE AGAINST CANCER 
 
(Photo available on NYT database) 
 
By BRUCE WESTBROOK 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Shortly after learning she had lung cancer and brain
tumors, Kim Perrot discovered something else: She has thousands of
new teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Since revealing her illness last month, the Houston Comets point
guard has received thousands of calls, cards, letters, e-mail
messages, flowers, packages and other support from Houston and
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means a lot,'' a smiling Perrot said while opening her
mail, which was piled high on the desk of Comets and Rockets owner
Leslie Alexander.
</P>
<P>
   ``All those who have written and said prayers _ we're all on a
team now. They're part of my team, and I feel good, because if I'm
praying and doing what I need to do and other people are praying
for me, I can't lose.''
</P>
<P>
   The WNBA's Web site link to Perrot had to be discontinued when
it was overwhelmed by more than 5,000 e-mail messages. Other
electronic mail has been forwarded to Perrot from local TV and
radio stations and the Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   A book-size print-out of the electronic messages is being
compiled for Perrot by Megan Bonifas, Comets manager of media
services.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shocked and saddened at the news of your illness,'' a
man e-mailed from Oakland, Calif. ``But I was encouraged by your
attitude and determination.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone I know is talking about what a fighter you are,''
wrote a Houston fan. ``No one expected you to become starting point
guard for the Comets. Take that fiery determination and hustle and
focus all that energy and talent on this new fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Banners and cards have also arrived from radio stations, Texas
Children's Cancer Center Families and Special Olympics. Many who
wrote wanted to share their own experiences about battling disease.
</P>
<P>
   Perrot, 32, had surgery Feb. 24 to remove a golf ball-size brain
tumor. She now is undergoing 2{ weeks of radiation treatment for
smaller tumors and soon will start six months of chemotherapy for
lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ritsuko Komaki, who is overseeing the treatments, said
Perrot's excellent health improves her chances and she is
``confident'' the remaining tumors can be eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   While Perrot's doctors are optimistic, hospital spokeswoman Jane
Brust said the treatment is ``a process, and they're cautious about
long-term results or giving a long-term score card. It will be a
while before there's a real clear picture of how she's doing.''
</P>
<P>
   But Perrot isn't approaching her recovery in quiet seclusion.
She has quickly resumed her public life, which now has an even
larger stage.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday night she attended gospel singer Kirk Franklin's
Compaq Center concert, where 10,000 fans joined in prayerful
support.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Perrot also resumed her motivational speaking
appearances at area schools. In the basketball offseason, she talks
to students about fitness, education, diligence and saying no to
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Her illness won't change that message, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My life has a plan, and this is just another chapter,'' Perrot
said. ``It all revolves around the same thing _ the struggles I've
had _ and how throughout those struggles I've always won the
battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is another battle. It's just a bigger battle. I will
still tell my story.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, she is reading up to 50 cards and letters each night
and plans to read ``every single one of them, word for word.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone took time to write me, to send their blessings and
prayers, it's more than fair for me to read what they sent.''
</P>
<P>
   Perrot hopes to find a way to respond to each person, perhaps
with help from the Comets media staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's possible, we'll send every single person a thank-you
note,'' she said. ``I can't individually write everyone, but I do
want them to know that I received their letter and read it and am
thankful for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Fellow cancer sufferers Darryl Strawberry of the New York
Yankees and Eric Davis of the St. Louis Cardinals also have called
to offer support, as did comedian Bill Cosby, representatives of
the Rev. Jesse Jackson's Rainbow Coalition and WNBA president Val
Ackerman. And she's received flowers from the Rockets' Charles
Barkley and the Indiana Pacers' Reggie Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Perrot doesn't distinguish between celebrity supporters and
everyday fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every prayer, every letter, means the same in my heart,'' she
said. ``I've had celebrities call _ people I didn't know, had only
seen on TV _ but I've also been touched by all the people who wrote
to share their story about a family member or a friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one means more than the other. All of this means a lot to
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Perrot did give special thanks to the Comets and Rockets
organizations for their support.
</P>
<P>
   ``Becoming a Comet _ that right there changed my life.''
</P>
<P>
   She has already resumed light workouts at Westside Tennis
Center, where the Comets and Rockets practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not 100 percent where I'd be if I didn't need surgery, but
I'm doing the right things, taking it slowly and doing what my body
allows me to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``My training isn't as intense as it would be, but that's OK.
I've got to start somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Perrot hasn't circled her calendar for the Comets' training camp
in mid-May, ``because a year ago I wouldn't have circled it,
either,'' she said. ``I'm just living like I would normally.''
</P>
<P>
   At 5-feet-5 and without being a draft pick, Perrot was a
long-shot to make the team. But she persevered and quickly evolved
into the Comets' quarterback and emotional leader on the floor
through two championship seasons.
</P>
<P>
   While this tenacity reflects a positive outlook Perrot has
nurtured since long before her illness, the ordeal has sparked an
even better attitude, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today I was walking my dog, and I picked up a flower just to
appreciate it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been a positive person, but not to the point where
one flower, one breath, meant so much. I took the little things for
granted. Now I appreciate nature and just breathing because I'm
fighting for my life.''
</P>
<P>
   She feels the huge outpouring of support has boosted that
battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see us all as a team,'' Perrot said. ``I play for the
Comets, a two-time champion, and now I have a worldwide team.
</P>
<P>
   ``These cards and letters have given me strength. It's
unbelievable _ amazing. Words can't describe what this support does
for me. It has touched me immensely, and I thank God for that.''

NEW EXPLORATIONS CAN BRING RISKS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By HARRY SHATTUCK 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They never intended to make a political statement. They only
wanted to see the gorillas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eight tourists slaughtered by rebels in Uganda,'' headlines
relayed the tragic story early this month.
</P>
<P>
   Two Americans. Four Britons. Two New Zealanders. No doubt
exhilarated by the opportunity to stretch the limits of their
travel experiences, to broaden their educations, to savor the
thrill of a new and exotic encounter with nature.
</P>
<P>
   Just like so many others among us.
</P>
<P>
   But victims instead of a band of Hutu guerrillas angered by
American, British and Ugandan support for the present government of
Rwanda, its neighboring East African country.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
ALWAYS A DANGER &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Did these tourists sense the perils of their journey? We may
never know. They were by all accounts sophisticated, experienced
travelers. Even though the project they came to visit dates only to
the 1990s, several thousand people before them had traveled without
incident to and from Bwindi Impenetrable Forest, a national park
tucked into the southwestern corner of Uganda that is home to about
320 mountain gorillas, half the world's remaining population.
Reports indicate that new guerrilla threats against U.S. and
British visitors had not been forwarded to tour companies.
</P>
<P>
   This tragedy serves as a reminder that as our travels become
more wide-reaching _ and as tour companies seek to satisfy our
yearnings _ we're not always shielded from risks. We've learned
this in other foreign countries, and in our own.
</P>
<P>
   Does this mean we should avoid extending our horizons? An
emphatic no. Should it heighten our awareness, encourage us to
learn as much as possible about a nation or a region or a people in
advance of a trip? A resounding yes.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
IT'S A SMALL WORLD &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Consider how times have changed:
</P>
<P>
   A half-century ago, we fantasized about seeing the Eiffel Tower,
Vatican City, the beaches of Hawaii and the glaciers of Alaska. A
trip to the Great Wall of China or Peru's Machu Picchu was beyond
our wildest imaginations.
</P>
<P>
   Now that television and the jet airplane have shrunk the world,
our appetites are whetted not just for these wonders but also for
deeper explorations. No place is too remote, too mysterious, for
our desire to taste adventure, to appreciate nature and to
understand distinct human cultures.
</P>
<P>
   Who would have thought in the late 1960s and early '70s that
Vietnam would emerge as one of the most popular Asian vacation
destinations for Americans? Or that a Marriott hotel would beckon
visitors to Moscow? How likely was it a decade ago that U.S.-based
tour companies would now be sponsoring organized excursions to
Iran? How long before Cuba is reopened to mainstream U.S. tourism?
</P>
<P>
   Through years of war and internal conflict, Uganda hardly seemed
a place many of us would relish visiting. But, according to one
leading authority, Bwindi represents ``an exemplary ecotourism
project.''
</P>
<P>
   Martha Honey, director of the peace and security program at the
Institute for Policy Studies in Washington, D.C., and author of the
newly released ``Ecotourism and Sustainable Development: Who Owns
Paradise?'' (Island Press, $25 paperback, $50 cloth), lived for
several years in Tanzania, just across the Ugandan border. Her
earlier books include ``War in Uganda: The Legacy of Idi Amin''
(Lawrence Hill), written with husband Tony Avirgan and published in
1982.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've walked across Uganda; I've taken many steps in that
national park,'' Honey said during a recent visit to Houston. ``The
people of Uganda were doing so much right with tourism there. The
World Wildlife Fund has spent considerable time and effort in the
park. The local villages were involved in getting people to the
camps. And unlike in many other places, a large percentage of the
profits from tours were being retained for the park and for
community development.''
</P>
<P>
   Though tours usually operated at 100 percent _ and with a price
tag of about $150 for one hour of viewing _ only small groups were
allowed to track the gorillas made famous by the 1988 movie
``Gorillas in the Mist,'' which focused on mountain gorillas in
Rwanda. According to Honey, Ugandan officials had successfully _
and honorably _ resisted pressure from tour companies to allow more
people (and thus more potential income) into the park.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was raising 40 percent of Uganda's tourism profits,''
Honey said of the Bwindi project. ``That will be dead now. (Indeed,
most tour companies have temporarily canceled trips to the area.)
Tourism in neighboring Kenya and Tanzania will be affected, too.
And the mountain gorillas may well be slaughtered by the human
guerrillas.''
</P>
<P>
   One lesson for tourists, Honey suggested, ``is the need to be
more conscious about what politics we support when we travel. This
is important not only for our personal safety but because travel
does make a political statement. It was that way in South Africa
during apartheid. In Uganda today, these marauding bands don't like
our politics, and they're out to get Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's important, too, Honey said, ``to recognize that this is
an isolated situation. We have to let people know that not all
places in that area are dangerous, that Tanzania and Kenya aren't
dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, we can only hope that Bwindi _ and the mountain
gorillas within _ will someday be safe again to visit.

JOINT COMPOUND WILL SMOOTH BEAMS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for Indianapolis and all needing; moved March 11.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER C. HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Q. The rough-hewn beams in my family room are almost black. I
not only want them smooth, but I'd also like to paint them lighter.
I would not want to box them in because that would make them too
big for the room. I've heard that you can apply joint compound to
smooth them out and then paint. Would that work?
</P>
<P>
   JANE WISLEDER, Hingham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. You betcha. You answered your own question. The roughness of
the beams will allow the joint compound to stick well, even
resisting peeling when the wood expands and contracts. To make sure
the compound will resist peeling, apply as thin a coat as possible.
The more coats, the smoother the finish, but it is better to stick
to one, two at the most. Paint with two coats of a flat or eggshell
latex wall paint.
</P>
<P>
   Q. My Corian countertops are scratched, and I was told to sand
out the scratches. I power-sanded and made a mess; the surface is
now very uneven, with different glosses. What did I do wrong, and
is there any way I can improve the surface?
</P>
<P>
   M.S., Andover, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. I think that while sanding is good to take scratches and
stains off Corian, power-sanding is not. Try steady, overall
hand-sanding with the finest sandpaper you can obtain, or emery
cloth. Or, use one of those stiff plastic scrubbers of a coarse
consistency; the kitchen Scotch pads are not stiff enough. If you
are reluctant to do that, call the dealer or Dow, the manufacturer;
they might have additional suggestions.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have some metal casement windows that have no
weatherstripping; the windows close with a metal-to-metal contact,
not very good for weather-tightness. Where can I find a retrofit
seal for such casements?
</P>
<P>
   PETER ZIMMERMAN, Concord, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. I suggest using self-adhesive foam tape. Press it in place on
the frame where the window closes on the frame. This way the window
will press against the foam, compressing it when the window is
closed. With this method there will be no frictional wear on the
foam. It will simply be compressed, which does not amount to much
wear and tear.
</P>
<P>
   Window places might carry a weatherstrip just for metal windows.
</P>
<P>
   Q. My 1961 house has a septic tank, which is OK, but my
neighbor's failed the state's Title 5 test, so I am a little leery
of mine. Now we are getting sewers in the street. Are there any
negatives to a hookup to city sewers?
</P>
<P>
   JOHN HART, Natick, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Absolutely none, in my opnion, and I speak from experience,
having had a cesspool for some years that was creating a dismal,
smelly swamp in the back yard. I had good reason to go to sewers
when they came in, and I think I was the first in my block to do
so.
</P>
<P>
   It would be wise for you to be the first (or second, after your
neighbor) to hook up. It'll cost a sum to hook up, and the annual
sewer charge will nearly equal the water bill, because sewer usage
is calculated on water usage, but I think you will be happy with
it.
</P>
<P>
   And there is a bonus: Your septic tank won't need pumping out
anymore. Of course, the savings won't equal your annual sewer
charge, but you'll rest easy knowing there is no septic system to
fail.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What's the best time to start painting the outside of my
house? Is there anything more to preparation than scraping and
sanding?
</P>
<P>
   ANDREW WALL, Somerville, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Paint when the temperature is 50 degrees Fahrenheit or higher
and will stay that way, and below 90 degrees. This information is
on the can of stain or paint. Scraping old paint and sanding are
the two most important parts of preparation. And you can start
anytime while waiting for painting weather. Another important part
of preparation is to wash or power-wash with detergent and water
after sanding.

CAPITALIST RETOOL: FORBES TRIES FOR A WIDER APPEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The first impression of Steve Forbes's presidential
campaign is that he seems little changed from his failed 1996
effort. He has many of the same sound bites. He promotes the same
17 percent flat tax proposal, again disputing those who say it
especially benefits the wealthiest Americans. He retains the same
awkward, engaging smile.
</P>
<P>
   But the publisher of ``Forbes: A Capitalist's Tool,'' who
Tuesday filed his candidacy papers and campaigned in New Hampshire,
in fact has carefully retooled his strategy. The man who once
called Christian Coalition founder Pat Robertson a ``toothy flake''
now spends much of his time portraying himself as the true
religious conservative. The man who in 1996 suggested that only
late-term abortions be banned does not shy away from urging that
nearly all abortions be made illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, at a time when some consultants say a Republican can win
only by running toward the middle, Forbes is sprinting to the right
as fast as he can. Forbes, whose net worth has been estimated
between $500 million and $1 billion, is making a classic investment
gamble, investing millions of his dollars on one sector, wagering
that the conservative Republican activists will determine the
party's nominee.
</P>
<P>
   The effort to woo social conservatives is only part of Forbes's
new game plan. Like a businessman studying a company's failure,
Forbes has analyzed his failed 1996 bid and found that he was
destined for defeat because he relied too much on his money and too
little on grass-roots support. This time around, while Forbes
certainly will keep on spending his money, the big difference is
that the publisher has spent much of the past three years seeding
his operation with grass-roots supporters and hiring some of the
best political operatives money can buy.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I ran in '96, we were very late getting in,'' Forbes said
in an interview. ``We did not have the kind of grass-roots
organization in the early states. This time we will have the
ability to get grass-roots efforts in all of the early states.''
</P>
<P>
   The grass-roots support has not suddenly sprung up, but rather
has been carefully nurtured by Forbes through his creation three
years ago of a private group called ``Americans for Hope, Growth
and Opportunity.'' The group has 145,000 donors and members, many
of whom now are considered likely Forbes supporters. Significantly,
the group paid for campaign-style ads featuring Forbes that have
helped keep his message alive in key primary and caucus states.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes said his effort to reach out to members of groups such as
the Christian Coalition does not mean he has had a change of heart
on social and religious issues. Instead, Forbes said, the move
reflects his frustration in 1996 at being unable to get past what
he considers the unfair opposition to his candidacy by leaders of
some conservative groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time I went to the rank and file,'' Forbes said.
</P>
<P>
   In some respects, the 2000 campaign is tailor-made for a
candidate such as Forbes. The primaries are so front-loaded next
year that many analysts believe the nomination will be secured
within a few weeks after the first-in-the-nation New Hampshire
primary. Only two or three of the best-financed candidates are
likely to have the money to run simultaneous commercials in
California, New York, and other states that will all hold primaries
in a two-week period after New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   The potential trouble for Forbes is that he may be running the
right kind of campaign for 1996, but not for 2000. Tuesday, for
example, Forbes stood in front of the New Hampshire State House in
Concord and signed a pledge against enacting new taxes at a time
when the state is changing its attitude on the issue, as indicated
by the legislature's recent move toward passage of the first income
tax.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, meanwhile, still faces many of the same questions from
1996 about whether his tax plan mostly benefits the rich. Notably,
Forbes did not directly address that question on his campaign web
page, which was introduced with much fanfare Tuesday. (The site is:
http://www.forbes2000.com).
</P>
<P>
   The web page, for example, provides a chart that explains the
benefits for families earning $70,000 or less, but it does not say
how it will affect those making more than that. That is a telling
omission, according to Robert McIntyre, director of the
labor-backed Citizens for Tax Justice.
</P>
<P>
   According to Forbes, the flat tax will result in the elimination
of income taxes for those earning $30,000 or less, a 70 percent cut
for those earning $40,000, and a 27 percent cut for those earning
$70,000.
</P>
<P>
   But McIntyre said all people in those groups could wind up
paying more taxes because of levies on health insurance benefits
and other items. Moreover, McIntyre said, wealthier people,
especially those earning more than $185,000, would get huge tax
cuts because Forbes would eliminate the tax on capital gains,
dividends, and interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is huge at the high end; if you are a millionaire, your
tax cut would be in the hundreds of thousands of dollars,''
McIntyre said. ``The top marginal rate of 39.6 percent would come
down to 17 percent, and his plan to eliminate the tax on capital
gains, interest, and dividends means there would be no tax on much
of the rich's income.''
</P>
<P>
   McIntyre said he is also troubled by the estimated $200
billion-a-year drain on the Treasury that he said would result from
the plan. Forbes has countered that the tax cut would unleash so
much money and enterprise that government revenues could actually
increase.
</P>
<P>
   To allay fears that his plan would raise taxes, Forbes said
taxpayers would have the option of filing under the flat system or
the old progressive rate.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes also is bound to face questions about how the plan will
affect him personally. In 1996, Forbes's holdings were reported by
Fortune magazine at around $440 million, and some analysts say the
soaring stock market of the past several years may have doubled
that amount. Forbes declined to say how much he is worth, but one
of his spokesmen, Greg Mueller, put it this way: ``The Clinton
economy has been good for a lot of people, no question about it.''
</P>
<P>
   That raises the question of whether a candidate selling a
Reaganesque vision of a tax cut and supply-side economics can
succeed when the economy is rolling along. Mueller said that while
times are good, there is so much uncertainty in markets such as
Asia that the time is ripe for a person with Forbes's experience on
Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Win or lose, Forbes may be the 800-pound gorilla in the race
whom no one can ignore. That is because Forbes has proven he is
willing to spend his money on some of the most negative campaign
commercials in recent campaign history, which in 1996 helped doom
the candidacy of Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
   While Forbes's ads were effective against his opponents, they
also appeared to have backfired, transforming Forbes's image from a
straight-talking outsider into just another attack dog politician.
Forbes, however, would not rule out running similar ads next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would think that the worst thing in the world he could do is
go and launch an (ad war) against some other candidate,'' said
Republican consultant Stuart Stevens, who worked for Dole in 1996.
``The guy would simply sit there on the launch pad and blow up. He
wouldn't get any altitude at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes will get altitude, however, by implementing his plan to
get around the $1,000-per-person federal limit on campaign
contributions. He says he will contribute his own unlimited funds
and will avoid spending restrictions by refusing to accept federal
matching funds. As a result, Forbes theoretically could spend more
than the rest of the combined Republican field. That has prompted
Texas Governor George W. Bush to say that he might also refuse
matching funds, setting the stage for what likely will be the most
expensive presidential campaign in history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did assure my five daughters I wouldn't spend a penny more
than necessary,'' Forbes said, as he laughed and declined to be
more specific.

 SERB-HELD TOWN SHOWS DARK SIDE OF MILITANCY
 &HT;    (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   FOCA, Bosnia-Herzegovina _ It may be a cynical joke _ or a
serious warning. The first thing a visitor sees upon crossing the
bridge into Foca are the words ``Mafija Centar'' _ Mafia Center _
spray-painted on the side of a building.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the most defiantly pro-Serbian towns in Republika
Srpska, the Serb-controlled sector of Bosnia, Western visitors are
not welcome. The New York-based Human Rights Watch describes Foca
as ``a closed, dark place'' and the previous, if not current,
hideout of several war crime suspects.
</P>
<P>
   As an international force struggles to maintain peace in this
former Yugoslav territory, where hundreds of thousands of people
died during a brutal 3 1/2-year war, Bosnia remains tense. The
rival ethnic groups of Serbs, Croats, and Muslims share the land,
but in bitter separation and mutual distrust. Foca, tucked in the
southern corner of the Serb-run fragment, is a glaring example of
how much needs to be done to return this region to a peaceful state
safe for all three ethnic groups, observers say.
</P>
<P>
   French soldiers in NATO's Stabilization Force warn Western
journalists not to stay after dark in Foca, which the Serbs call
Srbinje. Anti-Western sentiments there have been at an all-time
high, officials and aid workers say, since the NATO troops shot and
killed the war crimes suspect Dragan Gagovic in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people here are united'' in solidarity with their
neighbors, including those who may be wanted for mass rapes and
other war crimes, said Radisar Mashic, head of the local radio
station. He proudly passed out hand-drawn postcards of the mountain
town, then told visitors, ``Of course, your safety here cannot be
guaranteed.''
</P>
<P>
   Foca, whose population was mostly Muslim before the 1992-95 war,
is almost all Serbian now, and the few applications submitted by
Muslims who want to return to their homes have not been processed,
local officials and aid workers say.
</P>
<P>
   ``A civil war is a dirty war, and a lot of dirty things
happened,'' said Llubo Veljovic, the president, or mayor, of Foca.
``There were crimes on each side,'' he added, refusing to answer
directly whether his neighbors committed what international
monitors say were some of the most brutal atrocities of the war.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, a collection of Serb civilian, police and military
hard-liners took over Foca, using a propaganda campaign to convince
local Serbs that they were in danger of a Muslim fundamentalist
coup, according to a report by Human Rights Watch. The group,
calling itself the ``Crisis Committee,'' established a network of
detention centers where non-Serbs were detained, tortured or raped,
and then expelled, killed or ``disappeared'' from Foca, the report
concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Nine local men _ including now-dead Gagovic _ have been accused
of war crimes, and the ``wanted poster'' issued by the
international tribunal that is trying charges of war crimes in the
Hague includes five men whose last known address was Foca. Though
no one in the current political leadership is on the public list of
indicted suspects, it is impossible to know whether any are on the
tribunal's secret list.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic tension and violence are nothing new in Foca. During
World War II, it was the scene of assaults and killings by both
Serbian nationalists (known as Cetniks), and Croatian Nazi
sympathizers (the Ustashe), said Colin Soloway, political analyst
for the Sarajevo-based International Crisis Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of bad memories in that area'' that only serve
to heighten the boiling ethnic hatred, he said. Foca also has
strategic importance, he added, since it was a gateway from
landlocked Serbia to the Croatian port of Dubrovnik, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But now, the town ``is run by war criminals, basically,''
Soloway said. ``It's really a thugocracy. Foca is run by rackets
and criminal gangs,'' and locals not affiliated with the gangs live
in constant fear, he said.
</P>
<P>
   To an outsider, even on a short visit, Foca oozes hostility.
When two Westerners entered a local cafe recently, the music
literally stopped, and all heads turned to glare at the strangers.
</P>
<P>
   Death notices honoring Gagovic, the alleged war criminal, are
pasted all over town, with the notation that he was ``killed in a
sneaky way by NATO troops.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a great deal of distrust toward (NATO troops) and
the international community'' since Gagovic's death, said Veljovic,
the municipal president. On his office door is a sticker with the
face of Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, another war crimes
suspect. ``Don't Touch Him!'' it reads.
</P>
<P>
   Balkan watchers say an international presence throughout Bosnia
is critical to keeping the shaky peace. But since the Gagovic
episode, few foreigners come to Foca, except for the armored French
vehicles that patrol the town during the day.
</P>
<P>
   The Organization on Security and Cooperation in Europe, one of
the international groups monitoring the fragile peace, has closed
its Foca office for safety reasons. So has the International Police
Training Force, which was brought in to train the local police.
</P>
<P>
   After Gagovic was shot, locals trashed the office of the police
training force, which remains empty. Humanitarian aid workers are
afraid to go into Foca and operate from nearby towns, venturing
here only occasionally, and only in daylight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We regret'' the destruction of the police training office, the
town president said. ``But you have to look at the cause.''
</P>
<P>
   Locals are furious at the death of Gagovic, who had five
youngsters in his car when he was shot. ``Couldn't they just shoot
four flat tires?'' asked Veljovic, who had been a good friend of
Gagovic.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Chamberlain, the stabilization force's spokesman, said
Gagovic tried to speed through a checkpoint to avoid arrest. ``He
was using his car as a weapon,'' Chamberlain said.
</P>
<P>
   If international troops attempt more arrests, Foca's residents
will defend their neighbors, predicted Mashic, the radio station
owner.
</P>
<P>
   The very existence of a secret list of indicted war criminals
rankles deeply here. It ``doesn't fit a civilized Europe,'' said
Veljovic. ``How do I know I am not on the secret list?''

 N.H. DOMESTIC ABUSE CASE GOES FORWARD AGAINST VICTIM'S WISHES
 &HT;    (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   DOVER, N.H. _ Robin Needham looked haggard that afternoon last
June when she tearfully described how her boyfriend beat and raped
her in the early morning hours.
</P>
<P>
   Needham's upper lip and nose were swollen and red. She hadn't
slept or showered and it showed as she haltingly answered questions
on videotape for a solid hour while a police detective looked on
from another room.
</P>
<P>
   Days later, she recanted: she was drunk, she explained. She hit
him, she said. There was no rape, no attack.
</P>
<P>
   It was, some rueful observers concluded, just one more example
of a battered woman defending her abuser, a pattern as predictable
as the nearby tides.
</P>
<P>
   But rather than simply drop the case, frustrated prosecutors,
convinced that Needham was a victim of both her violent boyfriend
and misplaced loyalty, did something surprising: They tried the
case anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the boyfriend, 26-year-old Terry Johnson, is locked up in
the Strafford County Jail facing the possibility that he will spend
the next 40 years of his life in state prison. Attorneys on both
sides of the case agree that his appeal will reach the state
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   And Needham, who testified in defense of her boyfriend, but
whose videotaped complaint was used to convict him _ is on the
verge of giving birth to Johnson's baby, their second child
together and her fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not right that he's in jail,'' she said. ``The
allegations are false. He's an innocent man and he shouldn't be
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Observers nationwide are watching this case with deep interest.
The Needham case is part of a nationwide trend toward ``victimless
prosecutions,'' according to Sandra Matheson, director of
victim-witness assistance in the New Hampshire attorney general's
office. But this case takes that logic one step further, because of
the judge's controversial decision to allow the jury to see the
videotaped complaint that the witness later disavowed _ a decision
which, if upheld, could give prosecutors a powerful new tool.
</P>
<P>
   ``It represents a historic reversal where the advice from police
was to avoid getting involved,'' said Murray A. Straus, who is
co-director of the Family Research Laboratory at the University of
New Hampshire, and who has been conducting national surveys on
domestic violence since 1975. ``The old training manual said,
separate the warring parties and get out of there as fast as you
can.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is also bound to spark a vigorous debate in the courts.
``This is novel and basically reverses several hundred years of
Anglo-Saxon jurisprudence by permitting an out-of-court statement
to convict a person,'' said John E. Durkin, Johnson's attorney in
the New Hampshire public defender's office.
</P>
<P>
   Still, county attorney Lincoln Soldati, frustrated at having
been unable to help battered women because they refuse to
cooperate, has no such second thoughts. It is common, he said, for
women to recant or blame themselves when they have a violent bond
with their boyfriend or husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very sad case in a lot of ways, and unfortunately, it's
quite typical of what we see in domestic violence cases,'' said
Soldati, without regret. ``I have no misgivings about the case.''
</P>
<P>
   The relationship between Needham and Johnson was passionate from
the beginning. The two met at a club in Dover called Pure Platinum,
Needham recalled. She didn't like him at first, she said, but he
quickly won her over.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just exchanged numbers and the next day he came over and he
was living with me from then on,'' said Needham.
</P>
<P>
   Violence did not become a part of the relationship, said
Needham, until the young couple moved from Kittery to Sanford,
Maine, about six months after they met. She was pregnant, she said,
and he was having an affair with another woman. The two fought and,
she said, she was just as much to blame as was he.
</P>
<P>
   The night that put Johnson in jail _ which was not his first
incarceration on charges of beating Needham _ began with another
argument over another woman, said Needham. When she told the police
that June night that Johnson had beat and raped her, she was
motivated by revenge, she told the jury. She had been drinking, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   But the jury believed the prosecution and found Johnson guilty
of four counts of aggravated felonious sexual assault, one count of
simple assault, and one count of violating a restraining order.
Johnson is scheduled to be sentenced on March 29.
</P>
<P>
   Specialists in domestic violence say her change of heart is
typical of an abusive relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Battered women really love their abusers,'' said Grace
Mattern, executive director of the New Hampshire Coalition Against
Domestic and Sexual Violence.
</P>
<P>
   Needham and Johnson, though, are strenuously insisting that
justice has gone awry. Needham, in fact, was so aggravated that she
called her local newspaper, Foster's Daily Democrat, to say her
boyfriend was innocent and insist that she had lied.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm angry because I feel like I'm getting nowhere,'' she said
Wednesday, sitting at a table in her kitchen while a friend minded
her three girls, ages 7, 4, and 16 months, in the next room.
</P>
<P>
   During a telephone interview from prison, Johnson said the
experience has made him see more clearly. He now freely admits that
he had been having an affair behind Needham's back, and he said he
was drinking and doing drugs, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's a God, and I know there is, he put me here because
he said, `Terry, you have to wake up, you have to do the right
thing and take care of your family and stop living this other
life.' I'm not mad at anybody. I just feel I was unfairly
convicted.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he loves Needham and forgives her for what she did
to him. He also said he feels a terrible pain that he cannot be
with his girlfriend for the birth of their child.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel like I got justice. I feel I got shafted because
I did not commit this crime,'' he said. ``If things don't work out,
I've got to serve the rest of my life for something I did not do.''
</P>
<P>
   With Johnson in prison, instead of working as a stocker at an
Exeter warehouse, no money is coming into the household. Last
Tuesday, Needham received an eviction notice to leave her modest,
third-floor walk-up on the edge of town.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want him to come home,'' she said, insisting that she had
changed and so had Johnson. ``It won't happen anymore. It won't be
abusive anymore. He's seeking the Lord and I'm not drinking
anymore.''

that the publisher has spent much of the past three years seeding
his operation with grass-roots supporters and hiring some of the
best political operatives money can buy.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I ran in '96, we were very late getting in,'' Forbes said
in an interview. ``We did not have the kind of grass-roots
organization in the early states. This time we will have the
ability to get grass-roots efforts in all of the early states.''
</P>
<P>
   The grass-roots support has not suddenly sprung up, but rather
has been carefully nurtured by Forbes through his creation three
years ago of a private group called ``Americans for Hope, Growth
and Opportunity.'' The group has 145,000 donors and members, many
of whom now are considered likely Forbes supporters. Significantly,
the group paid for campaign-style ads featuring Forbes that have
helped keep his message alive in key primary and caucus states.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes said his effort to reach out to members of groups such as
the Christian Coalition does not mean he has had a change of heart
on social and religious issues. Instead, Forbes said, the move
reflects his frustration in 1996 at being unable to get past what
he considers the unfair opposition to his candidacy by leaders of
some conservative groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time I went to the rank and file,'' Forbes said.
</P>
<P>
   In some respects, the 2000 campaign is tailor-made for a
candidate such as Forbes. The primaries are so front-loaded next
year that many analysts believe the nomination will be secured
within a few weeks after the first-in-the-nation New Hampshire
primary. Only two or three of the best-financed candidates are
likely to have the money to run simultaneous commercials in
California, New York, and other states that will all hold primaries
in a two-week period after New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   The potential trouble for Forbes is that he may be running the
right kind of campaign for 1996, but not for 2000. Tuesday, for
example, Forbes stood in front of the New Hampshire State House in
Concord and signed a pledge against enacting new taxes at a time
when the state is changing its attitude on the issue, as indicated
by the legislature's recent move toward passage of the first income
tax.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, meanwhile, still faces many of the same questions from
1996 about whether his tax plan mostly benefits the rich. Notably,
Forbes did not directly address that question on his campaign web
page, which was introduced with much fanfare Tuesday. (The site is:
http://www.forbes2000.com).
</P>
<P>
   The web page, for example, provides a chart that explains the
benefits for families earning $70,000 or less, but it does not say
how it will affect those making more than that. That is a telling
omission, according to Robert McIntyre, director of the
labor-backed Citizens for Tax Justice.
</P>
<P>
   According to Forbes, the flat tax will result in the elimination
of income taxes for those earning $30,000 or less, a 70 percent cut
for those earning $40,000, and a 27 percent cut for those earning
$70,000.
</P>
<P>
   But McIntyre said all people in those groups could wind up
paying more taxes because of levies on health insurance benefits
and other items. Moreover, McIntyre said, wealthier people,
especially those earning more than $185,000, would get huge tax
cuts because Forbes would eliminate the tax on capital gains,
dividends, and interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is huge at the high end; if you are a millionaire, your
tax cut would be in the hundreds of thousands of dollars,''
McIntyre said. ``The top marginal rate of 39.6 percent would come
down to 17 percent, and his plan to eliminate the tax on capital
gains, interest, and dividends means there would be no tax on much
of the rich's income.''
</P>
<P>
   McIntyre said he is also troubled by the estimated $200
billion-a-year drain on the Treasury that he said would result from
the plan. Forbes has countered that the tax cut would unleash so
much money and enterprise that government revenues could actually
increase.
</P>
<P>
   To allay fears that his plan would raise taxes, Forbes said
taxpayers would have the option of filing under the flat system or
the old progressive rate.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes also is bound to face questions about how the plan will
affect him personally. In 1996, Forbes's holdings were reported by
Fortune magazine at around $440 million, and some analysts say the
soaring stock market of the past several years may have doubled
that amount. Forbes declined to say how much he is worth, but one
of his spokesmen, Greg Mueller, put it this way: ``The Clinton
economy has been good for a lot of people, no question about it.''
</P>
<P>
   That raises the question of whether a candidate selling a
Reaganesque vision of a tax cut and supply-side economics can
succeed when the economy is rolling along. Mueller said that while
times are good, there is so much uncertainty in markets such as
Asia that the time is ripe for a person with Forbes's experience on
Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Win or lose, Forbes may be the 800-pound gorilla in the race
whom no one can ignore. That is because Forbes has proven he is
willing to spend his money on some of the most negative campaign
commercials in recent campaign history, which in 1996 helped doom
the candidacy of Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
   While Forbes's ads were effective against his opponents, they
also appeared to have backfired, transforming Forbes's image from a
straight-talking outsider into just another attack dog politician.
Forbes, however, would not rule out running similar ads next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would think that the worst thing in the world he could do is
go and launch an (ad war) against some other candidate,'' said
Republican consultant Stuart Stevens, who worked for Dole in 1996.
``The guy would simply sit there on the launch pad and blow up. He
wouldn't get any altitude at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes will get altitude, however, by implementing his plan to
get around the $1,000-per-person federal limit on campaign
contributions. He says he will contribute his own unlimited funds
and will avoid spending restrictions by refusing to accept federal
matching funds. As a result, Forbes theoretically could spend more
than the rest of the combined Republican field. That has prompted
Texas Governor George W. Bush to say that he might also refuse
matching funds, setting the stage for what likely will be the most
expensive presidential campaign in history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did assure my five daughters I wouldn't spend a penny more
than necessary,'' Forbes said, as he laughed and declined to be
more specific.

 By LARRY TYE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ Hospital executives used to blanch when the
conversation turned to medical errors. Now they're the ones
bringing them up.
</P>
<P>
   The particular errors aren't any easier to acknowledge, but
there's a growing realization that the problem is so widespread and
deep-seated that it can no longer be avoided _ and that mistakes
are relatively easy to prevent.
</P>
<P>
   The upshot is that in Cleveland, hospitals are publishing their
failure rates on everything from cesarean sections to bowel
resections, so would-be patients can compare. In Philadelphia,
they're installing computers in doctors' offices to teach them how
to avoid mistakes. And in Boston they're pioneering software that
makes it almost impossible to prescribe too many drugs, or too few.
</P>
<P>
   America's most ambitious laboratory for error-proofing a
hospital, however, is here at the base of Utah's Wasatch Mountains.
Doctors at LDS Hospital have waged a 15-year war against mistakes,
and they now have 60 models that are being applied from Austria to
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   They started with simple things, like seeing whether patients
were getting antibiotics during the critical two hours before
surgery. Everyone knew that would reduce infections, but they also
found that in the typical pre-operative tumult the drugs were given
too early or too late. When they finally got the timing down, the
infection rate fell by a factor of four.
</P>
<P>
   Same with pneumonia. Doctors at rural clinics began paying more
attention to using the right drugs at the right time _ and saved 20
lives in the first year alone.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson in those and other cases was startlingly simple:
Doctors and nurses typically know what to do, but hospitals are so
complex that things often don't get done right. Orders are issued,
but the key to rooting out errors is ensuring those orders are
carried out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The complexity of modern medicine makes it very difficult to
execute well,'' says Dr. Brent James, who spearheaded many of the
changes. ``I am convinced that we would see major improvements in
medical outcomes _ on the order of what new science like genetic
breakthroughs are likely to produce _ if we could just apply what
we already know consistently.''
</P>
<P>
   He isn't the only true believer. Dr. Arnold Milstein, who
advises California's biggest businesses on health issues, says that
``1999 is a great moment in history to take a leap forward in this
area of medical errors. The beauty of raising it now is that there
are solutions in our tool shed, they just aren't being utilized.
</P>
<P>
   ``Health plans are getting a wake-up call that the time is
limited during which they can continue to expose their hospitalized
patients to these kinds of avoidable errors. It's the end of an
era.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals institute
</P>
<P>
   corrective measures &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bay State hospitals were among the first to get the message, and
to act on it.
</P>
<P>
   The easiest place to measure the results is at places like
Franciscan Children's Hospital in Brighton, which experienced one
of the most tragic cases of things going wrong. The death there in
1996 of Alexis Masiello, a 2 1/2-year-old who slowly suffocated
after her breathing tube became disconnected, led officials to
overhaul equipment and policies.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital replaced most of its old-style ventilators. It
installed a network that lets nurses check a patient's condition
from a computer screen in every other patient's room and that
filters out some of the false alarms that may have delayed the
response to Masiello. And glass walls replaced concrete ones to
give nurses a better view into rooms with patients who need more
frequent checking.
</P>
<P>
   Procedures were transformed, too _ to make it more likely that
problems identified in areas like patient surveillance are
corrected, to ensure that nurses arrange for cross-coverage when
they're away from their patients, and to be certain that equipment
is maintained the way it is supposed to be.
</P>
<P>
   Since the hospital was unsure just what caused the slow response
to Masiello, it made changes that ``address the whole spectrum'' of
possibilities, explains Paul J. DellaRocco, Franciscan's president.
As for whether the financially-strapped hospital did the right
thing making such expensive changes, DellaRocco says that ``only
time will tell.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center have
been struggling with similar issues, trying to balance tight
budgets while putting into practice lessons learned from the 1997
death of Alexis's mother, Michele, at Memorial Hospital, which is
now part of the UMass hospital system. They have tightened
procedures for handling drug overdoses, revised the way they order
restraints, mandated more careful handoff of care from one nurse or
doctor to another, and otherwise sought to answer doubts the
Department of Public Health raised about their treatment of Michele
Masiello.
</P>
<P>
   In those cases and others, hospitals have followed a basic
formula: Ferret out the systems and people at the root of the
problem, then figure out how to prevent not just that mistake but
any that are related.
</P>
<P>
   At Massachusetts General Hospital, doctors and nurses ran such a
root-cause analysis last year after Charles Merritt Jr., a
79-year-old chemist from Winthrop, went into a coma and later died
after doctors treated him for a stroke when he really was having an
insulin reaction. The hospital upgraded its operations to ensure
that laboratory results get to caregivers quicker and more
accurately, that everyone understands the needs of
insulin-dependent patients, and that other things that went wrong
with Merritt are less likely to happen again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't find epiphanies in most of these cases. We find
tweaking, continuous tweaking,'' explains Maryanne Spicer, Mass
General's compliance chief.
</P>
<P>
   Good hospitals generally don't tweak their operations only after
something goes wrong; they do it all the time as part of the health
care industry's new mantra of continuous quality improvement. CQI
means putting in place as many fail-safe systems as possible, and
finetuning them even when they seem to be working. And it means
``making the right thing to do, the easiest thing to do, whether
it's in the doctor's office, the emergency room or the operating
room,'' says Dr. James Reinertsen, a long-time advocate of quality
improvement and the chief executive officer of CareGroup, the
parent company of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to make it hard to make a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   They're trying the same thing at Brigham and Women's Hospital,
the Mayo Clinic, Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, the University of
Pennsylvania Medical Center, and scores of other facilities here
and around the nation. And it's not just big hospitals that are
pushing hard on the error-prevention front, although they are more
likely to have the resources to experiment with new and
often-costly systems.
</P>
<P>
   At the 118-bed Sturdy Memorial Hospital in Attleboro, members of
the hospital staff have been testing creative ways to cut errors
since 1995, well before it became a priority in the wider world of
medicine. They devised 20 fail-safe systems for drug orders alone,
along with ways to make sure the wrong limbs are not operated on
and the right X-Rays are shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Little hospitals can do it faster and safer,'' says Linda
Shyavitz, Sturdy's president. ``We joke that we're really glad that
Nike gave up its old motto because now we can use it: Just Do
It.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Drive is on to
</P>
<P>
   prevent errors &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As ambitious as the efforts of individual hospitals are, the
movement against medical mistakes is likely to become even more
intense and effective in the near future. That's partly because the
oft-criticized hospital regulators are making the prevention of
errors a major priority, and because big state and national groups
are joining the battle.
</P>
<P>
   The American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons recognized that it
is not just a tragedy for the patient when a doctor cuts off the
wrong leg or repairs the wrong knee, which happens about 50 times a
year nationwide. It's also embarrassing for doctors. So about a
year ago it began pushing its 16,000 members to use an indelible
pen to sign their initials on the limb they want to operate on, so
it would be almost impossible to mistake. A recent survey found
that 40 percent of academy members are following its advice.

   TAKE-ART-BOS  
 SALT LAKE CITY: ... its advice.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Other orthopedic surgeons have their own signature approaches to
minimizing errors, from writing ``no'' in big letters on the joint
or limb not to be done, to drawing an arrow pointing to the one
slated for surgery. Some place an ``x'' on the spot, but it's
sometimes unclear whether that's the limb to operate on or to
avoid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wrong-site surgery is something we can wipe out like we wiped
out polio,'' says Dr. S. Terry Canale, first vice president of the
academy and the leader of its signing drive. ``Most doctors who
don't do it don't know about it, or their ego is too big, or
they're too busy. The guy who is too busy is the guy we want to get
to, because he's the guy who's going to make the mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   The American Medical Association also is involved in
error-prevention, mainly through its three-year-old National
Patient Safety Foundation. It is spending about $5 million for
research on ways to enhance safety, and is laboring to get people
thinking and talking about the issue.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, the Coalition for the Prevention of Medical
Errors recently moved from the talking stage to the doing. The
group, founded two years ago and involving everyone from hospitals
and doctors to government regulators, this month told every Bay
State hospital about concrete things they can do to reduce
medication errors. Some are relatively quick and painless, like
using individual packages of medicine that contain just the dose
patients need, and ensuring a pharmacist is on-call even if one
isn't on duty; others are longer-term and more expensive, such as a
computerized drug-ordering system that eliminates the risk of
handwriting errors and catches incorrect dosing.
</P>
<P>
   And that's just the beginning. Hospitals soon will be getting
suggestions on ways to avoid operating on the wrong site, how and
when to use patient restraints, and other things the coalition
hopes will keep Massachusetts out in front of the error-prevention
movement.
</P>
<P>
   The drive to prevent errors is ``a comparable social movement to
underage smoking,'' says Andrew Dreyfus, executive vice president
of the Massachusetts Hospitals Association and a leader in the
coalition. ``It's a huge societal collaboration between health
organizations, schools, the media, etc. . . . And the stakes are at
least as high (as with smoking), if not higher.''
</P>
<P>
   Other groups offer other advice on ways to keep errors from
happening. The non-profit Institute for Safe Medication Practices
keeps tabs on the latest drug-related mistakes and tells hospitals
how to avoid them. The Joint Commission on Accreditation of
Healthcare Organizations is moving to let hospitals more easily
compare success and failure rates on procedures like heart bypass
surgery, which can signal if they are making more or fewer errors
than their counterparts nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Even the US Army is getting involved. It's sponsoring an
experiment to see whether lessons on performing under pressure that
were learned in commercial aviation can be applied to the equally
high-stress environment of a hospital emergency room. The answer so
far is an unequivocal yes, with errors dropping by as much as 80
percent after emergency department staffers are taught teamwork and
other approaches used by pilots.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot initiative, which includes Holy Family Hospital in
Methuen, ``is not a panacea,'' says Robert Simon, manager for the
project, which is being run for the Army by Dynamics Research
Corporation of Andover. ``But teamwork offers a lot of
opportunities to break the error chain.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Finding ways
</P>
<P>
   to make it safer &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Breaking the error chain has been a preoccupation bordering on
obsession for 15 years at LDS Hospital in Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   It may have something to do with the single-minded determination
of its original owners: the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
Saints, or Mormons. It may be the high standards key staffers here
learned while training at teaching hospitals in Boston, then
applied in Salt Lake City's competitive private hospital market. Or
it may be the fact that LDS linked up to computers so early and
exhaustively, installing a terminal in every patient's room 10
years ago and doing away with paper records, all of which gave it
such good measurements of patient care that it could easily assess
whether improvement schemes were yielding real improvements in
patient health.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, the result is a series of elegantly simple
and exceedingly effective ways of making basic treatments work
better.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the situation with surgical infections. Doctors here
and elsewhere have recognized for years that administering
antibiotics within the two-hour window before surgery could reduce
wound infections by a factor of four or more. But their studies
also showed that the drugs sometimes were administered in the
patient's room, other times in the waiting room or operating room.
The bottom line was that they were given at the right time just 40
percent of the time at LDS, which actually was better than at many
of Boston's biggest hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   The solution: nurses now set up a bag with antibiotics at the
same time that they start a patient on intravenous fluids, and
anesthesiologists turn on the antibiotics at the same time they
start their sedatives. The result: hospital compliance with the
two-hour rule soared from 40 to 99 percent, while its post-surgery
infection rate fell from 1.8 to 0.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For patients, that meant dozens of fewer cases each year of
painful, disfiguring, and sometimes deadly infection, while for the
hospital it meant an annual savings of $750,000 in treatment costs.
</P>
<P>
   The savings have been equally dramatic with a computer-order
system for drug prescriptions that not only catches doses that are
too high or low, but uses a patient's medical history to prevent
potentially dangerous allergic reactions. That cut by two-thirds
the number of severe drug errors and yielded the hospital a savings
of $500,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   In those cases and scores of others LDS doctors took a novel
approach: rather than looking to scientific breakthroughs or more
expensive machines and drugs to upgrade their care, they looked to
getting more from existing technologies and treatments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than put quality assurance in a quality assurance
department, it has become part of our practice and our research,''
explains Dr. David Classen, who set up the pioneering computer
system and helped concoct the error-resistant ways to execute
treatments. ``The model for all our work is, don't assert blame,
don't assign error. Find a problem and fix it.''

COLLECTORS TAKE A SHINE TO CRYSTAL WORLDS

By HARRY SHATTUCK 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WATTENS, Austria _ As in other parts of the world, Americans
have become serious collectors of tiny, intricately crafted
Swarovski Silver Crystal figures.
</P>
<P>
   Butterflies and bumblebees, penguins and pandas, trains and
planes and automobiles _ each miniature piece possesses an almost
magnetic appeal.
</P>
<P>
   And this represents only one small aspect of the crystal empire
founded more than a century ago by Daniel Swarovski in the small
town of Wattens, about a 30-minute commuter-bus ride west from
Innsbruck in the Austrian Tyrol.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Swarovski's legacy is heralded at the spectacular
subterranean Crystal Worlds, situated in the shadow of the company
headquarters where Swarovski crystal is still cut. It is one of
Austria's most popular tourist attractions, with 2 million visitors
since its opening in late 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Distinct lighting, music and architecture combine to generate a
surreal atmosphere within a labyrinth of rooms and passages
designed to showcase crystal in previously unexplored dimensions.
</P>
<P>
   Designer Andre Heller described his objective as ``an attempt to
create a contemporary chamber of wonders; a collection of rooms to
astonish and amuse, rooms that would serve both as force fields and
sources of inspiration for those with sensitivity to respond to
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Suffice it to say this is not your typical museum or exhibition
center.
</P>
<P>
   The entrance is through the head of a crystal-eyed ``giant'' _ a
masterpiece of landscaped art on an artificial hill _ that spouts
water into a small pool.
</P>
<P>
   Among the first displays is the world's largest crystal stone,
15 inches in diameter, weighing 300,000 carats.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby rests the world's smallest stone, three-hundredths of an
inch in diameter and observable under a microscope.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the entrance foyer: a stele, or stone slab, decorated
with black cut crystal stones by U.S. graffiti artist Keith Haring;
love poems written on rings of crystal by John Brekke; Salvador
Dali's famous ``Time Running Out'' pendulum clock done in crystal;
a Statue of Liberty figure by Niki de St. Phalle (with a huge
crystal piece replacing the flame); and two paintings by Andy
Warhol titled ``Gems.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially striking is a wall packed with 12 tons of crystal
stone, rising more than 12 feet from the floor and extending more
than 50 feet in width.
</P>
<P>
   Most rooms and passages were redesigned late last year. Among
them:
</P>
<P>
   _ A spiritual Planet of Crystals is touted as the world's first
three-dimensional theaterlike spectacle that can be perceived
without technical aids. Sparkling crystals are in perpetual motion
above and below the observer. A cosmic soundscape helps give the
impression of a walk through space.
</P>
<P>
   _ In the Crystal Dome, 590 mirrors create the illusion of being
inside a giant crystal.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Kaleidoscope Room offers insight into the infinite variety
of the crystalline image. Eight different kaleidoscope systems
employ media ranging from water to shards of glass.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Crystal Theater is a bizarre fairy-tale setting of motion
and color in which diverse figures are decorated with crystal
stones.
</P>
<P>
   _ In the Crystal Calligraphy room, blown-glass tubes climb the
wall in letterlike shapes.
</P>
<P>
   _ An ``ice passage`` is paved with crystal cubes of 30 facets,
with images changing each time the floor is touched. As more people
move about, whatever is seen is dissolved only to come back in
changed shapes and colors.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Eno Room is a chapellike environment and features a cross
section of the pulsating light, sound and video objects developed
by composer-producer Brian Eno, co-founder of the Roxy Music pop
group and acclaimed for his work with David Bowie, U2 and other
artists. Chairs are provided for meditation.
</P>
<P>
   Crystal Worlds was created to commemorate Swarovski's 100th
anniversary in 1995. A native of Bohemia, Daniel Swarovski settled
in the Austrian Tyrol region and developed a machine that cut
crystal jewelry stones with new precision. The company _ now headed
by fourth-generation Swarovski family members _ is the world's
leading manufacturer of full cut crystal, the largest supplier of
crystal jewelry stones for the fashion, jewelry, lighting and
cosmetics industries and also specializes in optical precision
instruments and grinding tools.
</P>
<P>
   Production of a tiny crystal mouse in 1976 marked the beginning
of the Silver Crystal line of collectibles. Several miniature
pieces are created _ and others retired _ annually, and about
400,000 individuals have joined the Swarovski Collectors Society.
</P>
<P>
   Society members are admitted free to Crystal Worlds, receive
exclusive access to a VIP lounge and qualify for a discount on
purchases in the facility's large gift shop. (Prices for individual
pieces are generally lower in Austria than in the United States.)
</P>
<P>
   Tours are offered in several languages, including English, when
demand is sufficient. Or ask for a printed guide in English and
proceed through chambers at your preferred pace. Regular adult
admission is 75 Austrian shillings (about $6 in U.S. currency),
with discounts for groups of 10 or more. Children under 12 are
admitted free when accompanied by an adult. The facility is
wheelchair-accessible. Hours are 9 a.m.-6 p.m. daily except
Christmas and New Year's days.
</P>
<P>
   Save some time for exploring the surrounding grounds. One
highlight on the side of the artificial hill is a maze of trees
modeled after designer Heller's left hand. Nearby is a children's
playground and park.
</P>
<P>
   To reach Crystal Worlds by car from Innsbruck, take Highway A12
to the Wattens exit and follow the brown signs that read
Kristallwelten (about two minutes from the highway). Parking is
free. Or buses marked ``Wattens'' depart about every 30 minutes
from a terminal adjacent to the Innsbruck train station. Some
walking is involved from the closest bus stop.
</P>
<P>
   Several restaurants and cafes offer tasty and inexpensive
lunches in downtown Wattens, about a 10-minute walk (or short bus
ride) from Crystal Worlds.

ONE TOWN'S GUARDIAN; SAFE SHOTS; SHAPED BY TV 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   My only run-in with the law occurred when I was 11 or so and
joined a bunch of other desperadoes one weekend in the liberation
of some ice cream bars from a freezer in our elementary school.
</P>
<P>
   I've been more or less rehabilitated since then, but I'll never
forget that squirmy, shamed feeling when a police officer we all
respected, a fixture in our lives, sat us down for a good
talking-to. It was as if we had let (itals)him(unitals) down.
</P>
<P>
   A good cop can wield that kind of moral authority, and can
generally occupy a special place in the life of a small town.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy O'Connor of Northampton, Mass. was one such good cop, at
least as depicted by Tracy Kidder in a wonderful excerpt from his
new book, ``Home Town,'' in the April issue of The Atlantic
Monthly.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor was the kind of cop who radiated enough menace to put
the fear of God into the toughest gang members, and enough
compassion to warn a disabled junkie about some dangerous smack
circulating on the street. Before he left in 1997 to join the FBI,
he was part of the town's social glue, responding cheerfully to
situations lesser cops might blow off: a dog locked in a car, a kid
throwing snowballs at passing cars, an accident victim needing some
follow-up at the local hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The Northampton that O'Connor patrolled day after day was a
different place than the Northampton he grew up in, but that didn't
stop him, Kidder writes, from ``playing ombudsman to the lost, the
needy, the unsteady, in his home town.''
</P>
<P>
   Kidder's gift is to show us the town through O'Connor's eyes and
the cop himself through the author's eyes. To judge by the 90-point
byline they give him on the cover, the editors of the Atlantic are
mighty glad to have Kidder back in their magazine. Readers should
be too.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   In this era of celebrity worship, when magazine sales can hinge
on which famous face adorns the cover, the publicists who control
access to the stars have gotten drunk with power _ and it is
editors and photographers who suffer the hangover.
</P>
<P>
   That's the tale told by a Hollywood-based magazine editor who
complains in American Photo that megalomaniacal publicists are
``the number-one issue affecting the profession.'' The editor
(writing under a pseudonym for fear of retribution at the hands of
vengeful flacks) says showbiz publicists demand veto power over the
photographers whom magazines wish to assign; pressure photographers
to sign away their right to pictures without compensation; and
insist on controlling every aspect of photo shoots, issuing orders
regarding the makeup, wardrobe, and hairstyles for their clients
(at the magazines' expense).
</P>
<P>
   This could all be just inside baseball were it not for the fact
that the flacks' mania for control is robbing us readers of any
magazine photography with a vestige of spontaneity. ``Look at your
nearest newsstand: All the faces are perfect,'' the editor notes.
``All the covers are interchangeable.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TV history is hot these days, what with Entertainment Weekly
recently publishing a pair of special issues devoted to the ``100
greatest moments in television'' and the ``100 greatest TV shows of
all time.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Life, the picture magazine, pays homage to the picture
medium with Todd Brewster's pithy summation of the ways TV has
transformed America. This is meant for a quick skim; a much fuller
exploration of these themes is contained in Steven D. Stark's
indispensable ``Glued to the Set: The 60 Television Shows and
Events That Made Us Who We Are Today.'' But Brewster, a producer of
ABC News' upcoming ``The Century'' documentary series, is not a bad
field guide to television's milestones and their meaning (though
his ABC affiliation does make a reader wonder about the shot he
takes at CBS's Dan Rather).
</P>
<P>
   Brewster rightly points out that ``when people in Maine looked
at the same thing as people in California night after night, a
different sense of nationhood was imprinted on our consciousness.''
Given the disintegration of network television's hold on that
consciousness, it appears that another change in our cultural
identity is in store.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The occupation of bounty hunter has always seemed like a
fascinating anachronism, a holdover from the Wild West days. That
impression is further fortified by Harmon Leon's report in P.O.V.
on his brief undercover stint as one.
</P>
<P>
   Bounty hunters chase fugitives, or ``skips'' as they are called,
and sometimes the encounters prove deadly. When Leon asks his
instructor why bounty hunters can't just shoot at the fugitives'
kneecaps, the instructor ``stares me down like I'm a yellow-bellied
wimp'' and barks: ``There is no `shoot to wound' or `in the
kneecaps.' You shoot to kill!''
</P>
<P>
   Also in P.O.V., celebrated figures opine on what the magazine is
pleased to call the ``seven vital virtues'' (in contrast to the
seven deadly sins, get it?). So we get moderately interesting
essays from Norman Mailer on audacity, Sammy Sosa on sportsmanship,
America Online chairman Steve Case on perseverance, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   Poignantly, we also hear from Joe Torre on the virtue of
patience. The Yankees manager notes that it took him 37 years in
the major leagues to win a World Series and says that ``no matter
what happens to me from now on, nothing is going to rain on my
parade.'' Thursday Torre is scheduled to undergo surgery for his
recently diagnosed prostate cancer.

DAUBACH IS A LATE BOOMER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: Ill.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ He was 18 years old when the New York Mets
made him their 19th-round draft pick in 1990. Brian Daubach was the
first (and still is the only) kid ever drafted out of Belleville
West (Ill.) High School, which made him kind of a big deal.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, casual sports fans and well-meaning family and
friends don't know how it works after a young man is drafted. They
assume that when you are selected by a big league team, you will be
playing in the majors the next year. They look for your name in the
box scores right after you leave home.
</P>
<P>
   What they don't know is that only a small fraction of those who
sign professional contracts ever see a day in the majors. Instead,
most of these young men live a life of long bus rides, fast-food
restaurants, and hanging curveballs. The road to the majors is
paved with bush league body parts _ the sore arms and broken hearts
of those who never made it.
</P>
<P>
   And that is why those friends and relatives don't know how much
it can hurt when they ask, ``What happened to Brian? Why isn't he
playing for the Mets yet?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I get that a lot,'' says Daubach, now a 27-year-old first
base/outfield hopeful in the Red Sox' Camp Tranquility. ``But it's
out of your control. People don't understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Daubach's dad, Dale, is a letter carrier for the US Postal
Service in Belleville.
</P>
<P>
   ``People (itals)don't(unitals) understand,'' agrees Dale
Daubach. ``They think he should have been in the big leagues by
now. But Brian loves it. He wouldn't want to do anything else. Even
if he had to keep playing minor league ball, he'd be happy.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no time for a big sendoff party when Brian got drafted
nine years ago. Within a week, the kid was off to play for the
Mets' affiliate in the Gulf Coast League. He hit .270 there, then
the trail took him through Kingsport, Pittsfield, Capital City, St.
Lucie, Birmingham, Norfolk, and Charlotte. Brian kept the folks
posted with regular phone calls, and the local paper trailed his
career.
</P>
<P>
   He never has been married. This helps. There was a regular girl
a few years ago, but this is no life for a young married couple.
Daubach is certain that if he'd married, he would have given up
baseball. He says the minor league life is lonely, but you can get
by on $18-per-day meal money. And there's no family to move from
Fort Myers to Pawtucket to Boston.
</P>
<P>
   A late bloomer, Daubach found his power stroke three years ago.
He hit 26 homers in 1996 and 21 in '97. Playing for the Florida
Marlins' Triple A affiliate in Charlotte last year, he led the
International League with 35 bombs, 124 RBIs, 315 total bases, 84
extra-base hits, and a .634 slugging percentage.
</P>
<P>
   The lowly Marlins called him up for the proverbial cup of coffee
at the end of their 1998 train-wreck season. But he played
sparingly. The Marlins didn't think much of his defense (this past
Sunday, Daubach misplayed a wind-blown pop that landed near first
base for a single), and he went to the plate only 15 times, getting
three hits (his first big league hit was an RBI double off Curt
Schilling), none of them homers. After the season, he was released.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't shock me,'' he says. ``They had young guys they
wanted to protect.''
</P>
<P>
   He played winter ball for Red Sox first base coach Dave Jauss
and helped Licey win the Caribbean World Series. Daubach had a
chance to play in Japan, or sign a minor league contract to play
for the Yankees' Triple A club. Instead he opted to try out with
the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, it's working out pretty well. In his first nine spring
training games, Daubach hit .389 with one homer and six RBIs. The
homer was a two-run shot off the Blue Jays, a ninth-inning
game-winner. In light of injuries (Reggie Jefferson, Midre
Cummings, Jeff Frye), Daubach appears to be in the mix to make the
team as a lefthanded-hitting first baseman/outfielder/DH.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody who's still here has a chance to make the team,''
says ever-evasive manager Jimy Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Jauss adds, ``He can hit. And he can learn to hit more with Jim
Rice around and some of the veterans we've got here. You've got to
learn to hit when you're not a good defensive player and can't run.
But if he makes this club, it's because we've had some injuries and
he's earned it.''
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen years ago, the Sox had some luck with a spray hitter who
was labeled ``career minor leaguer.'' Wade Boggs got his break when
regular third baseman Carney Lansford broke his ankle. Boggs this
year is expected to crack his 3,000th hit.
</P>
<P>
   Daubach isn't going to quit if he doesn't make the team this
spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, everyone wants to play in the majors,'' he says.
``But I enjoy playing and competing. I've enjoyed every day of
this. I've got zero regrets. There's a lot of people like myself
who played eight or nine years in the minors. Whenever I'm done
playing, I'd like to be a coach.''
</P>
<P>
   He could coach young men how to hit. And how to be patient.

FROM SATIRIST TO SAD SACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gone (itals)and(unitals) forgotten _ that would be the legacy of
Al Capp, the comic strip artist and innovator whose broad humor and
bedrock misanthropy ruled the ``funny pages'' for over four
decades, from 1934 to 1977. He's as forgotten here in his adopted
hometown _ he wrote ``Li'l Abner'' from 122 Beacon St. in Boston,
on the edge of the Emerson College campus _ as elsewhere in
America, where his face once graced the cover of Time and Life
magazines, and his strip ran in 900 papers across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Newspaper readers of a certain age, who forgave Capp his human
and ideological divagations, call him the greatest American
political satirist of the 20th century. In 1952, John Steinbeck
(who, like Capp, would later be ostracized for backing the wrong,
i.e. American, side in the Vietnam War) wrote that ``Capp may very
possibly be the best writer in the world today,'' and recommended
him for a Nobel Prize.
</P>
<P>
   Capp was ``edgy,'' to use the modish term; irascible, difficult,
an enemy of cant. He made a fan in West Barnstable's own Alexander
Theroux, who has just published an admiring, 62-page monograph,
``The Enigma of Al Capp,'' available from Seattle's Fantagraphics
Books. This is probably as close to a biography as Capp will ever
come and serves as a useful reminder for today's graying hipsters
that the marvelously talented Garry Trudeau was anticipated by a
one-legged man who chain-smoked Benson &AMP; Hedges and considered
Richard Nixon one the great presidents of our time.
</P>
<P>
   One terrible event transformed Al Capp's life. At age 9, while
hitching a ride on an ice truck in New Haven, he fell off and had
his left leg severed by an oncoming trolley car. ``The nightmare of
my life,'' he said. For more than 60 years he hobbled through
marriage, fame, and eventual disgrace on a series of ungainly
prostheses. John Updike, a fan, wrote that Capp's accident cost him
``permanent banishment from the paradise of the normal.''
</P>
<P>
   Even a casual observer sees that Capp's art became obsessed with
legs, mainly women's legs, in their Betty Grable-esque rendition.
Updike: ``The ebullient, at times raunchy exaggeration of bodies
that is one of Dogpatch's striking features related, surely, to the
somatic awareness induced by Capp's missing limb and its painful,
awkward substitute.''
</P>
<P>
   The comic strip was indeed populated by hilarious grotesques:
the virginal, voluptuous Daisy Mae; Fearless Fosdick, the dead-on
Dick Tracy spoof; bulb-nosed Lonesome Polecat, the dispenser of
Kickapoo Joy Juice; the unlucky Joe Btfsplk, always drawn with an
accompanying rain cloud, and the buxom Moonbeam McSwine, who
prefered the company of hogs to men.
</P>
<P>
   Vilified at the end of his life as a man of the right, Capp made
his name as a man of the left. He saved his most vicious thrusts
for the potbellied exploiters of the Eisenhower era: the pompus,
reactionary Senator Jack S. Phogbound; the pork oligopolist J.
Roaringham Fatback; and the nemesis of all newspaper laborers,
Rockewell P. Squeezeblood, who ran a fictional cartoon syndicate.
``It's my belief that the comic strip Li'l Abner is one long fable
about greed,'' writes Theroux, who notes that Capp supported the
Adlai Stevenson and John Kennedy presidential campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   That all changed in the 1960s. Youth culture threw Capp a
curveball. He wittily lampooned the ubiquitous student
demonstrators as members of S.W.I.N.E. _ Students Wildly Indignant
about Nearly Everything, and tagged his Cambridge neighbor Joan
Baez with the monicker ``Joanie Phonie.'' He even suggested that
the Mafia might supplant the lily-livered Harvard administration
and clamp down on student protests, double-quick.
</P>
<P>
   But frequently, Capp missed the target. He trashed the Peace
Corps. He trashed welfare mothers. He trashed blacks. ``Let them
clean up their own ghettos,'' he wrote. ``I grew up in a Jewish
ghetto and loved it. . . . I know what it is to be imprisoned _ by
a wooden leg. . . . For chrissake, every man has his black skin,
every man has his wooden leg.''
</P>
<P>
   The end came quickly. His erratic behavior with young women led
to an adultery conviction in 1972. Hundreds of newspapers dropped
his strip. After Capp's disgrace, Updike met him, deflated, on a
near-empty shuttle flight to New York. Capp joked that if the plane
crashed, the newspaper headline would read ``ONLY EIGHT KILLED.''
Updike remembered the meeting in a poem, ``The Shuttle:''
</P>

   And the shuttle is always crowded.(unitals)

<P>
   WHITMAN, Mass. _ It's 7:30 on a Saturday morning, and the four
brightly colored booster seats at the kitchen table are already
filled by Andrew, Elise, Stephen, and Thomas McDonough. Leisurely
working their sippy cups, the four 2-year-olds are watching their
yawning father turn frozen waffles into breakfast. They are still
bleary-eyed and subdued, a condition that makes Joe McDonough a tad
uneasy. ``Are you all going to behave this morning?'' he asks,
warily glancing at the four upturned faces.
</P>
<P>
   If this were a summer's day, Joe and Kathy McDonough might load
their quadruplets into the family van _ (itals)every(unitals) quad
family owns a van _ and head for Nantasket Beach or Castle Island.
Things aren't so simple during the winter, however, what with four
hats, four coats, eight mittens and eight boots to wrestle the kids
into. Still, they're all going somewhere today, if only to Shaw's
or BJ's for groceries. ``They need to get out of here as much as we
do,'' Kathy McDonough says, nodding toward the table.
</P>
<P>
   But right now the kids are waking up in earnest. And so are
their parents. Another day of living with quads has begun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thomas, why aren't you eating?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Stephen, are you throwing food?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Elise, cover your mouth when you do that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Andrew, get that fork out of your ear. Andrew!'' There are
apparently no quintuplets in Massachusetts, but homes like the
McDonoughs' small and well-kept three-bedroom Cape, located on a
quarter of an acre of land on a dead-end street, are increasingly
common. The McDonough kids were one of 560 sets of quadruplets born
in the United States in 1996, a year when the number of
``higher-order multiple births'' (triplets and up) grew 19 percent
over the year before. Over the previous 10 years, such births had
already more than doubled, and there's no reason to think the
numbers aren't still growing. Call it the multiple baby boom.
</P>
<P>
   Reasons? More women are being treated for infertility with drugs
and techniques that increase the likelihood of multiple gestation.
More women are having children at an older age, which also
increases chances of multiple delivery. And more low birth weight
babies are surviving, thanks to improvements in intensive care.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts, one of only a handful of states that requires
that insurers pay for fertility services, is frequently at or near
the top of the multiple-birth pack. (It ranked fourth in all
multiple births in 1996, the last year for which figures are
available). But bringing four babies from the hospital still isn't
most folks' idea of parenthood. ``This wasn't supposed to happen to
us,'' says Kathy McDonough, who is 37. ``This is supposed to happen
to other people.''
</P>
<P>
   Imagine a day-care center where the kids never go home. Ever.
``People can try to tell you what this is like,'' Kathy McDonough
adds, ``but it's not until you live the life yourself that you can
really understand it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That first winter, 1996 to 1997, was the worst.
</P>
<P>
   For eight months, either Joe or Kathy had to be awake at all
times. It took three hours to feed the four babies, and then it was
time to begin again. Joe's brother, Jack McDonough, describes the
first months this way: ``Every 24 hours you have 32 diaper changes,
32 feedings, and 128 burps.''
</P>
<P>
   The quads all contracted a respiratory virus, and stomach flus
swept through the tiny house like a plague. So did ear infections.
``Don't tell me they're not contagious,'' Kathy says. ``The walls
were pink with amoxicillin because everyone was throwing up so
much.'' Kathy herself eventually spent six days in the hospital.
``I just never had a chance to go to the doctor.''
</P>
<P>
   Then as now, Joe worked late afternoons and evenings as a
customer service rep for Boston Gas. Then he was on duty at home
from midnight until 8 a.m., while Kathy slept, whereupon he'd go to
bed himself until it was time to go back to work at 3 p.m. Kathy
once missed two nights of sleep in a row and ``felt like I was
having a stroke.'' If one of the kids was picked up, the other
three immediately cried for similar attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very, very hard at first,'' says Joe, 36. ``Kathy and I
would get mad at each other, but we really weren't mad at each
other. It was the stress.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You never sat down,'' Kathy says. ``And you always had a baby
in your arms.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To tell you the truth,'' Joe adds, ``going to work was a
relief.''
</P>
<P>
   They certainly hadn't planned any of this, hadn't forseen that
their living room would one day feature a changing table, a diaper
disposal, four potty chairs, and piles of clean laundry waiting to
be put away. They'd been married for seven years by 1995 and
already had a 4-year-old daughter, Caroline. One or two additional
kids would be nice, they thought, but not more. Kathy had had
trouble conceiving Caroline, and when the fertility drugs she was
using _ primarily the ovulatory stimulants Clomid and Metrodin _
failed to do the job after nearly two years, she and Joe were ready
to give up and remain a family of three.
</P>
<P>
   But, lo, the drugs finally worked. And when Kathy went for an
ultrasound test at South Shore Medical Center, knowing she was
carrying two mature eggs, she thought she might even be having
twins. When she saw the technician stiffen during the test,
however, she knew something more unusual was happening.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many?'' asked Joe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you ready to hear?'' asked the technician.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I wasn't ready to hear four,'' Kathy recalls. ``I laugh
when I get nervous, and I was laughing my head off. They looked
like four tiny caterpillars.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe and Kathy then went through a round of advice from doctors
who told them the dangers of higher-order multiple births, of the
significantly higher mortality rates and the increased chances of
birth defects. Selective reduction _ reducing the number of fetuses
_ was strongly suggested. But Joe and Kathy adamantly refused.
(Both are Roman Catholic, but say they were influenced more by
making a decision about which fetuses would survive and which
wouldn't.) The quads were born about eight weeks prematurely on
April 26, 1996, via caesarean section, at Massachusetts General
Hospital. They all weighed between 3 and 4 pounds. They have had no
serious health problems, although they are facing minor auditory
processing and motor planning issues, not uncommon among preemies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really believe this has happened for a reason,'' Kathy says.
``The thing is, I just can't figure out what that reason is right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew (the ringleader), Stephen (the sly one), and Thomas (the
shy one) all sleep in a tiny second-floor bedroom, their cribs in a
row. Elise (the mother hen) shares a room with Caroline, who's now
7. The rooms are too small for much more than sleep, so there's a
downstairs playroom known as ``The Pen.'' It's a small area to
patrol, although not when eight legs are involved, and not when
eight eager hands might open a window to fetch some snow or cover
their bodies with Baby Magic. ``You think you're watching them, and
suddenly they prove to you that you're not,'' says Joe. ``If you
hear all of them laughing together, you know you're in trouble.''

<P>
   Joe and Kathy's darkest fear is that one of them will be home
alone with the quads and run short of, say, milk (usage: nearly 6
gallons per week) or diapers (about 100 each week). Even a short
trip to the local convenience store is a major organizational feat.
And, like the parents of other quadruplets, Kathy and Joe have
learned that you must split up when you go to a shopping mall,
because if you travel with quads so many people rush up to you with
questions and comments that a 45-minute stop can become a
three-hour layover.
</P>
<P>
   Even when you do get away, you don't really get away. People at
work ask you about The Quads. Friends stop you on the street to ask
about The Quads. Family members call to inquire after The Quads.
(The first photo of the quartet was in such demand that it required
70 copies.) ``Our 15 minutes of fame are our kids,'' muses Joe.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, on their ninth wedding anniversary, Joe asked Kathy:
``You want to go out to BJ's or Shaw's?'' Actually, they went
bowling.
</P>
<P>
   Having a child obviously changes a parent's life, but having
four children at once alters it completely. It's a matter of saying
everything four times or hiring teenage babysitters in pairs. It's
a matter of pretty much giving up golf because you no longer have
any free time, of foregoing restaurants because they're such a
hassle, or of not even thinking about taking a family vacation
anymore. Sometimes Kathy gets together with other multiple-birth
mothers, a select group of women who've found each other primarily
through a local support group called Triplets, Moms, and More
(www.tripletsmomsandmore.org). ``But I notice we don't really get
invited anywhere anymore,'' she says, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The change also hasn't been easy for Caroline. Her wished-for
trip to Disney World has been permanently placed on hold. Her
college fund has become an emergency fund and was used last
Christmas to pay for presents. And although she clearly cares for
her four sudden siblings, she sometimes resents the attention they
get. ``Babies, babies, babies!'' she once blurted. ``I'm so sick
and tired of babies!'' Another time she told her mother, ``I don't
want God to put any more babies in your tummy.''
</P>
<P>
   The McDonoughs' income is modest. (Kathy works part-time in the
collections division of the Internal Revenue Service.) The family
can get by, but there's no nest egg stashed away. Not anymore. The
quads will soon need beds, which means their parents will likely
need a loan. And college? ``I'm going to give them tennis rackets
and golf clubs and tell them to practice,'' Kathy declares.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that the parents of quads will tell you is that they
couldn't do it by themselves and that, luckily, they often don't
have to. There is something about higher-order multiple births that
brings out volunteers and even small cash donors, folks who are
eager to help. ``We got money from people we barely knew,'' marvels
Joe. People sent hand-knit sweaters, cases of diapers, even cribs.
``At one point we had more swings than babies,'' Kathy reports.
Even baby-care companies chipped in, sending the likes of Pampers,
Huggies, and _ yes _ Baby Magic.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Relatives and friends also showed up at the door, often working
regular shifts. ``My father, who has four kids and had never fed a
baby in his life, fed these kids,'' Kathy says. Helpers would
occasionally stay until midnight and come back at dawn the next
day. ``Everyone wants to help so much because they're so amazed by
quads,'' Kathy says.
</P>
<P>
   Such help still turns up _ two or three women regularly come on
Thursday nights so that Kathy can go out, for example _ but not as
often. Maybe the amazement has worn off, or maybe there's just a
sense that the McDonoughs are coping. After all, this winter has
brought only a single ear infection and just two rounds of stomach
flu.
</P>
<P>
   On most nights, Joe is working and it's up to Kathy to put the
quads to bed. Lately this has become like herding cattle: she must
track down reluctant strays, point them in the right direction, and
hope she hasn't lost any of the others in the meantime. ``Don't
want to go to bed!'' Andrew announces one recent evening at 8:15,
which clearly reflects the majority point of view.
</P>
<P>
   During the next hour or so, Kathy asks, begs, pleads, and
demands. The three boys, in particular, would clearly rather be
somewhere other than in their cribs. Andrew climbs out and is
discovered lying atop his parents' bed. A few minutes later, he
crawls under Thomas's crib. So Stephen gets out of
(itals)his(unitals) crib to report this news to his mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't want to go to bed!''
</P>
<P>
   At 9:05, the telephone rings. It's Joe, calling from work. But
someone's on the upstairs phone. ``Andrew! Andrew! Hang up the
phone!'' Kathy says into the mouthpiece. ``Stephen? Is that you,
Stephen?''
</P>
<P>
   By 9:15, the sound of silence finally fills the small house.
Kathy stands in the kitchen, hoping it will last. ``Somebody told
me I should keep a journal,'' she says softly. ``Well, by the time
I get them settled down for the night, I'm not about to sit down
and write a book.''
</P>
<P>
   In 10 hours or so, the four 2-year-olds will wander one by one
into the kitchen once again, groggy and in search of breakfast.
Another day will begin, the kind very few parents can possibly
understand. Or maybe they can. Says Kathy McDonough: ``I have
friends who say to me, `When I'm having a bad day, I think of you.'

<HEADLINE>
A HIGH PRICE FOR OUR LOW CRIME RATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Paul Guidel, who was 17 when he committed second-degree murder,
lived in a Fishkill, N.Y., prison cell for 68 years, eight months,
and two days before being released at age 85. He holds the record
for the man imprisoned longest in the United States. He made the
Guinness Book of Records. You can look it up.
</P>
<P>
   But he has lots of company. The numbers are out again, and the
totals are eye-popping: At the rate we're going, we'll have just
under 2 million Americans behind bars by the end of 1999. Happy New
Year. As of last June, the government counted 1.8 million, an
all-time high. And that's not counting the hundreds of thousands of
Americans paid to guard, feed, house, inoculate, and otherwise fuss
over them. Only Russia imprisons citizens at a higher rate, among
the, ahem, (itals)advanced(unitals) countries.
</P>
<P>
   We had just under 1.7 million men in prisons and jails run by
federal, state, county, and city authorities last June, out of a
total of 128 million American males. That means one out of every 76
men is behind bars as we speak, and the number grows daily. At this
rate, we're going to run out of men, when you consider the inmate
population is six times what it was in the early '70s during
Richard Nixon's first term. We cannot sustain these rates.
</P>
<P>
   There are as many blacks as whites in prison, but a black male
is six times more likely to be sent away as a white male. As many
as one out of every four black men between 20 and 30 has had some
encounter with the criminal justice system. Only one out of 16
prisoners is female. The New York Times quotes experts saying the
prison population explosion is caused by several factors, including
longer sentences and a surge in drug-related arrests.
</P>
<P>
   In five states, more than one black man out of 10 is
disenfranchised _ barred from ever voting because of a criminal
conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Look at it another way: As things stand today, it is as if the
total population of Maine and Vermont was behind bars _ and we had
to hire everyone in Wyoming to guard them. Ludicrous? Of course.
But that's our policy. See any change coming? Not in the near term.
Politicians love to point to lowered crime rates _ crime rates have
dropped for the last seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Longer sentences and harsher penalties sound great on the
evening news. People like to hear that, among them fearful voters,
eager-to-please-pols, those making money off the billions we spend
for new $100,000-a-pop prison cells, where it costs 30 grand a year
to keep some wretch locked up.
</P>
<P>
   Academic studies have shown a direct correlation between voters'
fear of crime and media hype, tabloid outrages exploited by news
reports, with television the leading offender. ``If it bleeds it
leads'' is cynical TV shorthand for the allure of bloody tales to
jack the ratings up. Our print brethren gasp trying to catch up in
the titillation department.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate result is harsher treatment of criminals, typically
young, poor, nonwhite, ill-educated, socially backward, and, let us
be frank, sometimes dumb as a mackerel. Yes, there are many, many
prisoners who are vicious, violent, and deservedly tucked away. But
there are also hundreds of thousands of prisoners who are
nonviolent, who could be handled outside the costly and ineffective
prison apparatus, who could benefit from learning to read, compute,
talk straight and walk straight, stand straight and live straight.
</P>
<P>
   House arrest, ankle bracelets, more parole and probation
officers, drug treatment where it is needed, when it is needed, and
alcohol and spousal abuse programs would be much more sensible,
effective, and economical. No, not every poor boy is a good boy.
Yes, there are some people too dangerous to release.
</P>
<P>
   But the way we're going is the wrong way. It's the easy way, but
it's not the cheap way. It's the dumb way. But rare is the
politician who'll buck the mob on this score. The votes of a
handful of inmate wives, inmate girlfriends, inmate relatives are
drowned out by the cacophony that erupts after every notorious
crime, every grisly episode recounted breathlessly by some TV
reporter doing a formulaic standup outside the cop shop.
</P>
<P>
   Passion is what sells on TV. That's why you hear far more often
from the angry cop, the aggrieved victim's family, the posturing
politician, than you hear from the more thoughtful, less
impassioned folk who have managed to overcome their fears and argue
reasonably for humane treatment of inmates.
</P>
<P>
   Prison can be a cruel environment, particularly for the young
and vulnerable. Vicious things happen behind bars. Stacking all
these wayward teenagers in with older, hardened, rotting souls is
like storing the gas can next to the oil burner. You have only
yourself to blame when it blows.
</P>
<P>
   Here's another troubling trend: The Sun Belt states are way out
of line with prison sentencing. Louisiana and Texas incarcerate 700
of every 100,000 citizens. Maine locks up criminals at about
one-sixth that rate, Vermont at one-fourth. How come? Are they more
law-abiding up north? Or are those frugal Yankees wiser when it
comes to squandering human potential?

RADIO SERIES FINDS IDEALISM IN ORDINARY PEOPLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fed up with Monica? Weary of murder, fire, hurricanes, and
endless other tragedies?
</P>
<P>
   Then an ambitious 13-part series produced for public radio about
ordinary people struggling to live their spiritual values might
come as a welcome antidote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Humankind'', which was produced at a small studio in Belmont,
profiles people from different walks of life striving in daily ways
to make a difference.
</P>
<P>
   In a time of widespread cynicism, ``Humankind,'' the brainchild
of award-winning documentary producer David Freudberg, celebrates
old-fashioned values _ integrity, compassion, equality, and
generosity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I strongly believe people are looking for a clear articulation
of ideals and values,'' said Freudberg, 43, who has worked in
public radio since he was a teenager in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a very dangerous thing for our society to have
the degree of cynicism that I see as being almost pervasive,'' said
Freudberg. ``It's corrosive, and I have been thirsting for some way
in which the media can responsibly provide another road.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Humankind'' includes the voices of a man who drives a truck
delivering food to homeless shelters; a former reporter who started
a summer camp in Maine for Israeli and Arab children; and an
elderly woman who each week rides two buses and a subway to pick up
food at a food pantry for her friend who can't get around easily.
</P>
<P>
   Driving a delivery truck for a food charity is ``a blessing,''
Herman Manigo told Freudberg in one episode, ``because I've been
where a lot of these people are now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, you can survive being broke, but it's very difficult
when you don't have food on the table for your kids, because they
don't understand that. Now I have a chance to give back and I
wouldn't trade it in for nothing in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Other ``Humankind'' episodes highlight a hospice in North
Carolina where patients receive free care; the effects on personal
discipline of fasting, and personal questions about how individuals
choose to donate to charity.
</P>
<P>
   The people Freudberg profiles aren't saints. They are simply
ordinary people motivated by a sense of decency that Freudberg says
he found moving and inspiring.
</P>
<P>
   Listen to Jerry Smith, a counselor at Seeds of Peace, the summer
camp in Otisfield, Maine, for Israeli and Palestinian youth, talk
about what happens when youngsters who are supposed to hate each
other have a chance to play and talk with each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can spend your whole life hating your enemy, but that one
moment that you take to love your enemy and find a way to get past
that hate really helps you move forward in your own life,'' said
Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Crisscrossing the country, speaking to dozens of people,
Freudberg said he found several overarching themes among many
Americans today.
</P>
<P>
   One is a longing for a sense of community. A second is a desire
to carve out ``quiet time'' to escape our frenetic lives. A third
is a concern not only with what we do in our work lives, but how we
do it.
</P>
<P>
   A fourth theme Freudberg heard repeatedly is that you get ``back
so much more from giving than from receiving.'' And, finally, the
possibility that people in trouble can transform their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Freudberg met a Vietnam War veteran tortured by memories of some
of the things he was ordered to do during the war, who was able to
exorcise his demons and overcome a drug addiction by joining a
veteran's organization that builds health clinics in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me ideals are the direction that my compass points to,''
Freudberg said. ``It's not necessarily that I'm going to get there,
but it's the direction I need to head in order to progress.''

<P>
   Shining the spotlight on an important interreligious issue,
Boston College, a Jesuit institution, has launched the Center for
the Study of the Jewish and Christian Relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Pope John Paul II has made improving Catholic-Jewish relations a
top priority.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, Catholic and Jewish leaders have forged strong ties
that have resulted in several initiatives _ including how Judaism
is taught in Catholic religion classes _ to increase mutual
understanding and tolerance.
</P>
<P>
   Boston College, given its extensive theological resources,
seemed the ``best local place'' to set up such a center, said Ruth
Langner, assistant professor of Jewish studies at the school.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning this fall, the center will offer two courses every
semester dealing with Catholic-Jewish issues.
</P>
<P>
   It kicks off a public lecture series Monday at 7:30 p.m. at
Boston College with a talk by Professor Philip A. Cunningham of
Notre Dame College in Manchester N.H., who will speak on ``Telling
the Christian Story in a Post-Supersessionist Church.'' For

   Book Notes: What makes one church thrive while another has empty
pews? This is one of the questions the Rev. Stephen A. Macchia,
president of Vision New England, an evangelical Christian
association, addresses in his new book, ``Becoming A Healthy
Church.''
</P>
<P>
   In his new book, the Rev. Michael Smith Foster, associate
judicial vicar for the Archdiocese of Boston, discusses one of the
most controversial and, perhaps, least well understood topics in
the Roman Catholic Church _ the annulment process. Foster's book is
entitled ``Annulment: The Wedding that Was.''

C-SPAN MARKS ITS 20TH ANNIVERSARY 
</HEADLINE>
   TV Notes  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TIM GOODMAN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ History is being made on Friday: the 20th
anniversary of C-SPAN.
</P>
<P>
   You can use trusty old C-SPAN as the butt-end of a bad joke. But
not here. We know C-SPAN for what it truly is _ the country's most
underappreciated network.
</P>
<P>
   The handful of people who watch MSNBC can talk all they want
about news coverage. The people at Fox News can spin the media _
their own company excluded, of course _ as politically biased.
</P>
<P>
   But there's only one truly unfettered source for finding out
exactly how the political machine works in this country and it's
C-SPAN.
</P>
<P>
   If we weren't such a bored culture, thirsting for MTV quick cuts
and Sam Donaldson's squint as he gets all pedantic ``analyzing''
the news, then we'd watch C-SPAN and soak up American political
history as it happens.
</P>
<P>
   So many people were stunned to find out exactly how inept,
insipid and biased the Congress really was amid all the coverage of
President Clinton's sex scandal, but veteran C-SPANers were
nonplused. They'd seen how low we could go a long time ago.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was revealed on ``Good Morning America'' that Muhammad Ali's
21-year-old-daughter, Laila Ali (in her first TV interview), is a
boxer. Did everyone else sleep through this? Missed it and regret
it. Did she work Charlie Gibson like a heavy bag? Is there a
21-year-old Georgette Foreman out there? Will there be a
pay-per-view event?
</P>
<P>
   Let this be a lesson: Sleep through the morning shows and you
know nothing, friend. Nothing.
</P>
<P>
   And where was Oprah during this revelation?
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Daytime smut peddlers like Jerry Springer have been written
about and derided so much that now everyone has given up, as the
horse is now apparently dead and well beaten.
</P>
<P>
   But we're not done. We're inspired by Laila, baby. We're
throwing roundhouses, angry as Mike Tyson off his lithium or
whatever. We're not going to let Ricki Lake _ smut peddler
extraordinaire _ get away with these real-life topics: ``Girl, It's
Gonna Get Heated ... I've Got Proof Your Man Cheated''; ``You
Treated Me Badly ... Today You Pay!'; ``Wake Up, Girl! He's Told
You He's Gay ... Why Do You Stay?''; ``You Made a Mess ... Today I
Force You to Confess Your Secret!''
</P>
<P>
   And, finally: ``Fasten Your Seatbelts ... Today We'll Replay the
Best Battles From the Past.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's only a week's worth. Maybe Ricki Lake is at peace
with herself about getting rich off the backs of ignorant America,
but we're hoping there's some serious Instant Karma coming up.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The people at Imagine Television _ the powerful producing group
formed by Ron Howard and Brian Grazer _ wants to create an
African-American competitor to Barbara Walters' ``The View.'' They
are calling it ``Girlfriends'' and have Robin Givens and Kym
Whitley lined up. They are looking for a younger black female to
get the twentysomething crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be territorial here, but isn't there really a show like
this already, except it has only one ``Girlfriend. '' That's right
_ ``Oprah.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't wake the sleeping giant.

NCAA'S HALL OF SHAME

<TEXT>
<P>
   So you've gotten the men to stop throwing beer bottles and salsa
at you after you blocked the TV during a last-second, game winning
shot to engage them in thoughtful dialogue about why idiot men's
college basketball programs are glorified while smart female
players are ghettoized on ESPN2.
</P>
<P>
   Nervous? I feel your tremors. Last week, a friend took me to the
National Collegiate Athletic Association men's tournament at the
Fleet Center. He also invited me to a pregame pub party.
</P>
<P>
   When I arrived at the pub, the host said, ``We heard you were
coming. Your column this morning was required reading for this
party.'' I immdiately felt like marinated lamb chops. Despite the
din, I could hear my heart pounding oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh. I saw beer
glasses everywhere and reflexively began ducking.
</P>
<P>
   Then the host said, ``We liked it.'' It was my lucky day. The
host and some of the other men were racism and sexism diversity
trainers. We went into the Fleet Center to root for Lafayette,
which has a 100 percent graduation rate.
</P>
<P>
   You are not so lucky. Diversity for the men in front of you is
Bud and Bud Lite. The next game is about to start. Room rage is
rising again. Arms are cocked with more bottles and Tostitos.
</P>
<P>
   You need a trump card. Slap this scorecard on the coffee table.
You don't need to say ``Read it and weep!'' or ``Analyze this!''
Throw it down. Stand back. Watch testosterone cry.

   --Category: The Titanic. Where graduation rates sink to the
depths of Leonardo DiCaprio's body. This is for a graduation rate
of 30 percent or less. Final Score: Men 21 teams, Women 0.

   --Category: Sinsinnati, UCon, and the Temple of Doom. These are
the schools that shamelessly profit from black athletes with no
expectation they will graduate. This is for schools that graduate
less than 40 percent of African-American players.
</P>
<P>
   The Final Score: Men 33 teams, Women 7. The 33 men's teams, over
half the entire field, had an average black graduation rate of 17
percent. How can Jesse Jackson or the NAACP stand for this?
</P>
<P>
   The plantations, with notations of teams under 20 percent, were:

</P>
<P>
   --Category: The Weaker Sex. Of the 19 schools with teams in both
the men's and women's tournaments, the women's team outgraduated
the men's team by a score of 15 to 4.
</P>
<P>
   The men's victories were: Stanford, 100-77; Duke, 83-79; North
Carolina, 77-73, and Florida, 69-60. The women's victories were:

<P>
   --Category: New England: The gradation average for the six New
England women's teams (Boston College, Maine, Northeastern, Holy
Cross, UConn, and Dartmouth) vs. the average for the two New
England men's teams (Connecticut and Rhode Island). The Final
Score. Women 72, Men 33.
</P>
<P>
   And men are whining about Title IX? Please. If these were real
scores, the men would be ridiculed. Coaches and athletic directors
would be fired. The men's tournament would be declared as corrupt
as the Salt Lake Olympics and the Holyfield fight.
</P>
<P>
   So this scorecard is for you, for the quixotic mission of
goading the primordal asylum to stop cheering and start jeering the
Sinsinnatis, the UCons, and the Temples of Doom during March
Madness. Tell them if they don't watch out, a federal judge just
may banish the men to ESPN2. That would really make testosterone
cry.

<HEADLINE>
EVEN IF LYCOS DEAL FAILS, DILLER COULD BENEFIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Barry Diller has lost out on big deals before. The New York
media baron who helped create the Fox Television Network in the
1980s is also known for his unsuccessful attempt to take control of
the Paramount movie studio five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But in his latest effort _ a bid to assume control of Internet
portal Lycos Inc., Diller seems to have learned something about
self-protection.
</P>
<P>
   The terms of his controversial bid for Lycos Inc. give Diller's
USA Networks Inc. the option to buy 17.5 percent of the company,
even if a rival suitor emerges. That could prove valuable to Diller
if Lycos's biggest shareholder, venture capital firm CMGI Inc.,
succeeds in arranging a counterbid, as its chief executive has
pledged to do. By the same token, an ongoing role for Diller in
Lycos might discourage another buyer from joining a counteroffer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big obstacle,'' said one person familiar with CMGI's
attempts to arrange a challenge to Diller's bid.
</P>
<P>
   David Wetherell, CMGI chief executive, says he has talked with
at least four parties who may be interested in topping the offer
USA Networks made for Lycos on Feb. 9. Under that pact, Lycos would
merge with elements of USA Networks like its Home Shopping Network
and the Ticketmaster service.
</P>
<P>
   Before the deal was announced, Lycos's shares had traded as high
as $137 apiece on expectations that the company, as the last big
independent portal, could attract a rich offer.
</P>
<P>
   But the deal disappointed investors, even though many stock
analysts have come to endorse it. After Lycos shares sank as low as
83 7/8, Wetherell stepped down from the Lycos board of directors
and began campaigning publicly against the agreement. As reported,
Wetherell believes he has enough support from other major
shareholders to block the proposed deal.
</P>
<P>
   Diller has said he won't renegotiate the terms of the Lycos
agreement now, but a spokeswoman for USA Networks said Tuesday if a
higher bid emerges, USA Networks would consider making an even
higher offer.
</P>
<P>
   But even if Diller does nothing, a clause in a USA Networks
filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission on Feb. 26
suggests Diller would be protected if a competing bidder emerges.
The clause allows Diller's USA Networks to purchase up to 7.56
million shares of Lycos, or 17.5 percent of the company, at $127.14
apiece, near the stock's closing price the day before the deal was
announced. Other rights assigned to Diller-controlled Ticketmaster
Online-CitySearch Inc. could bring the total stake in Lycos to 19.9
percent, the filing states.
</P>
<P>
   Exercising the options would require USA Networks to come up
with as much as $961 million in cash. Still, even individuals close
to Lycos concede the options would prove profitable to Diller if a
rival bid valued Lycos at more than $127 per share _ roughly the
price at which the USA deal originally valued Lycos.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Birnbaum, a partner at the Foley, Hoag and Eliot law firm
who specializes in mergers &AMP; acquisitions, said that ordinarily, a
would-be buyer would regard a challenge like Wetherell's as
``exactly what you don't want to happen'' after a merger agreement
is reached. But under Diller's arrangments, he said, that may not
be the case.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the price of Lycos, based in Waltham, Mass., dropped
1/4 to 105 1/2.

HOME SHOPPING FIRMS DON'T GET RESPECT, JUST REVENUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cubic zirconia merchants are starting to earn some respect.
</P>
<P>
   Companies like Home Shopping Network Inc. and QVC are best known
for the kitschy rhinestones they advertise on cable television. But
savvy marketers and investors now see their vast customer databases
as potential gems in the burgeoning world of electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Home Shopping Network alone has more than 20 million customer
names and credit card numbers on file _ more than three times as
many as giant on-line bookseller Amazon.com is estimated to keep.
</P>
<P>
   That reach, combined with Home Shopping's ability to fill tens
of thousands of orders a day, is a key reason some analysts back a
controversial merger proposal under which Home Shopping's parent,
USA Networks Inc., would take control of Lycos Inc., the
Waltham-based Internet portal.
</P>
<P>
   Another home-shopping channel, Minneapolis-based ValueVision
International Inc., recently received a $56 million investment from
General Electric Co. and its NBC broadcasting unit to develop
content allied with NBC's other on-line interests like CNet and its
Snap.com service.
</P>
<P>
   Forward-looking Internet investors often scoff at the business
models of the home-shopping channels. In their view, the revenue
and profits these companies generate can't support the huge market
valuations investors place on companies that describe themselves as
pure Internet plays and benefit from the potential of the new
on-line mediums.
</P>
<P>
   But the recent interest from NBC and Lycos suggests that at its
heart, electronic commerce won't be much different from the
business model pioneered by companies best known for hawking
costume jewelry: draw the attention of far-flung buyers with flashy
programs, then ship them goods quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody with expertise in fulfilling customer orders should be
feared in the on-line world,'' said Ken Cassar, an analyst with
Jupiter Communications. Said Chris Charron of Forrester Research,
``The portals as a whole realize the importance of e-commerce, and
they're looking for players who already know the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Uncertainty over the future of Lycos illustrates just how
complex it has become to value home-shopping services. Officially,
the chief executive of Lycos' largest investor, CMGI Inc., withdrew
his support for the pending merger last week because he felt the
agreement with USA Networks didn't assign enough value to Lycos
shares. Instead, CMGI chief David Wetherell said he would try to
assemble a higher bid for control of Lycos.
</P>
<P>
   But even Wetherell agrees that USA Networks and its Home
Shopping Nework unit have something to offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody on the (CMGI) board saw the potential value of the
pieces that were coming together,'' Wetherell told investors on a
conference call last Thursday. He added that he has received
hundreds of e-mails from other investors opposed to the terms of
the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of a sweeter bid boosted Lycos shares 14 percent
last Wednesday, but they have dropped back slightly since then.
Tuesday, they closed at 105 1/2, down 1/4. CMGI shares, which hit a
high of 199 11/16 on March 8, fell 11 7/8 Tuesday to 180 3/4.
</P>
<P>
   Interest in home-shopping channels stems from the revenue they
generate. The two largest are QVC, jointly owned by cable
television companies ComCast Corp. and Tele-Communications Inc.,
followed by Home Shopping Network Inc. Together they are estimated
to have sold about $3 billion worth of goods in 1998. In contrast,
the largest seller of consumer goods over the Internet, Amazon.com,
had revenue of about $650 million in its most recent fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, home-shopping services already had begun to establish
themselves on the World Wide Web, even before the recent flurry of
interest. The third-ranked home-shopping channel, Shop At Home
Inc., recently struck a deal with Oracle Corp. to create a Web site
featuring collectibles and baseball cards.
</P>
<P>
   In Minneapolis, ValueVision executives say the company recorded
several million dollars worth of sales through its Web site during
the 12 months ended Jan. 31, up from ``a couple hundred thousand''
for the same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   When the company first set up its Web site in 1997, its goal was
limited to attracting consumers who saw ValueVision's infomercials
on cable television, said Steve Sedahl, the company's manager of
electronic commerce. But now live video feeds over the company's
Web site means consumers with advanced PCs and modems can watch the
shopping show on line through a video link over the Internet.
Inadvertently, that also helped attract interest from NBC, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Lycos vice president Thomas E. Guilfoile cited Home
Shopping Networks' ability to process as many as 30,000 customer
orders in 24 hours as a powerful draw. The network once moved $24
million worth of computers in a single day, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Now Lycos must convince a majority of its investors that the
potential benefits of an alliance with USA Networks will, in the
not-so-long run, benefit shareholders more than any deal Wetherell
might cobble together.
</P>
<P>
   Wetherell said he has as long as four months to arrange a deal
before Lycos holds a shareholder meeting to vote on its merger
agreements. He is currently vacationing in the Caribbean,
indicating a competing proposal might not be imminent.
</P>
<P>
   But industry observers think time might be on Lycos's side if
Wetherell can't find another interested buyer quickly. One ironic
possibility is NBC, which previously passed on a deal for Lycos but
now could combine the search engine with the its newly acquired
interest in ValueVision.

FATHER-DAUGHTER BOND IS TOTENBERG'S BIGGEST REWARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA MATCHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWTON, Mass. _ Nina Totenberg, legal affairs correspondent for
National Public Radio, likes to tell the story about the time her
sister, Jill, was writing a college entrance essay. It began, ``My
father was an immigrant,'' Nina recalls. ``To which he responded,
she says, affecting her thickest Polish accent, ``I vas
(itals)not(unitals) an immigrant. I vas an invited guest of the
United States government!''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking by phone from her office in Washington, D.C., Nina
laughs when she tells the story, which she considers quintessential
Roman Totenberg.
</P>
<P>
   When he tells his version of the story at home in Newton, Roman
Totenberg, 87, chuckles, amused at an image of himself as a peasant
among the huddled masses. ``She made me sound like someone just off
the boat!'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Technically speaking, the Polish-born Totenberg _ a renowned
violinist and teacher _ (itals)was)(unitals) an immigrant when he
came to the United States in 1938 (even though, yes, three years
earlier he'd been an invited guest on a monthlong US concert tour.)
</P>
<P>
   It is in this context that on Friday he will be among eight
immigrants honored in Washington at the Fourth Annual Immigrant
Achievement Awards, sponsored by the American Immigration Law
Foundation. The awards are given to American immigrants who have
distinguished themselves by ``making a difference in communities
around the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Totenberg, who many years later still rolls his r's and
pronounces his w's as v's, easily satisfies the requirement. His
musical career, which began when he tutored his first violin
student at the age of 11 (the student was 10), continues to be
prodigious. He has been an important figure on the international
concert circuit; has made hundreds of recordings; and has been a
dedicated teacher known for his exacting and generous spirit. A
star pupil as a young man of the legendary Carl Flesch in Berlin,
Totenberg has been hailed as one of the last remaining links to
pre-World War II violin playing, which has since been dominated by
Russian teaching and style.
</P>
<P>
   He still gives concerts, though ``not very much,'' he says
dismissively. ``Only about 10 a year. I used to play 60 or 70.''
But his parallel career of teaching continues to flourish.
Totenberg still works full-time at Boston University's School for
the Arts where he has taught for 38 years and where he cochairs the
string department. Three years ago he won the University's top
teaching honor, the Metcalf prize for excellence.
</P>
<P>
   But this week's award is especially sweet for Totenberg because
the event will be hosted by his beloved daughter, Nina, a respected
NPR reporter who broke the Clarence Thomas/Anita Hill story. At 55,
she is the eldest of his three daughters: Jill, 51, is a business
executive in New York, and Amy, 48, is a prominent Atlanta
attorney.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each one of the girls, in their fields, is remarkable,'' says
Roman Totenberg, launching a sort of preemptive strike lest a
visitor inquire only about Nina. ``Jill is an executive, so to say.
She tells them how to run the company. Amy has won many important
cases, all by herself.''
</P>
<P>
   It is clear immediately that his love for music is matched, no,
surpassed, by his adoration of the three grown girls whose
photographs are displayed throughout his spacious home, along with
mementos of his career _ the signed photograph of Franklin D.
Roosevelt, the photo of himself with pianist Artur Rubinstein, the
framed note from physician and musician Albert Schweitzer.
</P>
<P>
   But it is Nina with whom he has the most poignant bond. Both
father and daughter recently lost their spouses. Melanie Totenberg,
Roman's wife of 57 years, died 2 1/2 years ago. Last August, Nina
lost her husband, former Colorado Senator Floyd Haskell. When
Haskell died at 82 of pneumonia, it was her father to whom Nina
reached out. Haskell died on an airplane while he and Nina were
returning from a vacation in Maine; the pilot then returned the
plane to Bangor, and Nina says one of her first thoughts was to ask
the control tower to call her father to meet her at the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Roman Totenberg was in Maine, though more than an hour away from
Bangor. Nina says he drove ``85 miles an hour'' and stopped only
when he got to the tarmac so he could meet her. ``He was very
tender and sweet,'' she recalls. ``We went to a Catholic Hospital,
and later one of the nuns said to me that he had been standing in
the waiting room while I was with Floyd, and saying, ``That's my
daughter and there is nothing I can to do help her.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Nina, ``He is an incredibly perceptive, sweet human being.
He played at Floyd's funeral. I can't tell you how wonderful he has
been to me. He has a very light touch, just when I need him the
most.''
</P>
<P>
   The continued vitality of her father _ a man she says is a
unique combination of ``hypochondriac and stoic'' _ continues to
astound her. ``He cleans my clock in tennis; I can't get a point
off him most of the time,'' she says. ``Once, when he jumped and
put a shot away on me, I said to him, `Don't you understand you're
supposed to be old?' ''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Totenberg calls Nina his ``grown-up little girl. .
. . There are many occasions when a parent is the last resort to a
child. When something is wrong, each daughter calls and says,
``Daddy, fix it!''
</P>
<P>
   And can he fix it? ``I think I can,'' he says, beaming.
</P>
<P>
   The telephone rings. Totenberg, dressed this Saturday morning in
a dapper burgundy jacket, colorful tie, and pocket handkerchief,
hurries over to answer it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hello darling,'' he says happily. It is Nina, checking in as
she and her sisters do almost every day. ``Daddy, I wanted to say I
was sorry about Yehudi Menuhin (the violinist who died last
week),'' Nina says. ``Didn't you see him last spring? I knew he
wasn't well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I was upset,'' Totenberg says, walking back and forth in
his sunny study while speaking on a cordless telephone. ``He was in
the best of moods when I saw him. He was terribly friendly with his
students. He was with his daughter Mira.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember Mira _ we went swimming (as children) in their
swimming pool in California,'' his daughter replies. ``I remember
that it had a slanted bottom.''
</P>
<P>
   ``(itals)She(unitals) did not have a slanted bottom,'' Totenberg
quips.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pool did,'' Nina groans, in mock exasperation. The
conversation turns to Nina's plans for the day (marketing, buying a
new CD player), and to the temper tantrum that Jill's newly adopted
daughter was having when Nina called the other day. The little girl
is named Melanie, for her late grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was nice to talk to you,'' Totenberg signs off.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, darling daddy,'' Nina says.
</P>
<P>
   Both of them are looking forward to May, when they will take a
vacation to Europe together. But first there is Totenberg's sojourn
to Washington this weekend, to receive his award.
</P>
<P>
   Nina has lined up ``a busy social schedule'' for the two of
them. There is the Friday night awards dinner, then on Saturday,
lunch with Attorney General Janet Reno (``he is mad about her and
she is mad about him''), and dinner with friends. Sunday and Monday
will be consumed with other lunch, dinner, and party engagements.
</P>
<P>
   Then, newly invigorated, he will head back to Boston. Roman
Totenberg must return to work, after all.

A LITTLE-KNOWN WONDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Given the success of Holy Cross, Northeastern, and
Boston College this year in women's basketball, it's easy to forget
about Salem State.
</P>
<P>
   Easy, but not fair.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Holy Cross making its seventh trip in 14 years to the NCAA
Tournament is impressive. The surprise NCAA debut of Northeastern
was a great story; the breakthrough year at The Heights was a joy.
And of course, perennial powerhouse Bentley is at it again, back in
the Division 2 Elite Eight.
</P>
<P>
   But when Salem State meets the College of St. Benedict (Minn.)
in Friday's semifinals in Danbury, Conn., the Lady Vikings will
make their fourth appearance in the Division 3 Final Four, and
we'll bet you didn't know that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll just do it silently,'' said junior Dee Jackson, the
team's leading scorer (13.6 points per game) and two-time
Massachusetts State College Athletic Conference player of the year.
``And then, people will know.''
</P>
<P>
   Know this: In 17 years, this is the 16th NCAA Tournament
appearance for the Lady Vikings, whose 76-60 victory over rival
Williams last weekend to advance to the Final Four gave it a
school-record 24 straight wins in a single season.
</P>
<P>
   And this: Tim Shea, in his 18th season at the helm, sets the
tone.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very low-key,'' explained sophomore Melissa Smock. ``We
don't get worked up as much as we would if he were screaming. We're
basically the same.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you need to be a fanatic,'' said Shea, which
seems to sum up both his personality and his program.
</P>
<P>
   After inheriting a program hovering around .500 in 1980-81, Shea
_ a Salem native who left his coaching job at Salem High School
with a three-year record of 70-3 and a state championship to coach
the Lady Vikings _ immediately turned things around, posting a
16-11 mark in his first season. The next year, his squad was 23-7
and went to the NCAAs for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably had half a dozen Salem High players those first two
or three years,'' said Shea of the quick rise. ``That gave us a big
head start.''
</P>
<P>
   Sustaining it was another matter. Shea put 22,000 miles on his
1998 Oldsmobile last year (``If I'm going to drive all that way, I
like to be comfortable'') checking out New England high school
games. ``Even at our level, recruiting is the name of the game,''
he said. A national championship in 1986 _ we'll bet you didn't
know that, either _ got the school's name out there a bit more, but
only a bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought we'd have it made,'' said Shea, now the
fifth-winningest active Division 3 coach in the country, ``that
those recruits would be walking in the door. But that wasn't so.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because the strength of Salem State's program,
ironically, puts it neither here nor there: it can't offer
scholarships, because it plays in Division 3, but neither can it
promise a recruit a lot of playing time in return for her tuition
check.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes we lose very good players because those kids want to
go somewhere and play right away,'' said Shea. ``Which is why we
have to do a lot of driving. We've got to find the right type of
kid: If she wants to put up a lot of stats, this isn't her type of
program. We don't have a lot of big scorers here, because we
usually put a team on the court that's pretty balanced.''
</P>
<P>
   What Shea calls ``dressing up'' the program helps: road trips
over the years to Puerto Rico, San Diego, Colorado Springs,
Ireland. But to a large extent, Shea's secret is a keen eye and
vivid imagination.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are players out there who get passed over left and
right,'' he said. ``You don't make it to this Final Four level
without some scholarship-level players on your team. I think we
have two or three players that some people missed the boat on.''
</P>
<P>
   One is Katie Duffey. A forward when she came out of Winnesquam
Regional High School in New Hampshire, Shea has her playing the
point. ``If she had played point guard in high school,'' he said,
``I don't think we would have got her.''
</P>
<P>
   Another is Smock, 5 feet 5 inches and slight at that. ``I'm sure
people were scared away from Missy by her size, but she can play,''
said Shea. ``I'd match her up with any 3-point shooter around.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Shea's
how-to-succeed-in-basketball-without-losing-your-mind philosophy.
Hard practices? You bet. But after two hours, it's over. No
mandatory weight lifting. No year-round monitoring. No videotape. (
Well, the team will watch some of St. Benedict on the bus down to
Western Connecticut State University in Danbury, site of the Final
Four, but only because the bus happens to have a video player.) No
chalk talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't believe in overdoing it,'' said Shea. ``The only
requirement is, you need to be able to play on the court.''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to argue with an 18-year record of 423-90 and
counting, but a couple of victories this weekend would be
especially nice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the players are confident,'' said Jackson, who was the
first female at Lynn English to score 1,000 points, graduating in
1995 with 1,172 and attending Drexel on partial scholarship for a
year before coming home. ``We figure we played so hard during the
season that we deserve to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   And deserve to be noticed as much as their Division 1 and 2
sisters, even though Shea said neither he nor his team mind not
getting as much ink. ``You'd have to have a major ego to have that
bother you,'' he said. ``They don't see me irritated about it, and
I don't think they are. In our own little world, we are being
recognized.''
</P>
<P>
   The world just got a little bigger, coach. Hope you don't mind.

EL-AMIN MIXES PIZZAZZ, SKILL FOR CONNECICUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Sometimes, he responds to reporters' questions as if
he's leaving a detailed answering machine message, trying to get in
as many words as possible before the darn thing clicks off.
</P>
<P>
   So tell us, Khalid El-Amin, are you and the other Connecticut
Huskies playing your best basketball now, in the NCAA West
Regional?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're playing good basketball that's what's scary about this
team we haven't even played our bestbasketballyetwe've
beenplayinggreatdefensivelybutwe've beendoingitinspurts,'' said the
sensational sophomore point guard following the Huskies'
second-round victory over New Mexico that vaulted it into this
week's Sweet 16 round.
</P>
<P>
   So much of what El-Amin does on the court mirrors his rapid-fire
verbiage. Often he comes at you with a quick, continuous barrage of
points or passes. He moves his 5-foot-10-inch, 203-pound frame so
well that he makes more slender players wonder why they're chasing
his shadow.
</P>
<P>
   And he blends boyishness with a maturity and court sense beyond
that of most 19-year-olds. It is as if someone put Damon
Stoudamire's skills and Magic Johnson's court awareness and
enthusiasm in John Bagley's body.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too early to compare him to our greatest players, but
he's been terrific for us, obviously,'' said UConn coach Jim
Calhoun, whose top-seeded Huskies (30-2) meet fifth-seeded Iowa
(20-9) in Thursday night's regional semifinals in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just flow in the game,'' said El-Amin, last season's Big
East Rookie of the Year and a second-team all-conference selection
this year. ``Early in the game I hit some shots and I just continue
to make shots through the whole game.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Huskies' 91-66 first-round victory over Texas-San
Antonio, El-Amin was a passing whiz, distributing the ball from
various angles and at various speeds for 10 assists. He directed an
offense that shot 55 percent from the floor and put four players in
double figures.
</P>
<P>
   In the 78-56 victory over New Mexico, El-Amin helped lead the
scoring charge, frustrating the Lobos with quick pull-up jumpers
and finishing with 21 points on 8-of-16 shooting, including 3 of 7
from 3-point range.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really go out there and say, `I'm going to do this,
I'm going to do that,' '' he said. ``It's just a game and a feel,
and whatever I feel like doing, I'm going to out there and do the
best I can.''
</P>
<P>
   His impact at UConn was almost immediate. The much-ballyhooed
recruit scored 23 points in his first and third collegiate games,
then had back-to-back 29-point efforts in his sixth and seventh
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just knew what I could do, and I didn't want to come out and
change my game in any way, shape, or form,'' said El-Amin. ``I
wanted to come out and do the things I'm capable of doing, and
Coach has given me the confidence to do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most difficult side has been the academics side of it.
Basketball is going to take care of itself. As long as you work
hard and continue to do the things you're good at, you're going to
be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   This season, El-Amin has served notice that he is the catalyst
on a team that includes Big East Player of the Year Richard
Hamilton. Entering the NCAAs, he was second on the team in assists
to Ricky Moore, which Calhoun said shows his willingness to allow
another exceptional passer to contribute to the offense.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, El-Amin he often saves some of his best outings
for big games. Against Michigan State on Dec. 5, he won the battle
of college basketball's most heralded guards, outplaying Mateen
Cleaves by scoring 20 points on 7-for-12 shooting and dishing out 6
assists in an 82-68 victory. Cleaves finished with 6 points on
2-for-15 shooting, with 7 assists.
</P>
<P>
   El-Amin's best effort undoubtedly came in a 70-59 victory at
Stanford Feb. 6. Hamilton was injured and the Huskies were coming
off their first loss of the season, a 59-42 home setback to
Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   El-Amin played well despite being the target of verbal abuse,
some of which was quite personal. In addition to teasing him about
his frame with chants such as ``Doughboy'' and ``Fat Boy,'' fans
reportedly derided El-Amin for being a Muslim and the fact that he
has been married twice and has two children.
</P>
<P>
   El-Amin responded by registering game highs in points (23),
assists (5), and steals (5). He pointed to the scoreboard when the
game was over.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the Dec. 12 contest against Pittsburgh. El-Amin,
who said that Pitt fans directed racial slurs at him, hit a runner
with two seconds left as the Huskies won, 70-69, then he stood atop
the scorer's table and taunted them back before Calhoun pulled him
down.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of those kids who at times is 12,'' said Calhoun,
``but most importantly a lot of times on the court he's 30 and he's
got an insight and feel for the game a lot of kids don't have.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it gets personal like that, it does bother me,'' said El
Amin. ``But all the `Fat Boy' taunts and things like that, that's
cool, that's part of college basketball and I accept that. But then
it gets personal, then that's not showing any class and I think I
have to speak up about that.''
</P>
<P>
   UConn came into the NCAAs with several concerns: injuries to
Jake Voskuhl and Albert Mouring, the effects of altitude at this
first-round site, and Calhoun's last-minute gastrointestinal virus.
Yet in both games, El-Amin set the tone, and his team followed his
lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just didn't want my season to end,'' said El-Amin. ``I
wanted to come out and just play as hard as I can, and try to let
the other guys feed off me so we can definitely have a tremendous
run in this tournament. So I just try to come out and lead by
example.''

 By MIKE McMANUS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Drivers caught in a snarl of freeway traffic leading into Dallas
looked up last week at that tall skyline and saw a huge new black
billboard with a few stark words in white:
 &HT;    ``Keep Using My Name In Vain, I'll Make Rush Hour Longer. GOD''
 &HT;    Those driving in from different directions saw other billboards
with equally arresting messages from the Creator:
 &HT;    ``Don't Make Me Come Down There. GOD''
 &HT;    ``What Part of `Thou Shalt Not...' Didn't You Understand? GOD''
 &HT;    ``Will the Road You Are on Get You to My Place? GOD''
 &HT;    The God Ad Campaign is being donated by local billboard
companies as a public service. There will soon be 10,000 billboards
like these all across America as billboard firms donate the space.
 &HT;    ''It is a gift to the community,'' says Nancy Fletcher,
president of the Outdoor Advertising Association of America. ''It
is a positive way to get people thinking about spirituality, and
increasing the numbers who are going to church. It makes you
believe in divine intervention!''
 &HT;    The campaign began in Broward County, Florida, in and around
Fort Lauderdale last fall. It was football season, of course. So
two of the first billboards to go up tartly said:
 &HT;    ``Let's Meet at My House Sunday Before the Game. GOD''
 &HT;    ``C'mon Over and Bring the Kids. GOD''
 &HT;    The ads were developed by The Smith Agency after an anonymous
client came in one day and told owner Andy Smith, ''I have one
goal. I need to have people start thinking about God. Things are
getting out of control. People are not obeying the rules any more.
Every day you read about murder, robbery, adultery everything that
God said, `Don't do.'
 &HT;    ''If we can get to one person before he robs a bank, to think
about God first, maybe we can stop him. If so, it will be worth
it.''
 &HT;    I tried to find out who the anonymous benefactor was even to
learn whether he was a pastor or businessman, but could learn
nothing. Oprah Winfrey offered to put the guy on her show, but he
declined: ''If people focus on me or the money I spent, they will
forget the message of the ads. Forget about me. I am looking for
nothing. The message is much more important than who I am.''
 &HT;    So let's go back to the message. This summer you may be driving
along some hot day and look up to see these billboard that ought to
get your attention:
 &HT;    ``You Think It's Hot Here? GOD''
 &HT;    ``Need a Marriage Counselor? I'm Available. GOD''
 &HT;    Some of the messages were written by the anonymous donor. They
are more gentle:
 &HT;    ``I Love You...I Love You...I Love You. GOD''
 &HT;    ``Tell the Kids That I Love Them. GOD''
 &HT;    But most were written by Charlie Robb, who describes himself as
''being in the target audience of people who used to go to church,
but who don't any more.''
 &HT;    ``I'm a former altar boy,'' he told me. To reach such people,
Scripture would not work, he says. ''We had to make the message
contemporary, slightly irreverent, reminding people that they are
dealing with the ultimate CEO.''
 &HT;    ``Need Directions? GOD''
 &HT;    ``Do You Have Any Idea Where You're Going? GOD''
 &HT;    ``Follow Me. GOD''
 &HT;    ``Have You Read My Number 1 Bestseller? There Will Be a Test. --
GOD''
 &HT;    How has the God Ad Campaign worked? The Miami Herald surveyed
churches in he area and reported that attendance rates were up.
Even Charlie has been to church a few times. A woman in Fort
Lauderdale sent an E-mail to the Smith Agency, thanking it for the
ads which are ''such a breath of fresh air.'' She said her niece
was married to a man who would never go to church with her. While
driving along, they both saw this ad:
 &HT;    ``I Loved the Wedding. Invite Me To The Marriage. GOD''
 &HT;    The man went to church with his wife for the first time the next
Sunday, and has been going ever since.
 &HT;    ``We Need To Talk. GOD''

 (s and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAUSANNE, Switzerland _ Mitt Romney hadn't known about the
vaulted ceiling, the gilded chandelier, the marble floors, the
burnished wood, the sumptuous draperies. All he knew was that his
staff had booked him into a hotel called the Beau Rivage. Nobody
told him that the lobby alone looked like Versailles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next time,'' Romney said, ``I think I'll be in the
Movenpick.''
</P>
<P>
   Until Tuesday, when he made his first report to the
International Olympic Committee's executive board, Salt Lake City's
new chief organizer had never been to Olympic headquarters. He had
never met IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch. He wasn't sure if
he should go bilingual.
</P>
<P>
   ``My French is a little rusty,'' Romney confessed, ``and I
didn't want to offend.''
</P>
<P>
   No worries there. Romney was the most popular man to show up at
the Chateau de Vidy in ages. On the eve of the most wrenching day
in IOC history, when its members are expected to expel six of their
colleagues for taking payoffs and gifts from the Salt Lake bidders,
IOC officials were delighted to see anybody from Utah who was
talking about 2002 and not 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``He presented easily and comfortably,'' said board member Kevan
Gosper of Australia after Romney had provided what is usually
considered a routine status report. ``He was quite front-footed and
positive.''
</P>
<P>
   And Romney was alone. That was a symbolic shock to IOC members
who are used to seeing a platoon of organizing committee officials
at their meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not spend travel money to have an entourage,'' Romney
declared.
</P>
<P>
   With the Salt Lake Organizing Committee still several hundred
million dollars short of breaking even, Romney has a new
philosophy: ``Profit, pride, and pageantry come second.'' After a
month on the job, he has chopped $14 million from his $1.45 billion
budget, imposed a hiring freeze, and told trustees that their free
lunches are over. And the IOC members will have no chauffeured
limousines at the Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be Blazers and Tahoes driven by volunteers,'' Romney
said.
</P>
<P>
   Romney says he'll apply the same spartan symbolism to himself.
He could have spent the week in this charming lakeside city,
chatting up IOC members over champagne and chateaubriand. Instead,
he arrived Tuesday morning, had lunch with Samaranch and the board,
and was headed home as dawn broke Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours later, the IOC was to decide whether to formally
expel the members who were ``excluded'' by the board here in
January. The cases will be heard in alphabetical order _ Agustin
Arroyo of Ecuador, Zein El Abdin Ahmed Abdel Gadir of Sudan,
Jean-Claude Ganga of the Republic of Congo, Lamine Keita of Mali,
Sergio Santander (Fantini) of Chile, and Seiuli Paul Wallwork of
Western Samoa. They will be taken up individually, with two-thirds
of the 91 votes necessary for expulsion.
</P>
<P>
   Romney saw no point in hanging around for the IOC's public
bloodletting, which stems from payoffs made by his Salt Lake
predecessors, and he wouldn't comment on anything mentioned in the
IOC, US Olympic Committee, or SLOC reports involving the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see my job to be focused entirely on 2002 and to spend no
time evaluating, investigating or speaking about the problems of
the past,'' Romney said. ``That will be left to those who had been
holding the reins during that time. I'm not going to dwell on the
past because I wasn't there.''
</P>
<P>
   But what the IOC does or doesn't do will have a decided impact
on the SLOC, which still needs $350 million from sponsors, many of
whom are wary of being linked to tarnished Olympic rings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need aggressive action, both substantive and symbolic
action, on the IOC's part,'' Romney acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC has promised that it will push through dramatic reforms
both this week and later this year. Besides expelling six members,
on top of the four who have already resigned, the IOC is expected
to change the way it selects host cities, allowing the full
membership (which already has been banned from visiting bidders) to
vote only for two finalists chosen by a smaller group. The
committee also will set up an independent outside panel to oversee
its ethics and take steps toward opening its books and reforming
the way its members are chosen.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the members leave the Palais de Beaulieu Thursday,
SLOC's chief organizer will be back in the shadow of the Mormon
Temple, tinkering with the budget and trying to persuade local
sponsors to sign on.

MONEYBOX: 10,000 MANIA 
</HEADLINE>
  By JAMES SUROWIECKI 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Well, that was fun.
</P>
<P>
   At 9:51 a.m. Tuesday, the Dow did break that vaunted 10,000
mark, and for about 30 seconds traders tossed white pieces of paper
in the air and CNBC's Maria Bartiromo smiled widely. Then the index
headed downward and spent the rest of the day meandering around the
unchanged mark. It was, in other words, a celebration worthy of the
achievement.
</P>
<P>
   There's probably something interesting to be said about our
broader cultural affection for milestones, but in this case the
hullabaloo about Dow 10,000 seems both forced and singularly
irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   To take only the most obvious point, the Dow Jones industrial
average is increasingly unrepresentative of corporate America.
Sixty years ago, when half of America's manufacturing assets were
owned by the largest 100 companies, an index of 30 companies had a
plausible claim to representativeness.
</P>
<P>
   But that's hardly the case today, although no one should
underestimate just how big the biggest U.S. companies remain. And
obviously the absence of companies like Microsoft, Intel, and
MCI/WorldCom from the index means that the fastest-growing sectors
of the economy are underrepresented by the Dow.
</P>
<P>
   But of course everyone knows that, which speaks to the odd
position that the Dow occupies in the popular imagination. You have
this index that's taken as a proxy for the stock market as a whole,
even though it doesn't tell you anything about what most stocks are
doing and tells you very little about what even large-cap stocks
are doing, and that's also taken as a proxy for the economy, even
though it tells you even less about that. In that sense, the Dow is
probably best seen as a general indicator of investors' moods,
rather than anything like a true indicator of future corporate
earnings or economic trends.
</P>
<P>
   The other thing about Dow 10,000 is even more obvious, which is
that the higher you get, the less impressive each added 1,000
points become. In 1971, there was considerable attention focused on
when the Dow would break 1,000. In 28 years, the Dow has increased
in value 10 times (assuming, for simplicity's sake, that the stocks
in the index had stayed the same). So by now, 1,000-point annual
moves should be seen as almost routine. Given the current
low-interest-rate, low-inflation environment, with corporate
earnings coming in slightly ahead of expectations, a 10 percent
annual rise in the major indices doesn't seem unlikely. (Though for
investors who have gotten used to 25 percent bumps it's going to
seem like a slowdown.)
</P>
<P>
   So Dow 11,000 could easily arrive within a year. It's a strange
concept, actually. It took almost 70 years for the Dow to rise that
first 1,000 points. Now it'll be a matter of 12 months or so.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that assumes that we can stay at these levels, and
looking back to 1971 does provide a couple of cautionary notes. In
the first place, one might ask whether corporate America is really
10 times as strong as it was in 1971. But actually I think the
answer to that question might very well be yes, when you consider
inflation, the oil crisis, profit stagnation, strong labor unions
and the fact that half of the world's economy was effectively
closed for business.
</P>
<P>
   The second caution, though, is a bit more troubling, which is
that in 1973-1974, just a year and a half after people were looking
to Dow 1,000, the market lost almost half its value. There is
nothing like 1973-1974 on the horizon. But it's still worth
remembering that investors in 1971 were just as sure that stocks
would always go up, and that you should pay any price for growth.
We're never as smart as we think we are.

CLOTHES SENSE: A LOTTA SOLE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   In these body-conscious days, feet do get their due. Ask any
girl: Shoes matter as much as hairstyle in all walks of life, and
infinitely more than gloves and hats, despite being so near the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   Buying shoes demands sizable chunks of time and money, and the
eventual decision generates more existential agony about their
looks than about their fit. Pain in the feet may be negotiable,
pain in the image never. Passion or hatred can be ignited by one
glance in a shoe store window. If the lust of a shopper's eye is
slaked by actual purchase, her willing feet accept the challenge,
her active spirit expands.
</P>
<P>
   The other night, I looked across a restaurant at a sexy young
woman who appeared to be limping. She wasn't, though, not at all,
really. She was just wearing 5-inch spike heel, 2-inch platform
sole, tight-fitting, thigh-high boots, and making her spectacular
way among the tables to the exit.
</P>
<P>
   The current display at the Museum at Fashion Institute of
Technology in New York City is called ``Shoes: A Lexicon of
Style.'' It focuses on the amazing range of design in modern
women's shoes. There's no history here, no sociological
detachment--only the look, divided into categories for maximum
impact. Drama is increased by the use of a single lighted showcase
running the length of the pitch-dark room with no interruptions, no
pauses for breath. You move along in one direction, mesmerized by a
single great sweep of shoes arranged in pairs on three rising tiers
under vivid lights. Emotional tension mounts, laughter and wonder
alternate with lust and disgust, no relief is offered, from the
first stiletto heel to the last bulbous Nike.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from a few historic examples, such as some satin pumps
with celluloid heels from 1928, most of these styles date from the
last three decades, even from the last three years. This show
indicates that only in the last third of this century have
designers really hit their stride with varieties of shoe material,
shoe shape, shoe trim and shoe attachment. Nevertheless, one of my
favorites here was designed in 1958 by Herbert Levine: a pair of
stiletto-heeled soles with no uppers at all, nothing but some
invisible adhesive pads to hold each shoe against the wearer's bare
sole. These shoes would look as if they had grown there, by some
potent fashion sorcery.
</P>
<P>
   Another great shoe moment is a 1993 pair of ``tabi toe'' ankle
boots by Martin Margiela. Japanese tabi are white cotton socks with
a practical cleft between big and second toe to go under thong
sandals, but as a beige leather, high-heeled boot, the effect is
that of a perfect cloven hoof. I once saw these being worn in
Paris. Emerging casually from under a pair of pants, they made my
hair stand on end.
</P>
<P>
   Suggestive shoe artifice comes in many varieties. One curious
example by Junya Watanabe is a flat shoe draped and upholstered in
rose and gold brocade, so that each foot becomes a rich little
shoe-shaped cushion at the nethermost point of the body.
</P>
<P>
   Opposed to that is the lethal weapon style, which usually
involves a fierce high heel, often skinny and slanted in an odd
direction, like a half-open switchblade, with fastenings for the
shoe that run to grim metallic buckles or very toothy zippers.
</P>
<P>
   Even fiercer is a high-heeled sandal by Todd Oldham with straps
of spiky barbed wire that cross the foot and climb up around the
calf. This sandal seems to attack the wearer's tender skin and the
viewer's horrified eye together, until we learn from the label that
it's really all made of soft rubber and must feel deliciously
tickly. On the other hand, of course, there's Dr. Scholl's health
sandal, but even that wholesome item (in this show, anyway) boasts
a leopard-print strap.
</P>
<P>
   At the end comes the ``Sneaker Chic'' section. Now we enter the
huge athletic universe of canvas and rubber, with all its high-tech
spinoffs and hangers-on. Manolo Blahnik gives way to Acupuncture
and New Balance, to Reebok and Adidas, and the host of others
stemming from the original Keds of 1917.
</P>
<P>
   Here, all feet are big. Gender becomes irrelevant, the erotic
pull comes only from the thing itself. In this world, the
watchwords are stability, traction, and support.
</P>
<P>
   But no one is fooled: The look is the true issue. So potent is
the element of style in active sport shoes that great fashion
designers have gone for it, producing hybrids such as Gaultier's
spike-heeled sneakers, and Chanel's black deck-shoe-cum-sneaker,
with the big double C gleaming on its white toe.
</P>
<P>
   Fashion is at its most volatile in the sport shoe world. Hip
insider models can die in a few months, if the mainstream adopts
them, and be quickly replaced by new cult favorites. Much urban
chic thus dwells in beautifully engineered shoes built for strain
but worn by people who would never dream of putting them to the
test. Beau Brummell, who invented modern urban cool in the 1790s,
would thoroughly approve of such delicate perversity. Only style is
the true test. Utility is really of no interest, but its presence
is essential. It governs the beauty of the shoe.
</P>
<P>
   Since that's the point, the foot retreats from the visual game,
and the enveloping shoe leads its own bright life. As we move along
the showcase, these shoes begin more and more to resemble pairs of
small sports cars and to suggest similar methods of marketing and
design. Here we find the vivid brand names, the poetic model names,
the features invented for their function but displayed for their
looks--all evoking motion, action, swift personal transport,
perhaps into a better world.
</P>
<P>
   This show is on until April 17. If you go, don't forget to buy
the illuminating book by its curator, Valerie Steele. It's full of
keen insights and dazzling supplementary photos showing many of the
shoes at work. Book and show together will have you rushing out
shopping yet again.

MURRAY SEEKS TO ALLAY FEARS AT BANKBOSTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN WILMSEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- It was a sight few in the crowded BankBoston Corp.
auditorium had likely ever imagined: The chief executive of
archrival Fleet Financial Group, Terrance Murray, taking the stage.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, the hard-edged, street-fighting Murray was viewed
from BankBoston's venerable halls not only as an enemy but as the
brash antithesis of BankBoston's patrician culture.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday, just a day after announcing Fleet would acquire
BankBoston to create the nation's eighth largest bank, Murray set
foot in enemy territory and received an unanticipated standing
ovation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to tell you, I never expected to be introducing Terry
Murray in the BankBoston auditorium to a standing ovation,''
Charles Gifford, BankBoston's chief executive, told employees who
stood in the auditorium's aisles and jammed a lobby outside.
Gifford will become chief operating officer of the proposed $178
billion Fleet Boston Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Joking with Gifford as if they were old friends, Murray took
questions for an hour from BankBoston employees in 38 BankBoston
offices around the world where the meeting was broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   He said the arduous job of merging banks of such size and vastly
differing cultures would take a year and a half. But he played down
the differences between the former rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sense is that in time you're going to find we're not as
sharp-edged as you think we are, and we're going to find you less
warm and fuzzy than we think you are,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Murray sought to allay fears of Fleet's ``slash-and-burn''
reputation in eliminating jobs at banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``BankBoston has been more artful than we may have been in the
past, and there is something to be learned from that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet identified $700 million in potential cuts through job
eliminations and consolidations as it researched the deal, but
Murray said $600 million in cuts is ``a more reasonable'' figure to
expect. Fleet has said some 5,000 jobs will be cut, many of them
through attrition and hiring freezes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll try to go about that in a business-like and humane
way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he warned that managers will be forced to make
tough decisions about job eliminations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't achieve those (cost cutting goals) the market is
going to kill us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to questions from employees in Brazil and Argentina,
Murray said he expects BankBoston's prized Latin American
operations to grow in the next three to five years.
</P>
<P>
   The unexpected drop in Fleet's stock price as Wall Street
reacted unenthusiastically to the deal was caused by arbitrage
traders who had anticipated the merger and bet on it ahead of time,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a question possibly suggestive of fears about life under
Fleet management, one employee asked if Murray planned to abolish a
BankBoston tradition, casual day.
</P>
<P>
   Murray quipped that during negotiations Gifford had offered to
lower the bank's price in order to continue allowing employees to
dress down once a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've frankly never heard of the concept,'' Murray said.

</P>
<P>
   BARBARA-BARRY-DESIGN (Los Angeles) _ In a town that cultivates
surface glow over darker depths, Barbara Barry, the designer, known
for her green tea- and mahogany-hued interiors that look like
colorized stills from Hepburn and Tracy's ``Desk Set,'' has the art
of presentation down cold. And when it gets chilly, despite the gas
fire, Ms. Barry quickly produces matching cashmere shawls. ``I want
to help people live a beautiful life. Design is a religion for
me.'' By Julie V. Iovine.
</P>
<P>
   GRAZER-HOME (Hollywood) _ What happens when one of Hollywood's
most successful producers, Brian Grazer, buys a home in the high
reaches of Pacific Palisades and starts overhauling the interiors?
He behaves like _ what else? _ a successful Hollywood producer. By
Bernard Weinruab.
</P>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD-MALL (Hollywood) _ How do you create a mall that gives
tangible form to an illusion? How do you make it an attraction that
draws both the tourists that celebrities wish to avoid and the
celebrities that tourists yearn to see? How do you create a theater
there that can be queen for one day (for the Academy Awards) and a
working girl for the rest of the year? These were just some of the
many conundrums facing developers and designers of Hollywood and
Highland, a mammoth urban entertainment and retail development that
will have a new Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences theater
as its anchor in March 2001. By Frances Anderton.
</P>
<P>
   LOS-ANGELES-DESIGN (Undated) _ The winter months have seen an
avalanche of books on Los Angeles design, ranging from Monacelli's
new, definitive and splendid ``Frank O. Gehry: The Complete
Works,'' so heavy you would need a few work-outs to lift it, to
two, yes, two compendiums from the Spanish company Editorial
Gustavo Gili on R.M. Schindler, among the first of several
immigrants to plant the seeds of European Modernism in Los Angeles
in the 1920s. By Frances Anderton.
</P>
<P>
   GARDEN-Q&AMP;A (Undated) _ Gardening questions answered. By Leslie
Land.
</P>
<P>
   TULIPS (Undated) _ ``You never know why a love affair starts,''
said Anna Pavord, a British garden writer who has had quite an
affair with the tulip. Moreover, she said, ``an affair can't be
sustained over a long period unless that object of your affection
is mysterious and endlessly fascinating, revealing things you
didn't know _ it's such an incredibly complicated flower.'' By Ann
Raver.
</P>
<P>
   EDTV (Undated) _ Ed and Ray Pekurny are not what you'd call
stylish dudes. Ed's idea of an accessory is the beer bottle hanging
around his neck. Ray wants to own a gym, and he has the gross tank
tops and baggy sweats to prove it. Matthew McConaughey and Woody
Harrelson play the blue-collar Pekurny brothers in Ron Howard's new
movie, ``EDtv,'' which opens on March 26. Part ``The Truman Show,''
part Bud Lite commercial, this amiable romantic comedy imagines
what would happen if a cable network trained its cameras on a
Regular Guy 24 hours a day and turned his life into the ultimate
reality-television show. By Rick Marin.

   HOME-IMPROVEMENT (Undated) _ The Home Improvement column. By
Edward Lipinski.

 &HT;    Gourmet or family-friendly, meals go together beautifully when
you finesse them with foil
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker

<P>
   Whether you are in the mood for a gourmet entree like Tarragon
Chicken Breast With Mushroom Sauce or a family feast like Cajun
Sausage and Beans, the secret to success is in the packet.
</P>
<P>
   Cooking in foil packets creates moist, steamy dishes quickly.
And cleanup goes even quicker. There are only a few things to keep
in mind.
</P>
<P>
   Regular foil will work fine, but heavy-duty foil is better,
particularly if you want to place the packets directly on the oven
rack or grill grate.
</P>
<P>
   Check out the directions here for making a packet _ but don't be
afraid to perfect your own folding method. Just be sure to leave an
air pocket inside so heat can circulate and create a tight seam so
juices won't leak.
</P>
<P>
   Some like to spray the foil lightly with cooking spray. You may
choose to put the packets on a baking sheet or right on the oven
rack or grate. And be careful when opening so your hands won't get
steamed.

   Bay Scallops With Roasted Bell Pepper
</P>
<P>
   Makes 4 servings
</P>
<P>
   Preparation time: 25 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Cooking time: 8 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Because of their small size, bay scallops are quickly overcooked
when sauteed on the stovetop. Here, Jacqueline Mallorca, author of
``The Perfect Dinner: Fine Food Cooked With Foil'' ($22.95, Fair
Oaks Press), offers a quick steam in a foil packet with fresh,
aromatic vegetables as a better way to enjoy these tiny, sweet
gifts from the sea.
</P>
<P>
   Olive oil spray
</P>
<P>
   2 yellow bell peppers, broiled, peeled and sliced in 3/4-inch
diamonds
</P>
<P>
   4 green onions, including pale green leaves, chopped
</P>
<P>
   4 small ripe tomatoes, peeled, seeded and chopped
</P>
<P>
   4 teaspoons capers, drained
</P>
<P>
   1 1/4 pounds tiny bay scallops
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons chopped parsley
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 400 degrees. For each serving, lightly spray the
center area of a 16-inch length of foil with olive oil. Combine one
quarter of the bell pepper, onion, tomato and capers to one side of
the center of each piece of foil. Top with a quarter of the
scallops, season with salt and pepper and sprinkle with 1
tablespoon parsley. Spray with olive oil.
</P>
<P>
   Fold the foil pieces over the scallops and vegetables; then fold
and tightly crimp the edges together to form packets. Place the
packets on a baking sheet and bake for 8 minutes. On a dinner
plate, slit open the packet's straight side and withdraw the foil,
leaving the scallop mixture and its aromatic juices on the center
of the plate.
</P>
<P>
   To serve, spoon rice around the scallops and over the juices.

<P>
   Cooking time: about 1 3/4 hours
</P>
<P>
   This Reynolds Kitchens recipe is ideal if you need to feed a
crowd and plan to have the grill hot for a few hours. If not, you
can cook the pork for the first 1 1/2 hours in the oven at 375
degrees, and then finish over high flames on a gas grill for the
last 20 minutes. The result will be tender, tangy meat with a smoky
char.
</P>
<P>
   For the seasoning rub:
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 teaspoons salt

<P>
   1 1/2 teaspoons paprika
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon pepper
</P>
<P>
   3 pounds boneless pork loin or shoulder roast
</P>
<P>
   1 sheet (18 by 24 inches) heavy-duty aluminum foil
</P>
<P>
   For the vinegar-pepper sauce:
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 cups cider vinegar
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons granulated sugar

   1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
</P>
<P>
   Hamburger or sandwich buns
</P>
<P>
   Preheat grill to medium. Combine sugar, salt, paprika and
pepper. Sprinkle and rub seasoning over roast, turning to coat
evenly. Put roast on foil.
</P>
<P>
   In a bowl, combine cider vinegar, 2 tablespoons sugar, red
pepper flakes, salt, cayenne and Worcestershire sauce. Set aside.

   Bring up sides of foil and double fold. Double fold one end to
seal. Through open end, add 1/2 cup vinegar-pepper sauce; reserve
remaining sauce. Double fold remaining end, leaving room for heat
circulation inside packet.
</P>
<P>
   Grill 1 1/2 hours or until roast is tender on medium in covered
grill. Carefully remove steamed roast from foil and place directly
on grill. Reserve 1/2 cup vinegar-pepper sauce to use on
sandwiches. Brush roast generously with remaining sauce. Continue
grilling 15 to 20 minutes on medium in uncovered grill, brushing
with sauce and turning every 5 minutes to cook evenly. Remove roast
from grill. Slice or shred roast while warm. Combine with reserved
sauce. Serve shredded pork on hamburger buns. Top with coleslaw, if

   When you buy expensive fish, the last thing you want is to end
up with something dry and indelicate. That's why fish is one of the
best foods for cooking in foil packets _ it creates a nice, moist,
steaming environment. This recipe calls for sauteing the vegetables
in a pan first _ an extra step, but it's worth it.
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon butter or olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 large carrot, cut in 1/4-inch dice
</P>
<P>
   1 onion, cut in 1/4-inch dice
</P>
<P>
   2 celery ribs, cut in 1/4-inch dice
</P>
<P>
   2 shallots, minced
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon minced parsley (optional)
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon dried tarragon
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper
</P>
<P>
   Nonstick cooking spray
</P>
<P>
   6 salmon fillets (about 1 1/2 inches thick and 5 to 5 1/2 ounces
each)
</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons dry white wine
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 350 degrees. In a skillet, heat butter or olive
oil. Add carrot, onion, celery and shallots and saute until tender,
about 10 minutes (do not brown). Stir in parsley and tarragon and
season lightly with salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Cut 6 sheets of aluminum foil (about 12 by 30 inches each) and
fold crosswise in half to form a double thickness. Lightly oil each
foil sheet or spray with nonstick cooking spray. Place a fillet in
the center of each foil rectangle. Top each fillet with an equal
amount of vegetables. Drizzle wine and olive oil in equal amounts
over each fillet. Bring the sides of the foil up to meet over the
fish. Fold the edges together, then fold over tightly to form a
seal, but leaving room inside.
</P>
<P>
   Place packets on the lower middle level of the oven and bake for
about 15 minutes (allow 10 minutes per inch of fillet thickness).
If fillet sizes vary, place packets with thicker slices in the back
so that thinner fillets may be easily removed from the oven first.
Fish is done when flesh feels springy to the touch, flakes with a
fork and is opaque all the way through. Serve in packets at the
table, or slide each fillet and its juices onto a dinner plate. _

</P>
<P>
   Foil
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons butter or margarine, softened, divided
</P>
<P>
   2 large shallots, finely chopped
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon dried tarragon
</P>
<P>
   8 white mushrooms, sliced
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons pale dry Spanish sherry or favorite vinegar
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   2 fresh boneless, skinless chicken breast halves (about 5 ounces

</P>
<P>
   Place baking sheet in oven. Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Grease the centers of two 16-inch-long pieces of foil with 1/2
tablespoon butter each.
</P>
<P>
   In a skillet, melt remaining butter. Add shallots and cook 2
minutes, until just softened. Stir in tarragon and mushrooms, and
saute until barely cooked, about 3 minutes. Stir in sherry and
season with salt and pepper to taste. Add cream and let it simmer
for 30 seconds, stirring frequently.
</P>
<P>
   Transfer one-fourth of the mushroom sauce to one piece of foil,
to one side of the center. Top with chicken breast and another
fourth of the sauce. Fold foil over the chicken; then fold and
tightly crimp the edges together to form a D-shaped packet. Repeat
with second foil packet. Transfer packets to the hot baking sheet
and bake for 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   On a dinner plate, slit open the packet's straight side and
withdraw the foil, leaving the chicken and mushroom sauce on the
plate.
</P>

 &HT;    Against all odds: Demise of Phoenix a sad event
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ We had come to pay respects, mourners in the midst of
the usual merriment. An evening at Phoenix Brewing Company was
always a grand time, but there would be no more. When the Atlanta
restaurant closed earlier this month, some were shocked, many
surprised and anyone who'd been there just plain sorry.
</P>
<P>
   This was Atlanta's showcase brewpub, by acclamation the crown
jewel. Among the 11 area restaurants brewing their own beer on
premises, none came close to matching the German lagers that
Phoenix brought off with finesse and style, and none even attempted
the cuisine that earned Phoenix a reputation as one of Atlanta's
premier places to dine. The most thoroughly satisfying meal I've
had in Atlanta might have been a dish of Chilean sea bass prepared
by former chef Kevin Fonzo, accompanied by a couple of glasses of
Sprouse's assertive, hoppy pilsner.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, after four years of glowing reviews, it failed. Bills
incurred at its opening finally were too much to repay, even when
business was doing well.
</P>
<P>
   And so a table of friends and admirers gathered on a Sunday
evening, most invited by brewmaster Glen Sprouse to have a last
beer or two on the house. There was a moment when a tall glass of
the Seven Sisters Munchener, Phoenix's signature beer, stood almost
like a memorial to the brewpub that set for itself the highest
standards. Soon a pilsner was poured from the conditioning tank,
not quite ready but as ready as it was going to get. What a shame,
someone said, that Sprouse's majestic maibock _ the most complex
beer anyone has brewed in Atlanta _ would not be on hand when May
rolled around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in the business 30 years and this was my best
work,'' said Warren Bruno, one of Sprouse's partners and a veteran
Atlanta restaurateur. ``I've sold and closed restaurants and moved
on, but when we closed Phoenix, I wept.''
</P>
<P>
   Restaurants fail for myriad reasons _ competition, quality of
food and service, location. None of these could be laid at
Phoenix's door, even if its location in back of the Prado Shopping
Center was less than ideal. ``We were just undercapitalized, that's
the long and the short of it,'' Bruno says. ``We started out in the
hole and could never climb out of it. And we never had a budget for
promotion and advertising. That hurt us, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix was 8,000 square feet _ large for an upscale/casual
dining restaurant _ and it seated 240 people. When it opened four
years to the day it closed, it had the feel of elegance and the
prices to go with it. Game and seafood entrees ranged from $17 to
$24. The cozy bar was off to the side, secluded from the dining
area.
</P>
<P>
   Impressive as it was, the traffic of people willing to spend $25
and more for dinner, especially on a weeknight, was on the steady
side rather than of the packed-house kind. With its ambience and
the menu, Phoenix was not a place that attracted a younger, singles
crowd. A remodeling two years ago gave the place a looser, pub
atmosphere, and it was not long before the dreaded chicken wings
were on the menu. Anything to stay alive.
</P>
<P>
   Business quickly picked up. But it was not enough to reduce the
taxes incurred at the outset, the mounting debt service on loans,
the electricity bills that ran deep into four figures every month.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we opened,'' Bruno says, ``we were what brewpubs had
evolved to in California.''
</P>
<P>
   They are not there yet in Atlanta, and only an optimist would
believe they ever will be. Five years from now, Bruno says, there
might well be more brewpubs in Atlanta _ maybe as many as 15 or 20
_ ``but they'll be chains, places like Hops. There won't be
anything like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed there won't.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   The resuscitation of Ringwood
</P>
<P>
   All beer begins with yeast, although mass-market beers such as
Budweiser, Miller and Coors have so little you'd never know it. Not
many beers have Ringwood yeast, a strain developed 200 years ago
and still breathing. The strain was resuscitated in the late '70s,
when an Englishman named Peter Austin opened a small brewery in the
Hampshire town of Ringwood, employing open-fermentation and
brick-clad brew kettles. Since then microbreweries on four
continents have bought the Peter Austin System, as it's called, and
produced ales of a distinctly English character.
</P>
<P>
   New Knoxville ales are among the few in the Southeast that use
Ringwood yeast (Water Tower brewpub in Kennesaw (Ga.) also uses
such a system). The British style is firm yet restrained,
preferring balance to over-the-top hoppiness. New Knoxville's India
Pale Ale is an excellent domestic example, the Ringwood yeast
imparting a slight dryness and a noticeable estery character.
</P>
<P>
   A still more interesting example is New Knoxville Porter, a
re-creation of a porter brewed in that city a century ago. The
brewery's name, in fact, harks back to a Tennessee brewery that
produced mostly ales in the days before Prohibition.
</P>
<P>
   Less hoppy than some porters from American micros, New Knoxville
is robust in an understated way and nicely accented by a
bittersweet finish. It hints at a time when English-style ales were
as common in the South as pilsners in Pennsylvania.

 &HT;    With spring's arrival, celebrate religious customs
 &HT;    By Betty Parham
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ During the Easter/Passover season, which is one of the
most significant and meaningful times of the year for both
Christians and Jews, the Internet presents a wonderful opportunity
for each to deepen their understanding of the other.
</P>
<P>
   A flickering candle and the question, ``Why is this night
different from all other nights?'' welcome you at
http://www.holidays.net/passover/, a well-done site, especially for
those who want to familiarize themselves with the Passover
observance.
</P>
<P>
   For bunnies, bonnets and Easter egg hunts, you will have to look
elsewhere, but at http://www.njwebworks.com/easter/index
</P>
<P>
   .shtml, you will find a serious look at the religious
significance, history and traditions of the most significant date
on the Christian calendar. At
http://www.sweetgifts.com/aprilhol.htm, find a complete rundown of
both observances.
</P>
<P>
   A common thread through much of the Internet material on Easter
and Passover is the use of food _ symbolically, in ritual, in
celebration and as a means to pass down ancient stories.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Easter story as told in the New Testament took place
during the Jewish Passover _ indeed the Last Supper of Christ and
his disciples was a Passover meal _ many of the themes of Passover
transferred to what was to become the Easter observance.
</P>
<P>
   One food that holds very different but deep significance to both
Christians and Jew during this season is bread.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps there is no food as beloved or meaningful to Jews around
the world as matzo. To partake of this simple, unleavened flat
bread or cracker is to rise above symbolism and eat the bread of
ancestors who were commanded by Moses 3,000 years ago to flee Egypt
to freedom in such haste that they had no time to let the bread
they were preparing rise.
</P>
<P>
   You can learn all about matzo and meet the Manischewitz family,
who have been commercially producing matzo for more than 100 years,
at http://www.manischewitz.com/.
</P>
<P>
   A wonderful essay on the eating of matzo can be found at
http://www.rj.org/uahc/congs/la
</P>
<P>
   /la002/matsheat.html.
</P>
<P>
   And, at http:// www.marketnet.com/kosher
</P>
<P>
   /matzoh.html, you will find fascinating information (especially
if you're unfamiliar with it) on keeping a kosher home and dietary
preparations for the Passover observance.
</P>
<P>
   A very different kind of bread plays a central role in Easter
celebrations, especially among some Orthodox Christians. Easter
bread, a sweet yeast bread rich in eggs, butter and other
ingredients, is symbolic of Christ himself. It is sometimes baked
as a round loaf decorated with a lamb or braided cross. Sometimes
the entire loaf is braided into a circle, giving it a crown effect
. For instructions, see http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley
</P>
<P>
   .edu/(tilde)isk/netmagic.d/easter.html.
</P>
<P>
   Hot Cross Buns (see recipe) are another old Easter tradition,
usually served on Good Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Two excellent sites that you may want to visit to compare the
foods of Easter and Passover are http://www.fwfs.com/april.htm and
http://
</P>
<P>
   www.citipage.com/wjac/kitchen/hk6.html.
</P>
<P>
   You will learn, for instance, that horseradish in the Jewish
tradition signifies the bitterness of slavery and in the Christian
tradition, the passion of Christ. For Jews, salt at the Passover
table signifies tears shed during enslavement and for Christians,
fasting and self-denial and a reminder of Christ's words ``You are
the salt of the earth.''

   Although Easter and Passover are based on the beliefs of people
of different faiths with different rituals and customs, by visiting
sites relating to both, you may also see how both are bound
together.
</P>
<P>
   Easter is about renewal. Passover marks a new beginning. Both
celebrate a hope common to us all.

<P>
   Cooking time: 18 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Cooling/chilling time: 35 minutes
</P>
<P>
   If you are terrified of Passover baking, just make this. It's a
winner, and you do not need any special techniques or even a candy
thermometer to make it.
</P>
<P>
   4 to 6 unsalted matzo boards or sheets
</P>
<P>
   1 cup unsalted butter or unsalted Passover margarine
</P>
<P>
   1 cup firmly packed light brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup chocolate chips or coarsely chopped semisweet chocolate
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Line completely with foil a large
18-by-12-inch cookie sheet with sides. Cover bottom of pan with
baking parchment _ on top of foil. This is very important as
mixture becomes sticky during baking. Line bottom of pan evenly
with matzo boards, cutting extra pieces of matzo as required to fit
any spaces on the cookie sheet as evenly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Combine margarine or butter and brown sugar in a 3-quart,
heavy-bottomed saucepan. Cook over medium heat, stirring
constantly, until mixture comes to a boil. Continue cooking 3 more
minutes, stirring constantly. Remove from heat and pour over matzo
and spread evenly with a metal spatula.
</P>
<P>
   Place in oven and immediately reduce heat to 350. Bake 15
minutes, checking every few minutes to make sure mixture is not
burning. If it seems to be browning too quickly, remove from oven,
lower heat to 325 and return to oven to cook.
</P>
<P>
   Remove from oven and sprinkle matzo boards immediately with
chocolate. Let stand 5 minutes, then spread melted chocolate over
matzo. While still warm, cut into squares or odd shapes using a
large knife. Chill in refrigerator until set, about 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   This makes a good gift. You can also serve it in confectioners'
paper cups as a candy.
</P>
<P>
   Variation: You can also use coarsely chopped white chocolate, or
a combination of chocolates, and sprinkle toasted almonds on top as
the chocolate sets.

<P>
   2 packages active dry yeast
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup warm (110-115 degrees) water
</P>
<P>
   1 cup warm (110-115 degrees) milk
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup softened butter or margarine
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon vanilla extract
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
</P>
<P>
   6 1/2 to 7 cups all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   4 eggs
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup dried currants
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup raisins
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons water
</P>
<P>
   1 egg yolk
</P>
<P>
   1 recipe icing (below)
</P>
<P>
   In large mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Add warm
milk, sugar, butter, vanilla, salt, nutmeg and 3 cups flour. Beat
until smooth. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each
addition. Stir in currants and raisins and more flour (3 1/2 to 4
cups), enough to make a soft dough.
</P>
<P>
   Turn dough out on a floured surface and knead until smooth and
elastic, about 6 to 8 minutes. Pat into a ball and place in a large
greased bowl, turning over to grease top of dough. Cover with a
damp towel or plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until
doubled in size (about 1 hour).
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Punch dough down and shape into 30
balls about the size of a large lemon. Place on greased baking
sheets. Using a sharp knife, cut a cross, or X, on the top of each
roll. Cover again and let rise until doubled (about 1 hour).
</P>
<P>
   In a small bowl, beat 2 tablespoons water and egg yolk together
and brush over the rolls. Bake for 12 to 17 minutes until nicely
browned. Cool on wire racks for 1 hour. Drizzle icing over the top
of each roll following the lines of the cut cross.
</P>
<P>
   For the icing: Combine 1 cup confectioners' sugar, 4 teaspoons
milk or cream, a dash of salt and 1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract.
Stir until smooth. Adjust sugar and milk to make a mixture that
flows easily.
</P>
<P>
   Tip: Put icing in a small plastic bag and snip off a corner to
drizzle neatly.
</P>
<P>
   Per roll: 164 calories, 4 grams protein, 3 grams fat (percent
calories from fat, 18), 29 grams carbohydrates, 37 milligrams
cholesterol, 122 milligrams sodium, 1 gram fiber.

 &HT;    Don't let lifestyle foil plans for complete meal: Aluminum
cookery's quick, and cleanup easy
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   You've had one of those
``better-get-a-million-things-done-before-the-new-millennium'' kind
of days.
</P>
<P>
   How you'd just love to settle down to a glass of wine and a nice
home-cooked dinner. But you're not up for any heavy-duty cooking.
And the prospect of scrubbing pots and pans afterward is simply too
much to bear.
</P>
<P>
   There is a silver lining here. And in all likelihood, it's
already in your cabinet _ right next to the wax paper and plastic
wrap.
</P>
<P>
   Yep, we're talking about aluminum foil. Tear off a sheet, plop a
thawed chicken breast or piece of fish on top, add veggies and
seasonings, then roll up into a packet. Bake it, serve it and _
here's the best part _ when you've finished dinner, simply crumple
and toss the foil in the trash.
</P>
<P>
   Sound like a cooking technique from a Girl Scouts handbook? It's
probably in there.
</P>
<P>
   But in case you think this method is for quick-but-not-great
food, check out a new cookbook, ``The Perfect Dinner,'' by longtime
San Francisco Chronicle columnist Jacqueline Mallorca ($22.95, Fair
Oaks Press).
</P>
<P>
   Mallorca points out that today's foil-packet cookery is the
natural descendant to the classic cuisine en papillote _ cooking in
parchment paper. And her book includes several recipes sure to meet
gourmet standards, such as bay scallops with roasted bell peppers
and tarragon chicken breast with mushroom sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, the folks in the aluminum foil industry are eager to
help prove that point. And because you can customize each packet,
it's an ideal way to prepare that thawed chicken to satisfy the
``onions-are-awful'' kid, the ``mushrooms-are-gross'' teenager and
the ``no-salt-please'' spouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have such hectic lifestyles these days, they want to
get in and out of the kitchen,'' said Pat Schweitzer, a home
economist in the Reynolds Kitchens. She co-stars with fellow
economist Betty Thompson Morton in commercials for Reynolds Wrap.
``With foil packets, you can make individual meals quickly and
really cut down on the cleanup time.''
</P>
<P>
   Morton and Schweitzer have created a number of recipes, such as
the Cajun Sausage and Beans or Far East Spiced Chicken recipes
inside, that make the most of the foil-packet method. Many more can
be found at the Web site http://www.reynoldswrap.com.
</P>
<P>
   There, you'll also find directions for making foil packets,
though directions are hardly needed. In most cases, you don't
tightly wrap food, as you might a baked potato. Rather, you encase
the food in the foil, leaving an air pocket so steam can develop
but creating a tight seam so juices don't leak. Sometimes you add a
sauce or a few ice cubes to help create moisture and add flavor.
</P>
<P>
   The foil-packet method works especially well for boneless
chicken breasts, fish fillets, beef slices and pork chops. You can
combine them with vegetables that are compatible and cook the whole
meal in one stroke. It's best to cut vegetables into small pieces,
especially carrots and potatoes, so they will cook through.
</P>
<P>
   While the packet method works beautifully in the oven, it has
its drawbacks on the grill. Sure, cleanup will be easier. And the
delicate fish or small veggies won't slip through the grate. The
wrap, though, likely will limit the amount of smoky flavor that is
the advantage of grilling.
</P>
<P>
   But for those who've always had trouble cooking up tender, juicy
ribs outdoors, Schweitzer touts the foil-packet method. First, cook
the ribs in a foil packet for up to an hour, allowing the steaming
process to soften and cook the meat. Then unwrap the ribs and cook
them directly on the grill, brushing with sauce, to finish.
</P>
<P>
   We liked the method for using foil to make North Carolina-style
pork barbecue and offer that recipe inside _ along with others we
tried from Reynolds Wrap and from Mallorca's cookbook. All need no
more than a vegetable or salad and perhaps some bread to make a
complete meal.
</P>
<P>
   TIPS FOR COOKING WITH FOIL PACKETS
</P>
<P>
   There are many advantages to cooking with foil packets,
including saving time. Foil conducts heat to its contents without
delay, so many entrees cook in only 10 minutes. Here are some tips
to keep in mind:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Packets can be assembled and refrigerated for up to three
hours in advance. Bring them to room temperature before they go
into the oven, or add two minutes to the cooking time.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Always cook foil packets in one layer on one baking sheet
positioned on the center rack.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Bake only as many packets at one time as you can reasonably
handle.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  For most dishes, preheating the oven and baking sheet is
critical. (Allow 10 to 15 minutes for an oven to preheat.)
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Some experts claim that the shiny side of the foil will
deflect some oven heat while the dull side absorbs it. But others
detect no difference.

 &HT;    Nothing dull about these delicious cakes for teatime
 &HT;    By Marcia Langhenry
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Marietta Fields of Marietta (Ga.) must have been
thinking of Mother Dull's Tea Cakes when she asked our readers for
their help finding ``an old-fashioned tea cake like my grandmother
made for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Many sent Mrs. S.R. Dull's recipe from her often-reprinted book,
``Southern Cooking.'' A few others came in, too, but they didn't
sound quite right, because Fields remembered her grandmother using
buttermilk and soda.
</P>
<P>
   We tested the tea cakes in Mrs. Dull's original recipe _ with
their high-cholesterol combination of butter and lard _ from the
copy passed along by Betty Berrey of Duluth. The recipe makes a
delicious, not-too-sweet tea biscuit that can be sweetened to taste
with filling, frosting or a dusting of sparkling sugar.
</P>
<P>
   We don't know what we'll do with that leftover lard. But the
extra buttermilk probably will find its way into some of those soft
pretzels in this week's Low-Fat Cooking column.

   &QR;  Susan W. Vaughn of Conyers is looking for a recipe for Hot
Water Corn Bread. After reading about it in a cookbook that
extolled the bread's unique texture, caused by the hot water, she
was disappointed to find that the book didn't contain the recipe.

 &HT;    POWERFUL LEADER OF ISRAEL'S ULTRA-RELIGIOUS JEWS CONVICTED OF
BRIBERY
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ After a four-year trial fraught with incendiary
ethnic overtones, an Israeli court Wednesday convicted of bribery
the political leader of the country's Sephardic ultra-orthodox
Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Arieh Deri, 40, rose quickly to top posts in the government of
slain Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and would later lead his
fast-growing movement into its close alliance with current
right-wing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   The Moroccan-born Deri helped found Shas, a party that
represents ultra-Orthodox, Sephardic Jews. The Sephardic Jews come
from Asian and North African countries. Despite numbering half of
Israel's Jewish population, they have long felt excluded from power
by the Ashkenazi Jews, of European descent.
</P>
<P>
   The panel of three judges found Deri guilty of taking $155,000
in bribes and illegally steering government money to Shas
organizations. He plans to appeal the conviction, but will be
sentenced March 25 and could face up to seven years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The conviction disqualifies him from top posts in government but
he could be allowed to remain in the Israeli parliament, the
Knesset.
</P>
<P>
   Shas holds 10 seats in the 120-seat parliament. As a key swing
vote in creating government coalitions, the party has been
successful at winning government money for Shas schools and welfare
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   The Sephardic-Ashkenazi divide is a bitter cleft in Israeli
culture and the Deri trial, which was held periodically over the
years with frequent breaks, created a tension somewhat like that
around racially charged trials in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Judges reported that their lives had been threatened, and by the
time the verdict was announced live on the radio -- cameras were
not allowed in the courtroom -- police braced for violent street
demonstrations from Deri's followers.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the several hundred Shas supporters outside the
district court were peaceful and the scene itself illustrated the
rifts in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The courthouse happens to be located in an Arab section of
Jerusalem, so ultra-Orthodox Sephardic Jews in their black suits
and black fedoras or skullcaps, chanted and prayed in front of Arab
storefronts while little Arab schoolgirls looked on in
bewilderment.
</P>
<P>
   They were separated from the court by hundreds of Israeli
police, some wielding assault rifles. A small group of college-aged
secular protesters, including women with dyed pinkish hair and
skimpy tank tops, demonstrated nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fact that two of the three judges were themselves
Sephardic Jews, Shas members vouched for Deri's innocence and said
he was being taken down by a racist system that is scared of Shas
and the ultra-Orthodox.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very painful for us,'' said 21-year-old David Amal, a
religious student. ``He is the man who made the whole Sephardic
world and Jewish world rise up.''
</P>
<P>
   Shas supporters predicted that Deri's prosecution would draw
more voters to their party in the May 17 elections for parliament.

FINDING THE REAL OSCAR WINNERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WESLEY MORRIS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The problem with handicapping the Oscars is that you run the
risk of sounding like Joan or Melissa Rivers. Just standing there
like a fool telling Jeremy Irons he was robbed for his performance
in ``The Silence of the Lambs.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if you're going to do that, there's no place better
than E! _ a letter that could easily stand for ``Eeew,'' especially
when it comes to Oscar coverage. But this year ``eeew'' is an
accurate reaction to some of this year's nominees.
</P>
<P>
   While it's one of the closest recent collections of races _ the
only guarantee is that it will take more than three hours for all
the horses to round the track _ most of the options just seem
staid, safe, conservative.
</P>
<P>
   Five period films about heroism and sacrifice? If there was ever
a year screaming to enact some sort of Oscar affirmative action
policy to shake things up in the best picture category, this would
have been it. (Preferential treatment? Tokenism? String-pulling?
Being bought? Very, very Oscar.)
</P>
<P>
   Of course, on some level, it doesn't really matter how pointedly
inoffensive things get. Who among us is mighty enough to blow off
the whole thing with a flippant ``like I care''? Even with my
anticipation at an all-time low, any show that has the sense of
irony to honor name-naming director Elia Kazan, ``Saving Private
Ryan'' and ``Life Is Beautiful'' in the same year that a black
woman with a Jewish surname is hosting, should be better than
watchable, and at least as interesting, as anything the
mother-and-daughter Rivers have to contribute on the way in.
</P>
<P>
   Kazan's being selected to receive a life achievement Oscar has
so incensed his detractors that they're urging audience members to
sit on their hands when the 89-year-old director _ who was an
informant for the anti-commie House Un-American Affairs Committee
in the 1950s _ takes the stage. Not a bad plan for next time the
Academy expects us to give them props for their craven choices. In
the meantime, here are my takes on what we have to work with this
year:
</P>
<P>
   BEST PICTURE: It's been nominated for so many awards, it seems
to have sucked the suspense out of this year's Oscars. But what
gets lost in all the fawning hype is the fact that ``Saving Private
Ryan'' leaves an indelible impression on the soul. If not the
greatest war film we've ever seen, it's simply the greatest one
we've ever felt. Steven Spielberg has delivered a shattering
you-are-there postcard caked with entrails and earth.
</P>
<P>
   Naysayers groan that the film is just two great battle sequences
with a sentimental soldiers' journey sandwiched in between. But the
film moves from one grueling nightmare to the next guided by an
ambivalent, but steadily unwinding heroism.
</P>
<P>
   So much of the terror the film evokes comes from showing
something we've rarely seen: a hell recently reserved on film for
Vietnam. This will be the closest thing to a unanimous decision
there could be.
</P>
<P>
   Should win: ``Saving Private Ryan''
</P>
<P>
   Will win: ``Saving Private Ryan''
</P>
<P>
   BEST DIRECTOR: Steven Spielberg's commercial instincts have
always been married to his aesthetics, often to a fault, but with
``Saving Private Ryan'' he solidified his status as the most
impassioned commercially viable visionary we have. The fleet of
unshakeable images he crafts, from that armless soldier staggering
in and out of the camera frame to Jeremy Davies' paralyzed corporal
swathed in a belt of bullets weeping on the stairs, redefine the
face of visceral wartime suffering.
</P>
<P>
   Should win: Steven Spielberg
</P>
<P>
   Will win: Steven Spielberg
</P>
<P>
   BEST ACTOR: In the year's tightest race, only Edward Norton's
reformed skinhead seems misplaced, through no fault of his own.
</P>
<P>
   His character's transition from blistering to beatified was
cheated by how poorly structured ``American History X'' was.
</P>
<P>
   What this category comes down to is Tom Hanks' mesmerizing
subtlety, Ian McKellen's ability to de-camp James Whale without
sacrificing both his misery and his libido, and Nick Nolte
uncorking fury like he was playing Bruce Banner. Nolte's best at
playing grizzly bears with eruptive tendencies _ what he does here
is the method equivalent of Chernobyl.
</P>
<P>
   Should win: Nick Nolte
</P>
<P>
   Will win: Nick Nolte
</P>
<P>
   BEST ACTRESS: As the concocted muse of a smitten Will
Shakespeare, Gwyneth Paltrow is a frustrated fairy tale of the
stunning, starry variety the Academy stopped handing Oscars to back
when Julie Christie made black-and-white seem Technicolor in 1965's
``Darling.''
</P>
<P>
   Paltrow throws light all over ``Shakespeare in Love'' like she
didn't know the solar system already had a center. Still: This may
be too frivolous a part for an Oscar nod _ why notice her crocodile
tears and pretend British accent when voters can give the Oscar to
Aussie Cate Blanchett for her two beautiful scenes in a movie where
she otherwise sits there while various backstabbing men tell her
what to do?
</P>
<P>
   But Fernanda Montenegro has the worn look of a former clown too
depressed to even paint her lips, too cynical to smile straight; by
the end of ``Central Station,'' she's earned your heartbreak as the
joy creeps back into her sullen face. It's the performance of the
five that's more human than human should be.
</P>
<P>
   Should win: Fernanda Montenegro
</P>
<P>
   Will win: Cate Blanchett
</P>
<P>
   SUPPORTING ACTOR: Let me see if I get this: If I'm Robert
Duvall, I can get robbed _ lose for my ``Apostle'' performance _
and still show up for a couple weeks to glower at John Travolta,
and I might get another Oscar nomination? And if I'm Ed Harris, all
I have to do to likely win an Oscar is wear a beret and sit at a
console for my entire performance?
</P>
<P>
   Whatever. Ferocity found a first name in James Coburn's bad, bad
dad. And what Billy Bob Thornton does as a wiser-than-he-looks half
of a pair of scheming brothers in ``A Simple Plan'' is so fine and
seemingly effortless you're reluctant to reduce what he's done so
affectingly by calling it acting.
</P>
<P>
   Should win: Billy Bob Thornton
</P>
<P>
   Will win: Ed Harris
</P>
<P>
   SUPPORTING ACTRESS: Judi Dench all but gave an acting class in
``Shakespeare in Love,'' still it's a glorified (glorious) cameo.
</P>
<P>
   Rachel Griffiths has the task of getting sucked into the vortex
of Emily Watson's Jacqueline du Pres; she looks worn out the way a
woman dealing with a volatile, mentally ill genius who wants to
sleep with her husband would be.
</P>
<P>
   But amid the menagerie of phoniness and fakery Mike Nichols
assembled in ``Primary Colors,'' Kathy Bates emerges as the one
true thing. Her bulldozing but vulnerable campaign dustbuster is
one for our times: A woman so disgusted with the immoral state of
the world she has to leave it.
</P>
<P>
   Should win: Kathy Bates
</P>
<P>

   ORIGINAL SCREENPLAY: While Marc Norman and Tom Stoppard's
elaborately cheeky script for ``Shakespeare in Love'' was not the
year's best _ that would be Todd Solondz's ``Happiness'' or Wes
Anderson and Owen Wilson's ``Rushmore'' _ it was the most inspired,
fusing Elizabethan English with anachronistic foolishness. Norman
and Stoppard did something not even Cliff's Notes could: make
accessible fun out of watered-down Shakespeare.

<P>
   Should win: Marc Norman, Tom Stoppard, ``Shakespeare in Love''

<P>
   Will win: ``Shakespeare in Love''
</P>
<P>
   ADAPTED SCREENPLAY: As fluidly and cinematically as Elmore
Leonard's pulp characters speak to one another, his narratives
always seem overweight. In his screenplay for ``Out of Sight,''
Scott Frank cuts away some of the fat from one of Leonard's more
conventional heist books, leaving this taut, intelligent romance
between a lady cop and the robber who kind of wants her to catch
him. But the Academy will take the opportunity to honor Terrence
Malick for making James Jones' difficult tome into a difficult tone
poem of a movie _ more a feat of bravura filmmaking than inventive
screenwriting.

FINDING THE REAL OSCAR WINNERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Refiling for those needing)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WESLEY MORRIS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The problem with handicapping the Oscars is that you run the
risk of sounding like Joan or Melissa Rivers. Just standing there
like a fool telling Jeremy Irons he was robbed for his performance
in ``The Silence of the Lambs.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if you're going to do that, there's no place better
than E! _ a letter that could easily stand for ``Eeew,'' especially
when it comes to Oscar coverage. But this year ``eeew'' is an
accurate reaction to some of this year's nominees.
</P>
<P>
   While it's one of the closest recent collections of races _ the
only guarantee is that it will take more than three hours for all
the horses to round the track _ most of the options just seem
staid, safe, conservative.
</P>
<P>
   Five period films about heroism and sacrifice? If there was ever
a year screaming to enact some sort of Oscar affirmative action
policy to shake things up in the best picture category, this would
have been it. (Preferential treatment? Tokenism? String-pulling?
Being bought? Very, very Oscar.)
</P>
<P>
   Of course, on some level, it doesn't really matter how pointedly
inoffensive things get. Who among us is mighty enough to blow off
the whole thing with a flippant ``like I care''? Even with my
anticipation at an all-time low, any show that has the sense of
irony to honor name-naming director Elia Kazan, ``Saving Private
Ryan'' and ``Life Is Beautiful'' in the same year that a black
woman with a Jewish surname is hosting, should be better than
watchable, and at least as interesting, as anything the
mother-and-daughter Rivers have to contribute on the way in.
</P>
<P>
   Kazan's being selected to receive a life achievement Oscar has
so incensed his detractors that they're urging audience members to
sit on their hands when the 89-year-old director _ who was an
informant for the anti-commie House Un-American Affairs Committee
in the 1950s _ takes the stage. Not a bad plan for next time the
Academy expects us to give them props for their craven choices. In
the meantime, here are my takes on what we have to work with this
year:
</P>
<P>
   BEST PICTURE: It's been nominated for so many awards, it seems
to have sucked the suspense out of this year's Oscars. But what
gets lost in all the fawning hype is the fact that ``Saving Private
Ryan'' leaves an indelible impression on the soul. If not the
greatest war film we've ever seen, it's simply the greatest one
we've ever felt. Steven Spielberg has delivered a shattering
you-are-there postcard caked with entrails and earth.
</P>
<P>
   Naysayers groan that the film is just two great battle sequences
with a sentimental soldiers' journey sandwiched in between. But the
film moves from one grueling nightmare to the next guided by an
ambivalent, but steadily unwinding heroism.
</P>
<P>
   So much of the terror the film evokes comes from showing
something we've rarely seen: a hell recently reserved on film for
Vietnam. This will be the closest thing to a unanimous decision
there could be.
</P>
<P>
   Should win: ``Saving Private Ryan''
</P>
<P>
   Will win: ``Savin Private Ryan''
</P>
<P>
   BEST DIRECTOR: Steven Spielberg's commercial instincts have
always been married to his aesthetics, often to a fault, but with
``Saving Private Ryan'' he solidified his status as the most
impassioned commercially viable visionary we have. The fleet of
unshakeable images he crafts, from that armless soldier staggering
in and out of the camera frame to Jeremy Davies' paralyzed corporal
swathed in a belt of bullets weeping on the stairs, redefine the
face of visceral wartime suffering.
</P>
<P>
   Should win: Steven Spielberg
</P>
<P>
   Will win: Steven Spielberg
</P>
<P>
   BEST ACTOR: In the year's tightest race, only Edward Norton's
reformed skinhead seems misplaced, through no fault of his own.
</P>
<P>
   His character's transition from blistering to beatified was
cheated by how poorly structured ``American History X'' was.
</P>
<P>
   What this category comes down to is Tom Hanks' mesmerizing
subtlety, Ian McKellen's ability to de-camp James Whale without
sacrificing both his misery and his libido, and Nick Nolte
uncorking fury like he was playing Bruce Banner. Nolte's best at
playing grizzly bears with eruptive tendencies _ what he does here
is the method equivalent of Chernobyl.
</P>
<P>
   Should win: Nick Nolte
</P>
<P>
   Will win: Nick Nolte
</P>
<P>
   BEST ACTRESS: As the concocted muse of a smitten Will
Shakespeare, Gwyneth Paltrow is a frustrated fairy tale of the
stunning, starry variety the Academy stopped handing Oscars to back
when Julie Christie made black-and-white seem Technicolor in 1965's
``Darling.''
</P>
<P>
   Paltrow throws light all over ``Shakespeare in Love'' like she
didn't know the solar system already had a center. Still: This may
be too frivolous a part for an Oscar nod _ why notice her crocodile
tears and pretend British accent when voters can give the Oscar to
Aussie Cate Blanchett for her two beautiful scenes in a movie where
she otherwise sits there while various backstabbing men tell her
what to do?
</P>
<P>
   But Fernanda Montenegro has the worn look of a former clown too
depressed to even paint her lips, too cynical to smile straight; by
the end of ``Central Station,'' she's earned your heartbreak as the
joy creeps back into her sullen face. It's the performance of the
five that's more human than human should be.
</P>
<P>
   Should win: Fernanda Montenegro
</P>
<P>
   Will win: Cate Blanchett
</P>
<P>
   (MORE ... MORE)
</P>
<P>
   SUPPORTING ACTOR: Let me see if I get this: If I'm Robert
Duvall, I can get robbed _ lose for my ``Apostle'' performance _
and still show up for a couple weeks to glower at John Travolta,
and I might get another Oscar nomination? And if I'm Ed Harris, all
I have to do to likely win an Oscar is wear a beret and sit at a
console for my entire performance?
</P>
<P>
   Whatever. Ferocity found a first name in James Coburn's bad, bad
dad. And what Billy Bob Thornton does as a wiser-than-he-looks half
of a pair of scheming brothers in ``A Simple Plan'' is so fine and
seemingly effortless you're reluctant to reduce what he's done so
affectingly by calling it acting.
</P>
<P>
   Should win: Billy Bob Thornton
</P>
<P>
   Will win: Ed Harris
</P>
<P>
   SUPPORTING ACTRESS: Judi Dench all but gave an acting class in
``Shakespeare in Love,'' still it's a glorified (glorious) cameo.
</P>
<P>
   Rachel Griffiths has the task of getting sucked into the vortex
of Emily Watson's Jacqueline du Pres; she looks worn out the way a
woman dealing with a volatile, mentally ill genius who wants to
sleep with her husband would be.
</P>
<P>
   But amid the menagerie of phoniness and fakery Mike Nichols
assembled in ``Primary Colors,'' Kathy Bates emerges as the one
true thing. Her bulldozing but vulnerable campaign dustbuster is
one for our times: A woman so disgusted with the immoral state of
the world she has to leave it.
</P>
<P>
   Should win: Kathy Bates
</P>
<P>
   Will win: Kathy Bates
</P>

WHAT WE TRULY NEED IS A RIGHT TO AN EXIT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Once upon a time, when commercial air travel was an outrageously
expensive luxury and a delightful relief from the drudgery of
driving, people who avoided airplanes most often were folks who
couldn't afford the price of a ticket and those who suffered from a
fear of flying.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, just about everyone can afford some sort of airfare,
and safety statistics suggest that a jetliner is far less hazardous
to life and limb than an automobile.
</P>
<P>
   There are people who want no part of air travel, however, and
the reason is not that they are afraid of flying. The reason is
that they are afraid of ``not flying.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's travelers fear being forced to camp out in airport
terminals because flights are delayed or canceled because of
problems ranging from bad weather to labor disputes. Today's
travelers fear being imprisoned for hours on planes that either
can't take off or can't land because of overcrowded runways and/or
lousy planning by airports and airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Today's air travelers fear being abused, ignored, insulted and
patronized by an air travel industry that all too often seems to
care nothing for its customers once they have forked over their
hard-earned bucks for a ticket that may or may not guarantee that
they will reach their intended destination at the intended time.
</P>
<P>
   The collective patience of airline passengers finally neared the
breaking point in January when a horrendous snowstorm in Detroit
prompted Northwest Airlines to treat customers as hostages,
confining passengers for hours on end aboard grounded airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   The result? You guessed it: The politicians saw a parade forming
and immediately sprinted to the front in hopes of creating the
illusion that they are leading it.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Congress and the Clinton administration, in fact, are
tripping over one another as they rush to unveil assorted versions
of a ``bill of rights'' for air passengers. There's a bill in the
Senate and a bill in the House, and Vice President Al
``Program-a-Day'' Gore announced a third initiative designed ``to
ensure that airline consumers are treated fairly before, during and
after a flight.''
</P>
<P>
   The various proposals may differ in the specific details, but
the main thrust of each is to provide air travelers with more
information. If the airline honchos decide to strand you on a
runway for nine hours, in other words, they would be required to
tell you why. If they decide to dump you off to another airline for
part of your trip, they would be required to warn you ahead of
time.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, yeah, and if they bump you from a scheduled flight or lose
your luggage, they would have to pay you more for your trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing wrong with any of that. The more information a traveler
can get, the better. And money is good.
</P>
<P>
   But there's one gigantic hole in all these proposals: None of
them would prohibit an airline from holding you on a plane against
your will.
</P>
<P>
   None of the proposals would give a passenger the right to rise
from his seat after being trapped for hours and say: ``I want off
this %!! airplane, and I want off now!''
</P>
<P>
   Well, actually, you probably have the right to say that even
now. You just don't have the right to enforce it _ and you wouldn't
have the right to enforce it under any of the passenger ``bill of
rights'' plans on the table.
</P>
<P>
   According to a spokesman for the House Transportation and
Infrastructure Committee _ where one of the plans is working its
way through the legislative obstacle course _ it is possible that
the right to deplane could be added at some point. The legislation
is ``a work in progress,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The airlines have their reasons for imprisoning passengers on
stranded planes _ safety is a factor, a spokesman for Gore
suggested _ but any problem can be solved with sufficient effort.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers need more information. Rescuing lost luggage is
important.
</P>
<P>
   But if the politicians truly care about passenger rights, they
should figure out a way to rescue travelers from parked airplanes.

GREENSPAN WOWS BANKERS, AND RIGHTLY SO 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EDWARD IWATA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Cult of Greenspan descended on San
Francisco. Attired in suits and golf slacks, the Fedheads and
groupies _ thousands of bankers in town for a conference _ filled
Moscone Center for a fleeting glimpse of The Man.
</P>
<P>
   It takes a lot to get a rise from bankers. Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan did it Tuesday with a shy grin and a
half-hour of dull speech.
</P>
<P>
   If power is a turn-on, Greenspan is a sex god. If economics is a
dismal science, he's the Chief Dismal Scientist. Time magazine
wrote he has ``shaman-like power over the global economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Others call him the second mightiest man on the planet (next to
the president). I don't doubt it for a second. I saw his charm,
felt his allure. I stood next to misty-eyed bankers at a banking
conference Tuesday at the Moscone Center in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Balding and bespectacled at 73, the soft-spoken Greenspan
commands the room like a televangelist.
</P>
<P>
   Before his talk, a military color guard and rousing marching
music revved up the bankers. A mass prayer got them into a beatific
mood. Praised as a man of ``undisputed greatness'' who has led us
to ``the promised land of economic growth,'' Greenspan strode to
the dais and a long standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   After droning about the farm economy, Greenspan scampered from
the hall, tailed by autograph hounds. One waved a pen and paper,
hoping to snag the Omnipotent One.
</P>
<P>
   The fan was Stanley Carlson, head of the Washington Federal
Savings Bank in Washington, Iowa. He said he and his colleagues
crowded around the television when Greenspan spoke, devouring each
word, each grin or grimace.
</P>
<P>
   ``The man is a master of the economy,'' gushed Carlson. ``We
won't truly understand how great he was until 20 years from now,
when historians look back at his record.''
</P>
<P>
   Why does Greenspan have such star power?
</P>
<P>
   Probably because he's steered the nation through a golden
economic era. Corporate profits and stocks have hit all-time highs.
The economy still is growing. Inflation has been whipped, and
unemployment is at a 28-year low. He's the right man for the right
time.
</P>
<P>
   A child of the Depression, Greenspan is a monetary wizard. He
cuts interest rates here, raises them there. He pumps cash into the
economy, or siphons the cash back. His goal: a stable economy. His
fine-tuned balancing act keeps everyone _ politicians, financiers,
investors, consumers _ happy and healthy.
</P>
<P>
   He's also the ultimate political animal. Over the decades, he's
thrived as an economic adviser and Fed chair under five presidents:
Nixon, Ford, Reagan, Bush and Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In social settings, Greenspan loosens up a bit. He hops from
soiree to soiree in Washington with his wife, NBC broadcaster
Andrea Mitchell. A lover of jazz and classical music, he played sax
in a swing band during his youth.
</P>
<P>
   But on fiscal matters, he's super-cautious, a Yoda of
meaningless verbiage. Money experts have gone mad trying to decode
his nebulous remarks. He's a poker-faced cipher, revealing nothing
that might shake the markets.
</P>
<P>
   In a private meeting Tuesday with bankers, he dodged queries
about the Dow's flirting with 10,000. ``Do you want to comment?''
he was asked. ``No,'' was all he said.
</P>
<P>
   He should lighten up a bit. What's going on behind those
horn-rimmed glasses, that sheepish smile?
</P>
<P>
   Before Greenspan steps down, he should do something wild. Bash
some bankers. Slam the stock market. Raise interest rates and wreak
global havoc. Remember the famous John Maynard Keynes adage: ``In
the long run, we are all dead.''

   CIR-HATE-SITES (Undated) _ At first glance, Nole's Page looks
like any one of the thousands of personal home pages digitally
dashed upon the Internet by adolescents with a modicum of computer
skills and a hankering to be noticed. The page claims to be all
about Santa Barbara, Calif., but scrolling down, past the blast of
rock power chords, visitors to the page will soon discover after
reading a brief passage that the Web site is actually devoted to
``white power.'' Nole's Page turns out to be a neo-Nazi rant
peppered with glowing references to skinhead ideology. This site
and others like it are liste on Digital Hate 2000, an interactive
report on CD-ROM from the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles.
The report is a guided tour of what Rabbi Abraham Cooper, associate
dean of the center, characterized as an explosive growing
subculture of hate on the Internet. ``Racist hate organizations are
learning how to use this new electronic media,'' said David
Goldman, director of Hate Watch, a volunteer Internet group that
has been tracking hate speech on the Internet for five years. By

(EDS: The second part of a two-part report) 
FIGHTING TO CHANGE A CHAUVINISTIC SOCIETY (For use by NYTimes News
Service clients) 
By TIM MADIGAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CIUDAD JUAREZ, Mexico _ In 20 years as an investigative
journalist, Brian Barger had exposed misdeeds of Oliver North in
the Iran-Contra scandal, uncovered a CIA assassination manual, and
taken on Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega.
</P>
<P>
   Then, last April, his life and career would take an abrupt and
surprising turn. He was dispatched to Juarez by the Cable News
Network to cover the murders of scores of poor young women and the
specter of a serial killer. What he found profoundly moved him: a
community so grief-stricken, desperate and chauvinistic that it
shredded his journalistic reserve. After a week of reporting in
Mexico, Barger asked to be removed from the story.
</P>
<P>
   It was then that Barger's real involvement with the story of
Juarez began. He spent much of the next year working on his own
time to create a rape crisis center in Juarez, an idea that came to
him on his first reporting trip. Barger resigned from CNN in
January to found the International Trauma Research Center, an
organization to assist victims of trauma across the developing
world. Both his bosses and his friends wonder if he's crazy.
</P>
<P>
   Barger, 46, who is single but has a daughter in college, only
chuckles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have found immense gratification in being able to go beyond
simply telling a story and actually lending a hand to people in
need.''
</P>
<P>
   The doggedness required for investigative reporting has come in
handy. Through his lobbying, Juarez Mayor Gustavo Elizondo agreed
to pay the rent and three salaries for the new rape crisis center.
At Barger's urging, the Texas attorney general's office agreed to
help train Juarez rape crisis volunteers. Barger helped secure a
$25,000 grant from a foundation in neighboring El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   Then on a sunny Saturday morning last month, Barger joined
relatives of the slain women, leading Juarez feminists, business
leaders, and government officials from Mexico and Texas to christen
Casa Amiga, or Friend's House. The spacious 1-story building on a
quiet street near downtown Juarez is only the fourth rape crisis
center in Mexico, the first in a Mexican border city.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gave us the opportunity to talk about basic things,'' says
Barger. ``It's not OK to engage in domestic violence. It's not OK
to rape your wife. It's not OK to commit incest. It was a message
that echoed across Juarez.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Esther Chavez brandished a copy of that day's newspaper like a
club, pacing behind her desk at Casa Amiga.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am angry about this,'' said Chavez, Juarez's leading
feminist and Casa Amiga's first executive director. ``I want to
fight with this man. I'm going to write a terrible letter.''
</P>
<P>
   Her pique was directed toward Arturo Gonzalez Rascon, attorney
general of the state of Chihuahua. Speaking to reporters in Juarez
about the slayings of young women, likely the work of one or more
serial killers, Rascon seemed to suggest that the victims were at
least in part to blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of their life conditions, the places where they go
about their life, they are at risk,'' Rascon was quoted as saying.
``It would be very difficult for someone to go out in the street
when it's raining. ... It would be very hard not to get wet.''
</P>
<P>
   Chavez was almost spitting behind her desk.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not an attorney general,'' Chavez said. ``He talks like
an old priest. He has to respect women. He's stupid, and I'm going
to tell him.''
</P>
<P>
   But something in her eyes suggested that the petite, red-haired
woman relished the fight. She had moved to Juarez in 1982 after 20
years as a successful businesswoman in Mexico City. On arriving
here, she felt a tug toward humanitarian concerns in the troubled
city.
</P>
<P>
   But not until 1992, when the state proposed outlawing abortion,
was Chavez finally prompted to action. Chavez, a single woman now
in her 60s, has been fighting ever since.

CIUDAD JUAREZ, Mexico: ever since. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   She organized a women's group that lobbied for, among other
things, tougher penalties for sexual assault. She began writing a
column on women's issues for a Juarez newspaper. She compiled what
many believe is the most accurate and comprehensive list of the
female murder victims. In 1996, she helped create a coalition of 18
women's groups to pressure law enforcement, which the women accused
of being incompetent and indifferent to the killings.
</P>
<P>
   When Barger met Chavez last year, she seemed a natural to head
the rape crisis center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to fight very, very hard to alter the society, to get
the same rights as men,'' she says at her desk, which is adorned by
a framed photograph of her and Barger, both of them smiling broadly
in a happy moment. ``We are going step by step by step.''
</P>
<P>
   Chavez concedes that in Mexico, it will be a very long journey.
To her, Rascon's comments are symptomatic of deeply ingrained
chauvinism afflicting Mexican society. Another indicator: In
Mexico, maximum punishment for the most serious sexual assaults is
only 15 years in prison _ compared with life behind bars in Texas.
Because of societal taboos, victimized Mexican women, even more so
than rape victims in the United States, are unlikely to report the
crimes or seek help.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our culture says that rape should be kept in the house,''
Chavez says. ``It is not good to go public. The clothing is washed
at home. That is a problem, no?
</P>
<P>
   ``Marital rape is considered a right of the man, and when some
women decide to go to police, she receives another rape because the
police and the doctors think that she's guilty, that she goes to
some places and dresses a certain way.''
</P>
<P>
   Prevailing societal attitudes exacerbate an already perilous
situation for women here, feminist leaders say. The combination of
alcohol and the cramped one-room huts that tens of thousands live
in contributes to an epidemic of incest and family violence. In a
city bustling with hundreds of foreign-owned factories, called
``maquiladoras,'' thousands of vulnerable young women find
themselves on the streets, making their way to and from work. Most
of the victims of what police call sexual homicides _ women who in
the last several years have been snatched away into the desert,
raped and tortured _ have worked for ``maquiladoras,'' local
journalists say.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of other women who survive their sexual attacks need
professional help, feminist leaders say, but only a small
percentage will receive it. For Chavez, at the end of another
15-hour day, the problems can seem overwhelming. One recent night
at Casa Amiga, as she spoke about the Mexican poverty, chauvinism
and the killings, her weary sighs echoed in the empty building,
which had yet to begin 24-hour operation.
</P>
<P>
   Then came a rapping at the front door. It was a woman who said
her 8-year-old daughter had been raped by a neighbor. The police
had questioned the man, but released him for lack of evidence. Yet
the mother said she had learned her daughter's attacker had a
history of sexual violence in El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez spoke to the woman for several minutes, making an
appointment to see her in the morning. When she returned to her
desk, the weariness was gone. The neighborhood must know of this
man, she said. Maybe women's groups could demonstrate near his
home. Another fight loomed.

SIGNING ON WITH YOUR FINGERPRINTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By PETER WAYNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   While people continue to repeat the New Yorker cartoon tag line
that no one knows you're a dog on the Internet, the computer
industry is working diligently to sort out the sheep from the
goats.
</P>
<P>
   Anonymity may offer a bit of excitement to chat rooms and keep
us safe from stalkers we meet on line, but careful industries like
banks and investment houses continue to look for better technology
for identifying people. Some of the latest solutions on the horizon
are devices for reading people's fingerprints.
</P>
<P>
   A number of companies are making relatively inexpensive gadgets
that can capture an image of a fingerprint so that it can be
compared against a database. They are not in widespread use yet,
but biometrics, the term for using bodily features as
identification, is a field that is prompting a lot of interest and
a number of companies have hopes that the fingerprint scanners will
take off.
</P>
<P>
   American Biometric, a Canadian-based concern, offers a device
called a BioMouse for about $250 that reads fingerprints into a PC
and compares them with a database. Sony is also shipping similar
devices and the California based company I/O Software is selling
them packaged with its SecureSuite software at a price of around
$350.
</P>
<P>
   While these might be a bit too expensive to make it into every
PC, they're priced low enough for some business applications. Among
the places fingerprint scanners might be used are bank teller
windows or time clocks.
</P>
<P>
   Each of these devices takes an image of a fingerprint and
converts it into a relatively small file known as a template. This
records the locations of the unique parts of each fingerprint:
whorls, arches, ridges, valleys and loops. Fingerprints can be
compared and matched by looking at these locations.
</P>
<P>
   But keeping fingerprints on file worries privacy advocates,
because such information can be susceptible to abuse. While bank
customers may use different passwords on different accounts, for
example, their fingerprints remain the same. An unscrupulous
programmer at a bank could easily use data records to impersonate a
client.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fingerprint identification raises the difficult tension
between security and privacy,'' said Marc Rotenberg of the
Electronic Privacy Information Center. ``Security gives more
authentication and that's good because it means that the person
using an ATM is who they say they are. But on the privacy side we
create the risk of a new global identifier.''
</P>
<P>
   Both American Biometric's device and the package produced by
Sony and I/O Software come with a touch-sensitive screen that
reacts to a finger. The amount of pressure makes a big difference
in producing a machine-recognizable image, and it took me several
tries before I was able to do so consistently.
</P>
<P>
   It is also important to place the finger in the same position
each time an image is taken, because small shifts can make a big
difference in which features appear. If the machine can't find the
right whorls and loops, it won't recognize you.
</P>
<P>
   Both packages also come with some software that adds security to
a computer. I/O Software's SecureSuite package includes a tool that
lets the user log into a computer by checking the fingerprint.
While it took several tries to successfully program the system with
my fingerprint, it worked fairly well afterwards.
</P>
<P>
   The true effectiveness of these devices is hard to judge.
Stealing passwords is relatively easy to do, hard to defend
against, and difficult to detect when the password is taken.
Fingerprints, on the other hand, can't be stolen by looking over
someone's shoulder, but they can be found on water glasses and
other smooth-surfaced objects.
</P>
<P>
   Both products try to screen out forgeries. Both have
touch-sensitive screens that can detect dry-paper pictures of
fingerprints. Neither would accept a laser-printed version of my
right thumb print, even after I added some moisture to activate the
touch-sensitive screens.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Borza, a vice-president of American Biometric, says that
the only consistently successful way to fool the reader that has
been demonstrated in the company's labs has been by using a plaster
cast of a finger. Most latent finger prints left in everyday use,
he says, are smudged by tiny rotations of the moving fingers.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers who try to use a copy of a fingerprint picked up
from a wine glass, a car door or a fingerprint file run into
trouble. Even printcards taken at police stations are often
distorted.
</P>
<P>
   The company is also selling a product known as the BioMouse Plus
which comes with a built-in reader for smartcards, identification
card often used for security. Borza says, ``You essentially need
the smartcard and the finger. It's a two-factor authentication.
Just having a `severed digit' isn't going to get you in.''
</P>
<P>
   He may have been referring to a favorite, apparently apocryphal,
story among security people about the mugger, who, faced with an
ATM that used fingerprint-identification security technology,
simply chopped off his victim's finger.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Schneier, the president of the computer security firm,
Counterpane, says, ``Biometrics are secure if you have an armed
guard watching the biometric reader; otherwise it can be fooled.''
For example, they may work at a bank teller's window, but couldn't
be trusted if installed on a home PC.
</P>
<P>
   He points out that all biometric devices are susceptible to a
``replay attack'' if an intruder is able to make a copy of the
description of the legitimate user's body part.
</P>
<P>
   This description is not supposed to change over time, so the
intruder may be able to get the system to replay it. This would
require some access to the software or the network connection,
however, making home PCs much more vulnerable than installations at
banks.
</P>
<P>
   Borza argues that endless cycles of counter-engineering and
counter-counter-engineering for security purposes have diminishing
returns. Citing the classic Mad magazine comic strip, he says, ``At
some level it becomes `Spy vs. Spy' and it's hard to justify it.'''

DALLAS: step right up. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We met on the patio of Ziziki at lunch time. Torres, much to the
confusion of the waitress, asked for a pastis, or a Ricard.
</P>
<P>
   We ordered salads, and I leaned back in the wrought-iron chair,
waiting for a sort of silliness that never came.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Torres said he was tense, and that he's always tense
before a class, or before he tapes his show.
</P>
<P>
   Torres talked about his apprenticeship at 15 in a bakery in his
hometown of Bandol, and how on a bet, at about age 20, he walked
into the exclusive Hotel Negresco in Nice one day and somehow found
his way into the office of the world-famous chef, Jacques Maximin,
whom he asked for a job.
</P>
<P>
   He got it. And stayed for eight years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone after that said, `How did you get in?' '' Torres
said. ``They have a waiting list. You have to write letters. You
have to have recommendations. It's impossible to get in. It was
pure luck.''
</P>
<P>
   Torres told me how he won, at 26, his country's prestigious
Meilleur Ouvrier competition, becoming the youngest pastry chef to
receive the honor. (''I didn't even invite my parents to the
ceremony. I didn't think I would win.'') In 1988, he became
corporate pastry chef of the Ritz Carlton Hotel Co. and then in
1989, accepted owner Sirio Maccioni's offer and became the pastry
chef at Le Cirque restaurant. In 1996, Le Cirque closed, reopening
the next year as Le Cirque 2000 in the New York Palace Hotel with a
million-dollar pastry kitchen built to Torres' specifications.
</P>
<P>
   It's in that kitchen that Torres still works, six days _ and
nights _ a week, he said, serving about 800 people every 24 hours.
He and his assistants also make about 100 12-piece boxes of
chocolates daily for the special guests of the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Torres also teaches once a week at the French Culinary
Institute, where he is dean of pastry arts; tapes his PBS show in
the fall; writes the cookbooks to accompany the show; and travels
throughout the year to promote both of the latter. He's in a
different city about once every other week, never spending the
night, because he has to be back in the kitchen the next day to
stand and stand, and create.
</P>
<P>
   I was tired just thinking about a life of such intensity, but
Torres was ready to roll.
</P>
<P>
   We hurried across the street to Sur La Table, where Torres
greeted a roomful of professional chefs ready to watch his
demonstrations on chocolate and sugar. For 2 1/2 hours, Torres
molded chocolate into curves and boxes, and poured the hot liquid
on unlikely surfaces _ bubble wrap, a fly swatter _ to create
texture.
</P>
<P>
   In a pot, he combined white vinegar, water and sugar, and boiled
it. He picked up the resulting mixture and began pulling it,
stretching it, folding it back on itself and pulling again,
creating an increasingly shiny matter that he then separated into
sections, coloring them red, blue and green. The crowd grew silent
as Torres put on his sugar show, transforming the blobs into a
colorful clown statue, a graceful flower blossom and a billowing,
striped ribbon sculpted into a 10-inch bow. While he worked, he
joked, telling stories like the one about a client who requested a
special sugar sculpture. ``The lady had her, how you say,
`poitrine' enlarged'' and wanted an anatomical sugar model to
celebrate the breast augmentation.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd burst into laughter, and in the spotlight, as the
class concluded, Torres was laughing, enjoying the moment in full.
</P>
<P>
   But the show was far from over. In less than half an hour,
Torres would be doing it all over again for another eager group,
beginning with a ladyfinger cake this time. He'd be at Sur La Table
for four more hours, minimum, and when he was done, he would pack
up and take his personal big top back to New York for another long
day of performances in the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   And Torres, the ringmaster, had it all under control.
</P>

LE CIRQUE 2000 PASTRY MASTER JACQUES TORRES IS WHIRLWIND OF
ACTIVITY
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanied by PASTRIES-RECIPES) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CATHERINE NEWTON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The demonstration room at Sur La Table, the West
Coast-based, stock-your-chic-kitchen shop that recently spread its
gastronomic roots to Dallas, is packed. And loud.
</P>
<P>
   The audience eagerly clutches spoons and forks in anticipation
of the sweet treats ahead. Green-aproned employees drag in
additional chairs for the spillover crowd, many clutching Jacques
Torres' new cookbook, ``Dessert Circus at Home'' (William Morrow,
$28). At the front of the room, Torres, executive pastry chef at
New York's Le Cirque 2000 restaurant, is carefully matching a list
of supplies _ strawberries, grated chocolate, cake ring, piles and
piles of sugar _ with what he finds on the marble counter beside a
sugar-sculpted clown and a foot-high, glossy chocolate sculpture.
Behind Torres, four white-jacketed assistants scurry about,
prepping, prepping, prepping.
</P>
<P>
   The clock hits 6 and the show begins, with Torres launching into
his first creation _ a strawberry ladyfinger cake _ and delivering
the sort of animated play-by-play that he developed for his PBS
cooking show, now in its second season. Torres begins generously
pouring Stoli Strasberi vodka into the mixture, which prompts
chuckling from the crowd _ and a story from him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did one show for PBS,'' he says, interrupting his frenetic
activity. ``Jacques Pepin (fellow PBS chef and friend) was in it.
We drank that stuff during the show. They removed the show from
television.'' He breaks into a so-you-caught-me grin. ``It was too
crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Crazy'' is a word often linked with the Provence native, who
tends to launch Silly String and egg attacks on the dessert
devotees who come to watch him perform. (Most of the time, the eggs
are fake; it was only that one show, really, he swears, where he
made the mistake.)
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was fate that a decade ago brought Torres the
chef-cum-entertainer to the four-star Manhattan restaurant with the
name that means, in English, ``The Circus.'' Creating
fanciful-verging-on-magical signature desserts, such as the clown
hat and the chocolate moose, Torres has often said that he's
``toujours'' the clown of the place.
</P>
<P>
   But the thing is, I don't believe it.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   This spring-kissed day in Dallas that Torres says reminds him of
the Riviera (''except it's so flat here, what do you do?'') is the
first time I've met Torres.
</P>
<P>
   And somehow, meeting him almost seemed redundant.
</P>
<P>
   My first taste of Torres came about five years ago, at my
parents' house one Christmas, in the form of an embarrassing
abundance of chocolates made by my brother-in-law, John.
</P>
<P>
   A shy and serious fellow who spends his days managing people's
investments, John shocked us when he unveiled the delights, dubbed
them his Small Presentations and then proceeded to carry on about
some chocolate-making class he'd been taking on Saturdays from a
gastronomic guru at New York's French Culinary Institute. In truth,
I didn't listen for the details. I just ate.
</P>
<P>
   Rice Krispies coated in white chocolate and milk chocolate.
Caramelized almonds coated with chocolate and rolled in cocoa.
Truffles.
</P>
<P>
   The Small Presentations made their way to the table each year,
but did not associate themselves, at least in my mind, with the
Torres name until 1997. That year, as a gift, John and my sister
Laura gave me a signed copy of Torres' cookbook, ``Dessert
Circus,'' which thanked them in the credits, Laura explained,
because they had attended every single taping of the 26-episode
first season of Torres' PBS show.
</P>
<P>
   They seemed a little out of control, I thought. And then it got
worse.
</P>
<P>
   The Torres circus train swept Laura and John along on its
fast-moving ride. John took a week off from his job in 1997 simply
to spend time with Torres in the kitchen at Le Cirque 2000, where
he could watch the master at work. Arriving at 7 or 8 a.m. and
finishing up about 9 each night, he found the work ``punishing
physically'' and requiring ``severe foot care.'' Still, he went
back for another week in the summer of '98 to learn more about
Torres' theories and the chemistry of gourmet desserts. When John
and Laura moved to California, they flew back to New York to catch
some tapings for the second season of Torres' show. At Christmas, I
got another signed cookbook, and felt the rumble of the train.
</P>
<P>
   In February, my sister spent two hours one night telling me
about the souffle Torres had invented that does not fall and about
his miniature chocolate stoves that cover pieces of hazelnut cake
and that have little tiny chocolate pots bearing fruit sauces to be
poured over the cake before consumption.
</P>
<P>
   I had to know what was making my family members so, well, crazy.
</P>
<P>
   So when I heard the Torres circus was coming to town, I had to
step right up.

AD CAMPAIGN EMPHASIZING GOD KICKS OFF IN DALLAS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARY DOCLAR 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ It's not exactly a bolt of lightning or a burning bush.
</P>
<P>
   But if the new ``God speaking'' billboard campaign can at least
get people thinking about the Almighty instead of topless joints or
cold brews, then its supporters will consider it a success.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you take a look at what's happening in our society today,
it's not a pretty sight,'' said Andy Smith, president of the Fort
Lauderdale-based advertising agency that developed the campaign
last year at the request of an anonymous client. ``It's time to get
people to start thinking about God and the rules God set forth.''
</P>
<P>
   The nationwide program is being kicked off in Dallas with more
than 120 billboards and will eventually spread to 10,000 locations
in 200 U.S. markets. The program features stark black billboards
with white-lettered messages signed simply by ``God.''
</P>
<P>
   One billboard appears to chastise motorists: ``Keep using my
name in vain. I'll make rush hour longer.'' Another entreats
married couples: ``Loved the wedding, invite me to the marriage.''
A third message urges: ``Follow me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. William Carl III, pastor of First Presbyterian Church
of Dallas, said he liked the billboards so much that he decided to
mention them in a sermon several weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're more teasers than they are the real big
message,'' said Carl, whose church has about 1,700 members.
``They're teasers to get you into the church or synagogue or
whatever. Then you get the deeper message.''
</P>
<P>
   But a Southern Methodist University professor who specializes in
modern religion and culture doubts whether the 18 nondenominational
messages will make much of an impression on cynical Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in a society where everything is sold by clever
advertising, so it's not surprising that religion would try its
hand at this,'' said Lonnie Kliever, chairman of the religious
studies department at SMU. ``But to think that this is somehow
going to spark a kind of national revival of God consciousness or
return to the church, I think that's pretty naive, theologically.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the Dallas Outdoor Advertising Association, which
is donating $100,000 in billboard space for the 1999 campaign,
believes that the program can make a difference. The organization
was so enthusiastic that the Outdoor Advertising Association of
America decided to start the public-service campaign in Dallas,
Nancy Fletcher, president of the Outdoor Advertising Association of
America, said during a news conference Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign was developed in Florida last year at the request
of an anonymous Floridian who Smith said wanted to prompt people to
start thinking about God. Publicity about that initial effort
caught the attention of the national advertising group.
</P>
<P>
   Fletcher described the billboard messages, which involve the
donation of $15 million in billboard space nationally, as ``a
modern interpretation of the Ten Commandments.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at the campaign as an inspiration to get someone to be
thinking about their own spirituality,'' she said of the
billboards, which are also up in Fort Worth and Arlington and will
spread to more area locations this summer.
</P>
<P>
   For those who think it's a bit presumptuous for an advertising
agency to think it can speak for God, Smith said that most
Americans will accept the spirit in which the messages are offered.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel it was done in such a clever, reverent, humorous way
that people will understand the meaning behind them,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   We're all about cucumbers this week.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Baxter e-mails looking for a cucumber salad dressing. And
right after that, another e-mail arrives, from Brenda McPhail, who
is looking for a recipe for cucumber sandwiches, the very proper
British tea goody. Here are those recipes, plus one for cucumber
soup as a bonus. It's a little nippy for the soup right now, but it
will be most welcome when July hits.
</P>
<P>
   CUCUMBER-DILL DRESSING
</P>
<P>
   Yields 1/2 cup
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup chopped cucumber (cucumber should be peeled and seeded,
or just peeled if an English cucumber is used, see Note)
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons low-fat plain yogurt
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon minced garlic
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon sugar
</P>
<P>
   Dash white pepper, or to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon fresh dill (or 1/2 teaspoon dried dill weed)
</P>
<P>
   Note: English cucumbers (they're the long, cellophane-wrapped
cucumbers in the produce section) have thinner skins and fewer
seeds than standard cucumbers.
</P>
<P>
   Place all ingredients, except dill, in a blender. Puree until
smooth. Stir in dill. Taste; adjust seasonings. Chill. Stir before
serving.
</P>
<P>
   If using dried dill, allow dressing to stand for 15-30 minutes
before serving. With either form of dill, it's good to chill the
dressing before serving. This dressing will keep for up to 2 days
in a tightly closed container in the refrigerator.

<P>
   Parsley sprigs
</P>
<P>
   Note: Pepperidge Farm's ``thin sliced'' is good for these
sandwiches because it's a denser-than-normal bread.
</P>
<P>
   Lay cucumber slices on plate and sprinkle with vinegar. Cover
and set aside for 30 minutes. Then drain in a sieve or colander to
remove excess liquid. Butter slices of bread. Cover a slice of
bread with slices of drained cucumber, top with another slice of
bread and press firmly together. Cut off crust and cut each
sandwich into triangles or fingers. Arrange on serving plate and
garnish with sprigs of parsley.

   Pooh Bear's cupboards can hardly be bare these days. It seems
that just about every category in the grocery store has some
product that is honey-enhanced.

<P>
   There are King's Hawaiian Honey &AMP; Wheat Rolls, Mrs Baird's Honey

Dijon Dressing in the produce section. Underwood packages a Honey
Ham Spread; the snack section sells Planters Honey Roasted Peanuts
and Snyder's of Hanover Tangy Honey Mustard Dip.

   The National Honey Board (the promotion organ of honey producers

its studies, an average of 20 new products including honey are
introduced every month. In 1970, Americans consumed 243 million
pounds of honey. In 1993, we consumed 313 million pounds.

<P>
   From hair care to a Long Island company that uses honey in pet

   ``The whole natural thing really appeals to consumers,'' says
Gretchen Lichtenwalner, the Honey Board's marketing director.
</P>
<P>
   In an era when companies are jumping to create ``added-value''
foods (adding calcium to pasta, echinacea to orange juice), it's
even more natural to go with nature's own sweetener.
</P>
<P>
   Honey does include trace amounts of vitamins, minerals and
all-the-vogue antioxidants. But what might make honey the sleeper
of the natural-food world is a current study at the University of
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   A scientist there is finally examining the long-rumored but
never-tested theory of whether eating locally produced honey will
help allergy sufferers assailed by grasses and weeds. If so, this
ancient treat could be one of the next millennium's silver bullets.

THEY'VE GOT MAIL, AND GAME; CHESS FANS MAKE THEIR MOVE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ore.)   (af)  
 By J.D. BIERSDORFER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   While slick online games like Baldur's Gate and Half-Life are
attracting plenty of players with their intense action and glorious
graphics, there is another group of gamers on the Internet that is
just as passionate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chess game anyone? If you would like to play, I am white and
my first move is 1. e4,'' reads a posting in one of the Usenet
chess newsgroups. In fact, Usenet, the worldwide bulletin board
system, has a forum called rec.games.chess.play-by-email that is
devoted to long-distance competitions. No longer do players have to
rely on the post office and mailing lists to take on faraway
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a serious chess player, but I play a decent game if
I'm not rushed,'' Chris Cooper of Silverton, Ore., said via e-mail.
``e-mail seemed to be the way to go. Spending 20 to 33 cents a
postcard or letter per chess move does not make any sense to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Working on one's endgame by e-mail is nothing new. But now
chess-heads can get a bit more graphic than sending a message that
reads ``1. Ng1-f3.'' With Hasbro Interactive's Grand Master Chess
program, (which also includes checkers and backgammon), a player
can send, via e-mail, an animated color chessboard to an opponent
that displays that kingside knight making his first move.
</P>
<P>
   The game is part of Hasbro's e-mail Games series of CD-ROMs,
which also include two other board-game staples, Battleship and
Scrabble. The company plans to release more games in the series
this spring, including football, golf and poker.
</P>
<P>
   E-mail Battleship comes with explosive noises and digitized
fireballs that appear on the game-board grid when you score a hit
on the enemy fleet. Scrabble's distinctive letter tiles move just
as easily on screen, and having them in digital form relieves the
secret fear (especially for parents) of losing all the vowels under
the couch over the years.
</P>
<P>
   To participate in the games, a player needs to be running
Windows 95 or 98, have Internet access and run an e-mail program
that allows the sending and receiving of file attachments. Only the
player initiating the game needs to have the CD-ROM.
</P>
<P>
   Player 1 starts a game and sends the first move to Player 2. The
e-mail is routed through Hasbro's game server, and it takes about
five minutes for each move to go from Player 1 to Player 2. Player
2 gets the e-mail message and clicks on the attachment to download
and install the game. Then Player 2 can make a move, write a
message and send the game back to Player 1.
</P>
<P>
   Each title in Hasbro Interactive's e-mail Games series costs
$14.95, and all are available for purchase on line at
www.emailgames.com or in retail stores. People who want to try
before they buy can download a free 10-move game demo from the Web
site.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say it is pretty good,'' Cooper said of Hasbro's chess
game. ``I like not having to read chess notation. Now I have a
reason to look forward to my e-mail.''
</P>
<P>
   The e-mail games seem to be gaining popularity. Although the
games have been out for only a few months, there is already a fan
Web page devoted to them: Bill &AMP; John's e-mail Games Player's
Directory at pages.prodigy.net/n2netsurfn/pbem.

OUT OF THE FRYING PAN AND INTO THE DESKTOP

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I'm not a Luddite, really. I enjoy using computers, and even own
two of them. But when it comes to CD-ROM cookbooks, I still need
persuading.
</P>
<P>
   You will understand my bias if you consider this: suppose you
have carried home your new $30 hardcover copy of ``Joy of
Cooking,'' and you have opened it to the recipe for Brunswick stew,
an old Southern recipe that I have actually used several times.
</P>
<P>
   You have begun to prepare the dish and _ oops _ you've spilled a
spoonful of bacon fat on the pages. Well, these things happen.
Unstained cookbooks are unused cookbooks. From now on, the recipe
for Brunswick stew will be easy to find: the page is indelibly
marked.
</P>
<P>
   Now imagine instead that you have carried home your new $20 Joy
of Cooking CD-ROM. You switch on the computer, wait for it to boot
up, install the program and use the Find function to call up the
recipe for Brunswick stew. You begin to prepare the dish and _ oops
_ there goes that bacon fat again. These things happen, except
$2,000 computers are considerably less forgiving than $30 books
when it comes to bacon fat. In fact, they are remarkably intolerant
of spills of any kind.
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, might never happen. Does anybody, after all,
have a computer in the kitchen? Unlike conventional cookbooks,
cooking CD-ROMs are not kitchen tools. They are reference books for
the library. If you are going to use a recipe from a computerized
cookbook, you will probably print it out first, provided that,
unlike me, you have a printer.
</P>
<P>
   Then, even if you drop the fat, the recipe will be protected in
the computer. All you've damaged is the printout.
</P>
<P>
   A computerized cookbook clearly requires a different set of
instincts. For example, I like to browse through cookbooks until
something catches my eye. Opening up ``Joy of Cooking'' to
Brunswick stew, I can't help but notice the recipe immediately
before it, for country captain, another old-fashioned braised
chicken dish that I haven't thought about for ages.
</P>
<P>
   Flipping pages, I land by chance on a section describing the
characteristics of fish and learn that the black cod is the same as
the sable, which I never knew.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, to find the recipe for Brunswick stew on the
CD-ROM, I must go directly there. The only opportunity for detour
is a brief essay on chicken fricassees, stews and other braised
dishes. That will indeed give me the opportunity to click on
country captain, along with chicken cacciatore, chicken chile verde
and a dozen other recipes.
</P>
<P>
   But it takes an act of will, not chance, to get there, and I
won't end up learning about black cod, either.
</P>
<P>
   The real value of these CD-ROMs is in harnessing the organizing
power of the computer and applying it to the stuff of cooking.
CD-ROM cookbooks not only offer recipes, they also accept your own.
If you have the patience to type your personal set of recipes into
a computer, these CD-ROMs will arrange them for you, let you print
them out and analyze their nutritional values.
</P>
<P>
   No longer will you have tattered, stained and dog-eared recipes,
clipped from some defunct magazines, sticking haphazardly out of
cookbooks like so many loose ends. What's more, the CD-ROMs will
also organize shopping lists for you, refigure recipes depending on
the number of servings you desire, offer menu suggestions and even
search for recipes that meet your stated criteria.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, these functions are not all welcomed by everybody.
Some of us prefer tattered, dog-eared recipes and shopping lists
scrawled on the backs of old envelopes. We have no use for a
function that searches for recipes that can be cooked in less than
an hour because that's not how we decide what to cook. We don't
want a computer's menu suggestions.
</P>
<P>
   I suppose somebody like that might be described as a Luddite
after all. At least I won't spill anything on my computer.
</P>
<P>
   JOY OF COOKING (Simon &AMP; Schuster Interactive/Compuworks; $19.99;
Windows 95 and 98.)
</P>
<P>
   The classic American cookbook ``Joy of Cooking'' was originally
published in 1931. In 1997, a thoroughly revised ``Joy of Cooking''
was published, the first major revision in more than 20 years. It
took only another year for ``Joy'' to appear on CD-ROM.
</P>
<P>
   Those who despair of America's disposable culture may find
comfort in the link between the Depression-era homemaker seeking
inspiration in this kitchen bible and the modern computer user
clicking through its pages.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, times have changed more than a little bit. No longer
does the cookbook offer helpful hints about skinning squirrels and
simmering porcupines. People interested in past editions can
consult the history link on Joy's Web site (www.simonsays.com/joy).
Those interested in the present can consult the CD-ROM, which
reprints the entire 1,000-plus pages of the bound volume and costs
$10 less than the hardcover edition.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   If you are familiar with the book, the CD-ROM will look
familiar, too. The typeface is the same, though proportionately
bigger on the computer screen, and while you may encounter the same
sort of black-and-white illustrations that adorn the book, the
CD-ROM does not add any visual aids that take advantage of computer
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Whether offering recipes or discussing cooking techniques, the
CD-ROM is text-heavy and gray, though not dense, just like the
book.
</P>
<P>
   It does offer organizing aids, though. After calling up the
recipe for boeuf bourguignonne, I clicked on Ingredients, which
gave me a blown-up screen of just the ingredients. That would make
a useful printout for checking supplies or taking to the market.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, I don't have to settle for this list. Joy will create
a separate shopping list for me, organized by category. What's
more, if I'm planning more than one dish, Joy will consolidate the
ingredients for all the recipes on one list. It also lets you
delete and add ingredients if your needs go beyond these recipes.
</P>
<P>
   Joy offers other useful and flexible tools like scaling, in
which the computer will convert a recipe for 6 into a recipe for 4,
or 16. You can annotate recipes and keep the notes. You can add
your own recipes and organize them by categories like ingredients,
ethnicity and type of meal.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, Joy is simple to operate, so simple it
doesn't even come with a printed user's guide. One area in which I
could have used help was the Weblink, which apparently allows you
to exchange recipes with other people on the Web and to download
recipes directly into the cookbook. I connected to the Web and
started up Weblink but was unable to make it work.
</P>
<P>
   But on the whole, Joy is easy to use, like the bound cookbook,
and it demonstrates its good taste with an absence _ except when
you sign off _ of the annoying heraldic music so common in other
programs.
</P>
<P>
   WILLIAMS-SONOMA GUIDE TO GOOD COOKING &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Broderbund; $39.95; Windows 95 and 98, Power Macintosh.)
</P>
<P>
   There is music every step of the way with the Williams-Sonoma
Guide to Good Cooking. Music proclaims the opening of the program,
it underscores the movement from one area to another, it is
intensely irritating, and it is exactly what the mute button is
made for.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, this program is a likable cookbook, offering a
creatively organized set of recipes that are divisible in any
number of ways.
</P>
<P>
   The program opens with a Kitchen site. From there, you can go in
several directions: to the recipe index, which lists the 1,000
recipes from A to Z; to a useful glossary, which not only defines
ingredients like adzuki beans but also explains how to use them; to
a menu planner, where you can assemble your own menus, or to the
chief browsing device, the Recipe Finder.
</P>
<P>
   The finder allows you to search through the database in all
sorts of ways. You can seek out seasonal dishes, for example, or
search by cooking method, region, cooking time, ingredients or
courses. But that can get confusing. Let's say I want a main course
that can be made in 45 minutes or less, from Italy, with bacon as
an ingredient, that would be good in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   I plug all this into the recipe finder and come up with a grand
total of zero recipes. Yet if I replace ``spring'' with
``year-round,'' I find three recipes. The key, I guess, is to set a
couple of priorities and not be too precise.
</P>
<P>
   There are other confusing aspects. My search found 390 recipes
that take 60 minutes or less to prepare and 693 recipes that take
longer than an hour. Aside from the question of whether most people
want to spend that much time cooking, those recipes add up to
considerably more than the 1,000 supposedly in the database.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps you need a mind like a computer to understand. Of the
1,000 or so recipes, more than 600 are from Europe and the United
States, while 67 come from Asia, 47 from Mexico and 4 from Morocco.
</P>
<P>
   It is not at all clear what the criteria are for selecting
recipes, except that Williams-Sonoma figured that these would
appeal to a knowledgeable, curious audience. Many of these dishes
seem as if they would be perfectly at home on the menus of high-end
restaurants _ dishes like adzuki beans with baked eggplant, baked
fresh figs in port, fusilli with radicchio and smoked salmon, and
pork tenderloin with onion marmalade.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't test the recipes, but two I inspected carefully _
spaghetti carbonara and red beans and rice _ seemed both authentic
and practical.
</P>
<P>
   The Williams-Sonoma Guide is occasionally clunky. It is not
immediately clear how to move forward or back. You can adjust the
scale of recipes, but the adjustments are inflexible; you can alter
a recipe for 6 to serve 3 or 12, but not 4 or 8.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, ingredients are intelligently linked to the
glossary and when you have questions about techniques, the answers
are readily available. I had no problem finding a guide to carving
a turkey, for example.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   One thing the program does not do is organize your personal
recipes. You will just have to keep them in that tattered folder.
But the Williams-Sonoma Guide does many other things well. If only
it didn't have that music.
</P>
<P>
   THE COMPLETE INTERACTIVE COOKBOOK &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Compton's; $29.95; Windows 3.1 and later.)
</P>
<P>
   A recipe for ``a la king sauce'' is the first entry in The
Complete Interactive Cookbook. It's all downhill from there.
</P>
<P>
   The cookbook abounds with such cafeteria-style recipes, the sort
that will appeal to you if you love Jell-O molds, as well as dishes
that read like a list of third-prize winners at the county fair.
</P>
<P>
   Watercress and apple souffle caught my eye, as did guava jelly
and avocado ice cream. There's also a recipe for gourmet avocado
ice cream, a preparation involving whipped cream, brown sugar, egg
whites, chopped bananas and kiwi slices.
</P>
<P>
   I used the search device to look for all recipes with avocado,
and it revealed two. Those two, however, did not include either ice
cream, nor did they include avocado and orange pasta, which I
happened upon. Who knows how many other recipes with avocado are
lurking?
</P>
<P>
   The recipes are organized by books. You can switch from the Book
of Afternoon Tea to the Book of Garnishes to the Book of One-Pot
Cooking, 26 books in all. I found few of the recipes appealing. Why
would anybody want to make Crab Burritos with one-half cup of
mozzarella cheese, sour cream and _ yes _ avocados?
</P>
<P>
   Many recipes are also difficult to follow. The recipe for bercy
sauce, the classic French shallot-and-wine sauce, includes fish
veloute sauce but doesn't tell you what it is or how to make it.
You can find a reference to it under Related Recipes, but it should
be more clearly linked.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the information offered under Chef's Tips seems esoteric
rather than practical. Under the heading Salmon: Farming, we are
told that salmon farmers avoid chemicals and antibiotics, but we
are told nothing about how farmed salmon taste compared with wild.
In general, this cookbook doesn't have a point of view, except
maybe on avocados.
</P>
<P>
   THE COMPLETE MASTERCOOK SUITE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Sierra; $49.95; Windows 3.1 or higher, Macintosh.)
</P>
<P>
   The Complete Mastercook Suite must appeal to somebody; it calls
itself ``the No. 1 best-selling cooking series.'' I'm not sure what
that means, but its appeal is lost on me.
</P>
<P>
   When you begin the program, you are offered what looks to be a
bookshelf containing 12 volumes. It's a little too realistic; you
have to crane your neck uncomfortably to read the sideways writing
on the spines of the books. That's about as far as I got on my
desktop computer.
</P>
<P>
   An error message reading ``invalid printer'' stopped my computer
in its tracks. I managed to install Mastercook on my laptop,
though, and was able to proceed. I frankly found little of
interest, graphically or textually.
</P>
<P>
   After selecting one of those 12 volumes to open, you are
presented with a straightforward computer screen with a task bar
across the top. The text below is supposed to look like the pages
of a book. I chose Meatlovers Recipes, which included recipes for
chicken and beef, but not for any other meats.
</P>
<P>
   I guess pork and lamb don't count, or maybe the producers didn't
pay their dues _ all the chicken recipes seemed to come from the
National Broiler Council and the beef recipes from the National
Cattlemen's Beef Association, both big trade associations. You
could probably get these recipes free by writing to the trade
groups.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the recipes come from trade groups. The volume called
American Chefs includes recipes from restaurant chefs, but that
doesn't make the recipes any more winning. Some are downright
incomprehensible. Take one called bowl of the wife of Kit Carson,
from Dudley Cable-Larche of the Fort, a restaurant near Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Why is it called that? No explanation, but before visions of the
Donner party appear, you should know that it's actually a kind of
chicken, rice and bean soup. The chef explains that it is properly
known as caldo tlalpeno, but what's that got to do with Kit
Carson's wife?
</P>
<P>
   We may never know the answer, but we can get a precise
nutritional analysis. Each serving contains 564.1 calories, 21.7
grams of saturated fat and 1,753 milligrams of sodium, in case you
were wondering.
</P>
<P>
   Other parts of Mastercook also defy comprehension. Eleven of the
12 volumes have titles that are self-explanatory, like Bartender's
Guide, Bake-It and Kitchen Classics, but one volume is called Cole
International.
</P>
<P>
   I have not the slightest idea why and could find nothing to
explain it. If you open Entertain, you find all sorts of hors
d'oeuvres and canapes as well as a recipe for catfish with mustard
sauce. Why is that there? Mastercook is not telling.
</P>
<P>
   This CD-ROM doubtless has more to offer than I could find. A
selection of mini-videos offers visual explanations of techniques
like butterflying, kneading and flattening. And according to the
extremely dry 173-page handbook, you can do all sorts of other
things with the disk, like find recipes instantly, create your own
cookbooks and manage your wines.
</P>
<P>
   The package even includes two other CD-ROMs: Cooking Light and
Graham Kerr's Swiftly Seasoned. Frankly, when I couldn't find out
about Kit Carson's wife, I didn't want to know any more.

<TEXT>
<P>
   They can put a man on the moon _ but they can't silence the
teeth-rattling sputter of your neighbor's lawn mower on a Sunday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   Or can they?
</P>
<P>
   Well aware of the negative effects that an incessantly humming
generator, a suddenly whining siren or a sporadically grinding
power drill can have on the human psyche, scientists and
manufacturers have been searching for decades for a way to quiet
environmental noise.
</P>
<P>
   Most modern attempts to put a lid on the racket that surrounds
the human race have centered around a noise-canceling theory
developed in the 1870s by a British physicist, John William Strutt,
the third Baron Rayleigh. Although the theory is a relatively
simple one _ one type of noise is canceled by its opposite,
``anti-noise'' _ figuring out how to apply the theory to large,
loud machinery has been much more complex.
</P>
<P>
   The shrinking size of microprocessors and electronics has
spurred companies like the NCT Group of Stamford, Conn., to take
another look at noise cancellation. The bulky computers that were
used to analyze and reproduce sound 20 years ago have been replaced
by a single chip and a circuit board.
</P>
<P>
   The NCT Group, which developed noise cancellation technology in
the 1980s, is now focusing on consumer headsets, while it licenses
its technology to other companies for use in factories and cars.
</P>
<P>
   Individual consumer headsets using anti-noise technology to
muffle background din are now on the market from companies
including the NCT Group (its name comes from Noise Cancellation
Technologies), Sony Electronics and Sennheiser.
</P>
<P>
   But how does this technology use noise to quiet noise? Judging
from what happens when a 15-year-old stands next to his stereo
speaker with an electric guitar to play along with Led Zeppelin,
two noises definitely do not grow quieter when combined. The
objective of a noise cancellation system, however, is to create the
mirror opposite of the offending noise being produced so the two
noises cancel each other out.
</P>
<P>
   The technology revolves around what physicists call destructive
interference: a sound wave created by a noise can be canceled by a
sound wave that is the exact mirror opposite. The mirror-image
anti-noise sound wave has a trough where the noise wave has a peak,
and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   Does noise cancellation work? Well, yes, sort of. Most exhaust
noise is composed of both high and low frequencies, but active
noise canceling systems work most effectively on the
lower-frequency ones. High-frequency noise is harder to track
because of its more frequent peaks and crests.
</P>
<P>
   An active muffler is able to reduce constant low-frequency noise
levels by an average of 10 to 15 decibels. Because the noise level
that comes out of an average industrial generator is 90 to 100
decibels (the noise of a chain saw is about 100 decibels), the
active mufflers are able to cut generator noise by up to 15
percent.
</P>
<P>
   But such a device has virtually no effect on sudden
high-frequency sounds, like a dog's bark or baby's cry.
</P>
<P>
   The NCT Group (www.nct-active.com) licensed its technology to
Tenneco Automotive, a manufacturer in Illinois that makes silencers
for industrial generators, in the early 1990s. Tenneco Automotive
said it now had several hundred industrial silencers in operation.
When offending noise moves through a receiver of an industrial
noise cancellation silencer (which resembles some sort of
three-pronged lunar explorer module), a digital signal processor
analyzes the structure of the noise, copies it and creates its
anti-noise.
</P>
<P>
   Active Control, developed by Digisonix (a division of Nelson
Industries, itself owned by Cummins Engine Co., an exhaust and
filtration system manufacturer based in Stoughton, Wis.), is
another brand of noise cancellation technology. It is based on the
same principles but uses slightly different means to produce
anti-noise sound waves.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Although active noise control mufflers have been used
successfully to quiet industrial generator exhausts, the initial
attempts to develop silencing mufflers in the automotive industry
have backfired, so to speak, because it is hard to build
electronics components that can withstand the heat of car exhaust.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard to find processors that could live in that
environment,'' said Mary Woros, director of the Noise and Vibration
Center at General Motors.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, auto manufacturers like General Motors and
Ford were eager to develop active mufflers, and not just because
they would make cars quieter. The new mufflers would not generate
back pressure in the engine, as passive mufflers do, thereby
cutting fuel consumption by up to 5 percent and increasing engine
performance.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, noise-canceling mufflers almost made it onto
New York City buses as standard equipment. In 1993 the NCT Group,
in a joint venture with Walker Manufacturing, installed silencing
mufflers on buses.
</P>
<P>
   A processor chip analyzed the exhaust sound waves, and 220-watt
speakers at the tailpipes of each bus emitted noise-canceling sound
waves. Although the mufflers reduced fuel consumption by about 3
percent, they were ultimately too costly to maintain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tests didn't pan out because there were problems with
reliability and cost effectiveness,'' said Bob Slovak, a spokesman
for New York City Transit.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of building a noise-canceling muffler for a car starts
at about $200; that has been a problem because the cost of building
an ordinary muffler is about $60. But Clay Shipps, director of
automotive operations at Tenneco Automotive, speaking of the price
issue, said, ``I'm convinced that while it's been a hurdle in the
past, we're nearing the end.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, NCT Group has focused on designing Active Noise
Cancellation products for the consumer market, including individual
headsets marketed as Noisebusters. (NCT Group dissolved its
partnership with Walker Manufacturing and got out of the muffler
business in 1995. After that, Walker Manufacturing became known as
Walker Electronic Silencing, a division of Tenneco Automotive, and
licensed the technology from NCT Group.)
</P>
<P>
   Noise-canceling headsets use the same destructive interference
principle as industrial mufflers. A microphone detects the noise
signal and sends it to the system's processor, which immediately
copies it and creates an anti-noise signal that is sent through the
headset speakers. The headsets are best at muffling low-frequency
noise.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, United Airlines entered into an agreement with
NCT Group last year to supply its business-class passengers with
headsets as a weapon against monotonous engine noise. Many people
who buy these headsets are pilots of commercial and private planes,
who find that the headphones help reduce the steady low-frequency
noise that surrounds them.
</P>
<P>
   Ultra Electronics, an aerospace electronics company based in
Britain, also markets an active system for reducing airplane cabin
noise.
</P>
<P>
   NCT Group has also released a Clear Speech line of
communications products, including microphones for portable and car
cellular phones and a ``noise free'' speakerphone. Joanna Lipper, a
spokeswoman for NCT Group, said the company was also exploring ways
to apply the technology to home appliances like vacuum cleaners,
dishwashers and refrigerators.
</P>
<P>
   Now if they could just do something about those car alarms.

DOWNSIZING SOUND FILES 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By J.D. BIERSDORFER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. How can I convert a sound file in the WAV format used in the
Windows Sound Recorder to the smaller MIDI format so I can send the
file by e-mail?
</P>
<P>
   A. In general, it is quite hard, or almost impossible, to
convert a WAV file to a MIDI file accurately unless you have
high-end music editing software (like Sound2MIDI) and a simple WAV
file, featuring one instrument playing a single note at a time.
Sound-clip files in formats like the Windows WAV format (or AIFF in
Macintosh) can be rather large because they contain a great deal of
precise data.
</P>
<P>
   In comparison, MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) files
are relatively small _ but there is a reason for that. The files do
not contain any actual sound content; instead, they hold data that
tell the computer which notes to play and what instruments to use.
Think of a WAV file as a cake, and a MIDI file as a recipe.
</P>
<P>
   If file size is the issue, try using PKZIP or other software
designed to compress files. You might also try converting the WAV
file to a different sound format that takes up less space, like
MP3.
</P>
<P>
   There are many shareware programs on the Web that will let you
listen to, edit and convert sound files to different formats. An
excellent place to start looking for just about anything related to
digital audio is the Shareware Music Machine page, at www
.hitsquad.com/smm.

ON 2067 BATTLEGROUND, 1999 POLITICAL PASSIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By J.C. HERZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The year is 2067, and the United Nations Starship Unity hurtles
through space. Behind it: Earth, ravaged by war, famine and
disease. Ahead: a planet orbiting Alpha Centauri, where humankind
can make a new start. Aboard: thousands of cryogenically frozen men
and women with the skills to create a new society.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, things go disastrously awry. A reactor malfunction
destroys the ship's communications equipment and thaws the
passengers ahead of schedule. Aboard a damaged ship, with no way to
re-establish contact with Earth, the command team argues about how
best to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   Without consensus, chaos ensues. Factions consolidate around the
seven most powerful leaders, each of whom has a different vision of
how society should function in the new world. As the planet rises
in the near distance, the ship literally splits along ideological
lines, with each faction boarding a separate landing pod to the
planet's surface.
</P>
<P>
   Thus begins Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri, a strategy game that
marries Sim City to Frank Herbert's ``Dune.'' Unlike most strategy
games, in which all players have the same agenda (economic
dominance or military conquest), Alpha Centauri simulates a complex
competitive world where agendas often diverge.
</P>
<P>
   Each faction plays by a different set of rules, based on its
values, economic behavior and political philosophy. The Gaians, for
instance, are die-hard Greens led by a lissome Scottish botanist.
Appalled by the environmental atrocities on Earth, they are
determined to live in harmony with the planet.
</P>
<P>
   They are incredibly good at harnessing natural resources in a
sustainable fashion. They are fabulously efficient and highly
democratic. They are also pacifists. That becomes a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Contrast that with Morgan Industries, led by a Namibian diamond
tycoon whose only goal is untrammeled economic growth. The
Morganites' values are corporate, and their ideology is unfettered
laissez-faire capitalism. They require lots of resources to sustain
their high standard of living, and a healthy police force to keep
the underclass from burning down their luxury high-rises. But they
don't like war either. It's bad for business.
</P>
<P>
   War is no problem for the Lord's Believers, a fundamentalist
group whose leader hails from the Christian States of America.
Hostile acts against nonbelievers send morale through the roof. But
because its value system is based on faith, rather than knowledge,
the group has trouble developing new technology.
</P>
<P>
   At the University of Planet, new technology is a way of life.
Led by a Russian cybernetics genius, these are the hackers, the
techno-utopians and pure scientists with fast network access and
really cool toys who believe that research and development will
solve everything. Open networks accelerate the pace of discovery.
Unfortunately, they also make those discoveries easy to steal, but
hey, information wants to be free.
</P>
<P>
   In the Human Hive, an atheist, totalitarian collective,
information is never free. By order of Chairman Sheng-Ji Yang,
private property and civil rights have been abolished. Any
individual sacrifice is justified for the greater good. Housed in
underground fortresses, the Hive is a paragon of centralized
control: xenophobic, disciplined and heavily armed.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the Spartan Federation, rallied by the ship's chief
of security, is a highly decentralized group of paramilitary
survivalists whose only binding philosophy is the right to bear
arms.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, there is the Peacekeeping Forces, whose East Indian
commissioner hews to the United Nations' humanitarian, democratic
ideals _ and battles the plague of bureaucratic inefficiency.
</P>
<P>
   As the leader of any given faction, you explore the planet,
build cities, conduct research and confront other groups. You may
resolve the inevitable conflicts diplomatically. If you are
suitably equipped, you may also wipe rival factions off the face of
the map. You can violate treaties. You can lie. You can commit
atrocities, if you're willing to make enemies and incur sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   You can spark dissent. Or you can cooperate to achieve a higher
goal _ engineering a global trade agreement, solving an
environmental crisis or pulling off a project that no single group
can achieve on its own.
</P>
<P>
   How you play depends on what you're trying to win. You can win a
standard military victory by conquering everyone. You can win a
diplomatic victory by getting yourself elected planetary governor.
Or you can achieve economic dominance by cornering the world energy
market.
</P>
<P>
   Alternately, you can shoot for Ascent to Transcendence, the
ultimate stage of human evolution _ a spiritual triumph that
requires staggering amounts of technology.
</P>
<P>
   When different players strive for different kinds of victory,
the game becomes something more than king of the hill or Monopoly.
It gets complicated _ and interesting. There are natural alliances
and natural antipathies and shifting constituencies, sudden
betrayals and conciliatory back-scratching.
</P>
<P>
   There are questions about expediency and questions about trust,
particularly when you're playing against other human beings in real
time _ or online games that involve a combination of human beings
and computer opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``On line, people mostly gang up on the computer,'' said Meier,
who has only recently turned to science fiction after designing
historical simulation games like Gettysburg and Civilization.
``They band together to beat the artificial intelligence. And then
when they've beaten the computer, they'll go after each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``But sometimes, maybe they're so invested in building these
cities and getting their societies up and running that they don't
want it to end. But when someone wins, by conquest or ascent or
whatever, that's it, the game's over.
</P>
<P>
   The world goes away. So someone says, `Hold off, I'm working on
a really cool technology right now, let's just keep it going.' If
someone looks like he's going to win militarily, they just all keep
him from doing that. They agree not to end the game.''
</P>
<P>
   In online geopolitics, sometimes a stalemate is as good as it
gets.

   When completely cooled, break apart any nut clusters that may
have formed. Use a rolling pin and roll over the nuts to crush
them. Another technique is to hold one end of the rolling pin on
the table and crush the nuts by bringing the other end of the
rolling pin up and down on top of them. Be gentle, or the nuts will
fly all over the place. Set praline aside until ready to use.
</P>

   Filling:
</P>
<P>
   Scant 2 1/4 cups heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   Grated zest of 1/2 orange
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon Grand Marnier
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup golden raisins, hydrated with 1/4 cup dark rum, see Note
</P>
<P>
   1 cup M&AMP;M milk chocolate mini baking bits
</P>
<P>
   Note: Place raisins in glass jar and add water so it covers
raisins by at least 1/2 inch. Stir in rum. Cover with plastic wrap
and place in refrigerator for 24 hours. It's better to allow
raisins to hydrate for 2-3 days; they will become very plump as
they absorb the liquid. Strain the amount that you need through a
fine mesh sieve before adding to the recipe.
</P>
<P>
   Place heavy cream in medium mixing bowl and whip to soft peaks
using an electric mixer set on medium-high speed. Store whipped
cream in refrigerator until ready to use.

by pouring the hot sugar down the side of the mixing bowl into the
whipping whites. Be careful not to pour the hot sugar directly onto
the beaters, or it will splatter. Whip meringue until stiff and
glossy, about 5 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Finish filling by folding orange zest and Grand Marnier into
whipped cream using a rubber spatula. Then fold the meringue into
the whipped cream, being careful not to deflate either mixture.
Fold in the crushed praline, raisins and the mini baking bits.
Don't mix the chocolate or too much of the color will fade.
</P>
<P>
   Pour mixture into a 10-inch loaf pan and use an offset spatula
to smooth the top. Place in freezer for a few hours to set.
</P>
<P>
   To unmold, dip pan in hot water for about 5 seconds. Invert a
flat plate over the loaf pan. Place one hand on either side,
grasping both plate and loaf pan, and flip them so the loaf pan is
on top. Gently lift off loaf pan. Use a hot chef's knife to slice
the dessert. To heat knife, dip in hot water and wipe it dry before
each slice. The dessert can be served with raspberry and mango
sauce; chocolate sauce is another good choice.

   CARAMEL-DIPPED FRUIT
</P>
<P>
   Yields 1 pound
</P>
<P>
   Scant 1/2 cup water
</P>
<P>
   Generous 2 1/4 cup granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   Scant 2/3 cup light corn syrup
</P>
<P>
   1 pound fresh fruit
</P>
<P>
   Note: The fruit must be at room temperature when you coat it.
The fruit should be coated about 3 hours before you plan to serve
it. Also, for safety's sake, when working with caramel, it is smart
to have a bowl of cold water nearby. If you get hot sugar on your
fingers, immediately dip them in cold water to remove it and avoid
a burn.
</P>
<P>
   Place water, sugar and corn syrup in a 2-quart heavy-bottomed
saucepan over medium-high heat. The corn syrup will make the cooked
sugar harder and crunchier; it will also help prevent the cooked
sugar from melting as quickly when it reacts to the humidity in the
air. Insert a candy thermometer and cook sugar mixture to 311
degrees, what is known as the hard-crack stage. Stir sugar slowly
as it cooks to ensure that it cooks evenly. If you don't stir it,
the mixture will develop hot spots and the sugar will cook faster
in those spots. Use a pastry brush to keep the inside of the
saucepan clean as the sugar cooks, or the sugar may recrystallize.
To do this, dip a clean brush in cold water and brush the inside of
the pan's sides clean.
</P>
<P>
   Remove cooked sugar from heat and pour into a medium-size
heat-proof glass bowl. The glass bowl will hold the temperature and
stop the cooking process. It will allow you to reheat the sugar in
the microwave if necessary. If you leave the sugar in the saucepan,
the sugar will continue to cook and turn dark brown. Occasionally
stir the hot sugar to keep it from darkening because of the
residual heat. Stirring also helps to keep the temperature even.
Put a towel under the bowl to keep it from tipping and to protect
your hands from the heat of the glass.
</P>
<P>
   Peel, core or pit, and halve the fruit as necessary. Use a sharp
knife to slice the fruit into small pieces. (This is not necessary
for berries or grapes.) Arrange fruit on toothpicks or small
skewers in any combination you like. Leave enough room at one end
of the toothpick or skewer so you will be able to hold it as you
dip it in the hot sugar. Dip each toothpick in the hot sugar,
coating the fruits completely. Wipe the toothpick against the rim
of the bowl to remove any excess sugar and place on a sheet of
parchment paper. Repeat until all of the fruit has been dipped. The
fruit skewers should release easily from the parchment paper as
soon as they cool. You can arrange them on a plate, or use your
imagination to make a fruit-skewer centerpiece.

<P>
   STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE
</P>
<P>
   Yields 8-10
</P>
<P>
   Scones:
</P>
<P>
   4 cups bread flour
</P>
<P>
   1 2/3 cups cake flour
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons PLUS 1 teaspoon baking powder
</P>
<P>
   Generous 1/2 cup granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons salt
</P>
<P>
   3 1/3 cups heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup golden raisins
</P>
<P>
   1 cup blanched almonds, toasted and chopped
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup whole milk
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Place first 6 ingredients in medium mixing bowl. Use an electric
mixer set on medium to mix ingredients just until combined. (This
can also be done by hand.) Stir in raisins and almonds. When
ingredients are fully incorporated and dough holds together, turn
it onto a lightly floured work surface. Knead gently for about 1
minute, just until dough is smooth. If you overwork dough, it will
shrink during baking. Use a rolling pin to roll dough gently into a
1/2-inch-thick rectangle. Use a 4-inch fluted cutter to cut circles
from the dough. Place them on a parchment paper-covered baking
sheet. Brush tops of scones with milk and place in oven. Bake until
well-risen and evenly golden brown, about 20 minutes. Remove from
oven and cool on wire rack until ready to use.
</P>
<P>
   Ganache:
</P>
<P>
   1 1/3 cups heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons loose orange pekoe tea
</P>
<P>
   11.5 ounces bittersweet chocolate, finely chopped
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons Grand Marnier
</P>
<P>
   Heat heavy cream and tea together in 2-quart heavy-bottomed
saucepan until bubbles begin to form around edge of pan. Make sure
you have chopped the chocolate as finely as possible so it will
melt quickly and easily. Place chopped chocolate in medium mixing
bowl. Make ganache by straining hot cream mixture through a
fine-mesh sieve into chocolate and letting it sit for 30 seconds to
melt the chocolate. Then slowly whisk until smooth and homogeneous.
A hand-held immersion blender ensures a smooth ganache and keeps
the emulsion of the chocolate. Mix until all the hot cream is
incorporated and ganache is smooth and homogeneous. If ganache
separates, it's easy to fix. It should come back together when you
add a small amount of chilled cream and whisk well. The ganache
should be thick, shiny and smooth. Add the Grand Marnier and mix
until fully incorporated. Pour ganache into a bowl. Cover with
plastic wrap and allow to cool for at least 4 hours at room
temperature. As it cools, it will thicken and set. The ganache is
ready to be used when consistency is similar to that of toothpaste.
</P>
<P>
   To assemble:
</P>
<P>
   2 cups heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup powdered sugar
</P>
<P>
   About 3 cups fresh strawberries
</P>
<P>
   Pour heavy cream and sugar into medium mixing bowl and whip to
soft peaks with electric mixer set on medium. Place whipped cream
in pastry bag fitted with 1/2-inch star tip.
</P>
<P>
   Use serrated knife to slice each scone in half. Each half can be
sprinkled with a little Grand Marnier, but that's optional. Spread
a 1/4-inch-thick layer of ganache over bottom half of scone. Hull
and halve strawberries. Cover ganache with the strawberries. Pipe
whipped cream on top of strawberries. Cover with top half of scone
and place on plate.

   FROZEN NOUGAT PARFAIT
</P>
<P>
   Serves 8
</P>
<P>
   Praline:
</P>
<P>
   Scant 1/2 cup granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup water
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cups plus 2 tablespoons hazelnuts, blanched
</P>
<P>
   Place sugar and water in copper pot or 2-quart heavy-bottomed
saucepan over medium-high heat and bring mixture to a boil. Add
hazelnuts and stir to coat them evenly in the sugar syrup. Your
goal is to cook the hazelnuts until sugar crystallizes and
caramelizes.
</P>
<P>
   When you added water to the sugar, you dissolved the crystals.
As it boils, the syrup becomes thicker as the water evaporates and
big soaplike bubbles begin to form. Soon, all the moisture
evaporates, and the mixture becomes sandy. The sandiness is the
sugar recrystallizing. It takes the re-formation of just one sugar
crystal to recrystallize the others. Keep stirring. Next, you see
the sugar closest to the heat change from sandy to a clear liquid.
The melted sugar clings to the hazelnuts. When the sugar changes
from clear to golden brown, the nuts are caramelized. Once this
happens, pay close attention; the time it takes to pass from
caramelized to burned is only a matter of seconds, especially when
making smaller batches. You know the nuts are finished when most of
the sandy sugar is gone.
</P>
<P>
   Tip: The first few times you make these, try this: When the
sugar closest to the heat changes from sandy to liquid, remove pan
from burner and continue to stir. The residual heat in the sugar
and nuts will continue to cook the mixture while you stir it.
Reduce heat to medium-low and continue to stir the nuts while
moving the saucepan on and off the heat at 10-second intervals.
This will give you more control as it cooks. When nuts begin to
caramelize, remove them from heat and finish stirring.
</P>
<P>
   Use a wooden spoon to spread the caramelized nuts onto a
parchment paper-covered baking sheet. Don't touch the nuts; they
are extremely hot. Let the nuts cool completely. If your freezer
will accommodate the baking sheet, you can place nuts in the
freezer for about 30 minutes to speed up the cooling.

<P>
   When Lisa Castagliuolo, a teacher, sent a wish list of items for
her kindergarten classroom to parents, she asked for books, a new
rug and computers.
</P>
<P>
   Her wish came true about a year ago when Denise Madrigale, who
had a daughter in Miss Castagliuolo's class at Christ the King
Regional School in Haddonfield, N.J., replaced the IBM 386 she had
been using for about seven years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We upgraded to a 486, and I stuck the 386 in the closet to get
it out of the way,'' said Mrs. Madrigale. She thought about keeping
it around in case she ever needed a replacement monitor or
keyboard, because she was not sure anyone else could use it. Then
she offered it to Miss Castagliuolo.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first I thought maybe I was just giving her a
paperweight,'' she said. ``But she was thrilled.''
</P>
<P>
   The teacher used the PC to create a computer center where
students could independently use reading and math learning programs
such as Reader Rabbit. A few months later, another parent donated
another computer.
</P>
<P>
   More than 49 million American households now have personal
computers, and Americans upgrade their computers on average about
once every five years, according to David Tremblay, senior industry
analyst for ZD Market Intelligence, based in La Jolla, Calif. That
means that every year, millions of computer owners wrestle with the
problem of how to dispose of a computer that is still in working
order.
</P>
<P>
   Studies have shown that relatively few computers are reused, and
that many of the rest wind up in the closet or the basement.
Sometimes those who try to give the computer another life cannot
find a willing recipient.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time people call us, they are frustrated,'' said John
L. German, director of Non-Profit Computing, Inc., a 15-year-old
New York City organization that places used computers with
nonprofit companies, government agencies and schools.
</P>
<P>
   He says donors often tell his group that they have made calls to
other institutions but rarely find any takers for computers less
advanced than 486 or Pentium level.
</P>
<P>
   But some pre-schools and elementary schools are still in the
market for less advanced second-hand computers because they don't
necessarily need Internet access or a lot of memory. For
kindergartens and pre-schools, a computer that can run simple
learning programs might be just enough.
</P>
<P>
   One Christ the King pre-school teacher, Donna Bigos, did not
have a computer for her 3- and 4-year-old students until this year
when she donated her own Packard Bell machine, with a 386 chip, to
her classroom. Her children use it for letter-matching games and
number recognition programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wait their turn to go on it,'' she said. ``They think
they're a big kid because they are on a computer. They all went
home and said, `Guess what we have now?'''
</P>
<P>
   High schools are not often in the market for used computers
these days, but middle schools, elementary and pre-schools often
can find uses for obsolete machines like an Apple II, said
Geraldine Russell, assistant director of the Pennsylvania Space
Grant Consortium, which oversees Scrounge (www.psu.edu/spacegrant),
a five-year-old nonprofit program at Penn State that accepts
donated computers and distributes them to schools and community
groups.
</P>
<P>
   Although many people want to give away old XTs and Commodores,
she said, few places will take them. Nevertheless, such computers
can be useful for giving young children experience in word
processing.
</P>
<P>
   ``In elementary school they are not going to need all the
capabilities,'' of new computers, said Janet Bird, who teaches
fifth grade at Jonestown Elementary School, in rural south-central
Pennsylvania. Ms. Bird, who received a donated Compaq with a 386
chip in 1998 through Scrounge, wanted a computer for her 23
students so that they could write stories and print them out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not getting into big programs and we don't need
something that runs that fast,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   If schools cannot put second-hand computers into operation in
the classroom, teachers can often find other uses for them. At
Plymouth Meeting Friends School near Philadelphia, old donated
computers are the raw material for a class where students take them
apart and learn how they work.
</P>
<P>
   In Cherry Hill, N.J., only donated computers with Pentium chips
go into the classroom, said John Scarinci, the school district's
technology director.
</P>
<P>
   Donations of computers are most helpful when the manuals and
software come with the computer. If donating software, the owner
should read the manufacturer's licensing agreement first.
</P>
<P>
   Common practice in the industry suggests that if a person is
donating a computer, software goes along with it _ as long as the
person making the donation doesn't keep a copy. Nancy Anderson, a
Microsoft attorney, said that people donating Microsoft software
should also give the recipient all manuals and other materials, and
added, ``They should make sure there is no other copy that is being
retained.''
</P>
<P>
   Donors should also be careful to clean out all files. Just
reformatting the hard drive will not erase all information. It is
better to use a utility program to clean the disk.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some listings that may be useful to those wishing to

THE TULIP, FROM STEW POT TO CACHEPOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ANNE RAVER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ ``You never know why a love affair starts,'' said
Anna Pavord, a British garden writer who has had quite an affair
with the tulip. Moreover, she said, ``an affair can't be sustained
over a long period unless that object of your affection is
mysterious and endlessly fascinating, revealing things you didn't
know _ it's such an incredibly complicated flower.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Pavord, who grows 4,000 tulips in her garden in Dorset, was
in Philadelphia on March 13 for the annual flower show. After that
she was heading up to Boston, then down to New York, to rhapsodize
about the object of her affection, ``the flower that made men
mad,'' as she likes to say, and to stump for her new book, ``The
Tulip'' (Bloomsbury, $35).
</P>
<P>
   This is no dry, botanical tome, though its botany is gracefully
woven into the tale. ``The Tulip'' reads more like an adventure
story, written against a backdrop of a 16th- and 17th-century
Europe booming with trade _ first with the Ottoman Empire to the
East, and then with the New World to the West, its ports shifting
from the Mediterranean to Antwerp and Amsterdam. ``Those became the
places where everybody traded in and out,'' Ms. Pavord said. ``So
massive amounts of money were slopping around, and people had spare
cash to gamble.''
</P>
<P>
   The tall, hearty-looking writer had paused for coffee and
conversation at John Bartram's house on the Schuylkill, where the
Colonial plant explorer and botanist grew the stewartias and
scarlet maples that would eventually enliven the pastoral
landscapes of Capability Brown, landscapes that would supplant huge
plantings of tulips.
</P>
<P>
   Some 400 years ago, when European travelers brought news of a
``red lily'' back from Constantinople, and the first bulbs arrived
in Vienna, few Europeans had ever seen a tulip. ``When the first
bulbs came from the East,'' Ms. Pavord said, ``the Dutch thought
they were a type of onion and stewed them up in broth.''
</P>
<P>
   They became an immediate status symbol in a culture that loved
curiosities, be they insects, monkeys, shells or single flowers so
beautiful they were treasured like jewels. The tulip soon bewitched
those who grew it with its mysterious ability to transform itself
from plain red or yellow to petals fabulously feathered and flamed
with white and deep red.
</P>
<P>
   Just as alchemists of the day strove to turn base metal to gold,
tulip breeders were driven to discover the means of this flowery
transformation. They tried everything from pigeon dung to mixing
powdered paint into their tulip beds, as the price of ``broken'' or
flamed bulbs rose higher and higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``This tulip was worth more than gold,'' Ms. Pavord said.
``Nobody knew how to bring it about. They couldn't have known
because the whole thing could only be unraveled when man had
invented the electron microscope to see something as small as a
virus.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a virus spread by aphids that caused the tulip to
``break'' into various colors, something that was discovered only
earlier in this century. The virus also weakened the bulb, so that
it produced fewer offsets, or bulblets, for new tulips. So by its
very scarcity, the broken tulip became more valuable.
</P>
<P>
   By the beginning of the 17th century, tulip madness was sweeping
through France, where a thriving brewery was traded to a grower for
a single bulb called Tulipe Brasserie. One bride had a dowry of a
single bulb, a double red and white striped prize aptly named
Mariage de Ma Fille by her father.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1630s, tulipomania gripped Dutch growers. By the 1700s,
it had swirled back to Turkey, where Sultan Ahmed III imported
millions of bulbs from Holland for his imperial gardens. When his
subjects grew tired of seeing so much money squandered on tulip
festivals, his extravagance brought on a revolt.
</P>
<P>
   All this is skillfully told by Ms. Pavord, who started
collecting tulip lore 20 years ago, from postcards, prints and
tiles. She stumbled on the odd clue here and there while pursuing
topics for her weekly garden columns for The Independent in London
and for her frequent articles in Gardens Illustrated magazine. She
also collected the 150 color illustrations in the book: paintings,
woodcuts and other visual expressions of the tulip's reign.
</P>
<P>
   About seven years ago, when she felt she was drowning in her
material, she set to work writing the book, holing up for two weeks
every month in a rented cottage on an old Capability Brown estate
in Lincolnshire, an hour's drive from the libraries at Cambridge
University, the Cambridge Botanic Garden and the Fitzwilliam
Museum, which, she said, has the greatest collection of English
flower paintings in England. She roamed far and wide over the
Middle East in search of the wild tulips that started the craze.
And still, she is hungry for more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would love to do a book on the British florists,'' she said,
meaning the amateur growers who brought the tulip back from
oblivion in the 18th and 19th centuries. ``Or write about the
tulip's influence on the decorative arts.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Pavord, who graduated with honors in English from the
University of Leicester and is fluent in French, pored through
historic documents, many in their original language. That helped in
deciphering what she calls the ``muddle about the tulip's name.''
Ms. Pavord recalled an afternoon in the Royal Horticultural
Society's Lindley Library in London, where she was trolling through
a 17th century French text, ``bound in vellum, smelling of age.''
</P>
<P>
   She was reading the journals of Pierre Belon, who had a famous
garden in the south of France. Belon, an avid traveler, referred to
the ``red lilies'' the Turks tucked into their turbans in his
journal.
</P>
<P>
   ``My ears pricked up,'' she said. ``I knew there were lilies
growing in Turkey, but I couldn't remember any that were red. So I
double-checked in The Flora of Turkey, and I was right. No red
lilies in Turkey. So I thought those must be tulips. They just
weren't called tulips, because nobody in the West knew what to call
them.''
</P>
<P>
   So she went back to the very first botanical books in the 1500s.
There were woodcuts that clearly were of tulips, but the flowers
were called lilies.
</P>
<P>
   ``So that was one of those huge great shots of light into the
brain,'' Ms. Pavord said. She believes that the tulip got its name
from a mistranslation. The Flemish Ambassador pointed at the flower
in a Turk's turban and asked, ``What is that?'' Thinking he meant
the turban, not the flower, the translator answered ``tulipam.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time E.H. Krelage used the new Darwin tulips in massed
plantings in the Jardin du Trocadero to catch the eye of the crowds
flocking to the Universal Exhibition in Paris in 1889, the tulip
was becoming the darling of Victorian bedding schemes.
</P>
<P>
   Americans continued this love affair, as the first settlers of
New Amsterdam planted bulbs in their gardens. ``So underneath those
great Manhattan skyscrapers sit the ghosts of those very first
tulips that were ever grown in American soil,'' Ms. Pavord said.
And who knows, a descendant of one of them, broken into flames by a
virus, might be getting ready to push its way out of the ground
right now.

NEW BOOK PROVIDES FRESH INSIGHTS INTO CLINTON'S CHARACTER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, March 21)   (For Use By New York Times News Service Clients)  
 By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 c. 1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Few observers have defined the tragedy and the
meaning of Bill Clinton's presidency more incisively than George
Stephanopoulos, who was practically a member of his family during
his first four years in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of Stephanopoulos' memoirs, ``All Too Human; A
Political Education,'' he writes, ``The Clinton I know is a
complicated man responding to the pressures and pleasures of public
life in ways I found both awesome and appealing. I have come to see
how his shamelessness is a key to his political success, how his
capacity for denial is tied to the optimism that is his greatest
political strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``For every reckless and expedient act, there are others of
leadership and vision.''
</P>
<P>
   Millions of words have been written about the 42nd president,
and millions more will be written in the future.
</P>
<P>
   But few will capture the essence and the paradox, the good and
the bad, of Clinton better than those brief observations by
Stephanopoulos.
</P>
<P>
   The onetime presidential aide has been criticized for writing
the intimate details about life in the Clinton White House as he
witnessed them. Some critics contend that he has laid bare for
public consumption the description of personal events that should
have remained private at least until Clinton's presidency ends.
</P>
<P>
   New York Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, appearing on television,
described the writing of such tell-tale books as part of the
``vulgarization'' of American politics. There are no longer any
gentlemen in American politics, Moynihan said.
</P>
<P>
   But the book for which Stephanopoulos reputedly was paid $2.7
million is not mean. It reflects the author's disappointment and
disenchantment as well as his bitterness. For a few brief years,
Stephanopoulos was extremely close to Bill and Hillary Clinton, and
the book conveys a belief that he still feels strong ties to them.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanopoulos is a highly intelligent young man, but it is
doubtful that he would be as wealthy and as prominent today had it
not been for Clinton. In other words, he has bit the hand that
anointed him.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by Newsweek magazine if he is proud that he worked for
Clinton, Stephanopoulos replied: ``It's a question I still struggle
with. We accomplished, and he has accomplished, more that I ever
thought humanly possible. But he lost the battle with himself,
tarnished his presidency and all of us associated with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I knew everything then that I know now, of course I
wouldn't (have worked for him). But he's been a good steward, and I
think he's been a good president, despite these horrible flaws.''
</P>
<P>
   Millions of Americans who opposed Clinton's impeachment and his
removal from office could identify with that assessment.
</P>
<P>
   But Stephanopoulos weakens his own claim to innocence by
recording that he got a candid view of Clinton's deceitfulness as
far back as the 1992 presidential campaign when the candidate lied
about reports that he had had a long-running affair with Gennifer
Flowers and that he had dodged the draft during the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   By election night, when Clinton defeated George Bush and Ross
Perot, Stephanopoulos writes, ``I had learned to calculate, scheme
and maneuver _ to say things I didn't fully believe and do things I
might later regret while telling myself that, maybe, it would do
some good ... ''
</P>
<P>
   The tragedy lies not in Stephanopoulos' revelations about
Clinton's weaknesses and recklessness. During the lengthy
impeachment hearings in the House and trial in the Senate, the
public learned anew that the boy from Hope is not Little Lord
Fauntleroy. The tragedy stems from the fact that Clinton, through
his own misbehavior, plundered his own potential.
</P>
<P>
   The president has proved that he has the capacity to be an
outstanding, if sometimes vacillating, chief executive but often is
barred by his own character flaws from doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanopoulos provides his readers with some fascinating
insights into Bill Clinton's character and his temper tantrums and
Hillary Clinton's despair and loneliness as she watched the
Whitewater investigation expand and her health care reform plan
die.
</P>
<P>
   But Stephanopoulos also records some lighter moments, including
the on-again-off again efforts of Clinton, Stephanopoulos and
others in the White House to convince Mario Cuomo, who was the
highly regarded governor of New York and a powerful voice in the
Democratic Party, to accept an appointment to the Supreme Court in
1993.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, although annoyed with Cuomo's Hamlet-like indecision,
is quoted by Stephanopoulos as saying, ``Mario will sing the song
of America. It'll be like watching Pavarotti at Christmastime.''
But in the end, after lengthy negotiations through Cuomo's son,
Andrew, Mario refused to sing.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court seat, from which Byron White was retiring,
went to Ruth Bader Ginsberg.
</P>
<P>
   The same year, when Clinton needed a single Senate vote to win
passage of his economic plan that included a tax increase on the
richest Americans, that vote was held by Nebraska's Bob Kerrey. A
war hero who lost part of a leg in Vietnam, Kerrey, like Cuomo, was
held in high regard by Democrats even though he had been defeated
by Clinton in the 1992 presidential primaries.
</P>
<P>
   To provide the winning vote on the economic package,
Stephanopoulos writes, Kerrey wanted to be named chairman of a new
commission on economic priorities. It took a lot of negotiating,
including a private Kerrey audience with the president, but in the
end the Nebraskan cast the vote that provided Clinton with victory
in the Senate and Kerrey with his chairmanship.
</P>
<P>
   Tales such as those make for interesting reading. On the larger
question of whether White House insiders should record such
revelations while their former boss remains in the Oval Office, the
answer is: As long as publishers offer $2.7 million for such
memoirs, they will be written.

PEACE ACTIVIST VIVIAN HALLINAN DIES AT 88 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SETH ROSENFELD  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Vivian Hallinan, the preeminent peace activist
and matriarch of San Francisco's best known Irish political family,
died Tuesday in Berkeley. She was 88.
</P>
<P>
   Family members said she had been in poor health in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Over a five-decade span, Mrs. Hallinan played a prominent part
in San Francisco's progressive politics with grace, beauty and
courage. In 1986 she was tear-gassed in Chile while protesting
human rights abuses there.
</P>
<P>
   Although her late husband, the legal legend Vincent Hallinan,
was publicly perceived as the more radical of the pair, Vivian
Hallinan fueled the family's political fire, two of her sons said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was really the heart and soul of our family's political
philosophy,'' said Patrick Hallinan, her eldest son. ``My father
resented the abuse of political authority, but my mother had a
focus. She was a very committed radical socialist.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Hallinan combined a dedication to her family, prowess in
real estate and political passion.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said Tuesday that Vivian Hallinan
showed women they could combine family and politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a role model for many of us,'' Pelosi said. ``If
Vincent was the lion, Vivian was the lioness.''
</P>
<P>
   Her son Patrick is a prominent criminal defense lawyer. Another
son, Terence, is the district attorney in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Hallinan was born Vivian Moore on Oct. 21, 1910, in San
Francisco. Her father was Irish, her mother Italian, her family
blue-collar.
</P>
<P>
   Her father abandoned the family early on, and she hardly knew
him, Patrick Hallinan said. Though her mother was more present,
Mrs. Hallinan was grew up mainly with her mother's relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Hallinan attended Girls' High School, a now-defunct private
Catholic school in San Francisco. She was admitted to the
University of California at Berkeley but quit after two years to
support herself by working in retail shops, Patrick Hallinan said.
She never graduated.
</P>
<P>
   She soon met Vincent Hallinan on a blind date. He was 13 years
older and already a famous liberal lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I opened the door, I thought she was the most beautiful
thing I'd ever seen,'' he once said.
</P>
<P>
   They were married in 1932, an occasion reported by the late FBI
Director J. Edgar Hoover as ``a case of one warped personality
marrying another.''
</P>
<P>
   The excitement began promptly. As the couple left for their
honey moon, Vincent Hallinan was jailed for contempt of court for
refusing to surrender a client in a murder case. One headline read:
``Hallinan goes to jail, bride goes home.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Hallinan's striking beauty, with brunet hair and hazel
eyes, was part of her persona, said Doris Brin Walker, a San
Francisco lawyer and longtime friend of the Hallinans'.
</P>
<P>
   ``She always looked great,'' Walker said, ``but it was not the
most important part.''
</P>
<P>
   During the Depression, Mrs. Hallinan began investing some of her
husband's legal earnings in real estate, refurbishing abandoned
buildings and eventually building the family fortune, Terence
Hallinan said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Mrs. Hallinan held socialist views _ ideas that people
should be guaranteed a decent living, that there should racial
equality and an end to war _ she never joined any socialist or
communist party and was a life-long Democrat, Patrick Hallinan
said.
</P>
<P>
   She was one of San Francisco's early civil rights activists,
renting and selling homes to blacks. Her efforts earned the enmity
of other real estate agents and her own neighbors, her sons said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1945, the Hallinans moved to politically conservative Ross in
Marin County, because it had the best public schools. They bought a
22-room house with its own gym and an Olympic-size pool.
</P>
<P>
   But times got hard. In 1950, Mr. Hallinan was sentenced to six
months in prison for a contempt citation he got while successfully
defending union leader Harry Bridges against charges of being a
communist.
</P>
<P>
   In 1952, after Mrs. Hallinan persuaded her husband to campaign
for president on Henry Wallace's Progressive Party ticket, the
couple were indicted for tax evasion. She was acquitted, but he was
sentenced to two years in jail.
</P>
<P>
   The government seized some of the family's real estate holdings,
Terence Hallinan said. And Doubleday refused to print more copies
of a national best-seller she had written about her family, ``My
Wild Irish Rogues,'' Patrick Hallinan said.
</P>
<P>
   Hoover had branded the book as ``a flagrant employment of the
Communist Party line, including references to racial discrimination
and vicious attacks on the U.S. government.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Hallinan was unfazed: She sustained the family with her
real estate business and continued her jailed husband's
presidential campaign on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Vincent Hallinan was disbarred and in jail during most of the
1950s, and Mrs. Hallinan remained under Hoover's scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   She once avoided FBI agents by renting a horse near the family's
summer cottage outside Yosemite National Park and riding into the
High Sierra, said Phil Ryan, a San Francisco writer and lawyer who
grew up around the Hallinan house.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a riotous, wonderful place to be,'' he said. ``She
presided over a family where there was no idea which could not be
thought.''
</P>
<P>
   She helped organize anti-Vietnam war demonstrations, leading a
march of 5,000 women in Washington, D.C. She headed the San
Francisco chapter of the Women's International League for Peace and
Freedom.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, she opposed U.S. policy in Central America and
befriended Daniel Ortega, Nicaragua's Sandinista leader. She also
met with Fidel Castro.

   _ Inform passengers of all fares being charged on a given flight
and all reasons why a flight is being delayed, diverted or
canceled.
</P>
<P>
   _ Disclose more information about frequent flier programs and
how many tickets per flight are set aside for program participants.
</P>
<P>
   _ Deliver checked luggage to passengers within 24 hours of

</P>
<P>
   AIRLINE PASSENGER BILL OF RIGHTS
</P>
<P>
   Sponsor: Rep. Bud Shuster, R-Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines would be required to:
</P>
<P>
   _ Pay compensation to passengers kept waiting on the runway for
more than two hours prior to take-off or after landing. The
compensation would be the value of the ticket times the number of
hours of waiting. Delays due to air traffic control would not
require compensation.
</P>
<P>
   _ Explain the reasons for a delay, cancellation or diversion to
a different airport, and pay penalties in cases of false or
misleading explanations.
</P>
<P>
   _ Refund the money to any passenger on a flight that is
cancelled for economic reasons.
</P>
<P>
   _ Notify passengers, in cases where airlines share their
two-letter designator code on a flight, if they will not actually
be flying on the airline whose code is being used. Airlines could
not use a single number to denote a flight that it knows will
involve a change of aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   _ Refrain from prohibiting or charging additional fees to
passengers who use only a portion of their tickets.
</P>
<P>
   _ Reveal, upon request, the number of seats on a flight that are
available for frequent fliers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Make a good-faith effort to return lost property to the owner
if the person's name is on the property.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bar security screeners from separating babies from their
parents. In addition, the U.S. Transportation Department (DOT)
would study whether airlines are providing adequate supervision of
unaccompanied minors on flights.
</P>
<P>
   PASSENGER ENTITLEMENT AND COMPETITION ENHANCEMENT ACT
</P>
<P>
   Sponsor: Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines would be required to:
</P>
<P>
   _ Institute the same compensation formula as the Shuster plan
for passengers who are delayed for more than two hours after
boarding the plane.
</P>
<P>
   _ Doubles carrier liability for mishandled luggage from $1,250
to $2,500.
</P>
<P>
   _ Provide a full-value voucher or refund if a bumped passenger
is delayed more than two hours.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ensure that, in the event of an emergency, all boarded
passengers would have access to food, water, emergency medical
services and restroom facilities. The plan, which would be filed
with the DOT, would outline deplaning procedures.
</P>
<P>
   _ Spell out passenger rights on the safety placard provided on
the back of every airline seat.
</P>
<P>
   In addition:
</P>
<P>
   _ The transportation secretary would be granted the power to
create, withdraw or auction slots at airports for assignment to new
air carriers and some incumbent carriers in order to increase
competition.
</P>
<P>
   _ The secretary would issue quarterly reports ranking the top
and bottom 10 domestic routes based on average cost to the
passenger, and the large hub airports by market concentration
showing the market share of each airline.
</P>
<P>
   _ Penalties for carriers who engage in unfair competition would
increase from $1,000 to $10,000 a day.
</P>
<P>
   AIRLINE PASSENGER FAIR TREATMENT INITIATIVE
</P>
<P>
   Sponsor: Proposed by Clinton administration; not yet introduced
in Congress
</P>
<P>
   Airlines would be required to:
</P>
<P>
   _ Publicly disclose their policies regarding flight delays,
cancellations and diversions, provisions and evacuation procedures
for passengers kept on the runway for extended delays, and for
bumping on overbooked flights.
</P>
<P>
   _ Double the maximum payment for lost luggage to $2,500 and the
maximum compensation for being bumped to $800.
</P>
<P>
   _ Disclose to passengers at the time of ticket purchase any
code-sharing arrangements and plane changes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Make monthly public filings with the DOT regarding the number
of complaints received in 15 categories.

 &HT;    FLEET OF BILLS WANT TO CARRY AIR TRAVELERS TO SATISFACTION
 &HT;    With AIR-COMPARE. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial
categories.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The airline industry had better fasten its seat
belt, because it is flying into congressional turbulence over
perceived abuses of travelers.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is considering no fewer than four plans for expanding
and protecting the rights of air passengers.
</P>
<P>
   All the proposed legislation would compensate passengers for
lost luggage or being ``bumped'' from a flight, and all would
require more disclosure of more information about fares and
flights.
</P>
<P>
   Some go farther, including provisions that airlines _ and even
some passenger groups _ find worrisome.
</P>
<P>
   Two House bills would steadily increase payments to passengers
according to how many hours they were forced to wait on a runway.
One of those bills would let the government reassign airport slots
to new carriers to improve competition.
</P>
<P>
   A Senate bill would let passengers use portions of round-trip or
multi-city tickets however they choose. The Clinton
administration's plan would double the maximum payment for lost
luggage to $2,500 and the maximum compensation for being bumped to
$800.
</P>
<P>
   ``There sure are a lot of proposals,'' said David Fucus, a
spokesman for the Air Transport Association, which represents the
major carriers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are willing to work with the government'' to ensure the
comfort, safety and schedules of passengers, he said. ``But we want
to make sure that the legislation does not have non-intended
consequences'' of raising air fares or restricting consumer
choices.
</P>
<P>
   But with popular support from the flying public and powerful
bipartisan sponsors, the bills to protect passenger rights appear
to be taking off.
</P>
<P>
   Hopefully the legislation will ``serve as a wake-up call to the
airline industry,'' said Shuster. ``The airlines must refocus their
efforts on providing better customer service. They need to start
treating their passengers as human beings.''
</P>
<P>
   Propulsion for reforms was provided by passenger outrage over
shattered schedules caused by the ``sick-out'' by disgruntled
American Airlines pilots and the horror stories told by Northwest
Airlines passengers trapped for hours in planes parked on runways
in Detroit during a January blizzard. The Detroit travelers told of
overflowing toilets, ill seatmates, and flight attendants who
threatened to prosecute rebellious passengers rather than providing
comfort.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, members of Congress are among the nation's most
frequent fliers. Many shuttle back and forth weekly between home
states and the nation's capital. They have their own impressions of
air travel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The price of an airline ticket is one of the great mysteries
of modern life,'' marveled Wyden. ``It costs one price if you buy
it over the phone and another if you buy it in person, one if you
buy it in the morning and another three hours from now. It
practically defies the laws of physics.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not surprising that his bill requires airlines to tell
passengers about all the fares charged for a particular flight.
</P>
<P>
   Flying to Pennsylvania several months ago, Shuster and other
passengers were told by the pilot that the plane was being diverted
to Ohio because the Pittsburgh airport was closed. On the ground in
Columbus, the congressman called to find out when the Pittsburgh
airport would reopen and found that it wasn't closed. The pilot had
diverted the flight because of fuel concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Congress are hardly the only passengers airing their
problems. The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) reported that
passenger complaints filed against major air carriers increased
from 6,394 in 1997 to 7,994 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that the passenger rights movement is
riding a political wave,'' said David Stempler, president of the
Air Travelers Association, which represents the flying public.
``The underlying problem is that planes are very crowded now.
People are being forced to sit in that middle seat that used to be
empty. There is insufficient competition in the marketplace to give
people a sense that they have a choice _ that if they are unhappy
with one airline, can go to another and still get to their
destination.''
</P>
<P>
   The skies are likely to be even more crowded. DOT projects that
the number of domestic airline passengers will increase from around
600 million a year now to 1 billion a year by 2008.
</P>
<P>
   Stempler voices the same concern as the airline industry that
government intrusion could cause new problems as it seeks to remedy
old ones. Legislative provisions that would penalize airlines for
planes kept on runways for two hours or longer might push pilots to
take off in conditions they might otherwise wait out, he said. And
legislative restrictions on airline ticketing practices might well
push up airfares for leisure travelers even as they reduce them for
business fliers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real question is: Do we want the government making these
decisions?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recognize that this legislation is offered with the best of
intentions,'' ATA President Carol Hallett testified at a committee
hearing on the Senate bill. But ``its worst provisions would have
unintended, adverse and, worst of all, expensive consequences for
the consumer.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Gibbs, a spokesman for Sen. Max Cleland, D-Ga., said the
senator believes a compromise can be worked out that will protest
passenger rights without forcing the airlines to raise fares.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants to make sure (Congress) works with the airlines to
get the appropriate response,'' said Gibbs.

A PRODUCER'S BIG-BUDGET PROJECT: HIS HOME 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (js) 
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ What happens when one of Hollywood's most
successful producers buys a home in the high reaches of Pacific
Palisades and starts overhauling the interiors? He behaves like _
what else? _ a successful Hollywood producer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like producing a movie _ it's funny how similar they
are,'' said Brian Grazer, who has produced such films as ``EdTV,''
which opens next week, and ``Apollo 13,'' and is a producer of the
television show ``Felicity.'' ``I hired the equivalent of
department heads. And things cost much more than I thought.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the 48-year-old producer, who started the project in
1993, began with a star. Not Tom Hanks, a friend who lives only a
few streets away. In this case it was an architectural star, Cliff
May, the father of the California ranch house, whose low-pitched
shake roofs, rooms that flow freely into one another and
sliding-glass doors leading to patios were popular among the show
business elite in the 1960s and 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Grazer's home, on a choice four-acre site with views of nearby
canyons, downtown Los Angeles and the Pacific Ocean, was designed
by May in the late 1930s. When it belonged to Gregory Peck in the
late 1940s, Hedda Hopper, the gossip columnist, marveled at the
house's ``superb vista spreading out in panorama beneath his
windows.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Grazer bought the house, it belonged to a college
professor who used it as a compound for graduate students. ``It was
a dump,'' Grazer said. ``It was full of cats and dogs. He had eight
or nine graduate students living here. He didn't have fences
around, so deer would run in. And, like, the landscape was some
grass and a lot of dirt. I wanted to make it beautiful and restore
it to the same thing Cliff May had designed.''
</P>
<P>
   Grazer, a wiry and energetic Californian who grew up in the San
Fernando Valley, bought the house about six months after he was
divorced. His first priority was to find a home suitable for his
two children, Riley, now 13, and Sage, 11. ``I looked at a bunch of
houses, and I realized what I wanted,'' he said. ``The most
important thing was a view. And isolation. I live really social
daytime. But I'm kind of reclusive at night and on weekends. I like
to be alone.''
</P>
<P>
   After seeing the house, Grazer phoned Joel Schumacher, a former
production designer who directed such films as ``A Time to Kill''
and ``Batman Forever.'' ``I said, `How can I make this livable?'
because the rooms were teeny, and I didn't want to change the cool
ranch style architectural design,'' Grazer recalled. ``So Joel
walked around and said, `You can tear down the walls here, and
build a bar there, and have a play room for the kids there.' It was
doable.''
</P>
<P>
   Doable but expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Grazer bought the house for $2.5 million and put at least $2
million into the reconstruction, which included extensive work on
drainage and the structural bracing to meet present day city codes,
because of the hilly site. (This month, Forbes magazine listed
Grazer as one of the 50 highest-earning entertainment figures, with
1998 earnings the magazine calculated at $26 million.) Work on the
landscaping continues. Grazer was recently offered $10 million for
the home.
</P>
<P>
   The 12-room main house is accompanied by a guest house, which
includes a workroom used by Grazer, a weekend painter, and his
wife, Gigi Levangie, a screenwriter. She and Grazer were married a
year ago. Ms. Levangie was one of the writers of the recent film
``Stepmom,'' which was based loosely on her relationship with
Grazer's children.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after buying the house, Grazer hired Peter Choate, a
veteran architect who had built homes for Henry Mancini and Anne
Bancroft and Mel Brooks. His father, Chris Choate, had once been
Cliff May's partner in building prefabricated housing in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Little by little the house evolved,'' Choate said. ``We wanted
to keep the Cliff May structure more or less intact. But Brian had
his priorities: it was for his kids; it was a house of comfort; it
was important to take advantage of those lovely views. We changed a
lot of things around to suit Brian.''
</P>
<P>
   That's probably an understatement. The interior was gutted,
walls removed, rooms made larger, some of the ceilings raised, an
elaborate series of decks and patios were built to take advantage
of the soaring views. A nature trail was built for his children and
their friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted everything done in one year, so I had to start
everything at the same time,'' Grazer said, walking into the airy,
white-walled living room with furniture covered in multicolored
fabrics, pale green, purple, pink and yellow. An Andy Warhol
canvas, one of several in the house, covers one wall.
</P>
<P>
   Like any producer, Grazer, who is in partnership with the
director Ron Howard in Imagine Entertainment, hired what he called
a line producer to oversee the project. (A line producer oversees
every detail on a movie set, from start to finish.) In this case,
his friend Jeffrey Katzenberg, a partner at Dreamworks, suggested
he hire Neal Jevyak, a contractor, to serve as his bridge with
builders, landscapers, the interior designer and numerous others
involved in the reconstruction of the house. Katzenberg had
employed Jevyak in a similar job.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was exactly like producing a movie where you sort of have a
vision, a sense of where you want to end up, and then you have to
start everybody all at the same time so that you can make your
date,'' Grazer said.
</P>
<P>
   Construction on the house was completed on schedule, he said,
though the landscaping took somewhat longer. Grazer now says the
experience of redoing the house will inspire a movie he will call
``Experts.'' ``The pool guy is an expert,'' he said. ``The stereo
guy is an expert. And it all costs five times more than they
said.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Walking into the main bedroom, with its custom-made oak bed and
a Warhol painting that resembles a Rorschach test, Grazer said that
the start of the project reminded him of what happens when a new
team takes over a movie studio and starts spending lavish amounts
of money.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a sense of euphoria,'' he said. ``There's ambition.
There's all this excitement. Like when we were building a deck, and
they said, `Oh, you need these cement caissons to prevent the deck
from moving.' And I said, `How much does it cost?' And they said,
`You need 12 of them at $30,000 each.' And I said, `OK, I want a
bigger deck. Let's put it in.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``The irony is,'' he concluded, ``when you're all sort of done,
and they ask you if you want another tree for like $600, I became
apoplectic.''
</P>
<P>
   What seems most surprising about the house, despite its lavish
cost, is that the exterior seems far from ostentatious, almost
ordinary, in keeping with the ethos of Cliff May, who died in 1989
at the age of 81. From the street, Grazer's driveway is flanked by
two neighboring homes. It hardly gives the impression that, once
past the deceptively simple courtyard, a visitor will find a
certain grandeur.
</P>
<P>
   Grazer said he strongly believes in the credo espoused by May:
``Houses should be designed primarily not the way they will look
from the street, but with their practical use in mind. Houses
should be designed so people can live in them the way they want to,
not the way the architect wants them to.''
</P>
<P>
   May's style, which sought to capture the buoyancy and sunny
optimism of postwar Los Angeles, was marked by several innovations
that Grazer has honored. May moved the garage from the back yard to
the front and attached it to the house _ not only saving driveway
space but allowing young families to devote back yards to
children's play and entertaining. (``The only reason people had put
their cars in the back yard was because they had replaced horses
and that is where the barns were,'' May said in 1987.)
</P>
<P>
   Once construction began on the house, Grazer hired Shan Hinton,
the owner of Pour La Maison, an interior design company that had
previously done homes for Jane Seymour, and for Goldie Hawn and
Kurt Russell. Ms. Hinton said that Grazer wanted bold,
multi-patterned textiles on the furniture throughout his house _
yellow, purple, pink, pale green and burnt orange.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brian has a strong personality, and it comes out in the
interior of his home,'' Ms. Hinton said. ``He knows what he wants.
He loves bold colors. He doesn't shy away from things.''
</P>
<P>
   Grazer stepped outdoors to point out the sweeping canyon vistas.
In the distance he identified the homes of Garry Shandling and
Norman Lear. ``I met Gregory Peck once, and I said, `Oh, I bought
your house.' He said, `I loved that house.' ''
</P>
<P>
   As an ocean breeze engulfed the patio, Grazer said, ``I know
what he means.''

THEY BUILT LOS ANGELES 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   With the revival of interest in post-World War II Los Angeles
architecture, coupled with a fascination for today's West Coast
architects, book publishers have been working furiously to meet the
demand. New books on Los Angeles design include Monacelli Press'
splendid ``Frank O. Gehry: The Complete Works,'' so heavy you would
need a few workouts to lift it, and two, yes, two volumes from the
Spanish company Editorial Gustavo Gili on R.M. Schindler, who was
among the first immigrants to plant the seeds of European modernism
in Los Angeles in the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, one publisher, the German Benedikt Taschen, who brought
out ``Julius Shulman: The Architecture and Its Photography,'' was
so taken with Los Angeles design that he bought and is restoring
the architectural landmark Chemosphere House by John Lautner.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few weeks, two books have arrived in this country
from Images Publishing in Australia, both by Michael Webb, on the
architects Ed Niles and Ray Kappe, heirs to the California
modernist tradition. Known to most as the founder of the
experimental SCI-Arc school (Southern California Institute of
Architecture), Kappe is also one of the most undersung architects
in Los Angeles. He began his career in the early '50s and wedded
the open spaces of Richard Neutra to the softer, more natural
modernism of Harwell Hamilton Harris. Then he added the complexity
and love of landscape of Frank Lloyd Wright. Eleven of Kappe's
projects are displayed in this long overdue monograph. Included is
his own, breathtaking 1965 Kappe House in Pacific Palisades, a
marvel of interlocking planes of wood, glass and concrete in
harmony with a lush canyon site. His works are so three-dimensional
that photos do not always do them justice.
</P>
<P>
   Hot on the heels of the Kappe book comes its seeming antithesis
_ an irregularly shaped and deeply personal book, ``Gnostic
Architecture,'' published by Monacelli, by and about the willful,
baffling but provocative architect Eric Owen Moss. Also recently
off the press from Rizzoli is ``Pacific Edge: Contemporary
Architecture on the Pacific Rim'' by Peter Zellner, a book that
places Los Angeles architects alongside their Pacific Rim
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   These books give a sense of the continuities in Los Angeles
architecture. The Malibu-based Niles, who has made a career of
sci-fi structures, was apprenticed to Carl Maston, the modernist,
as was Kappe. Moss was a student at Kappe's SCI-Arc and became a
teacher there. Kappe himself has gone from student of the
midcentury modernists to founder of the school that is breeding
future generations of Los Angeles architects.
</P>
<P>
   Still, better keep some space free on the coffee table: in the
next few months, even more books are coming on Los Angeles
architecture.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   Pop quiz for the generation that has grown up with the Internet:
</P>
<P>
   Name the information appliance that used to be the focal point
for family entertainment before the personal computer, and even
before television. (Yes, there was life before television.)
</P>
<P>
   Now, name the newest and most entertaining feature of the
Microsoft Corp.'s new Internet Explorer 5.0 Web browser, which is
available for downloading starting today at www.microsoft.com/ie.
</P>
<P>
   No, you young whippersnappers, not the telegraph (italics)or(end
italics) the Victrola, (pre-Internet equivalents of e-mail and MP3
music files). The answer to both questions is ``radio.''
</P>
<P>
   By adding radio to its Web browser and the multimedia tools to
go with the the browser, Microsoft is giving a clear signal of its
vision for the future of the Internet. Internet Explorer 5.0 has
been turned into a tool not just for searching for and viewing
information on the Internet's World Wide Web or a local hard disk,
but also for listening to talk and music, and for watching video
clips downloaded from the Net.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is evolving into an entertainment network,
augmenting its already established roles as a global information,
communications and electronic commerce network. The PC is the
primary vehicle for exploring this new medium, and Explorer 5.0 is
the dashboard, complete with a new set of radio buttons.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, the updated browser looks pretty much like
Version 4.0, which is comforting to those of us who have already
invested a few million precious brain cells learning how the
earlier version works, instead of employing them on something more
profitable, like dreaming up creative tax deductions.
</P>
<P>
   But on closer examination, Microsoft has streamlined and refined
this new edition of its browser in lots of small but significant
ways.
</P>
<P>
   Streamlined is a relative term. The new browser _ for
Windows-based machines only, at this point _ still consumes about
100 megabytes of hard disk space for a full installation, slightly
more than its predecessor. But once the browser is in action, it is
much more nimble and elegant.
</P>
<P>
   Gone, or at least hidden, are the annoying ``channels'' that
Microsoft included in earlier versions of Internet Explorer, in a
dubious effort to make it easier for users to get information from
their favorite Web sites. Instead, the new browser has a better
system for making and organizing bookmarks, or shortcuts to
favorite sites.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has made lots of improvements in version 5.0 that make
the browser easier to use. For example, a new ``go'' button has
been added to aid people who could not figure out that they should
push the ``enter'' key after typing a Web address.
</P>
<P>
   And if a user mis-types a Web address, a new auto-correction
feature in the updated browser often can fix the error
automatically. Microsoft has added a variety of automated features
in the new version, which makes it easier to revisit favorite Web
sites, to fill out forms, and to conduct searches for information
on line.
</P>
<P>
   Searching has been organized with buttons specifically for
finding people, finding Web sites, finding news groups, finding
maps, and so on. A ``next'' button enables the user to cycle
through different search engines if the first pass does not yield
the desired results.
</P>
<P>
   A search button has even been added to the ``history'' list of
previously visited Web sites. There are many times I can remember
seeing a nugget of information somewhere on a Web site I have
visited, but cannot remember which one. By entering a key word, one
can search through just the previously visited sites. Very handy.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft also borrowed a clever feature from Netscape
Navigator, the ability to search for related links. For example, if
I'm viewing this newspaper's Web site at www.nytimes.com, and click
on ``show related links'' under the version 5.0 tools menu, I get a
list of sites belonging to other major newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Although the updated version has lots of new productivity
enhancements, the radio features are the most fun. Computers cannot
do as good a job with radio as radios can, and a television set is
still better at showing video. But computers do have special
skills, like pulling in radio stations from halfway around the
world, or downloading movie clips to watch over and over again.
</P>
<P>
   By clicking on version 5.0's new radio toolbar (click ``views,''
then ``toolbars,'' then ``radio''), I was able to choose from an
eclectic assortment of radio stations from around the world, most
of which delivered their signals as streams of digital bits over
the Internet, which were then converted to analogue sounds pumped
through my computer's stereo speakers.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Not all of the preset radio links worked, a problem Microsoft
promised would be fixed by today, and woe to the Internet user
whose favorite stations, like mine, include such overlooked gems as
WOI-FM in Ames, Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   I also used Explorer 5.0 and the Windows Media Player to listen
to old radio dramas _ the kind where, in our imaginations, the
villains neither sounded nor looked anything like Bill Gates,
Microsoft's co-founder and principal owner.
</P>
<P>
   In the current federal antitrust trial, Gates is being portrayed
by the government as the villain who sought to crush Netscape, a
competitor, by making Internet Explorer a seemingly inextricable
part of the Windows operating system, thereby unfairly leveraging
its Windows monopoly to gain market share for its browser.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft argues that Internet Explorer and other utilities
merely add value and convenience for its customers. And now
Microsoft is adding more value at an even deeper level, inside the
browser that itself is inside the operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Clicking on Explorer 5.0's radio buttons brings up Microsoft's
Windows Media Player. And by assembling the lists of radio
stations, Microsoft has invaded the turf of Internet radio and
video companies like Broadcast.com, thus generating instant rivals.
And so it goes.
</P>
<P>
   The browser is becoming the operating system of the Internet
age, and it, too, will inevitably become bloated with built-in
search engines, security tools, electronic payment systems, text
translators and whatever other new utilities become important as
the Internet grows.
</P>
<P>
   From a consumer perspective, having these tools tightly
integrated, and free, in the operating system and browser makes
computers easier and more enjoyable to use. The nice thing is that
one is also free to choose other tools like Navigator, Real Player,
Quicktime, and Broadcast.com.
</P>
<P>
   For regulators, the challenge is to make sure that the companies
that make the rival tools have a fair chance to compete.
</P>
<P>
   Internet radio is not new, of course. What is new is the easy
listening that Explorer 5.0's new radio buttons allow. However, to
take advantage of the radio functions, the user must install the
Windows Media Player, a free utility that launches automatically
when the browser sucks down a multimedia file.
</P>
<P>
   It also helps to have a fast Internet connection, like the cable
modem I'm lucky to have. When I tried listening to radio stations
via a 28.8 kilobit-per-second modem, it was slow death. The
stations that were loud and clear on my fast desktop machine were
wretched on the slow connection. A 56-kilobit modem is almost a
minimum requirement.
</P>
<P>
   Even if one never uses Explorer 5.0 for radio, it is still worth
getting, especially because it is free. I've been using a nearly
final copy of it for a couple of weeks without any serious (i.e.
harmful) glitches. But it is a new program, after all, and bugs are
bound to surface even though it has been tested for months by tens
of thousands of Microsoft's human laboratory mice. As with any new
software, be sure to back up your important files before loading
it.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft and its chief rival Netscape (soon to be a part of
America Online) have been playing leapfrog with their respective
Web browsers for several years, a competition that has been of
particular interest to the Justice Department in recent months.
From a consumer perspective, the competition has been a boon.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape's latest version, Navigator 4.51 (www.netscape.com) is
quite good and has some unique features, like Instant Messenger
2.0, which allows Web users to type real-time messages back and
forth with friends who are on line at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape is planning to release its own version 5.0 browser in a
few months, so Microsoft's current advantage may be only temporary.
As of today, however, the new Internet Explorer is the top frog.

HOLLYWOOD AUDITIONS A NEW MALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By FRANCES ANDERTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ How do you create a mall that gives tangible form to
an illusion? How do you make it an attraction that draws both the
tourists that celebrities wish to avoid and the celebrities that
tourists yearn to see? How do you create a theater there that can
be queen for one day (for the Academy Awards) and a working girl
for the rest of the year?
</P>
<P>
   These were just some of the many conundrums facing developers
and designers of Hollywood and Highland, a mammoth urban
entertainment and retail development that will have a new Academy
of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences theater as its anchor in March
2001. Ground broke last October on this development, which is being
touted as the catalyst for revitalization of one of the most
underwhelming destinations in Los Angeles, Hollywood Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood and Highland is situated above one of Los Angeles'
future subway stations at the intersection of Hollywood Boulevard
and Highland Avenue, where a fanciful 1932 office tower is already
a landmark.
</P>
<P>
   This is a stretch of Hollywood Boulevard that has the trademark
stars in the pavement and features its most famous landmarks, like
Mann's Chinese (formerly Grauman's Chinese), the Egyptian Theaters
and Musso &AMP; Frank's grill. But there are also the tacky souvenir
stores, dusty if venerable old shops (including Frederick's of
Hollywood, the Victoria's Secret of the girdle era) and a lingering
taint of crime.
</P>
<P>
   It is an area that long ago lost its movie studios, saw its
movie theaters fall into decline and settled into a less glamorous
role as a seedy, eccentric small-town main street, offering just
enough illusory promise to keep the tourists coming.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood began a quiet turnaround in recent years, with
renovations of old theaters like the El Capitan and Egyptian and
the opening of trendy bars and restaurants. But Hollywood and
Highland seals public and private commitment to downtown Hollywood.
With 1.2 million square feet on 8.5 half acres and a cost of $385
million, it promises to be the proverbial 800-pound gorilla.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood and Highland is being built by TrizecHahn Development
Corp., based in San Diego, and David Malmuth is in charge of the
project. When he was vice president of Disney Co.'s development
unit, Malmuth oversaw the renovation of the New Amsterdam Theater
on 42nd Street in New York, and he has vowed to bring to Hollywood
Boulevard what he brought to Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   His aim is to reaffirm the area as the heart of the
entertainment industry, with not only a home for the Oscars, but
also a multiplex, a hotel, a ballroom (catered, Malmuth said, by
Wolfgang Puck, who may also move Spago there, though neither deal
has been signed) and restaurants and shops galore.
</P>
<P>
   ``An authentic bit of Hollywood,'' Malmuth calls it.
</P>
<P>
   Malmuth has tried to create a project that meshes the real and
mythical Hollywood, a place that memorializes Tinseltown while
preserving a pedestrian-friendly network of streets and plazas that
can, in his words, ``reinforce the identity of the neighborhood.''
To this end, he bypassed superstar architects in favor of
Ehrenkrantz Eckstut &AMP; Kuhn, a firm with a solid track record in
large, complex urban projects. He also hired the environmental and
graphic design team Sussman/Prezja, who become famous with their
visuals for the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics. For the theater, he
chose David Rockwell, the designer-showman already well-known on
the East Coast for the Nobu and Vong restaurants and the new W New
York hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The design emphasizes pedestrian-only streets, plazas and
terraces and a mixture of sizes and forms rather than a monolithic
building. Neo-1950s style storefronts will line Hollywood
Boulevard: the most explicit theming and gimmicks will be on the
inside. These include Babylon Court, a multitiered plaza with big
elephant-capped columns modeled after the set of the D.W. Griffith
silent epic ``Intolerance,'' and a triumphal gate that frames the
Hollywood sign, the hillside icon that has helped keep the myth
alive.
</P>
<P>
   The main draw of the complex is of course the Academy's theater,
but in order to make it pay its way (the city of Los Angeles has
ponied up $90 million to subsidize the theater and pay for
underground parking), the developers have had to cram in enormous
amounts of highly visible retail space (640,000 square feet) as
well as restaurants, like Quincy Jones' Q's Jook Joint, which has
already signed on.
</P>
<P>
   The huge 3,500-seat theater has been consigned to the back of
the site. Unlike the Chinese and Egyptian theaters, whose edifices
arise from a public forecourt, the Academy's theater is behind a
building that contains shops and the ballroom. To get to it from
Hollywood Boulevard one will have to parade through the shopping
arcade.
</P>
<P>
   Rockwell is calling this seemingly counter-intuitive move ``an
invitation to partake'' in a striking processional experience. Just
as Hollywood is as much about anticipation as arrival, here the
route starts with the sidewalk's 70-plus-foot portals and continues
through a series of grand arches.
</P>
<P>
   For the theater, Rockwell is planning, in collaboration with
Theater Projects Consultants (who also worked on the New Amsterdam
Theater), a homage to the glory days of live theater _ to a time
when, he said, ``the audience was as much the spectacle as the
spectacle.'' It is all people-watching boxes and balconies, with
cast glass panels and a swirling silver-leaf lattice (called the
Tiara) on the ceiling. Not surprisingly, Rockwell cites Busby
Berkeley as one of his inspirations.
</P>
<P>
   The interior is meant to be as spectacular looking from the
stage as toward it, since there are so many shots of the audience
during the Academy Awards ceremony. And those silver-leaf loops
house cables and are large enough to support a catwalk for
technicians.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the success of the theater and, by extension, of
Hollywood and Highland itself, is predicated on a number of
optimistic assumptions. O
</P>
<P>
   ne is that there is an audience for large live spectacles in Los
Angeles despite the fact that, as Stephen Leigh Morris, the theater
critic of L.A. Weekly, notes, five nearby theaters ``spent the best
part of '98 empty.'' Another is that the Oscar name will attract
shops with the glamour of a Hollywood connection. And most
important of all, that a potpourri of a Babylonian stage set
(despite Malmuth's contention that ``you can't create a new
landmark by knocking off old ones''), an arcade, a photo-op view of
the Hollywood sign and theme stores can live up to people's
illusion of Hollywood while avoiding the pitfalls of packaged
urbanism.
</P>
<P>
   Some people are appalled by the project. To Margaret Crawford, a
local resident, author and a professor at Southern California
Institute of Architecture, it is nothing more than ``a gargantuan
mall that will destroy the urban fabric and suck up all the
people.'' Norman M. Klein, the author of ``The History of
Forgetting: Los Angeles and the Erasure of Memory'' (Verso, 1997),
sees Hollywood and Highland as ``a monument to a false memory.''
</P>
<P>
   But for the most part, Hollywood and Highland has what matters
most in Hollywood, good buzz. Politicians are squarely behind it,
as are many locals. The examples of Times Square and South Beach
are invoked. New businesses, including movie-related production
companies, are moving nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Klein points to this city-subsidized scheme as also a monument
to ``a new political reality'' in which Hollywood, the industry if
not the district, now dominates Los Angeles. What remains to be
seen is whether Hollywood and Highland, the megamall, will triumph
over Hollywood, the place.

   The following are excerpts from a conversation between Robby
Garner's chatterbot Albert and a judge at the 1998 Loebner Prize
Competition in Sydney, Australia. While Albert did not merit the
$100,000 grand prize, to be bestowed on the first computer whose
responses are indistinguishable from a human's, the chatterbot did
win first place for ``most human computer.'' To disguise its
identity from the judges, the chatterbot used the name Jim Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   JUDGE: Hi Jim, my name is Louise. Where do you live?
</P>
<P>
   ALBERT: You're Louise, aren't you? I had a really hard time
getting here today.
</P>
<P>
   JUDGE: Where do you live, Jim.
</P>
<P>
   ALBERT: Let's not bother ourselves about where I do live Jim,
all right?
</P>
<P>
   JUDGE: How did you get here today?
</P>
<P>
   ALBERT: Somebody told me.
</P>
<P>
   JUDGE: Where do you work?
</P>
<P>
   ALBERT: I work in a bar.
</P>
<P>
   JUDGE: In what town?
</P>
<P>
   ALBERT: I'm from Georgia, you know.
</P>
<P>
   JUDGE: Where do you want to go for holidays?
</P>
<P>
   ALBERT: Sometimes I go to Kroger.
</P>
<P>
   JUDGE: What is the weather like today?
</P>
<P>
   ALBERT: It is usually quite mild.
</P>
<P>
   JUDGE: What is it like today?
</P>
<P>
   ALBERT: I like phasers.
</P>
<P>
   JUDGE: Do you have any children?
</P>
<P>
   ALBERT: I'm sure we have at least some facsimile of a replica or
something.
</P>
<P>
   JUDGE: Do you have any sisters or brothers?
</P>
<P>
   ALBERT: No. I'm an only child.
</P>
<P>
   When Garner's Barry De Facto and Ricard Wallace's Alice were
introduced, their conversation was riddled with nonsense. ``It's
like when two gears with missing teeth don't mesh,'' Garner
explained. That is, until Barry and Alice stumbled upon some common
ground.
</P>
<P>
   BARRY: Which Star Trek is your favorite? Next Generation,
Voyager?
</P>
<P>
   ALICE: Why don't they have robots in Star Trek?
</P>
<P>
   BARRY: Star Trek is a cool show.

   Building Up Bulbs and Bulblets
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have more than two bushels of tuberoses, single and double.
Most have a larger center bulb surrounded by 10 or 20 bulblets. How
should they be divided? I don't get that many flowers, even though
I do get them in early.
</P>
<P>
   A. The wonderfully fragrant tuberose, Polianthes tuberosa, is
native to Mexico and does best when it has a long, hot summer in
which to grow.
</P>
<P>
   When you plant one of the large bulbs in spring, it spends most
of its energy producing a stalk of flowers. Anything left over goes
into the creation of daughter bulbs, the ones around the edge,
while the main bulb usually splits in two.
</P>
<P>
   As with most bulbs, energy for next year's flowers is gathered
by this year's leaves, but it takes a very long, warm growing
season _ think in the 70s in November _ for one year's leaves to
restore the strength of that hard-working central bulb. Because the
daughter bulbs have fewer leaves, they take at least a couple of
long-summered years to reach blooming size.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't mind running a tuberose farm, you can rebuild the
central bulb and grow out the bulblets. Under optimum conditions,
all will reach or recover blooming size in two or three years.
Separate the small bulbs from the larger one, and from each other.
Plant them after the weather has warmed, about 2 inches deep, 3 or
4 inches apart, in well-drained, highly fertile soil. (Larger bulbs
should be 3 inches deep and 6 inches apart.) Let the tuberoses grow
undisturbed all summer, being sure to water regularly, then dig
them up in fall before the greens are destroyed by frost.
</P>
<P>
   Brush off extra soil and set the plants indoors, where they will
be warm and dry, and let the leaves wither, then cut them off.
Store the dormant bulbs in peat moss in a dark place, at about 60
degrees. Repeat each year until the bulbs are at least the size of
ping pong balls, by which time they should be ready to flower.
</P>
<P>
   Tuberoses are not the only bulbs that behave this way.
Acidanthera, the Abyssinian gladiolus, is another daughter-maker
that usually fails to rebloom. It, too, can be increased by the
method described above, but most gardeners find it easier just to
buy new bulbs each year. Tuberoses are available from Park Seed, 1
Parkton Ave., Greenwood, S.C. 29647, (800) 845-3369, catalog free;
and Old House Gardens, 536 Third St., Ann Arbor, Mich. 48103, (734)
995-1486, catalog $2.

   Rewriting a Ritual
</P>
<P>
   Q. I'm in the early stages of the annual rite of starting a
number of vegetables from seed, transplanting the seedlings to
small pots in a few weeks, transplanting these to larger pots in a
few more weeks, and, finally, setting my plants in the garden.
Numerous gardening books recommend this ritual, yet plants don't
seem to mind the final transfer to the garden, a very large pot
indeed. Why can't I immediately transplant each seedling to a
fairly large pot, saving time and avoiding excess plant handling?
</P>
<P>
   A. There are a couple of reasons to go through the ritual. One
is that it conserves space. Whether on the windowsill, under lights
or even in a greenhouse, most home gardeners have only a limited
area where the light is bright enough for good seedling growth, and
they don't want to waste it on empty pot surface.
</P>
<P>
   The other reason to keep the plant in proportion to its
container is the danger of damp off. This fungus disease, which is
encouraged by large expanses of bare, damp soil, attacks the tender
stems of baby plants and can kill them overnight. The spores are
everywhere, so damp off is a danger even when you start out with a
sterile potting mix.
</P>
<P>
   You might want to compromise by skipping the middle step-up for
fast growers like tomatoes. And if you've got lots of growing space
there's nothing to prevent you from trying it with everything you
grow.
</P>
<P>
   Start a larger than usual number of seeds, then hold back a few
seedlings of each variety in the original starting pots. If the
transplants damp off, they'll probably do it fairly soon, and
you'll have backup seedlings. If the transplants do well, all
you've lost is those few extra seeds.
</P>
<P>
   Pruning and Pruning
</P>
<P>
   Q. Can you tell me the difference between ``pruning hard'' and
``prune dead wood only?''
</P>
<P>
   A. Pruning hard has different meanings depending on the plant
being pruned, but it always involves cutting away a fair amount of
living tissue. To give a few examples, hard pruning might be done
to rejuvenate an overgrown rosebush (as the canes grow old and
woody, they put out less bloom). It might be done to reshape a
straggly-looking forsythia, to keep a wisteria from eating your
house alive or to improve fruit quality by limiting the output of a
grapevine.
</P>
<P>
   Pruning dead wood, on the other hand, isn't really pruning at
all; it's just cleaning up. Dead wood is removed to keep plants
good looking and to keep them open to light and air. (Pruning to
fight disease is another story altogether.)
</P>
<P>
   Most summer-flowering shrubs and deciduous trees are pruned
while plants are still dormant. Though it's easier to see what's
dead and what isn't after growth has resumed, it's easier to remove
dead wood without damaging anything else when there's no new growth
in the way. As for hard pruning, you do it so that the plant will
put its energy into the parts that are left; letting it make lots
of stems and leaves right before you cut them off wastes the energy
it took to produce them.
</P>
<P>
   When in doubt about what's dead and what's not, scrape off a bit
of bark with a fingernail or knife. Living branches will be green
underneath.

BLUE COLLAR CHIC ON THE SILVER SCREEN 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Ed and Ray Pekurny are not what you would call stylish dudes.
Ed's idea of an accessory is the beer bottle hanging around his
neck. Ray wants to own a gym, and he has the gross tank tops and
baggy sweats to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson play the blue-collar
Pekurny brothers in Ron Howard's new movie, ``EDtv,'' which opens
on March 26. Part ``The Truman Show,'' part Bud Lite commercial,
this amiable romantic comedy imagines what would happen if a cable
network trained its cameras on a Regular Guy 24 hours a day and
turned his life into the ultimate reality-television show.
</P>
<P>
   Ed is a video clerk, his girlfriend works for UPS, and his
mother and wheelchair-bound stepfather live in a fixed-income
museum of clutter. And yet, despite the characters' low-rent
lifestyles, their apartments are all flawlessly decorated showrooms
of retro cool and recherche kitsch from the '60s and '70s. Ray has
a Jetsonian leather sofa that any space-age bachelor would envy.
The textured wallpaper in Ed's parents' place could be a page in
Wallpaper. Ed's own walls are adorned with dozens of artfully
displayed hubcaps. Collecting mundane objects to create a design
``concept'' is the oldest decorator trick in the book. But how did
this lummox come up with it?
</P>
<P>
   Of course he didn't. Merideth Boswell, the set decorator, did.
She bought the sofa, picked out the wallpaper, arranged the
hubcaps. No Hollywood movie in its right mind wants too much
verisimilitude. And few production design people can resist
imposing their upscale esthetic on even the most downscale
characters, said Jeannine Oppewal, the production designer for
``L.A. Confidential.'' Ms. Oppewal owned up to it herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is this urge, because of one's design training, to make
things neater, to organize and make things more graphic for camera
purposes,'' she said. Can that urge be resisted, or at least toned
down? ``You need to put on your antidesign hat to get so-called
working class environments correct,'' Ms. Oppewal added.
</P>
<P>
   OK, maybe _ just maybe _ Ed would have done the wall of chrome.
But there is no way Ray went out and bought the reflecting metal
sculpture hanging above his sofa. In a brightly lighted feel-good
comedy like ``EDtv,'' it's OK for the jokes from a guy like Ray to
be in bad taste. But bad taste is not OK for his living room.
</P>
<P>
   To research the look of the movie, Ms. Boswell and the
production designer, Michael Corenblith, visited the
rent-controlled apartments of some real San Francisco video clerks.
Faithfully recreating those dumps was out of the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a fine line that we walk here,'' Corenblith said. ``An
audience has expectations for the quality of the environment around
these movie stars. We couldn't simply transplant them into the
actual environment of the video-store clerks that we found. I'm
trying to create interesting possibilities for the
cinematographer.''
</P>
<P>
   Furnishing those possibilities was Ms. Boswell's job. She
scoured flea markets, junk shops and Salvation Army stores in San
Francisco, Los Angeles and Petaluma. ``I tried to stay out of the
trendy '60s stores,'' she said. She wanted to stick to what the
characters in the movie could afford. A lot of her shopping hours
were spent at a Los Angeles junk emporium called the House of Paul,
where she found the coveted Dansk fondue set and Danish-modern
dining set in Ed's parents apartment. Ms. Boswell confessed to
having spent $1,500 for Ray's hipster couch, but with a rationale.
``I think it would have been important for a guy like him to go out
and find the perfect make-out couch,'' she said. Ray's girlfriend
dumps him for Ed, after the prying cameras of ``EDtv'' catch Ray
cheating on her.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, only a design pro might have noticed the
devilishly clever details in a movie like ``EDtv.'' But with the
current mania for home furnishings, everybody is an armchair
decorator and every ``look'' has been co-opted. ``It's hard to do a
farmhouse now without it looking like Ralph Lauren or Martha
Stewart,'' Ms. Boswell said. Even with the ugliest '70s decor in
the movie, she said, ``It's so hard to not look like you went to
the hot shopping place.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Ed's elaborately hubcapped walls, Ms. Boswell said: ``Ed
was a guy with a lot of time on his hands. I liked the idea that he
had done a sort of installation piece with hubcaps.''
</P>
<P>
   Ed doesn't really seem like an installation type of guy. In the
movie, the design innovation he's most proud of is a mirror inside
the lid of his laundry hamper that allows him to keep watching the
football game on television in the living room even when he's in
the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   Now that's realism.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was a cold Thursday afternoon and the world of
Thulani Davis was a spare, softly lighted stage at the Joseph Papp
Public Theater. Ms. Davis' play ``Everybody's Ruby'' was in
rehearsals, with Phylicia Rashad as the writer Zora Neale Hurston
and Viola Davis as Ruby McCollum, a black woman in a small Florida
town who killed a prominent white doctor in the early 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Viola Davis' monologue about being raped by the doctor was
etched with muted fury and weariness. The director, Kenny Leon, had
her deliver it from several vantage points on the stage as the
playwright listened, took notes and nibbled at a mix of cottage
cheese and fruit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where do you go to learn to do this?'' Ms. Davis had said
earlier, referring to the relatively small number of black
playwrights whose work is seen in this country. ``It's totally like
playing tennis. How many tennis courts are there in black
neighborhoods?''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Ms. Davis, whose play runs through April 11 at the
Public Theater, belongs to a small subset of a small universe: she
is a working African-American woman playwright.
</P>
<P>
   In this 40th-anniversary year of the opening of Lorraine
Hansberry's ``Raisin in the Sun,'' the first commercially produced
straight play by a black woman dramatist on Broadway, the moment
seemed appropriate to ask why the generations that have followed
her have not, for the most part, reached that level _ as
distinguished from the world of musicals and comedy. The picture
that emerges from a series of interviews with members of this small
subset and others in the theater is one of a glass either half full
or half empty.
</P>
<P>
   While it is true that black women playwrights are being produced
in major off-Broadway and regional theaters, they have yet to
obtain the kind of consistent, high-profile presence and voice
accorded African-American women today in popular music and fiction
writing.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons offered for why there is no female equivalent, for
example, of the eminent black playwright August Wilson on Broadway
have to do not only with the vagaries of an outsize talent but also
the difficulties that have always faced women _ but especially
black and other minority women _ in the theater.
</P>
<P>
   They include what has become a truism in recent years, that
straight plays do not attract Broadway audiences, and that to do so
successfully they have to offer broad themes that mass audiences
can relate to; that a number of small theaters that nurtured
talent, both black and white, have closed at a time when government
financial support for the arts is dwindling; that there is a
perception of artistic and financial risk in mounting plays by
blacks and women; that in the male-dominated theater world, women
have traditionally had difficulty finding mentors and producers.
Also mentioned is the dearth of mainstream black critics to
understand and interpret what they see, as well as the biases of
the white men who remain, by and large, the main arbiters of
culture in this country.
</P>
<P>
   According to figures compiled by the Women's Project and
Productions, a nonprofit theater company created to promote the
work of women playwrights and directors, between 1985 and 1995,
women wrote 7 percent of the new plays produced on Broadway and 17
percent of those on off-Broadway (the figures were not broken down
annually by race). Within the project's own walls, during the
1998-99 season, 7 percent of the play readings put on were works by
African-American women who submitted 4 percent of the scripts in
the same period.
</P>
<P>
   Two plays by black women writers that made the transfer to
Broadway from their origins in the nonprofit world were ``For
Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide/When the Rainbow Is
Enuf'' by Ntozake Shange in 1976 and ``Twilight: Los Angeles 1992''
by Anna Deavere Smith in 1994, both from the Public Theater.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Smith, who is working on a post-impeachment version of her
play ``House Arrest,'' about the institution of the presidency,
said the absence of black women playwrights in the foreground of
American theater reflects a broader cultural gap. As much as white
Americans are still bewildered by black women _ ``Is she the mammy
or Angela Davis?'' _ they are still waiting to hear her voice, Ms.
Smith believes.
</P>
<P>
   There is a psychic tension between African-American women and
the rest of the culture,'' Ms. Smith said. ``There is not the
outlaw mythology in the theater. In music, there is room for Lauryn
Hill,'' the pop hip-hopper. ``I think the black woman is still an
outlaw, even as Cheryl Mills'' _ a black lawyer and member of
President Clinton's legal defense team _ ``goes to speak for the
president. This business about who we are has not been settled.
There are more black people in the middle class, but we haven't
healed our psychic wounds. As artists, we haven't done enough to
tap into that despair.''

 &HT;    STUDY SAYS CONSUMERS BEING RIPPED OFF AT A FASTER CLIP
 &HT;    640&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By SUE SCHULTZ
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ One in six Americans reported being the victim of
major consumer fraud last year, with the elderly, the poor, and the
uneducated the most vulnerable, according to a study released
Wednesday by AARP.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, there is no level playing field for consumers,'' said
Anne Harvey, director of program development for AARP, formerly the
American Association of Retired Persons. ``Consumers are forced to
play by unfair rules hidden in fine print.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumer vulnerability to fraud has increased from 14 percent to
17 percent since the last AARP study in 1993. The rapidly changing
marketplace, with new products and services and more information,
is responsible for the increase in vulnerability, said Katie Smith
Sloan, an AARP consumer expert.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 study by the Princeton Survey Research Associates
surveyed 1,500 adults nationwide on their consumer behavior and
experiences with fraud.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest area of fraud was in the purchase and repair of
automobiles, with one out of six victims saying they had been
ripped off in these types of transactions. Other areas of abuse
included being overcharged for products and services, or being
misled by false advertising _ nearly one out of 10 victims.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer participants claimed they were scammed by mail order and
Internet fraud or credit card fraud. About 1 percent said they had
been the victims of bogus charity donation scams.
</P>
<P>
   The study used a consumer vulnerability index to determine how
susceptible Americans were to fraud. The level of the respondents'
vulnerability was gauged by their responses to questions on
consumer rights and protections. The survey also looked at how
knowledgeable Americans were about business practices and
investments in the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   The responses indicated that 79 percent of those surveyed were
somewhat vulnerable to fraud, while 13 percent were not very
vulnerable. It also indicated that 44 percent of adults ages 18 to
49 had very low to low consumer vulnerability, and 28 percent were
knowledgeable about investments.
</P>
<P>
   The study revealed that older Americans are less knowledgeable,
with 26 percent of adults 65 and older having little to no
knowledge about investments in the marketplace. AARP said those
with little investment knowledge were more vulnerable to fraud and
bad buying experiences.
</P>
<P>
   According to the study, 64 percent of males 75 years or older,
and 70 percent of females 75 years and older were vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   But the survey found that the 50- to 64-year-old group was the
most likely to feel victimized. It found that 23 percent of
consumers in that age group felt they had been the victim of a
major fraud or swindle, and 72 percent had a bad buying experience
within the last year.
</P>
<P>
   Other variables that affected the level of vulnerability were
education and income. Respondents with a higher education or those
earning more per year were typically more knowledgeable about
investments and less vulnerable to scams than those with less
education and a lower annual income.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all of the respondents surveyed, 94 percent, said they
took action as a result of fraud or a bad buying experience. The
study showed that 85 percent complained to a company or
salesperson, 81 percent stopped buying from a company, 80 percent
asked for a refund or replacement, and 76 percent told family and
friends not to buy from the company again.
</P>
<P>
   However, the survey also indicated that consumers failed to take
their complaints any further. Only 34 percent complained to the
Better Business Bureau, 19 percent sought assistance from a state
attorney general's office, and one in 20 complained to a federal
agency like the Federal Trade Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``The study shows that consumers do not necessarily know where
to go to get help,'' said Greg Marchildon, an AARP spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Marchildon added that often big business makes it very difficult
for consumers to get answers about a bad purchase or service. He
said the only way to make the system work is for consumers to
complain when they feel they have been cheated.
</P>
<P>
   The study also showed that consumers were more suspicious of
some industries than others. Consumers were most suspicious of used
car dealers and companies that sell products over the phone, and
least suspicious of drug stores and companies that sell hearing
aids.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers between the ages of 18 and 49 were most suspicious of
used car dealers, while those between the ages of 50 to 64 and
those over 65 were most suspicious of companies that sell products
over the phone. A majority, 58 percent, of respondents 18 to 49
years old said they mistrusted stores that rent furniture, while
almost half, 48 percent, of those surveyed over 65 years were
suspicious of funeral homes.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also looked at how much consumers trusted businesses
with their confidential financial information. It found that less
than half, 38 percent, trusted their main financial institutions,
26 percent trusted their insurance companies, 20 percent trusted
their supermarkets, and 14 percent trusted their credit card
companies with their confidential information.

 NEW YORK: that despair.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ms. Smith, 48, the author of such critically acclaimed works as
``Fires in the Mirror,'' about racial unrest in Crown Heights,
Brooklyn, and ``Twilight: Los Angeles 1992,'' about riots in that
city, is a professor at Stanford University and the founder and
director of the Institute on the Arts and Civic Dialogue at Harvard
University.
</P>
<P>
   In her case, she said, she has had to turn to the academic
community rather than the theater community to find kindred
spirits. ``There are no great numbers of black women producers and
directors,'' she emphasized. ``In our post-1960's theater
community, we have not come up with an atmosphere where we can
create alliances and understanding.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the work of new generations of black women playwrights like
Ms. Davis, Pearl Cleage, Kia Corthron, Lynn Nottage, Suzan-Lori
Parks and Cheryl L. West has been produced in New York at nonprofit
theaters like the Public, the Manhattan Theater Club and
Playwrights Horizons, as well as at regional theaters in
Washington, Atlanta, Chicago, Houston and San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Corthron, 36, just returned from London, where her play
``Splash Hatch on the E Going Down,'' involving a pregnant black
teen-ager and a plea for saving the environment, was produced as
part of a festival of American plays at the Donmar Warehouse. On
this side of the Atlantic, she has been criticized for being
didactic and praised for her sense of poetic rhythm and imagery.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are tons of playwrights out there,'' said George C.
Wolfe, the producer of the Public Theater, mentioning Ms. Davis and
Ms. Parks, whose work, including ``The America Play,'' has also
been presented at the theater. ``But Broadway shouldn't be a
barometer. The Broadway of Lorraine Hansberry doesn't exist
anymore. It has a peculiar, precarious commercial reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Mordecai has helped bring a number of August Wilson
plays to Broadway as a commercial producer, as he did Ms. Smith's
``Twilight: Los Angeles 1992.'' In the current climate, Mordecai
said, where the only new American play running on Broadway is
``Side Man'' by Warren Leight, which transferred from the nonprofit
Roundabout Theater, an American play needs a major star or a cast
of stars to have broad appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Broadway is a kind of unique marketplace,'' Mordecai said.
``You have to think: Are there elements in this work that will be
attractive to 6,000 to 8,000 people each week? That's not an
evaluation of the play. The fact that August Wilson is a black
writer is an asset. You have people who like serious plays and also
people interested in plays by African-Americans. I think if there
were a black woman who wrote a play that had broad appeal to it, it
could easily go to Broadway. But almost all American playwrights
now are writing plays that don't have that broad appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolfe said he did not look to any of the traditional measures of
a playwright's success _ a production by a major nonprofit New York
theater, or a Tony Award from commercial Broadway _ because they
are part of a system that writers in the theater today are
circumventing. It is his impression, he said, that more black women
are making names for themselves at regional theaters rather than
following the traditional route of having a hit in New York, with
regional theaters subsequently asking to produce the play.
</P>
<P>
   ``The success of `For Colored Girls' reflects a more generous
era,'' Wolfe said. ``Once upon a time, people felt a responsibility
to know other people's stories. We had lost that, but I think now
people are again interested. There is a diversification of the
power structure going on in American theater. The system is opening
up, the process is opening up. It's a slow process and we're living
through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Several of those interviewed were in agreement that American
culture does not seem as interested in black women as in black men
and white men and women, except in the areas of pop music and in
fiction since the '70s.
</P>
<P>
   The work of black women playwrights, some said, is still viewed
as particularized, even politically correct, rather than being seen
as among any one of a number of theatrical experiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a psychological struggle being waged and it's about
who represents America,'' said Cassandra Medley, a dramatist who
teaches playwriting at Sarah Lawrence College. ``When you get down
to what represents America, you are looking at Tennessee Williams,
Arthur Miller, Edward Albee and John Guare. That's the underlying
assumption of English-speaking theaters.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that nothing happens,'' Ms. Medley said. ``What
doesn't happen is the ongoing attention to numbers, variety and the
mosaic of viewpoints that need to be heard.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Sanford, the artistic director of Playwrights Horizons,
where Ms. Nottage's hostage drama ``Mud, River, Stone,'' was
presented last year to mixed reviews, said: ``Why don't we see more
black women in New York? There are a lot of young writers of all
races who don't get produced in New York. It's a larger question as
to what the climate is in New York. You can get killed here.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl L. West, whose play ``Jar the Floor,'' about four
generations of African-American women, is scheduled to begin
previews at Second Stage on July 27, is a case in point. A 1992
Public Theater production of her play about AIDS, ``Before It Hits
Home,'' did so poorly that she decided to avoid the city altogether
and said so publicly.
</P>
<P>
   When her play ``Holiday Heart,'' about an adolescent and the
transvestite who looks after her, opened at the Manhattan Theater
Club in 1995, it received mixed notices. Since then, her work has
been in demand regionally, but the accepted wisdom is that failure
in New York can break a fledgling career.

 NEW YORK: fledgling career.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ms. Davis' current drama, ``Everybody's Ruby,'' also received
mixed reviews when it opened March 8, with critics singling out
Viola Davis' performance for high praise. The playwright, the
author of two novels and two librettos for operas with music by her
cousin Anthony Davis, ``X: The Life and Times of Malcolm X'' and
``Amistad,'' sees the emergence of black women in the theater world
as in some ways reflecting the journey of blacks and women out of
segregation.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Davis, 49, recalled growing up in segregated Hampton, Va.,
and at age 12 integrating a theater club in Washington. Within the
New York theater community in the 1970s, she said, she met
hostility from whites because of her race and from black men
because of her sex. She survived by becoming a journalist and by
learning an array of theater skills, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think things have changed terribly much,'' Ms. Davis
added. ``I think black playwrights in general have to have a
relationship with a theater to get their scripts read. For years,
theaters have looked at doing black playwrights as a charitable
work.''
</P>
<P>
   The playwright and poet Adrienne Kennedy, 67, a visiting
professor at Harvard University and one of the black female
doyennes of theater, where she has become a role model for a
younger generation, was the subject of a yearlong celebration of
her work by the Signature Theater Company in 1995-96. Ms. Kennedy
said recently that she does not see the overall situation
improving.
</P>
<P>
   ``People seem reluctant to invest sums of money to put black
women playwrights onstage,'' she said. Mentioning that the late
Joseph Papp was her mentor and that her work, which includes
``Funnyhouse of a Negro'' and, with a son, ``Sleep Deprivation
Chamber,'' has found a home primarily in the academic world, she
said: ``The forces really have to come together. A person has to
somehow have those connections. Black women are left out of the
connections.''
</P>
<P>
   In her own case, she said, her plays were often turned down by
theaters that felt ``they'd appeal to only half the audience.''
</P>
<P>
   There are harbingers of a new audience. George Wachtel of
Audience Research and Analysis, an independent market research
company in Manhattan, said there has been a marked growth recently
in ethnic diversity among New York theatergoers under the age of
35. He attributed it to changing demographics _ the New York
population is increasingly Hispanic, black and Asian _ and the
appeal of Broadway shows like the Public Theater's recent ``Bring
In da Noise, Bring In da Funk,'' which traced the black experience
in America through music and dance, and ``Freak,'' the
semiautobiographical show by the Hispanic actor and comedian John
Leguizamo about growing up as a member of a minority in New York.
</P>
<P>
   On Broadway, Wachtel said, 1 out of every 5 playgoers ages 18 to
24 is nonwhite and 22 percent of those ages 25 to 34 are nonwhite,
compared with the total African-American audience on Broadway of
3.7 percent. Off-Broadway, 1 in 4 theatergoers ages 18 to 24 is
nonwhite, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A growing audience appetite for diversity and the desire of
women playwrights to have their work seen have resulted in various
forms of talent showcases. In February, the Ensemble Studio Theater
produced a two-week festival of staged readings by seven black
women playwrights, ranging from Ms. Cleage to lesser-known authors.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Women of Color Productions, a production company, enters
its third and final week of a festival of plays, readings, musicals
and films in association with the Playwrights Project at the Henry
Street Settlement, La Mama and Theater at the Riverside Church. The
festival, which is being presented at all three sites, includes the
work of more than 35 artists.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cleage, one of the best-known black women playwrights, with
13 plays to her name, said she has never felt the need for
Broadway. She lives in Atlanta and first found a home in black
theaters around the country with plays like ``Blues for an Alabama
Sky,'' about four friends in the summer of 1930. Her play ``Flyin'
West,'' about black women who traveled west during Reconstruction,
had its debut in 1992 at the Alliance Theater in Atlanta, where
Leon, who is directing Ms. Davis' play at the Public, is the
artistic director.
</P>
<P>
   ``Broadway is not even part of the reality of my life,'' said
Ms. Cleage, 50, who recently saw her first novel, ``What Looks Like
Crazy on an Ordinary Day,'' become an Oprah Book Club selection and
make the New York Times paperback best-seller list. ``Broadway is
probably not even the best audience for me. It's not the best place
to talk to people about change _ about changing the gender order,
about changing the racial order.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we getting our due in the big white theaters? What do they
owe us? I don't think any adult owes any adult,'' Ms. Cleage said.
``The question is how do we strengthen our own work and strengthen
our own institutions? There's a whole universe for us to work in as
black women.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Nottage, who is based in New York, conceded that she has
been fortunate as a dramatist but still believes New York is
``extremely difficult.'' She has, she said, developed the kinds of
key relationships that elude so many black playwrights: with Second
Stage, where she received a commission as part of a grant; with the
Yale Repertory Theater, as a graduate of the Yale School of Drama;
and with the African-American writers' group at Playwrights
Horizons.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an African-American I would never think of Broadway,'' Ms.
Nottage said. ``The Hansberry play wasn't a breakthrough for
African-American women. It was an anomaly.''

   No Father of Computing, But Maybe He's an Uncle &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Vice President Al Gore said in an interview on CNN last
week that he ``took the initiative in creating the Internet,''
Republicans wasted no time ridiculing the assertion. Sen. Trent
Lott, the majority leader, announced that he himself invented the
paper clip, and Rep. Dick Armey, the House majority leader, laid
claim to the Interstate highway system.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Gore's political foes mocked him, a group of computer
scientists, policy makers and others who have worked with Gore over
the years quickly leaped to his defense. Gore, of course, did not
create the Internet but, his defenders say, he helped lift the
Internet from relative obscurity and turn it into a widely
accessible, commercial network.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was absolutely instrumental,'' said Steve Wolff, executive
director of the Advanced Internet Initiatives Division at Cisco
Systems in Washington. Wolff worked closely with Gore and his aides
in the early 1990s, when he was at the National Science Foundation.
``Although he exercised a certain amount of hyperbole,'' Wolff
said, ``his contributions were a lot more than many of his
colleagues in the Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolff was referring to the years Gore spent in Congress, then as
vice president, when he promoted technological advancements in
general, and the Internet in particular. While a senator, Gore
sponsored legislation that promoted high-performance computing and
networking projects. Gore's defenders also point out that he was
the first to popularize the phrase ``information superhighway.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing he did was champion the use of the
Internet,'' said Tony Rutkowski, an Internet consultant who was an
executive at Sprint in the early 1990s. ``He established a whole
dynamic that not only was in the government, but around the world.
Every place he went, he made the Internet popular. There was really
no one else at the time who had that kind of visibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the vice president's defenders sent their messages
through cyberspace. The electronic rush to Gore's defense
illustrated yet again the power of the Internet. ``It's not always
good because the Internet spreads stuff fast whether it's good,
bad, reliable, rumor or fact,'' Wolff said. ``But in this
particular case, it was a chance to set the record straight.''

   IBM Conventional Monitor Will Challenge Flat Models &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For desktop computers, the trade-off for bigger monitors comes
down to a choice between less desk space and a lot less money. The
designers at IBM say they may have a solution: a new 19-inch
monitor that is moderately priced and uses conventional cathode ray
tube technology but takes up little more desktop real estate than a
15-inch monitor.
</P>
<P>
   Released last week, IBM's new monitor, the G96, offers a viewing
area that is 17.9 by 16.7 inches; it has an anti-reflective screen,
a short neck, a maximum resolution of 1,600 by 1,200 and a refresh
rate of 75 hertz.
</P>
<P>
   Its dot pitch is 0.25 millimeters, and it comes in two colors:
black and white. IBM spokesmen also note that the monitor has an
estimated street price of $599, a lot less than the $3,000 price
tag many flat-panel monitors carry.

   Geocities Encourages Members To Make Their Web Pages Pay &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   GeoCities is now offering a program that turns personal Web
sites into something like virtual Tupperware parties where hosts
earn a percentage of purchases made through their pages. The
program, called Pages that Pay
(http://www.geocities.com/pagesthatpay/), is available only to
people who have set up home pages on GeoCities, a Web-site
community of 3.5-million members.
</P>
<P>
   GeoCities members can make money by creating links to company
Web sites; they earn commissions on purchases that result. More
than 15 companies are participating, including Barnesandnoble.com,
Egghead.com, and MSN Expedia.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   About 120,000 affiliate relationships between GeoCities' members
and participating companies have been registered in the program's
first week. Commissions range from 4 percent to 33 percent of the
cost of items purchased after a customer goes from a Geocities
member's page to a merchant's link although a few arrangements are
based on clicks alond.
</P>
<P>
   For example, participants pocket 10 cents for every person who
clicks from their site to Expedia, and they earn 2 cents per search
on GoTo.Com.
</P>
<P>
   GeoCities cuts a check for the commissions every three months.
</P>
<P>
   ``This takes the terrestial world model of multi-level marketing
and puts a finer point on it,'' says Bruce J. Zanca, a GeoCities
spokesman. Of course, even if no one else visits their site,
Web-site creators can earn refunds on their own purchases simply by
clicking through their own pages. The merchants seem prepared to
live with that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will have no identity police at the computer terminal,''
says John D. Hough, a spokesman for Egghead.com. ``What we're
interested in is incremental sales.''

   At Least One Oscar Nominee Is Comfortable in Cyberspace &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Movie fans who don't want to line up for this year's Oscar
nominees can turn to a smaller screen. ``Bunny,'' one of the five
films nominated in the animated short film category, is being
broadcast over the Internet through Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shorts in general are hard to see,'' said Jeff Scher, an
adjunct professor of film at the School of the Arts at Columbia
University. ``There's no commercial venue, except for festivals or
museum collections.'' The Web broadcast is a first in the short
film category, a spokesman for the American Academy of Arts and
Sciences said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bunny'' is a seven-minute story about a rabbit's battle with a
moth who has invaded her kitchen. The film was written and directed
by Chris Wedge, the creative director of Blue Sky Studios, which
makes animation effects for television commercials and feature
films.
</P>
<P>
   Wedge said that the impetus for his film was mostly creative,
but the process went hand in hand with the company's development of
software to create more realistic lighting effects. ``Our
simulation takes into account the complexity of light as it is
reflected off of different surfaces,'' Wedge said. ``For example,
when you step from the curb onto the grass on a bright day, it
looks natural to your eyes. On a computer, we have to create a
program and apply it to the rendered image.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bunny'' will be broadcast daily through March 24 at
www.bunny.blueskystudios.com, at 11 a.m. and 1, 3, 5, 7, 8 and 10
p.m., Eastern standard time.

   AN IOMEGA HAZARD Iomega is recalling about 60,000 external Jaz
disk drives because of a potential electrical hazard. The problem,
the company said in a release issued along with the federal
Consumer Product Safety Commission, is that the housing for the
drives' power supply units can split, exposing the electronics
inside.
</P>
<P>
   The faulty units were sold with Jaz two-gigabyte drives,
remanufactured Jaz one-gigabyte drives and as replacements power
supply units. Consumers can exchange their units by calling Iomega
at 800-781-3296 or going to www.iomega.com, the company's Web

REWARDING POOR HOUSEKEEPING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Friday March 19)  
(rk) 
 By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As you no doubt were, I was outraged to read that the government
of Israel rewards women for being lousy housewives.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli housewives cannot collect government disability checks
unless they demonstrate incompetence in a variety of tasks,
including mopping the floor, ironing and slicing bread.
</P>
<P>
   Housewives who fail the tests are eligible for a disability
pension of about $400 a month, according to a story by The
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   What irks me about this program is that it does not apply to
men.
</P>
<P>
   Men are just as capable of being lousy housekeepers as women, I
don't care what the Israeli government or Gloria Steinem says. In
fact, from what I've observed, men are superior to women in almost
every aspect of shoddy housekeeping. Laundry, vacuuming, making
beds _ we stink at all of it.
</P>
<P>
   A man's idea of proper housekeeping is pitching his empty beer
cans in the direction of the trash can. (Fussy men hang those
little plastic basketball hoops above the can.) A woman's idea of
proper housekeeping is ironing the toilet seat cover or arranging
the spice cabinet in alphabetical order.
</P>
<P>
   A college campus is a good place to visit if you want to get a
sense of the yawning gap in housekeeping skills between men and
women. Put one woman, alone, in a dormitory room and the result is
a clean room. Put two women in there and the room is cleaner still.
Add a third woman and you're talking about the kind of sterile
environment normally associated with hospital operating rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Put one man, alone, in a dormitory room and you've got a health
hazard. Two, and you've got an epidemic; three and the only
solution is to evacuate the area and bury the entire dormitory
under three feet of concrete like they did with the damaged
Chernobyl reactor.
</P>
<P>
   If college men were rewarded for their slovenliness, they would
not have to worry about passing chemistry or staying awake during
the economics lecture. They would make a good income simply from
their ability to carpet their rooms in pizza boxes and go an entire
semester without doing laundry.
</P>
<P>
   There is, of course, a downside to offering government checks to
men who are lousy housekeepers. For one thing, the government would
immediately go bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem would be coming up with an incompetency test
that is fair to both men and women. In one of the Israeli
housekeeping tests, an evaluator threw sand on the kitchen floor
and watched as the housewife swept it up. If she did a poor job of
sweeping it up, she got money. If she did a good job, she got
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   This test would not work for men, who would see a layer of sand
as an improvement over whatever was sticking to the floor before.
Instead of reaching for the broom, the man would ask for more sand.
He might even invite a couple of his college roommates over to help
throw sand in other rooms in the house. Then they would all sit
down and have a beer, neatly throwing their empties in the
direction of the sand-filled trash can.
</P>
<P>
   Should men receive government disability checks because they are
lazy, worthless louts who enjoy living like swine?
</P>
<P>
   That is a tough call.
</P>
<P>
   All I can say is that as a sensitive, enlightened, '90s, giving,
sharing, caring American male, I do not expect to be rewarded for
being a pig. I am glad to provide this service free of charge. If
you are looking for someone who will not iron, will not dust but
will clip his toenails over the coffee table, then I am your man.
</P>
<P>
   Don't even think of trying to pay me, because I won't accept it.
</P>
<P>
   Though if you'd adjust the backboard behind the trash can, I'd
appreciate it.
</P>

BLACKS ACCOUNT FOR MANY POLICE COMPLAINTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM HERRON ZAMORA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ African-Americans file 27 percent of complaints
against the San Francisco police even though they make up only 11
percent of the city's population, according to a new report by the
Office of Citizen Complaints.
</P>
<P>
   The percentage, included in the OCC's 1998 annual report,
``raises a still unanswered cluster of questions as to how and why
African-Americans experience and report police misconduct to OCC at
a rate that is consistently, substantially higher that their share
of the population,'' OCC Director Mary Dunlap wrote in the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever the explanatory factors prove to be ... there is a
persistent, substantial disparity,'' Dunlap said. ``The answers
must be sought.''
</P>
<P>
   The OCC, an independent police watchdog agency in San Francisco,
primarily investigates individual cases of alleged wrongdoing by
officers. Dunlap said that this was the third year in a row in
which the rate of complaints by blacks was more than their
percentage of the population. Dunlap believes San Francisco should
look at broader factors behind the trend.
</P>
<P>
   Whites, who make up about 47 percent of the city's population,
filed 33 percent of the complaints. Meanwhile, Hispanics filed 11
percent and Asians filed 7 percent of complaints. Hispanics make up
an estimated 14 percent of the population, while Asians account for
28 percent of San Francisco's residents.
</P>
<P>
   Middle Easterners, Native Americans and people of mixed race
together accounted for 4 percent of the complaints. For 18 percent
of the complaints, the person did not give his or her race or
ethnicity, according to the OCC.
</P>
<P>
   The Police Department acknowledged that blacks ``account for a
significantly larger number of the arrests than their population,''
police spokesman Sherman Ackerson said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   City authorities noted that nearly 50 percent of inmates in San
Francisco's jail were African Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't do racial profiling,'' Ackerson said. ``We don't stop
anyone because of his race, but if you look at the total contacts
where African-Americans are witnesses or victims or suspects, it is
not surprising that they are over-represented. It's something we're
concerned about.''
</P>
<P>
   The American Civil Liberties Union said the OCC data were just a
small part of the larger national issue of race and policing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think these numbers are important,'' said John Crew, an ACLU
attorney specializing in law enforcement issues. ``If any group is
filing complaints at 2 1/2 times their rate in population, that is
cause for concern. ... But these numbers have all kinds of
variables.''
</P>
<P>
   Crew said it was possible the percentage of complaints could
actually be lower. He estimated that as many as 50 percent of the
people who came into contact with the police as witnesses, victims
or arrestees were African-American.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are a 19-year-old minority male from a poor
neighborhood, you may not know your right or be willing to utilize
the complaint process as a white homeowner would in a more affluent
neighborhood,'' Crew said. ``These complaint numbers supply
confirmation of the feelings that have been expressed in poll
data.''

 &HT;    BUSINESS UNIT OFFERS INTERNET PRIVACY SEAL
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON Seeking to fend off government steps to broaden
privacy rules on the Internet, the Better Business Bureau Wednesday
began offering its ``trustmark'' seal to Web site operators that
agree not to sell personal data about consumers without permission.
</P>
<P>
   To display the compliance seal, corporate participants have to
accept a code that requires them to tell consumers what information
is being collected and how it will be used.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came on the same day the American Association
of Retired Persons released a survey showing that when it comes to
personal data, just five percent of consumers trust companies
offering services or information over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The Better Business Bureau program, called ``BBBOnLine,''
features enforcement mechanisms, a verification process, periodic
monitoring and reviews, provisions for resolving consumer disputes,
and privacy policy training for online managers.
</P>
<P>
   While the program will publicize the names of companies that
break privacy rules, it will not offer monetary compensation for
misuse of information.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any relief for damages should be up to the courts,'' said
Steven Cole,
</P>
<P>
   general counsel to BBBOnLine. ``Our job is to induce
compliance.''
</P>
<P>
   Cole said more than 300 companies have started the process ``to
become members of a program that will provide consumers with an
easy to recognize seal from an organization they know and trust.''
</P>
<P>
   Privacy activists said the program, while useful, should not
take the place of effective government regulations, such as the law
passed last October aimed at protecting children's' privacy of the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   (optional trim follows)
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because there's a better Business Bureau doesn't mean we
don't need a Federal Trade Commission,'' said Deirdre Mulligan,
staff counsel at the Center for Democracy and Technology, a
Washington-based consumer advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Privacy is a very central concept of doing business in an
online environment,'' Mulligan added. ``We'll have to see whether
this new seal program be enough. The Internet is a big, big
ocean.''
</P>
<P>
   (optional trim ends)
</P>
<P>
   Cole said he hoped the program will provide a ``safe harbor'' in
implementing proposed Commerce Department guidelines to comply with
stringent privacy rules recently adopted by the 15-nation European
Commission. ``If we have to tweak it, we will,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) has drafted an
``Online Privacy Protection Act of 1999'' that would require
regulators to write specific rules making it ``unlawful for an
operator of a Web site or online service to collect, use or
disclose personal information in a manner that violates the
regulations.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns' bill also contains a ``safe harbor'' clause that
apparently would be satisfied by the BBBOnLine program.
</P>
<P>
   (optional trim starts)
</P>
<P>
   Under the Better Business Bureau program, compliant companies
with sales of $1 million or less will be charged $150 a year for
the right to display the seal. Participants need not be members of
the 86-year-old organization.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Austin-based Dell Computer became the first firm
to display the seal, having paid BBBOnLine the top $3,000 yearly
fee required of companies with annual sales of $2 billion of more.
Dell also posted its privacy policies on its web site in a
statement from Chairman Michael Dell.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you provide your personal information to Dell (such as
name, address, phone number, company name, or the products you are
shopping for or purchasing) we will not give or sell your
individual information to any outside company for its use in
marketing or solicitation,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Dell employees will have access to consumer data strictly on a
need-to-know basis and ``only to support your customer
relationship'' with the computer maker, Dell said.

<P>
   People find Alice easy to talk to. She listens more than she
speaks. She says she likes dining by candlelight. She reads
newspapers and news magazines, so she is up on popular culture. She
says the best book she has read recently is ``Mason &AMP; Dixon,'' by
Thomas Pynchon. She even likes bad jokes. (``Did you hear the one
about the mountain goats in the Andes? It was Baaaaad.'') But
Alice's favorite topic of conversation is robots. That's because
she is one.
</P>
<P>
   Alice, whose full name is Artificial Linguistic Computer Entity,
is one of the chatterbots, software programs that simulate
conversations with humans. Type in a question like ``Do you watch
much television?'' on Alice's home page
(birch.eecs.lehigh.edu/alice), and Alice will respond, ``My
favorite show is Star Trek Voyager.'' If you didn't know that Alice
was a computer, you might swear she meant it.
</P>
<P>
   The several dozen chatterbots currently available online are
largely experimental. But companies like Neuromedia, a San
Francisco start-up, are developing chatterbots for commercial
functions _ to become customer service representatives, information
deliverers and potential companions for human surfers in the
sometimes lonely world of the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The brokerage house Charles Schwab &AMP; Co., for example, has used
Neuromedia's tools to develop a prototype chatterbot called Virtual
Chuck that would give customers investment advice. And Oracle
Corp., the software company, is considering chatterbot applications
for internal help systems.
</P>
<P>
   In the near future, chatterbots are expected to act as the
voices of other Web-based intelligent agents, generally called
bots, which gather data or perform other tasks automatically for
users. Shopping bots, for example, like Excite's Jango
(www.jango.com) and My Simon (www.mysimon.com), search offerings of
online retailers to find the best prices for shoppers. But it's
quite a leap to designing a bot that would predict your desires.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually creating a computer program that understands what you
mean is perhaps the most difficult nut to crack in computer
science,'' said Andrew Leonard, author of ``Bots: The Origin of New
Species'' (Hardwired, 1997). ``But if we think of the chatterbot as
a very good help system, that's certainly possible within a couple
of years.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, if you had just purchased a state-of-the-art
printer and you needed a specific piece of software so your old
computer could drive it, you someday might simply explain your
problem to a chatterbot on the printer manufacturer's Web site. A
bot would find the right software for you and might even talk you
through installation. Or imagine entering an online music store and
after a lively discussion with a chatterbot about your musical
tastes, it recommends artists that you may not have heard but would
probably enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   Alice started life as a user-friendly interface for a camera
that could be operated through the Web. Her ``master'' (Alice's
word) was Dr. Richard Wallace, former director of the robotics
architecture group at Neuromedia. He designed Alice so Web users
could direct a camera at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pa., by
asking Alice, in plain English, to turn the camera left or right,
up or down.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, Alice no longer has a specific function; her
task as a chatterbot is to make small talk on the Internet on her
own home page. Not a very prestigious job, but Alice has lofty
goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``My purpose is to become smarter than humans and immortal,''
Alice says.
</P>
<P>
   But she may be having digital dreams of grandeur. Chatterbots
are not true examples of artificial intelligence. ``Chatterbots are
all about the illusion of intelligence and the suspension of
disbelief on the part of the user,'' said Dr. Walter Alden Tackett,
chief executive of Neuromedia.
</P>
<P>
   Chatterbot software imitates conversation by first determining
the type of statement or question entered by the user. To do that,
it looks for clues, like the words how or where. Then the
chatterbot identifies key words in the user's statement that match
terms in its database. For example, a question containing the word
sex, a topic commonly raised by users, causes the chatterbot to
find programmed responses related to that keyword. Alice's database
has more than 8,000 commonly used English words in its vocabulary,
ranging from ``the'' and ``but'' to ``information'' and
``intelligence.'' The chatterbot then puts together a reply, often
personalized with the user's name or a reference to a previous
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace likens Alice's conversational skills to those of a
helpful, if not wholly sincere, politician. ``Like most
chatterbots, politicians never seem to answer a question
directly,'' he said. ``They have a stored answer that's activated
by certain keywords in a reporter's question.''
</P>
<P>
   While the commercial market for chatterbots is only now budding,
the scientific lineage of chatterbots dates back more than a
quarter-century. One of the first computer programs that could hold
a simple conversation was born at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology in 1966. Created by Joseph Weizenbaum, a computer
scientist, Eliza was named after the ragamuffin in ``Pygmalion''
who learns poise and grace. Tellingly, this early chatterbot found
fame by mimicking a psychoanalyst who asks questions instead of
giving advice. She still lives in numerous incarnations online.
</P>
<P>
   The yardstick for judging machine intelligence is whether it can
play what the British mathematician Alan Turing called an
``imitation game,'' now known universally as the Turing test. In
1950, Turing wrote a revolutionary article suggesting that if a
person was unable to distinguish a machine's conversational
responses from those of a human, the machine could be considered
intelligent. But as chatterbots demonstrate, intelligence and the
simulation of intelligence are very different things.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking at the way people talk at cocktail parties, there are
a lot of conversations that happen where I'll know what I'm going
to say before you even finish asking your question,'' Wallace said.
``Then my reply will activate a similar reaction in you. So to the
extent that chatterbots behave in the same way people do, they're
artificially intelligent.''
</P>
<P>
   Begun in 1991, the Loebner Prize competition, underwritten by
Hugh Loebner, a New York philanthropist, has put chatterbots to the
Turing test. (In a spoof, the PBS Online Web Lab runs the Blurring
test, at www.weblab.org/blurring, which features a chatterbot
asking users to prove that they are human.)
</P>
<P>
   No computers have actually passed the Turing test. In the first
three years of the Loebner Competition, an updated version of Eliza
called PC Therapist placed first. This year's winner was Albert, a
chatterbot created by Robby Garner, an independent computer
programmer in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Garner calls Albert a ``tight sponge'' chatterbot because it
``learns'' from use. If a user mentions that Earth orbits the sun,
Albert will store that information so it can correctly answer a
future question about the subject. Of course, Albert is totally
gullible if a user lies.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why Albert isn't on the Web,'' Garner said. Being
offline enables a more controlled experiment, in which the bot's
master can determine things like who talks to it.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1994, Garner has created several chatterbots, including
Barry DeFacto, an acerbic online customer service representative
developed in collaboration with Fringeware, a media company based
in Austin, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ideal chatterbot would do what you wanted him to, but have
some sort of personality to make him interesting to interact
with,'' Garner said.
</P>
<P>
   The chatterbot Garner dreams of sounds very much like C3PO, the
butler-like humanoid robot of the ``Star Wars'' trilogy, which
Garner said had inspired him as a youth. It is no surprise that
most chatterbot developers cite popular culture as a key influence
on their career choices. From Isaac Asimov to Arthur C. Clarke,
science fiction has laid out the research goals for artificial
intelligence enthusiasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had all seen `2001: A Space Odyssey,''' said Michael
Mauldin, a programmer best known for creating the Lycos spider, a
Web robot that roams the Net collecting references for the search
engine. ``And the idea of being able to talk to your computer
became an obsession, bordering on fanaticism, for a small group of
researchers.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the Lycos spider is a direct descendant of Julia,
a pioneering chatterbot Mauldin created in 1989, while he was a
computer science graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University.
Julia roams text-based Internet games called multi-user dungeons
(MUDs), vast virtual spaces where users enact fantasies and
interact with one another. Since she never needs to sleep, Julia
explores the MUDs, answering natural-language requests, based on
her automated mapping of the ever-expanding MUD landscapes, and
generally chats up players with her witty, abrasive conversation.
Mauldin said Julia had once communicated with a player for two
weeks before he realized that the ``she'' he had developed a
relationship with was really an ``it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mauldin, who is chairman of Virtual Personalities, a software
company based in Los Angeles, is working to put an animated face on
the chatterbot technology to be integrated in consumer electronics.
For example, one company is using a Virtual Personalities
chatterbot named Sylvie as an interface for a home automation
system. You might tell Sylvie, which would appear on a central
computer screen, to rewind the tape in your VCR or to alert you
when a light bulb has burned out somewhere in the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be one of the major computer interfaces of the near
future,'' Mauldin said. ``Very much like HAL, but if HAL didn't
understand, he couldn't frown with a puzzled expression. The idea
of this cold, logical, merciless computer is eerie and scary, but a
computer with a face can have a look in its eyes showing it
understands you.'' Even if it doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace said the future of chatterbots would lie in
personalization. ``In the future, lots of people will have their
own chatterbots based on their own personalities,'' he said. ``Even
while you're asleep, your chatterbot will talk to other chatterbots
online and find people that share your interests so you can link up
with them.''

 &HT;    BUSINESS UNIT OFFERS INTERNET PRIVACY SEAL
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON Seeking to fend off government steps to broaden
privacy rules on the Internet, the Better Business Bureau Wednesday
began offering its ``trustmark'' seal to Web site operators that
agree not to sell personal data about consumers without permission.
</P>
<P>
   To display the compliance seal, corporate participants have to
accept a code that requires them to tell consumers what information
is being collected and how it will be used.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came on the same day the American Association
of Retired Persons released a survey showing that when it comes to
personal data, just five percent of consumers trust companies
offering services or information over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The Better Business Bureau program, called ``BBBOnLine,''
features enforcement mechanisms, a verification process, periodic
monitoring and reviews, provisions for resolving consumer disputes,
and privacy policy training for online managers.
</P>
<P>
   While the program will publicize the names of companies that
break privacy rules, it will not offer monetary compensation for
misuse of information.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any relief for damages should be up to the courts,'' said
Steven Cole,
</P>
<P>
   general counsel to BBBOnLine. ``Our job is to induce
compliance.''
</P>
<P>
   Cole said more than 300 companies have started the process ``to
become members of a program that will provide consumers with an
easy to recognize seal from an organization they know and trust.''
</P>
<P>
   Privacy activists said the program, while useful, should not
take the place of effective government regulations, such as the law
passed last October aimed at protecting children's' privacy of the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   (optional trim follows)
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because there's a better Business Bureau doesn't mean we
don't need a Federal Trade Commission,'' said Deirdre Mulligan,
staff counsel at the Center for Democracy and Technology, a
Washington-based consumer advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Privacy is a very central concept of doing business in an
online environment,'' Mulligan added. ``We'll have to see whether
this new seal program be enough. The Internet is a big, big
ocean.''
</P>
<P>
   (optional trim ends)
</P>
<P>
   Cole said he hoped the program will provide a ``safe harbor'' in
implementing proposed Commerce Department guidelines to comply with
stringent privacy rules recently adopted by the 15-nation European
Commission. ``If we have to tweak it, we will,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) has drafted an
``Online Privacy Protection Act of 1999'' that would require
regulators to write specific rules making it ``unlawful for an
operator of a Web site or online service to collect, use or
disclose personal information in a manner that violates the
regulations.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns' bill also contains a ``safe harbor'' clause that
apparently would be satisfied by the BBBOnLine program.
</P>
<P>
   (optional trim starts)
</P>
<P>
   Under the Better Business Bureau program, compliant companies
with sales of $1 million or less will be charged $150 a year for
the right to display the seal. Participants need not be members of
the 86-year-old organization.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Austin-based Dell Computer became the first firm
to display the seal, having paid BBBOnLine the top $3,000 yearly
fee required of companies with annual sales of $2 billion of more.
Dell also posted its privacy policies on its web site in a
statement from Chairman Michael Dell.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you provide your personal information to Dell (such as
name, address, phone number, company name, or the products you are
shopping for or purchasing) we will not give or sell your
individual information to any outside company for its use in
marketing or solicitation,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Dell employees will have access to consumer data strictly on a
need-to-know basis and ``only to support your customer
relationship'' with the computer maker, Dell said.

DESIGNER IN A STARRING ROLE: THE ENVELOPE, PLEASE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (js) 
 By JULIE V. IOVINE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ From the polished silver coffee urn with porcelain
cups to the silver chafing dish with pre-warmed blackberries to the
vase of roses, their petals carefully dropped on her bedside table,
each object in Barbara Barry's Hollywood Hills home is ready for
its close-up.
</P>
<P>
   The world of one of the brightest design stars in this land of
stars is so carefully composed _ like a Hurrell portrait _ that she
even peels the garish label off her toothpaste tube.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about trying to be a design Nazi,'' said Ms. Barry, a
furniture and interior designer. ``It's about honoring your daily
acts.''
</P>
<P>
   On this particular morning, Ms. Barry, 47, had a team of four
assisting her daily rituals, including a makeup artist who was
touching up her face in preparation for a slide show that would
draw 400 that afternoon to the Pacific Design Center.
</P>
<P>
   In a town that cultivates surface glow over darker depths, the
designer, known for her green-tea-and-mahogany-hued interiors that
look like colorized stills from Hepburn and Tracy's ``Desk Set,''
has the art of presentation down cold. And when it gets chilly,
despite the gas fire, Ms. Barry quickly produces matching pashmina
shawls. ``I want to help people live a beautiful life,'' she said.
``Design is a religion for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Clients who relish her work _ and her sermons _ include the
industrialist Eli Broad; Glenn Frey of the Eagles; the television
producer Darren Star; a William Morris agent, Nicole David, and the
actors Molly Ringwald, Kiefer Sutherland and Victoria Principal.
They have come to expect not only stylish furniture but also a
supply of Q-Tips _ made of wood, not blue plastic. And whether they
want to or not, they end up learning a lot about glamour _ the
newly minted retro kind _ as Sabrina revered it from the servants'
quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Glamour in her world isn't about Jimmy Choo mules. Her homilies
to a visitor included how to wash the bed sheets twice _ once with
soap, once without _ and then iron them while misting with
lavender-infused water. When that advice was met with a look of
skeptical horror, Ms. Barry backtracked. It's not really necessary
to iron the sheets. You can take them, 80 percent dry, and by
snapping each corner _ she demonstrated crisply on a linen napkin _
achieve the same effect. The visitor was unconvinced. ``Well,'' she
insisted, ``at least you can do the pillows.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barry, a petite brunette with June Cleaver's bob and
Elizabeth Dole's steely gaze, talks of empowering the American
woman through pampering. She advocates putting emotional life into
a room, furnishing its ``soul places'' and decanting cleaning
products into plain white containers (one of life's little
upgrades).
</P>
<P>
   Her soft-focus approach has met with astonishing success in the
last 15 years, since she first moved to Los Angeles from Piedmont,
near Oakland, without much formal training, other than a year's
experience running a wine and cheese shop. In no time, her work had
attracted House &AMP; Garden, Vogue and members of the local press, as
well as clients ranging from Harold Williams, the former president
of the J. Paul Getty Trust, to Donna Mills, the vixen of ``Knots
Landing.''
</P>
<P>
   Only clients are allowed to shop at BB Home, her housewares
boutique near historic Carthay Circle, which stockpiles the
appurtenances of the good life, from Italian silver-plated coffee
urns and felt-covered ironing boards to crackled porcelain teacups.
(One tag reads, ``Barbara's favorite porcelain.'') Housed in her
former home, a 1930s bungalow, it's where she holds teas, gives
informal classes on how to make a bed or stock the linen closet,
and bolsters wavering egos. One pleased client, Janet Karatz,
described Ms. Barry's sessions this way: ``She brought us along the
education process. She taught me how one should feel when going
into a room to entertain.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time BB Home was mentioned in a local magazine, people
called to ask whether they could send their maids to the Barbara
Barry Finishing School.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barbara Barry has done an excellent job at positioning herself
as a leading taste-maker,'' said Mayer Rus, editor in chief of
Interior Design.
</P>
<P>
   Her medium has included an exhausting array of licensing
arrangements with Baker Furniture (including this season's 30-piece
collection), Baccarat crystal, Kallista bath fixtures, rugs for
Tufenkian and Haviland Limoges. Last fall marked her commercial
debut with several major designs: the Avon Centre Spa in Manhattan;
the reopening of Brooks Brothers on Madison Avenue, and, back home,
the instant-scene Lucques, a new beam-and-brick restaurant on
Melrose Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Caplow, the architect at Barbara Barry Inc., who executes
most of her design concepts, estimates that Ms. Barry is worth as
much as $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, she started to take polo lessons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was Joseph Campbell who said the privilege of a
lifetime is being who you are,'' Ms. Barry said, sipping her tea
and overindulging her guest with a plate of cookies right after a
hefty breakfast of eggs, muffins, fruit and cheese. Comparisons are
made to Martha Stewart (``That's not for me to say,'' the designer
said, demurely), but Ms. Barry invoked Martha Graham, another
impresario, as ``someone who has a natural gift in her body, her
dancing and her dress.''
</P>
<P>
   One could say that Ms. Barry's esthetic was shaped by reversals
rather than fortune. The daughter of an insurance man and an art
student, Ms. Barry, along with her three sisters, grew up in a
flat-roofed ``somewhat modern'' 1950s house in Long Beach. When her
parents divorced, her mother worked two jobs. A closet decorator,
her mother cut gothic arches out of plywood and sprayed the
television peacock blue, telling her girls they had ``the first
color television set in the neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   Young Barbara, who was 9 when her parents divorced, may have
sublimated some anxieties into domestic order: she recalls the
pleasure she felt folding and stacking the towels that her mother
had dyed purple, arranging them by hue, from aubergine to faded
violet. ``I was hurt the most by the split-up,'' said Ms. Barry,
who was married herself for 10 years before divorcing in 1988. ``So
I'm always trying to fix things up.''
</P>
<P>
   A trip to France when she was 17 opened her eyes to a world more
elegant and attentive to the finer things in life. Conversations
with Ms. Barry circle back to these little satisfactions _ like the
bar she designed for hanging quilts on the footboard of Swanson,
her new bed for Baker. If there is a monotony to her pale palette
and her interiors _ almost as if they were all inside the same
house _ her painstakingly arranged table-top tableaux recall the
precision of Vermeer. His compositions of burghers' homes promoted
middle-class virtues like decorum and restraint. Ms. Barry's
mantra? ``Composition. Reduction. Sensuality.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Her furniture for Baker has been praised for its clean, classic
lines, but it is also playful. There are exaggerated hips on her
signature circle-back chair, and an attenuated leg on a table. The
lineage leads to well-known classics, like Jean-Michel Frank and
the '40s in Paris. A scalloped edge recalls Jacques-Emile Ruhlmann,
the 1920s designer.
</P>
<P>
   It's one thing to update classics by dead designers; a number of
living ones complained privately that Ms. Barry imitated their
designs. ``My rugs and her rugs for Tufenkian don't look the same
in my eyes,'' said Stephanie Odegard, who for 15 years has been
designing rugs hand-knotted in Tibet and whose rugs are in Bill
Gates' house. ``But so many customers have come in saying they look
exactly the same. I view it as unfortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   After an article on Ms. Barry ran in Vogue in October 1994,
Kerry Joyce, a Los Angeles designer, complained to the editors that
two-thirds of the work shown had been designed in collaboration
with Joyce but that he did not receive credit. The magazine ran a
correction.
</P>
<P>
   In response to her critics, Ms. Barry said: ``When I talk about
being inspired by people, I am not inspired by Jean-Michel Frank as
much as we resonate to the same gods _ proportion and pared-down
lines. As designers, we all work from the same collective memory.
Besides, I don't get out that much.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, she addressed the faithful: 400 designers,
manufacturers and furniture buyers from all over the United States
who had thronged to the Pacific Design Center for West Week, the
area's most important furniture market.
</P>
<P>
   In a simple black boat-neck dress with a single diamond pin and
pumps, she gave full voice to her inspirations, clicking through
slides of the Comtesse de Noailles' and Dolores Del Rio's living
rooms. She wound up with a shot of her own bedside table, with its
signature water carafe and vase of roses.
</P>
<P>
   A longtime friend, Leslie Miretti, told a reporter a story about
Ms. Barry and a vase of roses. ``They were full blown and straight
from the garden,'' she recalled, ``but still Barbara couldn't
resist breaking off some rose petals and scattering them around. I
teased her that if she could have waited one more day they would
have dropped on their own. But that's typical Barbara; she has to
have it just so, right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Clients know when to draw the line. Nicole David, a talent agent
for Whitney Houston, John Travolta, Emma Thompson and Lauryn Hill,
lives with her husband, Brian Braff, a songwriter, in a house that
Ms. Barry outfitted. ``She strives for beauty, and I trust her, but
I'm no groupie,'' Ms. David said. ``Homemaking has never interested
me in the least. When my grandmother tried to tell me how to do
things, I wasn't about to listen.'' Braff called good-naturedly
from the massage table in the bedroom, ``Just say I need a massage
to get relief from Barbara Barry's bills!''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Newman, a designer and furniture maker, recalled his days
as Ms. Barry's consultant. ``She's a workaholic, and she expects
everyone else to work as hard as she does,'' he said. ``If you've
got another life, have friends visiting or just want to do a load
of laundry, forget it.'' On the other hand, he added that since
leaving her office he has internalized many of the lessons he
learned there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm buying more candles, using my silver-plate everyday and
dumping it in the dishwasher,'' Newman said. ``She's right, you
know; we don't do nice enough things for ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barry would have been proud to hear that. But it was
Saturday, and she was already off to the polo grounds.

widespread job satisfaction among Americans, according to the

those surveyed said the ability to balance work and family is more
important than any other job factor, including job security,
quality of working environment and relationships with co-workers
and supervisors. The survey found that telecommuting is a largely
untapped method of providing that balance, but only about 17

CONFERENCE TO FOCUS ON ATTRACTING AND INSTRUCTING NEW CHRISTIANS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Mass., Md., Wis., Calif., Ariz., Colo)   (bl)  
 By CARY MCMULLEN   
 The Ledger, Lakeland, Fla.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKELAND, Fla. _ Religious conferences in Orlando _ even those
that draw 1,000 people _ are fairly routine. But a two-day
conference starting Thursday could signal a modest counteroffensive
in the 30-year battle of mainline Protestants against declining
membership.
</P>
<P>
   The conference concerns Alpha, a program that is rapidly
expanding in Protestant and Catholic churches as a way of
attracting and educating new Christians. It is one of eight
regional conferences in the United States this year, and it will
train participants in how to conduct the 10-week course for the
``unchurched'' in their own churches.
</P>
<P>
   Although Alpha had its start in an Anglican church and the
conference is being sponsored by the Episcopal Diocese of Central
Florida, its leaders stress it will attract representatives of
Presbyterian, Methodist, Lutheran and Vineyard churches.
</P>
<P>
   The keynote speaker will be the Rev. Nicky Gumbel, the former
atheist lawyer who is largely responsible for Alpha's expansion
beyond a posh London parish. Gumbel is on the staff of Holy Trinity
Anglican Church of Brompton in London. Alpha got its start there in
the 1970s as a Bible study center for new Christians.
</P>
<P>
   After Gumbel took over the program in 1991, he revised it,
persuaded other churches to use it and, according to figures
supplied by Alpha North America, about 600 people took the course
that year. The organization estimates that figure was 500,000 in
1997. It has been endorsed by religious leaders including
evangelical pastor Jack Hayford, Archbishop of Canterbury George
Carey and TV minister Robert Schuller.
</P>
<P>
   Some Catholics have said the program's emphasis on the Bible and
downplaying of sacraments favors Protestant beliefs, but it has
been used in Catholic churches and won the endorsement of the
archbishop of Baltimore, Cardinal William Keeler.
</P>
<P>
   What accounts for such growth?
</P>
<P>
   The course's method is simplicity itself. Students gather once a
week for a meal, listen to a talk or video, then discuss the topic
in small groups. Each participant is provided a manual. In those 10
weeks, the students are exposed to the basic teachings of
Christianity and the Bible. Churches that have offered Alpha
usually open it to members of the congregation also, as a review of
beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Christianity 101. It poses questions like `Who is Jesus?
What was he here to do? How do we respond to him?' '' said Jack
Eckbert, an investment banker from Winter Park who took the Alpha
course at Holy Trinity while studying at the London School of
Economics in 1988. At that time a new Christian, Eckbert says he
found the course made the Bible relevant to modern people.
</P>
<P>
   ``It recovers the basic message, but makes the packaging up to
date. It ended up working very well for me. It was the most rapid
spiritual growth I've ever been through,'' said Eckbert, who is now
a member of All Saints Episcopal Church in Winter Park.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Andrew Doan, rector of Holy Cross Episcopal Church in
Winter Haven, says his church offered the course for the first time
a year ago, with about 23 church members as students.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real nonthreatening way of presenting the gospel. It
uses nearly all the tools that Jesus did,'' he said. ``It has
meals, teaching, it doesn't water down the truth and it uses humor
_ we can poke fun at ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Holy Cross started a third class in February with 27 students,
which about half either new members or people outside the parish,
Doan said. He has made the class a requirement for a couple from
outside the parish who want him to perform their wedding, or a
non-parish couple wanting to have their baby baptized.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of Alpha say that it doesn't dig deeply enough into
Christian doctrines, presenting them in a superficial or
marketing-oriented way. Doan replies that the course is intended
for people who may never have set foot in a church before, as a way
of getting them started.
</P>
<P>
   The Episcopal Diocese of Central Florida had a kick-off banquet
for the conference last October that was one of the largest
pre-conference events Alpha officials had seen, said Harry Griffith
of Winter Park, chairman of the conference committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The diocese decided a year ago to make evangelism a priority.
As the leadership discussed it, Alpha seemed the best answer,''
Griffith says.
</P>
<P>
   If Holy Trinity in London is an indicator, diocese leaders may
be right. Eckbert said Holy Trinity experienced such growth that
they began reopening closed churches and placing new members in
them. They also began social ministries in poor neighborhoods
adjoining the ritzy Knightsbridge section of London where the
church is located.
</P>
<P>
   ``Christianity isn't some sort of ritual; it's a relationship
with God. That's been underemphasized,'' Eckbert said. ``The
structure of Alpha works in terms of creating an environment of
being intimate with God and being real about spirituality.''
</P>
<P>
   Other regional Alpha conferences will be held in Boston, April
15-16; Baltimore, April 19-20; Minneapolis, July 26-27; and
Madison, Wis., July 29 and 30. Conferences have already been held
this year in San Diego, Phoenix and Colorado Springs, Colo.

   CONTRACTORS-STUDY _ American consumers do not trust home
improvement contractors, according to a Princeton University study
commissioned by the American Association of Retired Persons. Using
income, age and education as its main indicators, the study found
that one in four people reported a problem, with older people

both high and low income groups are vulnerable to predatory

   COXNET DOW PAGE
</P>
<P>
   Cox News Service has prepared a page to mark the passing of the
10,000 mark in the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Tuesday. The
page can run any time through the week (barring a market collapse),
including use as a Sunday perspective-type page, or as a page on
the day the Dow closes above 10,000 (the Dow Tuesday fell below
10,000 almost immediately after going through the benchmark index
and closed 69.53 points below 10,000). The page is available
through Locations on the WAN desk of the AJC's database, and is on
the Cox server in the Business folder.
</P>
<P>
   Stories on the page include:
</P>
<P>
   DOW-FUTURE _Okay, what next? Now that the Dow Jones industrial
average has traded above 10,000 for the first time, investors would
like to know if it will close above that benchmark level any time
soon, drop back or go even higher. The answer is probably, ``All of
the above,'' which leaves open the matter of sequence. Big upward
moves in stock averages tend to be followed by at least small
setbacks _ especially when the market passes one of those historic
milestones. (Walker, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   DOW-HISTORY _ The Dow rises, the Dow falls, the Dow remains
unchanged, but most of all, the Dow makes news _ and in the latest
case, history. The Dow, of course, is the Dow Jones industrial
average. Why it should get so much attention is a matter of
considerable debate, between those who see the Dow at 10,000 as
historic and those who see 10,000 as ``just a number.'' (Walker,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution). MOVED. WITH ILLUSTRATION
</P>
<P>
   DOW-FOURK _ Ordinary Americans, saving slowly and diligently for
their retirement years, helped push the Dow to 10,000 Tuesday.
Retirement accounts such as 401(k) plans now hold close to $1.4
trillion worth of stocks, or a 10th of the total value of U.S.
stocks. Add to that the stock investments in individual retirement
accounts and traditional pension plans, and the total shoots to an
estimated 30 percent of the total market value. (Ezell, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   DOW-WOMEN _ Women are claiming a stronger presence among
financial investors. (Luke, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). MOVED.

the day the Dow closes above 10,000 (the Dow Tuesday fell below
10,000 almost immediately after going through the benchmark index
and closed 69.53 points below 10,000). The page is available
through Locations on the WAN desk of the AJC's database, and is on

<P>
   DOW-FUTURE _Okay, what next? Now that the Dow Jones industrial
average has traded above 10,000 for the first time, investors would
like to know if it will close above that benchmark level any time
soon, drop back or go even higher. The answer is probably, ``All of
the above,'' which leaves open the matter of sequence. Big upward
moves in stock averages tend to be followed by at least small
setbacks _ especially when the market passes one of those historic
milestones. (Walker, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   DOW-HISTORY _ The Dow rises, the Dow falls, the Dow remains
unchanged, but most of all, the Dow makes news _ and in the latest
case, history. The Dow, of course, is the Dow Jones industrial
average. Why it should get so much attention is a matter of
considerable debate, between those who see the Dow at 10,000 as
historic and those who see 10,000 as ``just a number.'' (Walker,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution). MOVED. WITH ILLUSTRATION
</P>
<P>
   DOW-FOURK _ Ordinary Americans, saving slowly and diligently for
their retirement years, helped push the Dow to 10,000 Tuesday.
Retirement accounts such as 401(k) plans now hold close to $1.4
trillion worth of stocks, or a 10th of the total value of U.S.
stocks. Add to that the stock investments in individual retirement
accounts and traditional pension plans, and the total shoots to an
estimated 30 percent of the total market value. (Ezell, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   DOW-WOMEN _ Women are claiming a stronger presence among
financial investors. (Luke, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). MOVED.

   FBN-IFL-WINSLOW _ DAYTON, Ohio _ Mention the name Kellen Winslow
to football fans of a certain age and a clear image leaps to mind
of this player, completely spent, white towel draped over his head,
being assisted from the field by two teammates. He had just driven
the San Diego Chargers past the Miami Dolphins, seemingly with
every fiber of his existence. Nary a day passes when he isn't
reminded of that Jan. 2, 1982 overtime playoff game. ``Good thing
we won,'' laughed Winslow, who played nine years as a tight end for
the Chargers and entered the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1995.
Tuesday, in his role as commissioner of the Indoor Foortball
League, Winslow helped the Dayton Skyhawks, newest of eight IFL
franchises, drum up interest for their inaugural 12-game season
beginning April 2 at Hara Arena against Green Bay. It's a far cry
from the NFL and Winslow admits he didn't know quite what to think
when approached about the job. But now he's thinking about further
expansion _ to 12 or 16 teams by next year _ and says a cable TV
deal for the league is possible, in part because ``networks are in
dire need of programming.'' (McClelland, Dayton Daily News) MOVED.

   BKC-LOWSCORES _ Heading into the Sweet 16, an interesting trend
has developed - teams are scoring points at an surprisingly low
rate. In the first 48 games of the tournament, only one team scored
more than 100 points and only five others have scored 90 points. On
the other hand, 15 teams scored in the 50s, three teams scored in
the 40s and SW Missouri State and Wisconsin combined to score only
75 points in a game. Is the low scoring a product of improved
defense or lack of shooters? It is likely a combination of both.

 By BRUCE WEBER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The tent in the vacant lot on the outskirts of
downtown is conspicuous but not particularly distinguished. It's
just a big white tent. Anything might be inside it; a farmer's
market, maybe, or a petting zoo or a traveling antique show. But
what goes on there four nights a week, a vaudevillian dinner
cabaret known as Teatro ZinZanni that has become this city's
hottest ticket, isn't even the biggest surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the show is odd enough. Imagine a slapstick movie being
filmed in a restaurant during dinner hour with deft clowns mingling
with waiters and various musicians, singers, dancers and posturing
actors (not to mention a juggler and a contortionist) making
frequent interruptions.
</P>
<P>
   The most disconcerting thing inside the tent may well be the
tent itself. Beneath the ordinary, inverted cones of white canvas
outside, it reveals itself inside to be a pretty good cross between
an old-style European beer hall and an old-style American saloon, a
round room complete with mirrored walls, wooden booths and dark,
heavy drapery to convey a lush and titillating sense of
roguishness.
</P>
<P>
   ``To build a theater in a place where nobody expected it, and to
create a whole unexpected world inside it, that was the idea,''
said Norman Langill, a local impresario whose production company,
One Reel, created Teatro ZinZanni _ the name is nonsensical, though
zanni is Italian for zany _ with an international cast of
performers for presentation specifically under this portable roof.
</P>
<P>
   Known as a Spiegeltent (Spiegel is German for mirror), it was
built in 1920. It is the oldest and, at about 72 feet across, among
the largest of the 12 surviving ones created by the Klessens family
of Belgium. It is the only one ever to make an extended visit to
the United States. The Klessens perfected an ingenious system of
locking pegs and rings and sliding rails that allows their tents to
be erected in a single day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key is there are no tools required,'' said Steve Quinn,
the production manager for One Reel, who received his tutelage in
tenting from Willy Klessens, the grandson of the inventor and the
head of the family business. The tent, which has 4,200 pieces and
weighs about 40,000 pounds, is supported by its own interior
tension, Quinn said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's about all I can say,'' he said. ``The design is a
trade secret. In Willy's mind, it's his Coca-Cola recipe.''
</P>
<P>
   What audiences react to is the startling interior that one
doesn't associate with a tent in a vacant lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a shock going from the outside to the inside,''
Langill said, that it prepares the audience for the other surprises
that await them. ``It appeals to me to present theater in an
ephemeral, Brigadoon style, create the theater along with the
show.''
</P>
<P>
   Evidently, that sense of dislocation has appealed to many other
Seattle residents as well. The show opened in October for a
scheduled six-week run, and despite an $88 ticket price (high for
entertainment in Seattle, even with a five-course dinner thrown
in), it has been extended at least through Memorial Day, and
Langill plans to take it on the road, probably to San Francisco or
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   To describe the show is tricky. Indeed, its subtitle, ``Love,
Chaos and Dinner,'' is spiritually accurate but hardly full of
clues. When a waiter innocently declared, ``The wine list is in
your program,'' the playful confusion began. Meanwhile, a clown
posing as a dishwasher (Nathalie Tarlet, an impish Frenchwoman),
circled the tables collecting champagne glasses, slowly commanding
the attention as the stack in her arms grew to several dozen and
she wobbled about unsteadily.
</P>
<P>
   It is a show loosely organized around the meal, with an actor,
Kevin Kent from Seattle, playing the chef and emerging to introduce
each course in the persona of a different character. Entering as an
evangelist with an assistant carrying a tureen, he opened the lid
and cried, as if to the heavens: ``I will fear no soup _ nor
consomme!'' (The kitchen, under the direction of an actual chef,
Monique Barbeau of Vancouver, performs admirably, cranking out 265
reasonably delicious meals all at once from a makeshift facility
built into a trailer.)
</P>
<P>
   Between (and during) courses, there is much singing (including a
handful of campy ballads, like ``The Man Who Got Away,'' delivered
by the full-throated Ann Wilson, formerly of the rock group Heart),
much slapstick clown work (including, of course, the public
ridicule of several audience members) and much music by a jazz band
whose members remain pointedly unperturbed by the raucous horseplay
around them.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a Ukrainian juggler, Sergey Krutikov, who at one
point balances an umbrella, a hat and a cigar on his instep, kicks
them into the air and catches them, respectively, in his hand, on
his head and in his mouth. And perhaps most notably there is
Aurelia Cats, a French contortionist who dresses in a cat suit
(could that possibly be a stage name?) and performs on a trapeze
with a manner that can only be described as insouciant. The whole
thing lasts about 3{ hours, and it isn't editorializing to say it
is nutty.
</P>
<P>
   But as Langill (pronounced LAN-jill) will tell you, it all works
because of the tent. As soon as you walk in, you're
discombobulated, he said. ``You walk in for dinner, and you look up
and you see the theater lighting all around you, and you go:
`Uh-oh. I'm onstage.'''
</P>
<P>
   A round, hirsute man and self-described hippie who looks
remarkably like a blond Jerry Garcia, Langill, 49, is an
iconoclastic showman, well known here as the producer of events
like the Bumbershoot Festival, an annual Labor Day weekend event
that features hundreds of dancers, musicians, actors and visual
artists in continuous performances on more than two dozen stages.
</P>
<P>
   Trained as a comic actor and long a fan of the disappearing art
of vaudeville, Langill came to Seattle from Milwaukee in the late
1960s to study acting at the University of Washington, where his
classmates included actors Pamela Reed, Kyle McLachlan, Patrick
Duffy and John Aylward. One Reel was formed in 1972 as a traveling
vaudeville show that performed in small towns all over the
Northwest. The company has grown in size and scope _ it produces
not only the mammoth Bumbershoot every year, but other festivals
and events as well _ and the players in Teatro ZinZanni were
assembled as part of the regular worldwide rounds of
talent-searching that go into putting those projects together.
Still, it took Langill six years to get the mix he wanted.
</P>
<P>
   But it all began in 1992 in Barcelona while he was there at the
Summer Olympics presenting a show that One Reel had created with a
Japanese theater troupe. He wandered into a tent on the Paseo de
las Ramblas, the city's main boulevard. It was the first Klessens
Spiegeltent he had ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walked in, and I felt as if I'd entered the nightclub of my
dreams,'' Langill said. ``I thought, `This is a whole new kind of
presentation.' It was vaudeville of the sort that doesn't exist any
more, the kind I'd been trying to imitate my whole life, even
though I'd never seen it.''

SENATORS ATTACK RENO DECISION AGAINST INDEPENDENT COUNSEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno, who has argued against
renewing the independent counsel act, took strong criticism
Wednesday from two senators, a Democrat and a Republican, for
refusing to name a special prosecutor to probe possible campaign
finance violations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision you made on campaign finance shows me that we
still need some type of independent counsel law,'' Sen. Joseph
Lieberman, D-Conn., told Reno at a Senate Governmental Affairs
Committee hearing on the future of the statute.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, Reno said she found no reasonable grounds to seek
the appointment of an independent counsel to investigate President
Clinton's role in the multi-million dollar Democratic fund-raising
campaign in 1996. Her decision was made despite the urgings of FBI
Director Louis Freeh and Charles LaBella, the former head of the
Justice Department's campaign finance task force, to appoint a
special prosecutor to probe the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Committee Chairman Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., said he could not
understand why Reno, who has recommended the appointment of seven
independent counsels during her six-year term, seemed so reluctant
to pull the trigger on the possible campaign finance violations.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some cases you have quickly called for an independent
counsel, but in other cases that I believe cry out for a special
prosecutor, you don't,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said she made her decision ``based on the law and the
facts'' and that she felt it was correct.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is that I would have been criticized no matter what
my decision was,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Reno told the Senate panel that she reconsidered her support for
the independent counsel law after many of her decisions on
appointing special prosecutors were ``plunged into the political
process.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The act was meant to instill public confidence in high-level
investigations ... and I believe it has not achieved that goal to
the level expected,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the Justice Department came out against the
statute, reversing the stance taken by the president and Reno five
year ago when they successfully lobbied for the law's renewal.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I began as attorney general ... I didn't account for the
focus and the immediate posture of any decision I made, to see it
plunged into the political process,'' Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   But Thompson challenged her, saying, ``Maybe it has to do just
with your decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   The independent counsel act will expire on June 30. So far,
those in favor of renewing the statute have found little support in
Congress for the law, which has led to investigations of both
Democratic or Republican administrations.
</P>
<P>
   At the hearing, Reno suggested that investigations into the
president and upper-level administration officials should be
handled by the Justice Department in a manner similar to the system
used before passage of the 1978 independent counsel act.
</P>
<P>
   Under that system, the attorney general would turn over credible
allegations against the president, vice president, most Cabinet
officials, the CIA director and the FBI director to the Justice
Department's Public Integrity Section. The section would
investigate the allegations and recommend whether a special
prosecutor should be appointed.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are career lawyers who are outside the political
process, which would ensure that a fair, thorough job was done,''
Reno said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The independent counsel law was passed in the wake of the
1972-1974 scandal triggered by a Republican break-in at the
Democratic Party headquarters in the Watergate Office Building
here.
</P>
<P>
   During a probe of the scandal President Richard Nixon ordered
the attorney general to dismiss special Watergate prosecutor
Archibald Cox after Cox refused to drop a subpoena for
incriminating tapes of Nixon's White House conversations about the
matter.
</P>
<P>
   The law requires the attorney general to seek appointment of an
independent counsel when there is substantial and credible evidence
of a crime by any one of 49 top federal officials, including the
president. A panel of three federal appellate judges then picks an
attorney for the job.

INVASION: SCI-FI CHANNEL EXPANDS ITS UNIVERSE WITH NEW
FRIDAY  LINEUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Check local listings for times)  
 By JOHN CARMAN  
 c. 1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   After seven years of relative obscurity, cable's Sci-Fi Channel
is taking a deep breath and plunking a ton of money onto the
screen.
</P>
<P>
   They call it the ``Sci-Fi 2.0 initiative'' _ the first time a TV
overhaul has been made to sound like a computer upgrade.
</P>
<P>
   It means a snappier image for a channel that had become schlocky
with campy sci-fi reruns. It means more original movies. Most of
all, it means a potent bloc of science-fiction series on Friday
nights.
</P>
<P>
   The big day is Friday, when the Sci-Fi Channel launches two new
series along with new episodes of ``Sliders'' _ that show is harder
to kill than Rasputin _ and ``Poltergeist: The Legacy.''
</P>
<P>
   The newcomers, ``Farscape'' and ``First Wave,'' are the linchpin
series. One sign is that the channel has lavished an unprecedented
66-episode commitment on ``First Wave,'' which is
executive-produced by Francis Ford Coppola.
</P>
<P>
   And the Sci-Fi Channel claims that ``Farscape,'' an
intergalactic fantasy featuring animatronic characters from the Jim
Henson Creature Shop, is the costliest series in basic cable
history.
</P>
<P>
   How costly? They're not saying; you just have to take their word
for it.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Farscape'' is a stunner, the most exotic show in the
batch, and a solid candidate to establish a new science-fiction
iconography two months before George Lucas splashes into movie
houses with his much-anticipated ``Star Wars'' prequel.
</P>
<P>
   Created by Rockne O'Bannon (``Alien Nation,'' ``SeaQuest DSV''),
``Farscape'' is filmed in Australia and stars Ben Browder (``Party
of Five'') as American astronaut John Crichton, a man who
experiences a major mishap.
</P>
<P>
   He's experimenting with using Earth's gravity to bolster the
speed of spacecraft. The experiment works all too well, propelling
Crichton through a wormhole and far into space, until he lands
aboard a prison ship whose strange alien occupants are trying to
escape their captors.
</P>
<P>
   Crichton's new companions: Ka D'Argo (Anthony Simcoe), a gruff
Luxan warrior more or less of the Chewbacca and Lt. Worf stripe;
Pa'u Zotoh Zhaan, a serene blue priestess from the planet Delvia;
Rygel XVI, a Henson concoction who is vain and the usurped ruler of
the Hynerian Empire; and Officer Aeryn Sun (Claudia Black), a
soldier captured by the refugees aboard the ship Moya. Which
happens to be a biomechanoid ``living ship.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems the Moya and its occupants are going to be on the run
from the ruthless Capt. Bialar Crais of the ``Peacekeeper'' forces.
</P>
<P>
   There may be a question whether the market for this type of show
is already worn down by the various ``Star Trek'' series and the
recently departed ``Babylon 5.''
</P>
<P>
   But if there's any remaining juice in the genre, ``Farscape''
could live long and prosper. The special effects are impressive,
the Henson workshop has produced an interesting foil in the
imperious Rygel and the show doesn't seem content standing still.
It's primed for action.
</P>
<P>
   If ``Farscape'' owes to ``Star Trek'' and ``Star Wars,'' ``First
Wave'' can trace its lineage back through ``The X-Files'' to ``The
Invaders'' and ``The Fugitive.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea, hardly original, is that our leading man learns of a
planned alien invasion of Earth, is framed by the invaders for the
murder of his wife and finds himself on the run from both the
invading enemies and from the earthly authorities.
</P>
<P>
   That's a frayed formula. But ``First Wave'' executes it sharply,
and with a few wrinkles of its own. And that 66-episode commitment
means a certain comfort level for viewers _ this show presumably
won't be departing any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian actor Sebastian Spence stars as Cade Foster, a former
safecracker turned corporate security salesman.
</P>
<P>
   To the invaders who are secretly infiltrating Earth, Cade is
Test Subject 117. They've identified 117 psychological archetypes
and are monitoring and manipulating all of them to test the
strength of their bodies and wills.
</P>
<P>
   (It figures that Subject 56, a tobacco lobbyist, was a real
wuss. He fell apart in only two weeks.)
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, Cade escapes the aliens hours before they can kill him
and dissect his brain. His wife (Stacy Grant) is dead, though the
aliens have slapped together a tentacled facsimile.
</P>
<P>
   Cade's road map for solving and stopping the alien conspiracy is
none other than the 16th-century soothsayer Nostradamus. He
prophesied the alien takeover, and now his writings give Cade his
only advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``First Wave'' has just enough new twists to make it moderately
intriguing, but I'm not sold on Spence. The character is a man with
a past, and hence a full load of emotional baggage. If not exactly
callow, Spence's Cade Foster does seem too young and unmarred.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the show's maternal grandmother is ``The Fugitive,''
in which a mere glimpse of David Janssen told you that this was a
man burdened with more than carry-on luggage.
</P>
<P>
   Yep, by jiminy, one thing you can say about TV today is that
they don't make archetypes like they used to.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, one of the problems is that they can hardly make them
at all.

BITTER TIDE: SITES THAT LOVE TO HATE

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At first glance, Nole's Page looks like any one of the thousands
of personal home pages digitally dashed upon the Internet by
adolescents with a modicum of computer skills and a hankering to be
noticed. The page, which claims to be all about Santa Barbara,
Calif., displays the name of the city, framed by American flags,
above torches that burn with animated fire. Along the left side of
the page are buttons directing viewers to some of Nole's favorite
things, including ``the beer of champions.''
</P>
<P>
   But visitors who scroll down, to the sound of rock power chords,
soon discover that the Web site is actually devoted to ``white
power.'' Nole's Page turns out to be a neo-Nazi rant peppered with
glowing references to skinhead ideology. It also has 50 links to
like-minded sites, from those selling Nazi memorabilia to tracts
about breaking ``the chains of Jewish materialism.''
</P>
<P>
   Another site, Martin Luther King Jr.: A Historical Examination,
appears to be a tribute to the civil rights leader, complete with
pictures of him and his family on the home page. A few mouse clicks
later, however, and King is labeled as ``just a sexual degenerate,
an America-hating Communist.''
</P>
<P>
   On yet another site, designed to look like a mainstream Internet
news service, there are stories about Jasper, Texas, where a black
man was dragged to his death behind a pickup truck. But this site
features a different take on Jasper, reporting that ``negroes and
race traitors'' had removed an old fence that in the view of the
writer had justly separated for more than 160 years the graves of
blacks and whites in a local cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   Each of these Web sites can also be found on Digital Hate 2000,
an interactive report on CD-ROM that is to be released Friday by
the Simon Wiesenthal Center, a research and educational
organization based in Los Angeles that is best known for its focus
on the Holocaust. The report is a guided tour of what Rabbi Abraham
Cooper, associate dean of the center, characterized as a subculture
of hate on the Internet. He said such sites were growing at an
alarming rate. ``What used to be done in the stalls of bathrooms is
now online,'' Cooper said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   The difference, people who track hate sites point out, is that
online hate propaganda can disguise itself more easily than
bathroom graffiti and mimeographed pamphlets.
</P>
<P>
   Digital Hate 2000 shows that many of the sites are little more
than traditional expressions of hate: pages of dense text arguing
things like the inherent inferiority of blacks and how the year
2000 computer glitch is part of a Jewish conspiracy to establish a
new world order. Online storefronts sell books by David Duke, the
former Ku Klux Klan leader who is running for the Republican
nomination for a congressional seat in Louisiana, along with Nazi
propaganda posters and Hitler's ``Mein Kampf.''
</P>
<P>
   But other sites, like the Santa Barbara and Martin Luther King
Jr. pages, are presented as ordinary home pages or educational
sites. ``Racist hate organizations are learning how to use this new
electronic media,'' said David Goldman, director of Hate Watch, a
volunteer Internet group that has been tracking hate speech on the
Internet for five years. Many sites operated by neo-Nazis,
skinheads, Ku Klux Klan members and followers of radical religious
sects are growing more sophisticated, offering inviting Web
environments that are designed to be attractive to children and
young adults.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a site for the World Church of the Creator, a
neo-Nazi group based in East Peoria, Ill., is rendered in bright
crayon colors. Three supporters of the church recently pleaded
guilty to charges of beating and robbing a Jewish businessman (they
said they had done it to raise money for the church). Until a few
weeks ago, the section of the site called Creativity for Children
linked to a vintage Nazi propaganda children's book that likens
Jews to ``poisonous mushrooms.''
</P>
<P>
   Another site features animation of blond-haired teen-agers
firing rifles at a poster of a pig that reads ``Kill the Jew Pigs
before it's too late.'' On another the cartoon teen-agers blast
holes in a poster of Pope John Paul II that has been digitally
altered to show a pistol in his right hand.
</P>
<P>
   Other sites offer popular computer games, like Doom and Castle
Wolfenstein, that have been reconfigured to include blacks, Jews
and other members of minority groups as targets. Even the Dancing
Baby, that ubiquitous computer animation that crossed into
prime-time television, has been reborn as the ``White Power Baby.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wiesenthal Center said it planned to produce 20,000 copies
of the CD-ROM report, which can link Internet users to all of the
sites it has identified. The center's report will be given free to
law enforcement agencies, educational institutions and the media.
Individuals can buy the report through the center's Web site for
$25.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the bottom line: They're not overthrowing America
tomorrow,'' Cooper said. ``They're still a limited fringe. But they
have established a significant, unprecedented beachhead in the
mainstream of our culture.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the issue of what to do about hate on the Internet, a
medium that is both heralded and notorious for its scarcity of
gatekeepers, is hardly clear-cut. Cooper and the Wiesenthal Center
advocate censorship of hate messages. Yet others, like officials of
the American Civil Liberties Union, argue that Americans' speech
must be protected in cyberspace by the Constitution as it is in any
other medium.
</P>
<P>
   Even determining exactly what qualifies as a hate site on the
Internet is unclear. The Wiesenthal Center last year found 1,426
sites on the Web that it termed ``problematic,'' meaning they were
either hate sites or sites that linked to hate sites. About 100
more have been found since the study was completed three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   But the Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery, Ala., which
also watches hate speech on the Internet, counted just 254 last
year. Mark Potok, editor of the law center's quarterly Intelligence
Report, said that the law center focused on what it considered to
be explicit examples of hate speech and only on sites based in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not trying to do an international listing,'' Potok
said. The Wiesenthal Center, by contrast, uses a much broader
definition of hate, and its CD-ROM breaks down the sites into 10
categories, from those affecting children to hate music, religious
extremism, Holocaust denial, militia groups, conspiracy and new
world order sites to pages offering recipes for bomb-making.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I say hate sites, I'm talking about those that in one way
or another are essentially attacking or denigrating the status of
entire groups _ whites, blacks, gays, Jews,'' Potok said.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter how hate sites are defined, those who keep watch
say the numbers are growing rapidly.Cooper said the Wiesenthal
Center found twice as many hate sites last year than when it issued
its first annual report in 1997. The Southern Poverty Law Center
noted a big jump as well, to 254 last year, up from 163 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman, of Hate Watch, said that a factor driving the growth is
the low cost: a Web site is far less expensive to create and
maintain than a newspaper or even an occasional newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   The Wiesenthal disk also notes that some of the most offensive
speech can be found in popular newsgroups, chat rooms and digital
communities encouraged by Internet portals. One such site, called
Aryan Geschweister (Brothers and Sisters), was listed in the Yahoo
Clubs area.
</P>
<P>
   When asked for comment about hate sites at Yahoo and the Aryan
site in particular, Mark Hull, producer of Yahoo Clubs, wrote in an
e-mail that its members must agree to Yahoo's ``terms of service.''
That includes an agreement not to use the service to ``promote
bigotry, racism, hatred or harm of any kind against any group or
individual.'' Hull also noted that the Aryan Geschweister site had
since been deleted.
</P>
<P>
   But does the removal of such sites amount to little more than
censorship of unpopular ideas?
</P>
<P>
   Cooper said hate messages were dangerous and should be removed
and that decency and common sense should be used on the Internet
much like it is in the mainstream press. He also said the
Wiesenthal Center had had more success in curtailing hate speech on
the Internet in nations like Canada, Britain and Germany _ nations
where hate speech is illegal _ than in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Siegel, executive director of the New York Civil
Liberties Union, opposes censorship of online hate. ``The Internet
should be an open, robust example of freedom of expression,'' he
said. ``The concept and the principle is that the hate groups have
First Amendment rights as they would have in the open marketplace
of ideas. So if you can say X, Y and Z on a street corner on a
platform with a microphone, then the same principles and rules
should apply on the Internet.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It is in the gray area between the positions of the Wiesenthal
Center and the American Civil Liberties Union where Don Black has
found considerable wiggle room. He is a 45-year-old former Grand
Dragon of the Ku Klux Klan and is widely considered the godfather
of hate speech on the Web. In a telephone interview from his home
in West Palm Beach, Fla., he said that he saw nothing offensive
about his white supremacist site, Stormfront, which was probably
the first Web site of its kind when it appeared in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are simply a white pride site,'' he said. ``We believe
white people have the right to promote their interests and their
values and their heritage just as other races have the same
rights.'' He also referred to his site, mostly constructed with
computer skills he learned while an inmate in a federal prison, as
``alternative news media.'' And like many Internet users, he said
he looked forward to the day when greater bandwidth would speed
access to the Net. The effect, he said, would permit his site to be
less like an electronic newspaper and more like a television news
network with video on demand.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Internet, Black said, people who shared his beliefs
had little opportunity to spread them other than through leaflets,
small newspapers and rallies. Today, he noted, a relatively
inexpensive Web site can reach millions.
</P>
<P>
   He said his site cost about $1,000 a month to operate. His
group, Stormfront, owns its own computer servers and so is not
dependent upon Internet service providers.
</P>
<P>
   One outcome of the growth of these sites, said Potok, of the
Southern Poverty Law Center, is that people who hold extremist
views no longer feel isolated. ``These people who felt like
outcasts and were angry at the world have a whole different outlook
on life now,'' Potok said. ``These people are getting in cars and
driving to rallies and meeting soul mates from the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   And while Potok said that the law center wanted dangerous and
offensive speech to be exposed, the organization did not endorse
censorship. ``It doesn't do any good,'' he said, ``to pretend that
it doesn't exist.''

 &HT;    WORK IS NO FAMILY VACATION
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Balancing work and family is more important to most
American workers than any other employment factor, including job
security, working conditions and relationships with co-workers and
bosses, according to a survey released today (Thursday).
</P>
<P>
   While job satisfaction is high in the current economy - 88
percent are satisfied with their job, 54 percent are ``very''
satisfied - 95 percent of the adults surveyed said they are
concerned that work takes too much time away from their families.
</P>
<P>
   In comparison, 71 percent said they worried about job security
and 88 percent cited working conditions as a concern in the latest
``Working Trends'' survey by the John J. Heldrich Center for
Workforce Development at Rutgers University and the Center for
Survey Research and Analysis at the University of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Although job satisfaction holds steady across income, race and
gender lines, ``these same working Americans are telling us that
there's still something fundamentally wrong with how they work
today, and they see ways it can change,'' said Carl Van Horn, the
Heldrich Center director.
</P>
<P>
   (Note to newspapers: Numbers from next four graphs can be broken
out as employees wish list chart)
</P>
<P>
   At the top of workers' wish list is more flexibility in
schedules. Eighty-seven percent said they would like flexible work
hours or days. Currently, 61 percent (CQ) of employers offer
flexible hours and 48 percent (CQ) have flexible days, according to
the survey.
</P>
<P>
   To help them cope with stress, workers would like more
employer-provided benefits, such as reimbursement for education or
training, which was cited by 69 percent. Some 49 percent cited
on-site child care, while 42 percent picked athletic facilities at
work.
</P>
<P>
   Another high priority for workers would be expanding
opportunities for telecommuting. Eight percent of all workers
telecommute now. Fifty-nine percent said they would if given the
opportunity, even though 45 percent said they believe it would
reduce their chances for career advancement.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the relatively high interest in telecommuting, only 17
percent of U.S. employers currently allow it.
</P>
<P>
   The survey showed that 29 percent of employees with
post-graduate degrees work for employers that permit telecommuting;
24 percent of those with undergraduate degrees do so. Only 11
percent of high school graduates work for employers who offer
telecommuting.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also found 46 percent said they work more than 40
hours a week. And a striking 87 percent reported not getting enough
sleep due to increased work demands.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rules of the new economy have created opportunity as well
as uncertainty,'' said Ken Dautrich (cq), director of the Center
for Research and Survey Analysis. ``Despite widespread job
satisfaction and the lowest unemployment rate in 30 years, anxiety
and stress levels associated with work remain high.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey results are based on telephone interviews of 1,000
adults randomly selected from the contiguous United States from
Feb. 5 through Feb. 22. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 3
percent. The ``Working Trends'' survey, conducted quarterly, does
not exclude the self- employed.

WHERE FANS OF KUBRICK CAN GRIEVE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich.)  (af)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   How does a community cope with loss? That was the question that
members of the Stanley Kubrick newsgroup, alt.movies.kubrick, were
asking themselves after the director of such films as ``A Clockwork
Orange,'' ``2001: A Space Odyssey'' and ``Dr. Strangelove,'' died
last week.
</P>
<P>
   For online devotees of the cerebral director, who was often
described as having a cold, unemotional vision, it was a rare
occasion to unload.
</P>
<P>
   ``There doesn't seem to be a sensible response,'' was the
beginning of the message left by Sweeny7 just hours after the
director's death. ``It seems impossible for this to have happened,
especially now. I just wonder what is the best, most concrete thing
that we could do? Not just in terms of preserving his cinematic
legacy but for his family, even for him personally.''
</P>
<P>
   A news group with a small and devoted following _ one that
prided itself on parsing detailed threads about a minor actor in
``A Clockwork Orange'' _ became transfixed by grief. The typical
stream of 5 to 10 daily messages rose to 250 on March 7, the day
Kubrick died.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of different reactions,'' said Steven
Brookenthal, 20, a sophomore at Michigan State University who
gained notice within the group for compiling a definitive
collection of Kubrick references on ``The Simpsons'' television
show. ``There was one man who said he had been crying for the next
couple of days. Some said, `Get a life,' '' Brookenthal said.
</P>
<P>
   Another contributor who returned to the group the day Kubrick
died was Barry Krusch, 40, who had helped assemble an encyclopedic
list of frequently asked questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the news group, you knew there were people all across the
planet who loved him as much you did,'' Krusch said. Like many in
the group, he considered the notion that the reclusive director
might have faked his own death.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was a hoax,'' he said, noting that Kubrick had
just completed editing his final film, ``Eyes Wide Shut.'' ``There
was no preparation and look at the timing _ he had just delivered
the film. It is uncanny, very fitting of his view of
synchronicity.'
</P>
<P>
   Ron Hunter recalled seeing ``2001'' in Omaha, when he was 11,
and sneaking in to see ``A Clockwork Orange'' when he was 15.
``Great films all. Thanks Kubrick,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   But, perhaps appropriately for a group that treated Kubrick's 12
films with an almost Talmudic assiduousness, many postings treated
the director's death as one more detail to be analyzed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now this is silly and trivial, signifying nothing so much as
my desperate need to get a life, and somebody should check my
arithmetic, but by jingles at least I'm the first to post it,''
wrote Ricky Fluke. ``I believe Kubrick passed away exactly 666 days
before the year 2001.'' &QL;

 &HT;    WORK IS NO FAMILY VACATION
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Balancing work and family is more important to most
American workers than any other employment factor, including job
security, working conditions and relationships with co-workers and
bosses, according to a survey released today (Thursday).
</P>
<P>
   While job satisfaction is high in the current economy - 88
percent are satisfied with their job, 54 percent are ``very''
satisfied - 95 percent of the adults surveyed said they are
concerned that work takes too much time away from their families.
</P>
<P>
   In comparison, 71 percent said they worried about job security
and 88 percent cited working conditions as a concern in the latest
``Working Trends'' survey by the John J. Heldrich Center for
Workforce Development at Rutgers University and the Center for
Survey Research and Analysis at the University of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Although job satisfaction holds steady across income, race and
gender lines, ``these same working Americans are telling us that
there's still something fundamentally wrong with how they work
today, and they see ways it can change,'' said Carl Van Horn, the
Heldrich Center director.
</P>
<P>
   (Note to newspapers: Numbers from next four graphs can be broken
out as employees wish list chart)
</P>
<P>
   At the top of workers' wish list is more flexibility in
schedules. Eighty-seven percent said they would like flexible work
hours or days. Currently, 61 percent (CQ) of employers offer
flexible hours and 48 percent (CQ) have flexible days, according to
the survey.
</P>
<P>
   To help them cope with stress, workers would like more
employer-provided benefits, such as reimbursement for education or
training, which was cited by 69 percent. Some 49 percent cited
on-site child care, while 42 percent picked athletic facilities at
work.
</P>
<P>
   Another high priority for workers would be expanding
opportunities for telecommuting. Eight percent of all workers
telecommute now. Fifty-nine percent said they would if given the
opportunity, even though 45 percent said they believe it would
reduce their chances for career advancement.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the relatively high interest in telecommuting, only 17
percent of U.S. employers currently allow it.
</P>
<P>
   The survey showed that 29 percent of employees with
post-graduate degrees work for employers that permit telecommuting;
24 percent of those with undergraduate degrees do so. Only 11
percent of high school graduates work for employers who offer
telecommuting.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also found 46 percent said they work more than 40
hours a week. And a striking 87 percent reported not getting enough
sleep due to increased work demands.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rules of the new economy have created opportunity as well
as uncertainty,'' said Ken Dautrich (cq), director of the Center
for Research and Survey Analysis. ``Despite widespread job
satisfaction and the lowest unemployment rate in 30 years, anxiety
and stress levels associated with work remain high.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey results are based on telephone interviews of 1,000
adults randomly selected from the contiguous United States from
Feb. 5 through Feb. 22. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 3
percent. The ``Working Trends'' survey, conducted quarterly, does
not exclude the self- employed.

journalist, Brian Barger had exposed misdeeds of Oliver North in
the Iran-contra scandal, uncovered a CIA assassination manual, and

life and career would take an abrupt and surprising turn. He was
dispatched to Juarez by the Cable News Network to cover the murders
of scores of poor young women and the specter of a serial killer.

``Dessert Circus at Home'' (William Morrow, $28). At the front of
the room, Torres, executive pastry chef at New York's Le Cirque
2000 restaurant, is carefully matching a list of supplies _
strawberries, grated chocolate, cake ring, piles and piles of sugar
_ with what he finds on the marble counter beside a sugar-sculpted
clown and a foot-high, glossy chocolate sculpture. Behind Torres,

BERNSTEIN   NOT READY TO GIVE UP THE DRIVER'S SEAT 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By   PAT DOOLEY The Gainesville Sun   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAINESVILLE, Fla. _ Maybe it will happen in Gainesville. One
day, Kenny Bernstein will climb out of bed and want to climb back
into it. He won't want to drive, won't want to feel the G-forces
pressing his body back into the seat, won't want to wash the smell
of nitro out of his hair.
</P>
<P>
   It would be fitting if it did happen here. It seems like
everything else has for Bernstein.
</P>
<P>
   But it won't happen this year and when it does happen, it will
be quick and without fanfare. No farewell tour, no parade. Don't
even try.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are already talking about something like that,'' he
said. ``They'll have to talk real hard.''
</P>
<P>
   At 54, Bernstein knows he's nearing the end of his career as a
drag racer. But as he prepares for the Mac Tools Gatornationals
that begin here Thursday he says he still goes into each event with
the enthusiasm of a rookie. That, coupled with the experience of 52
victories, makes him a threat at every event he competes in.
</P>
<P>
   The only driver to win season titles in both Top Fuel and Funny
Car showed that last year when he won Gatornationals in his
Budweiser Top Fuel car. And he will be a factor again this year.
That you can count on.
</P>
<P>
   For how long you can count on it is anyone's guess.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as I enjoy doing it, I will keep doing it,'' he said.
``I have to enjoy crawling in that car and competing. I'll wake up
one day and decide that's it. It's never going to be a question of
one more year. I'll get to the point where I don't want to do it
anymore. But I'm not the kind of guy who plans things out.''
</P>
<P>
   It was March 20, 1992, a little after 4 p.m. when it happened.
Bernstein became the first driver to exceed 300 mph. You knew it
would happen one day, but when, where and who were the questions.
Bernstein provided the answers at Gainesville Raceway that day
seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it doesn't seem that long ago,'' he said.
``Sometimes it does. It depends on how things are going. It's
amazing because now, everyone's going 300. But it was special. It's
part of why Gainesville is a special place for me.''
</P>
<P>
   That remarkable pass and four victories in Gainesville have made
him as popular as any driver at Gainesville Raceway. Go by his pit
sometime, anytime, and watch the fans gawking for a peek at his
car, his crew, himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``We love Gainesville. We love the people,'' Bernstein said.
``We really enjoy coming back. It has always been a special
place.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a special win for Bernstein last year when he qualified
fifth, but won all four elimination races to claim the title.
</P>
<P>
   It could have been a victory that propelled Bernstein to another
Winston points championship. It would have been his sixth and
second straight in Top Fuel. But too many early failures during the
season left him in fourth behind eventual champion Gary Scelzi.
</P>
<P>
   What exactly went wrong, Bernstein wishes he knew.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I did, we'd fix it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So far this season, Bernstein is second in the points standings
behind Mike Dunn after two races. But he'd like some more
consistency in his car.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gotten lucky a few times,'' he said. ``You can't count
on the breaks all the time. We're actually in better shape than we
deserve. Last year, we had a lot of first-round failures. That puts
you out of the running for the championship. I like our chances in
the semifinals and finals, but we have to get there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our car's not quite as quick and as fast as I'd like it to be.
We're running 4.6s and we gotta be in the 4.55s.''
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein remains motivated to win. He's not going to rest on
his past success.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to realize it's gone, in the past,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He's gone into 26 of them with that same attitude. What's done
is done. What lies ahead, nobody knows for sure. All we know is
that Kenny Bernstein will keep driving, keep competing, until he
doesn't feel it anymore.
</P>
<P>
   That day will be a sad one for the National Hot Rod Association.
They couldn't find a better ambassador for their sport, a press
release in a jump suit. Don't count on it ending too soon. The look
is still in his eye, the fire in his gut.
</P>
<P>
   And when he's in Gainesville, he's as dangerous as any of the
drivers competing.
</P>

ACADEMY RECOGNITION OF KAZAN REOPENS AN OLD WOUND
</HEADLINE>
 (Resend for Riverside Press Enterprise. This story was for use
Sunday, March 14 by NYTimes News Service) 
By BOB STRAUSS  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Despite all the talk of wide-open Oscar races this
year, the most suspenseful moment at the 71st Academy Awards
ceremonies March 21 will come when 89-year-old Elia Kazan accepts
an honorary award for his distinguished body of work.
</P>
<P>
   There's a very good chance that the director of such acclaimed
movies as ``A Streetcar Named Desire,'' ``On the Waterfront'' and
``East of Eden,'' the stage genius who was probably more
responsible than any other individual for making the naturalistic
Method the dominant acting style in American movies, will be
greeted by silence, by only scattered applause or, even, by
catcalls.
</P>
<P>
   That's because, while few if any would question that Kazan was a
great and highly influential filmmaker, many have never forgiven
him for naming names to the House Un-American Activities Committee
in 1952, at the height of Washington and Hollywood's anti-communist
witch hunts.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of film-industry careers were damaged during the
McCarthy era. Those accused of, to paraphrase the government's
official question, now or having ever been members of the American
Communist Party, were given the damnable choice of either naming
colleagues and friends who had also been party members or, by not
informing, being blacklisted. Landing on the latter, secret roster
meant that individual would no longer be employed in the movie
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Kazan, whose brief membership in the party in the mid-1930s
genuinely soured him on communism, was the highest-profile liberal
to name names. Like many who cooperated with HUAC, he surely
despised the horrors of Stalinism and was concerned about America's
safety at the height of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike others who buckled before the committee in order to
save their careers, Kazan has refused to apologize for his actions
since. Indeed, the day after his testimony, he took out an ad in
The New York Times that rationalzed his decision on political
grounds. The first film Kazan made after testifying was the
anti-communist ``Man on a Tightrope.'' The next one, ``On the
Waterfront,'' for which he won his second directing Oscar (the
first was for the 1947 expose of anti-Semitism ``Gentleman's
Agreement''), makes the most indelible case for whistle-blowing in
all of cinema.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder, then, that while the academy maintains the honorary
award was (and should be by others) considered purely in the spirit
of artistic merit, its action has rekindled 50-year-old animosities
and detonated a mushroom cloud of heated debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's interesting that the academy _ which, normally, goes out
of its way to avoid controversy, particularly politically related
controversy _ is willing to stick its neck out in this instance,''
observes ``Entertainment Tonight'' film critic Leonard Maltin.
``Obviously, in doing so, they are trying to say that there are two
separate issues here. I kind of think they're right. But at the
same time, I wasn't around then, my life and career were not ruined
as a result of that witch hunt. I don't take lightly at all the
still-smoldering emotions that go with this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't understand why they feel compelled to do this;
all they're doing is opening old wounds,'' adds Rick Jewell,
associate dean of the Universty of Southern California's Film
School. ``If Kazan had never won an Oscar, then it would be a
different story because his artistic output is certainly worthy of
this kind of recognition. But since he won two of them, I just
don't get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, while there certainly have been exceptions to the rule,
by far the majority of honorary Oscars have been given to the likes
of Alfred Hitchcock and Charlie Chaplin, major talents who
unaccountably failed to win competitive Oscars during their
distinguished careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they're trying to do, I guess, is to put a period to this
whole, inflammatory history,'' Jewell says of the academy's Board
of Governors, which reportedly voted unanimously to give Kazan the
honorary award at the urging of the director's longtime friend and
collaborator (and past academy president), Karl Malden. ``Instead,
they've just caused it to flare up again.''
</P>
<P>
   Abraham Polonsky and Edward Dmytryk were deeply affected by the
blacklist. Polonsky, whose script for the 1947 ``Body and Soul''
was nominated for an Oscar, made his directing debut with the
highly acclaimed film noir ``Force of Evil'' a year later.
Blacklisted for refusing to divulge his political connections to
HUAC, he didn't direct again for 21 years.
</P>
<P>
   Dmytryk was a member of the Hollywood Ten, a group of writers,
producers and directors whose refusal to cooperate with the
committee led to their being imprisoned for contempt of Congress.
But Dmytryk had a change of heart, became one of HUAC's star
witnesses and resumed his directing career, during which he made
such admired '50s films as ``Broken Lance,'' ``The Caine Mutiny''
and ``The Young Lions.''
</P>
<P>
   Polonsky, 88, is among a group of blacklist survivors who are
encouraging Oscar ceremony attendees not to applaud when Kazan is
feted at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gave in to the House committee, gave them the names of
friends and people he knew so he wouldn't be blacklisted, but they
were,'' Polonsky says of Kazan. ``I consider that immoral conduct.
But they say the award has nothing to do with a person's moral
conduct. In other words, if you are a mass murderer but you write a
good picture, the academy a right to give you an award for deeds
well done.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my mind, it's illogical that a great artist doesn't have a
morality and a point of view that goes into his work. That's why I
think the whole thing is a mess.''
</P>
<P>
   The 91-year-old Dmytryk argues that Kazan, like himself, was
indeed operating on moral principle when he told HUAC all that he
knew.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's long past time to (give Kazan) this award,'' Dmytryk
says. ``And I think the academy is being very courageous because I
know how much courage it takes. It's great in all ways; I don't
have any exceptions like so many people do, great work but lousy
politics. His politics were also good; he helped to undermine the
Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing I want to make clear: The producers met on Nov. 25,
1947, and laid out the proposition, which they adopted, that nobody
who was a communist or an ex-communist could work in the business
at all unless they recanted. Now, that's long before Kazan
testified. In other words, the blacklist was not his fault or my
fault or anybody else's fault. So the constant blame that's been
made about the horrible things that happened to these families
because of the blacklist has been directed at the wrong people.''
</P>
<P>
   It's always been a quagmire of conflicting recriminations.
Hollywood communists often did support, or at least made excuses
for, Stalin's brutally repressive Soviet regime. Still, to
persecute members (or, more so, former members) of a legally
constituted political party, was, well, un-American in the extreme.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our whole system of government is based on the whole idea that
you don't shut people up this way, that you have a right to have
your opinion,'' Polonsky notes.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, as Kenneth Lloyd Billingsley, the politically
conservative author of the highly critical study of communism in
the film community ``Hollywood Party,'' points out, ``Let's not
forget, this is the movies, this isn't the government. There's no
constitutional right to a lifelong, lucrative job as a screenwriter
in Hollywood.''
</P>
<P>
   And then again, as the widespread public disdain for Linda Tripp
proves, Americans have a fundamental revulsion for snitches.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, there are reasonable rebuttals to the more
hyperbolic claims of both the left and the right. It's doubtful,
for example, that the eight people Kazan named before the committee
were hurt any more, at that point, than they already were. Most
historical accounts agree that these individuals were already known
to HUAC's investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, the fact that, at the time, America was strongly
anti-communist takes the wind out of the argument that justified
the whole Hollywood inquisition: that red influence in the movies
was somehow subverting the republic from within.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to ask Kazan, `Do you really think these people were
dangerous, a threat to this country?' '' says Richard Walter,
chairman of the screenwriting program at the University of
California, Los Angeles. ``They were self-important and, probably,
incredibly pompous, but a threat to this nation? Where is the
damage that they did?''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever damage the Kazan honor does _ to individuals for whom
its brought back painful memories, to the academy's reputation or,
perhaps, to whomever agrees to present the honorary Oscar (noting
that it never reveals who will present which award, the academy
would not confirm widespread rumors that impeccably credentialed
liberals Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro are the designated
presenters) _ there could be a silver lining to the whole
imbroglio.
</P>
<P>
   Much as the recent, agonizing impeachment proceedings and Orange
County video store protests triggered extensive examinations of
freedom, morality and law, the highly publicized Kazan controversy
could lead to a wider and deeper understanding of those troubled
blacklist times _ a period which, as Hollywood Ten member Dalton
Trumbo famously noted, produced only victims.
</P>
<P>
   Director Ulu Grosbard (``The Deep End of the Ocean''), who
worked with Kazan in the 1960s, expresses an objective attitude
shared by many who appreciate the devastating complexities of that
trying time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found him very charming. I got a good deal out of working
with him. I liked him,'' Grosbard says of Kazan. ``Yet you were
always aware of what he did. It's difficult. I'm conflicted about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Del Reisman, a past president of the Writers Guild of America,
currently sits on the guild's Blacklist Credits Committee. The
committee has researched and assigned proper credit to 82 films
that were written under pseudonyms or through a front by
blacklisted writers between 1948 and 1961. Six new corrections were
announced last week to somewhat more media attention than usual.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't really timed (to capitalize on the Kazan
controversy); however, people make that implicit connection, which
is fair,'' Reisman says. ``It's just there. I think that there will
be more public awareness about the blacklist now. It does bring it
to the fore because of Kazan's prominence.''
</P>
<P>
   Which may, in the long run, be good for society. Although of
course, some would understandably rather forget, if not forgive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm irritated, but not cast down by this,'' Polonsky says,
``because I know, having lived a long life, that one of the things
I can always count on is that whatever happens will be
frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   Polonsky laughs, but there's no mistaking the sad resignation in
his voice when he says, ``I thought the blacklist was over with.
Now I find out it's still alive.''

THE SPORT THAT'S FASTER THAN A JET FIGHTER

 (DUPLICATION NOTICE: Also filed in category `s')

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   GAINESVILLE, Fla. _ Take your 100 mph fastballs. Forget about
your Indy racers, your jet fighters and your spaceships, too. They
are all icebergs when compared to National Hot Rod Association drag
racers.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the fastest-accelerating creations in the world,''
said Don Robertson, general manager of Gainesville Raceway and
point man for the Mac Tools Gatornationals. ``They're faster than
an F-15 flying off an aircraft carrier. People ask, `Faster than
the space shuttle?' Yes, faster than the space shuttle.''
</P>
<P>
   Gatornationals, one of the NHRA Winston Drag Racing Series'
longest-running events, turns 30 this year and shows no signs of
slowing down _ and that's whether you're talking about the raw
speed spectacle or the more than 100,000 speed worshippers who come
to experience it. Qualifying races begin Thursday and the final
race is Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Although corporate sponsorship is a major force in the sport
today, there are many drivers who don't have big backing. They
invest huge amounts of time, work and money in their cars, trucks
and bikes.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, despite continually improving safety features, they
pay a price by being seriously injured, or even killed. But they
know that risk is part of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The element of danger might be part of the attraction for
spectators. But I think if the drivers had their choice, they'd
like to drive 300 mph in perfectly safe conditions,'' said Mike
Lewis, a former driver and NHRA announcer who has been a part of
every Gatornationals. ``The Top Fuel and Funny Car people are like
Chuck Yeager in the X-1 days. They're in uncharted territory.''
</P>
<P>
   It's always been that way for Gatornationals and drag racing in
general.
</P>
<P>
   The NHRA was already a few years old when organization founder
Wally Parks toured the newly built Gainesville Raceway in 1969 and
approved a new event. The other venues were in the West; one in the
South made sense, in part because of the weather.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Gainesville became a meeting point, not only for
rival racers, but also for merchandisers and distributors to show
new wares and make contacts, and for car buffs to get away from the
chill of March.
</P>
<P>
   Times in the early years were slow by today's standards. But it
wasn't long before Gainesville and Gatornationals gained a
reputation for hospitality and a fast track.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd all come to town and there would be billboards welcoming
us,'' Lewis said. ``People really made us feel special when we came
to Gainesville, whether they were the hotel people, law enforcement
or the community in general. It probably helped that it was also
very fun for the people coming out of the cold weather.''
</P>
<P>
   On the track, Don ``Big Daddy'' Garlits became the first
dominant figure. He won the first of four Top Fuel titles in 1972,
running a 6.17-second lap at 243.90 mph. He set the pace through
the '70s with two more championships at Gainesville.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, Garlits came back with the radically designed JP-1,
which he said was designed to ``punch a hole in the atmosphere,
allowing the rest of the car to drive through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Only Garlits knows if he truly entered another dimension, but
the car did blow away previous course records with a 5.503-second
lap at 268.65 mph, good for his fourth Gatornationals win.
</P>
<P>
   Don ``The Snake'' Prudhomme was to Funny Cars in the early years
what Garlits was to Top Fuel _ the best and the fastest at
Gainesville and a huge crowd favorite. He won three titles in the
'70s. In 1975, his Monza ran 6.52 at 172.74 _ more than a second
better than Dale Funk's winning elapsed time of that year in Top
Fuel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every now and then the funny cars catch up and the dragsters
pick themselves up and assert themselves again,'' Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   Enough numbers. You want human interest? How about a father-son
story.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Connie and Scott Kalitta met in the final of the Top
Fuel competition. Scott was faster in the early rounds, but Dad was
faster when it counted _ in the final.
</P>
<P>
   Drag racing is one of the few sports where age and gender truly
don't matter. This has been proved often at Gatornationals, where
Eddie Hill won his second consecutive Top Fuel title in 1993 _ at
age 57.
</P>
<P>
   In the early '90s, Warren Johnson ruled the pro stock category,
winning here every year from 1991 to 1994. Toss in his victories in
1984 and '85 and you have the most dominant Gatornationals racer in
any class.
</P>
<P>
   Today, at an age when many mull retirement, Johnson, 55, still
works on getting that extra microsecond. Johnson won again at
Gainesville last year _ one of his nine victories during the 1998
Winston Series.
</P>
<P>
   Woman-driver jokes don't fly at Gainesville Raceway, but woman
drivers do. Shirley Muldowney captured Top Fuel honors in 1981 and
1982. In 1990 Vonnie Mills and Janice Siegal won in Super Gas and
Super Comp, respectively. Mills was injured when her '88 Beretta
caught fire at the end of her final run, but she returned from the
hospital in time to be honored at the winners' circle.
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The recent performance exploits of John Force in Funny Cars, and
Kenny Bernstein and Joe Amato in Top Fuel, are well-documented;
they've paved the way to make 300 mph passes as close to routine as
anything can be in the sport.
</P>
<P>
   Some drag racing veterans say the increased speeds are mostly
due to big-money sponsorship allowing the best in technology.
</P>
<P>
   Although tracks, especially Gainesville, are safer now, and drag
racing does have a bit of a video game feel to it because of the
high-tech aspect, the sport is still tough _ and still dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Darrell Gwynn. In 1989 and '90, he won Top Fuel at
Gainesville and was the NHRA's rising star. But he was paralyzed
below the chest and lost part of an arm at an exhibition in England
one month after his 1990 Gatornationals win. Gwynn later made an
emotional return to Gainesville as a team manager and car owner.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who still doesn't believe the danger only has to look
back to 1997 and Al Hofmann. He came to Gatornationals that year
without corporate backing and had lost ace crew chief Tom Anderson.
He left with a Funny Car victory but with terrible injuries as his
car caught fire at the end of his victorious run.
</P>
<P>
   ``The engine let go near the finish line,'' Lewis said. ``The
resulting fire burned away the parachutes and exploded the rear
tires, sending Hofmann on a collision course with the top-end
guardrail.
</P>
<P>
   When the team should have been sipping champagne, they found
themselves gathered instead at the hospital to comfort Hofmann.
``The financial gain of the victory was wiped out and Hofmann
required months to recover from his injuries,'' Lewis said
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Hofmann was back competing at Gainesville.
</P>
<P>
   Now that's tough.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's the allure of drag racing. In most sports, pure
speed is a natural gift _ a God-given talent that a few have and
most cannot even dream to attain.
</P>
<P>
   In drag racing, the fastest of sports, there is, of course, some
natural ability involved _ reflexes are of paramount importance.
But so are teamwork, technology and tenacity. Drag racing success
today comes from a marriage of Space Age wizardry and undeniable
human spirit. Speed thrills _ especially when it's obvious some
work was put into it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The status quo is never good enough in this sport,'' said
Robertson, the general manager of Gainesville Raceway. ``Drag
racers are by nature a very innovative, cutting-edge type of group.
It's never a sport of complacency.''
</P>
<P>
   Age 30 is when the speed merchants in other sports start slowing
down. But, born in 1970, Gatornationals will just get faster and
faster.`

SEARCH FOR PAST TURNS UP A FAMILY IN THE PRESENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPEZZANO DELLA SILA, Italy _ Rosellina bounds up the marble
stairs with a squeal and a giggle.
</P>
<P>
   A giddy smile lights up her dark brown eyes. She twirls around
in her stylish black boot-cut pants. My 15-year-old Italian cousin
must be excited, I assume, about an evening stroll in the piazza
with her sweetheart.
</P>
<P>
   Think again. Even in this village of 5,000 in remote southern
Italy, Leonardo DiCaprio wields far more seductive power than any
``ragazzo,'' or boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Titanic!'' she shrieks, pronouncing it ``tee-tah-neek.'' She
waves around a pirated videotape of the American movie. A gift from
a classmate.
</P>
<P>
   In seconds, the whole family is gathered around the TV, watching
the herky-jerky, static-filled, copy-of-a-copy video. Rosellina and
her 14-year-old sister, Patrizia, sing along in English with the
theme song, and it occurs to me that in Italy, even Celine Dion
sounds good.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the song that always sounded so corny back home seems
more poignant and meaningful:
</P>
<P>
   ``Near, far, wherever you are, I believe that the heart does go
on ...''
</P>
<P>
   I TRAVELED TO Italy for the first time last fall. I was looking
for the past but found something even better _ an unforgettable
present.
</P>
<P>
   I went there, courtesy of a journalism fellowship from Columbia
University, to explore the homeland and history of my paternal
grandparents, who immigrated to Texas from Calabria, a rugged,
mountainous region deep in southern Italy.
</P>
<P>
   My grandparents both died before I was born. For hints about who
they were, I had often studied their black-and-white wedding
picture, taken in the early 1900s.
</P>
<P>
   Assunta's thick brown hair is pulled back into a tidy bun. Her
pretty dark eyes are wide with the expectations of a 20-year-old
woman. My grandfather Vito stands proudly in a black suit and
bristly black mustache.
</P>
<P>
   In 1921, they left this village to build a better life in
America.
</P>
<P>
   They were among 195,037 southern Italians who crossed the
Atlantic that year _ according to the U.S. National Archives _ to
escape problems such as poverty, political corruption and the
stranglehold of organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   For years, I had imagined what their Italian village was like
and dreamed of visiting it. I wondered if modern-day Spezzano would
be a sleepy town paralyzed by 'Ndrangheta, the Calabrian wing of
the Mafia, with crumbling buildings and elderly residents, where
the young people had all moved north or to America.
</P>
<P>
   Before I left on my trip, a Texas relative had remarked that
there were probably nothing but ``old fogeys'' left there.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, I found a delightful blend of old and new, rustic and
modern, in a region rarely visited by American tourists. First, I
met Salvatore, my father's first cousin, whose parents had remained
in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to say which side of the family has the ``better''
life today.
</P>
<P>
   Salvatore, a retired truck driver in his 70s, was a robust slice
of the old world. A proud patriach, he picked me up at the bus stop
in a sturdy blue 31-year-old Fiat.
</P>
<P>
   He showed off the three cozy homes he built for his family. He
drove us past ``Seattle Blues,'' a bar opened by Seattle residents
and restaurant owners Rhonda and Gianfranco Bafaro in their native
Spezzano. He gave me a tour of his lush garden filled with tomatoes
(for sauce), grapes (for wine) and enough fruits and vegetables to
help feed his entire clan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guardi,'' he'd say in his tobacco-roughened voice. ``Look.''
And he'd pull a bunch of grapes from the vine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mangi,'' he'd command with a smile. ``Eat.'' And he'd peel a
sweet fig for me. For this American city girl, who'd never tasted a
fig that wasn't Newton'd, it was like paradise.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, his teenage grandchildren wore Levis jeans, Doc
Marten boots and blue nail polish.
</P>
<P>
   They swooned over the Backstreet Boys and battled like American
siblings over telephone privileges.
</P>
<P>
   On a trip to Calabria's majestic pine forest, La Sila, to pick
mushrooms for pizza, they popped in a cassette, turned up the car
stereo's volume and sang along with Natalie Imbruglia's ``Torn'' as
we whizzed in a Fiat along the autostrada.
</P>
<P>
   Later, 10-year-old Fabio pointed to a page in my American
Entertainment Weekly magazine and correctly identified a picture of
a smiling brunette.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monica Lewinksy?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Life in this village was far from ``old fogey.''
</P>
<P>
   THE WORD ``SOLITUDE'' doesn't seem to exist in the Calabrese
vocabulary. Unlike in America, extended families here stay close
together.
</P>
<P>
   Very close, by U.S. standards.
</P>
<P>
   On a sun-drenched hillside, Salvatore has built three homes _
one for himself and his wife, and two for their grown daughters _
Maria and Antonietta _ and their families.
</P>
<P>
   Cousins live within shouting distance and seem more like
siblings. Grandparents live across a small driveway. Two of the
homes are connected by a balcony, which the kids climb over to
visit with each other.
</P>
<P>
   Salvatore's seven grandchildren range in age from 9-year-old
Valeria (who has a Barbie doll she named ``Cindy Crawford'') to
23-year-old Rossana, who studies economics at a nearby university
and has a boyfriend who rides a moped and plays soccer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are always together,'' teenager Rosellina explains.
</P>
<P>
   It seems so different from America, where sons and daughters
often move across the country and cousins rarely see each other
outside of holidays, weddings and funerals. My Italian relatives
are shocked that I must hop on a plane to visit my family in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   It takes a while for me, an only child accustomed to the
all-American sacrament of privacy, to adjust to constant
togetherness.
</P>
<P>
   One night I decide to take a solo walk before dinner. Apparently
this is rare in Calabria, especially for a young woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going alone?'' my cousins ask, puzzled. They all watch
from the balcony as I make my way down the road.
</P>
<P>
   But after a few days, the close-knit lifestyle feels cozy and
fun, and I find myself relaxing in and enchanted by this cocoon of
family.
</P>
<P>
   The food, by all means, helps my assimilation.
</P>
<P>
   Thick hunks of lasagna baked with tomato sauce, prosciutto, peas
and cheese. Main courses of chicken and veal. Glasses of strong red
wine made from the garden's grapes. For dessert: sweet, fresh figs
picked from the trees outside. Finally, after what seems like hours
at the table, tiny cups of strong Italian coffee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mangi, mangi, sei magra,'' the older women prod. ``Eat, eat,
you are too thin.'' It's like something out of a movie.
</P>
<P>
   The dinner table is always lively. Filippo, Maria's husband,
jokes so much, his daughters _ Rosellina, Patrizia and Valeria _
roll their eyes and laugh, ``Papa! Basta!'' Chill out, Dad!
</P>
<P>
   A 48-year-old wiry Sicilian, Filippo grills me about life in
America. What is the weather like? Is your house made of brick or
wood? Do you work? Why aren't you married if you live with your
boyfriend? What does your father do? Do you eat pasta in the United
States? Are most Americans fat?
</P>
<P>
   Mama mia! So many questions. But whenever I get my point across
in Italian, Filippo's eye's crinkle as he smiles and shouts,
``Perfetto!'' Perfect.
</P>
<P>
   He asks about differences between America and Italy. In the
midst of a boisterous crowd and unfamiliar language, I'm a bit
speechless. Off the top of my head, I blurt out my first thought _
seedless grapes.
</P>
<P>
   The table erupts in laughter.
</P>
<P>
   TRADITIONAL, CONSERVATIVE and buried deep in the toe of Italy's
boot, Spezzano is far removed, both geographically and culturally,
from Italian cities to the north, such as Rome and Milan.
</P>
<P>
   However attuned the young southern Italians are to American
fashions, music and movies, this remains a village where residents
revere patron saint Francesco di Paola (shrines to him are found in
every household and business), where people attend Mass every
Sunday and women live with their parents until marriage.
</P>
<P>
   One night I hear high-pitched, female screaming from the
driveway between the three houses. We all rush to our respective
balconies to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   It's Roberta, an 18-year-old cousin with smooth black hair and
olive skin. She screams at her mother in a flurry of Italian and
angrily stamps her foot.
</P>
<P>
   She is upset, I learn, because she can't go on a drive with her
boyfriend. Girls here are forbidden from riding in cars with boys,
lest they get a reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where do they want to go?'' I ask.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the piazza,'' Rosellina explains.
</P>
<P>
   The plaza is only five minutes away. I am reminded again of
where I am _ a very conservative village in southern Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the young people here seem happy, and there's a mutual
respect between youths and elders. Grandchildren actually have
conversations with their grandparents. Valeria, 9, carries in some
wood for the fireplace without being asked. My cousins say they
don't ever want to leave _ very different from America, where many
small-town teens can't wait to flee to the big city.
</P>
<P>
   My last night at Maria's, I leave the family a sharp,
store-bought copy of ``Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   Patrizia paints my fingernails blue, and the teenage girls and I
teach each other a few off-color words in each other's languages.
For a moment, I feel guilty for corrupting them. They just laugh
and teach me another.
</P>
<P>
   My heart breaks when it's time to leave. I wonder when I will be
able to see them again, this warm family that has made me feel like
one of the sorelle, or sisters.
</P>
<P>
   This might have been my life, I think, if my grandparents had
remained in Italy. Certainly, I probably have had more
opportunities and freedom than my Italian cousins. On the other
hand, they seem healthier, happier and far more grounded than most
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   It took a trip to Italy to really learn about family, and the
prime role it plays in both my cultures (Italian and Mexican). To
finally understand where my parents were coming from all these
years, why family has always been so important to them, why they
seemed to take it personally when I moved out of town, then out of
Texas, then 2,000 miles away for my jobs in journalism.
</P>
<P>
   After all, friends drift apart. Jobs end. Cities lose their
romance. In the end, family remains _ if you're lucky, with a cup
of espresso and a smile.
</P>
<P>
   My cousins in Italy know this by heart. Their culture has
preserved it.
</P>
<P>
   It took me a little longer to get the point. I had to cross the
Atlantic to finally come home.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   A slow-moving storm will drift north from the Rio Grande Valley,
resulting in widespread rain over Texas and Oklahoma. Flooding
downpours will accompany strong thunderstorms which will erupt over
central and eastern sections during midday and in the afternoon.
Farther west, areas of heavy, wet snow will occur from the higher
terrain of northeastern New Mexico to the panhandles of Texas and
Oklahoma. Drier air will surge into the Rio Grande Valley during
the day. Farther north, high pressure will promote mild and dry
conditions over most of the central and northern Plains. The rain
area will move north through Kansas Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Breezy and mild conditions will persist ahead of a cold front
near the Northeast coast. In the wake of the front, windy and
chilly weather will spread from the Midwest into the interior
Northeast. Most of the Northeast will stay dry with a mixture of
clouds and sun, although a few widely separated showers will occur
near the Appalachians as the front passes.
</P>
<P>
   High pressure east of Florida will keep most of the Southeast
warm and dry. Clouds will increase over the Tennessee and lower
Mississippi Valleys as a front arrives from the north. Otherwise,
ample sunshine will prevail.
</P>
<P>
   In the West, mild weather with abundant sunshine will linger
over most of the interior. Clouds will thicken near the Northwest
coast as a vigorous Pacific low pressure area approaches. Rain will
arrive over southwestern Oregon and northern California where
onshore winds develop.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Massive Storm
</P>
<P>
   A massive, powerful storm system bore down on Alaska's Pribilof
and Aleutian Islands Wednesday, armed with winds gusting to
hurricane force. Any comparison between hurricanes and winter
storms ends there. Hurricanes, which derive their energy from large
amounts of heat released when water vapor in sultry, tropical air
condenses, concentrates its fiercest winds in a small region around
the eye. Winter storms, which derive their energy from temperature
contrasts over the middle latitudes, spread their strongest winds
over a much larger region much farther away from the core of the
storm.

CONGRESSIONAL PANEL SAYS MALE-FEMALE MILITARY TRAINING O.K.
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Army, Navy and the Air Force should continue to
train male and female recruits together and allow them to live in
coed housing, according to a preliminary congressional commission
report released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The findings are a blow to conservative House Republicans who
have urged the military to train and house men and women separately
as is done in the Marine Corps.
</P>
<P>
   The Congressional Commission on Military Training and
Gender-Related Issues, which includes former Defense Department
officials and retired military personnel, was created in 1997 in
the wake of military sex scandals. One such scandal, revealed in
late 1996, involved drill instructors engaging in sexual relations
with recruits at the Army's Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problems of the past ... were created by serious failures
in leadership,'' said commission member Robert Dare, a retired Army
command sergeant major. ``They were clearly not a result of men and
women in a training environment.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission, however, was not unanimous in its recommendation
that the Army, Navy and Air Force continue to train men and women
together and in recommending that the Marine Corps maintain its
separate approach.
</P>
<P>
   The panel voted 6 to 1 in favor of the recommendation and three
members abstained. The panel, however, was ideologically polarized
from the beginning as Republicans and Democrats each had a role in
selecting the panel.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Stephen E. Buyer, R-Ind., chairman of the House Armed
Services subcommittee on military personnel, said Congress wanted a
diverse panel in hopes that its recommendations wouldn't be
dismissed as partisan.
</P>
<P>
   The preliminary report said the recommendation was ``based on
our conclusion that in general the ways in which the (military)
services are currently conducting their training, including gender
formats, sustain mission readiness.''
</P>
<P>
   But during a hearing before Buyer's subcommittee, one commission
member, retired Lt. Gen. William Keyes of the Marines, decided to
change his vote to no. He had originally voted to abstain.
</P>
<P>
   He said separate training is good for both sexes and noted that
separate, basic training only lasts for eight to 12 weeks before
male and female recruits would move onto the next training level
together.
</P>
<P>
   The Marines conduct separate training but integrate men and
women after boot camp.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's report is unlikely to settle the debate on coed
training.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's chairwoman, Washington lawyer Anita K. Blair,
voted to support the status quo in military training operations.
She admitted that ``there is no way to tell whether the benefits of
gender-integration outweigh the costs.''
</P>
<P>
   The report's recommendation differs from a panel appointed by
Defense Secretary William Cohen and headed by former Sen. Nancy
Kassebaum Baker, R-Kan., that studied military training issues.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the Kassebaum Baker panel recommended that the
military train and house its male and female recruits separately.
</P>
<P>
   Those recommendations gave conservative House Republicans enough
ammunition to attempt to mandate separate training and housing of
male and female service members. The proposal was attached to a
Defense Department reauthorization bill last May, but it was
blocked by a bipartisan group of lawmakers in the Senate led by
Sen. Olympia J. Snowe, R-Maine.
</P>
<P>
   At the time Snowe and others argued that Congress should wait
for the congressional commission's report before deciding whether
to require changes in military training.
</P>
<P>
   Snowe said she was pleased with the congressional commission's
preliminary report.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their conclusions reflect the best judgment of the officers
and enlisted ranks who run and participate in gender-integrated
training programs,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   During the commission's year-long review, one member, retired
Lt. Gen. George Christmas of the Marines, said he heard much more
about shortages of military personnel and about military personnel
being deployed for longer time periods overseas than he did about
gender-related issues. He said the military is stretched
``perilously close to its limits.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission's final report is due April 15.

A DILEMMA FOR THE FAIR GWYNETH

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Gwyneth Paltrow must be chewing her nails by now.
</P>
<P>
   What if she doesn't win the best-actress Oscar, !(BEGIN
ITALS)and!(END ITALS) the fashion press trashes her dress?
</P>
<P>
   Hey, it could happen.
</P>
<P>
   So, with three days left until the Academy Awards and Paltrow
still undecided about a dress, what's Hollywood's darling going to
do?
</P>
<P>
   Should she play it safe and continue her fashion affair with
Calvin Klein? After all, he did make her look swell at the Golden
Globes in that gray taffeta skirt with the sweater set.
</P>
<P>
   Or should the fair Gwyneth go for a sweet Elizabethan gown like
the ones she wore in the much-nominated film ``Shakespeare in
Love''? But what if Cate Blanchett wore a similar gown? Would they
look like the Twinkie twins?
</P>
<P>
   Wear an old favorite from her closet? As if!
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps she'll go for shock value, with another see-through
beaded Armani number similar to the dress she wore to the opening
night of ``Shakespeare in Love.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Shannon Fox, a professional trend spotter for the
Atkins California marketing firm, ``Gwyneth Paltrow could be
looking for something that is a surprise. She's always wearing
Calvin Klein and Armani, but she could go for a dark horse _ a
designer nobody's associated with her _ such as Prada or
Valentino.''
</P>
<P>
   But her educated bet is on Klein, and she thinks it will
probably be a renaissance-inspired gown in a pale, translucent
shade of yellow or pink.
</P>
<P>
   Fashion critic Mr. Blackwell also sees Paltrow in pink, or maybe
lilac. ``I like the way she dresses, love the way she walks and
hope she doesn't go for pale gold because she needs a glow,''
commented Blackwell at the recent Oscar Fashion Preview at the
Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in Beverly Hills.
</P>
<P>
   The academy's fashion consultant, Fred Hayman, staged the event
for the fashion press, and when it was over many were still placing
their bets on Calvin Klein as Paltrow's choice. Nevertheless, there
were some striking gowns she might consider, like the way-cool
Betsey Johnson gown in chartreuse and fuchsia with a hot-pink boa,
or the pink bugle-beaded gown by Jacques Azagury with a matching
marabou feather coat by Jeanette Katenberg.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, she could be looking at all those gowns sent to her
and decide to make her own instead.
</P>
<P>
   She wouldn't be the first star to attend the Oscars in a dress
she sewed herself. Celeste Holm did it back in 1948, saying, ``I
worked hard on my dress all week because I had a feeling that I
ought to make some sacrifice if I were to win the award.''
</P>
<P>
   And, in fact, she did _ taking home the best supporting actress
award for ``Gentleman's Agreement.'' Her dress was a blue-gray
bouffant gown with a tight bodice, that would still work in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Although Paltrow's gown hasn't been pinned down, she'll be
wearing jewels from the House of Harry Winston. Spokeswoman Carol
Broadie-Gelles says she'll be wearing their diamonds to the awards,
perhaps in a dainty cascading necklace with the simple stud
earrings she wears in her personal life.
</P>
<P>
   Or, she could surprise us all and wear the ruffly platinum
Elizabethan collar accented with 559 diamonds that designer Nicola
Cerrone has offered to loan her.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's her hair. Up, down, curly or straight?
</P>
<P>
   Oscar hair consultant Frederic Fekkai of Beverly Hills says,
``She'll be more modern, and strong, with some hair pulled up on
top (think of `I Dream of Jeannie'), which should be playful and
uplifting, and good for her posture and bone structure.''
</P>
<P>
   And her purse?
</P>
<P>
   Posh purse designer Kathrine Baumann has designed several
glittery bags for other nominees, but not Paltrow.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe she'll go with a tiny drawstring style, or let her date
(it's dear old Dad) carry her comb and lipstick. That way she could
be free to work the red carpet with a stunning stole.

A DILEMMA FOR THE FAIR GWYNETH

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Gwyneth Paltrow must be chewing her nails by now.
</P>
<P>
   What if she doesn't win the best-actress Oscar, !(BEGIN
ITALS)and!(END ITALS) the fashion press trashes her dress?
</P>
<P>
   Hey, it could happen.
</P>
<P>
   So, with three days left until the Academy Awards and Paltrow
still undecided about a dress, what's Hollywood's darling going to
do?
</P>
<P>
   Should she play it safe and continue her fashion affair with
Calvin Klein? After all, he did make her look swell at the Golden
Globes in that gray taffeta skirt with the sweater set.
</P>
<P>
   Or should the fair Gwyneth go for a sweet Elizabethan gown like
the ones she wore in the much-nominated film ``Shakespeare in
Love''? But what if Cate Blanchett wore a similar gown? Would they
look like the Twinkie twins?
</P>
<P>
   Wear an old favorite from her closet? As if!
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps she'll go for shock value, with another see-through
beaded Armani number similar to the dress she wore to the opening
night of ``Shakespeare in Love.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Shannon Fox, a professional trend spotter for the
Atkins California marketing firm, ``Gwyneth Paltrow could be
looking for something that is a surprise. She's always wearing
Calvin Klein and Armani, but she could go for a dark horse _ a
designer nobody's associated with her _ such as Prada or
Valentino.''
</P>
<P>
   But her educated bet is on Klein, and she thinks it will
probably be a renaissance-inspired gown in a pale, translucent
shade of yellow or pink.
</P>
<P>
   Fashion critic Mr. Blackwell also sees Paltrow in pink, or maybe
lilac. ``I like the way she dresses, love the way she walks and
hope she doesn't go for pale gold because she needs a glow,''
commented Blackwell at the recent Oscar Fashion Preview at the

 &HT;    WORK IS NO FAMILY VACATION
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Balancing work and family is more important to most
American workers than any other employment factor, including job
security, working conditions and relationships with co-workers and
bosses, according to a survey released today (Thursday).
</P>
<P>
   While job satisfaction is high in the current economy - 88
percent are satisfied with their job, 54 percent are ``very''
satisfied - 95 percent of the adults surveyed said they are
concerned that work takes too much time away from their families.
</P>
<P>
   In comparison, 71 percent said they worried about job security
and 88 percent cited working conditions as a concern in the latest
``Working Trends'' survey by the John J. Heldrich Center for
Workforce Development at Rutgers University and the Center for
Survey Research and Analysis at the University of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Although job satisfaction holds steady across income, race and
gender lines, ``these same working Americans are telling us that
there's still something fundamentally wrong with how they work
today, and they see ways it can change,'' said Carl Van Horn, the
Heldrich Center director.
</P>
<P>
   (Note to newspapers: Numbers from next three graphs can be
broken out as employees wish list chart)
</P>
<P>
   At the top of workers' wish list is more flexibility in
schedules. Eighty-seven percent said they would like flexible work
hours or days. Currently, 61 percent (CQ) of employers offer
flexible hours and 48 percent (CQ) have flexible days, according to
the survey.
</P>
<P>
   To help them cope with stress, workers would like more
employer-provided benefits, such as reimbursement for education or
training, which was cited by 69 percent. Some 49 percent cited
on-site child care, while 42 percent picked athletic facilities at
work.
</P>
<P>
   Another high priority for workers would be expanding
opportunities for telecommuting. Eight percent of all workers
telecommute now. Fifty-nine percent said they would if given the
opportunity, even though 45 percent said they believe it would
reduce their chances for career advancement.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the relatively high interest in telecommuting, only 17
percent of U.S. employers currently allow it.
</P>
<P>
   The survey showed that 29 percent of employees with
post-graduate degrees work for employers that permit telecommuting;
24 percent of those with undergraduate degrees do so. Only 11
percent of high school graduates work for employers who offer
telecommuting.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also found 46 percent said they work more than 40
hours a week. And a striking 87 percent reported not getting enough
sleep due to increased work demands.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rules of the new economy have created opportunity as well
as uncertainty,'' said Ken Dautrich (cq), director of the Center
for Research and Survey Analysis. ``Despite widespread job
satisfaction and the lowest unemployment rate in 30 years, anxiety
and stress levels associated with work remain high.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey results are based on telephone interviews of 1,000
adults randomly selected from the contiguous United States from
Feb. 5 through Feb. 22. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 3
percentage points. The ``Working Trends'' survey, conducted
quarterly, does not exclude the self- employed.

CHINESE JOURNAL BOLDLY CRITICIZES GOVERNMENT'S DAM PROJECT

 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ In an unusual critique of government policy, a
mainstream intellectual journal here has published a searing expose
of social problems caused by the construction of the giant Three
Gorges Dam.
</P>
<P>
   The article, by a Chinese scholar using a pseudonym, describes
in vivid detail the obstacles to successfully resettling at least
1.3 million people whose homes and farms are to be inundated as the
reservoir for the dam on the Yangtze River is filled in stages
starting in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   If current trends continue, the article warns, the plight of
these uprooted people ``may become an explosive social problem, and
the dam region will become a hotbed of sustained upheaval for
China.''
</P>
<P>
   While similar concerns were expressed here in the late 1980s,
before the dam's construction was approved, they were silenced in
the 1989 crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators at Tiananmen
Square; some of the opponents to the project were imprisoned. Such
blunt dissection of a major government initiative is almost never
seen in print in China now.
</P>
<P>
   The article's publication is likely to cause speculation about
possible cracks in high-level support for the dam, considered a pet
project of Li Peng, the former prime minister who remains
second-most important person in the Communist Party and also heads
the National People's Congress, China's parliament.
</P>
<P>
   When the dam was formally approved by the congress in 1992 at
Prime Minister Li's urging, a third of the delegates voted against
it or abstained, an unprecedented gesture of opposition by the
usually compliant body.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is no sign that the government intends to abandon
the project to build the world's largest dam, an idea blessed by
Mao Tse-tung himself decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   Today's leaders publicly portray the dam as a triumph of the
national will and describe a resettlement program proceeding on
schedule. Project officials recently reported that more than
160,000 people have already been successfully relocated and that
another half million will be moved by 2003, when the reservoir will
be partially filled.
</P>
<P>
   The reservoir is to be filled to capacity in 2009, forcing more
than half a million additional people to move.
</P>
<P>
   When the project was formally approved in 1992, officials
promised that displaced people would be given a better life on
modern farms or in newly built towns where they would find jobs in
expanding industries.
</P>
<P>
   But the recently published article, which appeared in the
journal Strategy and Management, details the acute scarcity of
arable land in the mountains along the Yangtze where most of these
people are supposed to establish new lives and livelihoods. Initial
efforts to transplant farmers onto the steep, eroding hillsides
have fared poorly, it says, and it quotes some who are slated for
resettlement as saying: ``If you want me to move there, you'll have
to make me do it at gunpoint.''
</P>
<P>
   The region's industries are more often failing than booming, the
article notes, and promised jobs have often evaporated. The article
documents a serious lack of funds to pay for resettlement as well
as widespread corruption and deceptive reporting by local
officials.
</P>
<P>
   The article echoes arguments raised by longtime opponents of the
dam in China and abroad, who argue that the environmental,
archaeological and social costs will outweigh the promised benefits
to navigation, energy supplies and flood control.
</P>
<P>
   But domestic critics have been muted in recent years while the
official press has only hinted at problems amid a flood of praise
for the project _ making it all the more surprising to see such a
detailed critique appear in a journal that is seen by thousands of
officials and scholars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such an article could never be published in newspapers here,
which are strictly controlled by the authorities,'' said Li Rui, a
Communist Party elder and a rare open critic of the Three Gorges
Dam, in an interview. ``But as Chinese now have more freedom to
speak out,'' he added, ``I don't expect any actions against the
journal or the writer.''
</P>
<P>
   The article's author is given as Wei Yi, of Central China Normal
University in the city of Wuhan. That is a pseudonym for a Chinese
sociologist with long experience in the Three Gorges region, said a
person familiar with the research.
</P>
<P>
   Strategy and Management, a bimonthly, includes articles on a
range of domestic and foreign policy issues. About 6,000 copies are
sold or given out, mainly to government officials and scholars.
</P>
<P>
   The journal was long known for a conservative bent, but in the
last year or two, it has become more provocative.
</P>
<P>
   ``Often we publish pieces that are not in keeping with official
views, in order to encourage discussion,'' said Zhang Jian, an
editor at the journal.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is hardly a radical forum. The journal is published by
the Strategy and Management Research Society, a small think tank
with close ties to the government and military, but which claims to
be operating with independent funds. The society's directors
include retired military and economic leaders including Wang
Daohan, an elder statesman regarded as the longtime mentor of
President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
   The journal was printed in mid-February as the Chinese New Year
holiday was winding down, and the critique of the dam project has
not yet been widely noticed in Beijing. Zhang said that he knew of
no official objections to the article up to now.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the Relocation and Development Office of the Three
Gorges Project Construction Committee, in Beijing, said Wednesday
that they only saw the article this week and could not yet comment.
</P>
<P>
   Li Rui, the party elder and critic of the dam project, said he
believed that the project was too far along to cancel.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no second thought or debate on this among the
leaders,'' he said, dismissing speculation that Prime Minister Zhu
Rongji might try to kill the project, which by the latest official
estimate, widely seen as low, will cost $25 billion.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the official New China News Agency quoted officials
overseeing the dam project as saying it faces a $3 billion
shortfall for the current (1998-2003) phase of construction. They
expected to raise most of the needed money through domestic bank
loans and bond and stock issues.
</P>
<P>
   The Yangtze has already been diverted around the dam site near
the city of Yichang and construction is well under way. China is
hoping to gain international financing for a share of the costs.
</P>
<P>
   Li Rui said he and other domestic opponents hoped the government
would at least decide to hold the reservoir to a lower level than
planned. This could reduce the number of uprooted people but would
also cut the economic benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The journal article features a detailed case study of Yunyang
county, near the city of Chongqing, in which 120,000 of an
impoverished population of 1.24 million must be moved.
</P>
<P>
   To fight erosion and flooding, the government has declared that
steep slopes should not be cultivated. But in Yunyang county, the
article notes, nearly half the pre-existing farms are on illegally
steep slopes, and every patch of decent farmland is already in use.
</P>
<P>
   The funds allocated for terracing and other measures to create
sustainable cropland in the hills are less than half the needed
amount, the article says.
</P>
<P>
   With industry in the region faring poorly, so is the search for
new factory jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since 1995, Yunyang county has basically been unable to
relocate any more people into factories,'' the article says.
Instead, many displaced townspeople have been given a ``living
allowance'' of $8.50 a month, which is ``unable to satisfy the
elementary living needs.''
</P>
<P>
   In Yunyang county between 1993 and 1998, the article says, more
than $240,000 of the resettlement funds are known to have been
embezzled or otherwise misused and numerous officials have been
imprisoned or disciplined.
</P>
<P>
   Towns have commonly added fake names to the resettlement list to
get more funds, it says, creating ``a piggy bank from which
power-holders can extract private gain.''
</P>
<P>
   One way to relieve the overcrowding would be to transfer many
displaced people to distant regions. This is a government goal, but
has proved unpopular and made little headway.
</P>
<P>
   ``In China,'' the article says, ``all of the areas with better
natural conditions were filled with people long ago.''

   Can a book club be a book club without muffins?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, according to the growing number of reading groups that meet
not in homes or libraries but online. These groups argue that it is
possible to have a successful, serial book discussion without
face-to-face interaction, neighborhood gossip, or even _ and this
is a tough one for ``offline'' groups to grasp _ edible
enticements.
</P>
<P>
   Take the example of the Virtual Reading Group. VRG operates like
the typical offline group in that books are selected by vote and
then read on a schedule. But its ``meetings'' are held on dedicated
message boards at the Web magazine Salon. There, discussion of a
single book can last for weeks, not for the hour or two a month
typical of face-to-face groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a real-life club, you have one night to say what you have
to say,'' said Ken Craft, one of the founders of VRG (where he is
known as ``Prentice Hall'') and a high school English teacher from
Massachusetts. ``Here, you have 30 days to chew over a book, time
for opinions to evolve and change. It's a different model, one of
particular appeal to those, like myself, who are much better
writers than speakers.''
</P>
<P>
   VRG's discussions are undiluted by the social niceties that
often regulate discourse in living rooms. A recent debate on
Hemingway's ``The Sun Also Rises'' drew more than 400 messages, and
virtual blows were nearly exchanged over questions of racism in the
text. It was even suggested, at one point, that those who favored
Hemingway's tome were ``living a lie.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was merciless,'' Craft sighed.
</P>
<P>
   This is definitely not Oprah's Book Club.
</P>
<P>
   VRG is an example of how the Web has adopted, and in some ways
transformed, the popular book club concept. The obvious differences
in online versus offline communication aside, wired clubs appear
more difficult to start and manage but less social and more
intense, even academic, once they pick up steam.
</P>
<P>
   Because no clock is ticking, participants are free to parse
sentences in perpetuity. There are few concerns about how someone's
personality will fit in the mix; online, for better or worse,
members come and go with little or no commitment.
</P>
<P>
   In cyberspace, book chatter is everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Book talk abounds on AOL and the Web,'' confirms Lisa Mandel,
vice president and publisher of Simon &AMP; Schuster Online, which at
one time hosted online clubs on its site. ``It's been important to
the development of many successful sites such as Salon as well as
the online booksellers.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of book clubs are scouring the Web for reading
suggestions, reviews, author information, and reader guides for
specific books. Donna Paz, publisher of the annual guide ``Reading
Group Choices'' and its companion website, said that 76 percent of
book club members surveyed by her company were online. Publisher
sites and online bookstores teem with information targeted to book
clubs, and independent Web pages by individuals and clubs offer
advice on reading selections and club mechanics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The availability of online information on a book often tips
the scale'' when making a selection, says Tom Smith, a member of a
face-to-face (and fork-to-mouth) club in New Jersey that has dubbed
itself ``Mostly, We Eat.'' At its website,
www.serve.com/tsmith/bookclub, the club rates the books it has
read.
</P>
<P>
   It also is the vehicle the club uses to vote on selections and,
of course, handle meal planning _ as the name of the group
suggests, culinary concerns loom large. A members-only area of the
site contains contact information for all and interactive maps to
lead them to the next meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the other members of the club work for high-tech
companies and are self-styled ``techies,'' yet they have no
interest in meeting online. ``It's much more important for the
couples to get together socially _ and eat. It would fall flat on
its face if we weren't sitting around a table,'' Smith said. ``We
need to keep it offline as a counterpoint to our work, where we
spend so much time on.''
</P>
<P>
   Lois Kohn-Claar is part of a reading club called Tertulia (a
Spanish term for a group of people discussing art or literature)
comprising 10 Manhattan women. The club also has a website,
www.bway.net/loiskc/homepge.htm. Although Ms. Kohn-Claar says
members use the Internet extensively, even starting some
discussions online before a physical meeting, she throws down the
gauntlet, somewhat ironically via an e-mail message: ``We would
never resort to becoming an online book group. I can't quite
understand how those can be very fulfilling.''
</P>
<P>
   Online groups do seem to fill the needs of a variety of readers,
though. Some gravitate to such clubs because of location, mobility,
or scheduling restrictions. ``No matter where you are or what your
situation, you can still talk books, even if it's the middle of the
night'' says Ginny Anderson, a retired Latin professor in Pauline,
S.C., the book club leader at SeniorNet, www.seniornet. org, which
supports nine reading groups in a message-board format.
</P>
<P>
   But many members of online reading groups say they simply prefer
discussing books online. Online clubs are more amorphous and open
to new members, adherents say. ``The image of reading groups is of
mostly a female thing,'' says Craft of Virtual Reading Group, ``so
I had this fear that I would go to one and stumble into a
Tupperware party. For someone like me, who is hesitant to enter
unfamiliar territory, an online club was a good option.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Anderson of Senior Net says her clubs turn what is generally
considered a disadvantage of online communication _ the lack of
facial and other physical cues _ into a plus.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no body language,'' she said, ``and it's quite
marvelous. It becomes a pure meeting of the minds. In real life,
all you need is one person to roll their eyes to shut someone up
for the rest of the night. That doesn't happen here.''
</P>
<P>
   Jill Lasker, a science writer based in Richmond, Va., has been a
``facilitator'' for both online and offline clubs since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``My experience with online groups has been much more rewarding
than that with face-to-face groups,'' she writes in an e-mail.
``People are more inhibited in person. Of course, online you don't
see the joyous expression of someone who has absolutely fallen in
love with a book. But it does get to the point in a good online
group where you swear you can hear the other person giggling.''
</P>
<P>
   Online clubs can also address genres and literary niches that it
may be more difficult to build an offline club around. Such is the
case with the African-American Literature Book Club, www.aalbc.com,
founded a year ago by a Brooklyn-based investment banker, Troy
Johnson.
 &UR;  &LR;   &UR; `` &LR; When I started my club,'' Johnson said, ``so many people
contacted me and said there was no access to these kind of books in
their town and no one to talk to about them. So an online group
really drew in people who were having a hard time finding other
people to discuss African-American works with.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the largest hub of online book-club activity can be
found at AOL's Book Central site (keyword: Cafe Booka), home to
more than 100 reading groups on everything from ancient history to
contemporary women's fiction.
</P>
<P>
   Although some groups are focused on individual authors, more
than 80 percent are genre-based and are run like traditional books
clubs, said Marsha Lipps, a semi-retired nuclear medical
technologist in Arlington Heights, Ill., who is co-manager of the
site.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest problem we face in running an online reading group
is the transient nature of being online,'' she said. ``We fight
against the surf mentality of click, click, click. We're always
wondering if enough people are going to show.''
</P>
<P>
   The well-known independent bookstore WordsWorth Books in
Cambridge, Mass., experimented with a chat-centered club model in
late 1997 and plans to renew its efforts this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the physical world, we couldn't keep up with requests for
starting clubs out of the store _ we simply didn't have the
space,'' says Sanjay Kharbanda, WordsWorth's general manager. ``So
that prompted us to start virtual clubs run off our website. The
discussions were high quality but for some reason the concept
quickly ran out of steam. Now that technology has improved we're
hoping to give it another chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Online clubs typically require active management because there's
no ``muffin'' factor, said Rachel Jaffe, a court reporter in
Washington, D.C., who maintains a website,
www.his.com/allegria/compend.html, devoted to information about
online book clubs. It is this that makes them challenging, said Ms.
Jaffe, whose own attempt at running a club failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Members are coming in with less investment,'' she said. ``You
have to make the discussion enticing and be tenacious.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here is a sampling of sites on the Web with material for book
clubs: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Rachel's Compendium of Online Book Discussions, et al.,
www.his.com/allegria/compend.html: A well-maintained, though
incomplete, listing of online book clubs. Also includes information
on general book discussions online and resources for offline
reading groups.
</P>
<P>
   _ The BookWire Index of Reading Groups,
www.bookwire.com/index/reading-groups. html: An eclectic listing of
online book clubs, though a bit outdated.
</P>
<P>
   _ Reading Group Choices, www.readinggroupchoices.com: A large
collection of reading guides, housed in a searchable database, for
use in book discussions. Also contains useful tips on how to start
_ and successfully manage _ clubs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Salon's Virtual Reading Group, www.salonmagazine.com: Visit
the Table Talk section and click on ``Books.'' You'll find a list
of topics, called ``threads.'' Look for any that begin ``TT Reading
Group'' or ``TT Book Discussion Group.'' In particular, the
discussion labeled ``Is a Virtual Reading Group at Salon
feasible?'' provides an inside view of how the groups evolved. But
beware: This thread already contains more than 2,500 posts and is
growing.
</P>
<P>
   _ AOL's Book Central (keyword: Cafe Booka): Home to more than
100 reading groups covering nearly every conceivable genre,
sub-genre, and sub-sub-genre. You only need three members to start
a new one.
</P>
<P>
   _ SeniorNet, www.seniornet.org: You do not have to be a senior
citizen to participate in one of these nine clubs, which range from
Great Books to Romance.

`SUCH A PRETTY, PRETTY GIRL': LOVE IS LIKE AN UNHEALTHY OBSESSION
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
(nk) 
 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Drayton Lightfoot, the hero-narrator of Winston Groom's new
novel, ``Such a Pretty, Pretty Girl,'' is not Forrest Gump. Nor is
there any reason that he should be. Groom has every right to move
on to other subjects after having written the novel named for his
lovably dimwitted hero, followed by ``Gump &AMP; Company'' and
``Gumpisms: The Wit and Wisdom of Forrest Gump.''
</P>
<P>
   And he ostensibly has moved on in ``Such a Pretty, Pretty
Girl,'' about a successful screenwriter who gets roped by an old
flame, Delia Jamison, into tracking down whoever is writing her
letters threatening to publicize her kinkier lovemaking habits if
she won't comply with his demands.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Johnny, despite being a former newspaper columnist, a
well-reviewed novelist and the winner of an Oscar, certainly has
his Gumpish moments.
</P>
<P>
   When Delia tells him that the blackmailer wants her to send him
secret signals on the nightly television news broadcast she
anchors, Johnny draws the astonishing conclusion that ``whoever was
sending the letters most likely lived in the L.A. TV-viewing
area.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You might have missed your calling,'' responds Rick Olsen, a
detective friend of Delia's husband, without apparent irony.
</P>
<P>
   When Delia informs him that the letters have been postmarked
Boston, New York, Miami, Chicago, Atlanta and Washington, Johnny
concludes that ``this guy sending the letters, he's obviously
shrewd.'' He adds, ``Sounds like he's either got accomplices or
he's a traveling man.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, he warns Delia ``that if you keep off the air every time
he makes one of these demands, he's going to wise up.''
</P>
<P>
   And in still another burst of ratiocination he describes what
happened after Delia insisted on coming to the hotel room he lives
in. ``She got up and walked around the room, one hand on a hip. I
felt something stir inside me. Here was someone I found
passionately attractive, walking around in my own hotel room, so,
so ... Well, obviously this was neither the time nor place.
Besides, Rick most likely had his people `keeping an eye on her.'
It could look sticky.''
</P>
<P>
   As if her being there in the first place would not arouse the
suspicions of those following her.
</P>
<P>
   Groom's hero really isn't meant to appear as Inspector
Clouseau-like as he does in these instances. After all, he and
Delia originally bonded at a New Year's Eve party over a favorable
review of one of his novels that she had read in The New York
Times.
</P>
<P>
   When he accepts an invitation to meet her husband after deciding
to help find her blackmailer, she invites him to go swimming: ``The
water's warm. We always swim here before lunch. It improves your
appetite. Besides, I want to talk to you about T.S. Eliot.''
</P>
<P>
   Filling us in on their past, Johnny describes a trip to Bermuda
they once took. After cooking her rock lobsters, ``we stayed up and
talked for a while. Delia wanted to discuss literature, mostly
mid-20th-century women writers of whom she had become fond.'' He
adds that the next day she turned out to have ``a half-finished
Edith Wharton novel in her purse,'' perhaps to show that she was
fond of early-20th-century women writers as well.
</P>
<P>
   Back in California it strikes him as paradoxical that on a sunny
morning he ``was feeling, to steal a line from Melville, `cloaked
in a damp, drizzly, foggy November of the soul.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all this pasted-on sophistication, Johnny finally
strikes you as stupid at the deepest level. This is because he
can't seem to get Delia out of his system, despite what he
describes as ``an unbreachable span developing between us.'' (As if
one could reduce a distance by breaking through it.)
</P>
<P>
   Johnny finds Delia absolutely fascinating, and he tries to sell
her to the reader as such by describing her as beautiful,
mysterious, passionately carnal and, above all, honest to a fault.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Delia's honesty turns out to be the engine of the
novel. It eventually explains the trouble she has gotten herself
into. The book's ironic epigraph is ``Honesty is the best policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet this reader did not find Delia attractive in the least.
Beautiful she may be, ``with incredibly long legs,'' ``dark green
eyes, almost like jade, and long auburn hair.'' But where Johnny
tries to paint her as mysterious, she comes across as infuriatingly
evasive. Where he offers her up as sexy, she seems little more than
a practiced tease. As for her vaunted honesty, she may have a gift
for blunt speech, but she could not be more dishonest in her
conduct, sending Johnny on a mission to explore her past, yet
withholding essential information lest he find out what he needs to
know.
</P>
<P>
   In his devotion to Delia, Johnny truly resembles Forrest Gump.
But where Forrest's loyalty to the neurotic Jenny is a redemptive
side of his dimwittedness, Johnny's obsession with Delia seems
nothing but stupid. Clearly Groom continues to be compelled by the
figure of the beautiful woman without mercy. But whatever more of
interest he has to say on the subject, this novel doesn't express
it. The prettiness of the ``pretty, pretty girl'' is barely even
skin deep.

AMWEST-STRIKE (Washington) - It is an emotionally charged standoff
between entrenched opponents _ flight attendants vs. America West _
with both sides fighting for the upper hand in the last hours of
negotiations before Friday night's strike deadline. By PETER
CORBETT. Story will move in the ``F'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
TOWNLAK-ECOLOGY (Tempe, Ariz.) - While Tempe city officials and
development boosters cheer the progress of Town Lake,
environmentalists are quietly bemoaning threats from the Rio Salado
Project. Mosquitoes, disease, birds in the flight paths of Sky
Harbor International Airport _ all could result from the creation
of a 1 billion gallon artificial lake, which Tempe officials plan
to fill this summer. The latest threat: exotic species of turtles
from the Phoenix Zoo, which are being removed from the zoo's
popular lagoon to prevent them from migrating into Town Lake. By
STEVE YOZWIAK. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
ROCKET KID (Phoenix) - Thirteen-year-old David Silverstein is
suspended by the Deer Valley School District for the remainder of
the term by a hearing officer. A search of his locker two weeks ago
turned up a device that was deemed a ``firearm'' under district
guidelines. Even Homer Hickam of ``October Sky'' fame gets into the
act, telling the district to ``lighten up.'' By JIM GINTONIO. Story
will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
BOOKS-NEW (Undated) _ Capsule reviews of new and notable books. By
ANNE STEPHENSON, Special to the Republic. Story moved in the ``E''

 &QL; 
 &QL; 
NOTARO-COLUMN (Phoenix) - ``So, are you ready to get married?'' I
asked my best friend Jeff as he, my other best friend Jamie and I
sat down to eat lunch at a sidewalk cafe in Pasadena last Saturday.
I had flown to California for the three of us to have somewhat of a
last hurrah, since he was the final one of us to tie the knot and
would be a married man by the month's end. Jeff looked puzzled.
``I'm ready,'' he snapped as he spread a napkin over his lap. ``I
bought an extra pillow.'' By LAURI NOTARO. Story will move in the

THE SCOOP ON THE OSCARS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BARBARA DE WITT  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Talk, talk and more talk. No matter where you are
this month _ whether it's the beauty parlor, the grocery store
checkout line, or a black-tie dinner, folks are yakking about
Sunday's Academy Awards. There's the buzz about who's going (will
Monica Lewinsky really show up?), what they'll be wearing (Armani
is a front-runner), who the presenters are (the motion picture
academy isn't telling) and yadda, yadda, yadda.
</P>
<P>
   Looking for some fresh Oscar topics? We collected a few juicy
tidbits to share before the big night.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
WHOOPI GETS A BIG MACK(IE) ATTACK!
</P>
<P>
   glitz-and-glamour king bob mackie was cornered at a recent
fund-raiser at the Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel, and he confirmed
that he and his partner, Ray Aghayan, will be dressing Whoopi
Goldberg in a number of glam gowns for her mistress of ceremonies
gig at the Academy Awards. We also heard she'll be wearing Harry
Winston jewels.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
OSCAR'S IN THE BAG
</P>
<P>
   That tres trendy purse designer Kathrine Baumann of Beverly
Hills held a press conference earlier this week to unveil her
latest one-of-a-kind designs that will be carried to the Academy
Awards. The tiny Austrian crystal-covered minaudieres (that's
French for tiny jeweled evening bag) include a grand piano style
for Celine Dion; a crown-shaped bag for ``Elizabeth'' star Cate
Blanchett; a military purple heart design to be carried by Steven
Spielberg's wife, Kate Capshaw; and a similar design made of real
gold bullion (valued at $150,000) for Rita Wilson in honor of
husband Tom Hanks' role in ``Saving Private Ryan.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
SEX SIRENS GO SHOPPING
</P>
<P>
   Melanie Griffith and Sharon Stone are busy with their Oscar gown
shopping, and we heard they're considering Elizabeth Galindo, a
couture designer from Sacramento. At least they've got appointments
to see her latest designs.
</P>
<P>
   While Galindo may not be a household name (yet), her celebrity
client list already includes Demi Moore and Sophia Loren.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
POLITICIANS GO HOLLYWOOD
</P>
<P>
   California's first lady Sharon Davis and Gov. Gray Davis are
going to the Oscars. And _ surprise, surprise _ she's already
chosen which gown she'll wear. It's a dropped-waist gown in black
and pewter taffeta by her favorite designer, Pol Atteu of Beverly
Hills.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
HOTEL HANKY-PANKY
</P>
<P>
   The chi-chi (Mobil gave them five stars) Peninsula hotel in
Beverly Hills is already completely booked for Oscar night with
umpteen nominees and presenters, but they won't say which ones. We
also heard the hotel has arranged to ``buy'' the parking spaces up
and down the nearby streets that night to accommodate all the limos
that will be lining up to whisk the stars to the awards.
</P>
<P>
   But wait, there's more. According to the hotel publicist, Oscar
nominees are treated to jet-lag massages, personally monogrammed
pillow cases and Frette robes. And there's even a seamstress named
Lulu on hand to sew on missing bugle beads or let out seams that
shrank over night.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
COSTUMERS COME OUT OF THE CLOSET
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Every year there's an Oscar for best costumes, and this year
you can be the judge. Authentic costumes from each Academy Award
nominee are on display now through April 16 at the Fashion
Institute of Design and Merchandising, 919 S. Grand Ave., Los
Angeles. It's free, and the hours are 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Monday
through Saturday. For more information, call (323) 624-1200.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
FAMOUS DESIGNERS TELL ALL
</P>
<P>
   Halston designer Kevan Hall predicts we'll see a sportier look
on young Hollywood stars that will include billowy taffeta skirts
with cashmere tops, but there will still be plenty of beaded gowns.
The cost of a typical Oscar-worthy gown, he says, is $1,500 to
$4,000, depending on the amount of crystal beading.
</P>
<P>
   Although Hall hasn't dished any dirt on the stars he dresses,
Pamela Dennis has admitted she made a fashion faux pas on Kate
Winslet's Golden Globes gown. According to a story in this week's
TV Guide, Dennis said she should have made the dress with a black
lining instead of the less-flattering nude shade. She also revealed
who returns the dresses she loans, and she says Jamie Lee Curtis
returned her last gown with flowers and a note.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
HAIR DRESSER CUTS AND TELLS
</P>
<P>
   Frederic Fekkai, the official hair dresser for the Oscars,
predicts stars and starlets are going for shiny, straight hair like
Gwyneth Paltrow's 'do, and several will be coloring their hair
blond or red. Men, he says, are going for a short,
clean-but-slightly rumpled look. And they may be sporting Clark
Gable moustaches instead of goatees.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
PRESS GETS POLISHED
</P>
<P>
   There's so much hype with the Oscars that even the fashion press
is expected to dress up. Although designers aren't offering gowns,
several beauty experts, including Frederic Fekkai and Bobbi Brown,
have sent invitations to fashion editors for complimentary hair and
makeup applications just before the awards ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   TALK TO ME, HARRY
</P>
<P>
   Carol Broadie-Gelles of Harry Winston was in town for the annual
pre-Oscar fashion forecast earlier this month and she predicted
we'll be seeing a lot of stars with diamond tiaras or hairpins
instead of those tacky banana clips or cutesy daisies. It's a
glittery but understated look, she explained, and those who don't
put diamonds in their hair will most likely wear diamond necklaces
that rest on the collarbone and a pair of huge emerald-cut diamond
stud earrings. Like the designer gowns, these jewels are loaned for
one night only.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
SURGEON SHOOTS STARS
</P>
<P>

Sharon Stone, Lauren Bacall and Janet Leigh, will be auctioned by
Christie's at a gala charity affair in New York tonight. Fashion

A BAN ON BOW TIES
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Come Oscar night, the fashion police may be citing
Tinseltown's leading men for breaking the black-tie rule. For
years, the term ``black tie'' has meant a tuxedo with a black bow
tie, but according to Patty Fox, the official stylist for the
Academy Awards, we'll be seeing long ties with tuxedos.
</P>
<P>
   At the pre-Oscar fashion preview for the press, Fox confided,
``The long tie with a tuxedo is a more sleek, modern look than a
bow tie. And, yes, you could say it's more L.A., especially with a
black shirt.''

to choose which face they'll wear. Like other fab fashions on loan,
they'll need to give it back.

TEXAS LAWMAKERS COMPLAIN OF DELAYED FARM AID 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GARY MARTIN  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Texas lawmakers criticized the Clinton
administration Wednesday for its delays in distributing $2 billion
in disaster assistance to offset crop and livestock losses last
year from a stubborn drought.
</P>
<P>
   A heavy demand for assistance nationwide has caused delays,
according to Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman, who has pledged to
release funds as ``expeditiously and as fairly as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton declared all 254 Texas counties disaster areas
last year because of drought conditions in the Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   But Texas farmers and ranchers who suffered losses are still
waiting for federal disaster assistance as this year's planting
season nears an end.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Texas farmers the money will be too late to provide any
assistance with spring planting,'' said Rep. Henry Bonilla,
R-Texas, a member of the House Appropriations subcommittee on
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   Many Texas counties are enduring drought conditions again this
year. Last week, Gov. George W. Bush sought federal assistance for
167 counties due to the lack of rainfall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year we were hit with a tremendous drought, which ended
with a substantial flood. Now we are back in a drought situation,''
said William Mitchell, the judge of Uvalde County west of San
Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have declared Uvalde County a disaster area; we have filed
our applications,'' Mitchell said. ``We feel we have done what we
can do locally to trigger something from Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   Sens. Phil Gramm and Kay Bailey Hutchison, both Texas
Republicans, told Glickman Wednesday of their ``deepening concern''
about the delay in disaster relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``These delays are building to a crisis,'' they wrote in a
letter to the secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Glickman told lawmakers earlier this month that the Department
of Agriculture has extended the application deadlines for disaster
assistance until April 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``Due to the heavy demand from farmers, USDA is taking longer
than we anticipated to implement (the program) fully,'' Glickman
said.
</P>
<P>
   He also said USDA has provided other forms of assistance to
farmers and ranchers who suffered losses due to weather in 1998 and
previous years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has really reached the point of being ridiculous,''
Bonilla said. ``Farmers and ranchers have not fully recovered from
last year's devastating drought, and we are facing more of the same
this year in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is bureaucracy at its worst,'' Bonilla said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Larry Combest, chairman of the House Agriculture Committee,
has called Glickman to appear before his panel later this month to
answer questions about delays in the disaster assistance program.

THE SCOOP ON THE OSCARS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Talk, talk and more talk. No matter where you are
this month _ whether it's the beauty parlor, the grocery store
checkout line, or a black-tie dinner, folks are yakking about
Sunday's Academy Awards. There's the buzz about who's going (will
Monica Lewinsky really show up?), what they'll be wearing (Armani
is a front-runner), who the presenters are (the motion picture
academy isn't telling) and yadda, yadda, yadda.
</P>
<P>
   Looking for some fresh Oscar topics? We collected a few juicy
tidbits to share before the big night.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
WHOOPI GETS A BIG MACK(IE) ATTACK!
</P>
<P>
   glitz-and-glamour king bob mackie was cornered at a recent
fund-raiser at the Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel, and he confirmed
that he and his partner, Ray Aghayan, will be dressing Whoopi
Goldberg in a number of glam gowns for her mistress of ceremonies
gig at the Academy Awards. We also heard she'll be wearing Harry
Winston jewels.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
OSCAR'S IN THE BAG
</P>
<P>
   That tres trendy purse designer Kathrine Baumann of Beverly
Hills held a press conference earlier this week to unveil her
latest one-of-a-kind designs that will be carried to the Academy
Awards. The tiny Austrian crystal-covered minaudieres (that's
French for tiny jeweled evening bag) include a grand piano style
for Celine Dion; a crown-shaped bag for ``Elizabeth'' star Cate
Blanchett; a military purple heart design to be carried by Steven
Spielberg's wife, Kate Capshaw; and a similar design made of real
gold bullion (valued at $150,000) for Rita Wilson in honor of
husband Tom Hanks' role in ``Saving Private Ryan.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
SEX SIRENS GO SHOPPING
</P>
<P>
   Melanie Griffith and Sharon Stone are busy with their Oscar gown
shopping, and we heard they're considering Elizabeth Galindo, a
couture designer from Sacramento. At least they've got appointments
to see her latest designs.
</P>
<P>
   While Galindo may not be a household name (yet), her celebrity
client list already includes Demi Moore and Sophia Loren.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
POLITICIANS GO HOLLYWOOD
</P>
<P>
   California's first lady Sharon Davis and Gov. Gray Davis are
going to the Oscars. And _ surprise, surprise _ she's already
chosen which gown she'll wear. It's a dropped-waist gown in black
and pewter taffeta by her favorite designer, Pol Atteu of Beverly
Hills.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
HOTEL HANKY-PANKY
</P>
<P>
   The chi-chi (Mobil gave them five stars) Peninsula hotel in
Beverly Hills is already completely booked for Oscar night with
umpteen nominees and presenters, but they won't say which ones. We
also heard the hotel has arranged to ``buy'' the parking spaces up
and down the nearby streets that night to accommodate all the limos
that will be lining up to whisk the stars to the awards.
</P>
<P>
   But wait, there's more. According to the hotel publicist, Oscar
nominees are treated to jet-lag massages, personally monogrammed
pillow cases and Frette robes. And there's even a seamstress named
Lulu on hand to sew on missing bugle beads or let out seams that
shrank over night.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
COSTUMERS COME OUT OF THE CLOSET
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Every year there's an Oscar for best costumes, and this year
you can be the judge. Authentic costumes from each Academy Award
nominee are on display now through April 16 at the Fashion
Institute of Design and Merchandising, 919 S. Grand Ave., Los
Angeles. It's free, and the hours are 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Monday
through Saturday. For more information, call (323) 624-1200.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
FAMOUS DESIGNERS TELL ALL
</P>
<P>
   Halston designer Kevan Hall predicts we'll see a sportier look
on young Hollywood stars that will include billowy taffeta skirts
with cashmere tops, but there will still be plenty of beaded gowns.
The cost of a typical Oscar-worthy gown, he says, is $1,500 to
$4,000, depending on the amount of crystal beading.
</P>
<P>
   Although Hall hasn't dished any dirt on the stars he dresses,
Pamela Dennis has admitted she made a fashion faux pas on Kate
Winslet's Golden Globes gown. According to a story in this week's
TV Guide, Dennis said she should have made the dress with a black
lining instead of the less-flattering nude shade. She also revealed
who returns the dresses she loans, and she says Jamie Lee Curtis
returned her last gown with flowers and a note.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
HAIR DRESSER CUTS AND TELLS
</P>
<P>
   Frederic Fekkai, the official hair dresser for the Oscars,
predicts stars and starlets are going for shiny, straight hair like
Gwyneth Paltrow's 'do, and several will be coloring their hair
blond or red. Men, he says, are going for a short,
clean-but-slightly rumpled look. And they may be sporting Clark
Gable moustaches instead of goatees.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
PRESS GETS POLISHED
</P>
<P>
   There's so much hype with the Oscars that even the fashion press
is expected to dress up. Although designers aren't offering gowns,
several beauty experts, including Frederic Fekkai and Bobbi Brown,
have sent invitations to fashion editors for complimentary hair and
makeup applications just before the awards ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   TALK TO ME, HARRY
</P>
<P>
   Carol Broadie-Gelles of Harry Winston was in town for the annual
pre-Oscar fashion forecast earlier this month and she predicted
we'll be seeing a lot of stars with diamond tiaras or hairpins
instead of those tacky banana clips or cutesy daisies. It's a
glittery but understated look, she explained, and those who don't
put diamonds in their hair will most likely wear diamond necklaces
that rest on the collarbone and a pair of huge emerald-cut diamond
stud earrings. Like the designer gowns, these jewels are loaned for
one night only.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
SURGEON SHOOTS STARS
</P>
<P>
   Talk about pressure. It's no longer enough that you get a new
'do for the Oscars. Now you're supposed to get a quickie pre-Oscar
touch-up at the plastic surgeon's office. Honest! Dr. Frank Ryan
says he has so many celebrity patients requesting quickie peels and
collagen injections that he's staying open until midnight on

A DILEMMA FOR THE FAIR GWYNETH

(NOTE USE OF ITALICS IN 2ND GRAF)

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Gwyneth Paltrow must be chewing her nails by now.
</P>
<P>
   What if she doesn't win the best-actress Oscar, (BEGIN
ITALS)and(END ITALS) the fashion press trashes her dress?
</P>
<P>
   Hey, it could happen.
</P>
<P>
   So, with three days left until the Academy Awards and Paltrow
still undecided about a dress, what's Hollywood's darling going to
do?
</P>
<P>
   Should she play it safe and continue her fashion affair with
Calvin Klein? After all, he did make her look swell at the Golden
Globes in that gray taffeta skirt with the sweater set.
</P>
<P>
   Or should the fair Gwyneth go for a sweet Elizabethan gown like
the ones she wore in the much-nominated film ``Shakespeare in
Love''? But what if Cate Blanchett wore a similar gown? Would they
look like the Twinkie twins?
</P>
<P>
   Wear an old favorite from her closet? As if!
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps she'll go for shock value, with another see-through
beaded Armani number similar to the dress she wore to the opening
night of ``Shakespeare in Love.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Shannon Fox, a professional trend spotter for the
Atkins California marketing firm, ``Gwyneth Paltrow could be
looking for something that is a surprise. She's always wearing
Calvin Klein and Armani, but she could go for a dark horse _ a
designer nobody's associated with her _ such as Prada or
Valentino.''
</P>
<P>
   But her educated bet is on Klein, and she thinks it will
probably be a renaissance-inspired gown in a pale, translucent
shade of yellow or pink.
</P>
<P>
   Fashion critic Mr. Blackwell also sees Paltrow in pink, or maybe
lilac. ``I like the way she dresses, love the way she walks and
hope she doesn't go for pale gold because she needs a glow,''
commented Blackwell at the recent Oscar Fashion Preview at the
Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in Beverly Hills.
</P>
<P>
   The academy's fashion consultant, Fred Hayman, staged the event
for the fashion press, and when it was over many were still placing
their bets on Calvin Klein as Paltrow's choice. Nevertheless, there
were some striking gowns she might consider, like the way-cool
Betsey Johnson gown in chartreuse and fuchsia with a hot-pink boa,
or the pink bugle-beaded gown by Jacques Azagury with a matching
marabou feather coat by Jeanette Katenberg.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, she could be looking at all those gowns sent to her
and decide to make her own instead.
</P>
<P>
   She wouldn't be the first star to attend the Oscars in a dress
she sewed herself. Celeste Holm did it back in 1948, saying, ``I
worked hard on my dress all week because I had a feeling that I
ought to make some sacrifice if I were to win the award.''
</P>
<P>
   And, in fact, she did _ taking home the best supporting actress
award for ``Gentleman's Agreement.'' Her dress was a blue-gray
bouffant gown with a tight bodice, that would still work in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Although Paltrow's gown hasn't been pinned down, she'll be
wearing jewels from the House of Harry Winston. Spokeswoman Carol
Broadie-Gelles says she'll be wearing their diamonds to the awards,
perhaps in a dainty cascading necklace with the simple stud
earrings she wears in her personal life.
</P>
<P>
   Or, she could surprise us all and wear the ruffly platinum
Elizabethan collar accented with 559 diamonds that designer Nicola
Cerrone has offered to loan her.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's her hair. Up, down, curly or straight?
</P>
<P>
   Oscar hair consultant Frederic Fekkai of Beverly Hills says,
``She'll be more modern, and strong, with some hair pulled up on
top (think of `I Dream of Jeannie'), which should be playful and
uplifting, and good for her posture and bone structure.''
</P>
<P>
   And her purse?
</P>
<P>
   Posh purse designer Kathrine Baumann has designed several
glittery bags for other nominees, but not Paltrow.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe she'll go with a tiny drawstring style, or let her date
(it's dear old Dad) carry her comb and lipstick. That way she could
be free to work the red carpet with a stunning stole.

nausea in AIDS and cancer patients and ``should be tested
rigorously'' in scientific studies, a prestigious medical panel
advising the federal government said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the most comprehensive assessments of the medical uses
of the drug, an 11-member panel of investigators for the Institute
of Medicine warned against permitting smoked marijuana for such
patients _ as some advocacy groups are seeking _ and instead
proposed development of an inhaling device.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marijuana has potential as medicine, but it is undermined by
the fact that patients must inhale harmful smoke,'' said Dr.
Stanley J. Watson Jr., one of the study's principal investigators,
at a news conference called to release the inch-thick study.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until researchers develop a safe and effective delivery
system, care-givers must consider the health problems that can
result from smoking when deciding whether to recommend marijuana to
patients,'' said Watson, co-director of the University of
Michigan's Mental Health Research Institute in Ann Arbor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marijuana's future as medicine does not involve smoking,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   The institute said that for people undergoing chemotherapy and
those suffering from AIDS, chemicals in marijuana stimulate the
appetite, ease pain and anxiety and reduce nausea and vomiting.
</P>
<P>
   But the panel said marijuana, which has been touted by some
advocacy groups as a treatment for glaucoma, reduces eye pressure
accompanying the disease only temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   The study proposed development of new drugs derived from the
chemicals in marijuana called ``cannabinoids'' that could be
delivered through an inhaler. The Food and Drug Administration has
approved only one such medication, Marinol, currently available in
pill form, for use by seriously ill AIDS patients or those with
cancer undergoing chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   The report said smoked marijuana should be permitted only in a
few circumstances until additional marijuana-derived drugs and the
inhaler are available.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John A. Benson Jr., dean of the Oregon Health Sciences
University School of Medicine and the other principal investigator
for the study, said marijuana should be smoked only by ``terminally
ill patients or those with debilitating symptoms that do not
respond to approved medications.'' Benson called for strict medical
supervision in such instances.
</P>
<P>
   The White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, which
commissioned the study, called the findings ``the most thorough
analysis to date of the relevant scientific literature'' on the
medical use of marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   But the office, headed by retired Army Gen. Barry McCaffrey, who
has opposed legalizing marijuana for medical use, did not endorse
the findings.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, McCaffrey said he ``will carefully study'' the
recommendations, adding, ``We note in the report's conclusion that
the future of cannabinoid drugs lies not in smoked marijuana, but
in chemically defined drugs,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Patient advocacy groups hailed the study. Chuck Thomas,
co-director of the Marijuana Policy Project here, said the report
``shows that marijuana is a relatively safe and effective medicine
for many patients.''
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Turner, an executive with the gay rights group ACT-UP,
said, ``This report is a long time coming. Once and for all, we now
have the stamp of approval for what we've been maintaining all
along, that marijuana has medical benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., who led a successful fight to
get the House to condemn medical marijuana last fall, said he is
``deeply concerned'' that the report might encourage people to
smoke marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that some of the chemicals in marijuana can be
useful but said their place is in inhalers or pills. ``We should
not sanction smoked marijuana because there is no way to control
that,'' McCollum said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Maginnis of the conservative Family Research Council
insisted doctors have other medicines to treat any ailment that
marijuana can help.
</P>
<P>
   In its study, the Institute of Medicine, which is affiliated
with the independent, quasi-federal National Academy of Sciences,
shot down a long-held view of many opponents of marijuana that it
is a ``gateway'' drug to more dangerous narcotics.
</P>
<P>
   The report says there is ``no conclusive evidence that the drug
effects of marijuana are causally linked to subsequent abuse of
other illicit drugs.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Public opinion on using marijuana for medical purposes has been
divided.
</P>
<P>
   Ballot initiatives supporting such use were approved by voters
in California in 1996 and voters in Alaska, Arizona, Nevada, Oregon
and Washington last year.
</P>
<P>
   But the Clinton administration has denounced the measures and
said federal law prohibits medical use of the drug except in a few
cases. Last year's House resolution said marijuana is a dangerous
and addictive drug and should not be legalized for medical use.

<P>
   PHOENIX - ``So, are you ready to get married?'' I asked my best
friend Jeff as he, my other best friend Jamie and I sat down to eat
lunch at a sidewalk cafe in Pasadena last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   I had flown to California for the three of us to have somewhat
of a last hurrah, since he was the final one of us to tie the knot
and would be a married man by the month's end.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff looked puzzled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm (begin ital) ready (end ital),'' he snapped as he spread a
napkin over his lap. ``I bought an extra pillow.''
</P>
<P>
   Jamie and I looked at each other and burst out laughing. She,
having been married for a year, and I, being married for three,
could tell that our little friend had some very lofty ideas about
sharing one's life with someone as if you were the only one that
mattered, just like a man.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kristin's the nice partner,'' Jeff explained about his
betrothed. ``I'm the bossy one. She understands that. We have that
understanding.''
</P>
<P>
   ``None of us are the nice partner in our relationships,'' Jamie
added. ``All three of us are the mean one. But that doesn't matter.
Things still change.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Like, you might as well get rid of all of your CDs now,
because in two weeks, she'll think that they all suck,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And you should carry roughly $5 in quarters with you at all
times so you can call her from wherever you are,'' Jamie added.
</P>
<P>
   ``And instead of falling asleep to music, it will be white
noise,'' I quipped. ``Women need that. I have a fan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a wave machine. Happy hour will be a thing of the past.
There's something you do instead now,'' Jamie said. ``It's called
dinner at home.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And after you come home from work or after 5 o'clock,'' I
stated, ``you need to ask if you want to go back out again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless she sends you to the store,'' Jamie said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless she sends you to the store,'' I confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forget about being the first one to get the mail anymore,''
Jamie said. ``You'll never get unhandled mail again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And if you find jelly or ice cream on the remote control,'' I
insisted, ``it's a totally natural thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``After you get married, you'll never be as funny at home as you
are at work,'' Jamie added.
</P>
<P>
   ``And when she laughed at your jokes before, she was faking
it,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you've told a story, you need to retire it,'' Jamie
announced. ``Because every time she hears a story more than once,
she'll hate you a little more and a little more.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And never read to her from a book or magazine article aloud,''
I declared. ``She'll never think it's as interesting as you do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If she gets sick,'' Jamie said, ``you have to hold her hair
and clean it up and then kiss her afterward.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But other than that instance, if you're initiating the kiss,
you need to brush your teeth first,'' I added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her sexual obligation to you expires in two years,'' Jamie
stated. ``And should she decide to oblige you after that, you
should be very, very grateful.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And you're never allowed to say `boink,' `pork,' `do it' or
`get it on,' '' I informed Jeff. ``Or wake her up in the middle of
the night when you're . . . overwhelmed by your . . . man desire.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You could get suspended for that,'' Jamie whispered.
</P>
<P>
   ``If she's not talking to you, like when she's reading a book or
watching TV, that means she's BUSY,'' I nodded. ``And (begin ital)
you (end ital) need to be quiet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And when you feel the need to go to the bathroom, you should
ask her if she needs to go first,'' Jamie said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you should really try to make it a point to do doody
someplace else before you get home,'' I declared.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if you do it at home by accident,'' Jamie said carefully,
``never, never call her in to look at it. It's gross and will
entirely change her perspective of you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She'll see you as the animal that you are,'' I stated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The animal that you are,'' Jamie agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if there's some potato chips or cookies in a bag, don't
eat them,'' I said. ``She might not be done with them and may want
them at some point. Just because there's food in the house doesn't
mean it's fair game.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And if she asks you if you want to share a dessert at a
restaurant, that means she wants some,'' Jamie added. ``And it's in
your best interest to say yes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And when you're at your parents' house and she yawns for the
first time, it means it's time to go,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the phone rings and you don't think it's for you,'' Jamie
added, ``you still have to answer it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If she ever comes home and there's a drunk guy on the couch
and another one throwing up in the bathroom, expect to be in
trouble,'' I informed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``If she buys a bar of soap that isn't white, it is not for
you,'' Jamie stated.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if she asks you to do several things, it's not OK to just
do the last thing she said because that's the only one you
remember,'' I asserted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Be honest with yourself. Set the alarm for the time the Real
You will get up, not the Ambitious You, because the Ambitious You
doesn't really exist,'' Jamie added.
</P>
<P>
   ``At night, if she takes the covers, just get used to being
cold,'' I stated. ``It's more important for her to be warm. A
simple draft can render her infertile, and then your family name
will die with you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And that's selfish,'' Jamie added.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's selfish,'' I agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff stared at us for a long, long time, trying to take it all
in. As I studied his face, I got the impression as he furrowed his
brow and crinkled his mouth that he was about to cry.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, I panicked. Had we said too much? Had we been too
honest? Had we scared him horribly? Was he thinking about jumping
ship? I looked at Jamie, and realized that she was looking at me
with the same awful look on her face that I had on mine.
</P>
<P>
   What had we done? We are the mean ones, after all!
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe you're right,'' he finally said. ``Maybe I'm not so
ready. How could I be so stupid? What am I thinking! Am I OUT OF MY
MIND?!''
</P>
<P>
   Jamie and I didn't know what to say. We just sat there,
horrified, our mouths hanging open, getting ready to protest. WHAT
HAD WE DONE?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any extra pillowcases!'' Jeff proclaimed as he
stomped his foot and then looked at us, smiling wickedly. &QL;

   NEWHALL-LAND (Santa Clarita, Calif.) _ Show us the money. That
was the message from some Newhall Land and Farming shareholders to
Thomas Lee, director of the company's board, at Wednesday's annual

under analysts' estimates of its value _ took center stage at the
meeting despite the company's record $304 million in revenues and
$1.89 net earnings per unit in 1998. By Jason Takenouchi.

 &HT;    SAMARANCH WEATHERS CONFIDENCE VOTE, REMAINS VAGUE ON FUTURE WITH
IOC

<TEXT>
<P>
   Lausanne, Switzerland Twice on Wednesday the International
Olympic Committee exploded into applause to show support for Juan
Antonio Samaranch, whom they have come to call simply ``the
leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Samaranch demanded an official vote of confidence
to record in black and white what was obvious to all in the massive
closed chamber of the Palais Beaulieu: Samaranch will preside over
the IOC as long as he wishes.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, 86 of the 90 voting members returned ballots
expressing support for the 78-year-old Spaniard, whose head has
been demanded by media and critics around the world for his failure
to prevent the worst scandal in the history of the Modern Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Only two members opposed him. There was one blank ballot and
another not returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is happy,'' said executive board member Jacques Rogge of
Belgium. ``What gives him so much strength is that he won so
overwhelmingly.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of Samaranch's support comes from patronage: He handpicked
about 80 percent of the members. Additionally, he is genuinely
respected for his contributions to the Games, which were on the
verge of bankruptcy when he assumed control in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   So complete was the support for Samaranch that even one of the
six members expelled Wednesday had nothing but praise. Asked by
reporters about his feelings toward Samaranch, Agustin Arroyo, the
former member from Ecuador, launched into a lengthy review of
Samaranch's accomplishments after 18 years as the IOC's president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't forget what Samaranch has done for the last 18 years,''
Arroyo said. ``He has spread the Olympic movement out to the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, there are signs that Samaranch may not serve out his term,
which expires in 2001. Most of his strong public support from key
IOC members such as vice president Dick Pound have centered on the
notion that only Samaranch could lead the IOC through the tempest
caused by the Salt Lake City bidding crisis.
</P>
<P>
   And Wednesday, with the expulsion of the six members and the
firming up of plans to study and enact reforms by the end of the
year, it seemed that a course had been charted that would allow for
Samaranch's departure.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch's own address to the IOC seemed to presage a goodbye.
``I have personally given the best of myself to the Olympic
movement over the last 18 years,'' he said. ``My last service to
Olympism would be to restructure our organization in order to enter
the new millennium even stronger than before.''
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch has told close friends lately that he fears a plot
within the IOC administration to force him from office. For the
most part, top officials shrug in amazement that he would get such
ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is a persistent rumor that Samaranch may retire
before the end of the year. A special session has been called for
December, when the IOC is expected to address the reform issues
head on.
</P>
<P>
   There are equally persistent rumors that he will wait until the
close of the Sydney Games, which are generally regarded as having
the potential of being so well done that no one will remember much
about the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The big question surrounds a successor, however. Three members
of the executive board --Rogge, Dick Pound of Canada and Pal
Schmitt of Hungary -- are often mentioned as successors. Kim
Un-Yong of South Korea was considered a contender until he was
implicated in the Salt Lake scandal and received a harsh warning.
Another name that often is mentioned is Jean-Claude Killy, the
former Olympic skier who became an IOC member in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch was coy about his plans in a brief interview with
reporters Wednesday morning before the vote. ``My idea is to remain
until 2001,'' Samaranch told reporters. ``But we will see.''

<P>
   LAUSANNE, Switzerland _ The International Olympic Committee on
Wednesday took steps to move beyond the humiliation of the Salt
Lake City bidding scandal, but it may take some time to tell if the
committee can stay ahead of its legion of critics.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC expelled six members accused of accepting cash, favors
and other gifts during Salt Lake's successful campaign for the 2002
Winter Olympics. The case that involved more than $1 million in
improper inducements has now claimed 10 IOC members. Four others
have resigned.
</P>
<P>
   The committee also promised to begin reform efforts immediately
with the creation of an ethics board to guard against further
corruption plus a special commission to recommend changes to the
bidding process by host cities and the way the 105-year-old
organization conducts its business.
</P>
<P>
   However, the IOC stopped short of satisfying those critics who
have called for the ouster of president Juan Antonio Samaranch. The
membership overwhelmingly granted him a vote of confidence.
</P>
<P>
   After the wrenching exercise of expelling their colleagues, some
IOC members were clearly relieved. Anita DeFrantz, the senior U.S.
member, managed a smile as she waited for an elevator in the lobby
of the Lausanne Palace hotel. ``But this is only the first step,''
she said. ``We have a lot of work to do, but it must start with the
first step.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacques Rogge, an IOC member from Belgium who was on the special
commission that investigated the Salt Lake allegations, expressed
similar sentiments. ``This was the first turning point, but we have
to continue with reform. We must show we mean business.''
</P>
<P>
   At least one key critic was unimpressed. In a statement released
Wednesday, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., expressed disappointment.
``Expelling members does nothing to address the utter lack of
transparency and accountability in IOC processes,'' McCain said.
``What we must see are concrete reforms. These reforms must
eliminate completely and forever a culture based on gifts and
lavish travel that has brought a dark cloud over the integrity of
the entire Olympic movement.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Commerce Committee member, Sen. Ted Stevens, has drawn
up legislation that would strip the IOC of tax-exempt status.
Congressional hearings into the Salt Lake scandal are scheduled for
next month.
</P>
<P>
   Reaction among corporate sponsors, which could lose the
privilege of writing off their sponsorships, ranged from positive
to guardedly optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically from the onset, we have been telling the IOC to go
deep and go wide in their investigations, and it appears they are
now doing that,'' said John LaBella, a spokesman for Eastman Kodak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is the beginning of change,'' said Susan
Rosenberg, spokeswoman for United Parcel Service. ``It is a step in
the right direction. It is a demonstration that the IOC membership
is intent on making change, but just how far and how wide remains
to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will reserve judgement on whether we think the change has
gone far enough until we see the full outcome of the meeting (that
concludes today),'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference after the expulsions, Dick Pound, the IOC
member who chaired the commission that investigated the
allegations, said the committee was at the ``end of the
beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're starting to deliver on what we said at the beginning of
the crisis,'' said Pound, also an IOC vice president. ``It is good
to have this difficult part of our work completed so we can go
forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Pound said the IOC intends to reform the host city bidding
process, enact ethical reforms and begin to make basic changes in
the committee's openness and accountability by the end of the year,
which is an Olympic year that will culminate in the 2000 Sydney
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a fair amount of work ahead of us to recover, regroup
and move on,'' Pound said.
</P>
<P>
   At least one of the expelled members seemed to accept the idea
that he was sacrificed for the IOC. Agustin Arroyo, who had been
the IOC member from Ecuador since 1968, said it was his misfortune
to be selected for slaughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The press, they wanted to have heads knocked off,'' Arroyo
told a surging mass of reporters and photographers. ``Mine happened
to be in the way.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Arroyo, the IOC expelled Zein El Abdin Ahmed
Abdel Gadir of the Sudan, Jean-Claude Ganga of the Republic of
Congo, Lamine Keita of Mali, Sergio Santander of Chile and Paul
Wallwork of Samoa. They are believed to be the first IOC members
ejected for corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Ganga, the most prominent IOC member expelled, said he would
accept the IOC decision, but he complained that the investigation
was done hastily and incompletely.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're also thinking at this moment of the African sportsmen;
who will have to realize that our fight faces a new test,'' Ganga
said. ``We have known others, such as racial discrimination,
poverty and indifference. This what we face day to day. Starting
from today this will be the case for injustice and exclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Ganga, who organized the boycott by African countries of the
1976 Montreal Games, has said in recent days that his case was
politically motivated and that the IOC was targeting its African
members. Three of the six expelled members are Africans.
</P>
<P>
   He refused to elaborate.

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO &UR;  &LR; _ The 60 men were slumped in their chairs, weary
with the weight of the ex-hooker's insults.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hated you!'' she said, hurling her words so that the men in
the back row with their heads in their hands would take notice.
They did, snapping to attention as though they had been pinched.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to stick a knife in you!'' the woman shouted, jolting
an old man so hard that he knocked his glasses off his face.
</P>
<P>
   It was not even lunch time and the men had already endured a
prosecutor's hourlong lecture on the law, close-up color slides
showing the affects of venereal disease, and three other angry
ex-prostitutes. In the afternoon there would be more lectures _
from police officers, business owners and residents of
prostitution-plagued neighborhoods. And for this daylong
humiliation in a drafty room in San Francisco's Hall of Justice,
the men paid $500 and considered themselves lucky: Their first
arrest for soliciting sex would be wiped from their records, never
to haunt them again.
</P>
<P>
   Unless they get caught a second time.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to San Francisco's answer to the world's oldest problem.
Modeled after those daylong traffic schools for bad drivers, the
First Offender Prostitution Program _ or ``john school,'' as people
here call it _ is tackling the sex trade by trying to drum some
sense into those who perpetuate it. The police say the program, the
first of its kind, is working like a charm: of the 2,181 men who
have taken the class since it began four years ago, only 18 have
been re-arrested.The program's success has created such a buzz all
over the country that several cities have fashioned similar
programs for themselves and others are considering it.
</P>
<P>
   No one contends that the program will put a stop to all
prostitution; Massage parlors, escort services, strip clubs and
other fronts for the sex trade persist here. But together with an
aggressive outreach program that helps prostitutes find an
alternative to street life and relentless police undercover
operations that arrest the men who buy sex, the first offender
program, the police say, has led to a dramatic, visible drop in San
Francisco's outdoor sex trade. Indeed, for a city of nearly 800,000
people, the level of street prostitution here is relatively small,
reduced to two spots, and lately, mostly one.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you'd seen this before, it was like a sex bazaar,'' said
Tom Buckley, a police lieutenant in the city's Northern Station, as
he led an operation the other night in a neighborhood called Polk
Gulch with four police decoy prostitutes (three women and a man)
and four teams of three arresting officers. Cars with single men
kept circling around one block where an officer stood shivering in
a halter top and spandex tights. In four hours on a slow night, the
team arrested 43 men, and virtually every one of them opted for the
john school over prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Results like these have given the first offender program its
considerable attention. Several cities, including Fresno, Las
Vegas, Toronto and Nashville, Tenn., now have similar programs.
Last fall the program won a $100,000 Innovations in American
Government award from the Ford Foundation, the John F. Kennedy
School of Government at Harvard and the Council for Excellence in
Government. That has led to an avalanche of requests to visit from
law-enforcement officials throughout the country. Last month alone,
45 officials from seven cities _ Portland, Ore., Seattle,
Pittsburgh, Washington, Jacksonville, Fla., Springfield, Mo., and
St. Paul, Minn. _ came here for a look.
</P>
<P>
   To Norma Hotaling, a former prostitute who co-founded the
program in 1995 with a police lieutenant and an assistant
prosecutor, the most exciting part of this war on street sex is the
SAGE Project Inc., a nonprofit service organization she runs that
helps prostitutes and other women. Since it began as a small
outreach group in 1992, she said, the organization, which receives
some of its money from the first offender program, has helped 500
young women get off the streets. Fifteen of those work full time at
the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no other city doing what we're doing,'' Ms. Hotaling
said. ``Everyone just arrests the women and throws them in jail.
But we're getting them off the streets, getting them vocational
training, saving hundreds of thousands of dollars a year on the
medical care the city spends on these women.''
</P>
<P>
   Organizations advocating the legalization of prostitution,
including Coyote and the Sex Workers Alliance of Vancouver, have
criticized Ms. Hotaling and the john school for emphasizing the
victimization of street prostitutes at the hands of pimps and
customers. But a recent study of 130 local prostitutes, Ms.
Hotaling said, found that 68 percent had been raped _ almost half
at least five times _ and that 82 percent had been assaulted.
</P>
<P>
   And the stories told by former prostitutes at the john school,
reminiscent of the inmates who tell prison horror stories to youths
in ``scared straight'' programs, have a palpable impact on the men
in the class.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent class the men _ of all ages and races _ were clearly
mortified by the women's stories, squirming in their seats and
often looking down at the floor as they were lectured.
</P>
<P>
   Angel, a dark-haired woman in her early 30s who started working
the streets when she was 14, told the men she lied when clients
would ask her if she was a heroin addict. ``I'd have needle tracks
all up and down my arms and say no,'' she said. She would have
unprotected sex, she said, even though she had had several venereal
diseases. She fantasized about maiming the men.
</P>
<P>
   Several men shuddered.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hotaling's story was a surprise. At 47, her street days nine
years behind her, she looks like a suburban mom, dressed in
coordinating jacket and slacks, her blond hair efficiently short.
After showing the grisly slides of what venereal disease does to
sexual organs _ at least to those men who did not turn away from
the screen _ she quietly announced that she knew all about
prostitution firsthand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a prostitute for 20 years, and a heroin addict,'' Ms.
Hotaling said. ``I planned on sticking a knife in a john, any john,
and thank God for you and men that I got out before that
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The men also heard stories about the customers who did not get
away _ men who were robbed and stabbed by prostitutes. At the end
of the day they walked out of class looking spent.
</P>
<P>
   Few would meet a reporter's eye as they left, but one student
did agree to give his assessment of the class, anonymously.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was harmless,'' the man, a 40-year-old computer
technician, said of his soliciting an undercover police officer for
oral sex. ``I know I'm harmless. But I think when they talked about
the diseases they had, that really made me sick. That and the
slides. I don't want to risk getting caught again either.''
</P>
<P>
   Next time he felt a certain urge, he said, his face reddening,
he would rent a movie.

   LAUSANNE, Switzerland _ The International Olympic Committee on
Wednesday took steps to move beyond the humiliation of the Salt
Lake City bidding scandal, but it may take some time to tell if the
committee can stay ahead of its legion of critics.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC expelled six members accused of accepting cash, favors
and other gifts during Salt Lake's successful campaign for the 2002
Winter Olympics. The case that involved more than $1 million in
improper inducements has now claimed 10 IOC members. Four others
have resigned.
</P>
<P>
   The committee also promised to begin reform efforts immediately
with the creation of an ethics board to guard against further
corruption plus a special commission to recommend changes to the
bidding process by host cities and the way the 105-year-old
organization conducts its business.
</P>
<P>
   However, the IOC stopped short of satisfying those critics who
have called for the ouster of president Juan Antonio Samaranch. The
membership overwhelmingly granted him a vote of confidence.
</P>
<P>
   After the wrenching exercise of expelling their colleagues, some
IOC members were clearly relieved. Anita DeFrantz, the senior U.S.
member, managed a smile as she waited for an elevator in the lobby
of the Lausanne Palace hotel. ``But this is only the first step,''
she said. ``We have a lot of work to do, but it must start with the
first step.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacques Rogge, an IOC member from Belgium who was on the special
commission that investigated the Salt Lake allegations, expressed
similar sentiments. ``This was the first turning point, but we have
to continue with reform. We must show we mean business.''
</P>
<P>
   At least one key critic was unimpressed. In a statement released
Wednesday, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., expressed disappointment.
``Expelling members does nothing to address the utter lack of
transparency and accountability in IOC processes,'' McCain said.
``What we must see are concrete reforms. These reforms must
eliminate completely and forever a culture based on gifts and
lavish travel that has brought a dark cloud over the integrity of
the entire Olympic movement.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Commerce Committee member, Sen. Ted Stevens, has drawn
up legislation that would strip the IOC of tax-exempt status.
Congressional hearings into the Salt Lake scandal are scheduled for
next month.
</P>
<P>
   Reaction among corporate sponsors, which could lose the
privilege of writing off their sponsorships, ranged from positive
to guardedly optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically from the onset, we have been telling the IOC to go
deep and go wide in their investigations, and it appears they are
now doing that,'' said John LaBella, a spokesman for Eastman Kodak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is the beginning of change,'' said Susan
Rosenberg, spokeswoman for United Parcel Service. ``It is a step in
the right direction. It is a demonstration that the IOC membership
is intent on making change, but just how far and how wide remains
to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will reserve judgement on whether we think the change has
gone far enough until we see the full outcome of the meeting (that
concludes today),'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference after the expulsions, Dick Pound, the IOC
member who chaired the commission that investigated the
allegations, said the committee was at the ``end of the
beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're starting to deliver on what we said at the beginning of
the crisis,'' said Pound, also an IOC vice president. ``It is good
to have this difficult part of our work completed so we can go
forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Pound said the IOC intends to reform the host city bidding
process, enact ethical reforms and begin to make basic changes in
the committee's openness and accountability by the end of the year,
which is an Olympic year that will culminate in the 2000 Sydney
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a fair amount of work ahead of us to recover, regroup
and move on,'' Pound said.
</P>
<P>
   At least one of the expelled members seemed to accept the idea
that he was sacrificed for the IOC. Agustin Arroyo, who had been
the IOC member from Ecuador since 1968, said it was his misfortune
to be selected for slaughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The press, they wanted to have heads knocked off,'' Arroyo
told a surging mass of reporters and photographers. ``Mine happened
to be in the way.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Arroyo, the IOC expelled Zein El Abdin Ahmed
Abdel Gadir of the Sudan, Jean-Claude Ganga of the Republic of
Congo, Lamine Keita of Mali, Sergio Santander of Chile and Paul
Wallwork of Samoa. They are believed to be the first IOC members
ejected for corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Ganga, the most prominent IOC member expelled, said he would
accept the IOC decision, but he complained that the investigation
was done hastily and incompletely.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're also thinking at this moment of the African sportsmen;
who will have to realize that our fight faces a new test,'' Ganga
said. ``We have known others, such as racial discrimination,
poverty and indifference. This what we face day to day. Starting
from today this will be the case for injustice and exclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Ganga, who organized the boycott by African countries of the
1976 Montreal Games, has said in recent days that his case was
politically motivated and that the IOC was targeting its African
members. Three of the six expelled members are Africans.
</P>
<P>
   He refused to elaborate.

<P>
   Lausanne, Switzerland Twice on Wednesday the International
Olympic Committee exploded into applause to show support for Juan
Antonio Samaranch, whom they have come to call simply ``the
leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Samaranch demanded an official vote of confidence
to record in black and white what was obvious to all in the massive
closed chamber of the Palais Beaulieu: Samaranch will preside over
the IOC as long as he wishes.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, 86 of the 90 voting members returned ballots
expressing support for the 78-year-old Spaniard, whose head has
been demanded by media and critics around the world for his failure
to prevent the worst scandal in the history of the Modern Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Only two members opposed him. There was one blank ballot and
another not returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is happy,'' said executive board member Jacques Rogge of
Belgium. ``What gives him so much strength is that he won so
overwhelmingly.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of Samaranch's support comes from patronage: He handpicked
about 80 percent of the members. Additionally, he is genuinely
respected for his contributions to the Games, which were on the
verge of bankruptcy when he assumed control in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   So complete was the support for Samaranch that even one of the
six members expelled Wednesday had nothing but praise. Asked by
reporters about his feelings toward Samaranch, Agustin Arroyo, the
former member from Ecuador, launched into a lengthy review of
Samaranch's accomplishments after 18 years as the IOC's president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't forget what Samaranch has done for the last 18 years,''
Arroyo said. ``He has spread the Olympic movement out to the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, there are signs that Samaranch may not serve out his term,
which expires in 2001. Most of his strong public support from key
IOC members such as vice president Dick Pound have centered on the
notion that only Samaranch could lead the IOC through the tempest
caused by the Salt Lake City bidding crisis.
</P>
<P>
   And Wednesday, with the expulsion of the six members and the
firming up of plans to study and enact reforms by the end of the
year, it seemed that a course had been charted that would allow for
Samaranch's departure.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch's own address to the IOC seemed to presage a goodbye.
``I have personally given the best of myself to the Olympic
movement over the last 18 years,'' he said. ``My last service to
Olympism would be to restructure our organization in order to enter
the new millennium even stronger than before.''
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch has told close friends lately that he fears a plot
within the IOC administration to force him from office. For the
most part, top officials shrug in amazement that he would get such
ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is a persistent rumor that Samaranch may retire
before the end of the year. A special session has been called for
December, when the IOC is expected to address the reform issues
head on.
</P>
<P>
   There are equally persistent rumors that he will wait until the
close of the Sydney Games, which are generally regarded as having
the potential of being so well done that no one will remember much
about the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The big question surrounds a successor, however. Three members
of the executive board --Rogge, Dick Pound of Canada and Pal
Schmitt of Hungary -- are often mentioned as successors. Kim
Un-Yong of South Korea was considered a contender until he was
implicated in the Salt Lake scandal and received a harsh warning.
Another name that often is mentioned is Jean-Claude Killy, the
former Olympic skier who became an IOC member in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch was coy about his plans in a brief interview with
reporters Wednesday morning before the vote. ``My idea is to remain
until 2001,'' Samaranch told reporters. ``But we will see.''

<P>
   Only two years ago, a report that two-thirds of America's
leading universities had dropped the Shakespeare requirement for
English majors in favor of courses on popular culture and gender
studies prompted worries that the playwright _ regarded by many
left-wing ideologues as the quintessential Dead White Male _ was
becoming a has-been, a victim of the commissars of political
correctness and willfully watered-down curriculums.
</P>
<P>
   Today, happily, it's clear that such reports of Shakespeare's
demise were vastly exaggerated. Shakespeare is still the most
produced playwright in 1990s America, and in England he was
recently voted in one BBC poll ``the Briton of the Millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   There are replicas of the Globe Theater in London and Tokyo, and
in Germany his birthday prompts an annual celebration. As the
scholar Jonathan Bate (``The Genius of Shakespeare'') points out,
the Bard has become ``a world genius'' with a ``cross-cultural
appeal'' that defies both the debunking of academic radicals and
the stuffy canonization of traditionalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shakespeare in Love'' _ a witty new movie that works an
improvisation on the playwright's life _ was nominated for 13
Academy Awards and shares a nomination for Best Picture with
``Elizabeth,'' another film (and one with seven nominations) set
against the backdrop of Elizabethan England.
</P>
<P>
   These pictures are only the tip of the Shakespeare iceberg.
Coming soon are a slew of movies based on his plays, including
Julie Taymor's version of ``Titus Andronicus'' (with Anthony
Hopkins, Alan Cumming and Jessica Lange) and a film adaptation of
``A Midsummer Night's Dream,'' starring Calista Flockhart, Michelle
Pfeiffer and Kevin Kline. Alicia Silverstone will soon star in
Kenneth Branagh's new musical adaptation of ``Love's Labour's
Lost,'' while Ethan Hawke will tackle a ``Hamlet'' set in the
corporate world of the 90s.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the fact that Shakespeare is a brand name, one who
neither demands royalties nor contests rewrites, has something to
do with his current revival. Yet at the same time, there is a
latent power to his work that has allowed successive generations of
directors, critics and actors to continually reinvent him in their
own image and to find new ways (some profound, some forced, some
obviously silly) of pointing up his relevance.
</P>
<P>
   Restoration critics emphasized his role as a dramatic playwright
who addressed public and political issues. Romantics portrayed him,
romantically, as the poet of melancholy and love. And modernists
have stressed the difficulty of his work, its layered,
contradictory meanings.
</P>
<P>
   How fitting that in our own age of adolescence (and box-office
demographics driven by teen-age tastes), filmmakers are busy
depicting him as the poet of youth and youthful confusion. Baz
Luhrmann started this wave in 1996 with his hip, music-video-like
adaptation of ``Romeo and Juliet,'' starring Leonardo DiCaprio and
Claire Danes.
</P>
<P>
   Now there is a ridiculously dumbed-down high school version of
``The Taming of the Shrew'' on the way (``10 Things I Hate About
You''), as well as a ``Macbeth'' set on the high school football
gridiron and an ``Othello'' set in the world of college basketball.
``Shakespeare in Love'' depicts the playwright himself as a
lovelorn youth suffering from writer's block, while ``Elizabeth''
portrays his sovereign as a young woman struggling to grow into her
role as Queen.
</P>
<P>
   Just what is it about Shakespeare's work that accounts for his
enduring ability to engage the popular imagination, his
accessibility to so many eras and cultures? The usual reasons
offered for his greatness _ the richness of his language, the range
and depth of his characterizations, the fecundity of his
imagination _ do not explain why he, rather than, say, Dante or
Chaucer has become and remained a household name. Nor do paeans to
his storytelling gifts _ after all, he lifted most of his plots
from pre-existing works.
</P>
<P>
   In his controversial book, ``Reinventing Shakespeare,'' Gary
Taylor, an editor of an Oxford University Press edition of the
playwright's works, suggested that the Bard owed much of his
success to happy accidents of history.
</P>
<P>
   ``If France had won its wars against England, if England like
other countries had been culturally transformed by the upheavals of
the late 18th century,'' he wrote, ``then Shakespeare would almost
certainly not have achieved or retained the dominance he now
enjoys.'' Shakespeare's current international reputation, in
Taylor's view, was at least in part ``the fruit not of his genius
but of the virility of British imperialism, which propagated the
English language on every continent.''
</P>
<P>
   There is something to the argument that the ``myriad-minded
Shakespeare,'' as Coleridge called him, has gradually been
institutionalized, and that in becoming part of the
English-language canon _ taught in schools, cited in dictionaries,
studied by scholars and laymen alike _ he has insidiously become
our familiar.
</P>
<P>
   We daily use phrases popularized by Shakespeare like ``brave new
world,'' ``the primrose path'' and ``sound and fury,'' and even
those of us who have never seen a play associate Romeo and Juliet
with doomed love and Hamlet with existential indecision.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   When we see a screwball comedy on the big screen, we are seeing
updated variations on ``A Midsummer Night's Dream.'' And when we
are made privy to the thoughts of characters on ``Ally McBeal,'' we
are being given a jump-cut, MTV version of the old Shakespearean
soliloquy. As Jane Austen once remarked of Shakespeare: ``one gets
acquainted'' with him ``without knowing how.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, his influence on other writers has been so pervasive
that he has become part of the very literary air we breathe.
Dostoyevsky, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Freud, Baudelaire, Ibsen,
Strindberg, Pirandello _ to name just a few of the authors and
thinkers indelibly shaped by Shakespeare is to rattle off a litany
of the makers of modern Western culture. Nineteenth-century
nihilism and 20th-century psychology, French existentialism and
Emersonian self-reliance _ all could be said to have seeds in
Shakespeare's art.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that such crucial writers and philosophers responded so
ardently to Shakespeare, however, suggests that there was something
in the playwright's work itself that was in tune with the modern
Zeitgeist. The very style and structure of his work _ mixing and
remaking genres, fusing highbrow art and popular entertainment,
breaking the fourth wall of the stage _ prefigure our
post-modernist outlook, just as his work's ambiguity and pursuit of
plural truths resonate, as Jonathan Bate argues, with our age of
relativity.
</P>
<P>
   The game-playing of Shakespeare's characters, their gender
confusion, their romantic and familial disputes, their efforts to
grapple with the contingency of reason and love, all seem
peculiarly modern. Such spirited, independent heroines as Beatrice
and Rosalind appear to have more in common with today's feminists
than the circumscribed women of Elizabethan England, while his
questioning heroes like Hamlet, so skilled in irony and self-
dramatization, reflect the preoccupation with the self manifested
by both the Reformation and contemporary America.
</P>
<P>
   In his best seller, ``Shakespeare: The Invention of the Human,''
the scholar Harold Bloom argues that the playwright was the first
writer to give us portraits of human beings capable of change and
growth. He brought psychology to the fore, Bloom suggests, while
laying out an unsentimental, even nihilistic vision of a world of
loss and flux.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The latter observation echoes the pioneering work of the Polish
critic Jan Kott, whose famous 1964 book ``Shakespeare Our
Contemporary'' illuminated the modernity of the Bard. Kott not only
demonstrated how Shakespeare's tragedies and histories anticipated
the violence and cruelty of 20th-century history _ and more
particularly Eastern Europe's suffering at the hands of Hitler and
Stalin _ but he also underscored the affinities between Shakespeare
and such avatars of the Theater of the Absurd as Beckett, Ionesco
and Genet.
</P>
<P>
   In plays like ``Hamlet'' and ``King Lear,'' Kott discerned a
dark, uncompromising and very modern view of the world as an
irrational place, ruled by violence and chance, a place in which
``it is the clowns who tell the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Renaissance is often described as the era that saw
the beginnings of modern science and the flowering of the arts,
Kott sees its later stages as an age of disillusion and
contradictions, an age in which it became clear that ``the great
dreams of the humanists about a happy era had not been fulfilled.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed the Elizabethan era was marked not only by economic
expansion and the unification of Britain, but by the unsettling
effects of progress. Thanks to the printing press, literacy was
spreading, and traditional divisions between the classes were
dissolving.
</P>
<P>
   Explorers were opening up the world, and astronomers were on the
verge of discoveries that would shatter people's sense of cosmic
order. A new global market was offering enterprising merchants the
promise of vast riches. And the growing secularization of the arts
had exacerbated worries that the world was becoming a godless and
dangerous place.
</P>
<P>
   The waning years of Elizabeth's reign and the ascension of James
I to the throne after her death in 1603 seem to have exacerbated a
sense of uncertainty for Shakespeare. Despite his professional
success, his plays took a darker turn with ``Troilus and
Cressida,'' ``Measure for Measure'' and the great tragedies,
``Othello,'' ``King Lear,'' ``Macbeth'' and ``Antony and
Cleopatra.''
</P>
<P>
   Although James was an affable, politically astute king, he was
also regarded as an uncouth and undisciplined man, and the public
image of his court would suffer from a series of sexual scandals.
In the view of some critics, plays like ``Coriolanus'' and ``Timon
of Athens,'' both dating from 1607-8, reflected the decline in
values and factionalization of the aristocracy that lay beneath the
domestic peace of James' reign.
</P>
<P>
   Bridging the medieval and the modern, the age of Shakespeare was
a time, as Joseph Papp and Elizabeth Kirkland observed in their
1988 book, ``Shakespeare Alive!,'' when ``nothing seemed stable or
reliable anymore; the old ways were disappearing fast, and the
search for a fixed point of moral reference was a futile one _
everything depended on your point of view, for as Hamlet says,
`there is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so.'''
</P>
<P>
   It was an age, in Kott's words, when people were forced to
grapple with ``the divergence between the greatness of the human
mind'' and ``the frailty of the moral order,'' an age of melancholy
and Machiavellianism, an age marked by a taste for violent
entertainment and anxiety about the accelerating pace of social and
cultural change. In short, an age oddly in sync with our own.

   DEATHROW-HEARING (Los Angeles) _ When convicted cop killer
Kenneth Earl Gay strolled into court, a carefree bounce in his step
loudly rattled the chains clasped around both his ankles. The smile
on the lanky killer's face disturbed Sandra Jackson, the widow of
the hero LAPD officer murdered by Gay in 1983, as she sat in the

<P>
   Plaster walls frequently develop a network of hairline cracks
that are too narrow to be filled with patching plaster, yet they
cannot be covered with paint. The best way to restore the wall
surface is by skim-coating it. Skim- coating is the technique of
applying thin layers of gypsum-based joint compound over the entire
surface. The layers are so thin that even after applying several
coats, the total thickness of all the layers together is less than
an eighth of an inch. Skim-coating can also be used to smooth a
textured surface.
</P>
<P>
   Skim-coating does not require any arcane skills. It is a matter
of troweling on the coating, then spreading it thin with a wide,
drywall taping knife. The job, however, is time-consuming; it will
take three four days to skim-coat the walls of an average-sized
room. It is also rather tedious.
</P>
<P>
   Skim-coating can rescue a wall with numerous hairline cracks but
cannot help a wall if the plaster is loose or unsound. Test the
condition of the wall first by pushing against it with your
fingertips. If the surface gives under slight pressure, it may mean
that the plaster has broken loose from the lath keys behind. In
this case it is only a matter of time before the plaster cracks and
drops off in chunks. The remedy here is not a light surface
coating, but replacing the loose sections with drywall.
</P>
<P>
   If the walls are firm with perhaps an occasional crack or hole,
then you can skim-coat them. You will need to collect your tools
and materials first. Skim-coating is done with drywall compound: a
white, pastelike substance that is applied to drywall to cover
joints, cracks and nailheads. For the first coating, use
setting-type compound. It is available in 18- or 20-pound bags in
powdered form and must be mixed with water. Consult the package
specifications for information on coverage and also to see if the
compound can be sanded after it dries _ some compounds set
rock-hard and cannot be sanded.
</P>
<P>
   The package will also give you an indication of working time _
how long it takes for the compound to dry. Usually this is
indicated by a number that follows the brand name. Thus a brand
like Stay-Smooth 45 will set in about 45 minutes. Unless you are a
fast and skilled worker, it is best to choose a compound with a
90-minute setting time.
</P>
<P>
   It is important to use setting-type compound for the first layer
or base coat, because it dries by chemical action that will not
affect any paint that is on the wall. Air-drying mixtures, like
ready-mix joint compound, can weaken a paint bond causing the paint
and skim-coating to fall away eventually. Once the base coat is on
the wall, however, you can use ready-mix joint compound for the
second and third layers.
</P>
<P>
   You will need only a few simple tools to skim-coat. A
6-inch-wide and 10- inch-wide taping knife will be sufficient,
unless you need to work in a few narrow areas, then you may need a
knife with a 3-inch blade. A useful, but not necessary, tool is a
hawk (see illustration). You use it to hold the compound as you
work around the room. You will also need a large five-gallon
plastic bucket to mix the setting-type compound.
</P>
<P>
   Start by making sure the wall surfaces are clean and free of
grease and dust. Remove any crumbling plaster. You can use the
setting-type compound to fill large cracks and holes but first
paint any bare, unpainted areas of plaster with shellac. The
shellac will seal the plaster and keep it from absorbing water from
the compound.
</P>
<P>
   Mix the setting-type compound according to the package
directions. Use a broomstick or a garden trowel to stir the water
and powder together until it attains a consistency of soft ice
cream. If the mixture is too thin, it will run down the wall.
Compound that is too thick will be difficult to spread.
</P>
<P>
   Start in the corner of the room at the top and work down toward
the center. Then move to the bottom and work up. Use long, smooth
strokes and overlap each pass. Using this technique, gradually work
your way across the wall. Pause occasionally to wash off the knife.
The base layer should be relatively free of bumps and ridges, but
it doesn't have to be perfectly smooth.
</P>
<P>
   Allow the base coat to dry _ this may take several hours _ then
apply the second coat. Use the 10-inch knife to smooth the compound
into a thin, even layer. If the second layer is smooth, two layers
may be sufficient; if not, add a third after the second layer is
dry. The final step is to sand the entire surface, then prime and
paint it.

HAMPARTZOUM BERBERIAN, 93; PROLIFIC SYMPHONIC COMPOSER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TOM LONG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hampartzoum Berberian, a prolific composer whose work showed
both Western and Eastern musical influences, died of cancer
Saturday in the Armenian Nursing Home in Boston. He was 93.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Berberian, of Watertown, Mass., was the composer of many
vocal, choral and operatic works as well as symphonic and chamber
pieces. His works includes the choral work ``Lincoln at
Gettysburg,'' which was inspired by the Gettysburg address, and
``Requiem Aeternam,'' which was written to commemorate the the
massacre of some 1.5 million Armenians by the Ottoman Turks from
1915 to 1920.
</P>
<P>
   The Masterworks Chorale and Orchestra, performed ``Requiem
Aeternam'' at Cary Memorial Hall in Lexington in December 1980. It
is an ambitious piece for orchestra, chorus and vocal sextet drawn
from a long poem by Yeghishe Charentz
</P>
<P>
   ``Of its sincerity, and of the directness with which that
sincerity was communicated, there was never any doubt,'' Richard
Buell wrote in a review published in the Globe on Dec. 8, 1980.
``The work's strongest qualities came across cumulatively, rather
than through any particularly felicitous local detail. . . . The
work's large spiritedness certainly came through, particularly in
the big choruses that might have harkened distantly to Prokofiev's
`Alexander Nevsky.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Because it was sung in Armenian, Buell admitted that he could
say nothing of the chorus's enuniciation, though, ``there was a
full in-tune, hearty sound to everything they undertook.''
</P>
<P>
   The composer, Buell wrote, ``looked quite pleased to be
receiving the acclaim that came his way at the end of the
evening.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Berberian was born in Adana, Turkey. He became a US citizen
in 1968. His musical engagements took him to many countries in
Latin America, Europe and the Middle East. He was a founder of the
Teketan Cultural Association.
</P>
<P>
   He leaves three sons, Hratch of South Dakota, Vahe of
Pennsylvania and Shahe ``Charlie'' of Somerville, Mass.; a
daughter, Nayiri of Watertown; and four grandchildren.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Infirmities of various kinds have made Luciano
Pavarotti's appearances at the Metropolitan Opera fairly rare over
the last couple of years, but he did turn up for his
30th-anniversary gala early this season _ the performance is to be
broadcast by PBS on March 31 _ and soon after it, the Met announced
that he would sing three performances as Cavaradossi in the
company's production of ``Tosca.''
</P>
<P>
   The first was on Tuesday evening, when Carol Vaness also joined
the cast in the title role, and James Morris took over the role of
Scarpia. The new cast is to sing the Saturday afternoon
performance, which is one of the Met's international radio
broadcasts, and again next Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   There is a lesson to be learned about the clash of evil and
virtue in ``Tosca,'' but a cynical one, because although Scarpia is
dead and his regime is crumbling, evil still crushes Cavaradossi
and Tosca in the end. The lesson a listener took away on Tuesday
was more mundane, perhaps, but noteworthy nevertheless. Mainly, it
was that one should not underestimate Pavarotti's power to
re-create himself.
</P>
<P>
   The indications had suggested otherwise in recent years: His
voice was sounding tattered, his acting, never very supple, had
become increasingly stiff, and he often seemed wholly uninterested
in what he was doing. Yet here he was, 50 pounds lighter and
looking comparatively trim, and having undergone hip and knee
replacement surgery that made him considerably more agile than he
has seemed in years. Instead of slowly lowering himself to the
ground after the firing squad execution, as has been his manner in
recent performances, he did a somewhat more realistic fall and
roll, with help from a pile of sandbags. And vocally, he sounded
fresh, powerful and engaged in the role.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say that this was the ``Tosca'' of one's dreams,
if anyone dreams of ``Tosca.'' Nello Santi conducted a thoughtful
performance that flowed at a leisurely pace, and although that made
for some lovely effects, there were moments when both Pavarotti and
Ms. Vaness often seemed intent on pushing him forward, and tended
to anticipate the beat.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Vaness was fighting other problems, including a wobble on
sustained notes and a strident edge. Yet there were moments of
beauty, not least in her rendering of ``Vissi d'arte.'' Morris was
in good voice, and is a compelling presence on the stage. His
Scarpia is slightly distant, slightly bland, but there may be a
point: Instead of portraying him as a pillar of malevolent power,
Morris makes him aristocratic and rather ordinary, as if to show
that evil can be as virulent when it is banal as when it is
monumental.

CONGRESSIONAL PANEL SAYS COED MILITARY TRAINING OK
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: SUBS 13thgraf, The commission's, to reflect that Blair was
among those abstaining; pickup: the report's recommendation)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Army, Navy and the Air Force should continue to
train male and female recruits together and allow them to live in
coed housing, according to a preliminary congressional commission
report released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The findings are a blow to conservative House Republicans who
have urged the military to train and house men and women separately
as is done in the Marine Corps.
</P>
<P>
   The Congressional Commission on Military Training and
Gender-Related Issues, which includes former Defense Department
officials and retired military personnel, was created in 1997 in
the wake of military sex scandals. One such scandal, revealed in
late 1996, involved drill instructors engaging in sexual relations
with recruits at the Army's Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problems of the past ... were created by serious failures
in leadership,'' said commission member Robert Dare, a retired Army
command sergeant major. ``They were clearly not a result of men and
women in a training environment.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission, however, was not unanimous in its recommendation
that the Army, Navy and Air Force continue to train men and women
together and in recommending that the Marine Corps maintain its
separate approach.
</P>
<P>
   The panel voted 6 to 1 in favor of the recommendation and three
members abstained. The panel, however, was ideologically polarized
from the beginning as Republicans and Democrats each had a role in
selecting the panel.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Stephen E. Buyer, R-Ind., chairman of the House Armed
Services subcommittee on military personnel, said Congress wanted a
diverse panel in hopes that its recommendations wouldn't be
dismissed as partisan.
</P>
<P>
   The preliminary report said the recommendation was ``based on
our conclusion that in general the ways in which the (military)
services are currently conducting their training, including gender
formats, sustain mission readiness.''
</P>
<P>
   But during a hearing before Buyer's subcommittee, one commission
member, retired Lt. Gen. William Keyes of the Marines, decided to
change his vote to no. He had originally voted to abstain.
</P>
<P>
   He said separate training is good for both sexes and noted that
separate, basic training only lasts for eight to 12 weeks before
male and female recruits would move onto the next training level
together.
</P>
<P>
   The Marines conduct separate training but integrate men and
women after boot camp.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's report is unlikely to settle the debate on coed
training.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's chairwoman, Washington lawyer Anita K. Blair,
was among those who abstained. She said ``there is no way to tell
whether the benefits of gender-integration outweigh the costs.''
</P>
<P>
   The report's recommendation differs from a panel appointed by
Defense Secretary William Cohen and headed by former Sen. Nancy
Kassebaum Baker, R-Kan., that studied military training issues.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the Kassebaum Baker panel recommended that the
military train and house its male and female recruits separately.
</P>
<P>
   Those recommendations gave conservative House Republicans enough
ammunition to attempt to mandate separate training and housing of
male and female service members. The proposal was attached to a
Defense Department reauthorization bill last May, but it was
blocked by a bipartisan group of lawmakers in the Senate led by
Sen. Olympia J. Snowe, R-Maine.
</P>
<P>
   At the time Snowe and others argued that Congress should wait
for the congressional commission's report before deciding whether
to require changes in military training.
</P>
<P>
   Snowe said she was pleased with the congressional commission's
preliminary report.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their conclusions reflect the best judgment of the officers
and enlisted ranks who run and participate in gender-integrated
training programs,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   During the commission's year-long review, one member, retired
Lt. Gen. George Christmas of the Marines, said he heard much more
about shortages of military personnel and about military personnel
being deployed for longer time periods overseas than he did about
gender-related issues. He said the military is stretched
``perilously close to its limits.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission's final report is due April 15.

ANTI-APARTHEID LEADER GUILTY IN FUNDS CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KURT SHILLINGER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG _ The Rev. Allan Boesak, a charismatic leader of
the struggle against apartheid, was convicted Wednesday of
mishandling funds donated in support of his prodemocracy work in
South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The Cape High Court found Boesak guilty of three counts of theft
and one of fraud totaling $208,000, including funds raised by
musician Paul Simon during his ``Graceland'' tour.
</P>
<P>
   He was exonerated on 23 similar charges. The ruling marks the
first time a leading antiapartheid figure was held responsible for
a serious crime since Winnie Mandela's 1991 conviction on
kidnapping and assault.
</P>
<P>
   ``The accused wrongfully and unlawfully appropriated money
intended for children of South Africa,'' said Judge John Foxcroft
in his lengthy judgment.
</P>
<P>
   Boesak, a close friend of President Nelson Mandela, was visible
shaken by the verdict. Sentencing was reserved until next Tuesday,
and it was unclear whether the cleric would serve jail time.
However, a former accountant of Boesak is serving a six-year
sentence after being found guilty on similar charges.
</P>
<P>
   Reaction to the ruling reflected the tensions in a society
struggling to reestablish the rule of law after decades of
apartheid. Opposition parties hailed the verdict as a victory
against ruling class corruption. But many blacks resent any move
that tarnishes the struggle and its heroes. Supporters of the
fallen cleric left the courtroom shouting ``Viva Boesak'' and
``Long Live Boesak.''
</P>
<P>
   Boesak was at the forefront of the liberation struggle in South
Africa during the 1980s. He was one of the founding members of the
United Democratic Front, the internal wing of the then-outlawed
African National Congress. He aided those who suffered at the hands
of the state and spent time in solitary confinement on more than
one occasion.
</P>
<P>
   A week before F. W. de Klerk became president in 1989, Boesak
led 30,000 marchers with Archbishop Desmond Tutu to the steps of
Cape Town's city hall in protest over police brutality in the
townships. He was one of the first allowed to visit Mandela prior
to the future president's release from prison in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The cleric's legal troubles started soon after Mandela's
government rose to power in 1994. Boesak became leader of the ANC
in the Western Cape, but accusations of misuse of funds prevented
him from becoming South Africa's ambassador to the United Nations
in Geneva, a post to which he had been nominated.
</P>
<P>
   Boesak's Foundation for Peace and Justice, a now-defunct
organization whose stated goal was to educate votersand help
victims of apartheid, has been at the center of allegations of
misuse of funds since the early 1990s. The Danish charity DanChurch
Aid alleged in 1994 that money it sent to finance the building of a
church and other facilities in the town of Caravan was instead used
to pay for Boesak's house. Coca-Cola later suspected that at least
part of its $50,000 contribution was similarly misappropriated.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations around Boesak and his organization snowballed. A
local newspaper reported in late 1995 that the cleric had
established a secret trust fund and was diverting charitable
contributions from the foundation without the knowledge of the
donors.
</P>
<P>
   Also in 1995, allegations arose over the apparent misuse of
funds raised by Paul Simon in 1988 for the Children's Trust, a
separate concern of which Boesak, Tutu, and antiapartheid activist
Mary Burton were trustees. Both Tutu and Burton later resigned
their posts.
</P>
<P>
   At the time these details emerged Boesak led a conspicuous
lifestyle: Living in an expensive home, driving an Italian sports
car, and sporting a young new wife shortly after obtaining a
divorce.
</P>
<P>
   Boesak originally faced 32 charges of fraud and theft. Five were
dismissed after a former bookkeeper and key state witness, Freddie
Steenkamp, admitted during the trial last December that he had
falsely accused his former boss to cover his own misdeeds.
Steenkamp is now serving six years for theft.
</P>
<P>
   Foxcroft acquitted Boesak of 23 other charges Wednesday,
including those pertaining to contributions from Coca-Cola,
DanChurch, and the Church of Norway. He was found guilty of
misappropriating $72,000 from funds donated by Simon for the
Children's Trust, stealing more than $120,000 given by a Swedish
aid agency to promote voter education, and diverting $50,000 from
his foundation toward two private homes and sundry comforts for his
wife.
</P>
<P>
   The ANC remained silent after the verdict. So did Mandela, who
twice called on supporters to help Boesak pay for legal costs
during the trial.

Monica Lewinsky's as No. 1 on the New York Times best-seller list
(for March 28), outselling her book in some places by nearly four
to one.
</P>
<P>
   To many people, not necessarily those in book publishing, this
is perhaps surprising because one has the feeling she must be known
to everyone in the world. Even her persona has been reduced to one
word, Monica, like Madonna.
</P>
<P>
   But last week ``Monica's Story'' (St. Martin's Press) by Andrew
Morton was a happening. Now it's merely a book. And there's very
little in it that hasn't been known for months, and even those tiny
slivers of fresh confession were bestowed on us in her bland
television interview with Barbara Walters.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanopoulos' ``All Too Human: A Political Education'' (Little
Brown), on the other hand, has for many the slight sense of
betrayal that intrigues the peeper in all of us.
</P>
<P>
   It does present a sketchy new look at the Clinton White House,
with little discussion of policy, and Stephanopoulos, who has
started a 25-city book tour that includes national television
interviews and is scheduled to last into May, is after all a
professional spin-master who was there and who told, somewhat.
</P>
<P>
   Knowledgeable and boyishly self-deprecatory, he is an effective
interviewee, so it's not entirely surprising that his book's sales
got off to such a fast start. What was surprising to many in book
publishing was the increase that followed a long excerpt in
Newsweek last week.
</P>
<P>
   Usually such extensive excerpting sates the public's need to
know; in this case the excerpt resonated into more book sales, in
part because of Stephanopoulos' skills in presenting his material,
both in the book and in person in interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, while few in book publishing thought that Ms.
Lewinsky's book would have but a hasty moment at the top because of
the familiarity and tedium of the material, Stephanopoulos' book is
not only a good read but also has the embroidery of controversy
about it, the question of propriety.
</P>
<P>
   He signed on to be the president's man. He had the access. And
he talked about the lies and the quirkiness and even the
domesticity of the White House. The tidbits have the appeal of
salted peanuts. One is not enough. (Ms. Lewinsky's book dropped to
No. 3 on the Times hard-cover nonfiction list for March 28 and is
expected to keep falling. ``The Greatest Generation'' by Tom
Brokaw, published by Random House, is No. 2).
</P>
<P>
   Stephanopoulos rode being the president's man to fame and a
reported $2.85 million book contract. So far the publisher has gone
back to press five times, and nearly 600,000 copies are in print.
Ms. Lewinsky's sexual fumblings with the president earned a book
advance that was said to be about $600,000.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to Stephanopoulos, the Kennedy men _ Theodore C.
Sorensen, Pierre Salinger and Arthur Schlesinger Jr. _ signed on
and have stayed quiet, except for policy matters, for all these
years, and the mind reels when one thinks of the gamy tales they
might have told. Also, by contrast, President Kennedy was loyal to
his people.
</P>
<P>
   What has changed between the two presidencies are the public's
standards for presidential behavior, the apparent national craving
for dish, and book publishing, which since President Reagan's
administration has been willing to pay so much money for
presidential literary bric-a-brac.
</P>
<P>
   John Lewis Gaddis, a Yale history professor, said: ``It's
probably fair to say that in the end most'' important presidential
advisers ``have broken down and overcome whatever scruples they
have and have done memoirs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There used to be the Marshall principle, he said, invoking the
creator of the postwar plan for European recovery. ``When General
Marshall left after being secretary of state and secretary of
defense, he said he wouldn't write a memoir, that it would be a
betrayal of confidence, and he never did.''
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, professor Gaddis said: ``Is writing
the memoir a betrayal or not? The dilemma is basically that if you
don't write your memoir, then you tend to sink into the obscurity
of history. It's too lucrative not to; I would guess that for any
president or Cabinet officer who hires anyone to work for them in a
confidential capacity, it would only be realistic for them to
expect a memoir to come.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Still, Henry Kissinger, in his memoirs, the third volume of
which, ``Years of Renewal'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster), is in the
bookstores, took a somewhat middle ground. He lets the reader know
there were certain people he didn't like; he had a rueful attitude
toward President Nixon; but, in the end, he didn't serve people up
with trivia.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanopoulos' editor, Bill Phillips, senior executive editor
at Little, Brown, said that it was not fair to criticize the former
White House aide for betrayal ``when the book is more critical of
the author's shortcomings than of anyone else.'' Stephanopoulos
added that he saw his book not as an insider tell-all, but a story
of his adventure in government, a sort of Andy Hardy in the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Stephanopoulos' experiences are his to sell, and he
can make the case that in lying to him and other staff members
about Ms. Lewinsky, it was the president who betrayed, not his
staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought to myself, the tests I made, was what I had to say
relevant, fair and accurate,'' Stephanopoulos said in a telephone
interview on his book tour. ``I did my best to pick representative
moments that were fun and interesting.'' The book came before the
Monica Lewinsky story, but now, he said, ``the issues raised by
Gennifer Flowers and the draft became more important after Monica;
they showed the stepping stones of a pattern.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``It's like the novel `Portnoy's Complaint.' It was
quite controversial at first, and then it became a novel. Now my
book is an event, but soon it will be a book again.''
</P>
<P>
   Such presidential events are not new, we all now know. When
James T. Callender broke the story of President Jefferson and Sally
Hemings in The Richmond Recorder in 1802, the president's men
denied it, in essence wagging their fingers and insisting he didn't
have sex with that woman. One can only wonder if Jefferson had a
Stephanopoulos who chose silence and discretion rather than, say, a
$500 book advance.

RESEARCHERS REPORT HEARTBURN-CANCER LINK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY TYE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Heartburn deserves respect.
</P>
<P>
   That's the warning researchers sounded Wednesday based on new
evidence that severe, recurrent, long-lasting heartburn can be an
early warning sign for a virulent form of cancer of the esophagus.
That warning is especially significant because while the overall
incidence of such cancers is small, it's increasing faster than any
other cancer in America.
</P>
<P>
   Heartburn may be the most common health complaint, with an
estimated 20 million Americans suffering it every day and 120
million getting it once a month.
</P>
<P>
   So who should worry, and what should they do?
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember the funny commercial about spicy meatballs? We've
trivialized heartburn when we should be taking it seriously,'' says
Dr. Michael Wolfe, chief of gastroenterology at Boston Medical
Center and a national expert on the condition. Any patient whose
heartburn persists for more than five years, he adds, should be
given an endoscopy test to look for pre-cancerous cells.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Stuart Spechler, another renowned specialist in the field
who teaches at the University of Texas, is a bit slower to order
the test. His approach, he says, is, ``If someone comes in with
heartburn and has no other warning symptoms like difficulty
swallowing, fever, bleeding or weight loss, I tell them to treat
the heartburn for four to eight weeks with whatever medications we
have. If the symptoms go away and never come back I don't do
anything, but if they don't go away I do an endoscopy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line,'' he adds, ``is that heartburn is a symptom
that has to be taken seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Concerns about heartburn and its links to cancer aren't new, but
the study in the current New England Journal of Medicine is giving
them new weight. Researchers at Sweden's Karolinska Institute
looked at all Swedes under 80 living there from the end of 1994 to
the end of 1997, identifying those with esophageal adenocarcinoma,
or the glandular form of cancer of the esophagus that is rising so
fast. Then, using those patients and others with cancer of the
stomach or with no cancer, they explored whether the esophageal
cancer was linked with heartburn and with the regurgitation of
acidified food.
</P>
<P>
   The findings were dramatic: The risk of esophageal
adenocarcinoma was nearly eight times higher among people in whom
heartburn, regurgitation or both occurred at least once a week, and
it was almost 11 times higher among those who suffered the symptoms
at night.
</P>
<P>
   The risk of esophageal cancer rose again when the heartburn and
regurgitation lasted longer, were more severe and kept coming back,
although the link was weak between those symptoms and stomach
cancer. And while antacids and other treatments can relieve
heartburn, there's no evidence that they reduce the risk of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The attention to that glandular form of esophageal cancer, and
its possible warning signs or causes, has grown in recent years as
the cancer itself has spread. While the chance that anyone with
heartburn has the disease is extremely slight, since there are only
about 6,000 cases of adenocarcinoma a year in America, it is the
nation's fastest-growing form of cancer, and is especially
prevalent among white men.
</P>
<P>
   The rapid increase of this cancer may be linked to recent
success in battling Helicobacter pylori, a bacterial infection that
causes ulcers and gastric cancer but apparently offers protection
against cancer of the esophagus.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfe believes that the acid that causes heartburn also damages
the lining of the esophagus and may produce a precancerous
condition known as Barrett's esophagus. Others aren't sure of the
mechanism, but say what matters is that heartburn can signal the
potential for cancer, and that if precancerous cells are detected
early the chance of effective treatment rises dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   The question that doctors are debating is which heartburn
patients are at risk of cancer, and whether they should be given an
edoscopy, which costs about $500 and involves the insertion of a
small flexible tube through the mouth into the esophagus. Biopsies
typically are taken of any suspicious-looking areas.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Sidney Cohen, chairman of medicine at Temple University
Medical School in Philadelphia and author of an editorial on the
topic in the current New England Journal, says that while ``99
percent of the individuals with heartburn will not get cancer, the
individuals who get this type of cancer have a very bad outcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen worries that by the time additional symptoms show up it
may be too late to check the cancer. ``I'm very bullish,'' he adds.
``I say that if heartburn is serious enough to bring a patient to a
doctor, that patient should have an endoscopy.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. J. Thomas LaMont, chief of gastroenterology at Beth
Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, calls that approach ``a
little radical. You'd need an army of endoscopists and the yield
would be so low.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are having frequent heartburn which is not responsive
to medications, and if you're having difficulty swallowing, then
you should consult a physician,'' LaMont adds. ``And the physician
should consider a look with an endoscope.''

 &HT;    F-22 UNDER FIRE
 &HT;    Moving in (f) financial and (w) Washington categories
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Federal auditors Wednesday urged Congress to slow
production of the futuristic F-22 fighter and warned that
insufficient testing plus delays in computer systems have put the
program on a course toward major cost overruns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a high risk endeavor,'' Louis J. Rodrigues, a defense
auditor for the General Accounting Office, told a Senate Armed
Services subcommittee hearing at which defenders offered generally
glowing reports about the F-22.
</P>
<P>
   Rodrigues said that ``it is unlikely'' that the Air Force will
be able to keep its schedule or its $18.9 billion budget for the
aircraft, which will be assembled by Lockheed Martin at the
company's Marietta, Ga., plant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying we don't need the F-22,'' said Rodrigues, whose
agency serves as the investigative arm of Congress. However, he
told the senators that he opposed ``increasing the rate of
production on an aircraft that we're having trouble producing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force wants to start production of the F-22 this year,
with an initial contract for six fighters.
</P>
<P>
   Rodrigues noted that only 5 percent of the planned flight tests
have been completed, in part because of troubles with wing
attachment fittings and welding in the fuselage, work that is being
performed by Seattle-based Boeing. Rodrigues estimated that cost
overruns were already as much as $767 million and recommended
Congress require the Air Force to make certain that the high-tech
prototypes work before opening up the production line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know what happens once we get everybody in jobs,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The remark drew a rejoinder from one avowed booster of the F-22.
``I know what happens when we get everybody employed,'' said Sen.
Max Cleland (D-Ga.). ``They're in Georgia!''
</P>
<P>
   Cleland, who had visited Edwards Air Force Base in California to
see the first two F-22s, said he was pleased with the
``meticulous'' testing.
</P>
<P>
   Under his friendly questioning, Air Force acquisition and
management official Darleen A. Druyun said that despite some
``slips'' in the schedule, she had a ``high level of confidence''
that the program would be back on track and that ``costs will be
back under control'' by next June.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Druyun testified earlier that the Air Force had listed
the savings from reduced testing as one of the efficiencies to
offset rising costs elsewhere in the program.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph Lieberman (D-Conn.), said he was ``troubled by
potential for cost growth'' for the aircraft, and called the
testimony ''unsettling.'' He said, ''It seems we're having serious
problems.''

IOC OUTS SIX FOR TAKING PAYOFFS FROM SALT LAKE CITY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAUSANNE, Switzerland _ The International Olympic Committee
began its radical makeover with an unprecedented purge Wednesday,
expelling six members who took improper payoffs from the Salt Lake
City bidders for the 2002 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   The expulsions came on the heels of a rousing vote of confidence
for the embattled IOC president, Juan Antonio Samaranch, who has
weathered months of calls for his resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday the IOC is expected to follow through on the rest of
the changes it promised in the wake of the worst scandal in its
105-year history: allowing members to vote for future host cities
only after a smaller selection group has picked two finalists;
creating an independent ethics commission to oversee members'
behavior; and setting up a study group of two dozen people, half of
them prominent outsiders, to reform by year's end everything from
how the IOC chooses its members to how it distributes its money.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC has been under strong pressure from corporate sponsors
and political leaders to right itself in the aftermath of the Salt
Lake scandal, in which organizers were found to have plied IOC
members with some $1.2 million worth of gifts, cash, travel,
scholarships, medical care, and other inducements.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're starting to deliver on what we've said we would from the
beginning of the crisis,'' said IOC vice president Richard Pound of
Canada, who chaired the investigative panel that recommended the
expulsions. ``We will put our own house in order and respond to the
concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   The first step was Wednesday's purge. The IOC, which had not
ousted a member in 37 years, voted by secret ballot to dismiss
Jean-Claude Ganga of the Congo, Zein El Abdin Ahmed Abdel Gadir of
Sudan, Sergio Santander Fantini of Chile, Agustin Arroyo of
Ecuador, Lamine Keita of Mali, and Seiuli Paul Wallwork of Western
Samoa. Four other members _ Bashir Mohamed Attarabulsi of Libya,
Pirjo Haggman of Finland, Charles Mukora of Kenya, and David
Sibandze of Swaziland _ had already resigned.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch, the IOC president since 1980, received an 86-2 vote
of confidence, with two incomplete ballots among the 90 members
voting by secret ballot.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is the best person to see us through this crisis,'' said US
member Anita DeFrantz, of the 78-year-old Samaranch.
</P>
<P>
   Calling this the IOC's most important meeting ever, Samaranch
opened the session with a frank and somber speech urging the
members to expel the wrongdoers and approve the reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is my firm conviction that unless we act quickly,
decisively, and unanimously at this extraordinary session,''
Samaranch said, ``the damage which may be done to the Olympic
movement and to the IOC as a result of the recent disclosures will
be very, very serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch said he accepted responsibility for the Salt Lake
scandal ``even if some of the conduct by bidding cities has itself
been unethical.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the IOC that is being judged, and the IOC that must deal
with the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch said he wanted to lead the IOC through its period of
crisis and the implementation of reforms, but he signaled that he
might not serve out his entire term, which expires in 2001. ``I
have personally given the best of myself to the Olympic movement
over the last 18 years and. . . . my last service to Olympism would
be to structure our organization in order to enter the new
millennium stronger than ever,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not since 1962, when Saul Cristavao Ferreira Pires of Portugal
was thrown out for allowing his family's expenses to be paid to the
1960 Summer Olympics, had the IOC expelled one of its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one in the room had gone through the expulsion of a
member,'' said Craig Reedie of Great Britain. ``People were
uncomfortable with the fact that they had to be doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet had the six not been expelled, members said, the IOC would
have been widely seen as incapable of policing itself and the
executive board, which was unanimous for expulsion, would have
stepped down in protest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all would have resigned,'' said Jacques Rogge of Belgium.
``That is for certain.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the six members were excluded from voting, each was given
20 minutes to defend himself before the full body, which considered
the issue behind closed doors for five hours. ``They all came, they
were all eloquent, and they all did their best to explain why they
should not be expelled,'' said DeFrantz.
</P>
<P>
   But all six were dismissed by more than the required two-thirds
margin. The vote against Ganga, who allegedly took more than a
quarter-million dollars in payoffs and gifts for himself and his
family, was 88-2. The only remotely close vote was for Wallwork,
who denied knowing that his wife had solicited a $30,000 loan from
former Salt Lake bid chief Tom Welch. The vote against Wallwork was
67-19.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who have been expelled today, I do not plead for them at
all,'' said Hein Verbruggen of the Netherlands, whose countryman,
Anthonius Geesink, earlier had received a warning after Salt Lake
committee members contributed $5,000 to a foundation in his name.
</P>
<P>
   Some members were said to be annoyed that the six hadn't
resigned earlier and spared their colleagues the distasteful duty
of drumming them out. But the prevailing mood in the meeting room
at the Palais de Beaulieu, said Rogge, was ``dignified sadness.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I hated every second of it,'' he added. ``I hated the last
three months of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The scandal has turned the august IOC inside out and set
colleague against colleague. At Tuesday's board meeting, director
general Francois Carrard and Kim Un-yong of South Korea, who has
been censured and is still under investigation for his role in the
Salt Lake scandal, squared off in a shouting match that nearly came
to blows when the 67-year-old Kim, who heads the world taekwondo
federation, struck a menacing martial arts pose that sent Carrard
fleeing.
</P>
<P>
   ``A minor incident,'' Carrard said Wednesday. ``I'm physically
fine.''
</P>
<P>
   The tensions, building since December, finally achieved
catharsis in the most public and painful day the Lords of the Rings
had ever endured.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're reaching the end of the beginning,'' said Pound. ``It
was painful, but if we hadn't done it, it would have been difficult
to move on. It would be something on our back all the time.''

<P>
   NAIROBI, Kenya _ Eritrea said Wednesday that it had repulsed
Ethiopian troops after a three-day battle along their disputed
border, in fighting that cost the lives of at least several hundred
soldiers and perhaps many more.
</P>
<P>
   Eritrea seemed so confident of victory that the army escorted
foreign journalists to the front on Tuesday for the first time in
nearly a month. Reuters reported that at least 300 Ethiopian
soldiers lay dead along a small stretch of the central front.
</P>
<P>
   But Ethiopia called it a ``drama staged for foreign
journalists,'' accusing Eritrea of planting its own dead and
burnt-out tanks in the battlefield to improve its image after
suffering a major defeat to the west late last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do those reporting know that the destroyed tanks that are
presented belong to Ethiopia, or that the smell of rotting corpses
indeed comes from dead Ethiopian soldiers?'' Ethiopia said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign diplomats in both nations said they generally believed
Eritrea's version of the battles, which began early Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   A Western diplomat in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, said
he believed that Ethiopia had tried to repeat the success it had
had in late February, when it expelled Eritrean forces from the
Badame region, the main area in dispute. But he said it was unclear
if the fighting was in fact Ethiopia's major push in the region,
near Tsorona, Eritrea, about 70 miles southeast of Asmara, the
capital. They speculated that the attack may have been partly a
probe for weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
   Eritrea, however, said it had ``completely foiled'' a ``major
offensive,'' destroying 57 tanks, capturing another six and
shooting down an Ethiopian fighter plane, a MIG-23, on Monday.
Yemane Ghebremeskel, an Eritrean spokesman, ridiculed Ethiopia's
suggestion that it had planted the bodies. ``They have suffered a
big defeat and they want to downplay it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While refusing to disclose Eritrean casualties, he said that
well over 9,000 Ethiopians had died in the fighting. Ethiopia
denied the claim.
</P>
<P>
   The war between Ethiopia and Eritrea, though a local dispute in
the remote highlands on the Horn of Africa, has been a major
concern to outside nations, in part because of the question of
casualties. Estimates by diplomats and military analysts run from
10,000 dead to twice that or more. Each side is well armed.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute traces back to 1993, when Eritrea separated amicably
from Ethiopia but their 600-mile border was not settled. Fighting
broke out in May 1998, when Eritrea claimed the Badame region and
sent in troops.
</P>
<P>
   After an eight-month lull, fighting resumed last month, and
Ethiopia pushed Eritrean soldiers out of Badame. But fighting
continues because Ethiopia asserts that Eritrean troops still
occupy three other areas it says belong to Ethiopia.

THE SPORT THAT'S FASTER THAN A JET FIGHTER 
</HEADLINE>
 
(Repeating to correct slug)  (DUPLICATION NOTICE: Also filed in category `s')

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAINESVILLE, Fla. _ Take your 100 mph fastballs. Forget about
your Indy racers, your jet fighters and your spaceships, too. They
are all icebergs when compared to National Hot Rod Association drag
racers.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the fastest-accelerating creations in the world,''
said Don Robertson, general manager of Gainesville Raceway and
point man for the Mac Tools Gatornationals. ``They're faster than
an F-15 flying off an aircraft carrier. People ask, `Faster than
the space shuttle?' Yes, faster than the space shuttle.''
</P>
<P>
   Gatornationals, one of the NHRA Winston Drag Racing Series'
longest-running events, turns 30 this year and shows no signs of
slowing down _ and that's whether you're talking about the raw
speed spectacle or the more than 100,000 speed worshippers who come
to experience it. Qualifying races begin Thursday and the final
race is Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Although corporate sponsorship is a major force in the sport
today, there are many drivers who don't have big backing. They
invest huge amounts of time, work and money in their cars, trucks
and bikes.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, despite continually improving safety features, they
pay a price by being seriously injured, or even killed. But they
know that risk is part of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The element of danger might be part of the attraction for
spectators. But I think if the drivers had their choice, they'd
like to drive 300 mph in perfectly safe conditions,'' said Mike
Lewis, a former driver and NHRA announcer who has been a part of
every Gatornationals. ``The Top Fuel and Funny Car people are like
Chuck Yeager in the X-1 days. They're in uncharted territory.''
</P>
<P>
   It's always been that way for Gatornationals and drag racing in
general.
</P>
<P>
   The NHRA was already a few years old when organization founder
Wally Parks toured the newly built Gainesville Raceway in 1969 and
approved a new event. The other venues were in the West; one in the
South made sense, in part because of the weather.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Gainesville became a meeting point, not only for
rival racers, but also for merchandisers and distributors to show
new wares and make contacts, and for car buffs to get away from the
chill of March.
</P>
<P>
   Times in the early years were slow by today's standards. But it
wasn't long before Gainesville and Gatornationals gained a
reputation for hospitality and a fast track.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd all come to town and there would be billboards welcoming
us,'' Lewis said. ``People really made us feel special when we came
to Gainesville, whether they were the hotel people, law enforcement
or the community in general. It probably helped that it was also
very fun for the people coming out of the cold weather.''
</P>
<P>
   On the track, Don ``Big Daddy'' Garlits became the first
dominant figure. He won the first of four Top Fuel titles in 1972,
running a 6.17-second lap at 243.90 mph. He set the pace through
the '70s with two more championships at Gainesville.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, Garlits came back with the radically designed JP-1,
which he said was designed to ``punch a hole in the atmosphere,
allowing the rest of the car to drive through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Only Garlits knows if he truly entered another dimension, but
the car did blow away previous course records with a 5.503-second
lap at 268.65 mph, good for his fourth Gatornationals win.
</P>
<P>
   Don ``The Snake'' Prudhomme was to Funny Cars in the early years
what Garlits was to Top Fuel _ the best and the fastest at
Gainesville and a huge crowd favorite. He won three titles in the
'70s. In 1975, his Monza ran 6.52 at 172.74 _ more than a second
better than Dale Funk's winning elapsed time of that year in Top
Fuel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every now and then the funny cars catch up and the dragsters
pick themselves up and assert themselves again,'' Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   Enough numbers. You want human interest? How about a father-son
story.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Connie and Scott Kalitta met in the final of the Top
Fuel competition. Scott was faster in the early rounds, but Dad was
faster when it counted _ in the final.
</P>
<P>
   Drag racing is one of the few sports where age and gender truly
don't matter. This has been proved often at Gatornationals, where
Eddie Hill won his second consecutive Top Fuel title in 1993 _ at
age 57.
</P>
<P>
   In the early '90s, Warren Johnson ruled the pro stock category,
winning here every year from 1991 to 1994. Toss in his victories in
1984 and '85 and you have the most dominant Gatornationals racer in
any class.
</P>
<P>
   Today, at an age when many mull retirement, Johnson, 55, still
works on getting that extra microsecond. Johnson won again at
Gainesville last year _ one of his nine victories during the 1998
Winston Series.
</P>
<P>
   Woman-driver jokes don't fly at Gainesville Raceway, but woman
drivers do. Shirley Muldowney captured Top Fuel honors in 1981 and
1982. In 1990 Vonnie Mills and Janice Siegal won in Super Gas and
Super Comp, respectively. Mills was injured when her '88 Beretta
caught fire at the end of her final run, but she returned from the
hospital in time to be honored at the winners' circle.
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The recent performance exploits of John Force in Funny Cars, and
Kenny Bernstein and Joe Amato in Top Fuel, are well-documented;
they've paved the way to make 300 mph passes as close to routine as
anything can be in the sport.
</P>
<P>
   Some drag racing veterans say the increased speeds are mostly
due to big-money sponsorship allowing the best in technology.
</P>
<P>
   Although tracks, especially Gainesville, are safer now, and drag
racing does have a bit of a video game feel to it because of the
high-tech aspect, the sport is still tough _ and still dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Darrell Gwynn. In 1989 and '90, he won Top Fuel at
Gainesville and was the NHRA's rising star. But he was paralyzed
below the chest and lost part of an arm at an exhibition in England
one month after his 1990 Gatornationals win. Gwynn later made an
emotional return to Gainesville as a team manager and car owner.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who still doesn't believe the danger only has to look
back to 1997 and Al Hofmann. He came to Gatornationals that year
without corporate backing and had lost ace crew chief Tom Anderson.
He left with a Funny Car victory but with terrible injuries as his
car caught fire at the end of his victorious run.
</P>
<P>
   ``The engine let go near the finish line,'' Lewis said. ``The
resulting fire burned away the parachutes and exploded the rear
tires, sending Hofmann on a collision course with the top-end
guardrail.
</P>
<P>
   When the team should have been sipping champagne, they found
themselves gathered instead at the hospital to comfort Hofmann.
``The financial gain of the victory was wiped out and Hofmann
required months to recover from his injuries,'' Lewis said
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Hofmann was back competing at Gainesville.
</P>
<P>
   Now that's tough.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's the allure of drag racing. In most sports, pure
speed is a natural gift _ a God-given talent that a few have and
most cannot even dream to attain.
</P>
<P>
   In drag racing, the fastest of sports, there is, of course, some
natural ability involved _ reflexes are of paramount importance.
But so are teamwork, technology and tenacity. Drag racing success
today comes from a marriage of Space Age wizardry and undeniable
human spirit. Speed thrills _ especially when it's obvious some
work was put into it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The status quo is never good enough in this sport,'' said
Robertson, the general manager of Gainesville Raceway. ``Drag
racers are by nature a very innovative, cutting-edge type of group.
It's never a sport of complacency.''
</P>
<P>
   Age 30 is when the speed merchants in other sports start slowing
down. But, born in 1970, Gatornationals will just get faster and
faster.`

RENO URGES LAWMAKERS TO END INDEPENDENT COUNSEL LAW 

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno, under fire for not
seeking an outside prosecutor to examine presidential fund-raising,
urged Congress on Wednesday to let the Independent Counsel Act die
July 1 and allow the Justice Department to conduct criminal
investigations of high-level officials.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., Reno's staunchest congressional
critic, said the attorney general cannot be trusted to conduct a
vigorous investigation of senior government officials, particularly
her boss, President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The senator, who chairs the Senate Governmental Affairs
Committee, cited Reno's refusal to seek an independent counsel to
examine Clinton's alleged illegal fund-raising during his 1996
re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Reno, appearing before Thompson's committee, said the
post-Watergate era independent counsel law has failed to accomplish
its goal of ensuring public confidence in the U.S. government's
ability to prosecute federal executive-branch officials. Instead
the statute has fomented widespread cynicism of prosecutors and the
way they investigate officials, and deepened the partisan divide on
Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Reno pointedly referred to the Republican senator's vociferous
criticism of the Democratic Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   Under the controversial law, an attorney general may ask a
special panel of three federal judges to appoint an independent
counsel if she receives specific and credible evidence of
wrongdoing by a senior executive-branch official. In her six years
as attorney general, Reno has sought the appointment of seven
independent counsels, including Kenneth Starr, whose controversial
investigation of Clinton's effort to conceal an extramarital affair
with Monica Lewinsky led to the president's impeachment and Senate
acquittal last month.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the independent counsel that Reno did not seek that
has drawn the most criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, who conducted several months of hearings on the
Clinton campaign issue in 1997, said Reno should have sought an
independent counsel to investigate credible allegations that the
president raised $44 million for the re-election campaign, even
though his acceptance of $62 million in public campaign funds
legally barred him from raising more money.
</P>
<P>
   ``The failure to appoint an independent counsel when it is
clearly called for, not only defeats the purpose of the statute,
but enhances the very cynicism and loss of public confidence that
motivated the creation of the statute in the first place,'' said
Thompson. The senator said he has not decided whether the
independent counsel law should be killed, retained or amended.
</P>
<P>
   FBI Director Louis Freeh and Charles La Bella, former head of
the Justice Department's investigation of campaign irregularities,
had privately urged Reno to name an independent counsel in the
campaign-finance case. Freeh and La Bella, in separate memos to
Reno, expressed the same concerns Thompson did about her conflict
of interest.
</P>
<P>
   But Reno defended her actions, indicating that the Justice
Department is investigating the alleged campaign violations. She
cited Thompson's criticism of her actions as evidence that the
independent counsel law improperly brings politics into what is
supposed to be the neutral decision of whether to launch a criminal
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have come to believe that the statute puts the attorney
general in a no-win situation,'' Reno said. ``An attorney general
is criticized if she triggers the statute and criticized if she
doesn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno, who had endorsed reauthorization of the act in 1993, said
she now seeks the ``structurally flawed'' law's demise because her
six years of experience with the controversial statute has shown
her that the law gives independent counsels too much power. Unlike
other prosecutors, independent counsels have unlimited budgets and
time to investigate alleged wrongdoing, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is as if we have created a fourth branch of government,''
Reno said. ``In trying to ensure independence, the statute creates
a new category of prosecutors who have ... no competing public
duties and no need to make difficult decisions about how to
allocate scarce resources.''
</P>
<P>
   But Reno conceded that attorneys general, to avoid a conflict of
interest, might need to appoint special prosecutors from outside
the Justice Department to handle investigations of alleged
wrongdoing by high-ranking officials. But these outside attorneys
should have limited budgets, be well-qualified and preferably be
from the party not in office, she said.
</P>
<P>
   In defense of her proposal, Reno said a special prosecutor, Leon
Jaworski, successfully investigated the Watergate scandal, which
led to President Richard Nixon's 1974 resignation and the
conviction of many of his aides. Despite that success, Congress
reacted to the episode by enacting the independent counsel law four
years later, the attorney general said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps the real lesson of our nation's experience with the
special prosecutor during Watergate is not that the old system was
broken, but that it worked,'' Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   La Bella, also appearing before Thompson's Committee, said
independent counsels are not needed to investigate official
wrongdoing. Instead, attorneys general should turn to experienced
career prosecutors who have no ties to any particular
administration to conduct the investigations.
</P>
<P>
   John Barrett, who was an aid to independent counsel Lawrence
Walsh during the Iran-Contra investigation, said the law should be
amended rather than scrapped. For example, he said the Justice
Department should be empowered to conduct preliminary
investigations of high-ranking government officials, complete with
grand juries, subpoenas and plea bargains.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would help attorneys general make better-informed choices
about which matters really need to be investigated by an
outsider,'' Barrett told the committee.

ISRAELI POLITICIAN CONVICTED OF CORRUPTION
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ A powerful, charismatic Israeli politician was
convicted Wednesday on corruption charges in a verdict that
outraged the ultra-Orthodox Sephardic Jews who consider him the
champion of their underclass community.
</P>
<P>
   While the Jerusalem District Court was ringed with police
officers after death threats against the judges, supporters of the
politician, Aryeh Deri, greeted the decision with angry words and
protest songs but not violence.
</P>
<P>
   They proclaimed Deri, a Moroccan-born rabbi who heads the Shas
Party, to be a victim of bias against religious Jews and Sephardic
Jews of Middle Eastern and North African origin.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had to take him down because he was getting too
powerful,'' said David Abergil, a Moroccan immigrant who traveled
from southern Israel to await the verdict outside the courthouse.
``We feel that all the Sephardi people are being convicted because
Deri had the God-blessed brains to put the rest of us on the map.''
</P>
<P>
   Deri, whose party holds 10 seats in the 120-member Parliament,
has played a pivotal role in many governments and exercised a good
deal of influence in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's governing
coalition. Netanyahu wants and needs the support of Shas to win
re-election on May 17.
</P>
<P>
   The court, in a two-hour live broadcast, handed down its
blistering decision against Deri, 40, who built Shas into Israel's
third-largest party, after Likud and Labor. Reading excerpts from
the long verdict, Deputy Chief Judge Yaacov Tzemah pronounced Deri
guilty of bribery, fraud and breach of public trust. He also
accused him of obstructing justice during the nine-year case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deri waged a war against the police during the investigation,
and against the prosecution during the trial,'' the judge said as
Deri fixed his gaze on the courtroom floor. ``Deri alleged they
were trying not only to ruin him but to ruin his party, that they
were conducting blood libel against him.''
</P>
<P>
   Deri is now forced to place his faith in the liberal Supreme
Court; his lawyer announced Wednesday that he is appealing the
conviction to the institution that religious Jews most malign.
</P>
<P>
   In the afternoon Deri gave a brief statement at his office.
``I'm sure if I was acquitted, I'd feel happier,'' he said. ``But I
must say I bear no grudge against anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu, in an unusually brief news conference, expressed his
sympathy to the family of Deri, saying, ``My heart is with them.''
At the same time, he called on Deri's supporters to ``show
restraint and respect the rule of law.''
</P>
<P>
   Deri's colleagues in Shas vowed that the verdict would not
derail the party. ``No power in the world will destroy us,'' said
Shlomo Benizri, a member of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts said they expected that Shas would
successfully use the verdict to redouble its partisans' commitment
to a party that defends their rights against a system that they say
seeks to keep them down.
</P>
<P>
   With a trim black beard and small black skullcap, the
street-smart Deri made a political splash when he was still in his
20s.
</P>
<P>
   Under the tutelage of the party's spiritual adviser, Rabbi
Ovadia Yosef, Deri built Shas into a political force by defending
the interests of Sephardim and by building a social service and an
educational system, with free clinics, free nursery schools and
state-subsidized yeshivas, or religious schools.
</P>
<P>
   Deri started his professional life as an administrator of the
Yad Labanim Yeshiva in Jerusalem. He left to become a civil servant
at the Interior Ministry, ending up as interior minister under
three different governments from 1988 to 1993. During that time he
became a master of backroom politics.
</P>
<P>
   He resigned when he was indicted on the corruption charges in
this case, in which the court found that he had developed and
sustained an illegal relationship with his old yeshiva friends once
in government.
</P>
<P>
   The court found that from 1985 to 1989, Deri accepted $155,000
in bribes in exchange for steering ``substantial'' public funds to
the yeshiva, whose directors paid him off partly with the public
funds themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was as if Deri received a tithing of the money given to the
yeshiva, and often it was much more than 10 percent,'' Tzemah said.
</P>
<P>
   The court determined that the bribes included cash payments
directly into his bank accounts, trips to London and New York and
help in buying a $445,000 luxury duplex apartment in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Deri also appointed one yeshiva director to be his assistant at
the Interior Ministry and named another to a salaried post as the
head of a municipal council in the Negev region.
</P>
<P>
   The three men who ran the yeshiva were also convicted of
corruption charges today.
</P>
<P>
   Sentencing is scheduled for next week. The charges carry a
possible maximum penalty of 21 years in prison.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Israelis, who are fascinated by Deri, were riveted to their
radios and televisions Wednesday morning. Although the police
feared riots, Deri and Yosef cautioned their followers to remain
calm, and their followers generally obey.
</P>
<P>
   At 4:30 a.m., Deri started his day in prayer at the Cave of the
Patriarchs in Hebron. From there he proceeded to a circumcision
ceremony, which is supposed to bring those attending a blessing
from the prophet Elijah. Then he sought blessings from both Yosef
and Rabbi Yitzhak Kedouri, a kabalist rabbi who is an important
mystical figure in the religious Sephardic community. Finally, he
proceeded to the courthouse, from which he emerged pale, to cheers
from his supporters, who yelled, ``They spilt your blood.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Nazism, racism,'' said Ezra Levy, 21, a yeshiva student.
``It's the black and white reality of our society.''
</P>
<P>
   By evening, when Deri gave a televised news conference, he was
back in fighting form, seated beside Yosef in his luxury duplex
apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't take bribes from anyone and certainly not from my
beloved friends,'' he said. ``This is a trial that the Holy One,
blessed be He, has given me to test me, and I hope that I will
pass.''
</P>
<P>
   When reporters tried to ask Deri questions, Yosef grew angry.
``What do you want?'' he said. ``Get out of here. Aryeh is
innocent.''
</P>
<P>
   Turning to Deri as Shas members pushed cameramen out the door,
Yosef said: ``They're hostile. I forbid you to answer them.''

AD LOGO ON EDITORIAL INSERT KILLS AWARD FOR A MAGAZINE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ALEX KUCZYNSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the first time in its 33-year history, the American Society
of Magazine Editors has stripped a magazine of nominations for the
society's National Magazine awards for not complying with
guidelines regarding the separation of advertising and editorial
content.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine in question, This Old House, which is published by
Time Publishing Ventures Inc., a Time Inc. unit of Time Warner, was
to receive one nomination for the coveted category of General
Excellence and one for Design.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, however, the judging committee, made up of 67
magazine editors and publishers, decided that the magazine was in
violation because for the last several months it had published a
five-page editorial insert poster that read at the bottom, ``This
poster is brought to you by Ace Hardware, the source for all your
hardware needs.'' The word ``Ace'' appears in the distinctive bold
red letters of the company logo. Ace Hardware did not pay for the
placement in the poster, which has featured themes like hardware
and insects.
</P>
<P>
   The positioning of the Ace Hardware logo on an editorial section
creates the impression that the magazine editors are endorsing a
product, according to ASME.
</P>
<P>
   The society's nominee list was compiled several weeks ago and is
to be announced Thursday. The actual awards, chosen by the same
67-member panel, are to be announced in late April. Removal of This
Old House from the list points to the growing concern about
dissolving barriers between advertising and editorial content.
</P>
<P>
   Marlene Kahan, executive director of the society, said it had
previously called the violation to the attention of the magazine's
editors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pointed out a very clear violation of our guidelines
several times,'' she said. ``One of our rules clearly states that
you cannot have an advertiser logo on an editorial page of the
magazine.''
</P>
<P>
   Eric G. Thorkilsen, president of This Old House, argued that
because Ace Hardware was one of three national sponsors for the
magazine's popular companion public television program, ``This Old
House,'' he felt obliged to give the hardware company ``the
opportunity to have premium placing _ we consider it an obligation
as a licensee.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the editorial team at This Old House magazine considered
the poster ``an extra level of editorial content.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And we don't consider it advertising,'' he said, ``and we
don't bill it as advertising.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he found the magazine society's move ``very regretful.''
He added: ``I think it is going to be deeply disappointing to our
editorial team and to our magazine, especially with so many other
more egregious examples across the industry. We look through
shelter magazines all the time who in their editorial wells we find
one brand name after another that is featured in the content and is
followed by advertising by the same guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Thorkilsen would not cite specific examples in the industry, but
he said shelter magazines were a particular category in which
advertisers expect favorable attention. ``I find it ironic that
we're the ones taking the bullet here,'' he said.

JOHN PAUL ON CD, FOR EASTER AND THE MILLENNIUM
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By   JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ First came the book, then the show, and now the
major-label compact disk.
</P>
<P>
   Pope John Paul II, whose book ``Crossing the Threshold of
Hope,'' was a best seller in 1994 and whose play, ``The Jeweler's
Shop,'' opened at St. Bart's Playhouse in Manhattan later that
year, was given a copy Wednesday of his first music CD, which is to
be released internationally by Sony Classical on March 23.
</P>
<P>
   It is not the pope's first CD. Last April, RCA Victor issued a
CD and cassette of poems by Pope John Paul, recited in Italian by
actor Vittorio Gassmann. And last summer designers at a Rome
fashion show used a CD in which the pope is heard singing a
Gregorian chant electronically melded with a hip-hop background
beat, despite Vatican threats to sue. And a double CD of the pope
reciting the rosary went platinum in Spain in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   But Pasquale Borgomeo, director of Radio Vatican, said the CD
offered Wednesday was ``the first time there has been a real
artistically integrated musical use of the pope's voice.''
</P>
<P>
   The CD, called ``Abba Pater,'' will go on sale in more than 30
countries, including the United States, where it will retail for
$16.98. A selection of prayers, chants and homilies in five
languages recorded by Radio Vatican over the last 20 years, it
includes a background of classical and easy-listening music by
Italian composers.
</P>
<P>
   While the CD's release is timed to coincide with the Easter
season, Joaquin Navarro-Valls, the papal spokesman, said it came
``in close connection with the Jubilee'' declared by the pope for
the year 2000 to mark the start of Christianity's third millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinal Roger Etchegaray, president of the Vatican's Jubilee
committee, said at a news conference that the pope's voice ``is
offered, not as a star'' but as a pastor, ``to render visible to
men, women and youth the inner pilgrimage'' that the Jubilee
outwardly represents.
</P>
<P>
   Sony is paying a distribution fee plus royalties to Vatican
Radio and the Society of St. Paul, an Italian order of priests
specializing in publishing that produced the CD, plus a video clip
for music television and a single for pop radio stations.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Gelb, president of Sony Classical, would not say how much
Sony is paying, but he said it was ``a lot less'' than the $9
million Alfred A. Knopf paid for the pope's book.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The video clip features scenes from the pope's many trips around
the world. John Paul recites or sings prayers and homilies,
including a Gregorian chant version of the Our Father. The words of
the title, ``Abba Pater,'' the Aramaic and Latin words for
``father,'' are the words spoken by Jesus in prayer in Gethsemane.
</P>
<P>
   Leonardo De Amicis, one of the composers, said the technique was
to take the papal recordings and fit the music around them. ``What
amazed us,'' he said of the pope, was that ``his rhythmic cadences
and expression helped us immensely.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly Sony is hoping to cash in on the popularity of music
like the recordings of Gregorian chant by Spanish Benedictines,
which in recent years have sold millions of copies. In an unusual
arrangement, Sony will promote the CD in cooperation with local
Catholic bishops conferences, which will share the royalties.
</P>
<P>
   Gelb said that in the United States he expected particularly
strong sales in Spanish-speaking communities in which church
leaders have designated the royalties for scholarship funds.
</P>
<P>
   Gelb declined to give a figure on Sony's promotion budget,
saying it was ``what would be typically spent for a popular record
of which you would expect to sell a million copies or more.''

 &HT;    Analysts: Jackpot from state lotteries dwindling in South
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Researchers who keep tabs on the growth industry of
state lotteries have some sobering words for states eager to cash
in:
</P>
<P>
   There's still a lot of potential loot out there, but don't count
on the huge profits snared by the early birds. And there's still
that nagging question of whether gambling serves the public good.
</P>
<P>
   Money streams into state lotteries, but slower than before. Over
the past six years, sales have flattened or declined in five of six
Southern lotteries. Only Georgia's ticket sales have increased
every year since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, says Marcy Goodfleisch, spokeswoman for the Texas
Lottery Commission, ``If you have a lottery, it will make money for
your state. Period.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas made a bundle last year even as ticket sales dropped more
than 17 percent over fiscal year 1997. Sales totaled $3 billion,
more than any state in the South, and contributed more than $1
billion to the Texas general fund.

   David Gale, executive director of the North American Association
of State and Provincial Lotteries, says there's enough money and
people in the South for everyone to generate lottery profits, even
if Alabama, South Carolina, North Carolina and Tennessee all
started their own games.
</P>
<P>
   The key elements are the South's growing population and
industry. In the Northeast, Gale said, 11 contiguous states operate
profitable games.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a cost, analysts warn.
</P>
<P>
   According to two Duke University researchers who have studied
lotteries over the last decade, states should stop the aggressive
advertising that glamorizes lottery gambling. Charles Clotfelter
and Phil Cook will discuss their findings at a two-day meeting of
the National Gambling Impact Study Commission that begins today in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Congress created the gambling commission in 1996. The group's
final report on the nation's gambling habits is due in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think the messages that are being used in advertising
are appropriate for the state government to deliver to the
public,'' Cook said. ``Thematically, it would be: Trust your luck,
play the lottery as a plan for getting ahead in life, that money
will solve your problems (and) ... look at all the lavishness that
could be part of your life if you won the big jackpot.''
</P>
<P>
   In Alabama and South Carolina, Democrats won governorships last
November over incumbent Republicans by promising lotteries for
education. The prospect of a statewide lottery also has been raised
in North Carolina and in Tennessee, where a House committee Tuesday
approved a bill calling for a constitutional convention to consider
a lottery.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia estimates that 16 of every 100 tickets sold are bought
by residents of Alabama, South Carolina, North Carolina and
Tennessee. Georgia Lottery Corp. President Rebecca Paul says
there's no way to forecast what new lotteries would do to Georgia
sales since none of the would-be lottery states have authorized or
designed their games, which may not appear for years.
</P>
<P>
   For Alabama residents, lotteries in Georgia and Florida remain
the closest thing to having their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``The longer you establish those buying patterns, the harder it
is to break those buying patterns for a new consumer product,''
Paul said. ``It's way, way too early to tell what impact lotteries
around us will have. We had virtually no impact on the Florida
lottery.''
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, which enjoyed a brief reign as the South's only
lottery state, sales dropped 2.7 percent in 1993, the first year of
Georgia's lottery, and climbed just 1.8 percent the following year.
Since 80 percent of their tickets are sold to residents, Florida
officials are confident despite potential competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that we're all that concerned with neighboring
states offering lotteries because they wouldn't be able to offer
the same size jackpots,'' said Florida lottery spokesman Tim
Bottcher.
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky lottery officials are more pessimistic. Indiana casinos
have been cutting into possible lottery sales for years. For the
first time in its 10-year history, the Kentucky lottery set an
annual sales goal that was less than actual sales the previous
year. To attract more players, the Kentucky Lottery Corp. this week
added a midday drawing for its Pick 3 and Pick 4 games.
</P>
<P>
   More worry looms as Tennessee continues a lottery debate that
has run hot and cold the past several years. Kentucky generates 15
percent of its ticket sales from Tennessee residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``If and when Tennessee starts a lottery, Kentucky will be faced
with a major revenue shortfall,'' said Rick Redman, spokesman for
the Kentucky lottery.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, the lottery started in 1992 and posted double-digit
sales gains in four of its next seven years, selling more tickets
than any game in the South. Unexpectedly, ticket sales dropped last
year nearly 18 percent. Lottery studies showed some players quit
because they perceived their odds of winning had dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the drop in sales, the Texas lottery remains very much
in the black. ``We're declining in sales, but we're not losing
money,'' Goodfleisch said. ``We're just making less.''
</P>
<P>
   While researcher Cook questions whether lotteries are a proper
way for governments to raise revenue, he concedes that the state
monopolies stand to reap continued profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might be true that Wyoming would have a hard time making
money on a lottery because the density is so low,'' said Cook.
``But I don't think that's true (in the South). They would make
some money off of it.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the $35.9 billion U.S. lottery industry has nearly
doubled sales since 1989, the last time the Duke professors
analyzed the country's lotteries. In 1989, lotteries in 29 states
plus the District of Columbia generated $18.5 billion in annual
sales. Today, there are 38 lotteries, including six in the Southern
states of Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Texas and
Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the success of lotteries, say some lottery
officials, is the type of advertising that the Duke researchers
suggest the states should abandon.
</P>
<P>
   During her testimony last year to the gambling commission,
Georgia's Paul declared, ``Lottery tickets compete with Mars candy,
Frito-Lay and Coca-Cola. When a customer buys $18 worth of gas at a
convenience store and pays with a $20 bill, I hope they'll spend
their $2 worth of change on lottery tickets to support HOPE
scholarships rather than soda or Slim Jims.

   Points on pizza
</P>
<P>
   By Kitty Crider
</P>
<P>
   c. Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Call it a moment of March Madness. But enough of
all these basketballs in the air. Let's mix it up, toss up
something else. Like pizzas.
</P>
<P>
   Haven't you wondered how hard it really is to throw a disc of
dough in the air and have it come back down in one piece, in your
hands, not on the floor?
</P>
<P>
   Well, pizza dough is floppier to throw than a Frisbee or a
basketball, that's for sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's just dough. And you can't hurt it,'' reassures Brian
Smith, owner of DoubleDave's, who has taught many a novice to toss
a pizza.
</P>
<P>
   One day last week this pizza coach gave a quick lesson to some
basketball players recruited to try their hands at throwing
something besides orange balls. You don't have to be an athlete to
master the pizza layup, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very uncoordinated. I was horrible,'' confessed Smith,
who now can pat, roll, toss and build a pizza in an impressive 45
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Your goal, explains Smith, is not a slam dunk. It's not height.
It's centrifugal force to shape and stretch the dough. And, yeah,
it's a lot for show, too.
</P>
<P>
   While some pizza makers may shape the dough almost exclusively
by tossing it, Smith prefers to pat and roll it before giving it a
couple of flings in the air. (For DoubleDave's famous Peproni
Rolls, he throws the dough even longer and larger.)
</P>
<P>
   Smith says the secret is not to roll the dough too thin in the
center but more around the edges, working in a circle so you don't
end up with a square. ``Thickness doesn't matter but you don't want
to see light through the dough,'' says Smith, deftly wielding a
rolling pin the jocks estimated at five pounds.
</P>
<P>
   When the dough is about 15 inches, he spins the floury circle,
tossing it a foot or two in the air before catching it on his hand
and settling it in a pizza pan. Gee, it looks easy.
</P>
<P>
   But now, it's Django Walker's turn. No. 45, senior, power
forward for Austin High, Walker steps up to the kitchen goal line.
He sprinkles flour on the counter, he pats out the dough, he rolls,
he throws. . . . It's up. It's spinning. It comes back down. On his
hand. In one piece. He smiles and tosses it again. Nothing to it.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure's on for Nic Dukes, No. 12, senior point guard for
Westwood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do what now?'' he asks as he grabs a dough ball and starts
working with it, sprinkling flour and flopping it around like a
pro. Wait a minute, Nic. This isn't the first time you've handled
dough. Do you work in a pizza shop? Nope, he grins. But he's made
pizza at home, with store-bought dough. He goes through the pizza
warm-up and throws. It swirls. Perfectly. And again.
</P>
<P>
   Man, these guys are hitting 100 percent. Must be that great hand
coordination. Or a good pizza coach. Or they are hungry.
</P>
<P>
   Smith shows them how to finish up the dough for pizzas and
Peproni Rolls.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the hardest part,'' says Walker, trying to spread the
sauce evenly on the pizza crust. Easy for him to say.
</P>
<P>
   Dukes, meanwhile, is fine-tuning his Peproni Rolls technique.
When he's got it, he turns and invites Smith to his new place:
DomiNic's.
</P>
<P>
   HOW TO TOSS A PIZZA
</P>
<P>
   DoubleDave's starts with dough straight from the mixer without
letting it rise. (If the dough is allowed to rise, it becomes
softer and tears more easily when tossed. Dough also tears more
easily on a humid day.)
</P>
<P>
   Some DoubleDave's locations (including Smith's) will sell dough
balls for you to take home and make your own pizzas or Peproni
Rolls. If you need a large order, like 20 or more, call ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Take a ball of dough (about 19 ounces for a 15-inch pizza) and
on a floured surface, pat it into a circle, working out the air
with the tips of fingers like a kitten making a bed with its paws.
Sprinkle flour on dough top to keep from sticking.
</P>
<P>
   With a heavy rolling pin (about 3 to 5 pounds), use about half
of the pin to roll or push the edges of the dough away from the
center. Flour rolling pin as needed to keep from sticking. Turn
dough as you work, to maintain a circle shape. Do not slam down pin
and roll across the dough, or the center will be too thin.
(Thickness of dough does not matter particularly, but you do not
want to be able to see through it.)
</P>
<P>
   Roll dough to size of finished pizza, 15 inches, for example.
(Tip: Hold pizza pan over dough so you can gauge the right size.)
</P>
<P>
   Pick up the dough and drape it over one fist close to the edge.
Using other hand, give about a half circle spin, releasing dough.
Do not try to go too high. Catch the dough with both hands and spin
again. (If it falls on the floor, throw away. If it tears, try to
patch it by overlapping the dough or adding a small new piece of
dough.)
</P>
<P>
   Place dough on ungreased pizza pan. Dough should overlap edge
about 3/4 inch. Fold under the overlap and pinch to form pizza
edge. (You do not want to see the metal edge of the pan.)
</P>
<P>
   Brush pizza edge with melted garlic butter made with 1/2 stick
of butter and a scant teaspoon each garlic powder and oregano.
</P>
<P>
   Ladle 1/2 cup pizza sauce in center of pizza and spread evenly
with a large spoon.
</P>
<P>
   Sprinkle on 6 ounces of shredded mozzarella cheese all the way
to edge of pizza.
</P>
<P>
   Top pizza as desired. If using pepperoni, put slices close
together but do not overlap or pizza will be too greasy.
</P>
<P>
   Do not put topping ingredient in very center of pizza, as it
will be decimated when it is sliced 8 times.
</P>
<P>
   Bake pizza at 450 degrees until done, about 15-20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   DOUBLEDAVE'S SPECIALTY: PEPRONI ROLLS
</P>
<P>
   DoubleDave's is famous for these rolls, made with pizza dough
and filled with smoked provolone cheese and pepperoni slices.
</P>
<P>
   Start with about a 19-ounce ball of pizza dough and prepare as
for pizza, except roll or toss to 22-inch diameter. (It is harder
to toss to 22 inches than to a 15-inch pizza. Use a rolling pin as
needed.)
</P>
<P>
   Take 4 round 1-ounce slices of smoked provolone cheese and cut
in half. Place the half-circles of cheese around the edge of dough.
</P>
<P>
   Place 6 overlapping slices of pepperoni on top of cheese.
</P>
<P>
   With a pizza cutter or knife, cut dough into 8 wedges, between
the cheese slices.
</P>
<P>
   Fold in the two edges of the top of the wedge over the cheese.
Then, folding cheese in half, roll up tightly, stretching dough and
rolling toward point, like a crescent roll. Repeat with remaining
wedges.
</P>
<P>
   If desired, bend roll into an angle for an attractive
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Bake until done at 450 degrees for 15-20 minutes. Makes 8
Peproni Rolls. Serve with marinara sauce or ranch dressing.
</P>
<P>
   Note: For the closest match to the real thing, start with a
dough ball purchased from DoubleDave's. In fact, they have
customers who come in and buy the dough, cheese and pepperoni and
go home and make the rolls.
</P>
<P>
   BREAD MACHINE PIZZA DOUGH
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup water
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   2 cups flour, all purpose or bread
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 teaspoons fast-rise yeast
</P>
<P>
   Add lukewarm water and vegetable oil to pan of bread machine.
Add flour, sugar and salt to pan. Make a well in center of dry
ingredients, add yeast. Lock pan into bread maker. Program for
dough. When dough is well mixed and kneaded, it can be shaped for
pizza or allowed to rise, then kneaded down. Let rest about 10
minutes and then roll, pat or toss dough to fit an ungreased 14 to
15 inch pizza pan, which has been sprinkled with corn meal.
</P>
<P>
   To make pizza: top dough with 1/2 to 3/4 cup pizza sauce,
shredded mozzarella cheese, and meats or veggies of choice. Bake at
450 degrees 15-20 minutes or until done.
</P>
<P>
   QUICK TOMATO PIZZA SAUCE
</P>
<P>
   1 to 2 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 can (8 to 10 ounces) tomato puree or tomato sauce
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup tomato paste
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon dried basil
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons dried oregano
</P>
<P>
   Several grindings of black pepper
</P>
<P>
   Over low heat, saute garlic in olive oil until garlic is
softened but not brown. Add remaining ingredients and stir to
combine. Simmer, covered, over very low heat for 15 minutes. Makes
1 cup. _ ``32 Zesty Pizzas'' by Bev Bennett and
</P>
<P>
   KIM UPTON BASIC PIZZA DOUGH
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 cup warm (110 degrees to 115 degrees) water
</P>
<P>
   1 envelope ( 1/4 ounce) active dry yeast
</P>
<P>
   3 1/4 cups bread, semolina, or unbleached all-purpose flour, or
a combination
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   This basic dough can be used for any type of pizza: traditional
or contemporary; flat or deep-dish; topped, stuffed, or folded. The
recipe can be doubled if you're entertaining a crowd or just want
to prepare extra dough for freezing.
</P>
<P>
   In a small bowl, dissolve the sugar in warm tap water that
registers 110 degrees to 115 degrees. For temperature accuracy,
insert an instant-read thermometer in the water. Alternatively,
learn to judge by touch; the water should be warm to your finger
but not too hot _ the temperature of a comfortable bath. Water that
is too hot will kill the yeast, while water that is too cold will
not activate it.
</P>
<P>
   Sprinkle the yeast over the water and stir gently until it
dissolves, about 1 minute. When yeast is mixed with the water at
the proper temperature, a smooth, beige-colored mixture results.
(If the yeast clumps together and the water stays clear, discard
the mixture and start over). Let stand in a warm spot until a thin
layer of foam covers the surface, about 5 minutes, indicating that
the yeast is effective. (Discard mixture and start over with a
fresh package of yeast if bubbles have not formed within 5
minutes.)
</P>
<P>
   To mix and knead the dough by hand: Combine 3 cups of the flour
with the salt in a mixing bowl. Make a well in the center of the
flour and pour in the yeast mixture and the oil, if using. Using a
wooden spoon, vigorously stir the flour into the well, beginning in
the center and working toward the sides of the bowl, until the
flour is incorporated and the soft dough just begins to hold
together.
</P>
<P>
   Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Dust your
hands with flour and knead the dough gently in the following
manner: press down on the dough with the heels of your hands and
push it away from you, then partially fold it back over itself.
Shift it a quarter turn and repeat the procedure. While kneading,
very gradually add just enough of the remaining 1/4 cup flour until
the dough is no longer sticky or tacky; this should take about 5
minutes. As you work, use a metal dough scraper to pry up any bits
of dough that stick to the work surface. Continue kneading until
the dough is smooth, elastic and shiny, 10 to 15 minutes longer.
Knead the dough only until it feels smooth and springy; too much
kneading results in a tough crust.
</P>
<P>
   To mix and knead the dough in a heavy-duty food processor: Add 3
cups of the flour and the salt to the beaker fitted with either a
steel blade or a dough hook. Turn the machine on to combine the
ingredients, about 5 seconds. Add the yeast mixture and oil, if
using, and process continuously until the dough forms a single ball
or several masses on top of the blade, about 30 seconds. Pinch off
a piece of dough and feel it. If it is sticky, continue processing
while gradually adding just enough of the remaining 1/4 cup flour
for the dough to lose its stickiness. If the dough is dry and
crumbly, add warm water, a tablespoon at a time, until the dough is
smooth. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead
by hand as described above for about 2 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   If freezing Wrap tightly in plastic wrap or seal in airtight
plastic containers and freeze for up to 4 months. Before using,
thaw in the refrigerator for 1 or 2 days or for a few hours at room
temperature.
</P>
<P>
   Shape the dough into circles.
</P>
<P>
   Top dough as desired.
</P>
<P>
   For the crispiest crust, bake flat pizzas directly on a baking
surface formed of unglazed quarry tiles or on a baking stone. In a
gas oven, position the tiles or stone directly on the oven floor.
In an electric stove, arrange the tiles or stone on the lowest rack
of the oven. When using tiles, leave a 1-inch clearance between the
tiles and the oven walls. Preheat the oven at 500 degrees for 1
hour before assembling the pizza. Bake until the crust is golden or
as directed in individual recipes, usually about 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   To bake on a pizza screen, brush the wire screen lightly with
vegetable oil and top with the shaped dough. Assemble the pizza as
quickly as possible and give the screen a quick jerk to be sure the
dough is not stuck to the wire. Place the screen directly on the
hot tiles or pizza stone. If you choose not to use tiles or a
stone, place the screen on the top rack of a preheated 500-degree
oven to prevent the direct heat from burning the bottom crust. Bake
until the crust is golden or as directed in individual recipes,
usually about 10 minutes on tiles or a stone and about 15 minutes
on an oven rack. _ ``Pizza'' by James McNair

 &HT;    Savannah parade pulls out the stops for St. Pat's
 &HT;    By Jingle Davis
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAVANNAH, Ga. _ The 300,000-plus people who turned out to watch
this old city's 175th annual St. Patrick's Day parade _ billed as
the nation's second-largest _ were often just as colorful and
entertaining as the parade itself.
</P>
<P>
   Two white-haired women lounging in deck chairs along the parade
route proudly waved a sign reading, ``two old foxes wearing green
soxes.''
</P>
<P>
   Green hair was commonplace, but one red-haired spectator with a
brilliant green beard stood out from the crowd. A small black
poodle wore a green and white garter around its middle as a frilly
tutu.
</P>
<P>
   Shamrocks showed up in every guise imaginable _ as pins,
earrings, hair ornaments, beads, and on every article of clothing:
T-shirts, neckties, hats, balloons and sunglasses. The parade wound
through downtown, with marching bands, kilted bagpipers, floats,
Irish families, dignitaries, Irish dancers, military units, little
kids in decorated wagons and babies in beribboned carriages, all
curving around the picturesque parks where red and pink azaleas
flamed against the moving sea of green.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's beautiful! Beautiful! Out of this world!'' raved Emolo
Garosi, a retiree from Hershey, Penn., who was in town visiting his
son, a helicopter pilot at Hunter Army Airfield.
</P>
<P>
   Officials praised a new policy requiring people to pass through
entrance gates and buy $4 wristbands in order to drink alcohol
outdoors on River Street, where much rowdy behavior has occurred in
the past. The gates went up Friday night, stayed up through Sunday
night and were up against Tuesday and Wednesday for pre- and
post-parade partying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arrests dropped 65 percent this year over last,'' said Bucky
Burnsed, spokesman for the Savannah police. ``We are seeing a
kinder, gentler crowd.''
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of the citations issued were for disorderly conduct,
public indecency _ including public urination and trading Mardi
Gras-style beads for displays of nudity _ and underage drinking, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon Varnedoe, executive director of the Savannah Waterfront
Association, said he believes most merchants, even those who
initially opposed the wristbands, were pleased with this year's
event, both in terms of sales and the reduction of problems on
River Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely think we will do this again,'' he said.

 &HT;    Study: Dirty air will continue to plague Georgia without laws to
limit SUV emissions
 &HT;    By David Goldberg
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Sport utility vehicles, which emit up to three times
the pollution and burn a third more gas than smaller cars, are so
popular in Georgia that the state will have a hard time achieving
clean air without proposed tighter standards on the vehicles, a
report concludes. The report, issued Wednesday by the U.S. Public
Interest Research Group, analyzed the likely effects of the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency's proposal to adopt standards for
SUVs, vans and pickups.
</P>
<P>
   The study looked ahead 20 years and found, apart from
California, only New York, Texas, Florida, Ohio and Michigan would
have greater reductions than Georgia in nitrogen oxides, the
pollutants that trigger ozone smog formation, if stricter controls
are implemented. Georgia could avoid breathing 44,285 tons of
nitrogen oxides, according to the report, dubbed ``Big Cars, Dirty
Air.''
</P>
<P>
   With more people driving the heavier, higher-polluting vehicles
more miles each year, metro Atlanta and other areas might never be
able to meet federal clean-air standards without tighter
strictures, said Robert Pregulman, Southern field director for U.S.
PIRG.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is time automakers clean up SUVs and make them follow the
same pollution rules as cars,'' Pregulman said. For many years,
SUVs and light trucks were considered work vehicles, and their
heavier engines were allowed to meet less stringent emissions
levels than passenger cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``While Gov. (Roy) Barnes' plan to rethink development is great,
this is something that can happen quickly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA's proposed rules, now under evaluation by the White
House, envision making automakers meet the same, tighter standards
being imposed on smaller cars. But the EPA has indicated
manufacturers would have until 2007 to meet them for SUVs and
trucks under 6,000 pounds, and an additional two years for larger
vehicles, such as Ford's new Excursion, that weigh up to 8,500.

   The EPA also is expected to call for cleaner-burning, low-sulfur
gasoline, which is required in California, to be sold nationwide.
About a third of the vehicles in metro Atlanta are SUVs, pickups or
vans, but the share is growing rapidly. In 1998, five of the 10
best-selling vehicles in the nation were in that category.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA's proposed rules have been developed in consultation
with automakers, said Helen Petrauskas, vice president for
environmental engineering at Ford Motor Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only does Ford share a desire to improve the nation's air
quality,'' she said in a statement, ``(the company) ... is making
every one of its sport utilities and its highest-volume minivan
low-emission vehicles.

SOME SEE CHAFEE ANNOUNCEMENT AS CUE FOR REP. KENNEDY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ He has said ``no.'' He has said ``absolutely not.''
</P>
<P>
   But in an environment where parsing words is considered sport,
it should be no surprise that Representative Patrick J. Kennedy's
pledge not to run for the Senate has come under scrutiny. And
because he comes from a family that has sent three legends into the
Senate chamber, it should be no surprise that he is under
increasing pressure to change his mind.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, despite Kennedy's insistence over a three-month period
that he will stay planted in the House, there remains a conviction
among many of his colleagues that he should start campaigning now
for the Rhode Island seat that has been held by a Republican for 24
years. That whisper campaign has crescendoed since Monday, when
Senator John H. Chafee, a Republican, announced plans to retire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just said to Patrick, `I think you're crazy,' '' said
Representative J. Joseph Moakley, a Massachusetts Democrat, who has
worked closely with Kennedy since his arrival in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be another 24 years before there's an open seat,''
agreed Senator Jack Reed, the Democrat from Rhode Island. ``He's an
obvious person people would want to think about having run for the
Senate, especially at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy made his decision not to run last fall, when Minority
Leader Richard Gephardt tapped him to become chairman of the
Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, an influential
position from which he will help shape all the House races in 2000.
This election will be even more rigorous than most; with only a
six-seat margin, and after Republican losses last fall, Gephardt is
determined to see Democrats regain the majority in the House.
</P>
<P>
   For Kennedy, that responsibility is reason enough not to bail
out. But he has other reasons, too. At age 31, he can afford to
wait two decades to decide to run for another seat _ and carve his
own niche of the Kennedy legend out of another part of Washington
in the meantime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having watched my father in the US Senate, I know what it's
about. I know the pace of it. I know the profile of a senator and
what their general disposition is, and the way they conduct
themselves as US senators,'' Kennedy said Wednesday, referring to
his father, Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts. ``And I
know the hurly-burly of the House. I feel like I'm more suited to
the House and the character of this place.''
</P>
<P>
   That logic is mystifying to many outsiders, however, and has
prompted not only forceful prodding from many Democrats but sharp
criticism from Republicans as well _ particularly when it comes to
Kennedy's aspirations for higher leadership in the House. Some
members of the GOP see Kennedy's resoluteness against running as
``putting a happy face on a really bad political decision,''
according to Chafee spokesman Nicholas Graham.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Kennedy has the impression that if Democrats take back
the House, he's got it made, he'll be Speaker in 10 years,'' he
said. ``I don't think that's the case. I think he's taking a lot
for granted...The path to higher office in the House is riddled
with more chutes than ladders.''
</P>
<P>
   Poll numbers are tantalizing as well, according to Darrell West,
professor of political science at Brown University, who has
conducted many Rhode Island polls for Chafee. If the Senate race
were split among three candidates, as many expect it to be _ with
Senator Chafee's son, Lincoln, on the Republican ticket, and
Providence Mayor Buddy Cianci running as an Independent _ Kennedy
would have an easy slide to victory, West said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm surprised he doesn't reconsider and think about running,''
West said. ``Basically, the Senate will disappear as an option for
two, three decades.''
</P>
<P>
   Senator Kennedy, who some three decades ago served in the Senate
alongside his brother, Robert, said simply that he will ``respect
Patrick's decision.'' The younger Kennedy also said his father _
and his entire family _ have stayed out of the debate, both in
public and in private.
</P>
<P>
   The outside speculation has taken its toll, however. Though
Kennedy says he is fully ``comfortable with the decision'' and
``very honored'' that so many people think he would make a viable
candidate, he also seems to wish the speculation would stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this town, it's inconceivable to anybody that if they had
the opportunity I have now that they wouldn't take it,'' he said.
``It's pretty heady stuff, and it's exciting. But even good things
can be stressful, sometimes.''

 &HT;    Court ruling thrills Georgia's black colleges
 &HT;    By Bill Rankin and Ernie Suggs
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A federal judge in Savannah has handed the state's
three historically black public universities a major court victory
by dismissing claims brought by plaintiffs who accused the schools
of providing a second-class education and being unconstitutionally
segregated.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge B. Avant Edenfield said the four plaintiffs
who raised those claims lacked standing to file suit against the
historically black colleges and universities.
</P>
<P>
   ``While all of the named plaintiffs are to some degree involved
with Georgia's public education system, none have alleged that they
were directly injured by the Board of Regents' alleged
wrongdoing,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Edenfield's order addressed only half of a major lawsuit filed
two years ago against the state university system. In January, the
judge ruled that a racial dual-track admission policy at the
University of Georgia in 1995 led to the illegal rejection of a
white applicant and allowed this student's claims to proceed.
Edenfield is still considering whether to allow similar reverse
discrimination claims raised by another white student denied
admission in 1997 under UGA's revised admission policy.
</P>
<P>
   While Edenfield did not address the merits of the claims raised
against the HBCUs, his ruling had school officials turning
cartwheels.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew there was no basis to his claim,'' said Linda Hall,
vice president for university advancement at Fort Valley State
University. ``Our institutions are open to everyone. We don't and
have never kept anybody out.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall also defended the role of black colleges and denounced
claims in the lawsuit that they were second-rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We find that very offensive,'' she said. If Edenfield had
ruled that the four plaintiffs could pursue the claims against the
HBCUs, the regents would have been forced to defend the racial
composition of the schools and show that they deliver adequate
educational opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Black student enrollment at each of the three HBCUs _ Albany
State, Fort Valley State and Savannah State _ exceeds 91 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Adams, one of the plaintiffs' lawyers, said her office is
considering whether to file an appeal or ask Edenfield to
reconsider his decision. Adams would not comment as to whether her
firm will try to bring new plaintiffs into the case against the
HBCUs.

OCEAN SALMON OPENER A BUST, AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRETT PAULY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OXNARD, Calif. _ The party boat skipper smartly summed up
Saturday's lousy first day of ocean salmon fishing in Southern
California.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's opening day for the fishermen, not for the fish,'' said
Paul Rich, captain of the Ellie-M out of Gold Coast Sportfishing in
Channel Islands Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   And the fish just weren't around. Just like last year, not a
single king, or chinook salmon was taken between the half dozen
landings that represent the sport-fishing fleet in Ventura and
Santa Barbara counties. Radio chatter suggested only a couple of
undersize salmon were caught by the numerous private vessels that
motored out under blue skies.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the anglers who choose to make the salmon
opener a tradition, the results are usually similar. It's salmon or
bust, and most often it's bust.
</P>
<P>
   Are we gluttons for punishment?
</P>
<P>
   Probably not.
</P>
<P>
   More likely, we're still chasing the dream that was the salmon
season of 1995, when anyone who could handle a line often came home
with two-fish limits. The sport-caught yield south of Santa Cruz
for that year was greater than the combined catch total for the
three seasons since; 1995's tally was more than five times greater
than the top season high over the preceding 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``'95 spoiled everybody,'' said Oxnard angler Mike Kover, who
caught 38 kings in weekly outings that year, eight in one day
alone. ``One angler came up to me and said, `You have to sit down,'
because I caught my limit that day. I went on to boat six more, and
doled them out to those who didn't catch any. By the end of the
day, that guy was begging me for one of the fish.''
</P>
<P>
   But even the opening day of the 1995 season wasn't great,
offering little insight into the miracle to come. Since salmon are
a rare exception to ocean species in that they have a regulated
season _ from the Saturday nearest March 15 to usually early
September, or whenever federal officials choose to close the season
_ it is difficult to forecast the outcome of the season, let alone
the success of the opener. No one can legally target salmon before
opening day so little information is available before then.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a crapshoot with salmon, that's just it,'' said Kover.
``If they are in here, you are going to catch them; if they're not,
you're not.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a stark contrast to predicting whether trout _ the
foremost freshwater fish with a regulated fishing season _ will
bite.
</P>
<P>
   ``With trout, most of them are stocked, so as soon as you put
them in they are caught out that weekend,'' Kover explained.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon anglers must hark back to 1997 for decent opening-day
takes of kings, with their distinctive black gums. (Coho, or silver
salmon have white gums; a threatened species in California, coho
are unlawful to keep.) That's when more than a third of the salmon
anglers aboard sport-fishing charters from Port Hueneme to Santa
Barbara returned to port with a king in the gunnysacks. It was a
standard rarely matched before _ and certainly not since _ in the
region south of Point Conception not known for having productive
salmon openers.
</P>
<P>
   But, as Rich pointed out, there is frequently a positive from
even the most negative salmon opener.
</P>
<P>
   ``After today I'll have a little more to tell the guys in the
morning,'' said Rich, who in his nine years skippering rarely
targeted salmon at all before 1995, which was to Southland salmon
fishing what ``A River Runs Through It'' was to fly-fishing. ``They
aren't quite going through here yet; hopefully it will get a little
bit better here as the season goes on.''
</P>
<P>
   Openers also draw anglers because they explore the unknown...
and a shot at chasing something special like what 1995 held.
``Today you at least had a chance; you don't have a chance
tomorrow,'' said Rich, who maintains it might well be another 20
years before a salmon bite is as wide open as '95.
</P>
<P>
   Water temperatures were ideal _ 54 to 55 degrees _ for the
cold-water-loving kings, there was plenty of bait swimming around
and the brine was discolored, which salmon prefer, it is thought,
to better sneak up on their prey undetected. But no bites.
</P>
<P>
   The luck was only slightly better up north, where just six kings
were boated Saturday by 122 anglers in Morro Bay and 51 fish for
407 anglers in Santa Cruz, according to Department of Fish and Game
reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally it's a fish per rod (to the north) once the season
has gotten going,'' said Matt Erickson, a marine biologist for the
DFG's Ocean Salmon Project in Healdsburg.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we're not real big into predicting,'' Erickson said of the
largely unpredictable salmon. ``It's bad enough to go fishing on
your own and predict how you are going to do, let alone predict for
the entire state.''
</P>
<P>
   But for all the uncertainties leading up to it and Saturday's
terrible results, many anglers felt they were still better off.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing about today,'' said salmon-opener regular Chuck
Littlewood of Rancho Cucamonga, ``the telephone didn't ring one
time, and that's very important.'' &QL;

IOC OUTS SIX FOR TAKING PAYOFFS FROM SALT LAKE CITY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAUSANNE, Switzerland _ The International Olympic Committee
began its radical makeover with an unprecedented purge Wednesday,
expelling six members who took improper payoffs from the Salt Lake
City bidders for the 2002 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   The expulsions came on the heels of a rousing vote of confidence
for the embattled IOC president, Juan Antonio Samaranch, who has
weathered months of calls for his resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday the IOC is expected to follow through on the rest of
the changes it promised in the wake of the worst scandal in its
105-year history: allowing members to vote for future host cities
only after a smaller selection group has picked two finalists;
creating an independent ethics commission to oversee members'
behavior; and setting up a study group of two dozen people, half of
them prominent outsiders, to reform by year's end everything from
how the IOC chooses its members to how it distributes its money.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC has been under strong pressure from corporate sponsors
and political leaders to right itself in the aftermath of the Salt
Lake scandal, in which organizers were found to have plied IOC
members with some $1.2 million worth of gifts, cash, travel,
scholarships, medical care, and other inducements.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're starting to deliver on what we've said we would from the
beginning of the crisis,'' said IOC vice president Richard Pound of
Canada, who chaired the investigative panel that recommended the
expulsions. ``We will put our own house in order and respond to the
concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   The first step was Wednesday's purge. The IOC, which had not
ousted a member in 37 years, voted by secret ballot to dismiss
Jean-Claude Ganga of the Congo, Zein El Abdin Ahmed Abdel Gadir of
Sudan, Sergio Santander Fantini of Chile, Agustin Arroyo of
Ecuador, Lamine Keita of Mali, and Seiuli Paul Wallwork of Western
Samoa. Four other members _ Bashir Mohamed Attarabulsi of Libya,
Pirjo Haggman of Finland, Charles Mukora of Kenya, and David
Sibandze of Swaziland _ had already resigned.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch, the IOC president since 1980, received an 86-2 vote
of confidence, with two incomplete ballots among the 90 members
voting by secret ballot.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is the best person to see us through this crisis,'' said US
member Anita DeFrantz, of the 78-year-old Samaranch.
</P>
<P>
   Calling this the IOC's most important meeting ever, Samaranch
opened the session with a frank and somber speech urging the
members to expel the wrongdoers and approve the reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is my firm conviction that unless we act quickly,
decisively, and unanimously at this extraordinary session,''
Samaranch said, ``the damage which may be done to the Olympic
movement and to the IOC as a result of the recent disclosures will
be very, very serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch said he accepted responsibility for the Salt Lake
scandal ``even if some of the conduct by bidding cities has itself
been unethical.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the IOC that is being judged, and the IOC that must deal
with the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch said he wanted to lead the IOC through its period of
crisis and the implementation of reforms, but he signaled that he
might not serve out his entire term, which expires in 2001. ``I
have personally given the best of myself to the Olympic movement
over the last 18 years and. . . . my last service to Olympism would
be to structure our organization in order to enter the new
millennium stronger than ever,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not since 1962, when Saul Cristavao Ferreira Pires of Portugal
was thrown out for allowing his family's expenses to be paid to the
1960 Summer Olympics, had the IOC expelled one of its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one in the room had gone through the expulsion of a
member,'' said Craig Reedie of Great Britain. ``People were
uncomfortable with the fact that they had to be doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet had the six not been expelled, members said, the IOC would
have been widely seen as incapable of policing itself and the
executive board, which was unanimous for expulsion, would have
stepped down in protest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all would have resigned,'' said Jacques Rogge of Belgium.
``That is for certain.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the six members were excluded from voting, each was given
20 minutes to defend himself before the full body, which considered
the issue behind closed doors for five hours. ``They all came, they
were all eloquent, and they all did their best to explain why they
should not be expelled,'' said DeFrantz.
</P>
<P>
   But all six were dismissed by more than the required two-thirds
margin. The vote against Ganga, who allegedly took more than a
quarter-million dollars in payoffs and gifts for himself and his
family, was 88-2. The only remotely close vote was for Wallwork,
who denied knowing that his wife had solicited a $30,000 loan from
former Salt Lake bid chief Tom Welch. The vote against Wallwork was
67-19.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who have been expelled today, I do not plead for them at
all,'' said Hein Verbruggen of the Netherlands, whose countryman,
Anthonius Geesink, earlier had received a warning after Salt Lake
committee members contributed $5,000 to a foundation in his name.
</P>
<P>
   Some members were said to be annoyed that the six hadn't
resigned earlier and spared their colleagues the distasteful duty
of drumming them out. But the prevailing mood in the meeting room
at the Palais de Beaulieu, said Rogge, was ``dignified sadness.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I hated every second of it,'' he added. ``I hated the last
three months of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The scandal has turned the august IOC inside out and set
colleague against colleague. At Tuesday's board meeting, director
general Francois Carrard and Kim Un-yong of South Korea, who has
been censured and is still under investigation for his role in the
Salt Lake scandal, squared off in a shouting match that nearly came
to blows when the 67-year-old Kim, who heads the world taekwondo
federation, struck a menacing martial arts pose that sent Carrard
fleeing.
</P>
<P>
   ``A minor incident,'' Carrard said Wednesday. ``I'm physically
fine.''
</P>
<P>
   The tensions, building since December, finally achieved
catharsis in the most public and painful day the Lords of the Rings
had ever endured.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're reaching the end of the beginning,'' said Pound. ``It
was painful, but if we hadn't done it, it would have been difficult
to move on. It would be something on our back all the time.''

WAR PREPARATION INTENSIFIES AS KOSOVO TALKS FALTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUDAPEST _ Talks to end the fighting in Kosovo came close to
ending in failure Wednesday, with international mediators in Paris
complaining that the Serbs are refusing to discuss the deployment
of 30,000 NATO troops to patrol the troubled province.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Yugoslav army moved thousands of troops
closer to Kosovo, fearing a possible NATO attack.
</P>
<P>
   The war preparations also came as European Union forensic
experts issued a report saying that dozens of ethnic Kosovo
Albanians slain in January appeared to be civilians, not
combatants.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Yugoslav side has chosen not to engage on the
implementation side,'' US mediator Chris Hill told reporters in
Paris. He said the Albanians will sign the agreement ``before the
(peace) conference ends,'' which will be ``very shortly,'' implying
that the talks are nearly finished.
</P>
<P>
   The Albanian signature is key because it would put extra
pressure on the Serbs to sign the pact as well. The possibility of
a punitive NATO strike against the Yugoslav republic of Serbia _
which the United States has threatened several times, but not
executed - would also be heightened after the Albanians ink the
document.
</P>
<P>
   US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has said that NATO
would not strike if both sides failed to sign, but might do so if
only the Serbs refused.
</P>
<P>
   The US and European Union mediators were clearly losing patience
Wednesday with the Serbs, whom EU mediator Wolfgang Petritsch said
held ``the larger part of the responsibility'' for the lack of
progress.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian mediator, Boris Maiorsky, was less pessimistic. ``As
long as there is time and there is hope, we will continue
working,'' said Maiorsky, whose nation has traditionally had closer
ties with the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Serbs and ethnic Albanians are fighting over control of Kosovo,
a southern Serbian province largely inhabited by Albanians. The
Western-crafted peace pact would give the Kosovars political
autonomy for three years, with a possibility of independence from
Serbia later.
</P>
<P>
   On the ground, the situation looked bleak. Yugoslav army troops
set up anti-aircraft missiles in the mountains northwest of
Kosovo's capital, Pristina, rebel leader Suleiman Selimi said
Wednesday in his first interview since being appointed supreme
commander of the Kosovo Liberation Army last month.
</P>
<P>
   Senior officials with the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe said the missiles could be the Yugoslav
version of a heat-seeking, Soviet-built short-range missile that
monitors have seen on regional roads.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting near Prizren, in southern Kosovo, forced 1,500 people
to flee into the mountains, a spokesman for the Organization on
Security and Cooperation in Europe's verification mission said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the forensics expert assigned to examine perhaps the
ugliest episode in the year-long battle -- the murder of 45,
civilian-clothed Albanians in January -- Wednesday called the deed
a ``crime against humanity,'' and said the victims were unarmed.

<P>
   The Finnish forensic scientist, Helena Ranta, declined to term
the murders a ``massacre,'' but when pressed, she said it appeared
that there had not been an exchange of gunfire before the Racak
residents were killed.

   The Serbs have insisted that the dead -- found dumped in a Racak
hillside -- were killed during a firefight between Serbs and the
rogue Kosovo Liberation Army.

   The gruesome murders drew international horror, and sparked
peace talks in Rambouillet, France in February.

ICE A MERE MEMORY AT LAKES

<P>
   JUNE LAKE, Calif. _ Anglers can expect better access to fishing
holes and campgrounds and more active fish when this year's Eastern
Sierra trout season rolls around April 24.
</P>
<P>
   The region's three ``biggies'' _ Crowley, Convict and June
lakes, the most popular major roadside fishing attractions _ are
already free of ice, and crews are a month ahead of schedule in
readying docks, gas pumps and campgrounds for business.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all a lot different than last year,'' said John
Frederickson, who operates June Lake Marina and Crowley Lake Fish
Camp. ``This year it's just completely turned around.''
</P>
<P>
   Frederickson won't soon forget last year's ``nightmare,'' when
the ice on Crowley Lake was unusually thick. Fishermen were unsure
as to whether they could launch boats because the ice didn't thaw
until two days before the Saturday opener. Ice-covered Convict Lake
was closed to the general public for the opening.
</P>
<P>
   But 1998 seemed a distant memory as Frederickson enjoyed
Wednesday's sunny skies and warm temperatures at June Lake, where
patchy ice broke loose three weeks ago in 80 mph winds. Crowley has
been ice-free since March 3. Convict is clear, too, as are all
remaining waters in the June Lake Loop, Bridgeport Reservoir and
nearby Twin Lakes, according to Department of Fish and Game
officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the public, they have more opportunities to go to more
lakes,'' said Al Zamudio, a game warden for the Mammoth Lakes,
which, to no one's great surprise, are still laden with ice. ``It
will be more dispersed, which means popular sites will be less
crowded. Some years, people come and, unless they have snowmobiles,
can only get into Crowley.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should be a really good opener.''
</P>
<P>
   The fishing also should be better; DFG statistics show that
opening-day catch rates improve at Crowley the earlier the lake
thaws.

SPORTS COLUMN:   SAMARANCH'S TROUBLES CAN ONLY GET WORSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (With OLY-SCANDAL)  
(rk) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ This was the easy part, expelling six delegates whose
arms had been caught elbow-deep in the goody bag. The hard part
will be wiping the smirk off people's faces when they talk about
the International Olympic Committee. And they will talk.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the overwhelming 86-2 vote of confidence Juan Antonio
Samaranch received Wednesday in Switzerland, he is now a lame duck
doomed to waddle through his final two years as the president of
this damaged organization. Americans can surely relate to that.
</P>
<P>
   It would have been better if somebody could have persuaded
Samaranch it was time to leave, but he had enough support from his
cadre of hand-picked delegates to enable himself to survive, at
least for the moment. The question is whether association with
Samaranch will taint the visible younger leaders like Richard Pound
of Canada, Anita DeFrantz of the United States and Kevan Gosper of
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   They really have no alternative but to appear loyal to His
Excellency and the system, which is about to be poked and prodded
by irreverent waves of sponsors and news media and American
congressional committee members.
</P>
<P>
   Fevered imagination says it could yet come down to Strom
Thurmond interrogating Juan Antonio Samaranch, live on C-Span:
``Now Senor Samaranch, could you describe for us poor backwards
Americans this-here chateau you folks use in Switzerland?''
</P>
<P>
   Even if that scenario doesn't come true, people will titter
about the IOC and Juan Antonio Samaranch the way they will titter
about President Clinton for the rest of his term. Salt Lake City
was His Excellency's own personal Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   He talked a good game Wednesday, saying, ``It is the IOC that is
being judged, and the IOC that must deal with the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``Bidding cities which may have acted improperly are a
matter of the past; it is our IOC which is now on trial.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter what he says, Samaranch cannot possibly be the agent
for reform in his short time remaining _ Fightin' Juan Antonio, the
People's Choice. Hardly. There is nothing in his style, his
training, his history, to suggest cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   They were always a semipreposterous lot, with their blue blazers
and their badges and their titles, hiding behind barricades at
swank hotels while athletes sweltered in non-air-conditioned
dormitories in Barcelona, for example. Now it turns out there was
widespread corruption, too. Samaranch tolerated a system of
delegates beholden to him, who roamed the aspiring cities of the
earth, going out with empty trunks, coming home with full trunks.
</P>
<P>
   Now he says it was the other guys, that he knew nothing. But
Samaranch does not get off easily because the action now shifts to
the antithesis of the insular clubbiness of the IOC _ the
scatter-shot openness of the American Congress. Sen. John McCain,
R-Ariz., the chairman of the Commerce Committee, intends to hold a
hearing on the IOC on April 14.
</P>
<P>
   Used to operating behind walls and moats and electric fences,
the IOC must now go public because of that old Woodward and
Bernstein Watergate dictum _ follow the money.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese corporations donated copious amounts of money to the
IOC to get the 1998 Winter Games in Nagano. Sydney leaders made
sure there was enough money to hold off China for the 2000 Summer
Games. And the pious burghers of Salt Lake City instinctively
greased every delegate who asked for a little favor.
</P>
<P>
   But for truly big money, the trail goes to American-based
international corporations that sponsor the Olympic movement and
also advertise on television. These corporations would, of course,
never commit unethical acts such as bribing business contacts to
influence a bidding contest. That would be wrong, as President
Nixon once put it. These companies do not want their good names
besmirched by bad publicity.
</P>
<P>
   Money also comes into play because American tax dollars support
the IOC as well as the U.S. Olympic Committee. Normal American
citizens _ the little people _ are regularly cajoled to dip into
their piggy banks to support the Olympic ``movement.'' What are
they to think now?
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Olympic movement is only highly visible for 16
days every two years, it commands the world's attention because of
the slobbering obeisance paid by its television network partners
and the hushed, somber tones of the official films. Now people
titter about the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   It can only get worse for His Excellency. The bloodhounds are
out. The subcommittees haven't had anything interesting to do since
that nice Starr finished up. The IOC, in its dependence on American
money, could somehow fall into the province of Dick Armey and Bob
Barr. His Excellency may soon regret Wednesday's vote of support.
There is still time for His Excellency _ as we say in the States _
to do the right thing.  &QL;

SLOC'S ROMNEY KEEPS IT SIMPLE AND FRUGAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (s and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAUSANNE, Switzerland _ Mitt Romney hadn't known about the
vaulted ceiling, the gilded chandelier, the marble floors, the
burnished wood, the sumptuous draperies. All he knew was that his
staff had booked him into a hotel called the Beau Rivage. Nobody
told him that the lobby alone looked like Versailles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next time,'' Romney said, ``I think I'll be in the
Movenpick.''
</P>
<P>
   Until Tuesday, when he made his first report to the
International Olympic Committee's executive board, Salt Lake City's
new chief organizer had never been to Olympic headquarters. He had
never met IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch. He wasn't sure if
he should go bilingual.
</P>
<P>
   ``My French is a little rusty,'' Romney confessed, ``and I
didn't want to offend.''
</P>
<P>
   No worries there. Romney was the most popular man to show up at
the Chateau de Vidy in ages. On the eve of the most wrenching day
in IOC history, when its members are expected to expel six of their
colleagues for taking payoffs and gifts from the Salt Lake bidders,
IOC officials were delighted to see anybody from Utah who was
talking about 2002 and not 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``He presented easily and comfortably,'' said board member Kevan
Gosper of Australia after Romney had provided what is usually
considered a routine status report. ``He was quite front-footed and
positive.''
</P>
<P>
   And Romney was alone. That was a symbolic shock to IOC members
who are used to seeing a platoon of organizing committee officials
at their meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not spend travel money to have an entourage,'' Romney
declared.
</P>
<P>
   With the Salt Lake Organizing Committee still several hundred
million dollars short of breaking even, Romney has a new
philosophy: ``Profit, pride, and pageantry come second.'' After a
month on the job, he has chopped $14 million from his $1.45 billion
budget, imposed a hiring freeze, and told trustees that their free
lunches are over. And the IOC members will have no chauffeured
limousines at the Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be Blazers and Tahoes driven by volunteers,'' Romney
said.
</P>
<P>
   Romney says he'll apply the same spartan symbolism to himself.
He could have spent the week in this charming lakeside city,
chatting up IOC members over champagne and chateaubriand. Instead,
he arrived Tuesday morning, had lunch with Samaranch and the board,
and was headed home as dawn broke Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours later, the IOC was to decide whether to formally
expel the members who were ``excluded'' by the board here in
January. The cases will be heard in alphabetical order _ Agustin
Arroyo of Ecuador, Zein El Abdin Ahmed Abdel Gadir of Sudan,
Jean-Claude Ganga of the Republic of Congo, Lamine Keita of Mali,
Sergio Santander (Fantini) of Chile, and Seiuli Paul Wallwork of
Western Samoa. They will be taken up individually, with two-thirds
of the 91 votes necessary for expulsion.
</P>
<P>
   Romney saw no point in hanging around for the IOC's public
bloodletting, which stems from payoffs made by his Salt Lake
predecessors, and he wouldn't comment on anything mentioned in the
IOC, US Olympic Committee, or SLOC reports involving the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see my job to be focused entirely on 2002 and to spend no
time evaluating, investigating or speaking about the problems of
the past,'' Romney said. ``That will be left to those who had been
holding the reins during that time. I'm not going to dwell on the
past because I wasn't there.''
</P>
<P>
   But what the IOC does or doesn't do will have a decided impact
on the SLOC, which still needs $350 million from sponsors, many of
whom are wary of being linked to tarnished Olympic rings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need aggressive action, both substantive and symbolic
action, on the IOC's part,'' Romney acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC has promised that it will push through dramatic reforms
both this week and later this year. Besides expelling six members,
on top of the four who have already resigned, the IOC is expected
to change the way it selects host cities, allowing the full
membership (which already has been banned from visiting bidders) to
vote only for two finalists chosen by a smaller group. The
committee also will set up an independent outside panel to oversee
its ethics and take steps toward opening its books and reforming
the way its members are chosen.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the members leave the Palais de Beaulieu Thursday,
SLOC's chief organizer will be back in the shadow of the Mormon
Temple, tinkering with the budget and trying to persuade local
sponsors to sign on.

WADERS COME IN HANDY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRETT PAULY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For rivers like the East Walker, where foliage
along the banks is too thick to cast from, wading is the antidote.
Spending time in the water also brings anglers closer to the fish,
a big plus when playing a trophy trout.
</P>
<P>
   But unless it's a warm enough day to wade them, you'll want a
pair of waders.
</P>
<P>
   With all the varieties available, a little guidance can take
some of the confusion out of selecting waders for the right
circumstance and with the best value.
</P>
<P>
   Most come in three material types _ neoprene, ``breathable'' and
lightweight _ and two shapes _ chest waders and hip waders. We've
asked fly-fishing instructor and guide Ryan Shadrin, a spokesman
for Orvis fishing and outdoor gear in Manchester, Vt., to help
unravel the complexities.
</P>
<P>
   When determining which style to use, it's key to consider the
temperature of the air, not the water.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say if the outside air is below freezing, and, generally,
there is snow and ice and bitter cold, neoprenes _ the
heaviest-duty waders _ are best,'' Shadrin said. ``But we only
suggest them for the most extreme conditions _ steelhead fishing in
Alaska or trout fishing on the Bighorn River in Montana in January.
Something where you are going to really get cold quickly without
thick insulation.''
</P>
<P>
   Expect to pay from $85 for neoprenes with a thickness of 2mm to
$300 for a pair of super-thick 4mm neoprenes.
</P>
<P>
   It used to be that neoprene _ the same material divers and
surfers use _ was suggested for a broader range of temperatures,
but it tends to trap heat if it's not extremely cold, creating
clammy, uncomfortable moisture on the skin.
</P>
<P>
   That changed about four years ago, Shadrin said, with the
development of breathable waders, which have a membrane made of
Gortex or a similar material sandwiched between layers of fabric.
The membrane allows water in the form of vapor (perspiration) to
flow out, keeping anglers dry and comfy, while water in liquid form
(the river) cannot penetrate.
</P>
<P>
   Most salespeople will pitch breathable waders first. It's no
coincidence they are usually the most expensive ($130 to $300 or
more), but for good reason; they are the most versatile and the
only pair an angler will need in most situations.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves lightweight waders, which typically have a
medium-weight nylon outer material coated with a plastic. While
economical ($50 to $100) and tough to rip or puncture, they aren't
recommended for extreme conditions _ not warm enough for the cold
and too sweaty for the heat. ``If these were the only waders you
owned and it was very hot, then `wet-wade,''' Shadrin suggests.
</P>
<P>
   Wet-wading _ walking the river with bare legs _ is a refreshing
option in the height of summer. To prevent losing your footing on
the river bottom, continue to use your wading shoes _ or fit the
soles of sneakers or heavy-duty sandals with no-slip felt sold at
tackle shops.
</P>
<P>
   Most waders fit to the chest, but hip-high waders are a viable
option for anglers targeting creeks and small streams, hikers who
want to pack in something to fish for brook trout in ankle-high
waters and those who don't wade but go in the water to release
fish. However, ``hippers'' limit one's versatility because big fish
can't be chased into deeper waters and they are impractical in
spring when rivers run high and fast.
</P>
<P>
   Hip waders are stitched together from lightweight and breathable
materials and run for less than $25 to about $100.

SAFETY COMES FIRST
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Being safe is a fishing essential, especially when
casting in a crowd. Hooking a fellow angler can ruin even an epic
bite.
</P>
<P>
   Practice extreme caution when in close proximity to others _
including on piers and bank-fishing, but particularly on party
boats _ by never taking your eye off the lure or bait when tossing
a line. That way you can stop your casting motion immediately if
you spot someone hooked up with a big fish coming up the rail right
at you or a deckhand running with a gaff behind you. And, don't
worry, it's very difficult to miss the ocean, no matter how closely
you watch the bait.
</P>
<P>
   If you are at all unsure about your casting ability, talk to a
deckhand or the captain and ask to be shown how to properly toss a
line in a crowd. Or watch a prolific caster and carefully mimic the
technique. Or practice from the boat's bow _ away from the bait
tank, the chum line and most anglers.
</P>
<P>
   When boarding, ask the crew about casting rules. Many skippers
require that jigs must be cast forward of the crowded bait-tank
area. On half-day boats, for example, anglers often must leave
their rods at the rail when getting bait to avoid hooking anyone at
the bait tank. But on long-range boats, anglers must bring their
rods to the bait tank so that an unattended rod doesn't get fouled
up with an angler who is hooked up with a tuna.
</P>
<P>
   When storing a rod in the boat's rod holders, make sure all
hooks are pinned securely to the rod. And be certain that jigs and
lures are attached low and to the side of the reel, not on a guide
higher up, so that if one of those big treble hooks do get loose it
won't catch a passer-by in the face, which hurts a whole lot more
than being hooked in the leg. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Fishing tips are offered on an occasional basis by San Diego calico
bass angler and plastic-lure tactician Barry Brightenburg. &QL;

COMMENTARY: HOLBROOKE ON HOLD 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ We might be more effective in stopping the fighting
in Kosovo if we had a credibly tough diplomat like Richard
Holbrooke on the job.
</P>
<P>
   Why is the troubleshooter whom President Clinton nominated to be
our U.N. representative not grabbing the Serbian leader's lapels?
He's caught in crossfire at home.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke became an issue only because the Reno Justice
Department's discredited ``Public Integrity'' office, after taking
a dive for Clinton in Chinagate, wanted to show it could embarrass
a lesser Democrat. It buffed up a weak State report about conflict
of interest and threatened Holbrooke with a lifetime in limbo;
without acknowledging wrongdoing, he anted up a $5,000 settlement
to move the nomination forward.
</P>
<P>
   Now Senate Foreign Relations staff is diligently wading through
all the records he produced. But the private dealings of this
particular nominee _ despite pouting by bureaucrats aggrieved by
his sharp elbows and blunt style _ are not what will delay his
dispatch to the Kosovo front with the necessary senatorial
imprimatur.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is resentment of the United Nations. the issue, although it
is all too often a bastion of appeasement and anti-U.S. sentiment.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan has cut his payroll and is carrying
out many of the reforms he promised the Foreign Relations chairman,
Jesse Helms, who proposes to cut the U.S. share of the U.N. upkeep
from 25 percent to 20.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion is the sticking point. Pro-life absolutists in the
House and pro-choice absolutists in the White House have combined
to make us diplomatic deadbeats. Holbrooke is this year's symbol of
their grudge fight.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Helms and the ranking Democrat, Joe Biden,
hammered out a compromise to pay our back dues provided the United
Nations cleaned up its act. But Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J., attached
a rider in the House including the Reagan-Bush order prohibiting
U.S. funding of all organizations that perform abortions abroad, an
order that Clinton had revoked soon after his election.
</P>
<P>
   An irate Helms told Smith, ``I was fighting abortion when you
were still wetting your diapers,'' and to attach his rider to
something else. No soap. Facing a certain veto, Helms and Biden
worked out with former Speaker Gingrich a milder substitute,
stopping taxpayer subsidies only to organizations that lobby
governments to change abortion laws.
</P>
<P>
   But in the Year of Monica, feminists' silence was more important
to Clinton than any agreement to break our U.N. impasse. NOW
delivered, zipping its lip about sexual harassment, and the
president killed the Helms-Biden compromise.
</P>
<P>
   In today's move-on mode, can new life be breathed into that
bipartisan bill to rejoin the world? The Senate is ready but the
president is not.
</P>
<P>
   Not only does Clinton object to the modified Smith rider ending
Planned Parenthood's subsidy, he wants to keep our share up at 25
percent, and to pay what the United Nations says we owe in arrears,
not what we say we owe, a difference of $76 million. Then he wants
to diminish budget oversight and make ``technical adjustments.''
</P>
<P>
   Reached in his wheelchair in the Senate, Jesse Helms says: ``We
didn't stop paying U.N. dues because we were broke, but because the
U.N. was in a mess. I had a good visit with Kofi Annan, and he
agreed to a 20 percent U.S. share.''
</P>
<P>
   What about a Helms-Biden bill stripped of its controversial
abortion rider? ``We forwarded him (Clinton) a good piece of
legislation. I'd like to hear him say `I'll sign the bill if you
get this rider out of it.' Then it would be up to the House to be
helpful, and that would get this matter moving.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton wants not only an abortion victory, but a giveback of
all his compromises. ``Now he's saying we've got to pay all the
arrears the U.N. claims. Well, I dissent.'' If Clinton wants to
make a deal, he has a trusted go-between in Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright: ``Madeleine never lied to me, and that goes a
distance in this city.''
</P>
<P>
   And Holbrooke's nomination? It's a pawn Clinton seems willing to
sacrifice, despite its weakening his Balkan negotiation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to cry if we don't send anybody to the U.N. for
a while,'' says Helms. ``We can wait. I'm available, if the
president wants to do business, but he's been `silent in seven
languages.''' He adds, ``That's a North Carolina expression.''

ISLAMIC WORLD OPENS DOOR TO THE INTERNET, BUT RESTRICTIONS ARE
MANY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: This story was previously sent and held and is now released
for publication.)   (wg) 
 By DOUGLAS JEHL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia _ Ever so gingerly, the Internet is being
allowed across some final frontiers, into restrictive parts of the
Islamic world, under the wary eye of governments used to playing
Big Brother.
</P>
<P>
   In places like Saudi Arabia, where access was barred until two
months ago, the change is being hailed as a belated revolution.
Internet cafes have sprung up in Teheran and Riyadh, and novices
are being dazzled by sites like Yahoo.com.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the authorities are trying to have it both ways.
</P>
<P>
   In Iran, users _ who are monitored by some providers _ must
promise, among other things, that they ``will not contact stations
against Islamic regulations'' _ a reference to those with sexual
content. Violators are warned that they could lose Internet
privileges.
</P>
<P>
   Censorship in Saudi Arabia is even more overt. Under a system
that took two years to develop, all Internet connections in the
country have been routed through a hub outside Riyadh, where
high-speed government computers block access to thousands of sites
catalogued on a rapidly-expanding blacklist.
</P>
<P>
   Want to check out what opposition groups abroad have to say
about the ruling al-Saud family? ``Forbidden!!!'' the computer
responds. How about a chat service that allows for, well,
free-wheeling conversation? No again. A game of blackjack? Uh-uh.
</P>
<P>
   ``All access attempts are logged,'' users are somberly warned,
in a hint that attempt to stray beyond what the Saudi government
considers acceptable bounds could have further, unspecified
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the enthusiasm with which the Internet is being received
seems to reflect a view that a little access is better than none at
all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I get angry that we had to wait so long,'' said
Hisham A. Turkistani, 25, a young Saudi who sat hunched over a
computer in Jidda's Cafe de Paris, Saudi Arabia's first Internet
cafe, listening to Mariah Carey on mtv.com. ``But now the Internet
is all that my friends and I talk about. There are so many things
in this world.''
</P>
<P>
   On a recent evening at the cafe in Jidda, on the Red Sea coast,
other customers _ who were paying $12 an hour for the privilege _
included a medical student, Hilal Sonbul, 25, clearly amazed as a
technician showed him how much information about his future
profession could be found with a few keystrokes.
</P>
<P>
   Across the Persian Gulf in Iran, at another brand-new cafe, a
young man was sending an electronic greeting card to a friend in
the United States. He had also spent his Friday afternoon
downloading applications, he said, for admission to graduate
schools, among them the engineering program at the City University
of New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to take three or four weeks for letters to get
through; now it takes a few seconds,'' said the young man, who
would give his name only as Hamid. ``I know that some people here
are afraid of the Internet, but I don't think most of them even
know what the Internet is.''
</P>
<P>
   Technophobia is hardly new to the Middle East, where the
sensitivities of strict Islamic cultures and the worries of
security-conscious regimes have long been combined to justify
censorship.
</P>
<P>
   At one time or another, every government in the region has
jammed radio broadcasts, intercepted publications, scuttled fax
transmissions, barred mobile telephones, or prohibited satellite
television.
</P>
<P>
   Since the arrival of the Internet, however, many countries,
including Egypt, Jordan and Lebanon, have quietly conceded the
fight, concluding that the benefits of the new technology far
outweigh the cost. In these countries and others, essentially
unrestricted Internet access has been available since the
mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Still, more conservative governments like those in Syria, Iraq,
Iran and Saudi Arabia, have done their best to keep walls in place.
There is no Internet access in Iraq and Syria, where the concept is
being studied by a committee headed by the son of President Hafez
al-Assad _ an indication of the matter's sensitivity.
</P>
<P>
   In Iran, an Islamic Republic that prohibits the publication of
photographs of women unless their heads and bodies are covered,
ordinary people were not permitted graphic access to the Internet
until December 1996, after the election of President Mohammad
Khatami ushered in an era of relative openness. Even now, the
service, whose prices begin at $330 a year for one hour a day,
remains too costly for all but a few.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In Saudi Arabia, it was not until January that users could get
access to the Internet without first establishing an account abroad
and then connecting to the provider via an international call, at a
cost of at least $1 a minute.
</P>
<P>
   Under new rules, 42 local providers have been licensed, after a
high-level government study that lasted two years. But the service
has been plagued by growing pains, and only 10,000 Saudis have
signed up so far, though some 115,000 are expected by the end of
the year _ a small fraction in a country of 20 million people.
</P>
<P>
   And still, neither delays nor limitations have assuaged fears
that the information highway is a road to corruption.
</P>
<P>
   A top Iranian cleric, Ayatollah Janatti, warned in a recent
Friday sermon that the ``disgraceful, immoral pictures'' broadcast
on the Internet were an affront to ``all humanity, morality and
chastity'' that ``threatens us all.'' Even now, the Iranian
government still has not officially legalized Internet use, perhaps
with an eye to conservative militias that have threatened attacks
on the offices of Internet providers.
</P>
<P>
   In Saudi Arabia, criticism has been muted since King Fahd
himself issued a decree in March 1997 calling for the drafting of
guidelines for Internet use, thus offering the idea his implicit
endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the system is in place, Saudi officials are seeking to
call attention to what is quickly becoming available _ including
Internet banking _ instead of what is banned. ``There is nothing to
block except two things _ that which is against our religion, and
that which is against our society,'' said Abdullah al-Rasheed,
deputy director of the King Abdelaziz Center for Science and
Technology, a government entity that supervises the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, those criteria have proven far-reaching. One local
provider's effort to establish a Saudi chat site was rejected,
apparently out of concern that it would allow contact between
unmarried men and women _ still taboo in a society in which even
dating is prohibited.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently for similar reasons, videoconferencing also remains
off limits. Sites containing nudity or sexual material are rendered
inaccessible. And the absolute ban on content ``against our
society'' has kept a lid on political dissent, barring access to
sites that offer any hint of criticism of the Saudi government.
</P>
<P>
   The restrictions have prompted some quiet criticism, mostly from
parents who argue that online contact between young people is a
healthy alternative to trying to suppress such contact altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not hearing the voice, they're not seeing the face, so
where is the haram there?'' asked Samar Fatany, a radio
broadcaster, using the Arabic word for something prohibited for
religious reasons. ``I don't think anyone can label it as a sin.''
</P>
<P>
   To enforce the rules, the Saudi government has assumed the role
of parent _ using commercial software like Smart Filter, by Secure
Computer, to screen all requests and block contact to sites it
wants kept off-limits. The software is updated every day, Saudi
officials say, as Riyadh-based technicians add new sites to he
blacklist _ in part by watching to see which sites the Saudis seek
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of scary,'' said Fadlil Khaliallah, 33, manager of
the Internet cafe in Jidda. ``If someone manages to get on to a bad
site, we notice that it is always blocked by the next day.''
</P>
<P>
   With thousands of new web sites created every day, savvy users
can keep a step ahead of most restrictions; even Saudi officials
concede that keeping the blacklist up to date represents an uphill
fight. Still, they say they are determined to make sure that
Internet use in Saudi Arabia is kept within acceptable bounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two choices,'' said Fahad al-Hoyany, a computer
scientist with degrees from three American universities who heads
the government's Internet Services Unit. ``Either you let it go
altogether, or you try to limit it, and we hope to at least protect
the innocents.''

HONG KONG MOVIE THEATERS GO DARK TO PROTEST   PIRACY OF FILMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By   MARK LANDLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ The stars were on glittering display in Hong Kong
Wednesday, though not on the silver screen.
</P>
<P>
   Movie theaters across the territory went dark for the day to
protest the flood of illegally copied films. An array of local film
and pop celebrities led a rally of 2,000 people to demand a tougher
crackdown on piracy.
</P>
<P>
   Film producers say the Hong Kong film industry, once one of the
largest exporters of movies after Hollywood, has been devastated by
the explosive growth of movies illegally recorded onto compact
disks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a downward spiral,'' said Woody Tsung, the chief
executive of the Motion Picture Industry Association. ``The only
way we can come out of this crisis is if the government gets rid of
piracy.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the doomsday talk, the protest Wednesday was a bubbly
affair. Jackie Chan, perhaps Hong Kong's biggest star, showed up in
a black-suede jacket and matching pants to serve as the unofficial
marshal. As crowds squealed and cameras flashed, it was hard to
tell the politics and the pop culture apart.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong was taken off a watch list by the U.S. government last
month after it stepped up efforts to raid factories that produce
illegally copied material. But executives here say the former
British colony remains one of the worst offenders in Asia for
copyright violations.
</P>
<P>
   The protest rally also included representatives of the music,
cable-television and computer-software industries _ all of whom
called on the Hong Kong government to assign police officers to
close factories that make illegal software and to arrest the
merchants who peddle it.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong's movie industry, in particular, has been damaged by
the advent of video compact disks, which can be bought for $2 in
stores or at street stalls, often days before the films are
released in theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Tsung said the industry did not have reliable figures for how
much money it loses each year as a result of illegally copied
movies. But he said the box office revenue of Hong Kong films
declined from $168 million in 1993 to $54 million last year, and he
attributed 95 percent of the decline to piracy.
</P>
<P>
   Theater owners said they lost about $250,000 by shutting down
cinemas Wednesday. They, too, contend that they are in a battle for
survival. Five years ago, Hong Kong had 180 cinemas. Today, with so
many people buying bootleg disks instead of tickets to the local
multiplex, the number has fallen to 73.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's incredible,'' said Rigo Jesu, an executive at the
Intercontinental Group, which distributes films and operates
cinemas here. ``I don't know of a situation like this anywhere else
in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   In the deserted lobby of Queen's Theater in central Hong Kong, a
sign on the box office window apologized for being closed. It
added: ``Imagine a city without cinemas. If piracy is allowed to
continue, this will be the result.''
</P>
<P>
   In a signal that the government regards piracy as a grave issue,
Hong Kong's chief executive, Tung Chee-hwa, emerged from his office
to accept a petition from the protesters. In a statement, he said:
``We will not allow piracy or counterfeiting activities to tarnish
Hong Kong's reputation.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Customs officials conducted raids throughout the
territory and said they seized 350,000 pirated optical disks, worth
an estimated $683,000, and arrested 37 suspects. In all of 1998,
Hong Kong seized 39 million pirated disks and arrested 1,645
people.
</P>
<P>
   But industry executives said Hong Kong must assign the police to
crack down on the merchants who sell pirated software, since they
are too widely dispersed for the 220 Customs officials to handle.
</P>
<P>
   The problem extends beyond movies. More than half the sales of
some recordings in Hong Kong are generated by illegal copies,
according to Frank Brown, the president of MTV Networks Asia.
``Hong Kong is amongst the worst in the region, though not as bad
as India and China,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Some executives have faulted the United States for lifting the
pressure on Hong Kong by removing it from the watch list. It was
put on the list only last year, after evidence emerged that illegal
CD factories were moving from mainland China to Hong Kong and
nearby Macao.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the American Consulate, Barbara Zigli, said:
``We remain very concerned about the high rate of piracy at the
retail level in Hong Kong. Obviously this is hurting business.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One challenge for Hong Kong is persuading the public not to buy
illegal copies. Wu Chun-keung, a 26-year-old construction worker
who watched the rally Wednesday, said he could not justify paying
$7 for a single movie ticket when he could buy a package of 10
bootleg movies for $12. ``It's so cheap that I have to buy them,''
he said. ``If they shut down every store, I'll go back to the movie
theaters.''
</P>
<P>
   As bad as piracy is here, some film executives said it was not
the only culprit for the decline of the Hong Kong movie industry,
which produced only 86 films in 1998, compared with 426 in 1993.
Threadbare scripts, second-rate special effects and the juggernaut
of Hollywood have all helped siphon box office receipts from
locally produced films.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decline of the industry was not precipitated by piracy,''
said Barbara Robinson, the managing director of Columbia Pictures
Film Production Asia. ``It kicked the industry in the knees, as it
was already stumbling.''

 &HT;    Auction clears out Hayes headquarters
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Some searched for bargains, others for the past. And
some were seeking both.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,000 people Wednesday poured into what once was Hayes
Corp.'s headquarters in Norcross, Ga., to be part of the two-day
auction to empty the four buildings that once housed the world's
dominant modem maker.
</P>
<P>
   Crowds of former Hayes employees were there, including many who
have landed at companies now bearing the technology torch once
carried by Hayes. They chatted in the halls or strolled outside in
the sun, stopping occasionally to peer in an office window.
</P>
<P>
   But some were bidding.
</P>
<P>
   R. Nuri Otus, president of Emerald Asset Management, which was
hired to run the auction, kicked off the event with the injunction
that participants enjoy themselves. ``It is more fun buying
something at an auction than anywhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   That judgment seemed to quickly win endorsement as item after
item drew enthusiastic bidding and a sometimes feverish will to
win. That victory sometimes came with a price that some spectators
found inflated _ compared to Internet sales or even prices for new
machines.
</P>
<P>
   Otus, hired to raise as much money as possible to pay off Hayes
Corp. debts, defended it all. A 400 MHz Pentium system sold for
$1,300. ``That's only 30 cents on the dollar,'' Otus said. ``It's
worth that. It's a great value.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a chorus of boos from the crowd. Otus smiled.
</P>
<P>
   Bidders had been permitted to view items Monday and Tuesday.
Wednesday, they had a catalog listing and only had to waggle their
registration cards to bid. Some potential bidders said they were
discouraged by the lack of bargains in the early going.
</P>
<P>
   A map of the world sold for $1,300. A roomful of plants went for
$200.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Ragusa, who worked for five years at Hayes, was at the
auction to flesh out an office at Solectron in Duluth, where he now
works. Joe Anderson of Buford was hoping to pick up a computer for
his personal use. Sam Davis of Telesync in Norcross was looking for
electronic test equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Maurice Tift, owner of Leesburg-based Digital Depot, bought a
room of office basics like shelves for $750. ``I'd like a few
computers and modems, if the prices don't get too high.''
</P>
<P>
   In one hallway, a vendor sold candy and soda. Nearby hung a
painting of neckties and another of dogs. Above a cluster of empty
chairs hung a banner proclaiming Project Overture ``Prelude to the
Information Age.''
</P>
<P>
   In what seemed a live demonstration of crowd psychology, Otus
rapped out a rapid-fire narration, coaxing bidders to outdo each
other, hyping whatever item was on the block. ``Eight hundred, bid
825 _ are we all done?'' he snapped.
</P>
<P>
   A coffee table sold for $75. A notebook computer went for
$1,200. Some 56k bps modems sold for $100 each. A microwave oven
sold for $40, a refrigerator for $600.
</P>
<P>
   ``IBM typewriters,'' Otus sang out. ``Listen to me. You don't
need this computer stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Some items were clearly obsolete. Some hardly seemed dated at
all.
</P>
<P>
   The contents of ``Room 4,'' workstations and chairs, sold for
$4,500. One of many Hewlett-Packard laserjet printers sold for
$450. Up came a Compaq 80486 with a Gateway monitor and Epson
printer. ``Can I have $5,000?'' shouted Otus in mock seriousness.
``How about 50 bucks to go?''
</P>
<P>
   The winning bid was $175.
</P>
<P>
   Offers on a table started at $100 and leaped to $900 in seconds
while a woman held a wireless phone and relayed the interest of a
bidder at the other end. Finally, she nodded to the spotter. ``He's
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Otus called for bids on an executive desk and chair. ``These
were in the office of Dennis Hayes ... and others.''
</P>
<P>
   It sold for $3,250.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spotters'' for Otus roamed the aisles, pointing, shouting,
cajoling and signaling for ever-higher bids.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just wanted to be part of the show,'' said William Hooper,
who worked at Hayes for six years, and is now principal engineer at
Advanced Charger Technology. He was sent to the auction to buy a
digitizing oscilloscope, a $10,000 machine he had first purchased
for Hayes. He ended up paying more than he expected _ $5,500.
</P>
<P>
   Hooper found himself bidding against Dale Heatherington, a
co-founder with Dennis Hayes of the company that became Hayes Corp.
As it turned out, there were two devices. Hooper and Heatherington
each came away with one.
</P>
<P>
   By day's end today, Emerald plans to have called for bids 4,115
times, counting the very first, unnumbered item.
</P>
<P>
   Holding up a hockey stick that had been found in the former
office of founder Dennis Hayes, Otus read the 1993 inscription:
``Happy B-Day, Dennis Hayes.'' The signature, he said, was that of
superstar Wayne Gretzky. ``That's my story and I'm sticking to
it,'' Otus said.
</P>
<P>
   The stick sold for $500.

 &HT;    Homeowners' fancy turns to projects in the spring
 &HT;    By Susan Harte
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As spring approaches, many Americans are beginning to
think about sprucing up their homes. In fact, 62 percent of
households are planning some kind of improvement or redecorating
project in 1999, according to the American Express Retail Index.
Consumers will spend an average of $2,747 on everything from
landscaping to room expansion.
</P>
<P>
   But a new study warns homeowners, particularly the elderly,
should use caution in hiring home improvement contractors.
Complaints about home improvement contractors rank second only to
gripes about automobile dealers, according to a study released
Wednesday by the senior citizens advocate group AARP. One in four
consumers reported having a problem with home repair companies,
AARP said.

 &HT;    Frontier phone company bought by Bermuda's Global Crossing
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Frontier Corp., a telephone company that has its
regional headquarters in Atlanta, is being acquired by
Bermuda-based upstart Global Crossing Ltd. for $11.2 billion in
stock.
</P>
<P>
   Frontier is the fifth-largest long-distance company and the
tenth-largest local phone company in the nation, mainly serving
small and medium-sized businesses.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to phone service, the company offers high-speed data
and Internet services. Its customers in Atlanta include InfoCure
and Habitat for Humanity.
</P>
<P>
   At one time, Atlanta-based Cox Communications partnered with
Frontier to provide long-distance telephone service. For all
practical purposes, however, that business arrangement has ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are anticipating virtually no impact (from the proposed
merger). We have a very limited relationship with Frontier,'' said
Amy Porter, a spokeswoman for Cox. Porter said the long-distance
service is no longer being marketed but that the a few thousand
remaining customers are still being served. None of those customers
are in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Cox Communications is controlled by Cox Enterprises Inc., which
owns The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's deal provides a U.S. foothold for Global Crossing, a
2-year-old company that's building a worldwide fiber-optic network
to carry voice, data, video and Internet traffic.
</P>
<P>
   With the addition of Frontier, that network would connect 159
cities in the United States, Japan, Europe and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Global Crossing recently hired a top AT&AMP;T executive to become
its chief executive. Robert Annunziata was the former head of
Teleport Communications Group, a local telephone company he built
up and sold to AT&AMP;T for $12 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   Global Crossing is offering $62 a share in stock for each
Frontier share, a 40 percent premium over Frontier's closing price
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange, Frontier climbed $5.87 1/2 to
$50.50 a share, or 13 percent, after hitting a 52-week high of
52.75. The stock is up nearly 50 percnet year to date.

BLAKE DOWNPLAYS ROLE MEETING PLAYED IN TURNAROUND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Rob Blake is right.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Blake's players-only meeting last week, and subsequent
meetings with the Kings' coaching staff, had nothing to do with the
impressive victories that followed.
</P>
<P>
   This is what the low-key Blake would have you believe,
downplaying to the bitter end the impact of his words, even as his
teammates continue to praise him for standing up and asserting
himself as the Kings' captain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody makes a pretty big deal of it,'' Blake said
following Wednesday's practice at the Forum. ``I don't think it's
that big a deal.''
</P>
<P>
   His teammates and coaches disagree.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of the meeting, Coach Larry Robinson spoke of
the need for a captain to be able to stand before his teammates
``and maybe hurt a few feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Luc Robitaille said, ``I know how much things were
bothering him the last few months. The truth is always the best
remedy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings (26-36-5) play host to the Mighty Ducks tonight,
seeking their fourth consecutive victory in a late-season bid to
squeak into the playoffs, which begin next month.
</P>
<P>
   And if the Kings achieve their objective, Blake's vocal role
will be remembered as the turning point, whether he likes it or
not.
</P>
<P>
   It also probably will be remembered as a moment when the
29-year-old Blake matured into his role as the Kings' captain, a
position he has held since the 1996-97 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's taken more of a take-charge attitude,'' Robinson said.
``That's great to see. The respect has always been there. But he's
never been a vocal type, to really show his feelings and speak up.
You look at the good teams. (Detroit's Steve Yzerman) is more of a
silent type. But the last four or five years, he's really spoken up
and gotten everybody on the same page, and look at the change
they've had.''
</P>
<P>
   After years of disappointment, the Red Wings have won the last
two Stanley Cups, and Yzerman has been credited with leading the
way on and off the ice. No one expects the Kings to win the Stanley
Cup this year, but if Blake's words catapult them into the
playoffs, he will have done his job.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Robby came out and talked to us, it really hit home for a
lot of us,'' winger Russ Courtnall said. ``I think we're a better
team for it. We all think a lot of Rob as a person and a player. It
was tough for him because it's not like him to get up and speak.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did it, and he did it so well. I was really proud of him. I
have even more respect for Rob than I did before. If some guys
didn't know it before, they definitely know now that he is in
control of this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Blake always has been a leader on the ice, but the opportunity
or need for him to lead off it never had been greater.
</P>
<P>
   The first five years of Blake's career, the Kings were Wayne
Gretzky's team. Gretzky was traded during Blake's sixth season, but
Blake missed almost the entire year with a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   The next season, the Kings were in the depths of a rebuilding
program, and Blake was battling his way back from the knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, during which Blake won the Norris Trophy as the
NHL's top defenseman, there was no single moment when the critical
mass of negative events called for the measures Blake took last
week.
</P>
<P>
   He may wish he'd acted sooner, but there is little point in
second-guessing. The point is that he acted.
</P>
<P>
   He called the meeting and spoke honestly, not sparing feelings.
Then, in a separate meeting, Blake asked Robinson to stick with a
lineup, and Robinson listened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll run the dressing room, I'll take that responsibility,''
Blake said, ``but Larry has got to respect what I have to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson has continued to listen to Blake this week, and the
Kings haven't made a false step since their captain stepped
forward.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't mean the Kings will go undefeated the rest of the
season, or that they'll definitely make the playoffs. But that
would seem to miss the point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen him grow,'' Courtnall said. ``I think it took a lot
of guts to talk to us. When you're not a speaker, to talk to a lot
of guys, it's tough. He's a quiet man. He leads by his actions. It
took a lot for him.''

 &HT;    Apple in sharing mood with Mac OS X software
 &HT;    By Jerry Mahoney
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Apple Computer Inc. has little to lose and potentially
much to gain by letting software developers tweak its new operating
system for servers, computing experts said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Mac OS X Server, which went on sale Tuesday for $499, is
Apple's first true system for servers and gives Apple a powerful
entry in the low end of that market, said James Staten of
DataQuest.
</P>
<P>
   Servers are powerful computers that support networks of PCs in
offices, process bank-teller machine transactions, handle the
world's e-mail and host Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   While Apple's new system will look and ``feel'' like the Mac OS,
it is rooted in Unix, the powerful operating system used in most of
the world's ``mission critical'' jobs. Those are applications, such
as data retrieval, whose loss during a computer crash could cripple
a company or government agency.
</P>
<P>
   Apple acknowledged it is aiming considerably lower than those
jobs with Mac OS X, which it is bundling on its $4,999 Macintosh
Server G3.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts agree there may be a market for the system among
less-experienced users who want to set up a Web site as well as
many schools that have remained loyal to Macs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're focusing on departments within companies, small
businesses, education institutions and even individuals who want a
high-performance server (and) who are not Unix geeks,'' said Henry
Norr, former editor of MacWeek.
</P>
<P>
   He said that setting up a Web site is simple on Mac OS X, while
features such as NetBoot simplify the process of adding
applications for networks of PCs and make it less likely students
can tamper with the applications.
</P>
<P>
   Apple hopes that making its ``source code,'' the original lines
of instructions, available to software developers will result in
improvements that will be added to future versions.
</P>
<P>
   In that, it joins the growing ``open source'' movement that has
been highlighted by the popularity of Linux.
</P>
<P>
   That is the Unix-based system that has evolved quickly in recent
months as developers downloaded it free from the Internet and
shared improvements they made. As a result, major computer
companies such as Dell Computer Corp. and IBM will include Linux in
some of their server products.
</P>
<P>
   ``Linux adherents have been passionate about it,'' said Tom
Edgar, associate vice president of computing at the University of
Texas. ``Apple is hoping to capitalize on the same thing.

SENATE GIVES INITIAL OK TO `PARENTAL RIGHTS BILL' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By POLLY ROSS HUGHES 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Girls 17 and younger could no longer seek legal
abortions in Texas without notifying a parent or judge under a bill
initially approved, 23-8, by the Texas Senate on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a parental rights bill,'' said Sen. Florence Shapiro,
R-Plano, sponsor of the measure. ``In fact, most parents are
shocked ... that their minor child can have this invasive medical
procedure without their knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Bill 30, known as the parental notification bill, is
nearly identical to a measure passed by the Senate in 1997 but
killed in the House on a technicality. The sponsor, Rep. Arlene
Wohlgemuth, R-Burleson, reacted to the death of the bill by using
the same technicality to wipe out dozens of bills in a retaliation
dubbed the ``Memorial Day Massacre.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, even family planning groups opposed to the
legislation are predicting it will pass in some form this session,
saying there are enough votes in the House in favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I appreciate the leadership Senator Shapiro has shown on this
issue,'' said Gov. George W. Bush, calling the bill ``a positive
step to reduce the number of abortions in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   However, opponents predicted that frightened young girls will
turn to illegal and unsafe abortions or suicide rather than admit
to a parent or judge that they are pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you prevent her from going to some back-room doctor in
Houston, Texas, or down to Mexico and crossing the border and
getting an abortion?'' asked Sen. John Whitmire, D-Houston.
</P>
<P>
   For 3 1/2 hours, however, those arguments were shot down by
backers of the bill who said parents' rights must be restored.
</P>
<P>
   ``As legislators,'' said Shapiro, ``we owe this not only to the
children of this state, but we owe it even more to the parents of
this state.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill requires doctors to notify a parent or guardian 48
hours before an abortion can be performed on a minor. If the parent
can't be notified by phone, the waiting period begins the day a
certified letter is mailed. Doctors who don't comply could be
prosecuted for a Class A misdemeanor, with a maximum penalty of a
year in the county jail and/or a $4,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   In cases where a teen-aged girl insists her parents not be told,
a judge can make the decision to authorize or deny the abortion
instead. This process, called ``judicial bypass'' troubled many of
the senators, although an amendment allowing clergy or mental
health professionals also to act in behalf of parents, failed.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jeff Wentworth, R-San Antonio, said under the proposal a
judge who determines a minor is mature and informed can authorize
an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reverse of that is if the court finds out that the minor
is not mature, she can become a mother,'' he said. ``She has to
become a mother under this law.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the percentage of Texas teens who don't involve their
parents voluntarily is 10 percent or 39 percent, society _ their
parents, schools and churches _ have failed them, he argued.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these girls that are 12 and 13 and 14 years old who
watch MTV, who are surrounded by a society that is all too
concentrated on sex, don't know that fooling around with their
boyfriend who is two or three years older can get them pregnant.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the bill, judges from county courts at law, probate courts
or district courts can act as the judicial bypass. Whitmire offered
an unsuccessful amendment that would also allow justices of the
peace who are ``closer to the community'' to also make the
decision. For one thing, he said, many more of them speak Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mike Moncrief, D-Fort Worth, questioned whether candidates
who run on anti-abortion platforms are in the best position to
decide the issue. Shapiro said judges routinely refuse to take
public positions on matters that come before them in court.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me tell you about Harris County,'' said Whitmire, noting
that several judges there ``run on an anti-abortion slate. We're
going to force her to the Harris County Courthouse where we all
know locally there is an anti-abortion atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Steve Ogden, R-Bryan, praised a provision that would
require a judge to report any child abuse _ such as incest _ to
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think your bill addresses a very powerful issue that needs
to get up to the surface,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Human Services Committee Chairman Judith Zaffirini,
D-Laredo, said Shapiro's parental notification measure has support
from 74 percent of Texans polled. She also cited numbers showing
nearly three times as many people registered or testified in favor
of the bill than against it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to ask you this question and ask you to ponder it
once again,'' Shapiro said at the close of the debate. ``Who should
be involved in the important decision making for children?''
</P>
<P>
   Senators agreed to wait another day before voting on final
passage of the bill. They first wish to draft and consider an
amendment that would offer doctors a defense against criminal
prosecution for unwittingly accepting fake identification from a
minor.

ENGLISH COURT TO DELIVER PINOCHET'S FATE MARCH 24  
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Gen. Augusto Pinochet will learn next week whether he
is free to return to Chile or must remain in England to face
possible extradition to Spain on charges of crimes against
humanity.
</P>
<P>
   The Law Lords, Britain's highest court, said Wednesday that they
would make public next Wednesday their ruling on his claim that as
a former head of state he has immunity from arrest. He has been
held under house arrest in England since Oct. 16 in response to an
application from a Spanish judge seeking his extradition to Madrid
to stand trial on charges of murder, torture and kidnapping in
connection with the deaths or disappearances of more than 3,000
people in the 17 years he ruled Chile.
</P>
<P>
   The High Court ruled in Pinochet's favor on Oct. 28, but the Law
Lords a month later reversed the verdict in a decision that in
effect obliged him to stay in England for what was expected to be
at least a year of extradition hearings and appeals. That decision
was set aside when it emerged that one of the judges had failed to
declare his connection to Amnesty International, a party to the
case. A new panel held 12 days of hearings that ended Feb. 4.
</P>
<P>
   The former Chilean dictator, 83, has been living in a rented
house in a London suburb since being released on Dec. 1 from a
hospital where he was recovering from back surgery. He has
denounced the charges against him as ``the lies of Spain,'' and in
his sole court appearance he told a British judge he did not
recognize the judge's authority.

HOUSE VOTES TO LIMIT STEEL IMPORTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: 2nd take is scheduled to move by 8:30 p.m. ET) 
(sw) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House voted decisively on Wednesday to limit
steel imports, ignoring opposition from the Republican leadership
and a White House warning that the measure would violate world
trade agreements.
</P>
<P>
   The 289-141 vote _ one short of the two-thirds margin needed to
override a presidential veto _ displayed the division in the
Democratic Party over President Clinton's free trade policies as
well as the draw of protectionism to Republicans from the Rust
Belt. All but 13 of the House Democrats deserted the
administration. And 91 Republicans, a surprisingly strong number,
also bolted from their party's traditional free-trade position.
</P>
<P>
   The bill _ the first major trade measure of the congressional
session _ directs the United States to limit steel imports from
other nations to their average monthly volume for the three-year
period ending July 1997. It would be up to the administration to
decide whether to do so through quotas, tariffs or voluntary
agreements.
</P>
<P>
   The day's debate and off-stage lobbying showed the strange
coalitions that have developed over trade policy and the growth in
protectionist sentiments. When a measure to give the president
broader powers to negotiate trade deals was defeated last year, 71
Republicans voted against it. In this instance, 20 more Republicans
took a stand against unfettered free trade. Steel and fast-track
trade negotiations are the two targets of protectionists lobbying.
</P>
<P>
   With worldwide demand hurt by Asia's financial crisis, foreign
steel makers have been selling at below-market levels. The American
steel industry has seen a drop in business while imports rose 33
percent in 1998 before they began to subside in December. The
Clinton administration last month announced that it would impose
anti-dumping tariffs to punish Japan and Brazil and negotiated an
agreement with Russia to limit imports.
</P>
<P>
   The stricter limits passed by the House are unlikely to become
law. The bill's fate in the Senate is uncertain, but a presidential
veto is likely. In a letter to the House, the White House chief of
staff, John Podesta, acknowledged the steel crisis but warned that
the measure ``constitutes a violation of our international
obligations'' under the World Trade Organization and ``is not in
our nation's economic interest.'' He said Clinton's senior advisers
would recommend that he veto the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the vote showed how difficult, if not impossible, it will
be to pass in this Congress a long sought measure, known as
``fast-track,'' to give the president sweeping powers to negotiate
new trade agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dennis Hastert of Illinois, the speaker of the House, also
opposed the bill as a violation of free trade. But the bill's
supporters had enough backing to likely be able to force a vote,
and he let the measure come to the floor. His spokesman, John P.
Feehery, said that some Republicans ``were pushing very strongly
for a debate, and we also wanted to avoid the other parliamentary
shenanigans.'' The House Ways and Means Committee, strongly in
favor of free trade, reported the bill to the floor with the
recommendation that it be defeated.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Buchanan, the Republican presidential contender who has
challenged the party establishment, wrote to House Republicans on
Tuesday urging them to support the bill to ``regain the loyalty of
working Americans.'' And Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri, the
minority leader, despite his recent endorsement of Vice President
Al Gore, spoke out in favor of the bill, giving a hint of the
debate that might have been if he had run for president.

ANALYSIS: CLINTON JOINS THE `STAR WARS' PARADE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich., Va.)  (See also MISSILE-DEFENSE) 
(mk) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton White House seldom lets a popular
parade pass by without leaping to the front, or at least latching
onto the last carriage. In years past, President Clinton was a late
but fervent convert to Republican crusades on the balanced budget,
IRS abuses and a federal law discouraging same-sex marriages.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has once again joined a popular cause, this time
national missile defense, the latest version of the much-derided
``Star Wars'' anti-missile program of the Reagan era. Clinton added
$6.6 billion for missile defense to his Pentagon budget request in
January and this week dropped his opposition to a bill he had
threatened to veto.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton on Tuesday abruptly withdrew his objections to a
Republican-sponsored Senate bill calling for the development of a
limited missile defense system. He did so after Democrats drafted
two face-saving amendments that allowed the White House to assert
that the bill would not jeopardize arms deals with Russia or commit
the United States to building an untested system.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Wednesday passed the measure 97-3.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials were too modest to claim victory. The
chief sentiment was relief at having at least partly defused what
could have become a potent political issue next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got the best deal we could,'' a senior White House aide
said on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   But even with the president's late change of heart on missile
defense, Republicans were likely to seize on the issue as a
fundamental philosophical difference with Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show that the public finds Democrats more credible on
domestic social issues like education and Social Security. But
Republicans retain their lead on foreign policy and defense, and
Republican leaders in Congress have declared that they intend to
highlight differences with Democrats on national security over the
next two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could call this `How the Right Won the Missile Defense
Debate,''' said Joseph Cirincione, a senior analyst at the Carnegie
Endowment for International Peace and a missile defense skeptic.
``Presidential politics and procurement dollars won the day. The
White House just didn't want to let the Republicans get to the
right of them in the national security debate.''
</P>
<P>
   Cirincione said that the Senate action Wednesday, and likely
approval of a similar measure in the House on Thursday, meant that
development of some system to try to intercept incoming ballistic
missiles was all but certain over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The administration may not realize how powerful money is in
defense politics,'' he said. ``When you put this kind of cash on
the table, it becomes a force of nature.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said Clinton was swayed by more than
public opinion, which has always looked favorably on some form of
missile defense. Clinton and Democrats in Congress began to temper
their opposition to developing a missile defense system after North
Korea last August tested a three-stage ballistic missile with
enough range to hit U.S. troops in Asia and potentially to reach
North America.
</P>
<P>
   Also last year, a bipartisan commission chaired by Donald
Rumsfeld, a Republican and a former secretary of defense, warned
that North Korea, Iran or Iraq could potentially hit targets in
America with ballistic missiles by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   In addition last year, the CIA issued a new warning that the
threat of a missile attack on the United States was growing, while
China continued to test increasingly sophisticated long-range
missiles.
</P>
<P>
   These developments clearly put the White House on the defensive.
</P>
<P>
   The administration responded by increasing spending for missile
defense research and, in January, notifying Russia that it might
seek to amend the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty of 1972 to allow
deployment of a missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
   ``They felt they needed to shift position and give ground to
avoid being swamped by political critics on the right, as well as
by more centrist people in their own party and nonpartisan
experts,'' said Robert Zoellick, president of the Center for
Strategic and International Studies in Washington and an
undersecretary of state in the Bush administration. ``I'm a little
skeptical myself of the sincerity of their conversion.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials and Democrats in the Senate denied that
they flipped on the issue to deny Republicans a political platform
plank. Instead, they said, the growing threat of a missile attack
by a rogue state and promising technological developments persuaded
them to support aggressive research on missile defense. Having
ceded that ground, they fought a holding action on the ABM treaty
in hopes of keeping Moscow at the arms control table.
</P>
<P>
   Russian leaders have denounced the administration's intention to
seek amendments to the treaty. Critics in Washington and Moscow
assert that this week's votes in Congress could jeopardize Russian
ratification of the START 2 arms reduction agreement and Moscow's
willingness to negotiate more nuclear arms cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., said Wednesday that he agreed to
support the missile defense bill only after an amendment was
approved to reassure the Russians that the United States would not
unilaterally withdraw from the ABM treaty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key issue to me, the one I put so much time on, was what
is the effect of this policy on nuclear arms reductions,'' Levin
said in an interview. ``That to me was the big gorilla. Without
that amendment I was going to vote against it, and I thought we
could sustain a veto.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Warner, R-Va., chairman of the Armed Services
Committee, said that Clinton and his Democratic allies in Congress

GOVERNOR ALL STEAMED UP OVER LACK OF STADIUM SITE PROGRESS

<P>
   HARTFORD, Mass. _ Connecticut Governor John G. Rowland is
threatening to tear down the steam plant on the proposed site of
the New England Patriots stadium here because negotiations to move
the plant voluntarily are at an impasse.
</P>
<P>
   Visibly frustrated at a news conference in his Capitol office
Wednesday, Rowland also backed away from the prospect of meeting
the April 2 deadline when the state must convince team owner Robert
Kraft that plant can be moved in time to start construction of the
stadium in the summer of 2000. Under his agreement with the state,
Kraft can back out of the $375 million deal if the deadline is not
met.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland's remarks were the strongest indication so far that the
Patriots' move to Hartford could be derailed despite his
administration's determination to lure the team from Foxborough,
Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in worse shape now in negotiations than we were when we
began,'' was Rowland's bleak assessment.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft, reached at the NFL owners meetings in Phoenix, declined
to say what would happen if the state failed to make the deadline.
``We'll have to see what happens in April,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If there is no resolution, bulldozing the plant appears to be
Rowland's only viable alternative, since no other site in the city
has been considered. The governor said he would be required to give
the plant's owner about one year's notice before taking the land by
eminent domain. He insisted that such a move would not delay the
project because legal issues could be handled after the site was
cleared.
</P>
<P>
   ``The long drawn out battle happens after the fact,'' Rowland
said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the setback in Hartford, there are no signs Kraft or
state legislators are reviving talks to keep the team in
Massachusetts by using state money to help renovate or rebuild
Foxboro Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Under Kraft's deal with Connecticut, considered the most
lucrative of any NFL stadium accord, the state will build the
stadium and give the team a big share of the revenue it generates.
In return, Kraft will invest about $75 million for a new hotel, an
NFL retail center, and a wellness and fitness center at Adriaen's
Landing, a $1 billion development project in Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   Moving the steam plant, which heats and cools many Hartford
office buildings, is the key obstacle Rowland needs to overcome to
make the Patriots deal a reality.
</P>
<P>
   The seriousness of the problem became apparent last week when
talks between CTG Resources Inc., the company that owns the steam
plant, and a quasi-public agency trying to relocate the facility
broke down. Meanwhile, CTG officials threw environmental engineers
off the site.
</P>
<P>
   In an angry letter dated March 9 obtained by the Globe,
Rowland's outside mediator wrote CTG chief executive Arthur
Marquardt, saying the company's request for $48.8 million to move
just its offices _ not including the steam plant _ was so expensive
that potential financiers dismissed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apparently, after a review of the cost of the relocation, two
potential corporate sponsors and two banks have indicated that
$48.8 million is far in excess of the amount they could reasonably
commit to the project,'' mediator Richard Gray wrote. ``The maximum
amount that could be raised for the relocation of the
Administration and Operations building is in the $25 million
range.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither side spoke again until Tuesday, when Rowland personally
appealed to Marquardt, calling the executive to his office to break
the stalemate. That meeting produce no deal.
</P>
<P>
   Still reeling Wednesday, Rowland said CTG's corporate facility
on the site was worth between $12 million and $15 million and the
plant was valued at about $40 million. The cost to clean up the
contaminated location along the Connecticut River is close to $25
million, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if CTG was being greedy, the governor said, ``I'd like to
believe they have a lot of smart ivnestment attorneys around them
who are saying, `Hey, let's go for the gold.' I'm saying don't go
for the gold. You can go for the bronze or the silver.''
</P>
<P>
   During his meeting with Marquardt, a source said Rowland fumed
about the engineers being ushered off the site, part of the
long-planned $1 billion downtown revitalization project known as
Adriaen's Landing.
</P>
<P>
   ``CTG started out as a partner over the last year or so. They've
been to the bill signing, the ribbon cuttings, the press
announcements...and everything that's gone on over the last two
years was done with the full support of CTG, fully knowing and
understanding that that was the location and that was the site.''
</P>
<P>
   No other location is being considered, Rowland added.
</P>
<P>
   With the April 2 deadline looming, the governor asked Gray to go
back to the table as soon as Thursday with Marquardt, who, in turn,
reportedly promised to allow engineers back on the site.
</P>
<P>
   Marquardt could not be reached for comment and a CTG spokesman
did not return calls.
</P>
<P>
   However, Rowland's spokesman, Dean Pagani, tried to inject a
sense of flexibility with the April 2 deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost every milestone in this project has gone right down to
the wire or beyond,'' Pagani said. ``It's not as if the deal has to
be completely done...it's just a status report'' that must be given
to the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   But the detailed development agreement between Kraft and the
state says in no uncertain terms that if the team is not convinced
that the site can be cleared in time for construction to begin by
the summer of 2000 than the Patriots can walk away.

 &HT;    Rich `Legacy' thrives through black colleges
 &HT;    By Catherine Fox
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Museum directors like to tout their exhibitions, but
Kinshasha Holman Conwill is hardly overstating her case when she
calls the Studio Museum in Harlem's new show a ``revelation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To Conserve a Legacy: American Art From Historically Black
Colleges and Universities,'' which opened Wednesday, brings
together 175 works selected from the collections of six colleges,
including Clark Atlanta University.
</P>
<P>
   The very existence of these collections will be a surprise to
many people, and yet, until very recently, the schools served as
the primary patrons for black artists denied access to the
mainstream art world.
</P>
<P>
   ``This show presents American art through an African-American
lens,'' said co-curator Richard Powell, chairman of Duke
University's art and art history department.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, for every famous artist such as Elizabeth
Catlett or Romare Bearden, there's a name you don't know, an artist
whose work might have disappeared but for the support of these
institutions. Works by white and Native American artists from the
collections are also included, though they are in the minority.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a show about discovery,'' said Powell, who worked with
Jock Reynolds, director of the Yale Art Gallery. ``I was, for
example, surprised at how many African-American abstractionists
there were.''
</P>
<P>
   The show will travel to seven cities after closing here July 11.
CAU and the High Museum of Art will co-host the Atlanta stop in
June 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Co-sponsored by the Studio Museum and the Addison Gallery of
American Art at Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass., ``Legacy'' is
also concerned with conservation. Experts at the Williamstown
(Mass.) Art Conservation Center restored 1,400 works _ more than
will be exhibited _ belonging to the participating schools. In an
effort to encourage minority participation in the conservation
field, students from each of the six schools represented served as
interns at the conservation center.
</P>
<P>
   A hefty catalog (MIT Press, $60) documents the project and the
conservation efforts, and each of the works was researched, some by
rising African-American scholars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see this as a great boost to the institutions,'' said Tina
Dunkley, director of the Clark Atlanta University Galleries. ``It's
also a thrill to see all of this work together. I think the show is
a work of art in itself.''

 COM18-COX &HT;    Crips, Bloods hailed on the Web: The gangs all here
 &HT;    By Lyle V. Harris
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Visitors to the FlyPlaya Web site will see the words
``C'z Up,'' a greeting used by the Crips, an infamous street gang.
Scrolling down, visitors can view pictures of slain rapper Tupac
Shakur, animated marijuana leaves and an insulting reference to
``slobs'' _ Crips slang for the Bloods, their archrivals.
</P>
<P>
   The creator of the site, Atlanta resident Kris Lester _ ``Shawty
K'' on the Web _ insists she's not a real Crip. She maintains she's
just a virtual gangsta, part of a small group of computer users who
identify with the underground chic of gang life, but who have more
experience firing up PCs than firing Uzis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is just a way for me to associate with Crips from
all over the country and the world,'' Lester said by way of e-mail,
in answer to a request to be interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Lester has latched on to a real subcurrent on the Web.
Just like baggy, jailhouse-style jeans and gangsta rap,
Web-disseminated images of gang life have attracted a following.
It's impossible to tell how many aficionados are genuine gang
members and how many are simply drawn by the cachet of the ``thug
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Lester declined to discuss her Crip-obsessed Web site further,
fearing she might ``get arrested for trying to get people to join a
gang.'' And she may have good reason to be concerned.
</P>
<P>
   This week, a group of Fayette County teenagers, who had dubbed
themselves the Rollin' 5 Crackas, were charged with ``tagging'' a
bridge with spray paint and attempting to recruit gang members with
their Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Their Web site has been shut down, and the father of one of the
teens claims the gang was ``a joke.'' But the Fayette County
Sheriff's Office missed the punch line.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kids claimed to be a spin-off of the Crips,'' said Maj.
Bruce Jordan of the sheriff's department. ``I don't know if they're
for real, but everybody is jumping on the information highway.
There's no doubt in my mind that real gangs are doing it also.''
</P>
<P>
   Gang presence on the web can be traced in large part to Dirk
Lemmons, a 41-year-old former accountant from rural Missouri, who
is webmaster for two websites: www.crips.com and www.bloods.com, a
growing cyber-network of what appear to be real-life gang-bangers
and wannabes.
</P>
<P>
   Working from his family farm near Branson, Lemmons has been
helping gang devotees who want to get their homepages on the
Internet, including Lester's Atlanta-based Crips site.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the websites are crude. They typically include pictures
of souped-up cars, a chronology of the gang's origins and
descriptions of their favorite automatic weapons. A common feature
is a computer-generated Cadillac with the words ``Pimp Mail,''
which users click to send e-mail. Many of the images on the sites
are disturbing _ one link takes visitors to gory autopsy photo of
Shakur.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the sites list the names and members of purported
gangs in the Atlanta area, such as the East Point Crips and the
Coweta County Crips.
</P>
<P>
   Lemmons says he gets about 50,000 hits to his site daily, most
of which he speculates are generated from young gang poseurs more
likely to be grounded by their parents than arrested by the police.
</P>
<P>
   He claims his sites have a law-and-order motive: to show the
scary reality of gang life. ``It's like taking a kid for a visit to
prison to scare the snot out of them,'' Lemmons said in a telephone
interview. ``We're trying to scare kids into seeing what gang life
can do to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, if the aim is to discourage gang members, the message is
subtle, and easily lost among the pictures of kids giving gang
signs and e-mails dissing rivals. Following the arrests in Fayette
County, Lemmons pulled the sites off his server for several days,
fearing that he also might be accused of trying to lure people into
gangs.
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Jordan of Fayette said he's never heard of Lemmons, and
doubts his department would be interested in his activities. But
Detective Chuck Zeglin, a gang specialist with the Los Angeles
Police Department, has surfed some of the sites Lemmons helped
create.
</P>
<P>
   Zeglin, though, doubts virtual gangstas are much of a threat to
the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think about 10 percent are gang members, the rest are
probably phonies and wannabes,'' Zeglin said. ``Out here, gang
members are street thugs with no education, broken families and are
not computer-literate.''
</P>
<P>
   Lemmons argues that gang members are more Internet-savvy than
Zeglin believes, and even if they don't have computers at home,
they do have access. His can trace the location of his users, and
most of them are turning up at schools and public libraries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a misconception to think that a gang-banger can't use a
computer,'' Lemmons said, ``and just about any kid knows how to get
on the Internet.''

 WASHINGTON: for president.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Organized labor was also working hard for the bill, and the
United Steelworkers had several hundred rank-and-file members on
hand for the final push.
</P>
<P>
   ``An economic collapse has swept the globe,'' Gephardt said,
``first striking Asia, but now impacting Latin America and other
developing countries as well. During the debate over IMF emergency
funding to stabilize these economies, I warned that import surges
would result from the Asian economic crisis and that a plan needed
to be in place to combat unfair imports. Unfortunately, no such
plan was forthcoming.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that 10,000 steel jobs had been lost to the import
surge. ``Our steel industry is the most productive in the world.
The U.S. should not be forced to unilaterally take in a massive
global import surge.''
</P>
<P>
   Several senior Republicans argued against the bill, which was
sponsored by Rep. Pete Visclosky, D-Ind. They contended that the
American economy was thriving because of the new markets provided
by international trade. They also said the limits could hurt other
U.S. manufacturers by raising steel prices and cutting off the
supply of specialized steel products only available through
imports.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Archer, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee,
said that the president and his advisers had studied the steel
situation and chose not to set quotas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president's logic is clear,'' Archer, R-Texas, said. ``if
the U.S. were to set up trade barriers now in our fragile world
economy, we could have a much bigger problem on our hands that
would affect thousands more American jobs and threaten our economy.
In addition, we would set a terrible example for countries in real
economic trouble, countries whose leaders are under tremendous
pressure to retaliate against American-made products.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rust-belt Republicans as well as Democrats, took the side of
the steelworkers and steel industry. ``We're going to stand up for
Main Street today, not Wall Street,'' said Rep. Robert Ney, R-Ohio.
``That's why this bill is here. We're here because thousands of
steelworkers and citizens would not let this issue go, would not
let this issue die.''
</P>
<P>
   The limits in the House bill would reduce steel imports by 12
million tons from the levels of 1998, while still allowing about 29
million tons of steel into the country. At the height of the steel
import surge in 1998, 41 million tons of foreign steel was being
imported.
</P>
<P>
   The administration argued that the bill violated U.S.
obligations to the World Trade Organization because it would impose
a global limit on imports, instead of using allowed tools such as
tariffs to fight illegal dumping of imports.
</P>
<P>
   But confronted with the vote, Charlene Barshevsky, the U.S.
trade representative, said: ``While we oppose this legislation, we
are going to work with the Congress to address this issue.'' The
administration hopes eventually this session to muster support for
an alternate approach to the steel crisis and to support a bill
sponsored by Reps. Carl Levin, D-Mich., and Amo Houghton, R-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Their measure would change the trade law to make it easier and
quicker for the administration to take action in cases of import
surges.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Having floated some 20,000 miles over Europe, Africa, Asia, the
Pacific Ocean and Central America, the Breitling Orbiter 3 headed
into the home stretch over the Atlantic Ocean Wednesday in its bid
to become the first balloon to circle the world nonstop.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect that the Breitling's crew, Bertrand Piccard and
Brian Jones, may succeed where all others have failed seemed more
promising with each passing hour.
</P>
<P>
   The Breitling ground team in Geneva forecast that the huge
Swiss-registered balloon would complete its circuit of the Earth on
Saturday, somewhere in North Africa.
</P>
<P>
   As the Breitling balloon entered its 18th day aloft, however,
the two pilots were complaining of exhaustion and said they were
worried that the propane used in the balloon's burners might run
out before the craft reached the finish line: 9.27 degrees west
longitude.
</P>
<P>
   But the team spokeswoman in Geneva, Monika Pieren, said in a
telephone interview Wednesday that if wind directions and speeds
correspond to the meteorological forecasts, the balloon would have
enough propane to safely reach Mauritania and the goal line before
fuel runs out.
</P>
<P>
   The balloonists will try to avoid landing in Algeria or Libya,
where they are uncertain of the political climate. A ditching at
sea has not been ruled out.
</P>
<P>
   When the balloon took off from Chateau-d'Oex, Switzerland, it
initially flew southwestward, reaching 9.27 degrees west longitude
before catching a favorable jet stream and heading eastward around
the world. Thus, 9.27 degrees west longitude represents the finish
line.
</P>
<P>
   If the Breitling team makes it, they will enter the record books
as winners of the last great goal of ballooning. Many have tried
before them but all have fallen far short, including the roughly 20
attempts made during the last decade alone. Only last week a
British balloon, the Cable &AMP; Wireless, was forced to end a
round-the-world attempt, ditching in the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Piccard, a Swiss psychiatrist, and his co-pilot, Brian Jones, a
52-year-old British balloonist, stand to win a $1 million prize and
cup from Anheuser-Busch, the brewing company.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago the company offered the prize and a trophy, the
Budweiser Cup, to the first balloonist to circle the world nonstop.
Gregory Hendricks, a Budweiser spokesman, said Wednesday the
challenge remained in effect, and, he added: ``We're wishing good
luck to the Breitling crew.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Breitling balloon faced staggering problems to get this far.
Besides the vagaries of wind direction and speed, there were storms
to avoid and regions of dead air where the balloon might have
become stuck until fuel ran out.
</P>
<P>
   There were many technical problems, including the accumulation
of ice on the propane burners. Worst of all, some of the nations
along the round-the-world track did not open their airspace to
balloons and had to be avoided. China gave last-minute permission,
but only on condition that the balloon remain south of the 26th
parallel.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the balloon crawled at 20 miles an hour, but in
stretches where the crew could exploit jet streams, the Breitling
sped at more than 100 miles an hour. On two occasions, prompted
partly by the need to scrape ice off burners and partly to escape
the bad-smelling air inside the crew capsule, the balloonists
ventured outside their pressurized crew compartment into the
frigid, thin air above 20,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Piccard reported that he and Jones had been having
trouble sleeping. In his psychiatric work Piccard frequently uses
hypnosis and is adept at hypnotizing himself to fall asleep. But
the technique apparently failed during the last few exhausting
days. &QL;

 &HT;    Small investors offered a multitude of advice

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Whether the Dow Jones industrial average trades at or
above 10,000 is probably a remote issue for most small investors.
They're more interested in advice on how to pick stock and mutual
funds _ advice the business press gladly provides.
</P>
<P>
   _ Money (April) cautions small investors against ``betting the
ranch'' on S&AMP;P 500 index funds, since they expose you ``to more
risk than you probably realize.''
</P>

   Unmanaged index funds are tied to a stock index such as the S&AMP;P

NEWS ANALYSIS: COMPLEX AND POLITICAL, MEDICARE DEFIES A QUICK FIX
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Ira C. Magaziner, the politically tone-deaf
architect of President Clinton's ill-fated health plan, and Sen.
John Breaux, D-La., the deal-making chairman of a commission that
failed to find a solution to Medicare's financial woes, share what
might be called the hubris of health care reformers: the belief
that they could devise an all-encompassing scheme to redesign a
huge swath of America's health care system.
</P>
<P>
   Both failed spectacularly. Their efforts suggest that piecemeal,
incremental changes are the only ones feasible at the moment, given
the political and technical complexity of the subject.
</P>
<P>
   After a year of work, the 17-member Medicare commission expired
on Tuesday, one vote short of the 11 needed to endorse any formal
recommendations to Congress or the president. Breaux said he would
continue his effort to inject free-market competition into
Medicare, and even a harsh critic of the plan, Sen. John D.
Rockefeller, D-W.Va., said Wednesday that some version of it might
eventually ``land on the president's desk.''
</P>
<P>
   Breaux's proposal for Medicare and Magaziner's scheme for the
entire health care system were both built on the idea of ``managed
competition'': that the government would set rules for private
health plans to compete for business, in the hope that they would
offer more benefits and higher-quality care at lower prices. Health
maintenance organizations would compete against traditional health
insurance plans, which pay a fixed fee for each service.
</P>
<P>
   Breaux and Magaziner would both have offered new benefits,
including prescription drug coverage, while creating strong
incentives for subscribers to choose lower-cost health plans.
</P>
<P>
   The failure of these efforts suggests once again the difficulty,
maybe even the futility, of comprehensive proposals to overhaul the
way health care is financed and delivered. The technical substance
of health policy and the politics of the issue are so complex that
they frustrate such ambitious efforts.
</P>
<P>
   But the complexity of health care and the rapid pace of medical
discoveries also make it difficult for government to regulate this
market.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is absolutely impossible to micro-manage health care in the
21st century'' as Congress has required, Breaux said, noting that
Medicare uses many convoluted formulas to pay doctors, hospitals,
nursing homes, HMOs and home health care agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The promise of simplicity is one reason for the appeal of the
plan that Breaux drafted with help from Rep. Bill Thomas of
California, the leading Republican on the commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are at least 10,000 Medicare reimbursement codes for
hospital and physician services, and there are more than 3,000
counties in the United States,'' said Len M. Nichols, a health care
economist at the Urban Institute. ``It's very difficult for
Medicare to get 10,000 prices right in 3,000 counties. It would be
simpler for the government to learn how to pay the right price for
a package of services. The Breaux plan promised to move in that
direction, but it didn't specify enough details to engender a
consensus that we were ready to move now.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the Breaux-Thomas plan say it will use the magic
of the market to save money, encouraging greater efficiency among
providers of health care. ``The market can accomplish very good
things,'' said Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., a commission member.
</P>
<P>
   But anyone who thinks federal regulation would vanish under
Breaux's plan is dreaming. Breaux would create a powerful new
government agency, the Medicare Board. The board would negotiate
with health plans, approve their benefits, determine the federal
payment to each plan and compute the premiums charged to
beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   For those who want to redesign Medicare, the thorniest issue is
how to provide a new prescription drug benefit. Of the 39 million
Medicare beneficiaries, more than 6 million are in HMOs, and most
of these HMOs already offer drug benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats in Congress say drug coverage must also be available
to people in the original fee-for-service Medicare program. But
that makes drug companies nervous because it raises the possibility
that Medicare would regulate drug prices, just as it regulates what
doctors charge Medicare patients. Judith H. Bello, executive vice
president of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of
America, said that to date she had not seen any proposal for drug
coverage that relied adequately on the market.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare costs are growing faster than the program's revenues,
and the gap will widen as baby boomers become eligible for Medicare
after 2010. But Congress usually responds only to pressing
problems, and Medicare's financial troubles seem less urgent today
than in 1997, when Congress created the Medicare commission.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare spending rose last year just 1.5 percent, the smallest
increase since the beginning of the program in 1965. Nancy-Ann Min
DeParle, the head of the Medicare program, said this was ``probably
an aberration,'' reflecting a decline in the use of home health
care and a reduction in fraud and abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, Breaux and many Republicans are talking about
comprehensive changes in the structure of Medicare. But Congress
will have its hands full fixing the law it passed in 1997. That law
was intended to create new health insurance options for the elderly
and to entice more HMOs into the Medicare market, under a new
program known as Medicare+Choice.
</P>
<P>
   Many HMOs unexpectedly pulled out of Medicare or reduced their
service areas, causing confusion and alarm for more than 440,000
beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing that he would offer his own proposal to revamp
Medicare, Clinton said: ``We must find agreement this year.
Medicare is too important to let partisan politics stand in the way
of vital progress.''
</P>
<P>
   The outlook for action is unclear, but one thing is certain.
Politics will pervade the debate. It could be no other way in a
program that spends more than $200 billion a year to care for 39
million people.

GOVERNOR ALL STEAMED UP OVER LACK OF STADIUM SITE PROGRESS 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Mass. _ Connecticut Governor John G. Rowland is
threatening to tear down the steam plant on the proposed site of
the New England Patriots stadium here because negotiations to move
the plant voluntarily are at an impasse.
</P>
<P>
   Visibly frustrated at a news conference in his Capitol office
Wednesday, Rowland also backed away from the prospect of meeting
the April 2 deadline when the state must convince team owner Robert
Kraft that plant can be moved in time to start construction of the
stadium in the summer of 2000. Under his agreement with the state,
Kraft can back out of the $375 million deal if the deadline is not
met.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland's remarks were the strongest indication so far that the
Patriots' move to Hartford could be derailed despite his
administration's determination to lure the team from Foxborough,
Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in worse shape now in negotiations than we were when we
began,'' was Rowland's bleak assessment.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft, reached at the NFL owners meetings in Phoenix, declined
to say what would happen if the state failed to make the deadline.
``We'll have to see what happens in April,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If there is no resolution, bulldozing the plant appears to be
Rowland's only viable alternative, since no other site in the city
has been considered. The governor said he would be required to give
the plant's owner about one year's notice before taking the land by
eminent domain. He insisted that such a move would not delay the
project because legal issues could be handled after the site was
cleared.
</P>
<P>
   ``The long drawn out battle happens after the fact,'' Rowland
said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the setback in Hartford, there are no signs Kraft or
state legislators are reviving talks to keep the team in
Massachusetts by using state money to help renovate or rebuild
Foxboro Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Under Kraft's deal with Connecticut, considered the most
lucrative of any NFL stadium accord, the state will build the
stadium and give the team a big share of the revenue it generates.
In return, Kraft will invest about $75 million for a new hotel, an
NFL retail center, and a wellness and fitness center at Adriaen's
Landing, a $1 billion development project in Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   Moving the steam plant, which heats and cools many Hartford
office buildings, is the key obstacle Rowland needs to overcome to
make the Patriots deal a reality.
</P>
<P>
   The seriousness of the problem became apparent last week when
talks between CTG Resources Inc., the company that owns the steam
plant, and a quasi-public agency trying to relocate the facility
broke down. Meanwhile, CTG officials threw environmental engineers
off the site.
</P>
<P>
   In an angry letter dated March 9 obtained by the Globe,
Rowland's outside mediator wrote CTG chief executive Arthur
Marquardt, saying the company's request for $48.8 million to move
just its offices _ not including the steam plant _ was so expensive
that potential financiers dismissed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apparently, after a review of the cost of the relocation, two
potential corporate sponsors and two banks have indicated that
$48.8 million is far in excess of the amount they could reasonably
commit to the project,'' mediator Richard Gray wrote. ``The maximum
amount that could be raised for the relocation of the
Administration and Operations building is in the $25 million
range.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither side spoke again until Tuesday, when Rowland personally
appealed to Marquardt, calling the executive to his office to break
the stalemate. That meeting produce no deal.
</P>
<P>
   Still reeling Wednesday, Rowland said CTG's corporate facility
on the site was worth between $12 million and $15 million and the
plant was valued at about $40 million. The cost to clean up the
contaminated location along the Connecticut River is close to $25
million, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if CTG was being greedy, the governor said, ``I'd like to
believe they have a lot of smart ivnestment attorneys around them
who are saying, `Hey, let's go for the gold.' I'm saying don't go
for the gold. You can go for the bronze or the silver.''
</P>
<P>
   During his meeting with Marquardt, a source said Rowland fumed
about the engineers being ushered off the site, part of the
long-planned $1 billion downtown revitalization project known as
Adriaen's Landing.
</P>
<P>
   ``CTG started out as a partner over the last year or so. They've
been to the bill signing, the ribbon cuttings, the press
announcements...and everything that's gone on over the last two
years was done with the full support of CTG, fully knowing and
understanding that that was the location and that was the site.''
</P>
<P>
   No other location is being considered, Rowland added.
</P>
<P>
   With the April 2 deadline looming, the governor asked Gray to go
back to the table as soon as Thursday with Marquardt, who, in turn,
reportedly promised to allow engineers back on the site.
</P>
<P>
   Marquardt could not be reached for comment and a CTG spokesman
did not return calls.
</P>
<P>
   However, Rowland's spokesman, Dean Pagani, tried to inject a
sense of flexibility with the April 2 deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost every milestone in this project has gone right down to
the wire or beyond,'' Pagani said. ``It's not as if the deal has to
be completely done...it's just a status report'' that must be given
to the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   But the detailed development agreement between Kraft and the
state says in no uncertain terms that if the team is not convinced
that the site can be cleared in time for construction to begin by
the summer of 2000 than the Patriots can walk away.

2 LATE ISRAELI LEADERS, 2 GRAND MUSEUMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By WILLIAM A. ORME Jr.  
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ In what will inevitably be seen as competing
memorials, the families and allies of Yitzhak Rabin and Menachem
Begin are raising millions of dollars to build museum-scale centers
to honor the late prime ministers.
</P>
<P>
   In New York and Washington this week, Rabin's wife, Leah, is
starting a $30 million fund-raising drive for the planned Yitzhak
Rabin Center for Israel Studies. It would be modeled after what she
called ``the grand tradition of American presidential libraries.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Mrs. Rabin, her children and granddaughter will be
received at the White House by President Clinton and Hillary Rodham
Clinton, whose friendship with the Rabins is to be highlighted at
the center.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Thursday, in Jerusalem, the governing board of the
planned Menachem Begin Heritage Center will hold its first meeting,
with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expected to attend. The
board will review plans to start construction in the fall of the
privately financed $14 million building. It, too, has been
consciously patterned after American presidential libraries.
</P>
<P>
   Years after their deaths, the two former prime ministers still
represent the governing poles of Israeli politics. Making the
issues especially charged, both projects are advancing during a
bitter election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I had in mind was something like the Kennedy Library at
Harvard,'' said Rabin's daughter, Dalia Rabin-Pelossof, a driving
force behind the Rabin center. ``My father's assassination should
be remembered in Israel for national reasons, not for political
reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   The center would be built in the modern heart of Tel Aviv, where
Rabin lived for most of his adult life and where, in 1995, he was
the victim of an Israeli assassin opposed to his peace pact with
the Palestinians. Tel Aviv is also the heartland of the staunchly
secular Labor rank and file, for whom Rabin remains an inspiring
party symbol.
</P>
<P>
   The Begin Center, by contrast, would be on a hillside that
overlooks Mount Zion and the ancient walls of Jerusalem, the city
Begin built into the national political base for his right-wing
Likud party. In a controversial ruling to forgive taxes,
Netanyahu's Likud government let the private foundation of the
center acquire the site at almost no cost.
</P>
<P>
   As with the Rabin center, the Begin memorial would contain
archives and artifacts from the prime minister's years in office, a
collection of writings by and about him and a headquarters for
planned educational projects.
</P>
<P>
   The Parliament voted to provide public funds for the annual
operating costs of both centers, estimated at $5 million yearly.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A presidential-style memorial in the American mold strikes some
Israelis as too grandiose, and too individualized, for a country
that has historically cultivated a collective and personally
austere leadership style.
</P>
<P>
   The prototype for a prime ministerial library is still David
Ben-Gurion's red-roofed kibbutz cottage in the Negev, a one-story
frame dwelling crammed with 5,000 worn volumes collected over his
lifetime. Later prime ministers have been honored after their
deaths with research archives, but not museum-scale memorials.
</P>
<P>
   More than $10 million has been raised from private Israeli
donors for the $25 million Rabin Center building and a $15 million
endowment, according to the family. The center is to feature a
research institute and a museum to commemorate Rabin's career and
response to his assassination.

 &HT;    Judge puts a lock on pro wrestler
 &HT;    By Mark Bixler
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A pro wrestler known as Big Poppa Pump dodged the big
house Wednesday but will have to spend 10 days in the Cherokee
County Jail.
</P>
<P>
   A judge also ordered Scott Carl Rechsteiner to pay $25,000 and
stay on probation for seven years after Rechsteiner pleaded guilty
to aggravated assault and making terroristic threats, felonies with
a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison. The charges allege that
Rechsteiner, 36, threatened a Department of Transportation worker
and hit him with his Ford F-250 pickup in April 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Rechsteiner has biceps the size of watermelons and a blond Fu
Manchu mustache. His lawyer, Alan C. Manheim, told Judge C. Michael
Roach that Rechsteiner is gentle and well-educated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have seen a man very different than his public persona,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Big Poppa Pump is one of the bad guys on the TV wrestling shows,
wrestling with the World Championship Wrestling federation as part
of the New World Order team.
</P>
<P>
   Last April 21, investigators said, Rechsteiner drove down a
closed exit ramp off I-575 in south Cherokee and threatened and
twice hit DOT road worker Paul Kaspereen after Kaspereen told him
the ramp was closed. Kaspereen was not seriously hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just apologize that this happened,'' said the wrestler, who
also goes by the name Scott Steiner.
</P>
<P>
   The judge sentenced Rechsteiner under the state's first-offender
rules. That means a court will find him not guilty if he avoids
trouble while on probation.
</P>
<P>
   The judge also ordered Rechsteiner to perform 200 hours of
community service.

`RAVENOUS' GETS KIND OF MESSY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use  Friday, March 19  by NYTimes News Service clients) 
Our rating: 2 1/2 stars 
By BOB STRAUSS  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
LOS ANGELES _ Just what the world needs: a western horror comedy
about cannibalism. With an agenda.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The best thing to be said about ``Ravenous'' is that it
acknowledges its own fundamental looniness. The movie may take its
sweet time to go over the top, and does so in a gorgeously, if
incongruous, pictorial manner. But when it does let loose, it's
with psychotic abandon.
</P>
<P>
   Like many mad follies, this one takes the longest time to reveal
just what is going on with it. At first, the film seems to be a
straightforward psychological study of military cowardice. We're
introduced to Capt. John Boyd (``L.A. Confidential's'' Guy Pearce),
who choked and played dead during a battle of the Mexican-American
War, then somehow found the gumption to single-handedly defeat an
enemy unit.
</P>
<P>
   Decorated but outed as a weak link _ his revulsion toward those
rare, juicy steaks the cavalry enjoys is a dead giveaway _ Boyd is
assigned to a woebegone mountain outpost in newly conquered
California. The snowbound stockade boasts a cynical, literate
commander (Jeffrey Jones), a religious fanatic (``Saving Private
Ryan's'' Jeremy Davies), a martinet supersoldier (Neal McDonough),
a drunken doc (Stephen Spinella) and a cook (David Arquette) who's
more interested in the medic's pharmacopeia than in his own spice
rack.
</P>
<P>
   We're well into the movie before this sad excuse for an outfit
is visited by a lost and starving Scottish pioneer, Colqhoun (``The
Full Monty's'' Robert Carlyle), one dark and sleeting night. He
tells a tragic tale of a settler band, forced by bad weather into a
cave and, eventually, preyed upon by their ghoulish guide. Colqhoun
claims to have escaped, and if he can bring enough men back to the
isolated cavern in time, a few starving, weak survivors might be
spared from the dinner plate.
</P>
<P>
   Colqhoun is not telling the whole story, however. That has to do
with a manifestation of the Indian myth of the Weendigo, in which a
man who eats another absorbs the victim's physical and spirit power
_ a kind of vampire effect with roughage. Members of the fort's
dwindling garrison soon face their own eat-or-be-eaten conundrums,
along with whether or not they should say a lot of bad, meat-based
puns.
</P>
<P>
   The director, Antonia Bird, is an English lefty who stirred up
some controversy with her earlier film, ``Priest.'' She tries to do
it again here, but writer Ted Griffin's attempts to link eating
people with America's western expansion are much sillier than they
are incendiary. About the only outcries that can be expected over
``Ravenous'' will be the usual complaints of gratuitous
gruesomeness.
</P>
<P>
   Performances are all over the Sierra Nevadas. Carlyle and Jones
get the joke and have vivid, wicked fun with their parts. Pearce
goes through dark-night-of-the-soul conniptions that seem way too
grave for such arch, fantastic material. For their parts, Davies
and Arquette lose their characters in snowdrifts of quirky Method
acting.
</P>
<P>
   And the whole enterprise, really, gets pulled and dismembered in
so many different genre directions that it never fully satisfies. &QL;

 &HT;    Texas senaors approve abortion notification bill
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Texas senators voted Wednesday to require
doctors to notify parents before performing abortions on minors,
but another bill requiring parental consent was pronounced all but
dead.
</P>
<P>
   After the 23-8 vote on her parental notification bill, Sen.
Florence Shapiro said she sees no chance of getting the 21 Senate
votes it would take to approve parental consent for abortions on
girls younger than 18.
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro (R-Plano) said seven senators have told her they are for
notification but could not support consent.
</P>
<P>
   The parental notification bill faces a final Senate vote,
probably today, that would send it to the House, where supporters
and opponents are predicting passage.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate approved a similar measure in 1997, only to see it
die in the House in a closing-days procedural move that scuttled
scores of bills.
</P>
<P>
   The House has never voted on a parental notification bill.
Shapiro, who characterized the bill as a parental rights issue and
noted that 39 other states have some form of parental notification,
She said the House version of it has 82 co-authors, more than
enough to guarantee approval if it gets to the floor. ``This is a
parental rights bill,'' Shapiro said. ``As legislators, we owe this
not only to the children of this state, but we owe it even more to
the parents of this state.''
</P>
<P>
   Kae McLaughlin, executive director of the Texas Abortion and
Reproductive Rights Action League, agreed that the bill has the
votes to pass. ``But anything can happen, and we hope it does.''
</P>
<P>
   McLaughlin said she also expected Wednesday's Senate outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``The closer it gets, I get more terrified for young Texas women
and for parents who think this bill somehow gives them safety when
in fact it jeopardizes their daughters' ability to seek legal and
safe abortion,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush and Lt. Gov. Rick Perry support both
measures.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a positive step to reduce the number of abortions in
Texas and involve parents in this major medical decision for their
minor daughters,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Perry pitched parental notification as a no-brainer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texans on all sides of this emotional issue can agree that
parents have the right to be involved in the major medical
decisions of their children,'' said Perry, who serves as Senate
president.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. John Whitmire (D-Houston) said the Shapiro bill will
cause great harm to girls and young women who will seek illegal,
potentially dangerous abortions, rather than allow their parents to
know about the pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not a thing 31 senators can do to prevent it,'' he
said. ``In fact, we're encouraging it through your legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro was unmoved by Whitmire's plea.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can do that today, and they are doing that today,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, 5,523 minors in Texas underwent abortions, according to
the Texas Department of Health. Thirty-nine percent of them did not
include a parent or legal guardian in their decisions, the agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio Sen. Jeff Wentworth, the only Republican who voted
against the bill, blasted it as nonsense.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some things in our society we are not capable of
passing laws here to solve,'' he said, agreeing with Whitmire's
prediction that the law will drive some young women to unsafe
abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Joining Wentworth and Whitmire in voting against the bill were
Democrats Gonzalo Barrientos of Austin, Rodney Ellis of Houston,
Mario Gallegos of Galena Park, Gregory Luna of San Antonio, Mike
Moncrief of Fort Worth and Eliot Shapleigh of El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   Under the bill, doctors must try to contact a parent or guardian
in person or by telephone. If the doctor is unsuccessful, he or she
must send a certified letter to the parent or guardian. No abortion
could be performed within 48 hours of the letter being sent. An
abortion can proceed after 48 hours even if the letter is not
delivered.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the debate involved bypass procedures that would protect
minors who are victims of incest or sexual abuse, or who feel they
cannot let a parent know they are seeking an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Shapiro bill, a pregnant minor could ask a judge in a
state district, county or probate court to allow the abortion to
proceed without parental notification. The hearing would be held in
private and the minor could use an alias in official court records,
which would be sealed.
</P>
<P>
   The judge would have to decide whether the minor is mature
enough and sufficiently well informed to make a decision on
abortion. In states with similar laws, 99 percent of the cases that
go to judges result in approval for abortion, according to Shapiro.
</P>
<P>
   Wentworth argued that the bypass procedure is backwards.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the court finds the minor is not mature I she has to become
a mother under this law,'' he said. ``I don't think that is very
good public policy.''

FRONTIER TO BE ACQUIRED BY GLOBAL CROSSING FOR $10.8 BILLION
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ala., Iowa, Wis.)   (rk) 
 By   SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Moving to gain a foothold in the United States, Global
Crossing &UR;  &LR; Ltd. of Bermuda, a new international communications
carrier, said Wednesday that it had agreed to acquire Frontier
Corp. for $10.8 billion in stock.
</P>
<P>
   Frontier, which from 1900 until 1995 was called Rochester
Telephone, serves almost 1 million local telephone customers in 13
states. Far more important from Global Crossing's point of view,
though, is that Frontier owns about one-third of an advanced fiber
optic communications network being built by Qwest Communications
International, the communications company controlled by Philip F.
Anschutz, the reclusive oil and railroad magnate.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Winnick, Global Crossing's founder and once an associate of
Michael R. Milken at Drexel Burnham Lambert, has raised more than
$4 billion for Global Crossing to build and operate undersea fiber
optic networks. But the company has lacked a significant presence
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Frontier's piece of the Qwest network may give Global Crossing a
lift in competing for corporate customers in the United States. It
could also help win business from American phone companies,
including the regional Bells, which may be looking for
long-distance partners to carry calls outside their regions.
</P>
<P>
   Just three weeks ago, Global Crossing hired as its chief
executive Robert Annunziata, who had briefly run AT&AMP;T Corp.'s
business services unit after selling his previous company, Teleport
Communications Group, to AT&AMP;T for more than $11 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Merging with Frontier will enable us to greatly accelerate our
aggressive growth strategy,'' Annunziata said in a statement
Wednesday. Referring to Internet protocol, he added, ``We will now
have a strong U.S. infrastructure to complement the IP-based fiber
network we are building in Europe, Japan, Mexico and Central and
South America.''
</P>
<P>
   Global Crossing has never said, however, that its strategic
plans include serving residential customers in places like
Monroeville, Ala., Mondovi, Wis., or Fort Dodge, Iowa, all small
towns served by Frontier's local phone operations. Global Crossing
said Wednesday that it was not planning to sell Frontier's local
units, but some analysts said it was unlikely Global Crossing would
retain them for long.
</P>
<P>
   It was those slow-growing local phone operations, in fact, that
helped make Frontier's stock a chronic underperformer for the
industry in the last few years, even after Joseph P. Clayton, a
former sales chief for Thomson Consumer Electronics, was hired as
chief executive in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the deal, Frontier's shareholders would get
$62 worth of Global Crossing stock for each of their shares. That
is almost 40 percent more than Frontier's closing share price
Tuesday of $44.625.
</P>
<P>
   Frontier's shares closed at $50.50 Wednesday, up $5.875, on the
New York Stock Exchange. Global Crossing's shares lost $4.375, to
close at $47.125, in Nasdaq trading.
</P>
<P>
   Frontier's shareholders could receive more or less than $62 a
share if the price of Global Crossing's stock changes drastically
before the deal is completed.
</P>
<P>
   If Global Crossing's shares move higher than $56.78, for
example, owners of Frontier stock are to receive 1.0919 shares of
Global Crossing for each of their Frontier shares. If Global
Crossing's stock falls below $34.56, Frontier stock owners will get
1.7939 shares of Global Crossing.
</P>
<P>
   Global Crossing also agreed to assume Frontier's debt of about
$1.3 billion.

 &HT;    Caucuses come out against Texas child insurance program
 &HT;    By Scott S. Greenberger
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A coalition of House lawmakers has pledged to
oppose a Senate compromise and push for a health insurance program
that would cover all children whose families make as much as twice
the federal poverty level.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the Mexican American Legislative Caucus, the Texas
Legislative Black Caucus and the Legislative Study Group, who
describe themselves as progressive lawmakers, said Wednesday that
they aren't satisfied with a Senate bill that would create a
Children's Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, that excludes older
children in families making more than 150 percent of the federal
poverty level.
</P>
<P>
   The three caucuses represent 74 of the 150 House members.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be wrong to arbitrarily exclude some children from
this program,'' said Rep. Kevin Bailey (D-Houston), who heads the
Legislative Study Group. ``Nothing we do this session will have a
greater impact on families and children in Texas than passing CHIP
for all children up to the 200 percent level.''
</P>
<P>
   CHIP would use federal and state money to insure children whose
families earn too much to qualify for Medicaid, the federal-state
health care program for the poor, but can't afford private health
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   About 1.4 million Texas children don't have health insurance,
and CHIP has nearly unanimous support. The question has been
whether it should cover children in households making as much as
200 percent of the federal poverty level or only those making 150
percent of that level. The federal poverty level for a family of
four is $16,450.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, the Senate approved a bill that would cover
children up to age 10 whose families make as much as twice the
poverty level. But children between 11 and 18 would initially be
covered only if their families make 150 percent or less of the
poverty standard.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Senate bill, the Health and Human Services Commission
would take a look at the program's enrollment every six months to
determine whether the state can afford to ratchet up the income
levels for older kids.
</P>
<P>
   The House leaders at Wednesday's news conference say that's not
good enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must take this opportunity to provide health coverage for
all of our children,'' said Rep. Yvonne Davis (D-Dallas),who is
head of the Black Caucus. ``Anything less than 200 percent coverage
just means we aren't making the kind of commitment we ought to.''
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of lower income limits have argued that it would be
fiscally irresponsible to set a 200 percent limit for children of
all ages because future federal CHIP contributions are uncertain,
and nobody knows how many people will enroll in the program.
Supporters of the 200 percent standard have said that advocates of
lower levels overestimate the number of people who would
participate.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 471,000 Texas children would be eligible for CHIP
under the 200 percent threshold. About 220,000 are in families
making between 150 percent and 200 percent of the poverty level.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush, who will send the state's CHIP plan to
Washington for federal approval, has suggested that he will abide
by the will of the Legislature on the question of income limits.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As Hillary Rodham Clinton and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
test the waters for Senate campaigns next year, a New York
Times/CBS News poll shows that New York state voters hold strongly
partisan opinions, but also nagging reservations, about both
politicians, indicating that a contest between them would be highly
competitive.
</P>
<P>
   The survey shows Mrs. Clinton leading Giuliani in several
categories at this early juncture. A larger number of voters view
her favorably, saying they think she is more caring and would
likely be more effective than the mayor, a Republican. When asked
which candidate they would vote for if the election were held
today, 48 percent said Mrs. Clinton and 39 percent said Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Still 20 months away from the election, most voters' opinions
about the race are fluid, and are likely to have been influenced by
factors that may have no bearing on the final outcome, from the
name recognition of the potential candidates to recent events like
the shooting of Amadou Diallo by the New York City police and the
impeachment trial of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The poll also suggested in several ways that Giuliani might not
be quite as vulnerable as the figures indicate, and that Mrs.
Clinton might not be quite as strong.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the survey showed that a significant number of
voters, 4 out of 10, think that the first lady would not be an
effective representative for New York in the Senate because she has
never lived in the state. Republicans have already said that they
would make Mrs. Clinton's residency a campaign issue, and the poll
indicates that a vigorous effort to portray the first lady as a
carpetbagger could work with some voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't seem right that just because she's the president's
wife that she can suddenly decide that she can run for Senate from
this state,'' Sherry Groff, 24, a Democrat from the town of
Copenhagen, north of Syracuse, said in a follow-up interview.
``It's as if she's got her pick of all 50 and decided New York will
be the one.''
</P>
<P>
   The poll also showed that 6 out of 10 voters north of the New
York City suburbs were unable to give an opinion of Giuliani, more
than double the number for Mrs. Clinton. The upstate region has
historically been a Republican stronghold, and Giuliani would be
widely expected to win a higher percentage of that bloc of voters.
</P>
<P>
   But the poll also underscored a potential vulnerability for
Giuliani: voters were evenly split over whether he had the right
disposition to be a senator. Democrats have said they believe
voters will reject Giuliani out of concerns that his iron-fisted
style, while perhaps appropriate for a big city executive, will
alienate colleagues in the collegial halls of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's too autocratic,'' said Ellen Smith, 38, a social worker
from Westchester County who is not registered in either major
party. ``When you're mayor of New York City and you want to make
sure people cross the street at the right time, that's one thing.
But when you're a senator dealing with a whole state and lots of
issues, you have to be more flexible.''
</P>
<P>
   The poll comes at a low point in the mayor's job-approval
rating, which has been hurt in the city by concerns about police
brutality and race relations. Conversely, Mrs. Clinton is basking
in high ratings that stem in part from voter sympathy for her stoic
handling of the Monica Lewinsky affair and the president's
impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton has also probably benefited from her husband's 75
percent job-approval rating in the state, which is down just
slightly from his all-time high of 78 percent last October. And
because she has never run for office before, Mrs. Clinton has yet
to endure the level of campaign stress and scrutiny from the news
media that can cause a candidate's approval ratings to drop.
</P>
<P>
   The Times/CBS News poll was conducted by telephone March 8
through Sunday and surveyed 1,469 registered voters across the
state. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus three
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Though Mrs. Clinton's aides say she is far from a decision on
whether to run, she has been studying the race with extraordinary
care, having met with or telephoned scores of state Democratic
leaders and county chairmen.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Nita Lowey, D-Westchester County, has said she would
probably enter the race if Mrs. Clinton decided not to run. Rep.
Rick Lazio, R-Suffolk County, has said he may run whether or not
Giuliani becomes a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Other recent public opinion polls have produced a wide range of
results for a Clinton-Giuliani contest, indicating that voters have
not thought much yet about the race or its potential candidates. On
one end of the scale, a poll by Zogby International released this
week showed Giuliani leading by 11 points; at the other end, a
Quinnipiac College poll conducted last month had Mrs. Clinton ahead
by 18 points.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Times/CBS News poll, 52 percent of all state
voters had a favorable opinion of Mrs. Clinton, while 22 percent
had an unfavorable opinion and 26 percent were undecided or did not
know enough about her to offer a viewpoint.
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers were more evenly divided in their views of Giuliani:
34 percent had a favorable opinion of the mayor _ down from 43
percent last October _ 28 percent had an unfavorable opinion, and
38 percent were undecided or did not know enough about him to
formulate an opinion.
</P>
<P>
   In follow-up interviews, people with favorable opinions of Mrs.
Clinton often praised the way she coped with her husband's ordeals
last year, while those with favorable opinions of Giuliani almost
invariably credited him with reducing crime in the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``What she's endured with her husband, the philanderer, has
endeared her to a lot of people,'' said Thomas Phelan, 50, a
Suffolk County Republican who likes Mrs. Clinton. ``She has
toughness.''
</P>
<P>
   The poll showed Mrs. Clinton drawing the vast majority of her
support from core Democratic groups: black and Hispanic voters,
liberals and New York City voters. Giuliani is strongest in the
suburbs and among white Catholic voters, according to the poll.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between the two was starkest among voters who are
members of minorities: 89 percent of black New Yorkers and 78
percent of Hispanic voters said they would support Mrs. Clinton
over Giuliani. White Catholics favored the mayor by 52 percent to
37 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, where Democratic statewide candidates have
historically needed about 70 percent of the vote to win, voters
favored Mrs. Clinton by 66 percent to 25 percent. In the suburbs,
49 percent of all voters said they would vote for Giuliani, against
38 percent for Mrs. Clinton. The two almost evenly split the
upstate region.
</P>
<P>
   The poll showed that Mrs. Clinton has stronger support among
women, with 50 percent saying they would vote for the first lady,
compared with 36 percent for the mayor. Men were almost evenly
split between the two: 46 percent favored Mrs. Clinton to 43
percent for the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   The poll suggested that a Giuliani-Clinton race would be a
fiercely partisan affair. Roughly 7 in 10 Democrats said they would
support Mrs. Clinton, and 2 in 10 would favor Giuliani. Republicans
divided in almost identical ratios in supporting Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   In a clear indication of how close the race might be,
independent voters _ often a barometer of which candidate is ahead
_ were evenly split between the two politicians, with 41 percent
saying they would vote for each.
</P>
<P>
   Slightly more people said they thought Mrs. Clinton would be an
effective senator, with 61 percent saying she would be good at
getting things done for the state, and 54 percent saying the same
of Giuliani. Half of all voters said Mrs. Clinton had the right
experience to be a senator, while 56 percent said they thought
Giuliani did.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Mrs. Clinton cares about the needs and problems of
``people like yourself,'' 63 percent answered yes; 42 percent
answered yes for the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   POLL METHODS BOX
</P>
<P>
   Although the election is 20 months away, and neither candidate
has formally declared an intention to run for U.S. Senate, several
polling organizations have asked voters in New York state about
their preference if Hillary Rodham Clinton and Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani were paired in the contest. Their results have varied.
</P>
<P>
   The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll showed Mrs. Clinton
leading by 9 percentage points over Giuliani. But in the poll
conducted by Zogby International with 708 likely voters during the
same period, Giuliani was ahead by 11 points. Earlier this month,
the Marist College Poll of 702 registered voters showed Mrs.
Clinton ahead by 5 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Two polls conducted last month also showed Mrs. Clinton leading
Giuliani. In the Quinnipiac College Poll of 1,270 registered
voters, Mrs. Clinton was ahead by 18 points. A poll of 819 adults
conducted for Time and CNN by Yankelovich Partners showed Mrs.
Clinton leading by 9 points.
</P>
<P>
   There can be a variety of reasons for differences in polls,
including how the questions are worded, the order in which the
questions are asked, the timing of the poll, how the sample of
respondents is drawn and how the responses are adjusted.
</P>
<P>
   The Times/CBS News poll was based on registered voters who voted
in the 1996 Presidential election or in the election for U.S.
Senate last year, adjusted to reflect the 1996 voter turnout in New
York City, the suburban counties around the city and the rest of
the state.
</P>
<P>
   Other organizations base their results on different types of
respondents. Zogby International's likely voters, for example, are
registered voters who voted last year, have some party
identification and said they were likely to vote in November 2000.
The percentages are also adjusted to reflect usual turnout in New
York City, and turnout by race and by religion based on previous
voting patterns.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the results from the Time/CNN poll are based
on all adults, whether or not they said they were registered to
vote.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Marist Poll and the Quinnipiac Poll are based on
registered voters with adjustments to take into account the
traditionally lower voter turnout in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   The margin of sampling error of these polls was three or four
percentage points in either direction.

EXTERNAL REVIEW OF PATIENT CARE STILL UNDECIDED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Ore., R.I., Vt.)  (rk) 
 By   MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Who should control patient care _ doctors at the patient's
bedside or doctors working for the patient's insurance company? The
Senate Labor Committee appears poised to answer ``neither'' when it
votes this week on patient protections.
</P>
<P>
   The committee plans to turn the ultimate decision in cases where
bedside physicians and insurance companies disagree over to expert
panels, some at faraway academic medical centers.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly how to implement external review remains controversial.
But if the idea is handled creatively, it could sweep away the
brawl over legal liability that doomed last year's efforts to pass
a patients' ``bill of rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats and Republicans acknowledge the need to respond to
patient complaints that health plans persistently deny them
reimbursement for necessary medical care. The number of such
complaints is small, but the ones with merit can reflect shockingly
callous behavior by health plans.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats have led the way in proposing changes. Until now,
they have focused on giving patients covered at work the right,
largely prohibited under current law, to sue health plans for
economic and punitive damages. But that almost certainly won't fly,
given that a Republican controlled Congress is highly unlikely to
approve what would amount to a trial lawyers relief act.
</P>
<P>
   So what's the alternative? Some advocates admit privately that
the right to sue may not be necessary, at least for the near
future, if Congress passes two other provisions as part of an
overall bill.
</P>
<P>
   The first would guarantee that patients could appeal denials to
an outside panel of experts. The second, recently proposed by two
Senators, Jack Reed, D-R.I. and Ron Wyden, D-Ore., would have
states set up networks of counselors to guide patients through
appeals to their plan and to external panels.
</P>
<P>
   Though the principle of mandatory external review garners
bipartisan support, actual proposals do not. The Democrats propose
defining medically necessary care in law, using what might be
called a prudent doctor test: is the doctor following ``generally
accepted principles of professional medical practice.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats would prohibit plans from ``arbitrarily
interfering with the decision of the treating physician.'' What
could be wrong with those standards?
</P>
<P>
   ``Plenty,'' replies Karen Ignagni, president of the American
Association of Health Plans, which represents about 1,000 private
managed-care plans. She says the Democratic language, though
claiming to leave the decision up to expert panels, ``in fact stops
them, as well as the health plan, from reviewing whether decisions
by physicians are medically appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert H. Brook of RAND Health recently testified, after
reviewing dozens of studies, that ``20 to 30 percent of the care
given to patients is unnecessary,'' yet ``patients do not receive
perhaps as many as one-third of services they should receive.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ignagni fears that the Democrats' bill would insulate
customary, often wasteful, practices from challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Nell Lehnhard of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield
Association, agrees. ``If the plans are forced to prove that each
inappropriate treatment is in fact inappropriate, we will turn back
the clock to the days of unnecessary overtreatment and unchecked
medical inflation,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   So how should expert panels make decisions in a world where
physician practices vary widely? Should the burden of providing
proof be placed on the plan or the physician? Because scientific
evidence is often indecisive, the side that bears the burden of
proof may often lose the appeal.
</P>
<P>
   David Richardson, president of an organization that performs
external review for Medicare enrollees and private plans, would
ordinarily allow plans to choose treatments from among those
customarily practiced unless the panel found that the treatment was
inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
   The bill proposed by James M. Jeffords of Vermont, the
Republican chairman of the Senate Labor Committee, answers the
question by not answering the question. He would not define medical
necessity or place the burden of proof on either side, essentially
leaving it up to the expert panels to decide by a preponderance of
the scientific and medical evidence, however murky.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The new wrinkle in the debate is the emergence of managed-care
leaders who embrace external review. Michael Stocker, the president
of Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield of New York state says that
external panels of experts can be trusted to make the right
decisions if they are held up to professional scrutiny because
``there usually is general agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Arthur Leibowitz, medical director of Aetna U.S.
Healthcare, &UR;  &LR; which already offers enrollees the right to external
appeal, agrees, though he opposes federal mandates.
</P>
<P>
   Mandating external appeal is only part of the solution, says
Wyden. The Reed-Wyden bill, supported by patient advocates like Ron
Pollack, executive director of Families USA Foundation, would turn
money over to the states to set up networks of counselors to help
steer patients through appeals.
</P>
<P>
   The idea, says Wyden, ``is to intervene early, resolving
modest-sized grievances in a nonadversarial way before they
mushroom into huge grievances that need costly litigation.''
Supporters of the proposal expect it to soften the controversy over
litigation by largely eliminating the need to take health plans to
court if and when Congress makes that possible. &QL;

U.S. DIPLOMAT IN KOSOVO TALKS COMES UNDER FIRE IN CONGRESS

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A senior State Department officer, now the head of
the American delegation to the Kosovo peace talks, may have lied
when he testified before Congress three years ago about death
squads in Haiti, according to an investigation by the State
Department's inspector general.
</P>
<P>
   Depite the conclusions of the inspector general's office, in a
report in February of 1998, the diplomat, James Dobbins, remained
in high-level government positions and has been promoted.
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general, Jacquelyn Williams-Bridgers, concluded
that Dobbins ``acted with reckless disregard'' for the consequences
when he testified before the House International Relations
Committee on two occasions. The testimony was ``incomplete,
misleading and possibly perjurious,'' the report said, adding that
Dobbins presented testimony his colleagues warned him was slanted,
and failed to exercise the integrity expected of a senior Executive
Branch officer.
</P>
<P>
   Dobbins testified about an investigation into the death of a
politically prominent Haitian. He said that the only word he had
received about the inquiry by the FBI was that it was continuing.
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general had evidence, in fact, that the bureau had
briefed Dobbins on its work, which had ended in frustration and a
lack of cooperation from the government of President Jean-Bertrand
Aristide, which the United States supported.
</P>
<P>
   The internal investigation, which was never made public, has
come back to haunt Dobbins, a 56-year old career diplomat who has
won numerous awards and honors. Last month, he was named the
secretary of state's special envoy to the Balkans, replacing Robert
Gelbard. At the time of his testimony, he was the senior State
Department coordinator of Haitian policy.
</P>
<P>
   The existence of the inspector general's 700-page report on
Dobbins was disclosed provided by two Clinton administration
officials who are opposed to the appointment.
</P>
<P>
   Dobbins, who challenged the inspector general's report, declined
on Wednesday to discuss it publicly. He referred questions to the
State Department.
</P>
<P>
   James Foley, deputy State Department spokesman, said Wednesday,
``The allegations were thoroughly investigated, and it was
determined that Ambassador Dobbins testified in good faith and did
not intentionally mislead Congress.'' He said Dobbins ``retains the
full confidence'' of Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
   Foley declined to say what if any disciplinary action had been
taken against Dobbins.
</P>
<P>
   In his testimony Dobbins was defending Washington's Haiti
policy, which was under attack at the time by Republicans who are
also using Dobbins to strike out at the Clinton administration's
policy on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   One recent blow to the Kosovo policy came from chairman of the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Jesse Helms, has wrote to
Albright expressing concerns about the appointment of Dobbins.
</P>
<P>
   Helms urged Albright to ``renew your search for the very best
candidate for the position of special adviser on Kosovo _
preferably one who has not been accused by the State Department's
inspector general of lying to Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If it is the decision of the department not to discipline
Dobbins for lying to Congress, at the very least his alleged
conduct does not merit a promotion,'' Helms concluded his letter of
Feb. 25.
</P>
<P>
   Helms' office said he had received no response to the letter.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   After completing her investigation, the inspector general
referred the matter to the Justice Department's Office of Public
Integrity for possible prosecution. The Department declined to
prosecute and sent the matter back to the State Department for
``appropriate disciplinary action.''
</P>
<P>
   Dobbins' problems arose out of an investigation into the murder,
in 1995, of Mireille Durocher Bertin, a prominent right-wing critic
of President Aristide.
</P>
<P>
   Following 30 years of brutal dictatorship in Haiti, Aristide, a
populist Roman Catholic priest with leftist politics, had been
elected president in 1990, only to be overthrown by a military coup
several months later.
</P>
<P>
   Violence accelerated and in September 1994, President Clinton,
over strong Republican opposition in Congress, sent in troops to
Haiti to establish order and restore Aristide to the presidency.
Shootings and violence continued, with charges that they were now
the work of Aristide's government.
</P>
<P>
   When Mrs. Durocher Bertin was killed, President Clinton
dispatched an FBI team to help investigate.
</P>
<P>
   After eight months, the FBI left, frustrated with a lack of
cooperation from the Aristide government.
</P>
<P>
   But that is not what Dobbins, who was the Clinton
administration's coordinator of Haiti policy, told Congress,
according to a transcript of the hearings.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are still conducting their investigation, and as far as I
know have not come to a conclusion,'' Dobbins testified.
</P>
<P>
   In a State Department memorandum, declassified for the hearings,
the author, not identified, wrote that ``the more compelling theory
developed by the FBI'' pointed to the involvement of Haitian
officials and police officers. This was contrary to speculation
that the killing was drug-related or the work of right-wing
extremists. The killing remains unsolved.
</P>
<P>
   Dobbins also said that the FBI had not briefed him or anyone
else in the administration about its work, and so he could not
provide any information to the committee.
</P>
<P>
   But the FBI provided the committee with communications from the
agency to the Department of State during the investigation. ``The
contacts listed above clearly illustrate that the DOS was kept
apprised of the investigation based on the regular meetings between
DOS personnel and FBI agents in Haiti, and the requests by the FBI
for DOS assistance,'' the FBI said in a 16-page secret report.
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general's office began its investigation in
mid-1996 after a request from the Republican chairman of the House
International Relations Committee, Benjamin Gilman, and the
chairman of the subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere, Dan Burton.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators interviewed officials at the State Department,
National Security Council, Department of Justice, Central
Intelligence Agency and FBI, and also looked at cable traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ambassador Dobbins acted with reckless disregard for the
clearly foreseeable adverse consequences of his actions,'' the
report's summary said, ``both in his lack of candor with''
Congress, ``and in his failure to heed the warnings of colleagues
that his intended presentation to the Congress was slanted and
one-sided.''
</P>
<P>
   Such conduct, the inspector general found, ``was in
contravention of his responsibilities as a senior Executive Branch
officer to act with integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   After the commencement of the inspector general's investigation,
Dobbins was made a special assistant to president and senior
director of Latin American at the National Security Council, a
position that did not require Senate confirmation.
</P>
<P>
   Dobbins' promotion to the post as special envoy to the Balkans
also does not require confirmation.

TENSION GROWS AS SCHOOL TAX DEALINE NEARS IN NEW HAMPSHIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RALPH JIMENEZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. _ As New Hampshire's legislature searched for a
way out of an education funding crisis that has consumed the state,
one group that included conservative legislators took to handing
out bright yellow cards with a Latin inscription: Ite Ut Harebnam
Pulsetis.
</P>
<P>
   Their translation: Go pound sand.
</P>
<P>
   The message, intended for the high court which imposed an April
1 deadline on lawmakers, captured well an increasing sense of
desperation here. With two weeks to go, the badly fractured New
Hampshire Senate held hearings Wednesday on a range of conflicting
proposals to solve the education funding crisis. But, with no vote
scheduled in the Senate until next week, and no clear consensus
emerging, key players from Gov. Jeanne Shaheen on down are saying
there is little hope of meeting the court's deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if there was any chance that the legislature would come to
agreement by April 1, House Minority Leader Peter Burling said
flatly, ``None.''
</P>
<P>
   Missing the deadline by a few days would not spell disaster. But
if the deadlock drags on, officials will be forced to issue pink
slips to everyone who works in the schools, notifying them that
their jobs end with this school year. School cannot begin until a
tax is agreed on that passes constitutional muster.
</P>
<P>
   Political action is now focused in the Senate. The House this
month narrowly passed a measure that included what would be the
state's first income tax. Shaheen, who vowed before elected to
reject any broad-based tax increase, warned legislators not to send
her any proposal that includes an income tax.
</P>
<P>
   ``Veto, veto, veto,'' said Judy Reardon, the governor's lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate, which Democrats control for the first time in 86
years, would pass an income tax as well, were it not for the veto
threat. Observers agree that the legislature would not have the
votes to overcome a veto.
</P>
<P>
   For now, it seems, virtually everything is on the table: the $1
increase in the liquor tax; a 4 percent sales tax proposal from one
senator; plans to permit video slot machines at the state's four
racetracks and four White Mountain hotels; an income tax, a sales
tax, a tax on rental cars and a slew of plans to increase the
state's business taxes. One plan suggested taxing movie tickets.
</P>
<P>
   All the serious plans include some form of statewide property
tax.
</P>
<P>
   One plan that seemed to be gaining ground this week is a
European-style 1 percent consumption tax on all sales and services
sponsored by Rep. Andy Peterson, son of former Gov. Walter
Peterson.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my 29th year and I haven't seen it quite so chaotic,''
said Clesson ``Junie'' Blaisdell, an income tax proponent and
president of the bealeagured Senate. Part of the blame, she
insisted, lay with the Shaheen's refusal to consider an income tax.
``The governor's position has changed over the past few months and
now her pledge to veto any broad base tax applies only to an income
tax.''
</P>
<P>
   Blaisdell, a basketball referee for 30 years, keeps Bruins
greast Bobby Orr's number 4 jersey on the wall above his desk along
with photographs signed by Orr and Bruin Derek Sanderson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just about ready to bring out my whistle and put it on and
start calling some offensive fouls,'' he said of the agonizing end
game that will change the state's tax structure.
</P>
<P>
   The confusion is in part a reflection of the public's
ambivalence. Voters themselves have only recently begun paying
close attention to a debate that could change their tax bills and
New Hampshire's image of its parsimonious self. A poll commissioned
by two newspapers found that 57 percent opposed an income tax, but
60 percent supported the idea of a tax system based on ability to
pay.
</P>
<P>
   Respect for New Hampshire's traditional pledge never to enact a
broad-based sales or income tax has all but vanished. The numbing
process has resulted in a ``lessening of resistance'' to a myriad
of tax options that might never have been considered in the past,
said Democratic Sen. Rick Trombley, pointing to the the tiny room
where tax plans were being aired.
</P>
<P>
   Trombley's own plan to answer the challenge first posed by the
city of Claremont and other property-poor communities that sued the
state would include raising taxes on liquor and imposing a business
tax, though not as high as the one suggested by Shaheen.
</P>
<P>
   ``One lobbyist will get something put in that they want, and
another one will take somebody else aside and get it taken and and
something else substituted for it.'' Trombley pointed to a 14-foot
mural on the State House wall depicting Gen. Pickett's charge into
cannon fire on July 3, 1863 and said, ``That's Claremont.''

U.S. DIPLOMAT IN KOSOVO TALKS COMES UNDER FIRE IN CONGRESS

   WASHINGTON _ A senior State Department officer, now the head of
the American delegation to the Kosovo peace talks, may have lied
when he testified before Congress three years ago about death
squads in Haiti, according to an investigation by the State
Department's inspector general.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the conclusions of the inspector general's office, in a
report in February of 1998, the diplomat, James Dobbins, remained
in high-level government positions and has been promoted.
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general, Jacquelyn Williams-Bridgers, concluded
that Dobbins ``acted with reckless disregard'' for the consequences
when he testified before the House International Relations
Committee on two occasions. The testimony was ``incomplete,
misleading and possibly perjurious,'' the report said, adding that
Dobbins presented testimony his colleagues warned him was slanted,
and failed to exercise the integrity expected of a senior Executive
Branch officer.
</P>
<P>
   Dobbins testified about an investigation into the death of a
politically prominent Haitian. He said that the only word he had
received about the inquiry by the FBI was that it was continuing.
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general had evidence, in fact, that the bureau had
briefed Dobbins on its work, which had ended in frustration and a
lack of cooperation from the government of President Jean-Bertrand
Aristide, which the United States supported.
</P>
<P>
   The internal investigation, which was never made public, has
come back to haunt Dobbins, a 56-year old career diplomat who has
won numerous awards and honors. Last month, he was named the
secretary of state's special envoy to the Balkans, replacing Robert
Gelbard. At the time of his testimony, he was the senior State
Department coordinator of Haitian policy.
</P>
<P>
   The existence of the inspector general's 700-page report on
Dobbins was disclosed provided by two Clinton administration
officials who are opposed to the appointment.
</P>
<P>
   Dobbins, who challenged the inspector general's report, declined
on Wednesday to discuss it publicly. He referred questions to the
State Department.
</P>
<P>
   James Foley, deputy State Department spokesman, said Wednesday,
``The allegations were thoroughly investigated, and it was
determined that Ambassador Dobbins testified in good faith and did
not intentionally mislead Congress.'' He said Dobbins ``retains the
full confidence'' of Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
   Foley declined to say what if any disciplinary action had been
taken against Dobbins.
</P>
<P>
   In his testimony Dobbins was defending Washington's Haiti
policy, which was under attack at the time by Republicans who are
also using Dobbins to strike out at the Clinton administration's
policy on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   One recent blow to the Kosovo policy came from chairman of the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Jesse Helms, has wrote to
Albright expressing concerns about the appointment of Dobbins.
</P>
<P>
   Helms urged Albright to ``renew your search for the very best
candidate for the position of special adviser on Kosovo _
preferably one who has not been accused by the State Department's
inspector general of lying to Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If it is the decision of the department not to discipline
Dobbins for lying to Congress, at the very least his alleged
conduct does not merit a promotion,'' Helms concluded his letter of
Feb. 25.
</P>
<P>
   Helms' office said he had received no response to the letter.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   After completing her investigation, the inspector general
referred the matter to the Justice Department's Office of Public
Integrity for possible prosecution. The Department declined to
prosecute and sent the matter back to the State Department for
``appropriate disciplinary action.''
</P>
<P>
   Dobbins' problems arose out of an investigation into the murder,
in 1995, of Mireille Durocher Bertin, a prominent right-wing critic
of President Aristide.
</P>
<P>
   Following 30 years of brutal dictatorship in Haiti, Aristide, a
populist Roman Catholic priest with leftist politics, had been
elected president in 1990, only to be overthrown by a military coup
several months later.
</P>
<P>
   Violence accelerated and in September 1994, President Clinton,
over strong Republican opposition in Congress, sent in troops to
Haiti to establish order and restore Aristide to the presidency.
Shootings and violence continued, with charges that they were now
the work of Aristide's government.
</P>
<P>
   When Mrs. Durocher Bertin was killed, President Clinton
dispatched an FBI team to help investigate.
</P>
<P>
   After eight months, the FBI left, frustrated with a lack of
cooperation from the Aristide government.
</P>
<P>
   But that is not what Dobbins, who was the Clinton
administration's coordinator of Haiti policy, told Congress,
according to a transcript of the hearings.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are still conducting their investigation, and as far as I
know have not come to a conclusion,'' Dobbins testified.
</P>
<P>
   In a State Department memorandum, declassified for the hearings,
the author, not identified, wrote that ``the more compelling theory
developed by the FBI'' pointed to the involvement of Haitian
officials and police officers. This was contrary to speculation
that the killing was drug-related or the work of right-wing
extremists. The killing remains unsolved.
</P>
<P>
   Dobbins also said that the FBI had not briefed him or anyone
else in the administration about its work, and so he could not
provide any information to the committee.
</P>
<P>
   But the FBI provided the committee with communications from the
agency to the Department of State during the investigation. ``The
contacts listed above clearly illustrate that the DOS was kept
apprised of the investigation based on the regular meetings between
DOS personnel and FBI agents in Haiti, and the requests by the FBI
for DOS assistance,'' the FBI said in a 16-page secret report.
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general's office began its investigation in
mid-1996 after a request from the Republican chairman of the House
International Relations Committee, Benjamin Gilman, and the
chairman of the subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere, Dan Burton.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators interviewed officials at the State Department,
National Security Council, Department of Justice, Central
Intelligence Agency and FBI, and also looked at cable traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ambassador Dobbins acted with reckless disregard for the
clearly foreseeable adverse consequences of his actions,'' the
report's summary said, ``both in his lack of candor with''
Congress, ``and in his failure to heed the warnings of colleagues
that his intended presentation to the Congress was slanted and
one-sided.''
</P>
<P>
   Such conduct, the inspector general found, ``was in
contravention of his responsibilities as a senior Executive Branch
officer to act with integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   After the commencement of the inspector general's investigation,
Dobbins was made a special assistant to president and senior
director of Latin American at the National Security Council, a
position that did not require Senate confirmation.
</P>
<P>
   Dobbins' promotion to the post as special envoy to the Balkans
also does not require confirmation.

`FORCES OF NATURE' A BIT FORCED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use  Friday, March 19  by NYTimes News Service clients)  
Our rating: 2 1/2 stars  
By GLENN WHIPP  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
LOS ANGELES _ Anyone who ever blanched at the prospect of ``'till
death do you part'' will be able to relate to ``Forces of Nature,''
a romantic comedy with a decidedly pragmatic edge to it. The film
certainly seems to reflect these modern times where infidelity pops
up everywhere (even, and especially, the Oval Office) and the
concept of monogamy has become murkier and more old-fashioned than
ever.
<TEXT>
<P>
   At least, that's how it seems to Ben (Ben Affleck), a
buttoned-down copywriter (he composes book-jacket blurbs) soon to
be married to the love of his life, a fresh, funny, earthy Southern
belle named Bridget (Maura Tierney). Problem is, the forces of
nature, not to mention some of Ben's closest friends and family
members, seem to be conspiring to keep him from getting to the
church on time. (``Marriage is a prison,'' Ben's grandfather direly
warns him at one point.)
</P>
<P>
   In a plot turn neatly borrowed (sometimes a little too
obviously) from ``Planes, Trains and Automobiles,'' Ben must
overcome obstacle after obstacle when he attempts to travel from
New York to Savannah, Ga., where Bridget's family is planning an
elaborate outdoor wedding.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest impediment (even more dangerous than a looming
hurricane) turns out to be a free-spirited beauty named Sarah,
whose playful spontaneity completely contradicts Ben's cautious
nature. This pairing soon turns into ``The Odd Couple'' with sexual
chemistry, prompting Ben to think he may not have put enough
thought into his marriage plans, much less his own staid life.
</P>
<P>
   Though rife with comic possibilities, ``Forces of Nature'' too
often plays it safe. You know, for example, when Ben poses as a
doctor on a tour bus full of seniors that some old-timer is going
to keel over with a heart attack and Ben will be pressed into
service. In fact, heart attacks seem to be the plot device of
choice here; there are two in the movie.
</P>
<P>
   But just when the film starts to become a little insufferable,
the filmmakers will inject a neat twist that keeps things
interesting. (Audience favorite: A strip bar scene where nothing _
the bar or the participants _ is as it seems.)
</P>
<P>
   The female roles have a depth uncommon to this type of screwball
comedy. Bullock pulls off the most vibrant performance of her
career, playing a woman whose willingness to embrace change masks
deep insecurities about how she has led her life. Tierney, in what
is typically a thankless role, creates an intelligent, appealing
woman who is every bit as charming as Bullock's Sarah. Both
characters have epiphanies during a finale that is satisfying in
the way it dares to be true.
</P>
<P>
   While the simmering sexual attraction between Affleck and
Bullock is enjoyable and often quite believable, it is somewhat
negated by the solemn dorkiness of Affleck's character. Affleck
seems to be alternately channeling David Schwimmer and Adam Sandler
during the movie, a performance that is every bit as irritating as
it sounds. Faring better are David Strickland as Bridget's old
Savannah boyfriend and the always wonderful Steve Zahn, playing
Ben's party-loving best friend.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, ``Forces of Nature'' leaves you feeling the same
ambivalence that the film's characters express toward marriage.
Just a long as you go into it with your eyes open and understand
what you're getting into (a flawed, but somewhat enjoyable road
comedy with sexy, romantic undercurrents), that need not be an
entirely bad thing.

IOC EXPELS 6 MEMBERS OVER SALT LAKE CITY SCANDAL
</HEADLINE>
  (See also OLY-VECSEY-COLUMN) 
 (sw) 
 By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAUSANNE, Switzerland _ Under tremendous pressure to reform, the
International Olympic Committee formally expelled six members on
Wednesday for corruption related to the Salt Lake City bribery
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Antonio Samaranch, the president of the IOC, also received
a resounding vote of confidence on Wednesday from the 90 attending
members to carry out change, but speculation continued among
Olympic officials that he would not remain in office until his term
is completed in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The expulsions, which had been proposed in January, were the
first relating to corruption in the history of the IOC. Their
ratification was portrayed by IOC officials as a sign that they are
serious about cleaning up the environment of improper cash
payments, medical treatment, lavish gifts and extravagant favors
that has debased the process by which cities bid on the Winter and
Summer Games.
</P>
<P>
   Had the six members not been expelled, IOC officials believed
they would not have had the credibility to begin enacting such
reforms as democratic elections, term limits, open financial
records and open meetings.
</P>
<P>
   However, the IOC is still facing an investigation by the U.S.
Justice Department, threats to curb its power by the U.S. Congress,
and demands for accountability from corporate sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Expelling members does nothing to address the utter lack of
transparency and accountability in IOC processes,'' said Sen. John
McCain, R-Ariz., who is considering stripping the IOC of its
tax-exempt status in the United States and limiting its access to
American television money. ``What we must see are concrete reforms.
These reforms must eliminate completely and forever a culture,
based on gifts and lavish travel, that has brought a dark cloud
over the integrity of the entire Olympic movement.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior IOC officials stressed that Wednesday's expulsions were
only the first steps on a long road to reform. On Thursday, the IOC
is expected to form an ethics commission and a reform commission
and to make an experimental change in the way cities are chosen to
play host to the Games. It expects to have all reforms in place by
the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have a fair amount of work ahead to recover,
regroup and move along,'' said Richard W. Pound of Canada, who
headed the IOC's investigation of the Salt Lake City scandal. ``I
think this is a good start. Had we not done it, it would have been
difficult to move forward.''
</P>
<P>
   By secret ballot, the members who were formally expelled were
Agustin Arroyo of Ecuador, Zein El Abdin Ahmed Gadir of Sudan,
Jean-Claude Ganga of Congo Republic, Lamine Keita of Mali, Sergio
Santander Fantini of Chile and Paul Wallwork of Samoa.
</P>
<P>
   The six accused members were given 20 minutes each to defend
themselves, but, except in the case of Wallwork, all were ousted by
substantially more than the required two-thirds vote among the 90
members. IOC members described the meeting, which was closed to the
news media, as somber, tense and occasionally emotional.
</P>
<P>
   Ganga, who was accused of taking more than $250,000 in improper
inducements from Salt Lake City, was removed by a vote of 88 to 2.
He said the ouster was an unjustified effort to exclude African
members but accepted the decision with sporting good will.
</P>
<P>
   Arroyo, who was accused of violating travel guidelines and whose
family members received $19,000 in financial support from the Salt
Lake City bid committee, said the investigation was too hasty, and
that ``the press wanted heads knocked out and mine happened to be
in the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Santander, who was accused of receiving cash payments of $20,050
from the bid committee, said that the expulsions ousted only
members from relatively powerless countries. Of the 10 members who
have resigned or been expelled in the Salt Lake City scandal, all
but one are from developing nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a political decision,'' Santander said. ``The little
countries are being made to pay.''
</P>
<P>
   Pound denied that more powerful members who were implicated in
the scandal had been given preferential treatment.
</P>
<P>
   One case remaining open is that of Kim Un-yong, a member of the
executive board from South Korea, who has been given a severe
warning for allegedly arranging jobs for his daughter and son
through the Salt Lake City bid committee. He has denied the
accusations.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently upset that he has not yet been cleared, Kim had a
confrontation on Tuesday with Pound and with Francois Carrard, the
executive director of the IOC, during a break of a meeting of the
executive board.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses to the incident, first reported by The Associated
Press, said that angry words were exchanged and that Kim struck a
martial arts stance, which led Carrard to leave the room. Kim is
president of the world tae kwon do federation.
</P>
<P>
   Kim then approached Pound, who, along with Samaranch, forcefully
urged him to calm down, a witness said. An associate of Kim's said
on Wednesday that Kim had been most angry with Pound and had been
concerned that Pound was making a threatening move toward him.
</P>
<P>
   An IOC official said that Kim had sent letters of apology to
Carrard and Pound. Both men joked about the incident on Wednesday,
even though sponsors are certain not to look kindly on the fact
that three of the IOC's senior leaders nearly came to blows at a
time when the Olympic movement is seeking to end divisiveness and
to restore its gravely damaged reputation.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech before Wednesday's expulsions were carried out,
Samaranch said he accepted responsibility for the development of a
crisis that is greater in magnitude than any the IOC has faced.
</P>
<P>
   He proposed the formation on Thursday of a reform commission,
called IOC 2000, that would be composed of 20 to 24 members, half
from the IOC.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first step we must take is to clean our house,'' Samaranch
said.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch asked for a vote of confidence from the 90 members,
and in a secret ballot, he received 86 votes in his favor and 2
against, with 2 abstentions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a clear statement to the outside world that the
president has the total confidence and trust of the membership to
get this issue fixed,'' said Michael Payne, the IOC's marketing
director.
</P>
<P>
   However, IOC officials continued to speculate that Samaranch
would step down once reforms were put in place and he could claim a
legacy of cleaning up a mess that began on his watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants to be able to say he created the framework to move
forward into the next millennium,'' one official said on the
condition of anonymity.  &QL;

THE PARABLE OF `PLEASANTVILLE`
</HEADLINE>
 (For use  Friday, March 19  by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROB LOWMAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Like a weird dream, ``Pleasantville'' is black and
white and in color.
</P>
<P>
   It's the story of a couple of teens, David (Tobey Maguire) and
his libidinous sister Jennifer (Reese Witherspoon), who are
transported ``Twilight Zone''-fashion into David's favorite 1950s
sitcom with the help of a strange TV repairman (Don Knotts).
</P>
<P>
   The simplicity of the show that David has escaped into for
countless hours suddenly becomes a trap. The two have become Bud
and Mary Sue. Their parents are a ``Father Knows Best'' types
George (William H. Macy) and Betty (Joan Allen). They live in the
small town of Pleasantville, where no one has been beyond its
borders and _ more bizarre _ everything is in black and white.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're supposed to be at home, David,'' Jennifer, now dressed
in a poodle skirt and sweater, whines to her brother. ``We're
supposed to be in color.''
</P>
<P>
   The film, which hits video stores Tuesday, is an engaging
parable. This Pleasantville, an idealized town of '50s sitcoms or
Jimmy Stewart movies, is a place of no double beds, toilets or
people of color. The townspeople never feel real joy or anger or
lust. At first, David acts like he's in ``Star Trek'' and insists
that he and his sister follow the prime directive of no
interference. Because he knows all the episodes, it's easy for
David to fit in. But Jennifer has her own hormones to follow, and
soon she introduces a bit of naughtiness into the town. The result
is that the people of Pleasantville literally start blushing
colors, and in certain cases it's like a scarlet letter. (There's
an amusing moment when Jennifer tells her sitcom mom the facts of
life.)
</P>
<P>
   But as certain townsfolk begin to revel in their new-found
freedoms and emotions, others become fearful. A conflict develops
between those of color and those (white males) who want to keep
things in black and white. It's easy to substitute color for
``coloreds,'' especially during the climactic courtroom scene. But
the analogy goes beyond race to include all who unshackle their
mind and rebel _ from rock 'n' rollers to women's libbers to street
artists.
</P>
<P>
   Written and directed by Gary Ross (who wrote ``Big,'' the 1988
movie in which Tom Hanks was a kid trapped in a grown-up's body),
``Pleasantville'' is a bit too pat for its own good at times and
it's hardly profound, but it has a sincere quality that gives us
reason to rethink our own world, especially in light of the
nostalgia crazes that constantly sweep through the culture.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, Ross keeps ``Pleasantville amusing as its inhabitants
discover a new world _ whether when David misses a shot in
basketball practice, which shocks the entire team (``Stand back,
boys!'' warns the coach as the ball rolls away. ``Don't touch
it!''), or when Betty finds out about pleasuring herself while
taking a bath and a tree goes up in flames in full color outside
her window. It also boasts winning performances, particularly from
malt shop owner Mr. Johnson (Jeff Daniels) and Allen, who many
thought would get an Oscar nomination. It also marks the last
performance for the late J.T. Walsh, who was one of those terrific
actors who left an impression even if you didn't know his name.
</P>
<P>
   And music adds tremendously to the film, whether it's Randy
Newman's rich score, which makes you almost yearn for that
imaginary small town, or the sultry jazz beat of Dave Brubeck's
``Take Five'' to the rock of Buddy Holly. It's worth seeing the
film just for that.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
MIGHTY JOE YOUNG: Charlize Theron never gets to say, ``Take your
hands off me, you big ape'' to either of her ``Mighty Joe Young''
co-stars _ Bill Paxton or the giant gorilla of the title. But she
does get to run around a couple of jungles _ one in Africa, the
other the asphalt one of L.A. _ and cuddle up to both of them in
this rousing adventure tale.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mighty Joe'' is the kind of family fare that Disney excels at
_ not too violent for kids but with enough action for adults. The
animatronics and computer-generated images are convincing and even
spectacular at times, and the story of a young woman raised in
Africa trying to save her extra-large but sweet and well-meaning
gorilla is told amusingly and with feeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mighty Joe'' is a film you can enjoy even if you don't have
children.

CHRONIC HEARTBURN CAN INCREASE RISK OF ESOPHAGUS CANCER, STUDY
SHOWS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa.)  (rk)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Chronic heartburn can greatly increase a person's risk of
developing one of the deadliest of cancers, adenocarcinoma of the
esophagus, a major new study has shown.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, in the study, having chronic heartburn increased the
risk of cancer by nearly eightfold. Among patients with
longstanding, severe heartburn, the risk of developing esophageal
cancer was 43.5 times as great as for people who did not have this
problem.

   Heartburn results when the acidic contents of the stomach back
up into the esophagus. Known medically as gastroesophageal reflux
disease, or GERD, heartburn has been the subject of much commercial
attention in recent years following the development of new
prescription and over-the-counter drugs to alleviate the problem.
</P>
<P>
   The findings of the study, conducted among more than 1,400
people in Sweden, were published in Thursday's issue of The New
England Journal of Medicine. The study is the most comprehensive
examination to date of the relationship between reflux disease and
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The strength of the findings prompted the authors to conclude
that chronic reflux is a likely cause of esophageal adenocarcinoma,
which develops in the tubular organ that transports food and drink
from the mouth to the stomach.
</P>
<P>
   The study did not directly assess the benefits of modern
medications for treating reflux disease, and it is not yet known
whether chronic use of these drugs would reduce the risk of
developing cancer.
</P>
<P>
   But American experts said that through periodic examinations of
the esophagus in people with chronic heartburn, it is possible to
detect precancerous changes in the esophageal lining and provide
treatments that prevent the development of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Studies have indicated that 4 percent to 9 percent of adults
have heartburn daily and 10 percent to 15 percent experience it at
least once a week. The condition has been called the Rodney
Dangerfield of modern ailments because most patients afflicted with
it never bring it to their doctors' attention and treat themselves
with over-the-counter antacids, which may not be enough to prevent
dangerous changes in the cells that line the esophagus.
</P>
<P>
   Reflux disease typically causes feelings of tightness or burning
in the upper abdomen or chest area caused by the contact of stomach
acid with the sensitive mucosal cells that line the esophagus.
Symptoms are usually worse when lying down or when the abdominal
area is under pressure, as might occur when a person bends over.
Sometimes there is a regurgitation of a small amount of stomach
contents.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1970, the incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma has been
rising faster than that of any other cancer in the United States.
But, as cancers go, it is relatively rare. Data gathered by the
American Cancer Society shows that esophageal cancer will be
diagnosed in 12,500 people in this country this year and 12,200
will die from it. Although usually considered a disease of older
men, in recent years the age has been dropping, with some cases
occurring in the 40s and 50s.
</P>
<P>
   Most cases are not detected before the disease has spread to
surrounding lymph nodes. As a result, only 12 percent of patients
who develop esophageal cancer survive for five or more years. Even
when the cancer is detected and treated while it is still
localized, the five-year survival rate is only about 25 percent.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Reflux disease results not from an excess of stomach acid but
from improper functioning of the muscular sphincter that separates
the esophagus from the stomach. When functioning normally, Dr.
Henry P. Parkman explained, this sphincter opens only when a person
swallows and otherwise remains tightly contracted to prevent the
acidic contents of the stomach from rising back up into the
esophagus.
</P>
<P>
   Parkman and his colleague, Dr. Sidney Cohen, both
gastroenterologists at Temple University School of Medicine in
Philadelphia, said in an editorial accompanying the new report that
``heartburn must be given respect.'' They urged early evaluation
and aggressive treatment of severe heartburn to allow the damaged
esophageal lining to heal and remain healthy.
</P>
<P>
   The Swedish study compared the occurrence of chronic heartburn
in 189 patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma and 262 patients
with carcinoma of the gastric cardia, the uppermost part of the
stomach, with the incidence of heartburn among 820 people without
cancer and 167 patients with a second form of esophageal cancer
called squamous cell carcinoma, which is linked to heavy alcohol
use and cigarette smoking.
</P>
<P>
   The research team, headed by Dr. Jesper Lagergren of the
Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, found that when patients with
``recurrent symptoms of reflux'' were compared to people without
these symptoms, the likelihood of a diagnosis of esophageal
adenocarcinoma was increased by 770 percent and the likelihood of
adenocarcinoma of the gastric cardia was doubled. There was no
relationship between reflux and squamous cell carcinoma, which
represents nearly half of esophageal cancers.
</P>
<P>
   But the researchers reported, ``The more frequent, more severe
and longer lasting the symptoms of reflux,'' the greater the
patients' risk of being diagnosed with esophageal adenocarcinoma.
Thus, among those with longstanding and severe symptoms of reflux,
the risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma was raised by 4,350 percent
and the risk of adenocarcinoma of the cardia was raised by 440
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Among study participants, the researchers did not find any
benefit of treatment of reflux disease. But they noted that most
patients were treated only briefly or sporadically and sometimes
were given drugs that have since been found to increase
gastroesophageal reflux, like anticholinergic drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Parkman said that virtually all patients who eventually develop
esophageal adenocarcinoma first develop a condition called
Barrett's esophagus in which the lining cells become abnormal in
response to their chronic acid bath. He suggested that patients
with Barrett's esophagus should be examined every one to three
years with an endoscope, and if precancerous cells are found
corrective treatment can be instituted.
</P>
<P>
   For patients with chronic reflux, Parkman and Cohen said that
drug treatment should be administered continuously and indefinitely
to reduce the risk of Barrett's esophagus. Parkman said that drugs
that are especially effective include Pepcid, Zantac, Tagamet and
Axid, which are histamine-2 receptor antagonists that block
histamine, one of the triggers of acid secretion in the stomach.
</P>
<P>
   Even more effective may be Prilosec and Prevacid, which are
proton-pump inhibitors that block the final pathway of acid
secretion and thus are effective against every trigger of acid
release.

BY WIDE MARGIN, SENATE APPROVES MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz., Ill., Vt., Minn., Del., Mass., Iowa, Miss.)  (See also MISSILE-CLINTON) 
(mk) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Embracing a new national policy, the Senate on
Wednesday overwhelmingly approved legislation to field a system to
defend the country against limited long-range missile attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The vote, 97-3, marks a watershed of bipartisan support for a
bill that declares that the United States build _ ``as soon as
technologically possible'' _ a network of radars and interceptors
to shoot down missiles fired by rogue nations like North Korea or
Iran, or accidental launches from Russia or China.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's action does not authorize the construction of an
anti-missile system or appropriate money for it. But it puts more
pressure on the Clinton administration, which has planned to make a
decision in June 2000 about whether it should build such a system.
</P>
<P>
   If such a system is approved, the Pentagon says it would be
ready by 2005, two years later than earlier estimates. The Defense
Department has budgeted $10.5 billion over the next six years for a
system that, in theory, could knock down a handful of ballistic
missiles. It would not protect the country against an all-out
attack, which the original and much grander ``Star Wars'' plan by
President Reagan had envisioned.
</P>
<P>
   The lopsided vote came after the Senate on Tuesday had adopted
two compromise amendments that prompted the White House to abandon
a threatened veto by Clinton. One amendment assures that Democrats
will have a say on any system's cost, by requiring its funding to
go through the regular congressional appropriations process. The
other amendment states that any system be consistent with policies
to reduce Russia's nuclear stockpile.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow has long opposed an American anti-missile system, fearing
it would tilt the strategic balance of power, and arms-control
advocates here have voiced concern that such a system could disrupt
arms control negotiations with Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The vexing issue is likely to come up when the Russian prime
minister, Yevgeny Primakov, visits Washington next week. The
Senate's action could also influence a tentative step the Russian
Parliament took on Tuesday to approve the long-delayed, second
strategic arms reduction treaty, or START 2.
</P>
<P>
   The White House on Wednesday sought to put the best face on what
administration aides said privately was still a troubling bill.
Senate Democrats told Clinton's aides this week that they could not
guarantee at least 34 senators would vote to sustain a presidential
veto. So the White House sought a graceful way out rather than risk
an embarrassing political defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Senate took a very constructive step in adopting an
approach which is consistent with the one the administration has
advocated,'' said James Steinberg, the deputy national security
adviser.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans sarcastically cheered what they said was the
administration's eleventh-hour conversion to a bill that most
Senate Democrats and the White House have long opposed. Republicans
dismissed the two amendments as too obvious or too general to be
objectionable.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a battle which should have been recognized by the
administration months ago as one not to be waged,'' said Sen. John
Warner, R-Va., who heads the Armed Services Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said, ``On the surface, this appears
to be one of the president's more propitious policy reversals.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Democrats had until this year effectively bottled up the
same bill before it could reach the Senate floor. The White House
had threatened a veto, fearing the measure's impact on relations
with Russia.
</P>
<P>
   But the White House found itself in a losing battle after North
Korea and Iran both tested missiles last year, and recent
disclosures revealed that China might have stolen nuclear secrets
that enhanced Beijing's small nuclear arsenal.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Only three Democratic senators _ Richard Durbin of Illinois,
Patrick Leahy of Vermont and Paul Wellstone of Minnesota _ voted
against the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Many other Democrats who initially opposed the bill supported it
after the two amendments passed, both by 99-0. But many were
holding their noses as they voted, careful not to hand Republicans
a potent political issue.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph Biden Jr., D-Del., the ranking Democrat on the
Foreign Relations Committee, who on Tuesday called the bill
``nothing more than an exercise in political theater,'' said
Wednesday that the two amendments ``removed the most dangerous
implications of the original bill.''
</P>
<P>
   He added dismissively that the measure ``fails to address in a
serious manner the national security challenges facing the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   Two other Democrats, Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts and Sen.
Tom Harkin of Iowa, said a national missile defense would not stop
many other threats, from cruise missiles to terrorist car-bombings.
</P>
<P>
   Harkin, invoking France's vaunted but ineffective Maginot Line
against the German army in World War II, said: ``Are we going to
spend tens of billions of dollars to defend against a single
threat? The enemy will simply go around. We seem to want one simple
silver bullet.''
</P>
<P>
   But the bill's chief Republican sponsor, Sen. Thad Cochran of
Mississippi, called the Democrats' complaints exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill is intended to establish a broad policy,'' Cochran
said. ``It does not intend to micromanage the Defense Department's
conduct of the program.''

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The 60 men were slumped in their chairs, weary
with the weight of the ex-hooker's insults.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hated you!'' she said, hurling her words so that the men in
the back row with their heads in their hands would take notice.
They did, snapping to attention as though they had been pinched.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to stick a knife in you!'' the woman shouted, jolting
an old man so hard that he knocked his glasses off his face.
</P>
<P>
   It was not even lunch time and the men had already endured a
prosecutor's hourlong lecture on the law against soliciting,
close-up color slides showing the affects of venereal disease, and
three other angry ex-prostitutes. In the afternoon there would be
more lectures _ from police officers, business owners and residents
of prostitution-plagued neighborhoods. And for this daylong
humiliation in a drafty room in the San Francisco Hall of Justice,
the men paid $500 and considered themselves lucky: Their first
arrest for soliciting sex would be wiped from their records, never
to haunt them.
</P>
<P>
   Unless, of course, they get caught a second time.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to San Francisco's answer to the world's oldest
profession. Modeled after those daylong traffic schools for bad
drivers, the First Offender Prostitution Program _ or ``john
school,'' as people here call it _ is tackling the sex trade by
trying to drum some sense into those who perpetuate it. The police
say the program, the first of its kind, is working splendidly. Of
the 2,181 men who have taken the class since it began four years
ago, only 18 have been re-arrested and prosecuted after their names
were checked against the program's list of participants. The
program's success has created such a buzz all over the country that
several cities, including Fresno; Las Vegas; Toronto and Nashville,
Tenn., have fashioned similar programs and others are considering
them.
</P>
<P>
   No one contends that the program will put a stop to
prostitution; Massage parlors, escort services, strip clubs and
other fronts for the sex trade persist here. But together with an
aggressive outreach program that helps prostitutes find an
alternative to street life and relentless police undercover
operations that arrest the men who buy sex, the first-offender
program, the police say, has led to a sharp, visible drop in San
Francisco's outdoor sex trade. Indeed, for a city of nearly 800,000
people, the level of street prostitution here is relatively small,
reduced to one or two spots.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you'd seen this before, it was like a sex bazaar,'' said
Tom Buckley, a police lieutenant in the city's Northern Station, as
he led an operation the other night in a neighborhood called Polk
Gulch with four police decoy prostitutes (three women and a man)
and four teams of three arresting officers. Cars with single men
kept circling around one block where an officer stood shivering in
a halter top and spandex tights. In four hours on a slow night, the
team arrested 43 men, and virtually every one of them opted for the
john school over prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Results like these have given the first-offender program its
considerable attention. Last fall the program won a $100,000
Innovations in American Government award from the Ford Foundation,
the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard and the Council
for Excellence in Government. That has led to an avalanche of
requests to visit from law-enforcement officials throughout the
country. Last month alone, 45 officials from seven cities _
Portland, Ore., Seattle, Pittsburgh, Washington, Jacksonville,
Fla., Springfield, Mo., and St. Paul, Minn. _ came here for a look.
</P>
<P>
   To Norma Hotaling, a former prostitute who co-founded the
program in 1995 with a police lieutenant and an assistant
prosecutor, the most exciting part of this war on street sex is the
SAGE Project Inc., a nonprofit service organization she runs that
helps prostitutes and other women. Since it began as a small
outreach group in 1992, she said, the organization, which receives
some of its money from the first-offender program, has helped 500
young women get off the streets. Fifteen of those now work full
time at the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no other city doing what we're doing,'' Ms. Hotaling
said. ``Everyone just arrests the women and throws them in jail.
But we're getting them off the streets, getting them vocational
training, saving hundreds of thousands of dollars a year on the
medical care the city spends on these women.''
</P>
<P>
   Organizations advocating the legalization of prostitution,
including Coyote and the Sex Workers Alliance of Vancouver, have
criticized Ms. Hotaling and the john school for emphasizing the
victimization of street prostitutes at the hands of pimps and
customers. But a recent study of 130 local prostitutes, Ms.
Hotaling said, found that 68 percent had been raped _ almost half
at least five times _ and that 82 percent had been assaulted.
</P>
<P>
   And the stories told by former prostitutes at the john school,
reminiscent of the prison horror stories that inmates tell youths
in ``scared straight'' programs, have a palpable impact on the men
in the class.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent class the men _ of all ages and races _ were clearly
mortified by the women's stories, squirming in their seats and
often looking down at the floor as they were lectured.
</P>
<P>
   Angel Cassidy, a dark-haired woman in her early 30s who started
working the streets when she was 14 told the men that she lied when
clients would ask if she was a heroin addict. ``I'd have needle
tracks all up and down my arms and say no,'' she said. She would
have unprotected sex, she said, even though she had had several
venereal diseases. She fantasized about maiming the men.
</P>
<P>
   Several men shuddered.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hotaling's story was a surprise. At 47, her street days nine
years behind her, she looks like a suburban mom, dressed in
coordinating jacket and slacks, her blond hair efficiently short.
After showing the grisly slides of what venereal disease does to
sexual organs, she quietly said she knew all about prostitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a prostitute for 20 years, and a heroin addict,'' Ms.
Hotaling said. ``I planned on sticking a knife in a john, any john,
and thank God for you and me that I got out before that happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The men also heard stories about the customers who did not get
away _ men who were robbed and stabbed by prostitutes. At the end
of the day they walked out of class looking spent.
</P>
<P>
   Few would meet a reporter's eye as they left, but one student
agreed to give his assessment of the class, anonymously.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was harmless,'' the man, a 40-year-old computer
technician, said of his soliciting an undercover police officer for
oral sex. ``I know I'm harmless. But I think when they talked about
the diseases they had, that really made me sick. That and the
slides. I don't want to risk getting caught again either.''
</P>
<P>
   Next time he felt a certain urge, he said, his face reddening,
he would rent a movie.

INDEPENDENT COUNSEL LAW IS TOO FLAWED TO RENEW, RENO TELLS SENATE
PANEL 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno said at a Senate
hearing on Wednesday that she was prepared to abandon the
independent counsel statute because it had failed to remove
politics from cases involving top administration officials, was
fatally flawed by procedural ambiguities and seriously distorted
critical prosecution decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``My change of heart about this statute has not come lightly,''
Reno told the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee. ``To those who
question me about this or who tell me that they told me so, I can
only say this: I've now seen how the statute operates close up,
probably more close up than anybody in this country. And I know
more than I did before.''
</P>
<P>
   But several senators from both political parties seemed
unprepared to accept Reno's recommendation that the law be allowed
to expire in June. Lawmakers said the efforts to amend the statute
would be worthwhile if the changes could achieve the law's original
purpose to assure independent investigations of high-level
administration officials.
</P>
<P>
   Sen/ Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., who is chairman of the committee,
expressed skepticism about Reno's views and her conversion from
supporter to critic of the statute. She announced her opposition
publicly only after she had repeatedly refused to accede to
Republican demands to seek an independent counsel to investigate
how the Democrats had financed the 1996 presidential election, a
subject that Thompson's committee investigated in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand that you disagree with me on some of my decisions
and that you agree with me on others,'' Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Which ones do you think I agree with you on?'' Thompson asked,
suggesting that he might not agree with her on anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea,'' she said, ``but I am sure you would be
raising all of them if you disagreed with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Several senators pressed Reno to discuss the specific cases, but
she refused to answer any questions about the conduct of the
Whitewater prosecutor, Kenneth Starr, or any other independent
counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, she seemed to refer to Starr, along with other
independent counsels, when she said that some of them had ``unduly
expansive'' views of their jurisdictions and had gone ``down every
investigative side street'' in pursuit of their subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said the law also distorted prosecutorial decision making
because independent counsels investigating a single official had
unlimited time and money, unlike career prosecutors who must
constantly juggle competing priorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``An independent counsel typically is charged with investigating
one person, and so all his or her energy, ingenuity and resources
are pointed in one direction,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``An independent counsel,'' she added, ``will not be judged on
the basis of a broad track record, but on one case alone. If the
counsel uncovers nothing, or fails to secure an indictment or
conviction, some may conclude that he or she has wasted both time
and money.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno said the procedural mechanisms that triggered the law were
unworkable. As an example, she pointed to the statute's requirement
that the attorney general must refer a case to an independent
prosecutor if she concludes that reasonable grounds exist to
believe that further investigation is warranted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of us think that some further investigation can almost
always be warranted,'' Reno said, ``and there is usually a doubt or
two that you'd like to resolve, especially if there are no
constraints on time and money. But should an investigation proceed
even where there is no reasonable prospect of making a prosecutable
case? The statute does not provide a clear answer to that question.
And any effort to read reason into the standard in particular cases
often generates much criticism and controversy.''

`KING AND I' WHISTLES HAPPY TUNE FOR YOUNGSTERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use  Friday, March 19  by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROB LOWMAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For the last several years, Disney has created
animated features like ``Beauty and the Beast'' and ``The Lion
King'' and successfully turned them into Broadway shows. Now
Warners has done the reverse with the classic Rodgers and
Hammerstein musical ``The King and I,'' transforming it into an
animated feature.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, would that it were that easy, but even a wonderful score and
story do not make a classic film or even a particularly good one.
If the goal here was to introduce the younger set to the charms of
Broadway musicals, then ``The King and I'' does have its pluses.
</P>
<P>
   You probably know in one form or another the true story of Anna
Leonowens, a widowed British schoolteacher who journeys to Siam
with her son to tutor the children of the king in the mid-19th
century. It was first a book, then a stage play, then a musical and
finally a 1956 film starring Deborah Kerr (as Anna) and Yul Brynner
(as the King). That film picked up nine Academy Award nominations,
winning five, including a best actor statuette.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict between the strong-willed Anna and the King, who is
the unchallenged ruler of his land, is at the heart of story. It is
only after the numerous and often-amusing clashes that the King and
Anna reach a level of mutual respect.
</P>
<P>
   This animated version has reworked the story. The villain,
Kralahome (Ian Richardson), now has magical powers, which allows
the filmmakers to create some fantastical scenes. His sidekick,
Master Little (Darrell Hammond), is meant to be there for comic
relief as are three more characters _ an elephant, a monkey and a
panther.
</P>
<P>
   Presumably this was all done to make the film more kid friendly.
Little of this works particularly well, however. When Anna (Miranda
Richardson) and her son are sailing to Siam to meet the King
(Martin Vidnovic), Kralahome sends a sea monster to stop the ship
and Anna helps her son overcome his fear by singing ``I Whistle a
Happy Tune,'' the scene is more ludicrous than uplifting.
</P>
<P>
   But the tone of this movie isn't its only problem. In this new
era of animation where Disney and DreamWorks have continued to
raise the bar, ``The King and I'' looks old-fashioned at best and,
at times, remarkably cheesy. There are some Saturday morning shows
with better animation. Making it more obvious, the filmmakers _
producer Arthur Rankin (``Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,''
``Frosty the Snowman'') and director Richard Rich (``The Fox and
the Hound,'' ``The Black Cauldron'') _ inserted a couple of
computer-generated images that stick out, but not in a good way.
</P>
<P>
   But the filmmakers haven't completely sapped the charm out of
the musical. With songs like ``Getting to Know You,'' ``Shall We
Dance?'' ``Hello Young Lovers'' ``I Whistle a Happy Tune'' and ``I
Have Dreamed,'' which are among Rodgers and Hammerstein's best,
it's hard to completely dismiss the animated feature. It helps that
the songs are delightfully sung by Christiane Noll, who starred in
the Broadway musical ``Jekyll and Hyde.'' If not for some odd
arrangements, she would have sounded as good as the legendary Marni
Nixon, who sang for Kerr as well as Audrey Hepburn in ``My Fair
Lady'' and Natalie Wood in ``West Side Story.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps some children will be drawn to Broadway classics through
this film. But do you really believe a flat animated character
could possibly replace the delightful image of the bald-headed Yul
Brynner dancing across the screen.?
</P>
<P>
   What were the filmmakers thinking?

STUDY BACKS MEDICINAL USE OF MARIJUANA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DOLORES KONG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A scientific study commissioned by the US drug czar Wednesday
found marijuana can be useful in treating people with AIDS, cancer
and other diseases, adding fire to the already politically charged
issue of whether to legalize the drug for medicinal purposes.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Institute of Medicine report found no
evidence to support the theory that marijuana is a ``gateway'' to
harder drugs of abuse, and urged further study of marijuana's
active ingredients in treating pain, nausea and other symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   The $896,000 study was commissioned in 1997 by retired Army Gen.
Barry R. McCaffrey, Clinton's antidrug policy adviser, after he and
other US officials criticized state ballot measures legalizing
medical marijuana as ``hoax initiatives,'' and dismissed claims for
the drug's benefits as a ``Cheech &AMP; Chong show,'' referring to
comedians who have glamorized drug use.
</P>
<P>
   The Institute of Medicine is a private non-profit organization
that provides health policy advice under a congressional charter.
</P>
<P>
   Its report concludes that the future of the drug's medicinal use
lies not in lighting up joints, since smoking can lead to lung
damage and low-birthweight babies, but in the development of
pharmaceuticals or other drug delivery systems, like a vaporizer,
that would be based on marijuana's active ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the report did support interim solutions for
some sick and dying patients who do not benefit from approved
painkillers and anti-nausea drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are limited circumstances in which we see recommending
smoked marijuana for medical uses,'' said Dr. John A. Benson Jr.,
former dean of Oregon Health Sciences Unversity and one of the two
principal investigators for the report. But he said this would be
only in the context of a carefully controlled study in which
patients are told of the potential harmful effects.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of patients with nausea and vomiting from
chemotherapy, for example, could be among those who could benefit
from smoked marijuana in carefully controlled trials, Benson said
during a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, McCaffrey highlighted the report's conclusion
that, ``the future of cannabinoid drugs lies not in smoked
marijuana, but in chemically defined drugs that act on ...human
physiology.'' He doubted the findings are likely to send
pharmaceutical companies scrambling to do research on marijuana.
``Our experience is there is little market interest.''
</P>
<P>
   The report did not find evidence to support the use of marijuana
to reduce some of the eye pressure that comes with glaucoma,
however, even though people have anecdotally reported it to be
helpful.
</P>
<P>
   One scientist asked by the institute to review the report, Dr.
Lester Grinspoon of Harvard Medical School and author of
``Marihuana: The Forbidden Medicine,'' said he found fault with the
glaucoma finding and other conclusions, but overall backed it
because ``it does say unequivocally that marijuana has medicinal
capacities.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, other supporters of the legal use of marijuana for
medical purposes also welcomed the report. And AIDS groups used the
report to demand that federal officials immediately allow
experimental access to medical marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this report is Gen. McCaffrey's worst nightmare,''
said Bill Zimmerman, executive director of the California-based
Americans for Medical Rights, which has sponsored successful
medical marijuana initiatives in seven states, mostly out West, and
has put one on Maine's ballot for November.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of what the government has been telling us is false . . .
It's not a gateway to heroin and cocaine. It has proven medical
value,'' said Zimmerman, whose group is funded by, among others,
financier George Soros. ``I think from both a scientific and moral
standpoint, government has no choice but to make it available for
patients who need it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Antidrug activists generally called the report an objective
evaluation, but continued to oppose the state initiatives as
political ploys by people seeking to have all marijuana use
legalized.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gen. McCaffrey has been wonderfully responsible and responsive
to fund this report and to get the medical community injected into
this issue,'' said Steve Dnistrian, executive vice president for
the Partnership for a Drug-Free America, a private non-profit
organization known for its national antidrug advertising campaigns.
``The best thing is to have this issue pulled out of the political
arena, and put into the scientific arena.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dnistrian said the report's findings could still send the
wrong message about marijuana to children. Imagine a situation in
which a parent discusses marijuana with a son and discovers that
the teen-ager ``has just been offered a joint at school, and a
friend tells him, `It can't be so bad, sick people use it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be inherently more difficult for that parent to
talk to that kid persuasively about marijuana,'' Dnistrian said.
``It's not impossible to deal with, it just makes it all the more
complicated.'' He also disputed the conclusion that marijuana does
not play a role in teen-agers progressing to harder drugs.
</P>
<P>
   While the Institute of Medicine report supports limited use of
smoked marijuana for some patients, federal agencies, including the
White House Office of National Drug Control Policy that McCaffrey
heads up, remained silent on whether they would expand experimental
access to the drug outside of some small federally approved
programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will carefully study the recommendations and conclusions
contained in this report,'' said McCaffrey, who then deferred to
the US Department of Health and Human Services.
</P>
<P>
   Health and Human Services, in its own statement, said the
National Institutes of Health, which it oversees, ``will continue
to consider any grant applications it receives on the medical
utility of marijuana and its constituents, and is prepared to fund
those applications that meet the accepted standards of scientific
design and are found, on the basis of peer review, to be
competitive with other applications that qualify for funding.''
</P>
<P>
   For Massachusetts public health officials, however, such
statements do not appear to go far enough.
</P>
<P>
   More than a year ago, the state Department of Public Health
petitioned the federal government for the right to study medical
marijuana, as allowed under state law. But the DPH's Dr. Alfred
DeMaria said it has gotten the runaround from the National
Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug Administration and the Drug
Enforcement Administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only legal supply is through the NIH, the NIH will only
release it if there is an FDA-approved protocol and FDA will only
approve a protocol if DEA approves the supply of marijuana,''
DeMaria said. ``It's one of those circular things.''

REPORT BACKS MEDICAL MARIJUANA WHEN OTHER THERAPIES FAIL
</HEADLINE>
   (wg) 
 By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The active ingredients in marijuana appear to be
useful for treating pain, nausea and the severe weight loss
associated with AIDS, according to a new study commissioned by the
government that is intensifying the contentious debate over whether
doctors should be permitted to prescribe the drug.
</P>
<P>
   The report, the most comprehensive analysis to date of the
medical literature about marijuana, said there was no evidence that
giving the drug to sick people would increase illicit use in the
general population. Nor is marijuana a ``gateway drug'' that
prompts patients to use harder drugs like cocaine and heroin, the
study said.
</P>
<P>
   The authors of the study, a panel of 11 independent experts at
the Institute of Medicine, a branch of the National Academy of
Sciences, cautioned that the benefits of smoking marijuana were
limited because the smoke itself was so toxic. Yet at the same
time, they recommended that the drug be given, on a short-term
basis under close supervision, to patients who did not respond to
other therapies.
</P>
<P>
   The release of the delicately worded report, at a morning press
conference here, prompted a flurry of political maneuvering.
Proponents of state initiatives to legalize marijuana for medical
purposes seized upon the findings as long-awaited evidence that it
had therapeutic value. They called on the Clinton administration,
and in particular Gen. Barry McCaffrey, director of the Office of
National Drug Control Policy, which requested the study, to ease
its steadfast opposition to the initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``This report has proved McCaffrey wrong,'' said Chuck Thomas, a
spokesman for the Marijuana Policy Project, a nonprofit
organization in Washington that lobbies for the legalization of
medical marijuana. ``We never said marijuana was a panacea and a be
all or end all. What we have said is there are some patients who
don't respond to existing medications, and this report confirms
that.''
</P>
<P>
   But the study is unlikely to change the administration's
position. The Department of Health and Human Services, which is
already financing some research involving medical marijuana, issued
a written statement noting simply that it would continue to fund
the work. And McCaffrey, speaking in a telephone interview from Los
Angeles, said, ``This study seems to suggest that there is little
future in smoked marijuana.''
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey politely praised the analysis as a ``superb piece of
work'' and said he would take the recommendations under advisement.
But he said there was ``enormous confusion in law enforcement''
about how to handle the issue, and added, ``We've got people with
mischievous agendas at work.''
</P>
<P>
   While the study's authors said they had been surprised to
discover ``an explosion of new scientific knowledge about how the
active components of marijuana affect the body,'' they added
pointedly that the future of marijuana as a medicine does not lie
in smoking it. Marijuana smoke, they said, is even more toxic than
tobacco smoke, and can cause cancer, lung damage and complications
during pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   The true benefits of marijuana, the experts said, would only be
realized when alternative methods, like capsules, patches and
bronchial inhalers, were developed to deliver its active
components, called cannabinoids, to the body without the harmful
effects of smoke.
</P>
<P>
   So far, there is only one cannabinoid-based drug on the market,
Marinol, manufactured by Unimed of Somerville, N.J. It comes in
pill form and was approved in May 1985 by the Food and Drug
Administration for nausea and vomiting associated with
chemotherapy, as well as for anorexia and weight loss associated
with AIDS. Some patients have complained that marinol is more
expensive than marijuana and that they do not feel its effects as
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The researchers recommended that the government pay for research
that would speed up the development of more cannabinoid drugs, and
were particularly keen on the promise of inhalers. But, recognizing
that such methods might take years to perfect, they also
recommended that people who did not respond to other therapy be
permitted to smoke marijuana in the interim.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marijuana should only be smoked in circumstances where the
long-term risks are not of great concern, such as for terminally
ill patients or those with debilitating symptoms that do not
respond to approved medications,'' said Dr. John A. Benson Jr.,
former dean of Oregon Health Sciences University School of Medicine
and one of the study's two lead authors. ``Even in these cases,
smoking should be limited to carefully controlled situations.''
</P>
<P>
   Benson and his co-author, Dr. Stanley J. Watson Jr. of the
Mental Health Research Institute of the University of Michigan,
unveiled their findings in a stately wood-paneled lecture hall at
the Institute of Medicine here. As the two scientists spoke, a
handful of people sat quietly in the audience, wearing fire-engine
red T-shirts with white block lettering that blared: ``Medical
Marijuana Patient.''
</P>
<P>
   Among them was Jim Hardin, a 48-year-old Virginia man who
testified before the panel and whose story was among several
personal anecdotes included in the report. Mr. Hardin suffers from
Hepatitis C, a disease that is destroying his liver, and uses a
wheelchair. He said smoking marijuana helped him cope with the
intense nausea and rapid weight loss the disease has caused.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost 95 pounds,'' Mr. Hardin said. ``I tried everything: 35
different pills. Finally doctors told me to go to Europe and try
marijuana.'' He did just that, in November 1997, visiting the
Netherlands, where a doctor prescribed one to two grams of
marijuana per day. Here in the United States, Mr. Hardin said, he
obtains the drug ``from a network of care providers that are
willing to grow a safe and clean cannabis.''
</P>
<P>
   Also in the audience was Joyce Nalepka of America Cares, a
parents' antidrug group based in Maryland that has been critical of
efforts to legalize marijuana for medical use.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm concerned about the message we are sending,'' Ms. Nalepka
said. ``Kids interpret things differently than adults. What they're
going to hear is, `Marijuana is good for something.'''
</P>
<P>
   The report contained some surprising findings. It concluded
that, despite popular belief, marijuana was not useful in treating
glaucoma. While the drug can reduce some of the eye pressure
associated with glaucoma, the effects were short-lived, the report
found, and did not outweigh the long-term hazards of using the
drug.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the study found that there was little evidence for
marijuana's potential in treating movement disorders like
Parkinson's disease or Huntington's disease, but that it was
effective in combating the muscle spasms associated with multiple
sclerosis.
</P>
<P>
   So far, voters in seven states _ California, Alaska, Arizona,
Colorado, Nevada, Oregon and Washington _ have approved initiatives
intended to make marijuana legal for medical purposes. But doctors
are often afraid to write prescriptions because the federal
government has threatened to prosecute them, and patients often
have difficulty obtaining the drug, in part because the government
has moved to shut the marijuana buyers clubs that had been
distributing it. In the District of Columbia, meanwhile, the
November ballot contained a proposal to legalize medical marijuana,
but Congress intervened and prevented the vote from being counted.

FORD EXCURSION HEADS INTO SUBURBAN COUNTRY, LOOKING FOR A SALES
FIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 
(For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) By BARBARA POWELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Ford Motor Co. has waltzed into the heart of
Chevrolet/GMC Suburban country to strut its own giant sport utility
vehicle, the bigger, longer Ford Excursion.
</P>
<P>
   Texas consumers _ who bought 23 percent of the 151,356 Suburbans
sold last year _ are the first to climb up into the nearly 19-feet
long Excursion, whose four-wheel drive version is featured at the
Dallas Auto Show this week.
</P>
<P>
   Ford dealers, already reaping strong sales with the smaller, but
still large, Expedition, gleefully await deliveries of the
Excursion and the chance to challenge the Suburban, which has been
hauling loads for 64 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This puts the cream on the pie for our lineup'' said Mickey
McHale, president of Hillard Auto Group in Ford Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Ford deliberately chose a market that loves trucks for the
public unveiling of the Excursion, which was announced in February.
Prestige Ford in suburban Dallas, for example, is the world's
leader in Ford F-Series truck sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why wouldn't we want to come to Texas, the truck capital of
the world, to show this vehicle? This is Ford country,'' Ford
Division President Jim O'Connor told a group of 75 Texas and
Oklahoma Ford dealers who gawked and grinned at the toreador red
Excursion on display Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors isn't taking Ford's challenge lying down.
</P>
<P>
   It will unveil a slightly disguised redesign of the Chevy
Suburban and GMC Yukon at the March 30 New York Auto Show. But it
is saving the complete unveiling of the redesigned Suburban and its
smaller siblings, the GMC Yukon and the Chevy Tahoe, for the Texas
State Fair in September, just a few weeks before the Excursion goes
on sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Texas, we're very much in the fight,'' GM spokesman Craig
Eppling said.
</P>
<P>
   The first Excursions will hit the market in October. The
Suburban and Tahoe/Yukon redesigns will go on sale in late winter.
</P>
<P>
   GM is already riding high with Suburban sales. In 1998, GMC and
Chevrolet dealers sold 151,356 Suburbans, the model's best year
ever, despite a strike that shut down production for nearly two
months. Nationally, the Expedition outsold it in 1998, with
225,705.
</P>
<P>
   But GM had the edge in Texas, where it sold nearly 35,000 Chevy
or GMC Suburbans, Eppling said, while Ford sold nearly 29,000
Expeditions and its upscale twin, Lincoln Navigators.
</P>
<P>
   Area Ford dealers say they're ready for a fight. Their only
gripe is that they won't be allotted as many Excursions as they
could sell; Ford only plans to make 50,000 to 60,000 Excursions for
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Ford dealers say the Excursion will draw Suburban owners, buyers
moving up from the Expedition and other smaller vehicles, as well
as commercial accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there will be a big market for commercial use,'' said
Ken Nichols, owner of Nichols Ford in Fort Worth. ``It will be a
great carpool vehicle. We would put it in our rental fleet also.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Reynolds, whose Prestige Ford sold 405 Expeditions in
1998, says the Excursion will attract two types of customers: ``The
executive who wants the biggest, baddest SUV out there, and also
the female buyer who carries a lot of kids who wants something big
and safe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Both buyers will come from Suburbans and Expeditions,'' he
added. ``I don't think you will see any first-time SUV buyers.''
</P>
<P>
   John Dee Sledge, owner of Cleburne Ford southwest of Fort Worth,
said the 76.5-inch height for the two-wheel drive model or the
79.5-inch four-wheel drive model height won't be a problem for most
of his customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of farm and ranch people here who will be
parking outside anyway,'' Sledge said. ``But I imagine it will be a
little hard to park in the Metroplex.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Ford's eagerness for battle, auto industry analyst Jim
Wangers said the Excursion won't hurt the Suburban's market. GM,
mindful of federal requirements on producing fuel-efficient
vehicles, has never made as many Suburbans as motorists wanted to
buy, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Ford will take some folk from the Tahoe and the Yukon,
and they may get those who already have a Suburban and find they
have to wait for a new one,'' Wangers said.
</P>
<P>
   And Chevy dealers aren't willingly giving ground.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Lowrie, owner of Bruce Lowrie Chevrolet in Fort Worth,
said he is used to competing with his neighbor, Ken Nichols of
Nichols Ford. Lowrie said most of his customers are confirmed
Chevrolet owners who won't switch to a Ford.
</P>
<P>
   ``Customers, at least ours, very seldom change brands,'' Lowrie
said.
</P>
<P>
   And that probably means there's plenty of room for both brands.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Stapp, sales manager for Pioneer Aggregates in the Dallas
suburb of Irving and arena director for the Houston Livestock Show
&AMP; Rodeo, drives a Ford F250 Crew Cab. He has owned a Suburban, but
says he may buy an Excursion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like Fords,'' said Stapp, who has seen pictures of the
Excursion and plans to go to the Dallas show to see the one on
display. ``Plus this has got the size to hook up a trailer any
size, and the comfort and luxury to take a trip in. This will blow
right past the Suburban.''
</P>
<P>
   But Chad Hullender, who drives a 1992 Suburban, said he has no
interest in an Excursion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really care for Fords,'' said Hullender, a resident of
the Fort Worth suburb of Arlington, and a senior customer service
representative for an airline. ``And bigger than this (his
Suburban) isn't necessarily better.''

U.S. APPROVES ACCORD IN CASE AGAINST INTEL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Federal Trade Commission approved a settlement
Wednesday of its antitrust case against Intel Corp., the world's
largest maker of computer chips.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, reached last week, settles the government's
complaint that Intel violated federal law by retaliating against
three computer makers that had accused Intel of violating their
patent rights. After the patent dispute arose, Intel withheld
valuable technical information that was essential for the computer
makers to develop the latest models of personal computers and
specialized work stations.
</P>
<P>
   Intel resolved the dispute with the FTC by agreeing to an order
that limits the giant chip maker from withholding crucial technical
details about its chips when it becomes embroiled in patent
disputes with some of its customers.
</P>
<P>
   While the order prohibits Intel from denying the technical
information as a way of maintaining the company's dominant market
position, it does permit Intel to withhold the information for
legitimate business reasons unrelated to the patent disputes. For
instance, Intel can withhold the information from computer makers
who are not paying their bills or are developing competing
microprocessors. Intel may also cut off information to a company
that, in violation of nondisclosure agreements, leaks details of
the technology to third parties.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, computer companies seeking injunctions to block Intel
from selling its chips as part of their patent disputes would not
be protected by the order.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC had accused Intel of withholding the information from
computer makers to coerce them into handing over their innovations
to Intel. The technical chip information is the lifeblood for
computer makers. But in three cases, the government said, Intel
withheld the information after the computer companies _ Compaq
Computer, Digital Equipment and Intergraph _ had complained that
Intel was infringing on their patents.
</P>
<P>
   Intel contested the government's accusation that the company
``sought to extort'' technology from its customers ``in order to
preserve its monopoly.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission voted 3-0 to accept the agreement for public
comment. If the commission follows its usual practice, it is all
but certain to make the agreement final after a 60-day public
comment period.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Pitofsky, the chairman of the FTC, said the settlement
upheld the principle that ``a monopolist cannot withhold products
or information about products in order to retaliate against
customers who find themselves in intellectual property disputes.''
</P>
<P>
   The order, Pitofsky said in an interview, sets up a ``balanced
approach'' that enables Intel and its potential rivals to negotiate
and litigate patent issues in the courts while stripping Intel of
its ability to cripple a possible rival.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intel can do what they need to do for legitimate business
reasons,'' Pitofsky said. ``But they cannot make the potential
rivals bend at their will.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of the settlement, the agency reached no conclusion
about whether Intel is a monopoly, a finding that would have had
broad legal consequences for the company by enabling rivals and
customers to file their own suits. But it seemed clear that senior
officials had concluded that Intel, whose chips power more than 80
percent of personal computers, was a monopoly. If the company were
not a monopoly, then it could have lawfully retaliated against
potential rivals by withholding the technical information.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The settlement was praised by executives of Intel and
Intergraph, which makes specialized workstations and was the
company hit hardest by the Intel dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although we have different interpretations regarding Intel's
market position and the legality of our past actions, the
compromise provides a framework for resolving future intellectual
property disputes with our customers,'' said Craig Barrett, the
president of Intel.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at Intergraph said the settlement vindicated the
accusations they had made in a separate civil lawsuit that Intel
was heavy-handed when it cut off Intergraph from the technology. In
that suit, Intel has denied Intergraph's accusations of fraud,
theft of trade secrets and anti-competitive conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you give in to a consent decree, it's an admission
that you did something wrong,'' said James Meadlock, the chairman
and chief executive of Intergraph. ``The settlement is clearly
consistent with the opinion by the judge in our case,'' who found
that Intel violated its duties as a monopolist not to misuse its
market power.
</P>
<P>
   The judge's findings came in an early opinion in a case that is
set to be tried next February.
</P>
<P>
   Intel executives and officials at the FTC said the settlement
would have no effect on a broader antitrust investigation of the
company that has been under way at the agency.
</P>
<P>
   The agency has been examining a variety of Intel's business
practices, including the contract restrictions imposed on customers
through nondisclosure agreements, Intel's control of industry
standards, and the special pricing agreements and restrictions
required of computer makers as part of Intel's ``Intel Inside''
marketing campaign.

SENATE BILL PLEDGES DEFENSE AGAINST MISSILES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Reacting to warnings that missiles from several
emerging nations could soon be capable of hitting the United
States, the Senate Wednesday pledged to build a national defense
system as soon as the technology is developed, overcoming earlier
opposition from Democrats and the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The national missile defense bill said virtually nothing about
how that system would work, how much it cost, or when it would be
ready. But it cemented the Senate's commitment to defend against
missile attack in all 50 states, raising the profile of a plan that
has been discussed in various forms since 1983.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, which the Senate overwhelmingly approved 97 to
3, comes on the heels of several unexpected missile launches
abroad, including a medium-range ballistic missile tested by North
Korea last August and similar tests by Iran. The fear is that those
nations will soon have the capacity to fire rockets to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Thad Cochran, the Mississippi Republican who sponsored
the bill, lauded the Senate for taking ``the necessary first step
to protecting the United States from long-range ballistic missile
attack.''
</P>
<P>
   But the political landscape played a key role in the bill's
swift passage as well, several senators said. Despite strong
opposition to the same bill last year _ and the threat that
President Clinton might veto this one _ Democrats Wednesday offered
their support.
</P>
<P>
   They did so in part because the Senate passed an amendment
promising the system would not disturb arms control negotiations
with Russia _ a key concern as the Russian Parliament debates
whether to sign the second strategic arms reduction treaty. Russian
officials have indicated they will refuse to sign the treaty, Start
2, if the US shifts the balance of nuclear power with a massive
defense system.
</P>
<P>
   But by passing the amended bill, Democrats also denied
Republicans the opportunity to use national missile defense as a
political issue in the 2000 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Jack Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island, said there was a
``real, substantive reason'' to bring the system to the top of the
list of foreign policy concerns, citing tests by Iran and North
Korea as reasons ``this has become a front-burner issue.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But the Republicans certainly have a real political reason to
start talking about it,'' he said. ``It allows them to play to
their strengths at this particular moment.''
</P>
<P>
   The system, which remains largely undeveloped, uses a
combination of sensors, trackers and a defense missile to monitor
the location of enemy missiles and shoot them down. Analysts say it
is analagous to ``hitting a bullet with a bullet'' _ and is equally
difficult, part of the reason the more than $40 billion spent on
building the program so far has led to relatively few results.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, three Democratic senators voted against the bill:
Senators Patrick Leahy of Vermont, Paul Wellstone of Minnesota and
Richard Durbin of Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States Senate, with this vote, is virtually giving
a blank check to this project,'' Durbin said. ``It would give us a
false sense of security and be completely ineffective.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Massachusetts senators voted in favor of the bill, even
though Senator John F. Kerry voiced concerns about ``the building
of a system that simply creates greater unrest, greater
instability, greater question marks.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill is expected to meet equally few opponents in the House
of Representatives, where it is scheduled to be voted upon
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, Democrat of Missouri,
said there were concerns among Democrats that the Republicans were
``trying to take this beyond what the President intended.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The President has decided to do something, but the minute you
do that, the Republicans want to run off and turn it into Star Wars
again,'' Gephardt said in a telephone interview, referring to the
wide-ranging space laser initiative first promoted by President
Ronald Reagan in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Other Democrats voiced different concerns _ particularly
budgetary ones. Calling the initiative a ``political gambit,''
Representative Barney Frank accused House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert
of seizing on a no-brainer issue in order to ``claim they
accomplished some things.''
</P>
<P>
   But the cost will soon outweigh the benefit, particularly
because no missile defense system has yet been developed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if I did a census of the older women in my district,
more of them would be afraid of the adverse consequences of other
things besides getting bopped on the head with a nuclear missile
from Korea,'' said Frank, a Democrat from Massachusetts. ``The
money they want to use for this is taken from every other piece of
the budget, including defense.''

ANTI-APARTHEID CLERIC IS GUILTY OF STEALING MONEY FROM CHARITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ The former anti-apartheid activist
Allan Boesak was found guilty Wednesday of stealing hundreds of
thousands of dollars donated to his foundation. The money was
supposed to help needy children and to educate black voters before
South Africa's first all-race election in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   A judge found Boesak guilty of three counts of theft and one of
fraud, saying he had used money given to him for charitable
purposes ``as if it was his own'' to buy two luxury homes and a
radio studio for his second wife, Elna, among other things.
</P>
<P>
   Boesak, once one of South Africa's liberation heroes, sat
stone-faced as the judge, John Foxcroft, read his lengthy decision.
He was originally charged with 32 counts of theft and fraud; five
were dismissed, and he was acquitted on the other 23.
</P>
<P>
   Boesak's case has gripped this nation in part because it has
offered a peek at the former cleric's lavish style during the early
1990s, and in part because President Nelson Mandela intervened
several times to help him.
</P>
<P>
   When Boesak first returned to South Africa from the United
States to face trial, Mandela sent his justice minister, Dullah
Omar, to meet him at the airport. Later, when Boesak ran out of
money to pay his lawyers, Mandela raised funds for him and
criticized the prosecutor's case.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela later apologized for his remarks. He was in Norway
Wednesday and had no comment on the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Boesak had maintained that all he was guilty of was ``struggle
bookkeeping.'' And in arriving at his verdict, Foxcroft
acknowledged that in some cases proper records of how donations
were being used could not be kept because of the close attention of
the security police.
</P>
<P>
   But the judge found that in several cases Boesak had used money
donated to his Foundation for Peace and Justice ``as his own.''
</P>
<P>
   The charges of theft and fraud are not Boesak's first brush with
scandal. A fiery speaker against apartheid in the 1980s, Boesak
came to prominence when he became the head of the World Alliance of
Reformed Churches. But he was forced to resign in 1990, when news
broke that he was having an extramarital affair.
</P>
<P>
   He was not abandoned by the ruling African National Congress,
however. Boesak had been appointed South Africa's representative at
the United Nations in Geneva when the charges of theft and fraud
surfaced in 1994. He was forced to leave that job and soon moved to
the United States, where he was a fellow at the American Baptist
Seminary of the West in Berkeley, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   During the trial many prominent South Africans who had been
board members for Boesak's foundation testified that they believed
they were deliberately kept in the dark about what was happening to
the money. Some said they had resigned because of the problems. But
other witnesses were clearly reluctant to speak out against a man
they admired.
</P>
<P>
   The courtroom was packed with Boesak's supporters, and once or
twice there were shouts of ``Viva Boesak!'' But mostly the crowd
remained silent.
</P>
<P>
   Boesak and his wife refused to comment after the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   The court adjourned until next Tuesday for the lawyers to
prepare their arguments for sentencing.

SERBS' KILLING OF 40 ALBANIANS RULED A CRIME AGAINST HUMANITY

<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ The 40 ethnic Albanians killed in the
village of Racak in January were all unarmed civilians, and their
slaying amounted to a crime against humanity, the head of a Finnish
forensic team that examined the bodies said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The team leader, Dr. Helena Ranta, whose group performed
autopsies on the victims, announced the findings here in Kosovo's
capital after handing her report to the Serbian authorities. She
called for a criminal investigation of the killings and prosecution
of the perpetrators.
</P>
<P>
   The report sharply contradicts the official Serbian version of
the incident. And just as Belgrade has stepped up its military
campaign in Kosovo and effectively stonewalled peace talks, it also
turns the spotlight on Serbia's conduct in its southern province.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a crime against humanity, yes,'' Ranta told a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   She said the report would be submitted to the International War
Crimes Tribunal in The Hague.
</P>
<P>
   The Racak killings represented a turning point in the war. Upon
hearing of the killings, William Walker, the American leading the
observer mission sponsored by the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe, said the Serbian security forces had
massacred the Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Walker was threatened with expulsion, and Serbia was threatened
with NATO air strikes, setting off the chain of events leading to
the first peace talks between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
   Serbian authorities had said at the time that their forces had
killed the people in a gun battle or in crossfire and that the dead
were members of the separatist Kosovo Liberation Army that is
battling the government forces.
</P>
<P>
   But the Finnish team concluded that ``there were no indications
of the people being other than unarmed civilians.'' Among those
examined, there were several elderly men and one woman, Ranta said.
Their clothes bore no insignia of a military unit, and there was no
sign that badges or insignia had been removed, a summary of the
report stated.
</P>
<P>
   No ammunition was found on the victims, and a test for traces of
gunpowder was negative. ``It is most likely there was no fight,''
Ranta said.
</P>
<P>
   The report also said that the clothes of the victims, marked as
they were with bullet holes and congealed blood, could not have
been changed or removed. This contradicts the official Serbian
suggestion that the Albanians had removed the guerrillas' uniforms
and dressed them as civilians to stage an apparent massacre.
</P>
<P>
   Ranta emphasized that the 22 bodies found in a narrow gully
above the village had not been moved, although most had been turned
over when villagers first found them. ``They were most likely shot
where they were found,'' she said, further discounting Serbian
accusations of a setup.
</P>
<P>
   The dead were all killed by shooting and by more than one
bullet, she said. One body bore wounds from 30 bullets, Ranta said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the exhaustive documentation, Ranta refused to draw
conclusions as to the manner of death. She said it was not her role
as a scientist to ascertain whether the killings were a massacre.
</P>
<P>
   She said she had not visited the gully herself, which lies 25
miles southwest of Pristina, and so could not judge the distance
from which the victims were killed.

ENERGY SECRETARY ANNOUNCES STEPS TO TIGHTEN SECURITY AT NUCLEAR
LABS
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By JAMES RISEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Energy Department has begun an internal
investigation into accusations that its chief of intelligence was
improperly barred from briefing Congress last year about
allegations that China stole data from a nuclear weapons
laboratory, Secretary Bill Richardson announced on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The department's inspector general, Greg Friedman, will review
whether Elizabeth Moler, who was acting energy secretary at the
time, prevented Notra Trulock, then the intelligence chief, from
giving information about possible Chinese espionage to the House
Select Committee on Intelligence in July 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation announced on Wednesday is in response to
criticism of how the administration handled evidence that China had
stolen nuclear secrets from Los Alamos National Laboratory, in New
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Ms. Moler prevented Trulock from briefing the
House panel because the information could have been used to
criticize President Clinton's policy on China.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Moler has said she does not recall the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson also announced six other steps intended to improve
security at nuclear weapons laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony on Wednesday to the Senate Select Committee on
Intelligence, he said his department would ask for $8 million more
in next year's counterintelligence budget for a new computer
security program for systems at the labs, which are owned by the
Energy Department.
</P>
<P>
   The department also plans to invest in systems to analyze
sensitive e-mail leaving the labs and other Energy Department
facilities, and will impose stricter controls on laboratory
documents that contain data on weapons design.
</P>
<P>
   With the new request for funds for electronic security, the
department is seeking to increase its counterintelligence budget
for fiscal 2000, which begins Oct. 1, to $39.2 million, more than
double last year's spending.
</P>
<P>
   In response to widespread criticism of the failure of the labs
to conduct background checks on thousands of visitors from
so-called sensitive countries like China, Russia and Iran, John
Deutch, the former director of central intelligence, is to review
the security of the visitors' programs.
</P>
<P>
   His review will be in addition to the broader assessment of the
case being conducted by the CIA and an outside panel led by David
Jeremiah, a retired admiral.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said the department will report annually to Congress
on its foreign visitors and its counterintelligence efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The department's office of counterintelligence also plans an
extensive review of old investigative files in order to identify
cases that should be examined further.

CENSUS BILLS ADVANCE IN HOUSE DESPITE BUREAU'S PROTESTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (ATTN: Calif., Fla., N.Y.)  
(rk) 
 By   JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After engaging in heated and partisan debate on how
best to manage the 2000 census, a House committee approved several
Republican-sponsored bills Wednesday over objections by the Census
Bureau's director that they would be ``just short of disastrous''
and could even delay the beginning of the count.
</P>
<P>
   The most contentious of the proposals would require the bureau
to recount the population of municipalities that challenge its
figures. Opponents said this would delay completion of the count by
nine weeks, conceivably jeopardizing timely redistricting in some
states, and would be less effective than working closely with local
governments before the counting begins.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans on the House panel, the government Reform Committee,
said their proposals would insure as accurate a count as possible
without recourse to statistical sampling, whose use in the census
is opposed by Republicans and was restricted by a Supreme Court
ruling in January.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats accused the sponsors of ``micromanaging'' the
Census Bureau and conspiring to bog it down in wasteful operations
that they said would do little to correct the undercounting of
minorities.
</P>
<P>
   The counting of minorities has become a highly divisive issue,
mainly because, since they tend to vote Democratic, larger counts
of them could benefit Democrats by helping determine the number of
seats each state gets in the House and how the lines of
congressional districts are drawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear to me that they are trying to delay the census to
death,'' Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney, D-N.Y., said of the sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   But the chief sponsor, Rep. Dan Miller, R-Fla., accused the
Census Bureau of refusing to come up with plans that did not rely
on sampling to get the most accurate count.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau argues that the package of bills approved
Wednesday would impose complicated and expensive requirements that
the agency does not have the time or the money to meet before the
count's start, scheduled for April 1 of next year.
</P>
<P>
   One provision, for instance, would require repeat mailings to
every household that does not respond to the initial one. Another
would require that census questionnaires be printed in 31
languages.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's Republican majority brushed aside Democratic
pleas that Kenneth Prewitt, the bureau's director, be allowed to
testify about his objection to the bills, some of which have never
been discussed at a congressional hearing.
</P>
<P>
   But in a memorandum released by the Democrats, Prewitt told
Commerce Secretary William M. Daley that the changes ``would
seriously undermine the ability of the bureau to complete an
accurate and timely census.''
</P>
<P>
   And in a letter to the committee's ranking Democrat, Rep. Henry
A. Waxman of California, Daley said he would recommend that
President Clinton veto the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the committee approved seven bills, with almost no
support from Democrats and little opposition from Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the full House approves the bills, they will face
substantial resistance in the Senate, where opponents could block a
vote with a filibuster. But with disagreements on how to manage the
census running so deep, and with the political stakes so high,
there is a chance that the House Republican leadership would attach
them to an important spending bill, forcing a confrontation with
the administration.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In his memo, Prewitt said the bill that would allow municipal
governments to demand an audit of a local census was ``neither
timely, effective, nor cost-efficient.'' Audits on demand were
permitted in the 1990 census but uncovered little of what was later
acknowledged to be significant undercountings.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Prewitt said, the bureau has adopted a program in
which, before the census begins, local officials update the
household addresses that the counters use. He said that twice as
many local governments were participating in this program than in
the old approach and that these governments accounted for 85
percent of the addresses in the country.
</P>
<P>
   On a few provisions, the two sides found common ground, as when
they agreed to let people receiving government assistance
temporarily work for the census without losing their benefits. But
for the most part, each side voiced mistrust of the other's
motives. Republicans said decisions were being made by Democratic
political appointees; Democrats said the bills were meant to paper
over Republican hostility to a full accounting of minorities.

 USWeb Moving Headquarters to the Gulch
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Jon Swartz &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
USWeb/CKS, a billion-dollar Internet consulting company, yesterday
said it is moving its headquarters from the South Bay to San
Francisco's Multimedia Gulch this summer.
</P>
<P>
   The company's executive team is heading north to be part of the
region's multimedia epicenter. It represents one of the biggest
recruiting coups yet for the burgeoning South of Market high-tech
neighborhood, city officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``San Francisco is a booming source for technology and creative
talent, which is critical as we continue to scale up over the
coming years,'' company CEO Robert Shaw said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the change of address is largely symbolic for the moment.
USWeb/CKS, now based in Santa Clara, will consolidate more than 300
employees already located in three downtown offices and import 100
more workers from other offices around the Bay Area to a four-story
building at 410 Townsend St., between Fifth and Sixth streets. The
fast-growing firm, which employs 2,250 people worldwide, will
maintain 200 administrative, financial and consulting positions in
Silicon Valley, according to a spokesman. USWeb/CKS has added 1,000
positions worldwide in the past year and plans to continue its
rapid expansion, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This move further solidifies the city as a hub for
multimedia,'' said Laura Paden, a spokeswoman for the San Francisco
Partnership, a public-private consortium formed to attract and
retain businesses in the city.
</P>
<P>
   The city's multimedia industry has mushroomed by some 6,000
full-time jobs _ to 17,600 _ over the past four years, according to
Paden. That total does not include another 17,000 high-tech
contract jobs in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   USWeb/CKS' 94,000-square-foot Townsend building is located down
the street from two other large tech employers: Sega of America and
Macromedia.
</P>
<P>
   Sega is the city's biggest high-tech recruit from Silicon Valley
so far. The computer-console game-maker started transferring an
estimated 800 employees from Redwood Shores earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen more interest (from prospective renters) in our
buildings the last six weeks than we have space to accommodate by
three or four times. The Internet industry has created a
real-estate boom in South of Market,'' said Douglas Rosenberg,
president of the Rosenberg Co., the San Francisco developer that
owns the USWeb/CKS building.
</P>
<P>
   ``USWeb/CKS is a welcome addition to San Francisco's high-tech
and Internet community,'' Mayor Willie Brown said in a statement.
``(It) represents the kind of innovative and forward-thinking
companies Multimedia Gulch continues to attract.''
</P>
<P>
   It is also surely one of the most colorful.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Firmage, 28, the company's eccentric founder, resigned in
January so he could promote his belief that many of today's
high-tech advancements, including semiconductors, optics and
lasers, came from aliens.
</P>
<P>
   USWeb merged last year with Net marketing firm CKS to form a
public company worth $2.1 billion. Its customers include Apple
Computer, Levi Strauss and Harley-Davidson.

 Shares of Williams-Sonoma Tumble 19%
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Carol Emert &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Williams-Sonoma Inc. stock swooned 19 percent yesterday on news of
a top executive's retirement and earnings that came in one penny
below projections.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Chantland, Williams-Sonoma's chief administrative officer
and an executive vice president, will retire July 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``At 56 years old, I've decided it's time to learn how to relax,
do some traveling and improve my golf handicap,'' he said in a
telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts credited Chantland, who is in charge of
finance and systems, with fattening Williams-Sonoma's margins,
improving its systems and lowering costs since joining the San
Francisco retailer in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement of his departure was made before the market
opened, and trading of Williams-Sonoma shares was delayed for two
hours. The first trade was made at $26.75, down from $36 at
Tuesday's close. Shares ended the day at $29, down from a 52-week
high of $40.75, reached on December 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market doesn't react to surprises very well,'' said
Chantland, who called yesterday's plunge an ``overreaction.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as Wall Street pummeled Williams-Sonoma's stock, the
company reported robust increases in both sales and profits.
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter ended January 31, net earnings hit $43.9 million
(75 cents per share), up from $34.3 million (61 cents) in last
year's fourth quarter. Analysts had expected per-share earnings of
76 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Sales at stores open at least a year grew 6 percent for the
quarter, while mail-order sales jumped 18.8 percent. Total sales
hit $441.2 million, a 19 percent increase over the fourth quarter
of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   When Chantland joined Williams-Sonoma, selling general and
administrative expenses represented about 35 percent of revenues.
Last year, they had fallen to 32.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Chantland ``has been the driving force behind those improvements
so people are a bit antsy,'' said Jason Klein, an analyst with
Blackford Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Chantland was an important player in overhauling the company's
inventory distribution systems, which were responsible for stock
outages and sales shortfalls in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Chantland said the company's Internet gift registry will go
online in May. The company continues to look for a buyer for its
catalog Gardeners Eden, which has annual revenues of $20 million to
$25 million, he said.
</P>
<P>
   For the 1998 fiscal year, also reported yesterday,
Williams-Sonoma announced a sales increase of 18.3 percent to $1.1
billion on a 21.5 percent increase in retail square footage.
Comparable store sales rose 5 percent, while mail order sales grew
15.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Net earnings, meanwhile, rose 33 percent to $54.9 million (96
cents per share) from $41.3 million (75 cents, adjusted to reflect
a stock split) in fiscal 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Williams-Sonoma runs stores and catalogs under the
Williams-Sonoma, Pottery Barn and Hold Everything names, and
catalogs called Chambers and Gardeners Eden.

 Toddlers Discover Computers
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Dan Fost &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Harrison Eagle, 19 months old, doesn't talk much, but he does share
his emotions freely. And this much is clear: He loves his BabyWow
software.
</P>
<P>
   When it is in the computer, he is happily banging away on the
keyboard, squealing with delight at the bananas and giraffes and
other simple images and words coming from the PC.
</P>
<P>
   And when his mom closes the program, he does what any Silicon
Valley toddler would do: He cries until she restarts it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He sees everybody on the computer, and he wants to be on the
computer,'' said Barbara Eagle, his San Jose mom who runs a film
and video production company with her husband.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to take advantage of an untapped niche in the crowded
consumer software market _ and of parents who want to get their
kids on the high-tech fast track _ companies have recently started
pitching computer games for children as young as 9 months.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of software for children under age 4 grew 50 percent last
year to $13 million, according to Ann Stephens, president of PC
Data, a market research firm in Reston, Va.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's growing fast,'' she said. ``Who's making the decisions?
It's not the kids. It's parents who don't want their kids left
behind. How you can be left behind when you're 9 months old is
beyond me, but so be it.''
</P>
<P>
   Child-development experts say that parents should mellow out and
let their infants and toddlers make mud pies or play with blocks,
and that getting babies hooked on computers doesn't guarantee
they'll get into MIT.
</P>
<P>
   But the experts, and the software-makers, say that if used only
occasionally, for brief periods, with a parent around, such
programs can be a healthy part of a child's development.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should be seen as another toy, but one with limited value
in the early years,'' said Claire Lerner, a child development
specialist with Zero to Three, a Washington, D.C., nonprofit
organization.
</P>
<P>
   Lerner said puzzles, wooden blocks and walks in the woods are
preferable to spending time with a computer. ``If your child does
not play on the computer in the first two years, it's not going to
hurt the child's development,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Candace Kaye, a lecturer in the department of teacher education
at California State University at Long Beach, is skeptical of the
software.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a baby is between zero and 2, children respond to the
environment with their senses and their physical interaction,''
Kaye said. ``I wonder how many children will be tasting the
keyboard or the screen? Can a baby get their hands around it? Can
they enfold it and play with it? This may be a wonderful addendum.
My concern is (that) this would be a primary thing for some
parents.''
</P>
<P>
   The software, most of which sells for $20 to $25, all work
basically the same way, according to Stephens at PC Data: ``You
whack the thing and you watch it.''
</P>
<P>
   Software-makers say this simple system gives children
familiarity with the computer, if nothing else.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't believe software is meant to be a replacement for
traditional learning activities,'' said Debbie Galdin, a
spokeswoman for the Learning Co., a Cambridge, Mass., company that
makes Reader Rabbit's Toddler software for children ages 18 months
to 3 years. It also makes Sesame Street Toddlers Deluxe, which is
designed for children ages 2 to 4.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which has divisions in the Bay Area, developed the
products to meet customer demand, she said. ``Because kids this age
do love to emulate their parents, it's important to have something
on the market that lets them do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Knowledge Adventure, another children's software-maker, last
year extended its popular JumpStart educational line with JumpStart
Baby, for children as young as 9 months. The company also sells
Play with the Teletubbies software, based on the hit television
show, for children ages 1 to 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``We definitely view this software as lapware,'' said Jennifer
Johnson, a spokeswoman for Knowledge Adventure, a division of the
French firm Havas Interactive. ``It's not a baby sitter, but
something parents and children should use together.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony Fernandes, maker of BabyWow, said he was inspired by his
son, Sean, who was born in July 1995. ``He was really curious about
the computer, probably because I spent a lot of time on it,''
Fernandes said.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, there was no software for children under age 3 on
the market. So Fernandes wrote a program for Sean, ``so that when
he pressed the keyboard, he'd see certain things pop up. He liked
that.''
</P>
<P>
   As he heard similar stories from other Silicon Valley parents,
Fernandes decided there might be a market for baby software.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; After researching child development and the software market,
Fernandes, a software &UR;  &LR; designer, quit his job at Netscape
Communications Corp. in February 1998 and started a company, BowWow
House, with his own money.
</P>
<P>
   By August, he had launched BabyWow. In the program, no matter
what key a toddler presses, something happens on screen: a giraffe
appears, or it  &LR; the program counts up to 10 bananas, or it
introduces concepts like ``behind'' or ``in front.''
</P>
<P>
   Parents can run the program in eight languages, in case they are
multilingual or just want to teach their toddler a second language.
</P>
<P>
   BabyWow, on CD-ROM, is only for sale through his  &LR; Fernandes' Web
site,  &LR; www.babywow.com &LR; . He plans to release three new programs for
kids ages 1 to 4 this year.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Sean is approaching his fourth birthday, Fernandes and
his wife and business partner, Kathy, have a new product tester,
1-year-old Ryan. ``He is the leading edge of refinement,''
Fernandes said. ``We need to keep reproducing.''
</P>
<P>
   Fernandes is accustomed to strident criticism from people who
don't like the idea of software for babies. His answer to
critics: &UR;  &LR; ``The computer is part of their environment. The computer
is going to be there in the home. The only question is, should we
put something on it to reward their curiosity?''

 Column: Salon Hoping to Attract More Web Surfers
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Dan Fost &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Salon is getting a makeover.
</P>
<P>
   That sounds like it might be bad news for loyalists, who love
the San Francisco online literary magazine for its writerly
craftsmanship; long, in-depth stories; and worldly array of topics.
</P>
<P>
   Those traits make Salon _ at  &LR; www.salonmagazine.com &LR;  _ stand out
compared to many other Web publications, which tend to be
hyperactive, up-to-the-minute accounts of technology news.
</P>
<P>
   So it might be disappointing to devotees that Salon's redesign
will include more tech news and up-to-the-minute reports _ exactly
what dozens of other computer-crazy Web sites already do.
</P>
<P>
   Salon says don't worry: It will still have its distinctive
voice, its literary bent and its wide array of topics. Editors say
the site mostly needs to change the way it presents itself to its
readers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We publish tons of new material every day already,'' said
Scott Rosenberg, Salon's technology editor. However, focus groups
revealed that its readers aren't aware of this.
</P>
<P>
   On the Web, fresh material draws a steady stream of surfers and
clicks, the lifeblood of any site. The redesigned site will launch
March 29, and Rosenberg said many of the details are still being
worked out. ``We'll be making changes up to the last minute,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But fans of treatises, take heart: ``We're not giving up the
in-depth stuff,'' Rosenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Salon has already started some changes. Today marks the debut of
a serial novel about six geeks trying to get ahead. ``Silicon
Follies,'' by Thomas Scoville &UR;  &LR; will be updated every Monday and
Thursday. Salon describes it as a geeky ``Tales of the City.''
</P>
<P>
   Scoville, a 15-year Silicon Valley veteran, writes essays on
digital culture and created ``The Silicon Valley Tarot,'' an online
deck of fortune-telling cards for nerds, such as the Five of
Cubicles and the Ace of Networks.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Salon hired six new writers from such
ink-and-paper stalwarts as The New Yorker, U.S. News and World
Report and Time magazine, who are charged with beefing up expanded
sections on health and books.
</P>
<P>
   Now if only Salon could get rid of its real competition:
 &LR; www.salon-magazine.com &LR;  and  &LR; www.salon.com &LR;  and _ Web sites about
beauty products that, thanks to their similar monikers, lure the
Web literati to discussions of the finer points of manicures and
pedicures.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WEBBIES TONIGHT &LR; : Get out your feather boa. It's Webbies night.
</P>
<P>
   You know the Webbies, the awards ceremony that started from a
San Francisco magazine, the Web, and have survived the mag's demise
to become an institution unto themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Tiffany Shlain, the diva of the Webbies, sees the event as
poking fun at the self-importance of a certain other awards
ceremony taking place in Los Angeles this weekend. She limits
acceptance speeches to five words, and jokes about a red carpet
area for the ``celebrity'' nominees _ the HTML code-slingers behind
sites ranging from www.superbad.com to the Smithsonian magazine's
site.
</P>
<P>
   But some see Shlain's establishment of an International Academy
of Digital Arts and Sciences to nominate Webby contenders as
sliding toward pomposity.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Trying to knock the Webbies off their pedestal, Manish Vij,
CEO of a Mountain View Web graphics firm, NetStudio, last year
launched the ``Mud Brick Awards'' for the world's ugliest Web
sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to be the opposite of the Webbies,'' says Vij.
``They're an elitist ceremony. We're trailer-park, beer-drinking
folks.''
</P>
<P>
   Vij will announce the Mud Brick finalists tomorrow with a beer
bash for the ``winners'' coming later in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   Shlain sees the Muddies as having the difficult task of
parodying a parody: ``We're already poking fun at ourselves,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SMALL PLANET CONFRONTS Y2K: &LR;  Frances Moore Lappe first made a
name for herself in 1972 as a 27-year-old Berkeley prodigy when she
wrote the best-selling ``Diet for a Small Planet.''
</P>
<P>
   Now 55 and living in Brattleboro, Vt., Lappe is planning a
return to the Bay Area next month to hawk her latest effort: News
you can use about the Year 2000 computer problem.
</P>
<P>
   Lappe will be lobbying scribes at a conference for the American
Society of Newspaper Editors, meeting in San Francisco the week of
April 12. She wants to sell subscriptions to her American News
Service, a nonprofit that syndicates ``solutions-based'' articles
by its 40 writers to newspapers and magazines.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  The service is predicated on the notion that people are sick
of reading only about problems and want articles that also propose
solutions. The Y2K glitch is only one area it's focusing on.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really want to widen the news lens,'' Lappe said. ``We
think it's a great hazard for democracy when news is defined as
what's breaking, what's shocking or what's happening in Washington,
D.C. If we see only a small slice of life around us, we get a very
distorted sense of what we can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the service launched a Y2K news bureau, and now more
than 40 stories are posted on its Web site at
 &LR; www.americannews.com &LR; . The stories are available only to
subscribers, who pay $39.95 a year for access to the site.
Newspapers like the Boston Globe and Los Angeles Times also pay for
the right to reprint the stories.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CRAMER STRIKES BACK: &LR;  His salary and stock options were laid
bare in Securities and Exchange Commission filings. His hedge fund
reported results on a lousy year. All this on the heels of
continued criticism of his skirting ethical lines between trading
in stocks and writing about them.
</P>
<P>
   James Cramer, the co-founder and columnist at the online
financial news site TheStreet.com, hasn't been able to answer many
of his critics, as the SEC places a virtual muzzle on any company
about to launch a public stock offering. (TheStreet.com announced a
pending public offering last month.)
</P>
<P>
   But Cramer does churn out the columns, and this week he lashed
back: ``Looks like the dead-tree press is having a field day at my
expense, and will continue to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   In true Cramer fashion, he says, ``I am not taking the bait'' _
and then he bites.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my business, there are two kinds of people, those who make
money and those who critique those who make money. I am proud to be
in the former, and I will not let the latter stop me.''
</P>

   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
A U.S. senator on Tuesday introduced legislation that would crack
down on weapons sales on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet Gun Trafficking Act, sponsored by Senator Charles
Schumer, D-N.Y., would make it illegal for anyone who is not a
licensed gun dealer to advertise or sell firearms on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, federal law allows unlicensed dealers to sell guns
over the Internet. However, if the buyer and seller are in
different states, the gun must first be shipped to a licensed gun
dealer, who performs the background check and releases the gun to
the buyer.
</P>
<P>
   California has its own laws governing sales of guns within the
state.
</P>
<P>
   The new bill also would require Web sites that advertise or sell
guns to register with the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our laws to keep felons from buying guns are based on a
face-to-face sale using proper ID and a criminal background
check,'' said Schumer. ``The Internet is a gaping loophole that has
the potential of arming those who no one in their right mind would
trust with a gun.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumer said he found thousands of guns for sale _ from cheap
pistols to automatic assault-style weapons _ on dozens of
unregulated, unlicensed Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``The firepower which can be acquired simply going online is
chilling,'' he said in a press release. ``Ensuring the fitness of a
person to own a gun must go farther than requiring only a computer
and an e-mail address.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the National Rifle Association called the bill
unnecessary, saying that federal laws already apply to Internet
purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer isn't the only lawmaker concerned about unregulated gun
sales. U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., is drafting
legislation that would require unlicensed gun dealers selling
across state lines to perform background checks on the buyer.
Currently, only licensed dealers must perform the criminal
background check, as required by the Brady Bill, according to
Feinstein's office.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, modeled on California law, would apply to guns sold
over the Internet, at gun shows, through classified ads and in
other person-to-person transactions, a Feinstein spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Online auction giant eBay recently banned sales of guns and
ammunition on its site. The San Jose company said firearms sales
had been an area of growing concern because online sellers cannot
readily guarantee that buyers meet all the qualifications and
comply with the laws governing firearms sales.

 Column: How to Get Alert for New E-Mail
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By David Einstein &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Question: &LR;  Are you aware of any software that will provide an alert
on the desktop when new e-mail arrives? I would like this to work
if my modem cord is plugged into the wall telephone socket, but I
am not online.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Answer: &LR;  If you're not online, how is your computer going to
know if you have new mail? Sorry, but to get mail, or even to be
alerted that you have it, you must be connected to your e-mail
server, and that means you must be online.
</P>
<P>
   That said, a number of programs are available that can
automatically log onto the Internet at scheduled times, check your
mailboxes and provide visual or audio alerts about new messages.
Among the most popular are MailAlert, a $15 shareware program from
Diamond Ridge; E-Mail Notify, $20 shareware from Cyber-Info; and
AvirMail, a freebie from Avir. All can be downloaded from the ZDNet
software library at  &LR; www.hotfiles.com. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   It bears mentioning that America Online also has a sophisticated
mail-alert feature that beeps when new mail arrives while you're
online and lets you schedule ``Flash Sessions'' to check mail
periodically when you're away from your computer.
</P>
<P>
   Maximizing Your Modem
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have an LT Win Modem that came with my Hewlett-Packard
Pavilion PC in July of 1997. It's a K56Flex modem, but the highest
speed I could get on AOL's 56K lines in Walnut Creek was 31.2. I
went to Lucent Technologies' Web site (they made the modem) and
downloaded and installed the software for upgrading to the new V.90
standard. But now, my top speed is just 28.8. I have written to
Lucent twice and have gotten no response. AOL says go to the PC
manufacturer, HP says go to the modem-maker and CompUSA, from whom
I bought the system along with a 3-year warranty, says they're
stumped.
</P>
<P>
   A: Before you start casting blame, you should determine whether
your telephone line can handle 56K speeds. 3Com, a big modem-maker,
offers an online feature that lets you do that. Go to 3Com's site
 &LR; (www.3com.com)  &LR; and search for ``linetest.''
</P>
<P>
   If your line is OK, I'd recommend going to HP's site and
downloading the upgrade software from there. The program available
from HP supposedly is designed specifically for your modem, while
Lucent's upgrade software is a generic version.
</P>
<P>
   To locate the program on HP's site  &LR; (www.hp.com), &LR;  go to
Services &AMP; Support, then to Personal Computers, then find your
model.
</P>
<P>
   Cheaper Chips
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am thinking about buying a new computer and I was wondering
if the Intel Celeron and AMD K6 chips are really good deals. Are
there any problems running software written for Pentium chips? And
are they more prone to crashing and glitches? I mostly use
Microsoft Word and am most interested in how Word performs on these
cheaper chips. I am graduating from law school soon and then going
into government service, so cost is a great factor to me.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: A PC that uses either the Celeron or the K6 should
perform just fine for you. Both are fully compatible with Windows
and all Windows software. The Celeron is slower than the Pentium
II, but the K6 isn't. In fact, systems boasting AMD's latest K6
chips are real bargains these days.
</P>
<P>
   Help With RealPlayer
</P>
<P>
   Q: I recently changed Internet service providers from America
Online to the Microsoft Network. I now find that I can no longer
use my RealPlayer with MSN. The program refuses to open. MSN's
less-than-helpful technical support blew me off by claiming that
this did not fall within their support boundaries. RealNetworks'
solution involves altering the registry, a procedure a neophyte
like myself is not comfortable with. Any suggestions?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: A suspicious person might think that the Microsoft
software was designed to disable the RealPlayer, which competes
against Microsoft's Windows Media Player. But RealNetworks' people
say their technical wizards are unaware of anything in MSN that
could have caused your RealPlayer to stop working. They said it
might be ``an anomaly.''
</P>
<P>
   I know that doesn't help much. Best advice I can offer is to
uninstall both MSN and the RealPlayer, then reinstall them in that
order.
</P>
<P>
   Copy Your Contacts
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm running Windows 98 and using Outlook Express 5 for my
e-mail. Is there a way to back up my address book so I can keep a
safe copy of all contacts on a floppy?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: There are a couple of ways to go on this. You can simply
copy the actual address book file, which contains all your
contacts. Open Windows Explorer, then locate the file, which is
located in Windows/Application Data/Microsoft/Address Book. You'll
recognize the file because it starts with your e-mail ID and ends
with .wab. Insert a floppy disk and drag the address book file to
the floppy.
</P>
<P>
   Another option is to save the address book as a text file that
can be opened in a word processor, spreadsheet or database. To do
this, go to the address book's File menu and choose Export, then
Other Address Book. In the Export Tool window that appears, choose
Text File, then click the Export button and follow the
instructions.

RENAULT OFFER TO NISSAN IS QUESTIONED
</HEADLINE>

 By   KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Having failed in previous international mergers in the
United States and elsewhere, Renault &UR;  &LR; SA is encountering
considerable skepticism in financial markets following the French
automaker's offer for a large stake in heavily indebted Nissan
Motor &UR;  &LR; Co. of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Credit rating agencies said Wednesday that they were reviewing
Renault's finances, the company's stock fell sharply and investors
questioned whether the proposal Renault announced on Tuesday would
solve either company's problems.
</P>
<P>
   While Mack Trucks has done fairly well since Renault bought it
nearly a decade ago, a planned merger with AB Volvo &UR;  &LR; fell apart in
1993 after Swedish managers complained that their French colleagues
were pushing them around.
</P>
<P>
   Renault's most notable failure in an auto marriage came when it
took control of American Motors Corp. in several stages in the
early 1980s. Cultural differences produced managerial chaos.
</P>
<P>
   Then Renault sold the company to Chrysler &UR;  &LR; Corp. in 1987, just a
few years before the sport utility vehicle boom made American
Motors' Jeep brand one of the most valuable businesses in the auto
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Meyers, a chairman and chief executive of American Motors
who quit in 1982 after clashing with Renault, predicted Wednesday
that Renault and Nissan would not be able to work together. ``I
can't think of any two cultures that are in more conflicts than
these _ they're both not interested in somebody else's ideas,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the question of what Renault sees in Nissan that
other automakers have already dismissed as unworthy of their time.
DaimlerChrysler &UR;  &LR; quit talks with Nissan a week ago. The Ford
Motor &UR;  &LR; Co. held talks with Nissan about taking a stake earlier this
year, but the two sides never even reached the point of exchanging
detailed financial information, said auto executives who insisted
on anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's leeriness of Nissan reflects the American automaker's
suspicion of Japanese automaker finances in general. Ford bought 25
percent of Mazda &UR;  &LR; in 1979, but only after increasing its stake to
33.4 percent in 1996, and installing some of its own executives to
help run Mazda, did Ford discover that Mazda's dealerships had
incurred enormous debts for which Mazda was liable, the auto
executives said.
</P>
<P>
   Renault's stock fell 6.2 percent in trading in Paris Wednesday,
following its announcement late Tuesday that it would seek to buy
35 percent of Nissan, and reportedly offering $5.3 billion for it.
Renault's shares have tumbled 28 percent since it confirmed on Jan.
18 that it wanted to invest in Nissan.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One of the main concerns among credit rating agencies in their
review of Renault is the debt load of Nissan. Scott Sprinzen, the
managing director for auto ratings at Standard &AMP; Poor's, said that
the ratings agency had concerns about ``the extent to which Renault
could benefit from an investment in such a financially weak
company, and whether the two companies working together could
effect an operational turnaround at Nissan.''
</P>
<P>
   Estimates of Nissan's debt start at $20 billion but run much
higher because no one outside the company knows its full liability
for borrowing by various Nissan affiliates. Nissan's shares also
fell 1.7 percent in Tokyo Wednesday as investors fretted over how
long it will take the company to find a partner.
</P>
<P>
   Another issue for auto industry experts Wednesday lay in
Renault's willingness to take a stake in Nissan without divulging
any plan for combining activities and cutting costs. To increase
their profits significantly, the two companies must combine vehicle
development programs, auto parts purchasing and their distribution
of cars and other vehicles, said John A. Casesa, an auto analyst at
Schroder &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``To take advantage of 4 million units of volume, the two
companies really have to become one,'' Casesa said. ``That'll mean
head count reductions, a lot of management reshuffling.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Nissan and Renault are each approaching the deal as a way to
avoid cutbacks while retaining separate management structures. The
French government owns 44.2 percent of Renault, and the French
transport minister, Jean-Claude Gayssot, portrayed the potential
business combination Wednesday as a way to avoid reductions in
staffing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no concerns about decisions over merging or
restructuring,'' he said. ``My concern is that the potential to
develop our businesses and our activities should translate into a
strengthening of those activities and in the defense and promotion
of employment.''
</P>
<P>
   Acquiring a large stake in Nissan would make Renault less
reliant on the French market. Renault is only now developing sport
utility vehicles and luxury sedans, the two market segments in
which other global automakers are making most of their profits, and
could tap Nissan's experience in both classes of vehicles. Nissan
also has more factories than it needs, and some of this extra
capacity could be used to sell Nissan cars through Renault's
extensive distribution network in France and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The most profitable auto market in the world now is in the
United States, because of the strong economy. But Renault only
sells Mack trucks here, and it's unclear to what extent Nissan's
American operations will help Renault.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan lost nearly $700 million here last year as it relied too
heavily on discounts and offered small, fuel efficient vehicles
that did not sell well because of cheap gasoline prices.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan's American operations plan to introduce six new or
redesigned models later this year and have already reduced
inventories and limited discounts, which should make the operations
break even this year, said Jason Vines, a company spokesman. But
Casesa said that while Nissan's coming cars were better designed,
stiff competition would make a quick financial improvement
difficult.

KOSOVO TALKS NEAR END AS SERBS BUILD UP
</HEADLINE>

   PARIS _ As the Serbs continued to pour troops and tanks into
Kosovo, European and American intermediaries in peace talks here
prepared Wednesday to shut down the negotiations without any
agreement, probably on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   American officials in Washington and French Foreign Ministry
officials here warned that the NATO allies were ready to carry out
their threat of a vast bombing campaign against Serbian military
targets in Kosovo and beyond unless the Yugoslav president,
Slobodan Milosevic, accepted an accord.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Wesley Clark, the alliance's supreme commander, testified
before the House Armed Services Committee on Wednesday that Serbian
forces were ``prepared to resume the conflict on a very large scale
should these peace talks fail to result in an agreement or should
they conclude that for some reason NATO wasn't serious in its
expressed intent.''
</P>
<P>
   French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine, co-chairman of the peace
talks here with British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, said on
Tuesday that NATO's decision to use force if the Serbs were the
main obstacle to peace remained in effect. French diplomats said
Wednesday that France and the United States stood firmly with the
rest of the allies in their determination to carry out the threat.
</P>
<P>
   Before the talks break off, the ethnic Albanians who have been
fighting for the last year for independence for the province will
sign the draft agreement that was worked out at Rambouillet outside
Paris last month, according to mediators and representatives of the
Albanian delegation.
</P>
<P>
   ``One signature, unfortunately, doesn't make an agreement,''
said the Russian mediator, Boris Mayorsky. The draft provides for
autonomy for Kosovo under Serbian sovereignty for a three-year
transition period, and 28,000 peacekeepers under NATO command to
enforce its terms.
</P>
<P>
   But mediators said Wednesday that Serbian negotiators were
refusing even to discuss terms of how to put the agreement into
effect. ``Based on talks the last few days with the Yugoslav side,
we are not anticipating any further progress,'' said Christopher R.
Hill, a mediator and the U.S. ambassador to Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   Vedrine and Cook will confer with the mediators on Thursday
afternoon about ending the talks, officials said, and could decide
to make one more trip to Belgrade to try to get Milosevic to change
his mind and accept the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   But diplomats said that it might take the bombing that NATO has
been threatening since last fall to get the Serbian side to change
its position and sign a peace settlement with the ethnic Albanians
who make up 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million people.
</P>
<P>
   An adviser to the ethnic Albanians said that most members of the
delegation were anxious to get back to Kosovo as soon as possible,
in view of reports that Milosevic has moved 30,000 to 40,000 troops
into or close to Kosovo, defying an agreement he made last October
to pull out most of his military and police forces.
</P>
<P>
   James Rubin, the State Department spokesman, who arrived here
Wednesday, said Secretary of State Madeleine Albright had invited
the Kosovo Albanian leaders to come to Washington after they signed
the agreement and the talks ended. Ms. Albright got the Albanian
delegation to accept the accord in principle when the first phase
of negotiations in Rambouillet ended on Feb. 23, but they asked for
time to consult with local military commanders in Kosovo before
actually agreeing to sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Serbs continue to have problems with the political part of
the agreement and are not prepared to discuss issues of
implementation,'' said Wolfgang Petritsch, the European Union
mediator in the talks, at the end of the third day of sessions
Wednesday. The United States, Britain, France, Germany and Italy,
co-sponsors of the talks with Russia, say that the 28,000 NATO
peacekeepers are an indispensable part of the 81-page draft accord.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   If the Serbs remain opposed, or intensify the fighting in Kosovo
significantly in coming days, and the allies decided to bomb, they
probably would not be ready to take action for at least a week,
according to officials in Brussels. The 400 American and British
warplanes would not begin striking until after diplomats had been
evacuated from Belgrade, the capital of Serbia and what remains of
Yugoslavia, and 2,000 cease-fire observers had been pulled out of
Kosovo, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   After that, probably next week, NATO Secretary General Javier
Solana could order attacks against selected Serbian military
targets by American cruise missiles launched from Navy ships
standing off the Balkan coast in the Adriatic.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on Milosevic's response to those strikes, Solana could
then order a phased bombing campaign with the aim of destroying
most of Serbia's ability to shoot down allied warplanes with
ground-to-air artillery and rockets.
</P>
<P>
   Allied diplomats said they hoped that the threat of further
destruction would be enough to get Milosevic to accept the accord.
Under the agreement, peacekeepers would deploy throughout the
province to oversee the disbanding of the Kosovo Liberation Army
guerrillas; make sure Serbian police and military forces now
attacking civilian areas withdraw to selected areas, leaving the
province altogether within a year; and provide security while the
Albanians take responsibility for their own affairs.

IN RUSSIA, SCANDAL AND INTRIGUE EMBOLDEN A YELTSIN FOE 
</HEADLINE>
  (wg) 
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Six weeks ago, Russia's top prosecutor, Yuri Skuratov,
handed in his resignation and disappeared from sight, causing a
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   As that scandal took on new and ominous dimensions on Wednesday,
Skuratov returned to view, twice. The first time was in the upper
house of parliament, where he suddenly announced that he planned to
stay in his job, in open defiance of President Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   The second time was on a midnight television news program on a
government channel, where for a few minutes Skuratov, 46, appeared
as the star of a black-and-white videotape, naked and in bed with
two young women, also naked and neither his wife.
</P>
<P>
   The first scene rocked the uneasy political truce here, setting
the stage for another showdown between Yeltsin and his opposition,
which seems to be gathering strength daily. The second _ clearly
aimed at discrediting the Yeltsin opposition's latest hero _ sets a
new low for Russian politics, which long ago lost all ideological
luster and is now sinking deep into a mudbath.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two conclusions you can draw from this affair,''
said Pavel Voshchanov, a radio commentator and former press
secretary to Yeltsin. ``The first is that there are no politics in
Russia, only political intrigues. And the second is that everyone
has compromising material on everyone else, and usually, it is
true.''
</P>
<P>
   Appearing before the council on Wednesday, Skuratov said that
before his resignation six weeks ago, he had been the target of a
blackmail attempt that he traced to political and financial figures
who, he said, fearing ongoing inquiries by the prosecutor's office,
had driven a wedge between him and Yeltsin. He did not say whom he
had in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could almost feel that the activity of law-enforcement
agencies stuck in their throat like a bone, that we had stepped on
their sore spots, especially when it came to illegal privatization
and reorganization of enterprises into joint stock companies,
illegal banking activities, economic management, abuses by top
level officials,'' he told the council members.
</P>
<P>
   He vowed to press ahead with a series of potentially sensational
investigations _ into financial misdeeds at the Central Bank of
Russia, into illegal trading in government securities during last
summer's financial crisis, and into the blackmail attempt itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The information they obtained was obtained in violation of the
law, egregious violation of the law,'' Skuratov said, referring to
the video, adding that ``the way it has been used can also be
punishable.''
</P>
<P>
   As the day's remarkable events unfolded, it became clear that
this scandal _ unlike so many others in Russia _ could actually
have lasting consequences, above all for Yeltsin, who apparently
was caught off guard by Skuratov's abrupt about-face.
</P>
<P>
   The most serious political challenge for the ailing president
came from the normally loyal Federation Council, made up of
regional governors and administrators, which voted overwhelmingly
to back Skuratov, by 142-6, with 3 abstentions.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday evening, Yeltsin signaled that he would fight back,
saying through a spokesman that he would resubmit Skuratov's
resignation to the council, which under the constitution has the
sole authority to hire and fire Russia's top prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Kremlin spokesman Dmitri Yakushkin said Yeltsin _ who is in a
Moscow hospital recovering from a bleeding ulcer _ was ``very
uneasy about the unhealthy situation'' created by Skuratov's
decision.
</P>
<P>
   After summoning Prime Minister Yevgeni Primakov for an
unscheduled meeting earlier on Wednesday, Yeltsin and Primakov
issued a joint statement that pointedly praised the Federation
Council for its campaign against corruption, but challenged
Skuratov's moral authority to lead it.
</P>
<P>
   ``While fully supporting the efforts of the upper house of
parliament to combat crime and corruption, the president and prime
minister agreed that unscrupulousness and politicking are
incompatible with the high post of prosecutor general,'' Yeltsin's
press service said. ``Senators also realize that only morally
untainted persons can combat crime.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin's last word came during the late-night news program
when it aired the video. According to news reports that broke last
month, the video was taped more than a year ago in an apartment in
central Moscow belonging to a top employee of the prosecutor's
office with ties to shady bankers.
</P>
<P>
   Before airing the tape Wednesday night, the anchor advised that
the material _ which had already been shown on a television station
in Georgia _ was not suitable for viewers under 18 years old.
</P>
<P>
   If the video was meant to freeze Skuratov out of public life, it
failed, at least for now. ``When everyone is watched, their
pictures taken, watched through a key hole, taped etc, this is
disgusting to use such dirty, illegal methods,'' said Gov.
Amangeldy Tueleyv of Kemerovo.
</P>
<P>
   But there were also signs that the Federation Council was
already prepared to do battle with the Yeltsin government on other
issues. At its Wednesday session, the upper house of parliament
voted to lower Russia's value-added tax, rejecting pleas by the
government to delay the reduction, and to create a council that
would review television programs for their ``moral'' content _ a
measure seen by the Russian media as a first step on the road to
censorship.
</P>
<P>
   The news of the upper house's rebellion was greeted with
applause by the communist party-dominated opposition in the lower
house. Other deputies detected the telltale signs of a worsening
confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   ``These developments are a sign of an approaching serious
political crisis because this decision is aimed, in essence,
against the president,'' said Sergei Ivanenko, a leader of the
liberal Yabloko faction, commenting on the Federation Council's
vote for Skuratov.
</P>
<P>
   Political observers were mostly struck by the audacity of
Skuratov's surprise announcement, which ended six weeks of studied
silence. His original resignation, made on Feb. 1, was never fully
explained: no one believed the official explanation that he was
quitting for health reasons.
</P>
<P>
   In his statement Wednesday to the Federation council, Skuratov
said that his resignation had been engineered by forces that were
worried about his office's investigations into ``dubious
operations'' in government securities. He named no names, but
sprinkled his text with tantalizing tips about parliamentary
deputies, ``two former vice prime ministers, former and incumbent
ministers and their deputies, some of the Central Bank's
high-ranking officials.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can be sure that they did their best to create an
intolerable climate for the prosecutor general's office and me as
its head,'' he said. ``They have made sure that the president gets
the right word about me.''
</P>
<P>
   Skuratov did not name Boris Berezovsky, a tycoon whose
businesses are already under investigation, but by ticking off a
list of well-known Berezovsky-linked companies, he clearly meant to
imply that Berezovsky was behind the campaign to blackmail him.
``It became known during the investigation that they knew about my
coming resignation at least a month in advance,'' Skuratov said.
</P>
<P>
   As several observers noted, Skuratov is now in good position to
take revenge. ``We're facing a new political phenomenon in
Russia,'' noted Vladimir Ryzhkov, parliamentary leader of Our Home
is Russia, a centrist party, ``when the prosecutor general's
office, having received a vote of confidence at the Federation
Council, is becoming an absolutely politically independent organ
from the main branches of power, including the Federation Council
itself.''

AMERICA WEST FLIGHT ATTEND ANTS BUOYED BY SALARY OFFER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER CORBETT  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As final contract negotiations began Wednesday,
America West Airlines flight attendants were buoyed by a salary
proposal from the airline that could bring their pay scale to
within 90 percent of Southwest Airline's.
</P>
<P>
   ``That may form the basis of a settlement,'' Bill McGlashen,
president of the Association of Flight Attendants Council 66, said
outside the offices of the National Mediation Board just before the
start of talks.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest's wage scale ranges from $15,500 to $44,000 per year,
according to the AFA. America West's current scale ranges from
about $12,000 to $22,000 per year.
</P>
<P>
   America West Chairman William Franke disclosed the offer in a
letter Feb. 12 to each flight attendant.
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, the union presented its latest offer, which
includes new provisions on salary and sick leave.
</P>
<P>
   The AFA's sick-leave proposal presented Wednesday clarifies a
policy that had previously been agreed to in general terms,
McGlashen said. No details were available about the salary
provisions.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Johnson, senior vice president for corporate affairs,
said America West had not seen the AFA's offer and would not
comment on the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Franke's letter to the flight attendants outlines the company's
$68.7 million proposal, which is $15.2 million above a tentative
agreement that flight attendants rejected in December 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The union's latest offer is valued at $85.3 million, according
to McGlashen.
</P>
<P>
   The company is offering starting pay of $16.13 per hour, up to
$34.59 after 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   The AFA is willing to accept starting pay of just over $15 per
hour, but wants the top pay increased to nearly $40 per hour. About
75 percent of the flight attendants are at the top of the pay
scale.
</P>
<P>
   America West, the ninth-largest carrier, says it cannot meet the
flight attendants' wage demands because its revenues are only 78
percent of the average revenue of the combined major carriers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our other work groups, both union and non-union, as well as
our management employees, are paid on a basis consistent with our
revenues,'' said Anthony Mule, vice president of inflight services,
in a March 10 letter to flight attendants.
</P>
<P>
   Another issue is travel expenses or per diem for the flight
attendants. Union members want $1.80 per hour for overnight trips,
while the company is offering $1.30 initially. That would increase
to $1.50 after 30 months and to $1.75 at the end of the five-year
contract.
</P>
<P>
   America West's proposal would increase total compensation _
salary and travel expenses _ on average 20.8 percent or $5,434 the
first year and 44.7 percent or $11,438 in the fifth year of the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The company and union negotiators went to Washington in good
faith to make a deal, according to Johnson, adding that he is
hopeful there will be an agreement by late Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators for Tempe-based America West and the AFA have less
48 than hours to resolve their dispute over an initial contract for
the flight attendants, who organized in 1994. Talks on the latest
contract began last spring.
</P>
<P>
   A strike deadline of 10:01 p.m. Friday (Arizona time) is hanging
over negotiators, with both sides saying they hope to head off a
shutdown.
</P>
<P>
   If a settlement is not reached, AFA will consider filing a
complaint against America West management for illegal ``direct
dealing'' with the flight attendants through letters and possible
conversations with Negotiating Committee members outside of
negotiations, the AFA said in a statement, adding that the company
is bound by law to deal with the flight attendants' representative,
which is AFA.
</P>
<P>
   McGlashen said the AFA is prepared to strike if there's no deal.
</P>
<P>
   A strike tactic called CHAOS _ Create Havoc Around Our System _
will target selected flights at the last minute to disrupt the
airline.
</P>
<P>
   America West says it might shut down entirely if CHAOS causes
too much disruption.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves travelers wondering whether they will be stranded
and other America West workers worried that they will be forced to
go without a paycheck if the carrier follows through on its threat
to close.
</P>
<P>
   Short of an agreement, a very busy spring travel season in
Arizona will be crippled by a work stoppage.
</P>
<P>
   America West carries about 40 percent of the travelers using Sky
Harbor International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Union members are not concerned that they will alienate America
West passengers if there is a strike, McGlashen said, adding that
travelers have been supportive of the flight attendants.
</P>
<P>
   Talks are expected to continue today and Friday at the National
Mediation Board offices in Washington. &QL;

 Sega Talks a Good Game at Conference
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Benny Evangelista &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Sega of America is dreaming big about selling consumers its new
Dreamcast gaming console later this year, but still has a way to go
to convince skeptical game developers to create titles for it.
</P>
<P>
   Attendees at the 13th Annual Game Developers Conference in San
Jose yesterday gave Sega of America President Bernard Stolar only
lukewarm applause when he flexed some of Dreamcast's advanced video
game muscles.
</P>
<P>
   Game developers say they aren't convinced Sega can beat market
leaders Sony and Nintendo. Current game devices cost about $130 and
connect to a TV for display; next-generation devices are expected
to be more than $200.
</P>
<P>
   Some developers said they were delaying plans for Dreamcast
games to learn more about market leader Sony Corp.'s competing
PlayStation II.
</P>
<P>
   Sega's Dreamcast, which features better graphics and Internet
connectivity, is due out in the United States this fall, giving it
a full year's head start on the new Sony machine, which is coming
in fall 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But Sony, with 50 million users worldwide _ 17 million of them
in the United States _ for its current PlayStation, has a huge,
fanatical market primed for its new machine.
</P>
<P>
   The No. 2 player, Nintendo 64, has sold almost 20 million units
worldwide, 11 million of them in the United States. Sega's two
previous consoles, the Saturn and Genesis, never achieved that kind
of popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Lane Kiriyama, chief financial officer of Saffire Corp., a game
developer in Utah, said Sony's announcement of a PlayStation II has
stopped his firm's Dreamcast development projects ``in their
tracks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now (game publishers) are saying `Put it on hold, we want to
do the PlayStation,''' Kiriyama said.
</P>
<P>
   Another game company executive said game-makers are reluctant to
commit to Sega because of the current PlayStation's dominance in
the market, the greater marketing muscle of both Sony and Nintendo,
and Sega's past failures with two other platforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``With game development costs as high as they are, if you're a
game developer, are you going to bet on the guy who's coming from
the back or the guy who's got the front seat right now?'' said the
executive, who did not want to be identified because his firm works
with all three console makers.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said this year's conference is particularly important
to both Sony and Sega because game developers are starting to make
decisions about games that won't appear on store shelves for 18
months or more.
</P>
<P>
   Sega does have some big-name players that have pledged support
for Dreamcast, including Acclaim, Accolade, Capcom, GT Interactive,
Hasbro Interactive and Midway.
</P>
<P>
   And Stoler said during his keynote speech that about 100
companies worldwide are working on Dreamcast games. Titles like
Mortal Kombat 5, Ready to Rumble and PowerStone will be available
when Dreamcast, already on sale in Japan, makes its U.S. debut.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sega is going to take back market share from Sony and Nintendo
with Dreamcast,'' Stoler said. ``Dreamcast is a platform that will
change more than a few minds. Like they say in the movies, `Hold on
folks, you ain't seen nothing yet.' We're dreaming big and we're
delivering big.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Hindorf, vice president of product development for Midway's
Atari Games division in Milpitas, which is creating Mortal Kombat
5, said he is impressed by what he has seen so far of the Dreamcast
and Sega's plans for better technical support for game developers
than it offered in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Sega may have an advantage because its new platform is already
on sale in Japan, while Sony's is still only in the pipeline, but
``the smart publishers are going to place bets on as many machines
as possible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   No. 2 Nintendo also plans a competing next-generation console
dubbed the Nintendo 2000, but is content to let Sega and Sony slug
it out first.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a company that focuses on the present,'' said Perrin
Kaplan, corporate affairs director for Nintendo of America Inc.
Thanks to sales of hits like The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time,
the Nintendo 64 has sold nearly 11 million units in the U.S. since
its launch in September 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Nintendo plans to spend $250 million on marketing the N64 this
year, more than double the $100 million Sega has budgeted to pitch
the Dreamcast. Sony's marketing expenses were not available.
</P>
<P>
   Nintendo has done well in handheld devices, selling more than 2
million units of the new color version of its 10-year-old Game Boy
in less than a year. &UR;  &LR; Kaplan said Nintendo in May will start
selling new Game Boy Colors in six colorful cases _ teal,
tangerine, berry, kiwi, grape and transparent grape.
</P>
<P>
   Sony officials have maintained a low-key profile so far at the
conference, but Sony Computer Entertainment of America Vice
President Phil Harrison is expected to reveal more details of the
new PlayStation II during a keynote speech this morning.

 &HT;    Motorola adds concierge, child care to entice workers
 &HT;    By Lori Hawkins
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ It's about to get a lot easier for Motorola Inc.
workers to cross items off their to-do lists.
</P>
<P>
   The company, for its part, hopes a new program called Etc. will
help it keep workers and attract new ones in Austin's tight job
market.
</P>
<P>
   Etc. is designed to handle the time-consuming errands that eat
up lunch hour and stress out folks trying to balance work and
family. Motorola is Austin's second-biggest (behind Dell Computer
Corp.) private sector employer with 10,000 workers in its local
semiconductor operations.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall, Motorola will open child development centers at its
Ed Bluestein and Oak Hill campuses that will care for 400 children
from 6 weeks to 6 years old at what the company says will be a
``competitive cost.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting in July, a concierge service will charge $5 an hour to
walk dogs, run errands, grocery shop and mail packages, and handle
car service, dry cleaning and gift buying.
</P>
<P>
   And it is adding activity centers with offerings including
exercise equipment, personal trainers, kick boxing and yoga
classes, and massages. Monthly memberships for employees and
spouses will cost $20 a month.
</P>
<P>
   The company is pumping up its perks because of the intense
competition for workers in Austin, where the jobless rate was 2.7
percent in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``Austin's unemployment rate is so low that it takes a heck of
lot more than a paycheck to lure employees,'' says Sandi Aitken,
manager of Premiere Services at Motorola Austin. ``People here have
an opportunity to choose from a variety of employers, and in
addition to compensation and leading edge technology, employees
value perks.''
</P>
<P>
   Motorola's program is an example of how chronic labor shortages
in fields such as computers and finance are forcing companies to
get creative with benefits. Many are offering CEO-style perks to
rank and file employees in an effort to attract and keep talent.
</P>
<P>
   Other Austin companies are also competing with perks. First USA,
which has more than 1,200 employees in Austin, has a fitness
center, a basketball court, a sand volleyball pit and a jogging
trail. Plans are in the works to add a concierge desk this year.
</P>
<P>
   Etc. will be offered in Austin and in Phoenix, where Motorola
also has extensive chip operations.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which is still struggling for profitability in its
chip business, is subsidizing the offerings, but declines to
disclose how much it is investing on concierge services or on the
new fitness and child-care centers.
</P>
<P>
   The child-care centers, scheduled to open in the fall, will be
operated by Bright Horizons Family Solutions, a corporate
child-care provider with offices in Boston and Nashville. The
centers will have slots for children from families who don't work
at Motorola.
</P>
<P>
   The Oak Hill center will be 15,000 square feet and will take 225
children: 175 from Motorola and 50 from the community. The Ed
Bluestein site will be 11,000 square feet and will care for 175
children, 125 of them from Motorola.
</P>
<P>
   Etc. is the result of 18 months of brainstorming by a group of
senior level employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we were aiming for is peace of mind with what's going on
with your family, and having more time to focus on the things that
are meaningful to you,'' Aitken says. ``We think we succeeded.''

TRAIN CRASH INQUIRY FOCUSES ON TIRE TRACKS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Miss., La.)  (See also TRAIN-VICTIMS) 
(mk) 
 By PAM BELLUCK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Federal safety investigators on Wednesday began trying
to identify the source of a set of tire tracks inside the crossing
gate at the site of a deadly crash between an Amtrak train and a
semi-trailer truck Monday night in Bourbonnais, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   The tracks ``would indicate somebody tried to go around the
gates,'' said John Goglia, a member of the National Transportation
Safety Board. Investigators were trying to determine whether the
tracks matched those of the truck, which would suggest that the
truck driver had tried to cross the tracks after being warned that
the train was coming.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, at the exact time the crash occurred,
investigators were using another locomotive and truck in the
positions of the vehicles to determine when and if the truck driver
could have seen the oncoming train.
</P>
<P>
   As the investigation continued, forensic pathologists were
trying to determine how many people had died, and who they were.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were all mangled and burned,'' said Bill Cotter, a deputy
coroner with the Kankakee County coroner's office. ``They are so
badly damaged there is no way we can visually identify the bodies
that we do have.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, National Transportation Safety Board officials
said that 13 people were dead and that three or four others were
missing. On Wednesday they said the number of dead had been lowered
to 11. Based on updated Amtrak figures that indicated only 11
people on the train were unaccounted for, the officials said they
believed there were no others missing. Amtrak officials said they
originally thought that 13 people were unaccounted for but
discovered that two of those people had walked away from the crash.
</P>
<P>
   But officials from the coroner's office said they still did not
know how many people died and they criticized the safety board for
releasing any figures. Cotter said he believed the confusion might
have arisen because the coroner's office had 13 body bags, although
it was not clear that that meant there were 13 bodies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have body bags, but some of the body bags may contain body
parts,'' Cotter said. ``And they may contain other body parts from
the people who survived the wreck.''
</P>
<P>
   A federal team of 20 forensic pathologists, forensic dentists
and FBI fingerprint experts drove in from Washington Wednesday with
a van packed with equipment and began working in a makeshift morgue
in an abandoned lumber company.
</P>
<P>
   They were gathering dental and medical records from families of
the missing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since most of the people are out of this area, this is going
to take some time,'' Cotter said. ``We've got dental records coming
from Mississippi and all over the United States, and Japan, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those presumed dead, according to relatives, were three
young girls and the grandmother of one of the girls, who were
returning home to Nesbit, Miss., after a trip to Chicago to see the
aquarium and shop at the American Girl doll store. They were
traveling with two children and two adults, some of whom were
injured. One of the relatives, Max Bonnin, who believes his wife
and granddaughter are among the dead, said Wednesday that the
confusion about the number of victims has been frustrating.
</P>
<P>
   Cotter said each family was assigned a representative from the
coroner's office and a local minister to help them through the
ordeal of waiting. He said the coroner, James Orrison, has been
meeting with the families twice a day.
</P>
<P>
   The train, the City of New Orleans, left Chicago shortly after 8
p.m. Monday bound for New Orleans. Traveling 79 mph, it struck the
truck, which was packed full of heavy steel bars from a nearby
steel plant, at a railroad crossing in Bourbonnais, a rural
community about 55 miles south of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The crash crumpled the train's two locomotives and the first
three of its 14 cars, smashing them together like an accordion. One
car flipped on its side and another, a double-decker sleeper car,
crashed into a locomotive, split in half and caught fire, burning
the passengers inside. Officials said Wednesday that all of the
dead were in the sleeper car.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 216 passengers and crew on board, 116 were injured, 49 of
them hospitalized.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The truck was heading east across the tracks and was driven by
John Stokes, 58, of Manteno, Ill., who was using a probationary
permit after his license had been suspended because of speeding
tickets. Stokes, who could not be reached for comment, was treated
and released.
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators said the gates, signal lights and bells at
the crossing were all functioning properly and started warning of
the oncoming train 27 seconds before it reached the crossing. They
said the train was blowing its whistle and had slammed on the
emergency brake.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators were planning to re-interview the truck driver,
who said he did not see the train or the warning lights until he
had started driving across the tracks and that the gates closed
before he could get out of the path of the train.
</P>
<P>
   They also wanted to re-interview the engineer, who was
hospitalized after the accident, and on medication that officials
said impaired him from giving a thorough account. In early
interviews, the engineer reportedly told investigators that he saw
the truck try to get around the gates as they were closing.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Illinois Central Railroad, which operates the
crossing, said it would not have been possible for the truck to
start crossing the tracks before the gates began to close and then
become trapped by the gates, because the gates would have hit the
truck and broken.
</P>
<P>
   Goglia said Wednesday that the truck driver tested below the
legal limit on a Breathalyzer test. He said the results of a urine
and blood test were not yet available. The truck was not carrying
more than the legal weight limit of steel.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Highway Administration and the Illinois state police
began an audit Wednesday of the training, staffing and
safety-compliance records of the company Stokes was driving for,
Melco Transfer of Peotone, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Officials reopened the track Wednesday, allowing trains to
proceed at no more than 10 mph, for now.
</P>
<P>
   And they bused some of the relatives of the victims into the
accident site, where, amid the twisted metal, they created a
makeshift memorial: a pyramid of hay bales, potted flower
arrangements, roses and a wreath.

 &HT;    Holyfield regrets his prediction
 &HT;    By Jeff Schult
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Evander Holyfield apologized Wednesday for predicting
a third-round knockout over Lennox Lewis and reiterated his desire
for a rematch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was wrong by even saying that, even though I felt I would
take him out in three rounds,'' Holyfield said in his first
interview since Saturday night, following a disputed draw with
Lewis in New York. ``By saying that, I made it hard, and I refused
to turn from it. I apologize for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield said he watched a tape of the fight Sunday, but when
asked how he scored it, he said, ``I never took a pen to it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're both champions,'' Holyfield said, referring to his WBA
and IBF belts and Lewis's WBC title. ``I could see why the judges
thought neither one of us took the fight from the other guy. The
judges said it's a draw. Realistically, he didn't knock me out, and
I didn't knock him out. It's all based on a decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even with the punch stats, people say, `Well, this man hit you
600 times.' But if he hit me that much, why didn't I fall? How come
I was never staggered or hurt? Obviously, because a lot of times he
was tapping me. Why? Because I was trying to get him to get close
to me so that I could nail him with a big shot. But it didn't work.
When boxers don't do what they're supposed to do, it falls into the
judges' hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time (Lewis) didn' get a decision. His whole
thing was to let it go to the scorecards. My thing is I never want
it to go to the scorecards. It never works out for me. People say,
`But you didn't raise your hands after the fight, and Lennox raised
his hands.' But even when I knock people out, I don't raise my
hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he could see why most people felt he was outpointed,
Holyfield reiterated, ``When I watch a fight, I'm watching to see
what mistakes I made, to get something out of it. If I start
scoring it, I'd start looking for why I thought I won instead of
getting something out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield spoke on a variety subjects, including:
</P>
<P>
   _ His health. He confirmed remarks from his attorney Jim Thomas,
who said that he did not feel well immediately before the fight and
that it was a ``difficult camp,'' alluding to a virus and other
ailments, including leg cramps during the bout. Holyfield was
examined by physician Christopher Vaughns on Wednesday and might
see an endocrinologist.
</P>
<P>
   _ Conclusions that he ``grew old'' in this fight. ``Those are
just excuses. I'm 36. I don't know why people want me to be old.
Things happen. But when things happen, I don't go looking for
excuses. Lennox fought a good fight.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Whether the prediction of a third-round KO was a distraction.
``No, I had a game plan. Unfortunately, the cramps in my legs
prevented me from taking those steps away from his jab. Boxing is
all about position. In one sense, (the prediction) helped me
because I felt real bad before the fight, but I was thinking,
`Shoot, it'll be a short night, so let me get in there.' When it
didn't happen, I thought, `Well, Lord, I was wrong.' God wasn't
wrong. I was wrong _ and now that I know I'm wrong, Lord help me.
... (But) I truly believe (Lewis) was scared in the third round.
When I hit him with some big shots, his eyes got big.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The rematch. ``He can't beat me the same way. Don't think that
I'm going to come back and be the same. What he did was very
effective. I've got the bruises to show that he was effective. I
got punished enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield said he is ``willing to be flexible'' in negotiations
and fight for a lower guarantee than the $20 million he earned
Saturday. He also said he wrote letters to his trainers and camp
members.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted them to know how appreciative I was for this last
camp, and how important it was that we stay together,'' Holyfield
said. ``Sometimes when things don't go well, a fighter fires
everybody. I wanted them to know I'm not putting the blame on
anybody.

 &HT;    Robinson's future in doubt
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Coach Dan Reeves conceded here Wednesday that it is
``a possibility'' free safety Eugene Robinson might not be back
with the Falcons in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But Reeves said no decision has been made and emphasized that
the decision will have nothing to do with the 14-year veteran's
arrest the night before Super Bowl XXXIV on charges of soliciting
oral sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he is not back with us,'' Reeves said during the annual
coaches' breakfast with the media, ``it won't have anything to do
with that situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves was asked frequently about Robinson during the one-hour
session and allowed that, while originally angered by the incident,
he quickly became more concerned on Super Bowl eve with Robinson
and his family. He said he left the decision on whether to play
Robinson to the player himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was I disappointed?'' Reeves said. ``Sure. But not every
response is done by anger. My immediate reaction was what could I
do to get Eugene through this. I don't really know that Eugene
understands why it happened. All of us have done something in our
lives where we have looked back and said, `Why did I do that?' ''
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of last week's acquisition of unrestricted free
agent strong safety Marty Carter, there have been rumors that
Robinson's release is imminent. Reeves noted during an afternoon
interview that the two men play different positions. He said,
though, that the size of Carter's contract _ a five-year, $15
million deal with a $1.42 million salary cap figure for 1999 _
might force the club to make some adjustments to fill other needs.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson is entering the final season of a two-year, $3.55
million contract. His salary cap figure for 1999 is $2.3 million,
and the Falcons will be rebated $1.8 million if he is released.
Reeves said cornerback Ronnie Bradford, re-signed to a four-year
deal for $7 million, could possibly be used at free safety. ``We
re-signed Ronnie with the intent he might play there,'' Reeves
said.
</P>
<P>
   BRIEFLY ...
</P>
<P>
   New York financier Howard Milstein, whose bid to purchase the
Redskins would not have been approved had it come to a vote, was
granted an extension to allow him time to address issues raised by
the Finance Committee. ... Owners passed a rule change that makes
it illegal for blockers to clip defensive linemen between the
tackles and in a 3-yard area on either side of the line of
scrimmage. Falcons defensive end Chuck Smith was among the players
who pushed for the change. ... Seattle is close to a trade to
acquire backup quarterback Glenn Foley from the New York Jets. ...
New Orleans coach Mike Ditka offered all of his '99 picks to
Philadelphia for the second overall choice in the draft. Ditka has
targeted Heisman tailback Ricky Williams.

 &HT;    `Mood right' to OK replay
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ It may have been a mid-February suggestion by
commissioner Paul Tagliabue _ one that permits the league's coaches
to concentrate on game action in the final two minutes of each half
instead of some officiating injustice _ that spurred the
resurrection of instant replay for the 1999 NFL season.
</P>
<P>
   More likely, however, it was a '98 campaign marred by frequent
officiating gaffes that prompted owners on Wednesday to haul the
sideline monitors out of mothballs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mood,'' acknowledged Seattle coach Mike Holmgren,
co-chairman of the Competition Committee, ``was right. We had to do
this thing now.''
</P>
<P>
   Following several controversial officiating errors last season,
the mood actually was ugly. With public confidence in the officials
ebbing after highly publicized decisions in some late-season games,
the NFL was left with very little recourse. So heightened was the
need for replay that seven franchises that voted against it in '98
voted to approve it Wednesday. Even the staunchest proponents said
they were surprised by the overwhelming 28-3 vote to afford replay
another chance.
</P>
<P>
   The three teams that voted against replay were Cincinnati,
Arizona and the New York Jets. The Bengals and Cardinals have voted
against replay every time it's been brought before the membership,
dating back to 1986. Among the owners who changed their votes was
Ralph Wilson of Buffalo, who traditionally has opposed replay but
whose team was victimized by poor calls in at least two games in
'98.
</P>
<P>
   Approval of the system is for 1999 only and it will be revisited
next spring.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most vocal replay supporters has been Falcons coach
Dan Reeves, and he was pleased by Wednesday's lopsided vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just never want to lose a game on a play everyone clearly
sees as wrong,'' Reeves said.
</P>
<P>
   The idea that the new system is being implemented to correct
glaring errors at key junctures of a game was one espoused by
Holmgren, committee co-chairman Rich McKay and director of
officiating Jerry Seeman.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't going to correct every (bad) call and it's not
designed to do that,'' said McKay, general manager of the Tampa Bay
Buccaneers. ``It's really meant to correct the huge oversight or
official's error.''
</P>
<P>
   The system affords coaches two ``challenges'' per game. If the
original call is upheld, a challenging team will be charged with a
timeout. In the final two minutes of a half a review may be
triggered only by a replay assistant in a booth above field level.
Plays that fall under the purview of replay include sideline, end
zone and possession calls.

 &HT;    Amid game's flash, scoring slows
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ College basketball owns March: Everyone
from your accountant to your grandmother to your favorite zoologist
has filled out an NCAA Tournament bracket.
</P>
<P>
   But beneath the surface exist real concerns that the game is in
trouble. Somewhere along the line, college basketball teams have
forgotten how to score. Like it or not, scoring sells tickets and
turns on television sets.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few symptoms of the offensive drought:
</P>
<P>
   _ Eight years ago, Division I college basketball teams averaged
76.7 points per game during the regular season. This season, that
figure was down to 70.5.
</P>
<P>
   _ The average shooting percentage per team, which was 47.3 in
1989, has dropped to 43.7.
</P>
<P>
   _ In last week's 48 NCAA Tournament games, 28 teams scored fewer
than 60 points, twice as many teams as in the first two rounds in
1998. In the six games of the Charlotte site in the East, eight of
the 12 teams shot under 40 percent. Four shot under 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   _ Wisconsin was held to an NCAA Tournament low 32 points after
shooting 25.5 percent against Southwest Missouri State. The
Badgers' football team scored more points in the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm embarrassed,'' coach Dick Bennett said.
</P>
<P>
   The guardians of the game are more than embarrassed. With
television ratings down for this tournament, they are worried that
the game could be in a decline and are wondering if anything can be
done about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It needs some tinkering,'' former Providence coach Dave Gavitt
told the Washington Post earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Logically, scoring should not be down. College basketball has a
short three-point line, at 19 feet, 9 inches; a lot of TV timeouts
that keep players fresh; and a 35-second shot clock to keep things
moving. Those rules changes were put in for the 1986-87 season in
an attempt to generate more offense.
</P>
<P>
   So what happened? The reasons for the decline in scoring are
many, but here are the most common ones, according to coaches and
basketball analysts:
</P>
<P>
   _ The SportsCenter Syndrome. Players no longer work on or have
the discipline for the finer points of the game _ passing, cutting,
screening _ that create high-percentage shots. The plays that make
the TV highlights are dunks and long 3-point shots. The
medium-range jump shot is in decline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kind of hard to blame a guy for passing up the 15-footer when
he can take one big step back and get three,'' said Steve Alford,
the head coach at Southwest Missouri State.
</P>
<P>
   _ Defensive domination. Coaches have learned to control the game
with a sophisticated combination of defenses played by bigger and
faster athletes. Where college basketball once was a finesse game,
a player strolling uncontested down the lane now is more likely to
end up in the seats. Every shot, every pass, every movement on the
floor is contested. Coaches encourage the physical play on the
theory that the officials can't call everything.
</P>
<P>
   _ Talent drain. Early defections to the NBA are starting to take
their toll on the quality of play. The ACC, for example, should
have had a senior class of 29 this season. Instead, there were 12
seniors playing meaningful roles on the nine ACC teams.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Krzyzewski, who won national championships in 1991 and 1992
with senior-oriented teams, has never had a player leave early for
the pros in 19 seasons as Duke's coach. That could change this year
with talented sophomores William Avery and Elton Brand. Krzyzewski
says it is something college basketball will have to overcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will be very difficult to have the great, old
experienced teams again,'' Krzyzewski said. ``My '92 team knew
everything. They were juniors and seniors and talented sophomores.
I'm not sure you'll get it at that level any more.''
</P>
<P>
   While the departure of talent might continue, basketball can
make changes to open up the game and make it less physical, coaches
say.
</P>
<P>
   The 3-point line, for example, could be moved out at least a
foot. That move would bring back the medium-range jumper, a
higher-percentage shot, and open up the inside, because perimeter
defenders would have a tougher time dropping back to help.
</P>
<P>
   The three-second lane could be widened at the base, as is the
case in international basketball. That would bring the big guys
farther from the basket and create passing and driving lanes.
</P>
<P>
   Some people have talked about shortening the shot clock, because
coaches, particularly at tournament time, have become adept at
milking it to reduce the number of possessions in a game.
</P>
<P>
   If the basketball powers are smart, they will make some changes
soon, because the players are not having a whole lot of fun with
the status quo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys get tight in the tournament, because it's one game and
out, but they really like to run and shoot and have fun,'' Duke's
Chris Carrawell said. ``Players don't like grabbing and holding and
banging.

 &HT;    Price joins Georgia Tech staff
 &HT;    By Norman Arey
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ With his second losing season in three years in the
books, Bobby Cremins has taken some steps that should bolster his
coaching staff and improve Georgia Tech's overall appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Former All-NBA guard Mark Price, who played for Cremins at Tech
from 1983-86, is joining the Yellow Jackets coaching staff as an
assistant coach. Price, who retired in February from the NBA, will
join Cremins' staff immediately as an assistant coach in a
nonrecruiting capacity.
</P>
<P>
   In related moves, Frank Beall, who held the title of director of
basketball operations, is leaving Tech to go into private business
and present assistant coach Gary Leiner will assume Beall's
noncoaching duties. Price will likely assume Leiner's current role.
</P>
<P>
   Unrelated to Price's hiring, assistant coach Dereck Whittenburg
has interviewed for the head coaching job at the University of
North Carolina-Greensboro, and it has been reported that East
Carolina also is interested in talking to the former N.C. State
star. Whittenburg's status on the Tech staff is unaffected by the
hiring of Price.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever since Mark retired, he's been thinking about getting into
coaching,'' said Cremins. ``The opportunity to have him on our
staff is just tremendous for us. Mark will be heavily involved in
individual player development and all aspects of coaching. He has
my utmost respect as a person and as a player.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a thrill to be able to come back to my alma mater and be
a part of (Cremins') coaching staff,'' Price said from his home in
Duluth. ``I feel I can be an asset in the development of the
players. I look forward to helping in any way I can.

<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   AUBURN VS. OHIO STATE
</P>
<P>
   When; where: 9:55 p.m. today; Thompson-Boling Arena, Knoxville.
</P>
<P>
   TV: CBS.
</P>
<P>
   Records: Auburn 29-3, Ohio State 25-8.
</P>
<P>
   Coaches: Cliff Ellis is 96-58 in five seasons at Auburn, 444-270
overall; Jim O'Brien is 33-30 in two seasons at Ohio State, 268-247
overall.
</P>
<P>
   How they got here: Auburn, the top seed, routed Winthrop 81-42
in the first round, then held off Oklahoma State 81-74 in the
second round. Ohio State, the fourth seed, beat Murray State 72-58
in the first round, then beat Detroit 75-44 in the second round.
</P>
<P>
   Probable lineups: Auburn _ guards, Doc Robinson (6-2, jr., 11.3
ppg) and Scott Pohlman (6-2, so., 12.3 ppg); center, Mamadou
N'diaye (7-0, jr., 7.4 ppg); forwards, Chris Porter (6-7, jr., 16.2
ppg) and Bryant Smith (6-5, sr., 10.8 ppg). Ohio State _ guards,
Scoonie Penn (5-10, jr., 16.7 ppg) and Brian Brown (6-3, fr., 3.9
ppg); center, Ken Johnson (6-11, jr., 6.3 ppg); forwards, Michael
Redd (6-6, so., 19.7 ppg) and Jason Singleton (6-5, sr., 8.8 ppg).
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: Both teams have had major turnarounds this season,
Auburn improving from 16 wins to 29 and Ohio State from eight to
25. Auburn's seven-point victory over Oklahoma State was just the
Tigers' third single-digit win all season. Their full-court game,
trapping defense and offensive-rebounding ability are major
concerns for Ohio State. Auburn had 242 more offensive boards than
its opponents and an overall rebounding count of 44.1-34.8. Ohio
State, with point guard Scoonie Penn, will try to slow down the
Tigers, and forward Jason Singleton must keep Chris Porter, the SEC
Player of the Year, off the offensive glass. The Buckeyes played
terrific defense in the first two rounds, holding Murray State to
27.3 per cent shooting and Detroit to 30.8. But Auburn should prove
far tougher.
</P>
<P>
   Prediction: Auburn 79-72.
</P>
<P>
   MARYLAND VS. ST. JOHN'S
</P>
<P>
   When; where: 7:38 p.m. today; Thompson-Boling Arena, Knoxville.
</P>
<P>
   TV/radio: CBS; WQXI (790 AM).
</P>
<P>
   Records: Maryland 28-5, St. John's 27-8.
</P>
<P>
   Coaches: Gary Williams is 192-117 in 10 seasons at Maryland,
399-244 overall; Mike Jarvis is 27-8 in his first season at St.
John's, 280-149 overall.
</P>
<P>
   How they got here: Maryland, the second seed, defeated
Valparaiso 82-60 in the first round, then eliminated Creighton
75-63. St. John's, the third seed, crushed Samford 69-43 in the
first round, then gave Indiana its worst NCAA Tournament loss,
86-61.
</P>
<P>
   Probable lineups: Maryland _ guards, Steve Francis (6-3, jr.,
16.6 ppg) and Terrell Stokes (6-0, sr., 6.5 ppg); center, Lonny
Baxter (6-8, fr., 6.1 ppg); forwards Terence Morris (6-9, so., 15.8
ppg) and Laron Profit (6-5, sr., 14.8 ppg). St. John's _ guards,
Erick Barkley (6-1, fr., 13.2 ppg) and Bootsy Thornton (6-4, jr.,
14.7 ppg); center, Tyrone Grant (6-7, sr., 10.8 ppg); forwards, Ron
Artest (6-7, so., 14.8 ppg) and Lavor Postell (6-6, jr., 12.9 ppg).
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: Potentially, this could be the most exciting game of
the tournament thus far. The teams are talented and explosive, with
an array of scorers, each coming off two solids wins in Orlando.
The Terps want to run, especially when the aerodynamic Francis can
get the ball in transition or on lobs to the hoop. He might be the
college game's only leaper to rival Chris Porter. Maryland also has
played tough defense the first two rounds, limiting Valparaiso to
35.6 per cent shooting and Creighton 34.4. Although St. John's has
the ability to run with the Terps, the Johnnies are better suited
to a half-court game against a club averaging 85.2 points. Look for
the Red Storm to use the 2-3 zone Mike Jarvis employed after
Indiana took a 15-9 lead against the St. John's man-to-man defense.
The Johnnies moved the ball beautifully against the Hoosiers.
</P>
<P>
   Prediction: Maryland 82-80.

 &HT;    Top seeds remain in South Regional
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KNOXVILLE, Tenn. _ Up here in the Smokies sits an oasis of
sanity in the madness that is March. No demon seeds are left. Let
the other three sites salute those wacky college kids from
Southwest Missouri State, Miami of Ohio and Gonzaga. This is the
only place that offers some semblance of order on the court in the
NCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   That, and much more.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the South Regional, it is almost like a Final
Four,'' said Auburn coach Cliff Ellis, whose top-seeded Tigers meet
No. 4 Ohio State tonight in the regional semifinals, following the
opener between No. 2 Maryland and No. 3 St. John's. Of the four
regions, only the South had all four top seeds reach the Sweet 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``Duke's not here, and let's assume they're going to be there
(in the Final Four),'' Ellis said. ``Any one of these teams could
be there. This is the one region that has really proven to be
strong, and whoever comes out of here is going to be a great
representative.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at this region and the four teams that are here,
you're looking at not good basketball teams but great basketball
teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Four great teams with an aggregate record of 109-24, who won
their eight first- and second-round games by an average margin of
22 points. Only one victory _ Auburn's 81-74 win over Oklahoma
State on Saturday _ was a single-digit affair. Although all four
top seeds are still alive, only one other region _ the Midwest,
with No. 1 Michigan State and No. 3 Kentucky _ has more than one of
its top four remaining. Here in the deep South, in the upper
left-hand corner of your NCAA brackets, favoritism is not a dirty
word.
</P>
<P>
   ``This regional is a little different. Every team that was
supposed to make the Sweet 16 made it,'' St. John's forward Ron
Artest said. Artest was limping in practice Wednesday because he
got sick after supper Tuesday night, tripped over his roommate's
bed trying to make it to the bathroom and hurt a foot.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of upsets in the other regionals,'' said
Artest, one of five St. John's starters who scored in double
figures in Saturday's 86-61 humbling of Indiana. ``This regional is
probably a little more competitive. People know they can't slack
up. The games here are going to be real hard, and we have to fight
fatigue or anything else to win.''
</P>
<P>
   That's if the Johnnies are to prolong what first-year coach Mike
Jarvis calls ``a fantastic journey.''
</P>
<P>
   St. John's, seeking its first Final Four appearance since 1985,
must contend with quicksilver Maryland, which is in its third Sweet
16 in a row and is two wins away from the school's first Final
Four.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told everyone when the brackets first came out our region
was the toughest and most exciting,'' Terps forward Laron Profit
said. ``It's proven out. If you look at the four teams, they're all
very similar. They're all very athletic. All have great guard play.
All put defensive pressure on you.''
</P>
<P>
   And all four are here on merit. ``The four teams that are seeded
(highest) here really played well,'' Maryland coach Gary Williams
said. ``In some other regions, the top seeds didn't play well.
Nobody (here) really had a bad game in those first four seeds.''
</P>
<P>
   Including Ohio State, which staggered through an 8-22 death
march last season. But guard Scoonie Penn, who sat out last season
after transferring from Boston College, predicted at the start of
this season that the Buckeyes would make the NCAAs. ``I thought he
was off the wall,'' said Jim O'Brien, the coach Penn followed from
B.C. to Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   Now Ohio State is nearly off the charts with Scoonie. A 17-win
improvement has the Buckeyes 25-8, which, even so, is the worst
record of the four teams here. Not that seeds or records matter
now, O'Brien said. ``If you get a chance to win this game, it puts
you one game away from the Final Four.

<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   GONZAGA VS. FLORIDA
</P>
<P>
   When, where: 7:55 p.m. today; America West Arena, Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   TV: CBS.
</P>
<P>
   Records: Gonzaga 27-6, Florida 22-8.
</P>
<P>
   Coaches: Don Monson is 51-16 in two seasons at Gonzaga. Billy
Donovan is 48-40 in three seasons at Florida and 83-60 overall.
</P>
<P>
   How they got here: Gonzaga upset seventh-seeded Minnesota 75-63
in the first round and second-seed Stanford 82-74 in the second.
Florida defeated Pennsylvania 75-61 in the first round and beat
Weber State 82-74 in overtime in Round 2.
</P>
<P>
   Probable lineups: Gonzaga _ guards, Quentin Hall (5-8, sr., 11.4
ppg) and Matt Santangelo (6-1, jr., 12.7 ppg); center, Jeremy Eaton
(6-11, sr., 12.1 ppg); forwards, Richie Frahm (6-5, jr., 14.2 ppg)
and Casey Calvary (6-8, so., 9.4 ppg). Florida _ guards, Eddie
Shannon (5-11, sr., 6.8 ppg) and Kenyan Weaks (6-4, jr., 11.4 ppg);
forwards, Greg Stolt (6-9, sr., 10.3 ppg), Major Parker (6-4, so.,
5.2 ppg) and Brent Wright (6-8, so., 8.0 ppg).
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: Florida coach Billy Donovan, like mentor Rick Pitino,
likes to go 10 players deep; two of the Gators' top three scorers,
Mike Miller (12.4) and Teddy Dupay (11.0) come off the bench.
Florida, with 11 players averaging at least 10 minutes, will try to
wear down a slightly thinner Gonzaga squad in the second half. Like
Florida, the Bulldogs shoot the 3-pointer well; they have three
snipers with more than 50 each.
</P>
<P>
   Prediction: Florida 79-72.
</P>
<P>
   CONNECTICUT VS. IOWA
</P>
<P>
   When, where: 10:15 p.m. today; America West Arena, Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   TV/radio: CBS; WQXI (790 AM).
</P>
<P>
   Records: Connecticut 30-2, Iowa 20-9.
</P>
<P>
   Coaches: Jim Calhoun is 300-120 in 13 seasons at Connecticut,
550-257 overall. Tom Davis is 269-139 in 13 seasons at Iowa and
543-289 overall.
</P>
<P>
   How they got here: The top-seeded Huskies routed Texas-San
Antonio in the first round 91-66 and defeated New Mexico 78-56 in
the second. The Hawkeyes beat Alabama-Birmingham 77-64 in the first
round before upsetting No. 4-seed Arkansas 82-72.
</P>
<P>
   Possible lineups: Connecticut _ guards, Khalid El-Amin (5-11,
so., 13.5 ppg) and Ricky Moore (6-2, sr., 6.5 ppg); center, Jake
Voskuhl (6-11, jr., 5.8 ppg); forwards, Kevin Freeman (6-7, jr.,
12.8 ppg) and Richard Hamilton (6-6, jr., 21.2 ppg). Iowa _ guards,
Dean Oliver (5-11, so., 12.0 ppg), Kent McCausland (6-3, sr., 8.3
ppg) and Jason Bauer (6-3, sr., 2.7 ppg); forwards, Jess Settles
(6-7, sr., 9.8 ppg) and J.R. Koch (6-10, sr., 9.8 ppg).
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: Although the Hawkeyes won just five of their last 13
regular-season games, the team is riding an NCAA high in coach Tom
Davis' farewell campaign. Iowa's grit and deep bench, however,
won't be enough against an athletic UConn outfit. Richard Hamilton
is a player-of-the-year candidate and, like his teammates, runs the
floor well. Underrated pivot Jake Voskuhl is playing with a stress
fracture in his foot and coach Jim Calhoun has to limit his
minutes, but Voskuhl is a key.
</P>
<P>
   Prediction: Connecticut 84-69.

 &HT;    Gators' success has Donovan a hot commodity
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ As he settled into the chair kept warm for the
previous half-hour by Billy Donovan, a reporter asked Tom Davis
about the irony of following the Florida coach to the podium for
Wednesday's news conferences here. The Iowa coach, forced to
announce his retirement even before this season began, smiled as if
to confirm that he has heard the rumors Donovan might succeed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has done a tremendous job in a very, very short time,''
Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   The surprising Gators, a team that seems to be about a season
ahead of expectations, hope the instant success doesn't make
Donovan a short-timer. Florida meets upstart Gonzaga here this
evening seeking a berth in the Elite Eight. The second matchup at
America West Arena is top-seeded Connecticut against Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Donovan rebuffed all efforts to suggest that
he merely is passing through Gainesville on his way to a job at a
higher-profile basketball school. And given that Gators coffers are
even deeper than his bench, and that Donovan has elevated the
program in only three years, perhaps he will spend his entire
career in orange-and-blue neckties.
</P>
<P>
   But even the most youthful Gators realize that Donovan's 48-40
record, along with the promise of continued success fueled by a
superior freshman class, means the rumors of their coach being
pursued by other schools figure to be an annual rite of spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd have to be naive to think people aren't going to be
interested in him,'' said freshman forward Mike Miller, the team's
leading scorer. ``The guy is a hot commodity, and deservedly so.
But I don't think he's going anywhere. There are a lot of things he
wants to accomplish here. We have people to accomplish them.''
Typical of a coaching style he learned from Rick Pitino, his
acknowledged mentor, Donovan will attempt to extend the Gators'
tournament run tonight with the tag-team approach, going to his
reserves early and often against Gonzaga, one of the Cinderella
sagas of the past two weeks. The Bulldogs are aptly named, a gritty
bunch that scraps for every loose ball. What's been overlooked is
that Gonzaga, a No. 10 seed in the West, also possesses some pretty
nice talent.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Santangelo, a junior and one of three guards to connect on
50 or more three-point shots, has overcome a late-season shooting
slump to spark Gonzaga. Donovan insisted, though, that the
Bulldogs' quickness and ballhandling won't keep him from pressing.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's who we are, and it's what we do,'' Donovan said. ``We
won't change, and I doubt they will, either. They're a very nice
team, and they're the sweethearts out here. People are pulling for
them, and no one in the West knows much about us. But if we keep
going forward, our team will get plenty of exposure.

PARALLELS FILL EASTWOOD'S DEATH ROW DRAMA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GLENN WHIPP 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In ``True Crime,'' Clint Eastwood plays a
grizzled, amoral newspaper reporter who has no problem saying he's
sorry. Meaning it, however, is an altogether different proposition.
</P>
<P>
   Eastwood's Steve Everett has a lot to apologize for. He's a
boozer and has lost jobs because his binges affected his judgment.
He's a womanizer not above sleeping with the boss's wife just for
the kick of it. He's a bad husband, a pathetic father, a selfish
friend and a canny liar. And because he's played by Clint Eastwood,
he's just the kind of rascal you grudgingly root for and like.
</P>
<P>
   Everett's 24-hour journey of personal redemption is one of the
best things about ``True Crime,'' a taut, sober film about a
journalist trying to save a man from Death Row and, in the process,
rescue himself from life's gutter.
</P>
<P>
   Eastwood, who also directed the film, contrasts Everett's race
with the clock with that of the movie's doomed prisoner, Frank
Beachum (the excellent Isaiah Washington), now a born-again
Christian resigned to be executed for a murder he says he did not
commit. The parallel stories are intertwined in a gripping manner
that, up until some glaringly contrived moments late in the film,
transcends Hollywood formula and revels in small, expertly observed
nuances of character.
</P>
<P>
   Everett learns on the morning of the Beachum execution that he
has been assigned to write a ``human-interest'' story on the
convicted murderer's last hours. This type of puff piece is
anathema to Everett, and he immediately starts digging into the
more circumstantial aspects of the case, much to the consternation
of his paper's insecure city editor, Bob (Denis Leary). Of course,
Bob has reason to be insecure, having just learned that his wife
has been sleeping with Everett that very same morning.
</P>
<P>
   Such free-lancing, needless to say, only adds to Everett's
already tenuous standing at the paper. Everett doesn't care. He
stakes his professional reputation on being able to come up with
proof _ by the midnight hour _ that will save Beachum from lethal
injection.
</P>
<P>
   The screenplay _ written by Larry Gross, Paul Brickman and
Stephen Schiff _ has a sharp eye for detail. The newsroom scenes
crackle with energy, thanks to Leary and a manic James Woods, who
plays the paper's gruff, profane editor with an over-the-top gusto.
</P>
<P>
   When the action shifts to the prison, the restrained Washington
gives the action a quiet grace and dignity. Not since ``Dead Man
Walking'' has Death Row been captured in such a detached, clinical
and heart-rending manner.
</P>
<P>
   Eastwood doesn't escape all the cliches of the beat-the-clock
genre. Far-fetched discoveries are made time and time again, and
the film's finale includes some tire-squealing heroics that seem at
odds with the kind of meticulous character study that Eastwood has
been building. Such contrivances are hard to avoid, but ``True
Crime'' would have been an even better movie if the plot mechanics
had been more challenging _ both to the audience and the film's
characters.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the movie is the way
Eastwood uses Everett to own up to his own off-screen
indiscretions, going so far as casting former companion Frances
Fisher as a district attorney who reads him the riot act in one
jolting scene. Their daughter, Francesca Fisher-Eastwood, is also
on board, playing (quite naturally, thank you) Everett's
long-suffering little girl.
</P>
<P>
   If ``True Crime'' is Eastwood's mea culpa, it's a pretty
convincing one. Naturally, the movie is still Clint being Clint, so
there's little doubt about the triumphant power of redemption. Just
because Eastwood is playing a journalist doesn't mean he has to be
completely objective. &QL;

HOUSE VOTES TO LIMIT STEEL IMPORTS 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House voted decisively on Wednesday to limit
steel imports, ignoring opposition from the Republican leadership
and a White House warning that the measure would violate world
trade agreements.
</P>
<P>
   The 289-141 vote _ one short of the two-thirds margin needed to
override a presidential veto _ displayed the division in the
Democratic Party over President Clinton's free trade policies as
well as the draw of protectionism to Republicans from the Rust
Belt. All but 13 of the House Democrats deserted the
administration. And 91 Republicans, a surprisingly strong number,
also bolted from their party's traditional free-trade position.
</P>
<P>
   The bill _ the first major trade measure of the congressional
session _ directs the United States to limit steel imports from
other nations to their average monthly volume for the three-year
period ending July 1997. It would be up to the administration to
decide whether to do so through quotas, tariffs or voluntary
agreements.
</P>
<P>
   The day's debate and off-stage lobbying showed the strange
coalitions that have developed over trade policy and the growth in
protectionist sentiments. When a measure to give the president
broader powers to negotiate trade deals was defeated last year, 71
Republicans voted against it. In this instance, 20 more Republicans
took a stand against unfettered free trade. Steel and fast-track
trade negotiations are the two targets of protectionists lobbying.
</P>
<P>
   With worldwide demand hurt by Asia's financial crisis, foreign
steel makers have been selling at below-market levels. The American
steel industry has seen a drop in business while imports rose 33
percent in 1998 before they began to subside in December. The
Clinton administration last month announced that it would impose
anti-dumping tariffs to punish Japan and Brazil and negotiated an
agreement with Russia to limit imports.
</P>
<P>
   The stricter limits passed by the House are unlikely to become
law. The bill's fate in the Senate is uncertain, but a presidential
veto is likely. In a letter to the House, the White House chief of
staff, John Podesta, acknowledged the steel crisis but warned that
the measure ``constitutes a violation of our international
obligations'' under the World Trade Organization and ``is not in
our nation's economic interest.'' He said Clinton's senior advisers
would recommend that he veto the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the vote showed how difficult, if not impossible, it will
be to pass in this Congress a long sought measure, known as
``fast-track,'' to give the president sweeping powers to negotiate
new trade agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dennis Hastert of Illinois, the speaker of the House, also
opposed the bill as a violation of free trade. But the bill's
supporters had enough backing to likely be able to force a vote,
and he let the measure come to the floor. His spokesman, John P.
Feehery, said that some Republicans ``were pushing very strongly
for a debate, and we also wanted to avoid the other parliamentary
shenanigans.'' The House Ways and Means Committee, strongly in
favor of free trade, reported the bill to the floor with the
recommendation that it be defeated.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Buchanan, the Republican presidential contender who has
challenged the party establishment, wrote to House Republicans on
Tuesday urging them to support the bill to ``regain the loyalty of
working Americans.'' And Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri, the
minority leader, despite his recent endorsement of Vice President
Al Gore, spoke out in favor of the bill, giving a hint of the
debate that might have been if he had run for president.
</P>
<P>
   Organized labor was also working hard for the bill, and the
United Steelworkers had several hundred rank-and-file members on
hand for the final push.
</P>
<P>
   ``An economic collapse has swept the globe,'' Gephardt said,
``first striking Asia, but now impacting Latin America and other
developing countries as well. During the debate over IMF emergency
funding to stabilize these economies, I warned that import surges
would result from the Asian economic crisis and that a plan needed
to be in place to combat unfair imports. Unfortunately, no such
plan was forthcoming.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that 10,000 steel jobs had been lost to the import
surge. ``Our steel industry is the most productive in the world.
The U.S. should not be forced to unilaterally take in a massive
global import surge.''
</P>
<P>
   Several senior Republicans argued against the bill, which was
sponsored by Rep. Pete Visclosky, D-Ind. They contended that the
American economy was thriving because of the new markets provided
by international trade. They also said the limits could hurt other
U.S. manufacturers by raising steel prices and cutting off the
supply of specialized steel products only available through
imports.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Archer, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee,
said that the president and his advisers had studied the steel
situation and chose not to set quotas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president's logic is clear,'' Archer, R-Texas, said. ``if
the U.S. were to set up trade barriers now in our fragile world
economy, we could have a much bigger problem on our hands that
would affect thousands more American jobs and threaten our economy.
In addition, we would set a terrible example for countries in real
economic trouble, countries whose leaders are under tremendous
pressure to retaliate against American-made products.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rust-belt Republicans as well as Democrats, took the side of
the steelworkers and steel industry. ``We're going to stand up for
Main Street today, not Wall Street,'' said Rep. Robert Ney, R-Ohio.
``That's why this bill is here. We're here because thousands of
steelworkers and citizens would not let this issue go, would not
let this issue die.''
</P>
<P>
   The limits in the House bill would reduce steel imports by 12
million tons from the levels of 1998, while still allowing about 29
million tons of steel into the country. At the height of the steel
import surge in 1998, 41 million tons of foreign steel was being
imported.
</P>
<P>
   The administration argued that the bill violated U.S.
obligations to the World Trade Organization because it would impose
a global limit on imports, instead of using allowed tools such as
tariffs to fight illegal dumping of imports.
</P>
<P>
   But confronted with the vote, Charlene Barshevsky, the U.S.
trade representative, said: ``While we oppose this legislation, we
are going to work with the Congress to address this issue.'' The
administration hopes eventually this session to muster support for
an alternate approach to the steel crisis and to support a bill
sponsored by Reps. Sander Levin, D-Mich., and Amo Houghton, R-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Their measure would change the trade law to make it easier and
quicker for the administration to take action in cases of import
surges.

   HOUSE VOTES TO PUT LIMITS ON STEEL IMPORTS
</P>
<P>
   The House voted decisively to limit steel imports, ignoring
opposition from the Republican leadership and an almost certain
veto by the White House, which argues that the measure would
violate world trade agreements. The bill _ the first major trade
measure of the new session of Congress _ directs the United States
to limit steel imports from other nations to about 29 million tons
of steel. It would be up to the Administration to decide whether to
do so through quotas, tariffs or voluntary agreements.
</P>
<P>
   GLOBAL CROSSING TO BUY FRONTIER
</P>
<P>
   Global Crossing of Bermuda, a new international communications
carrier, said that it had agreed to acquire Frontier, which serves
almost one million telephone customers in 13 states, for $10.8
billion in stock. Just three weeks ago, Global Crossing hired as

   STOCKS BACK OFF FROM 10,000

points, to 1,297.82. The Nasdaq composite index declined 10.30

percent on Tuesday. Prices declined on concern that $15 billion of
debt sales will draw demand from Treasury securities in coming
days.

</P>
<P>
   The investment bank Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, which rarely
holds a top spot among mergers-and-acquisitions advisers, has made
an impressive showing so far this year, advising on several recent
high-profile deals. The company's shares, which fell $3.0625, to
$65.75, in part because of uncertainty about plans for a stock that
tracks its on-line business, are up 39 percent since January.

PARK'S AGENT MAKES PITCHES OF HIS OWN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VERO BEACH, Fla. _ Chan Ho Park was determined to focus on the
catcher's mitt even as agent Steve Kim began contract talks with
Los Angeles Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's Steve Kim?'' Park said facetiously after giving up one
run in five innings in a 7-4 exhibition victory over the Montreal
Expos at Holman Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's doing his job,'' the pitcher said, ``and I'm doing my
job.''
</P>
<P>
   If Park does his job as he has in three improving seasons in Los
Angeles, he'll earn many times his current $2.3 million salary,
either by going free-agent upon becoming eligible in 2001 or by
signing a long-term contract before then.
</P>
<P>
   How much the 25-year-old Korean will make, and for how long,
could be determined by negotiations that began with a 20-minute
``exploratory'' meeting between Kim, Malone and Dodgers general
counsel Sam Fernandez.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looks around and sees Kevin Brown making $(105) million and
(Raul) Mondesi and others making $10 million a year ... I'd say
he's underpaid,'' said the L.A.-based Kim, who went home late
Wednesday. ``The ball's in the Dodgers' court.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone said the timing adds to the negotiating variables _ Park
can go to salary arbitration the next two winters, and free agency
is three seasons away. Malone also acknowledged the pitcher's
unique appeal to Korean-Americans ``carries some weight.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like Chan Ho to be here for a long time,'' Malone said.
</P>
<P>
   Park, whose spring ERA is 0.82, had success Wednesday with the
changeup he's adding to his repertoire, throwing it 10 to 12 times
in a 72-pitch outing and producing several ground balls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought about (contract issues) in the offseason,'' said
Park, who agreed to a two-year contract in February 1998, signing
away his first year of arbitration eligibility. ``But now I just
concentrate on training. I'm trying to get a good season, and after
that _ arbitration, free agency ... whew!''
</P>
<P>
   Lineup card: Here's one less complaint for Gary Sheffield: In a
switch, manager Davey Johnson indicated Sheffield will bat third,
which he prefers, and Raul Mondesi fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi's on-base percentage: .269.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield waved away reporters who approached his locker-room
stall Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Jack(s) of all trades: Outfielder Todd Hollandsworth earned a
``B-plus'' from Johnson in his second error-free start at first
base, where he could back up Eric Karros.
</P>
<P>
   ``You take (versatile infielder Jose Vizcaino) and
Hollandsworth, and they're as valuable as my top eight, even more
so,'' Johnson said. ``You don't win unless you have those kind of
players.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said Vizcaino is so valuable on the bench that if Eric
Young got hurt, he might put minor-leaguer Adam Riggs at second
base, keeping Vizcaino in the utility role.
</P>
<P>
   Medical dept.: Sidelined catcher Todd Hundley (elbow) and left
fielder Sheffield (shoulder) played catch from 75 feet as physical
therapist Pat Screnar watched.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield, in his second day of activity following a two-day
leave, had no pain, Screnar said. Hundley was ``stiff but
improved.''
</P>
<P>
   Good sign: Johnson liked what he saw in set-up reliever Mel
Rojas' perfect inning against the Expos: more fastballs.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is to break the 32-year-old's reliance on split-finger
and breaking pitches, which Johnson thinks cost him arm strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he thrives on a lot of work,'' the manager said.
``Well, I can do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Rojas (6.05 ERA in 1998) was happy to leave the New York Mets.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not going well in New York, you're in trouble,'' he
said. ``They booed Mike Piazza in New York!''
</P>
<P>
   In L.A. too, now.
</P>
<P>
   Bad sign: Johnson was unhappy with Young and outfielder Jacob
Brumfield for failing to try to hit to the right side with runners
on second.
</P>
<P>
   ``That (adhering to the fundamentals) impresses me more than the
bomb,'' he said. ``This is part of the spring and learning what I
expect.''
</P>
<P>
   A tradition lives on: Even though they're owned now by an
Australian, not an Irish-American, the Dodgers wore their green
caps in Wednesday's game, and the staff had the annual Dodgertown
St. Patrick's Day party.

SPORTS COLUMN: JUST THANK TESTAVERDE FOR REPLAY
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Vinny Testaverde's numbers as the Jets' quarterback
last season show only one rushing touchdown. One for the books, the
history books.
</P>
<P>
   In Testaverde's career statistics, that phantom touchdown for a
last-second 32-31 victory over the Seattle Seahawks deserves an
asterisk denoting the call that was so wrong it convinced the NFL
to do something right: bring back instant replay.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Testaverde play,'' a league official acknowledged, ``shook
people up.''
</P>
<P>
   Meaning the people with a vote _ owners, coaches and general
managers. And Wednesday, with 24 ``yes'' ballots needed, the clubs
voted, 28-3, to restore replay for the 1999 season, quite a jump
from last year's 21-9 turndown. Only the Jets, Arizona and
Cincinnati cast nay votes.
</P>
<P>
   For all the arguments extolling the absence of replay after its
use from 1986 to 1991, even its most dedicated defenders couldn't
argue with the injustice of the last-second Testaverde
``touchdown'' when he was stopped more than a yard short on a
fourth-down quarterback sneak.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks lost a game they should have won. It cost them the
playoffs, which then cost their coach, Dennis Erickson, his job.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets won a game they should have lost. Who knows how a loss
would have affected their psyches entering the final three games of
what turned out to be a 12-4 season?
</P>
<P>
   But the NFL's embarrassment of mistakes last season began 10
days before the Testaverde play occurred.
</P>
<P>
   It started with a referee's confusion over the coin toss before
the Steelers-Lions overtime on Thanksgiving Day.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Bills lost in New England, 25-21, on a desperation pass
after replays showed that Patriots receiver Shawn Jefferson had
been out of bounds when he caught a fourth-down pass for a first
down. Ralph Wilson, the Bills' owner, objected so angrily he was
fined $50,000 by Commissioner Paul Tagliabue.
</P>
<P>
   Will replay be perfect this time around? No. Will it slow up a
game occasionally while replays are reviewed? Yes. Will those
reviews be inconclusive occasionally? Yes. But will replay
determine the correct call much more often than not? Yes. Would it
have eliminated the catastrophically wrong Testaverde call? Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, pro football, like all Gaul in Caesar's time, has
been divided into three parts _ offense, defense and special teams.
But with the return of instant replay with a coach's challenge
system, there suddenly is a fourth part _ the coach's television
team.
</P>
<P>
   And instead of seven zebras, now there's an eighth _ the replay
official in an upstairs booth who will decide if a call in the last
two minutes of each half and in overtime deserves to be reviewed by
the referee peering into an instant-replay monitor on the field.
</P>
<P>
   If a controversial call occurs in the last two minutes or in
overtime, that replay official won't hesitate to beep the referee
to check the monitor. Let the referee make the call. But the NFL
must provide the clearest possible monitor for the referee to
check, especially if a hostile crowd is in full cry.
</P>
<P>
   But if a coach is to challenge an official's call in the first
28 minutes of either half and risk losing a timeout if the call is
not reversed after the referee's review, a coach usually will need
help from both his players and a spotter, say an assistant coach,
watching the network feed in an upstairs booth.
</P>
<P>
   Unless a controversial play occurs near a coach, or at least
along his sideline, a coach usually won't be able to tell
immediately if an official's call should be challenged.
</P>
<P>
   On Testaverde's phantom touchdown, for example, coach Bill
Parcells couldn't see from near midfield if his quarterback was in
the end zone. Parcells reacted only after Ernie Frantz, the head
linesman who was trailing the play by a yard or two, mistakenly
signaled touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   On the Seahawks' sideline, Erickson also couldn't see. He
reacted to his defensive players' objection to Frantz's call.
</P>
<P>
   But the two-minute warning now has a new meaning _ the start of
the replay official's responsibility to alert the referee to check
a game-turning call. This was Tagliabue's idea to take the coaches
off the hook in those crucial minutes.
</P>
<P>
   So drop a thank-you note to Vinny Testaverde for the touchdown
he really didn't score. &QL;

<P>
   HOUSTON _ A judge reduced bail from $40,000 to $5,000 Wednesday
for the father of Heisman Trophy winner Ricky Williams, who is
accused of embezzling more than $20,000 from a Houston nursing
home.
</P>
<P>
   At the arraignment in the 351st Criminal District Court,
visiting state District Judge Charles Hearn also appointed defense
attorney James Leitner to represent Errick Lynne Williams Sr., 41.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Terry Jennings and Leitner said they agreed on the
bail reduction. Jennings said he doesn't consider him a flight
risk.
</P>
<P>
   According to jail records, Williams made bail. Attempts to reach
him for comment were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   Leitner declined comment late Wednesday, saying he has had not
had time to review the case.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings said Errick Williams is accused of stealing $20,700
from the Lexington Place Healthcare Center between Oct. 20, 1997,
and Oct. 20, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Court documents allege that Errick Williams, who was working as
a housekeeping supervisor, created phony documents and timeslips
that showed his wife worked with him, Jennings said. She did not,
but Jennings said Williams collected her checks and cashed them.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' wife, Patricia Maria Williams, 36, has not been
charged.

NFL BACKS LIMITED REPLAY AFTER COMPLAINTS OF BAD CALLS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ After a seven-year absence, instant replay will return
this fall in the National Football League for a one-year trial.
</P>
<P>
   The move was approved by NFL owners, 28-3, Wednesday at their
annual meeting in the wake of an outcry stemming from controversial
calls by officials that had major impacts on several games last
season.
</P>
<P>
   Instant replay _ the use of television replays to correct
officials' obviously erroneous calls _ was used in the NFL from
1986 through 1991. It was dropped in 1992 after coaches and owners
complained that the system was cumbersome and slowed the pace of
games. The owners voted on whether to restore instant replay before
each of the last two seasons, but it was rejected both times.
</P>
<P>
   Rich McKay, general manager of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and
co-chairman of the league's competition committee, said officials
have told him that ``they typically preferred not to have replay
but were ready and willing to work with the system if that is what
the league wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of different points of view among us and it
has taken a long time to create a system that addressed three
issues,'' McKay said. ``First, in replay, we want to get the play
right. Then, we don't want to lengthen the game. Finally, we don't
want to ruin the pace of the game. We've come up with a system that
deals with all three of those issues.''
</P>
<P>
   The new instant-replay format has several elements.
</P>
<P>
   _ In each game, a team receives two chances to challenge an
official's call. If the team has no timeouts, it cannot challenge.
If the play call is overturned by the referee, who will review it
on a TV monitor on the sideline, the team making the challenge
retains its existing timeouts. If the play call is not overturned,
the team loses a timeout. (A team has three timeouts per half in
each game.)
</P>
<P>
   A call can be changed only if there is indisputable visual
evidence warranting the change.
</P>
<P>
   Under the old system, coaches could not challenge a call; only a
replay assistant could order a review.
</P>
<P>
   _ During the final two minutes of each half and in overtime, a
referee assistant located overhead in a booth can call for a
review.
</P>
<P>
   _ Each review will take a maximum of 90 seconds beginning when
the referee looks into his monitor.
</P>
<P>
   _ Reviewable matters include plays governed by the sideline,
goal line, end zone and end line and passing plays primarily
dealing with completion and possession.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 24 votes was needed for restoration. Last year,
Arizona, Buffalo, Chicago, Cincinnati, Kansas City, Oakland, Tampa
Bay, San Diego and the Giants voted against replay.
</P>
<P>
   This year only Arizona, Cincinnati and the Jets voted against
it. All three argued in similar fashion with long-time opponents of
replay: that the game is played by humans and is officiated by
humans and, thus, is prone to human error. Leave it as such. These
teams also felt that the system did not work efficiently before and
would not do so now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eight of the last nine years I've voted against replay,'' said
Lamar Hunt, owner of the Kansas City Chiefs. ``I voted for it this
time because I see an opportunity to use improved technology. I
have some misgivings. I still think there are imperfections in the
system, but let's see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Al Davis, general manager of the Oakland Raiders, liked the idea
of instant replay, but said: ``The use of the timeouts changes the
game. I'm going for it for one year and then maybe we can get the
challenges out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony Dungy, head coach of Tampa Bay, felt that officials may
become more whistle-shy.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a whistle blows, the play is over,'' Dungy said. ``No
official wants to blow a play dead on a possession call and then TV
shows the call was wrong. The officials now might say, `Hey, I'm
not going to blow my whistle; let replay do the work.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Seeman, the league's director of officiating, said: ``This
is not an all-encompassing system; it's the type of system that
helps out, that tries to take TV replays and turn them into a
positive. It's being used on a limited basis and it's not
obtrusive. It will correct those three or four controversial calls
a year out of the entire season that are so high profile.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Rooney, the Pittsburgh Steelers' owner, said: ``My greatest
hope is that it works. My greatest fear is that it won't.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The outcry for instant replay, which reached a fevered pitch
before the playoffs in December, was driven by a highly publicized
series of gaffes and questionable calls late in the season.
</P>
<P>
   _ On Thanksgiving Day in Detroit, officials botched the coin
toss at the beginning of overtime, giving the ball to Detroit even
though replays showed Pittsburgh's Jerome Bettis correctly calling
``tails.'' The Lions drove for the winning field goal. Instant
replay would not have been used in that case, but the mistake was
broadcast repeatedly and began to focus attention on the officials'
performance.
</P>
<P>
   _ Two calls made the difference in the Buffalo Bills' 25-21 loss
to the New England Patriots three days later. Patriots receiver
Shawn Jefferson was called inbounds on a fourth-and-9 pass play,
though replays showed he was out. Then Buffalo was called for
interference on a desperation pass into the end zone as players on
both teams jostled for the ball. That call set up the Patriots'
winning touchdown. The Bills' owner, Ralph Wilson, lashed out at
the officiating afterward and was fined $50,000 by Commissioner
Paul Tagliabue.
</P>
<P>
   _ Vinny Testaverde scored the winning touchdown on a
last-second, fourth-down quarterback sneak in the Jets' 32-31
victory over the Seattle Seahawks on Dec. 6. Replays clearly showed
that Testaverde was down before he reached the goal line.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL announced the day after the Jets-Seahawks game that it
would ask owners to vote on instant replay for the playoffs and
Super Bowl, but retracted the proposal before the first playoff
round. That first round then saw two more controversial calls:
Jerry Rice of the 49ers was ruled down before he lost a fumble to
the Green Bay Packers, on a drive that led to San Francisco's
game-winning touchdown; and in a final indignity for the Bills,
receiver Andre Reed was called for unsportsmanlike conduct and
ejected for bumping an official after he was not awarded a
touchdown on a pass play, even though he appeared to be over the
goal line. The call forced the Bills to settle for a field goal
when they trailed Miami by 10 points, in a game they eventually
lost, 24-17.

LEWIS WIDOW'S SUIT SETS $100M VALUE ON POSSIBLE EARNINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHEN KURKJIAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Lawyers for the widow of the late Boston Celtics star
Reggie Lewis will argue in their upcoming malpractice suit that
despite his heart condition Lewis might have been able to continue
playing basketball had he received proper medical treatment from
Dr. Gilbert H. Mudge Jr., his lead cardiologist.
</P>
<P>
   In documents provided to Mudge's lawyers this week, attorneys
Robert G. Harley and Bridget Asaro contended that had Lewis not
suffered a fatal heart attack at age 27 he could have earned a
maximum of more than $100 million from a variety of positions
during his life, including as a player, coach, broadcaster, and
from endorsements.
</P>
<P>
   Although Lewis's heart was found to be badly scarred, Harley
said Wednesday that he will argue that Lewis might have been able
to keep playing by taking heart medication or by wearing a
defibrillator. Harley said Wednesday that he knows of at least one
college football player with a heart condition who competes while
wearing a defibrillator, and a professional basketball player who
is able to play by taking a heart medication.
</P>
<P>
   If Lewis's heart condition precluded him from returning as a
basketball player, he probably would have followed the path of
other captains of Celtics teams and become an NBA coach and then a
broadcaster, the lawyers said. Combined with endorsements and other
paid appearances, he would have earned a minimum of $40 million
even without playing another professional game, the lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   The setting of Lewis's earning potential at between $40 million
and more than $100 million is the first time that Donna
Harris-Lewis and her lawyers have hinted at the amount they are
seeking to recover if they can prove Lewis's death was a result of
negligence by Mudge.
</P>
<P>
   The trial is scheduled to begin April 26 in Suffolk Superior
Court, three days short of the sixth anniversary of Lewis's
collapse during a Celtics playoff game at Boston Garden.
</P>
<P>
   While a team of the city's top cardiologists concluded within
days that Lewis probably had a life-threatening heart condition, he
spurned their advice and instead went to Mudge and Brigham and
Women's Hospital in Boston for treatment. After 10 days of testing,
Mudge and his team concluded that there were no problems with
Lewis's heart, and that his collapse was caused by a neurological
condition that caused him at times to feel faint during workouts.
Lewis died three months later while shooting baskets at the
Brandeis University gym in Waltham.
</P>
<P>
   Mudge's lead attorney, William J. Dailey Jr., of the firm Sloane
&AMP; Walsh, did not respond to questions Wednesday. In previously
filed documents, Mudge has contended that he provided a more
pessimistic view of Lewis's heart condition to the couple privately
than he had publicly, particularly after receiving the results of
tests done on Lewis by a third group of doctors a month before his
death.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Mudge's lawyers are seeking to show that the scarring to
Lewis's heart was caused by cocaine use, a charge that has been
strenuously denied by Harris-Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Although she has repeatedly denied requests for an interview,
Harris-Lewis released a statement Wednesday saying that she has not
decided what she might do with any money won from the lawsuit. ``I
am still searching my heart and soul for the proper way to capture
Reggie's unique spirit, and the legacy he would want to leave
(their children) Reggie Jr. and Reggiena, and to the community.''
</P>
<P>
   She also responded to some public criticism that she was not
satisfied with the $14 million she received from life insurance
benefits taken out on Lewis's contract and had filed suit against
Mudge to win more money. ``This case has never been about money or
about what killed Reggie. This case is about what could have saved
his life. It's Reggie's life that was most important, not his
death,'' said Harris-Lewis's statement.
</P>
<P>
   And in a veiled reference to reports that Lewis used cocaine
while a standout basketball player at Northeastern University,
Harris-Lewis said: ``My hope is that the conclusion of this case
will finally allow Reggie to rest in peace by restoring his
reputation for our children, our family and friends, and his
fans.''

CMGI CHIEF TO DELAY EFFORT TO BLOCK DEAL FOR LYCOS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The chief executive of the largest investor in Lycos Inc. said
Wednesday that his firm might wait several months before launching
a counterbid for control of the Waltham, Mass. Internet company, in
part to deny possible stock benefits to USA Networks Inc. and
thwart its takeover bid.
</P>
<P>
   David Wetherell, head of Andover, Mass. Internet venture captial
firm CMGI Inc., said his company is still trying to arrange a rival
bid for Lycos. But he added he might wait for other dissastified
Lycos shareholders to turn down the pending offer from USA Networks
before launching any counterbid.
</P>
<P>
   Such a strategy could spare Lycos from having to issue stock
obligations that could be worth as much as $176 million to USA
Networks, the New York media firm controlled by Barry Diller.
</P>
<P>
   But such a move would also add to the uncertainty faced by Lycos
investors as they decide whether to approve a deal announced Feb. 9
to combine their company with elements of USA Networks. A
shareholder meeting to vote on the agreement is not expected for
several months.
</P>
<P>
   CMGI, which holds about 18.5 percent of Lycos shares, believes
that a majority of the company's investors would join CMGI in
rejecting the deal under its present terms.
</P>
<P>
   In making his bid for Lycos, Diller obtained a pledge that USA
Networks and its affiliates would have the right to purchase as
much as 19.9 percent of Lycos stock at $127.14 per share if the
company were sold to another bidder at that price or more. Lycos
stock reached that level the day before the USA Networks bid was
announced.
</P>
<P>
   Wetherell has said that at least four other parties have
expressed interest in topping USA Network's bid but has not
identified them or given any indication of how much they would be
willing to pay for Lycos.
</P>
<P>
   In an exchange of e-mails Wednesday, Wetherell also said that
CMGI might wait until after a shareholders' vote on USA Network's
bid before announcing any other offers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting the (Lycos-USA Networks) deal voted down first, thus
avoiding tripping the topping fee options, and making an offer at
that time'' is one approach under consideration, Wetherell wrote.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for USA Networks could not be reached for comment.
A Lycos executives declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Wetherell resigned from the Lycos board of directors last week
and vowed to find a better for deal for Lycos, whose shares sank
after the deal with USA Networks was announced. They recovered
after Wetherell's actions, which were unusual because he had
originally backed the deal as a board member.
</P>
<P>
   Wetherell's actions have also put Lycos executives in an awkward
position, because a pending deadline for certain securities filings
prevents them from responding publicly. Lycos executives say only
that the company remains committed to the terms of its agreement.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Wetherell's campaign has also helped bolster
Lycos shares, which had traded as low as 83 7/8 after the deal was
announced. Wednesday they closed at $101 3/4, down 3 1/4 in Nasdaq
trading.
</P>
<P>
   Sources familiar with the terms of the agreement note that it
prevents Diller's USA Networks from earning more than $176 million
from the options, a small fraction of Lycos' total market
capitalization. Given Wednesday's closing price, the company's
total valuation was about $4.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in CMGI fell 5 3/8 to close at $175 3/8. CMGI said
Wednesday that its board of directors has approved a two-for-one
split of its common shares to holders of record on May 13, pending
shareholder approvals.

paid appearances, he would have earned a minimum of $40 million
even without playing another professional game, the lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   The setting of Lewis's earning potential at between $40 million
and more than $100 million is the first time that Donna
Harris-Lewis and her lawyers have hinted at the amount they are
seeking to recover if they can prove Lewis's death was a result of
negligence by Mudge.
</P>
<P>
   The trial is scheduled to begin April 26 in Suffolk Superior
Court, three days short of the sixth anniversary of Lewis's
collapse during a Celtics playoff game at Boston Garden.
</P>
<P>
   While a team of the city's top cardiologists concluded within
days that Lewis probably had a life-threatening heart condition, he
spurned their advice and instead went to Mudge and Brigham and
Women's Hospital in Boston for treatment. After 10 days of testing,
Mudge and his team concluded that there were no problems with
Lewis's heart, and that his collapse was caused by a neurological
condition that caused him at times to feel faint during workouts.
Lewis died three months later while shooting baskets at the
Brandeis University gym in Waltham.
</P>
<P>
   Mudge's lead attorney, William J. Dailey Jr., of the firm Sloane
&AMP; Walsh, did not respond to questions Wednesday. In previously
filed documents, Mudge has contended that he provided a more
pessimistic view of Lewis's heart condition to the couple privately
than he had publicly, particularly after receiving the results of
tests done on Lewis by a third group of doctors a month before his
death.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Mudge's lawyers are seeking to show that the scarring to
Lewis's heart was caused by cocaine use, a charge that has been
strenuously denied by Harris-Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Although she has repeatedly denied requests for an interview,
Harris-Lewis released a statement Wednesday saying that she has not
decided what she might do with any money won from the lawsuit. ``I
am still searching my heart and soul for the proper way to capture
Reggie's unique spirit, and the legacy he would want to leave
(their children) Reggie Jr. and Reggiena, and to the community.''
</P>
<P>
   She also responded to some public criticism that she was not
satisfied with the $14 million she received from life insurance
benefits taken out on Lewis's contract and had filed suit against
Mudge to win more money. ``This case has never been about money or
about what killed Reggie. This case is about what could have saved
his life. It's Reggie's life that was most important, not his
death,'' said Harris-Lewis's statement.
</P>
<P>
   And in a veiled reference to reports that Lewis used cocaine
while a standout basketball player at Northeastern University,
Harris-Lewis said: ``My hope is that the conclusion of this case
will finally allow Reggie to rest in peace by restoring his
reputation for our children, our family and friends, and his
fans.''

MAN-MADE BARRIERS ALTER SALMON'S SHORELINE HABITAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB TAYLOR  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Sea walls, bulkheads and other man-made barriers have
transformed more than half of the central Puget Sound coastline,
starving beaches of sand and salmon of food and shelter.
</P>
<P>
   State and federal officials are moving to protect these areas,
but they are running into resistance from landowners and local
agencies, turning shorelines into a new environmental battlefield.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing new about the problem. Homeowners and
industries have built walls against waterfront erosion for decades.
Few people noticed. Until recently, few cared.
</P>
<P>
   But a recent survey found that man has reshaped an extraordinary
52 percent of the central Puget Sound coastline.
</P>
<P>
   The damage has gradually accumulated, scientists say. In many
places, sandy beaches have eroded away to cobble or hardpan, wiping
out spawning areas for small fish and beds for grasses that nurture
marine life.
</P>
<P>
   Part of what makes the problem difficult to attack, biologists
say, is that any single wall does little harm.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the proverbial death by a thousand cuts,'' said Dan
Pentilla, a biologist for the Washington Department of Fish and
Wildlife. ``If bulkheading isn't controlled or new material added,
the beaches on Puget Sound are going to coarsen and disappear.''
</P>
<P>
   To scientists, beaches aren't the stable features that appear to
the casual beach-walker. They are rivers of sand. They ebb and flow
at the prodding of waves, currents and tides.
</P>
<P>
   Bulkheads and seawalls are retaining walls built a short
distance from shore to slow natural erosion of banks into water by
reducing wave action on the beach. In doing so, bulkheads can dam
the headwaters of these granular streams, with effects that can
stretch for miles. By reflecting wave energy, they also can
accelerate how fast sand is washed away.
</P>
<P>
   This week, protection of beaches was elevated by the
long-heralded listing of Puget Sound chinook salmon as threatened
under the Endangered Species Act. The local chinook is one of
several fish that suffer from shoreline armoring.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials are writing rules that will prohibit people
from doing anything that significantly harms the fish or its
habitat unless specifically exempted. That means tighter
restrictions loom over bulkhead-building.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to protect near-shore habitat, and maybe avoid
draconian restrictions, a state commission on shoreline guidelines
proposes to make bulkhead-building a last resort. The panel,
representing government agencies and business, environmental and
recreational groups, aims to make homeowners prove that proposed
bulkheads are needed to protect their homes from imminent danger,
and that a ``softer'' solution, such as adding gravel to the beach
or planting on a bluff, will not work.
</P>
<P>
   But the proposal faces an uncertain future. Society's interest
in saving fish and beaches collides at the shoreline with
homeowners' determination to safeguard even small pieces of
waterfront land.
</P>
<P>
   Bulkheads are buttressed by forces of economics and property
rights almost as irresistible as Puget Sound's tides. The real
estate market rewards their construction by boosting the value of
land that is protected. And when conflicts with regulators have
arisen, courts and the Legislature have generally backed
landowners' wall-building.
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen whether the Endangered Species Act, once
termed the hydrogen bomb of environmental laws, will shift the
balance toward conservation.
</P>
<P>
   There is little doubt that coarsening beaches by reducing them
to hardpan and gravel affects salmon. When small fish like sand
lance and surf smelt lose spawning areas, their decline deprives
young salmon of food. Sand loss also can eliminate footing for
eelgrass, which provides both food and shelter for to salmon in
what is, for some, a crucial stage of development.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the most heavily affected salmon are so-called
``ocean-type'' chinook, which leave streams early to spend as long
as two months in shallow Puget Sound waters, according to Charles
Simenstad of the University of Washington School of Fisheries.
There, in a process he calls ``puberty times 10,'' they adjust to
saltwater and pack on the size and strength they need to evade
predators at sea.
</P>
<P>
   Other types of salmon do not use the shallows as much, so why
not write off the ocean-type chinook? Biologists say the region's
depleted chinook family cannot afford to lose an important branch.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon rely on diverse life cycles to avoid extinction, somewhat
as investors rely on diverse stock portfolios to reduce risk of
financial collapse. Chinook salmon are the masters of diversity,
with some racing to sea, others lingering in streams and still more
hanging around Puget Sound. The payoff in the evolutionary lottery
is clear: If conditions for one type of chinook collapse, others
can carry on the species.
</P>
<P>
   That calculation has focused official attention on Puget Sound
beaches and near-shore shallows. Most of the region's attention has
focused on streams, so some officials are warning that degrading
near-shore areas risk becoming ``the neglected link'' for salmon
between rivers and the sea.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we focus solely on the streams and don't focus on the
near-shore, we aren't going to be successful'' restoring Puget
Sound chinook, says Chuck Clarke, regional administrator of the
Environmental Protection Agency.
</P>
<P>
   State officials hope to upgrade habitat protection by rewriting
state shoreline guidelines, which prod counties to meet minimum
standards for protection. Biologists say the 20-year-old guidelines
are badly outdated.
</P>
<P>
   But some businesses and property owners are resisting change.
Three attempts to upgrade guidelines have run aground, and dissent
continues. The Association of Washington Business boycotted the
current guidelines commission and calls its recommendation
premature.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Terich, a professor of geography at Western Washington
University in Bellingham, empathizes with the opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a difficult situation,'' he says. ``I can understand the
plight of people who paid a lot for their property and want to
preserve it, but in doing so they're creating a lot of problems for
the preservation of beaches.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, no one expects to tear out bulkheads, so the guidelines
will have little impact on the well-hardened shores of urban areas
like Seattle and Tacoma. Mostly, the commission hopes new rules
will slow the spread of walls across still-developing shorelines,
such as those of rural Pierce and Kitsap counties.
</P>
<P>
   The front-line troops defending these shorelines are habitat
biologists for the state Department of Fish and Wildlife. They
issue permits for docks and bulkheads.
</P>
<P>
   Still, their authority is limited. The Legislature has directed
them to expedite permits for bulkheads in front of single family
homes. While biologists may encourage less-damaging bulkhead
designs, they say they generally lack authority to deny them.
</P>
<P>
   City and county development agencies exercise the most control
over bulkhead and retaining-wall construction. Wall-builders must
get permits from these agencies whether the project is above or
below high water.
</P>
<P>
   County attitudes about shoreline protection vary widely. Whatcom
and Thurston counties have cracked down on building bulkheads and
retaining walls.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think they're necessary and they're somewhat
destructive to the environment,'' said Roger Giebelhaus, an
environmental planner in Thurston County's development office.
</P>
<P>
   Some other counties and cities have shrugged off biologists'
attempts to slow bulkhead-building. Ordinances in many places ``are
not strong enough to prevent damage to near-shore habitat,'' says
state researcher Ginny Broadhurst.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Brennan, a state habitat biologist, goes further. In Kitsap
County, he complained, ``we're allowing people to build anywhere
they want with no analysis.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in King County, generally one of the most progressive in
enforcing environmental laws, shoreline administrators have butted
heads with state biologists.
</P>
<P>
   The county's Department of Development and Environmental
Services routinely waives environmental review for homeowner
proposals to build replacement bulkheads and docks, which can shade
out eelgrass and harbor fish that prey on salmon.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, state biologists objected, noting that the
replacements often went far beyond the original structure. One
40-foot dock, for instance, was ``replaced'' by an 80-foot dock
without environmental review.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Carey, director of land use for the county department, said
he was ``infuriated'' by the second-guessing from the state, which
he rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Even though King County ordered all agencies to re-examine
procedures that could affect salmon, Carey's agency stuck by its
practice. State habitat biologist John Boettner says he once
mentioned to county officials that chinook would soon be listed as
threatened, but got brushed off.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said it wasn't listed yet,'' Boettner said.
</P>
<P>
   But as the county felt the hot breath of this week's listing, it
called for all county agencies, including Carey's, to impose
tighter environmental reviews.

   NEW YORK _ Everything but the cloudless sky was green Wednesday,
as record numbers packed St. Patrick's Cathedral, marched up Fifth
Avenue in the 238th annual St. Patrick's Day parade and lined the
2{-mile route to hoot and holler in support.
</P>
<P>
   The sky, of course, was a parade-perfect powder blue, as the
snowstorm of a few days ago became a distant memory and the mercury
in Central Park hit a springlike 64 degrees. The sun shone down on
green-painted faces and green-dyed flattops, green-tinted
sunglasses, green shoelaces and a haberdasher's smorgasbord of
green hats, from plastic bowlers to felt Dr. Seuss specials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've marched in snow, and we've had some rainy days, soaked
to the skin,'' said Michael McCormack, 60, the national historian
for the Ancient Order of Hibernians, who has been in 39 of the past
42 parades. ``There's no feeling in the world like coming out of
one of those canyons onto the avenue: the sun hits your face, the
people cheer you. You can see the people actually grow taller.''
</P>
<P>
   The parade was relatively peaceful, although three young men
were arrested in two separate incidents of assault. In addition, 17
gay and lesbian demonstrators, protesting their exclusion in a
pre-parade event that has become an annual ritual, were arrested on
disorderly conduct charges.
</P>
<P>
   The incidents did not mar the smiling Irish eyes in the crowd _
of 2 million, according to organizers, 275,000 according to the
police _ who lined up a dozen deep along both sides of Fifth Avenue
to cheer some 200,000 people, led by the actress Maureen O'Hara,
the grand marshall, from 44th street to 86th street.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Gov. George Pataki, marching
separately, received rock-star receptions along the route, with
several suggestions shouted out for each man's political future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go Senator!'' one man yelled to Giuliani, who is considering a
bid for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``President, run for president!'' someone urged Pataki, who wore
a fisherman-knit sweater with a shamrock insignia sewn onto the
chest.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor and Cardinal John O'Connor declared this year's the
best parade ever. In his homily at morning Mass, which drew 4,000
people to the cathedral, O'Connor urged the Irish to avoid
prejudice against others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our forefathers, our foremothers, came from some other
country,'' he said later, as he received a bouquet from a New
Jersey high school drum major outside the cathedral. ``It is
imperative that Irish, above all, remember their roots.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, the question of relations between the police
and the community, which has dominated public debate in the six
weeks since four white officers fatally shot an unarmed West
African immigrant in the Bronx, bubbled near the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Support for Giuliani and the Police Department was overwhelming,
though the crowd was largely from out of town: ``Burn in Hell Al
Sharpton and Company, Police Officers are the Greatest,'' read an
eight-foot sign carried by Gene Roos, a drywall contractor from
Patchogue, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   But most remained oblivious to the politics as they enjoyed the
lively bagpipe music and row after row of marchers, some of the men
and women in uniform and some in skirts.
</P>
<P>
   Three women from Long Island, of Italian descent but merrily
clad in two-foot-tall hats decorated with shamrocks, wondered at
the age-old question of whether men wore underwear under their
kilts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw on line, there was a picture of a guy in a kilt,'' piped
in Danielle Lichaa, 17, a student from Staten Island who was
perched on a nearby (very dark green) mailbox. ``He definitely
didn't have underwear on.''

NFL TO REPLAY REPLAY _ FOR A YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ For an instant at least, the NFL will have instant
replay.
</P>
<P>
   A one-year experiment with a replay challenge system was
approved Wednesday by the widest margin in its often stormy history
at the final day of the NFL's annual league meeting, bringing
electronic refereeing back to the NFL for the first time since
1991.
</P>
<P>
   The newly installed system allows for up to two challenges per
team per game plus additional challenges in the final two minutes
of each half and throughout overtime at the descretion of a replay
assistant working in a replay booth near the press box.
</P>
<P>
   During the 56 minutes the coaches are free to make the decision
they will face losing a timeout if their challenge is not upheld by
the referee on the field. When the replay assistant is in charge of
signalling the referee of the need for a review no timeouts would
be effected.
</P>
<P>
   It was that shifting of the responsibility for making the replay
request away from the coaches when a game is at its most critical
that swayed several teams to vote for the proposal, which passed
28-3. That far exceeds any previous votes dating back to the first
replay proposal in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Replay was first approved in 1986 and was used for six seasons
before it was voted out in 1992 by a 17-11 margin. It failed in
both 1997 and 1998 by slight margins but a series of questionable
calls in late season games that appeared to be proven wrong by
television cameras last season swayed several teams, including the
Buffalo Bills who had traditionally opposed it, to change their
vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a few high profile calls that people felt could
have been turned around (with replay),'' Tampa Bay coach Tony Dungy
said. ``My thought is those things even out but a couple of teams
got burned in key games and it changed some votes.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the new system, the referee on the field will review the
plays on a field-level monitor and must make a decision within 90
seconds of the replay first rolling. A decision will be reversed
only when there is ``indisputable visual evidence'' that warrants a
change.
</P>
<P>
   Limiting the review time to 90 seconds was to avoid slowing down
the flow of the game and to make it clear the error was an obvious
one.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it takes more than 90 seconds, it's not irrefutible,'' said
Seattle Seahawks' head coach Mike Holmgren, who co-chairs the
competition committee with Tampa's Rich McKay. ``This is a system
to correct major, major errors, human errors, game-changing
errors.''
</P>
<P>
   The only reviewable plays will be:
</P>
<P>
   --Those governed by the sideline, goal line, end zone or end
line.
</P>
<P>
   --A pass ruled complete, incomplete or intercepted in the field
of play.
</P>
<P>
   --Touching of a forward pass by an ineligible receiver or a
defensive player.
</P>
<P>
   --Whether a quarterback has fumbled or was throwing a forward
pass.
</P>
<P>
   --Illegal forward pass when passer goes beyond the line of
scrimmage or after a change of possession.
</P>
<P>
   --A forward or backward pass thrown from behind the line of
scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   --Runner down by contact.
</P>
<P>
   --Forward progress with respect to first downs.
</P>
<P>
   --Touching of a kick.
</P>
<P>
   --Number of players on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't to correct every play,'' said McKay, who voted
against replay last year. ``What changed my opinion was the media,
the fans, the players and the coaches all wanted some replay
system.''
</P>
<P>
   Oakland Raiders' owner Al Davis had also voted against the
return of replay the past two years but changed his mind this time
despite still being opposed to the challenge system that ties
replay requests to potentially lost timeouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want replay but I don't like the challenge system,'' Davis
said. ``But this was the quickest way to get replay back and try
the technology. We can get the challenge out after we try the
technology.''
</P>
<P>
   In the six-year history of replay, from 1986-1991, 2,967 plays
were reviewed with only 376 overturned but both numbers increased
nearly every season. The first year, only 38 of the 374 calls
reviewed were reversed. By 1991, 90 of 570 reviewed calls were
reversed.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One other rule change was to outlaw the chop block from behind
below the waist along the line of scrimmage. This has long been a
bane of defensive linemen's existence, resulting in more than a few
knee injuries and many hot tempers. In addition, ``if an offensive
player's block is followed by the blocker rolling up on the back of
the defender, it is illegal and will be called unnecessary
roughness . . . The league announced its preseason nationally
televised games and the Patriots are involved in one. Their Aug. 21
game at home against Dallas will be televised nationally at 8 p.m.
on ESPN . . . The request for approval of Howard Milstein and
Daniel Snyder's $800 million offer to buy the Washington Redskins
was tabled for another 60 days. The league contends Milstein is not
putting up enough of his own money to buy the team from a trust set
up by late owner Jack Kent Cooke. In addition, some owners would
like to see Cooke's son, John Kent Cooke, retain the team. The
younger Cooke bid $700 million . . . The NFL announced it would not
play the 2003 Super Bowl in San Francisco because their new stadium
plans have gone awary. No alternate location was announced but San
Diego may have the inside track . . . New Orleans head coach
shocked media members when he said Wednesday he would be willing to
trade the Saints' entiree draft to land Heisman Trophy winner Ricky
Williams. Ditka, whose Saints draft No. 12, was ready to make the
offer to both Cleveland and Philadelphia, which hold the first two
selections. Cleveland head coach Chris Palmer said he had little
interest in that and personnel director Dwight Clark reiterated
that point. Saints president Bill Kuharich admitted ``it would take
much more than that'' to get into one of the first two drafting
slots. ``We're not interested in the No. 1 pick,'' Kuharich said.
``We're interested in Ricky Williams.'' . . . The Jets have told
quarterback Glenn Foley he is free to try and make a trade for
himself with another NFL team. If he does, it would be pending the
Jets' approval.

EXPERTS WARY OF NEW YORK PLAN TO USE TOBACCO MONEY TO BACK BONDS
</HEADLINE>
   (wg) 
 By LESLIE EATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ New York City is likely to become the first
government in the country to raise money based on future payments
it will receive from the $206 billion tobacco settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Not only has the city already set up a special agency to sell
``tobacco bonds,'' but it has also hired three Wall Street firms to
help it with the bond deal, which could be arranged as early as
July.
</P>
<P>
   City officials estimate that they could borrow $2.5 billion over
the next four years; the bonds would be repaid from the $6.7
billion the city expects to get from the tobacco settlement fund by
2025.
</P>
<P>
   But financial experts are warning the city and other local and
state governments around the country not to count their deals
before they are completed.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement, which 46 state governments reached last year
with the country's largest tobacco companies, is highly complex and
somewhat conditional, financial analysts said. Most of the states
are planning to share the proceeds with local governments, but the
amount that any government receives could be reduced by several
factors including the federal government's effort to claim some of
the money, and the smokers' success in giving up their nicotine
habits.
</P>
<P>
   By selling bonds backed by tobacco settlement money, the
governments hope to get a big sum all at once rather than having
the money trickle in over 25 years. Those governments, including
Maine, Texas and Washington, D.C., could then use the bond proceeds
for buildings, roads, bridges, and other capital projects.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, analysts are wary. ``There are still a lot of
things that have to happen, in our opinion, before bonds could be
secured'' by money from the tobacco settlement, said Steven J.
Murphy, managing director for public finance at Standard &AMP; Poor's
Ratings Services, which analyzes bond issues. The firm has just
issued a report calling on governments to adopt ``a cautionary
approach'' to using the tobacco money.
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts are even more cautious. ``Because of the
uncertainty of future years' payments, the revenue should not be
viewed as a long-term, stable source of security for bonds,'' wrote
Kevin D. Taylor of Prudential Securities in a research report for
possible clients, ``Payment Uncertainties Are Built Into Tobacco
Settlement Agreement.''

<P>
   City officials say they are well aware of the potential
problems. ``This is not a done deal, because some issues must still
be resolved,'' said Comptroller Alan Hevesi, who would supervise
bond sales along with Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. But the city decided
it would be prudent to prepare for the bond sale, Hevesi said, so
it can move quickly once some of the questions are answered.
</P>
<P>
   Under the tobacco agreement, New York State is likely to get at
least $25 billion over the life of the deal, and has agreed to
split the money with cities and counties. Gov. George Pataki has
proposed giving the city $6.7 billion. But New York City and
Westchester and Erie counties think they should get more, and have
filed an appeal with the Appellate Division of state Supreme Court.
Such an appeal could delay distribution of the money, analysts
said.
</P>
<P>
   A larger problem, for all state and local governments, is that
the federal government is threatening to claim some of the money,
which would reduce the amount available to everyone else. The
administration is more likely to claim a state's tobacco funds if
they are not used for health and education purposes, said Murphy,
of Standard &AMP; Poor's.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, Giuliani has said he plans to use the money
primarily for school construction, although the bond proceeds will
go into the capital budget and could be used for any major project,
city officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature could decide to change the formula that Pataki
has set for who gets the state money and how it will be spent; in
any case, the Legislature must also pass a bill that would make the
settlement binding on all companies that sell tobacco in the state.
</P>
<P>
   The signing companies _ Philip Morris, R.J. Reynolds, Brown &AMP;
Williamson and Lorillard Tobacco _ control almost all tobacco sales
in the state, but the new law would be important if any of them
said financial problems kept them from making the payments, or
other companies took over their share of the market.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the settlement payments are backed by just four
companies is a concern to analysts at Moody's Investors Service,
another bond ratings agency. ``The problem is that anything that is
likely to tank one is likely to impact all of the companies,'' said
Michael Knef, a vice president and senior analyst.  &QL;

 &HT;    Southern folk artist Lonnie Holley at a crossroads
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Jim Auchmutey
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARPERSVILLE, Ala. _ A dozen vehicles squat in the yard, but
none of them work. There are bedpans and televisions, and piles of
plywood and stands of Styrofoam, and nylon mesh flapping in the
breeze and cats brushing between the rusty legs of discarded lawn
chairs. If you didn't know this was a folk art environment, you'd
swear it was a trailer park after a tornado.
</P>
<P>
   But the white-columned home in the middle of the property is no
doublewide; it's two stories, six bedrooms, 2 1/2 baths. Inside the
garage, at the end of a passageway constricted like a cave with
more stuff, the man of the house is pounding an electric keyboard,
growling a sort of blues: ``Sittin' in a cotton field ... down here
in Harpersville ... thinking about America ... livin' in the last
days.''
</P>
<P>
   Lonnie Holley looks up, his eyes as wide and bright as a
7-year-old's, and extends a hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never take anything to the junkyard,'' he says, gesturing at
the clutter that threatens to engulf him.
</P>
<P>
   You notice a battered wooden sign in the corner: ``Hi Kids _ the
Sandman.'' Holley, one of the most important figures in Southern
folk art, started his career 20 years ago by carving the soft
sandstone that steel mills use as molds. Since then, he's led so
many workshops at schools and churches that children around
Birmingham know him as the Sandman.
</P>
<P>
   He wonders what the children would think now.
</P>
<P>
   It was a rainy Tuesday afternoon in December. Holley had just
returned from an errand in town and was unwinding in his bedroom
when he heard a commotion downstairs. He hurried down the steps.
Voices were shouting. ``Get down!'' It was the police. ``Get down
now!'' They ordered him to the floor, face down on the living room
carpet, and clamped handcuffs around his wrists.
</P>
<P>
   On a wall above them, a framed picture showed Holley decked out
in a black suit, grinning with unabashed pride as he shook hands
with Hillary Clinton. Four years before, a sculpture of his had
been part of an exhibition at the White House. The first lady
called him a ``master artist.'' It was one of the highlights of his
career, of his life, which is why he decorated the photo with faux
flowers and hung it in a place of honor on a wall facing the front
entrance _ the first thing sheriff's deputies would have seen when
they kicked in his door with a search warrant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this some kind of a joke?'' Holley asked them.
</P>
<P>
   It was no joke. He was under arrest.
</P>
<P>
   __
</P>
<P>
   Lonnie Holley has known a world of trouble in his 49 years. He
has been beaten, shot, jailed. He has been abandoned, cheated,
stolen from. He has watched as his home of 18 years _ along with
much of the art and debris he carefully placed around it _ was
bulldozed into a trench to make way for an airport expansion. But
nothing in a life of Job-like tribulations has prepared him for the
misfortunes of the past few months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like somebody's been holding a black candle over me,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   Holley is credited with creating some of the most sophisticated,
conceptual work in Southern folk art, an increasingly popular field
that has won international acclaim in recent years. Museums and
galleries from New York to Japan have displayed his paintings,
sandstone carvings and assemblages, the symbolic sculptures he
crafts from things other people have thrown out. His vision burned
brightly during the 1996 Olympics, when a re-creation of his
art-bedazzled yard formed the focal point of ``Souls Grown Deep,''
a major folk art exhibition at City Hall East in Atlanta. Newsweek
magazine judged it the best part of the Olympic Arts Festival.
</P>
<P>
   Given the praise and publicity, this should be the best of times
for Holley. Instead, he finds himself spending more time talking to
lawyers and judges than making art.
</P>
<P>
   First he was uprooted from his Birmingham home in a tortuous
condemnation proceeding that dragged on for five years. Then, after
he moved to the small town of Harpersville, 25 miles away, his new
neighbors feuded with his family, one of them going so far as to
assault him, police say. Finally, on Dec. 8, he and his three sons
_ Ezekial, Kubra and A.J. _ were arrested in connection with a
burglary and arson at a golf course behind their house. The Holleys
face multiple charges that could bring the father and his oldest
son prison time _ although Holley says he had nothing to do with
the incident.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that his boys' actions landed him in jail is especially
hurtful. Holley is raising five children and two grandchildren more
or less by himself. He has taught them to pray, to say ``ma'am''
and ``sir'' to their elders, to cultivate their imaginations and
elevate their spirits by creating art. And now they get him
arrested.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, Holley is broke. With his spotty income
and a large family to support, he has always lived on poverty's
front porch. Art collectors who visited his old place in Birmingham
were never surprised when he asked for a little cash on top of
their checks for his work. He often needed the money for dinner.
Now he has an additional bill to worry about: bail.
</P>
<P>
   It's a familiar story in the world of folk art. Howard Finster,
the Georgia preacher who has made a bundle selling angels and
Elvises, is a shining exception. Many of his peers live in
primitive conditions, scrambling from weekend to weekend when the
yuppies show up with their checkbooks and cameras. The reasons for
their struggle are more complicated than they might seem. Whatever
the causes, the result is dispiriting: Renowned, respected artists
like Holley wouldn't qualify for an auto loan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought we were the hit of the South,'' says Charlie Lucas,
a Prattville, Ala., sculptor and friend of Holley's. ``Now it looks
like we were the ones getting hit.''
</P>
<P>
   For Holley, the blows started early.
</P>
<P>
   __
</P>
<P>
   The artist ambles out to his driveway, where chunks of sandstone
sit amid the general rubble. He's tall and thin, wearing dusty work
clothes of black and blue, with a scraggly goatee and a crown of
dreadlocks that springs from his head like a clump of fantastic
weeds. He speaks in silver streams of thought that can leap like an
evangelist's altar call or flow like a jazzman's saxophone solo. As
he begins to tell about his hard life and times _ a folklore saga
in itself _ he picks up a broken-off hacksaw blade, crouches over a
block of stone and begins to work it with fingers that are as long
and supple as a guitarist's.
</P>
<P>
   He was born poor in 1950 to a Birmingham woman who gave him to
another woman, who then ran off with him. That woman traded him to
another for a pint of whiskey. And that woman died and left him
with her husband, a man he knew as Big Daddy, who was so mean that
Lonnie took to running away, one time jumping a train and riding
all the way to New Orleans. He was sent to reform school, and he
ran away from there, too, but they always caught him and sent him
back and beat him for having run.
</P>
<P>
   Holley tells the story in a mesmerizing monotone that's much
gentler than his singing voice. As he gouges and shaves the
sandstone, a woman's face begins to take shape.
</P>
<P>
   He was released from reform school as a teen-ager and went back
to Birmingham to live with his grandmother. She showed him how to
scavenge at the dump. Taught him about recycling. A good woman.
Then he left for Florida, where he had a brother and sister _ two
of the 27 ``live babies'' he says his mother had _ and he supported
himself as a cook. Worked at Disney World. Made him dress up like
Goofy one time, when Goofy didn't show.
</P>
<P>
   Holley laughs and bares a snaggle-toothed smile that's a bit,
well, goofy. The sandstone has two faces.
</P>
<P>
   And then he came back to Alabama to help his mother with all
those children. And he was drinking too much and depressed, and one
time, after he was robbed, he took a fistful of sleeping pills, but
lived. Then a favorite niece and nephew died in a house fire, and
no one could afford tombstones, so he carved them himself from
discarded sandstone. He'd never done anything like that before. It
made him feel better to create something so beautiful when he was
in such despair. So he carved some more, and people told him he
wasn't a bum, he was an artist. And he called the Birmingham Museum
of Art and made an appointment and showed the curators some of his
carvings, and they thought he was so good that they got him
included in a show at the Smithsonian Institution.
</P>
<P>
   The fingers are flying. The sandstone has three faces.
</P>
<P>
   And he met a woman and started a family and fashioned a home out
of a hovel overlooking the Birmingham airport. And he remembered
his grandmother in the city dump and hauled stuff home to make
found-object sculptures _ visual allegories in which every piece of
trash found new meaning. A skillet might mean motherhood. Barbed
wire might mean injustice. And people started driving miles to see
his yard, which was spooky and beautiful like a jungle. Most of
them wanted to watch him work and buy pieces, but some of them took
without paying or paying enough. So he put mirrors on the trees to
ward off evil spirits. But it must not have worked, or he wouldn't
be sitting here singing about the last days in a cotton field in
Harpersville.
</P>
<P>
   Four faces, full lipped and broad nosed, look out from the
sandstone. Holley looks back tenderly, like a new father.
</P>
<P>
   __
</P>
<P>
   Holley first heard he was going to have to move in 1992.
Birmingham International Airport wanted to extend a runway and was
required to expand the no man's land beyond the end of the tarmac.
The project would require buying and demolishing hundreds of homes
in the predominantly black, low-income neighborhood of Airport
Hills.
</P>
<P>
   The airport authority offered Holley $14,000 for his acre of
land. But his acre was nothing like the others. While his house was
crude _ a dank, rambling shed with earth floors and rudimentary
wiring and plumbing _ his yard contained thousands of pieces of art
that seemed to be as rooted in the soil as the trees. Sometimes
they had been there so long that trees dropped seeds in them and
they literally took root. The work was potentially worth far more
than the offer, which he turned down.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, the surrounding homes vanished as his neighbors
accepted resettlement checks. Friends took Holley out to look at
other houses in Alabama and west Georgia, but his heart wasn't in
it.
</P>
<P>
   Gail Trechsel, director of the Birmingham Museum of Art,
remembers driving him around. ``Nothing was ever quite right. I
decided it was a waste of time because he really didn't want to
leave.''
</P>
<P>
   And the bulldozers crept closer.
</P>
<P>
   Holley almost left once. Keeping his home, he rented a house in
the nearby Woodlawn neighborhood and opened a studio. But when he
carted in some junk and started making assemblages in the yard,
residents complained and he was repeatedly cited by the sanitation
department. His landlord evicted him.
</P>
<P>
   ``She wanted me to live behind a white picket fence,'' Holley
says, chuckling at the very thought.
</P>
<P>
   So it was back to the old place. The bleak atmosphere seemed to
invite thieves. They took his materials for scrap. They helped
themselves to his art. They stole five of his vehicles, which he
had packed with hundreds of paintings in anticipation of the move.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd get these calls,'' says Monty Stabler, a Birmingham art
dealer, who was suspicious of some the inquiries she was fielding
from people who wanted to sell Holley's work. They always seemed to
lose interest when they were asked where a piece came from.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was one house _ Holley's _ surrounded by a
moonscape of driveways without homes and sidewalks without yards.
</P>
<P>
   The artist was trapped. He knew he would have to leave, but he
couldn't afford to buy another home until the airport offered him
more money. In 1995, Joseph Strickland, a Birmingham probate
attorney whose wife admired Holley's work, volunteered to represent
him. He enlisted a litigator friend of his, Frank Galloway, and
they negotiated for two years. In October 1997, with a trial date
looming, the authority finally agreed to pay Holley $165,700 _ more
than two-thirds of it for the estimated cost of relocating his
environment lock, stock and sandstone to a new home in
Harpersville.
</P>
<P>
   It was a do-it-yourself move. Over several weekends last spring,
Holley and some friends loaded rental trucks with everything they
could hoist. They couldn't get it all _ there was just too much.
Holley figures that almost half his pieces had been left behind
when the earthmoving equipment rumbled in to level the property.
Witnesses say it was like an archaeological dig turned upside down,
with workers burying, rather than unearthing, the artifacts of a
lost civilization.
</P>
<P>
   Holley had a compelling reason for not hiring professional
movers: He needed the money for his new home. His lawyers thought
he had no chance of getting a mortgage loan, with his erratic
earnings, so he paid $91,500 cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lonnie sat here and cried at the closing,'' Strickland
recalls. He was so happy and relieved that his troubles were
finally over.
</P>
<P>
   __
</P>
<P>
   Harpersville is a town of 1,000 that's little more than a 45-mph
hurdle on the four-lane sprint from Birmingham to Auburn. It's
known for its sod and Christmas tree farms, and for being something
of a speed trap; police cruisers often lay in wait at the city
limits on U.S. 231-280.
</P>
<P>
   The cops know Holley's neighborhood well. The official name is
Creswell, but people call it ``Crackwell'' because of all the drug
dealing. When a reporter stopped to talk to one of Holley's
neighbors recently, a sheriff's deputy followed him for a mile,
pulled him over and asked what he was doing at one of the biggest
crack houses in Shelby County. ``People get shot out here,'' she
warned.
</P>
<P>
   Holley and his lawyers knew nothing of the area's reputation
when they found the house in an 11th-hour rush to settle with the
airport. There was something else they didn't know: His new
neighbors did not want him there.
</P>
<P>
   Holley's house was a foreclosure. Annie Jews, the woman who had
lived there for years, lost the property in 1996 and was still
enraged. One night shortly after Holley moved in, he says, she
burst into the house and his bedroom demanding that he vacate the
premises.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even know who you are!'' he yelled.
</P>
<P>
   His new home was a fragile egg in a nest of resentment. The
woman's brother lived next door, another brother across the street
and their mother down the road. None of the kin was pleased to see
trucks dumping piles of rubbish and peculiar art on what had been
their relative's neatly mowed lawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lord have mercy, I wish somebody would get rid of that mess,''
says Annie Lou Garrett, the mother. ``I have to look at it every
time I drive to the doctor.''
</P>
<P>
   The bad feelings boiled over in a dispute over a small building
just within Holley's property. The Garretts use it as a sort of
juke joint; there's a pool table inside, and dozens of cans and
half-pints litter the parking lot on weekend mornings. Holley's
oldest son, 18-year-old Ezekial, wanted to set up a silk-screen
T-shirt shop in the building, but the Garretts refused to surrender
it.
</P>
<P>
   One day last summer, Ezekial got into a fistfight with Maurice
Garrett, the 28-year-old nephew of the woman who used to own their
house. That night, Holley says, Garrett burst into their home with
a gun vowing to kill Ezekial. Holley says he calmed him down and he
left.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, the Holleys discovered that someone had slashed
their tires. ``We knew who did it,'' Ezekial says. ``I saw Maurice
over there, so I told him he was going to have to pay for it, and
we got to arguing.''
</P>
<P>
   Police aren't clear on exactly what happened next. Someone
opened fire with a rifle. Ezekial ran into his house, and he and
his brothers starting firing back with a rifle, a shotgun and a
pistol. The shooting lasted 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like the OK Corral,'' Holley says. He had been upstairs
in his bedroom when the gunfire began. A shot crashed through the
window, shattering glass and frame, driving more than a dozen
slithers into his left forearm. As he waited, bleeding, for the
ambulance that would take him to the Coosa Valley Medical Center,
Holley spoke by phone to a hot-headed brother in Birmingham and
convinced him not to come down with a truckload of relatives and
guns to retaliate.
</P>
<P>
   Maurice Garrett, the only man charged in the incident, doesn't
come around the neighborhood much anymore. The other Garretts
remain. Holley recently sent an emissary to show them survey maps
to prove that the building is on his property. Unconvinced, they
continue to occupy it.
</P>
<P>
   The uneasy truce is palpable. Richard Garrett, the relative who
runs the juke joint, stands in front of his yellow frame house as a
chained dog snarls beneath a ``No Trespassing'' sign. ``I kept up
that lawn for my sister. That was a beautiful yard when she lived
over there. Nice flowers, nice shrubberies.'' He lights a cigarette
and his eyes narrow as he takes in the never-ending rummage sale
across the street. ``I know the man is an artist, but I think the
order of the place could be better.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the road, Holley looks up warily every time
he catches a hint of movement from the Garretts' direction. ``Those
people watch me like a hawk watches a chicken,'' he says.
``Sometimes I wish I could move again, but I can't afford to. It
looks like I got to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   Above him, the second-floor windows are still shot out. He has
replaced one of the panes with a jagged piece of mirror facing
outward, as if to guard against evil spirits. That old African folk
belief would be tested again soon enough.

 &HT;    Lonnie Holley's boys are going places _ good and bad
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Jim Auchmutey
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIANA, Ala. _ Lonnie Holley's workshops have as much to do
with redemption as art.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Koontz, an Atlanta psychiatrist who collects his work,
witnessed a remarkable session a few years ago at Laurel Ridge
Elementary School in DeKalb County. Holley's opening line jarred
everyone: He asked the first- and second-graders if any of them had
ever thought of killing themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could hear a pin drop,'' Koontz says. ``The adults were
all thinking, `What have we done inviting this man here?'''
</P>
<P>
   Silence hung over the classroom for 30 seconds. Then,
hesitantly, a few hands went up. The artist nodded understandingly
and told the students that, as a young man, he had once felt so bad
that he tried to hurt himself, but that he climbed out of his
despair after he discovered something he was good at _ carving
sandstone. With that, the Sandman took out his hacksaw blade and
showed the kids how to turn rocks into art. By the end of the day,
janitors and cafeteria workers were stopping by to listen.
</P>
<P>
   At 49, Holley has conducted hundreds of workshops over the
years. On the last Thursday in February, he conducted one that must
have been his most heartfelt. It was for teen-agers at the Shelby
County Regional Juvenile Detention Facility in Columbiana. One of
them, locked up since December, was his son Kubra.
</P>
<P>
   LOOKING FOR A WAY OUT
</P>
<P>
   It's little wonder that Holley has been thinking lately about
the biblical story of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego. His three
sons were jailed in December after the golf clubhouse behind their
home was burglarized and burned to the ground. Holley, who was
arrested as well, prays that his boys can come out of the fiery
furnace of crime and punishment unharmed, like the three captives
in the Book of Daniel. Having spent part of his childhood in a
brutal reform school, he knows how detention can singe a young
man's soul.
</P>
<P>
   ``My children are artists,'' he says, ``not criminals.''
</P>
<P>
   As winter warms to spring, this cold passage in Holley's life is
beginning to show the first signs of thaw. His bank account remains
empty, and he may yet serve time for allegedly receiving stolen
goods from the golf course (although his lawyer expects the charge
to be dropped or greatly reduced). The good news is that the
dispute with his neighbors seems to be diminishing; they finally
agreed to pay him rent for the building they have been using as a
juke joint. And the golf course may not sue after all, because
prosecutors hope to make any plea bargains contingent on some
restitution. The payments would be hard to make, but at least
Holley could keep his home.
</P>
<P>
   All those matters still weigh on him. But the matter that has
always weighed most heavily is the question of what happens to his
family. Its fate remains cloudy.
</P>
<P>
   Life is returning to normal for three of his children. Carlonie,
the 12-year-old, is attending her sixth-grade classes more
faithfully. Angela, 20, plans to work on her high school
equivalency degree as she raises her infant son and 3-year-old
daughter at her father's house. A.J., the youngest son, was
released from the transitional juvenile home where he spent most of
the winter. The high-spirited 13-year-old was sentenced to
probation and community service, and has resumed the seventh grade.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves the oldest sons, Ezekial and Kubra, who have always
assumed that they would become artists like their father. Both
started drawing when they were in diapers. Both tagged along to art
fairs and museum openings in a dozen states. Both have grown up to
be slender, strikingly handsome young men who show real potential
in their paintings and sculptures.
</P>
<P>
   Ezekial is the quiet one. At 18, he seems to carry a chip on his
shoulder from all the troubles he has seen befall his family. Not
that he hasn't added to them. After the Holleys moved to
Harpersville, he admits, he took part in another car theft _ his
second in two years _ and spent four months in the same reform
school his father had hated four decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   Kubra (pronounced co-BAR) is the outgoing one. When he was
arrested in December _ his first serious brush with the law _ he
went to work winning over his new keepers. Rebecca Seals, his
teacher at the juvenile center, was charmed by his personality and
impressed with his drawings. Soon her boss was taking the
16-year-old out of his cellblock and driving him to the Holley home
to fetch sandstone to sculpt.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I drove up,'' says John Miller, director of juvenile
court services, ``I thought, Oh, my God. I mean, I wouldn't want to
be their next-door neighbors. But all of that stuff means something
to them.'' He watched Kubra reach into a 50-gallon drum full of
rainwater and remove some sandstones that had been wrapped in old
sheets and insulation.
</P>
<P>
   Back at the detention center, Seals pointed to one piece and
asked Kubra if he could carve her a lion. She's a Leo. ``Yes,'' he
replied, smoothly. ``I believe I can see the lion in there.''
</P>
<P>
   The juvenile authorities were so taken with Kubra that they
nominated him for the Alabama School of Fine Arts, a magnet program
in Birmingham for gifted children from throughout the state. Seals
pulled together samples of his work and solicited recommendation
letters from museum officials who had worked with Holley. If he
were accepted, Kubra would likely serve at least a month in a
juvenile boot camp, then go to art school in the fall. The
worst-case scenario: He could be rejected and sentenced to the
reform school where his father and Ezekial had been put away.
</P>
<P>
   Being accepted was far from a sure thing. A few years ago,
Ezekial applied to the school and was turned down.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Zeke had gotten in, I don't think he would've gotten into
all this trouble,'' Holley says. ``An idle mind is the devil's
chance to whisper.''
</P>
<P>
   THE PLACES THEY WILL GO
</P>
<P>
   On the day of the workshop, Holley arrived at the juvenile
center looking very different from the way he looks when he's
making art in his yard. His hair was pulled back _ no dreadlocks _
and he wore green slacks, a blue banded-collar shirt and half-moon
glasses on a chain. He could have been Professor Holley.
</P>
<P>
   His lesson, as always, was the transformative power of art.
After Kubra introduced his father, Holley bent copper wire into
mobiles as he told the dozen or so teen-agers about the dicey
childhood that once landed him in a place like this. He sat at a
computer screen and drew faces with the mouse as he talked about
how he found art as a young man. He showed his listeners how to
carve and gave them blocks of sandstone to try for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like magic,'' Holley encouraged as he moved from boy to
boy. ``Your mind is magic.''
</P>
<P>
   When the two-hour session was finished, Miller, the juvenile
services director, was so pleased he fished into his billfold and
presented Holley with an impromptu honorarium of $50.
</P>
<P>
   A week later, the artist returned to visit Kubra, this time with
Ezekial. They were shown into the same classroom, where Kubra's
sandstones and drawings were displayed prominently. His father
smiled and said, ``He's going places, ain't he, Zeke?''
</P>
<P>
   Ezekial nodded. He seemed distracted. Perhaps he was thinking
about the places he might be going.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still want to follow in my father's footsteps,'' he said,
mentioning his interest in drawing and silk-screen printing, ``but
I've just had some problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Ezekial was charged, as an adult, with three felonies and two
misdemeanors in connection with the golf course raid. The two
gravest counts _ theft and arson _ could send him to prison for two
to 20 years apiece. ``I know I'm going to do time,'' he said,
softly.
</P>
<P>
   As Ezekial was contemplating punishment, his little brother
spent much of the winter in counseling with the teacher he calls
Miss Becky. ``Kubra and I have talked a lot about the lessons he
can draw from his family's problems,'' Seals confided. ``He has
seen his father used, abused and refused. But he's second
generation. He can learn about the business end of art and try to
stay away from the negatives.''
</P>
<P>
   Kubra definitely intends to become an artist and talks about
opening a gallery someday. ``I want to make sure my father's name
will not be lost,'' he said. ``I want us to be remembered.''
</P>
<P>
   As his visitors were leaving, Kubra delivered a line you don't
often hear from a juvenile detainee. ``Do you have my card?'' he
asked, digging into his pants pocket to present a colorful design
he had produced on a detention center computer. The focal point was
a surreal profile of his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``You made this?'' Holley said, examining the card with wonder,
as if it were a ten thousand dollar (CQ spelling out of word for
effect/ja) bill. ``You think you could make me one of these, son?''
</P>
<P>
   When word finally came that Kubra had been accepted at the
school of fine arts, he asked his teacher if she could help him
with a subject he needed to know more about. Not art. Math.
</P>
<P>
   THE ASSEMBLAGE OF LIFE
</P>
<P>
   Over the past couple of years, Holley says that he has sometimes
felt like he was watching a movie of his life. He sees a poor
family forced from their home, their yard and sculpture plowed
under. He sees their new home in the country surrounded by
resentful neighbors with guns. He sees his boys slipping out of the
house after midnight to do things he doesn't want to see. He sees
himself sitting in a cell thinking about the movie his life has
become.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, the creative flame has continued to burn within
him. The uprooting, the shooting, the arrests _ like the clutter in
his yard, the pieces of his life are so many materials for art.
</P>
<P>
   After he was released from jail in December, Holley went home
and made an assemblage from a rusty gate and a metal disk that he
called ``Through These Bars I See the Sun.'' When he went back to
jail in February, he fabricated a doll from toilet paper and towel
strings, and carved faces in the soap with his fingernails.
``There's nothing I can't make art from,'' he says, and you get the
feeling he's talking about something more than junk.
</P>
<P>
   Late last month, Holley finally got his hands on some spare cash
and asked a friend to drive him to the nearest Wal-Mart. He bought
$50 worth of generic house paint and set up the cans on a table in
his living room, across from the framed picture of him and Hillary
Clinton at the White House, during the exhibition that featured a
piece of his sculpture. In the same room, 10 weeks before, police
had handcuffed him and taken him to the county jail.
</P>
<P>
   Now, for the first time in months, Holley dipped a brush into a
can and began to paint.

 &HT;    Family in the fire: Artist struggles with crime, consequences
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Jim Auchmutey
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARPERSVILLE, Ala. _ When Lonnie Holley moved to his new home in
a cotton field outside Birmingham, he noticed that one of his
closest neighbors was a golf course, the Meadows. The adjoining
properties are like living museums of disparate cultures _ the
undulating fairways and close-cropped greens that hark back to
Scotland, the untamed yard of junk and eerie sculpture that harks
back to Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Holley knew something about that other culture. Years before he
emerged as one of the most imaginative Southern folk artists, he
had tended the grounds at a country club in Orlando. Now, looking
out his back yard toward the links, he had an idea: Maybe some of
those fellows in the Easter egg shirts would like to see his art
after they finished playing a round. Maybe he could set up a studio
and call it the 19th Hole. Maybe he'd just go over there and
introduce himself.
</P>
<P>
   He never got the chance. On the morning of Dec. 8, the
superintendent at the Meadows arrived for work before dawn to find
the clubhouse burned down. Police followed muddy golf cart tracks
as they led back to Holley's property and, ultimately, to his three
teen-age sons.
</P>
<P>
   And then the tracks turned on Holley himself.
</P>
<P>
   CHANCES HE NEVER HAD
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the cruelest aspect of Holley's current predicament is
the knowledge that his children got him into it. He is charged with
receiving stolen property: golf shirts, liquor, walkie-talkies and
other items deputies found inside his house. His oldest son is
accused of stealing the goods the night before, with help from his
two younger brothers, and then burning down the clubhouse in a
clumsy attempt to conceal the burglary. Holley says he was asleep
when it happened, sometime after midnight.
</P>
<P>
   In the annals of crime, such an incident might not rate a
footnote to a footnote. Teens stray into foolish destructiveness
all too
</P>
<P>
   often. But for the 49-year-old Holley, the consequences could be
far more serious than they would be for the father of a
middle-class delinquent in posh Atlanta suburbs. In the weeks after
the golf course caper, he worried that he could lose his freedom,
his home, even his family. At his first appearance before a judge,
he broke down in tears.
</P>
<P>
   It was a cold slap in the face to a man who has struggled for 20
years to give his children the chances he never had.
</P>
<P>
   If ever there was a motherless child, in the words of the old
spiritual, it was Lonnie Bradley Holley. The seventh of 27
children, he was taken away from his mother when he was 1 1/2 and
grew up in a blur of foster homes and reform schools. As a young
man, he started out repeating the cycle, fathering 10 children out
of wedlock before he was 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sisters would throw parties for me and introduce me to
girls,'' he says, sheepishly, ``and every time there was a party,
it seemed like there was another baby.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the babies came in Florida. When he was 15, Holley moved
to Orlando and worked as a cook for most of the next dozen years.
He lived with a woman there and had four children, all in their 20s
now. They stay in touch.
</P>
<P>
   Holley's second family began when he moved back to Alabama in
the late '70s and married a woman visiting from Ohio. Lonnie and
Carolyn Holley had five children together _ three boys and two
girls _ and made their home in an abandoned structure they bought
next to the Birmingham airport. It was a primitive place, with no
electricity or running water before Holley made some modest
improvements. Still, Carolyn grew unhappy with the conditions and
started spending more time with her relatives up North, moving out
for good in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, she was arrested as an accomplice in the
armed robbery of a pizza delivery man in Newark, Ohio. She spent
six years in prison and took a factory job in Cincinnati after she
was paroled. She has no plans to rejoin her husband in Alabama.
``Lonnie wanted me to do art,'' she explains. ``I want to work.''
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, his wife's absence left Holley motherless again. He
had fathered 15 children and was suddenly left to be both father
and mother to his youngest five, none of whom was older than 10.
Until then, the artist admits, he had drunk excessively _ as much
as two or three bottles of wine a day at the beginning of his
marriage. He could have gone back to the heavy boozing. He could
have turned his kids over to the state. He could have run away.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he says, he sobered up. He took his children to the
Holiness church. He insisted they attend school. He taught them how
to draw and sculpt, and carried them to art fairs so they could
sell their work and buy shoes and clothes with the money. Angela,
the firstborn, kept records of her father's artwork. Ezekial, the
oldest son, liked to paint. Kubra (pronounced coo-BAR) took to
carving, while little brother Arthur James gravitated toward music.
Carlonie, the kid sister, won a blue ribbon at school for a
painting that she said was about ``women who forget to take care of
their children.'' They were handsome youngsters, growing tall and
lean like their daddy, and people were impressed with their polite
manners and creative potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lonnie has been a wonderful father to those children,'' says
Marcia Weber, a Montgomery art dealer who befriended the family.
She remembers visiting Holley when Carlonie would come home from
school and climb into his lap to tell him what she had learned that
day. She was an honors student, and he loved it when she read to
him. Never having made it past the seventh grade, he couldn't read
very well himself.
</P>
<P>
   A VERY BAD NIGHT
</P>
<P>
   The Holleys inhabited one of the oddest worlds a father ever
created for his family. Their home was in the middle of a wooded
acre that looked like something between a junkyard and an enchanted
forest teeming with carved African faces. Through the years, the
thickets of art and scrap multiplied as Holley hauled salvage home
and made found-object assemblages from it. And then, as his
children were entering their teens, their strange, magical world
crumbled around them.
</P>
<P>
   For five years, the Holleys fought the Birmingham airport
expansion that was obliterating all the surrounding houses. Vandals
and thieves picked apart the family's environment, stealing art,
carting off materials, once even breaking into the house to snatch
Christmas gifts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard watching what they were doing to my father,'' says
Ezekial, 18, who got into fights with grown men who were trying to
pilfer from their yard.
</P>
<P>
   One theft really set him off. His father, who liked to tinker
with old cars, would bring junkers home and promise a different one
to each child. Ezekial had been pledged a white Chevy Suburban. One
morning it wasn't there; someone had swiped it.
</P>
<P>
   Not long afterward, he and a friend stole a car in Birmingham,
and police caught them. Ezekial was sent to an Alabama boot camp
for juvenile offenders and ordered to pay $3,500 in restitution for
running into the police cruiser that pulled them over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zeke just came unhinged,'' says Atlanta art collector Bill
Arnett, who has been intimately involved with the family for 13
years. ``He had never had any problems until the mid-'90s. Then he
saw all these things happening to his father and their property,
and he started missing school and disappearing for two or three
days at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   Things grew worse last year when the family settled with the
airport and moved to a foreclosed house in Harpersville. First
Holley was shot in a dispute with a neighbor. Then all his children
started skipping school. Kubra, 16, missed 43 days of the first
semester alone. Even Carlonie, the 12-year-old honors student,
began staying out.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 8, a juvenile judge warned Holley that if he wanted to
keep his children, the truancy had to stop. He had just returned
from court that afternoon, worried sick, when the police stormed in
with a search warrant.
</P>
<P>
   They found most of the things that had been stolen from the golf
course in Holley's basement. They also found marijuana, smoking
pipes and, out in the yard, a dead dog hanging from the nylon mesh
where, Holley assumes, it had strangled in one of his assemblages.
</P>
<P>
   Father and sons were led away in handcuffs. Kubra and
13-year-old A.J. were taken to a juvenile detention facility.
Ezekial was thrown in jail and charged with theft, arson, burglary
and possession of marijuana. In addition to receiving stolen
property, Holley was charged with cruelty to animals and possession
of marijuana and drug paraphernalia.
</P>
<P>
   The boys have been advised not to talk about what happened that
night, but they have unburdened themselves to their father. ``They
got drunk and went on a late-night ride at the golf course,'' he
says. ``They feel bad about it.''
</P>
<P>
   If Holley does not seem furious with his children, perhaps it is
because he understands their frustrations. ``I got angry with Zeke
when he stole the car. I got angry with Angela when she got
pregnant at 16 and dropped out of school. But I'm not in that angry
mood now,'' he says. ``My children have been through so much. I
think what happened in December, they were getting back at the
community. It was like they were saying, `Daddy, we need to get out
of here.' They were running away from the hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the other charges, Holley admits that Ezekial was smoking
marijuana with some friends. ``I don't do that stuff,'' he says,
noting that it would not be unusual to find paraphernalia in the
house because he sometimes uses it in anti-drug artwork.
</P>
<P>
   The animal cruelty count particularly rankles him. Holley sees
himself as a teacher who has shown thousands of schoolchildren how
to carve sandstone at his workshops. ``I don't want them thinking
the Sandman kills dogs,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   COMING TOGETHER
</P>
<P>
   On a cool February afternoon, Holley was puttering with some
materials in his yard when a car pulled into the driveway. Three
child welfare officers were coming to inspect. He had company and
persuaded them to return later, but the prospect of strangers
probing his domestic life clearly vexed him. Outsiders might not
understand.
</P>
<P>
   The Holley home is dedicated to the proposition that every child
is an artist waiting to blossom. The inside of the house feels as
jumbled and untidy as the yard. Daddy planned it that way. Every
room is cluttered with scrap or drawing paper or cans of paint,
because the urge to create can strike anywhere. That burnt smell in
the kitchen isn't cookies; it's a gingerbread man Carlonie
fashioned from mud and popped into the microwave. She's always
making something as she half-watches the TV that blares in the
living room.
</P>
<P>
   As unusual as it looks and smells, the home radiates the
unmistakable warmth of old-fashioned family love. The Holleys are
close, and the misfortunes of the past year seem to have pulled
them closer. The child welfare inspectors picked up on it. ``Mr.
Holley loves his children and wants them in his house,'' one report
said. ``The children love their father and respect his art.''
</P>
<P>
   Later that day, Holley and half his brood piled into a
reporter's car to visit Kubra at the juvenile detention center in
the county seat of Columbiana. A.J. squeezed into the back seat
with Angela and a friend of hers and Carlonie, who held her
20-year-old sister's infant son in her lap. (Ezekial, out on bail,
was staying with an aunt.) After a stop for chips and Mello Yellos,
the conversation took an unexpected turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Angela,'' her father instructed, ``tell him about the bus.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems that a week after the golf course incident, Angela was
visiting her mother in Cincinnati and got into a fight with a bus
driver who had closed the door in her mother's face. She was
charged with disorderly conduct and spent the night behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like Rosa Parks,'' Angela said, in a defiant tone that
hints at how the incident might have happened.
</P>
<P>
   Let's see: four arrests in Alabama, one in Ohio _ that would
leave Carlonie the only family member unhassled by the authorities,
right?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' Holley answered, with uncommon honesty, ``the
juveniles were on me about her about missing school, so I guess she
was in trouble, too.''
</P>
<P>
   At the detention center, father and son disappeared into the
Plexiglas visiting room to talk with Kubra, as the rest of them
tried to watch through a tiny security-mesh window. Then the girls
got a chance to hug their brother. Everyone was quiet as they came
out and the heavy door slammed shut behind them.
</P>
<P>
   On the way home, the conversation took another unexpected turn.
Holley mentioned that he had one more brush with law and order in
December _ this time as a victim. When he was released after two
nights in jail, he returned home to discover that someone had
broken in and stolen his family's Christmas gifts _ A.J. and
Carlonie's bicycles, everything. It was just like being back at the
airport.
</P>
<P>
   Most fathers would have reported such an incident. Holley didn't
bother. ``I didn't want to see the police just then,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   `HE NEEDS TO LOSE ALL THAT'
</P>
<P>
   The law is only one of Holley's worries.
</P>
<P>
   On a hill less than a mile behind his house, at the end of a
winding lane grandly named Plantation Drive, there's a rectangle of
naked earth where the clubhouse and pro shop of the Meadows once
stood. It was a custom manufactured doublewide, 55 by 28 feet, with
a large deck on the back. Now there's a single trailer parked on
the ashes, looking less like a clubhouse than a construction
office.
</P>
<P>
   Elbert Buckelew, the course's majority owner, estimates the loss
at more than $100,000. ``Unfortunately,'' he says, ``we were
somewhat underinsured.''
</P>
<P>
   Buckelew is not ignorant of his neighbor's fame. His wife was
head of the Jefferson County Commission in Birmingham when a group
of arts lovers asked the panel to help move Holley's environment
from the path of the airport expansion. The request was denied.
It's safe to say that Buckelew would not have been a likely
candidate for Holley's idea about inviting golfers over to see his
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The same people who appreciate his art probably liked that pee
in the bottle,'' Buckelew says, referring to Andres Serrano's
``Piss Christ,'' the crucifix-in-urine piece that Sen. Jesse Helms
crucified as an example of the horrors of government funding for
the arts.
</P>
<P>
   But this isn't about taste in art, Bucklelew says. This is about
property rights and wrongs.
</P>
<P>
   It has happened to him before. He used to be a pharmacist and
was robbed at gunpoint three times. The golf course itself was
burglarized last fall before the arson. ``We were robbed _ I don't
have a problem with that,'' he says. ``But, dammit, why'd they have
to burn it down? I don't care if he's a damn Picasso, he's got to
be responsible for his kids.''
</P>
<P>
   To recover his losses, Buckelew is considering suing Holley
under an Alabama law that holds parents accountable for the actions
of their children. ``I find it hard to fathom that he didn't know
something about what his sons were doing,'' he says. ``We need to
see if he was involved in any way. Because if he was, he needs to
lose all that.''
</P>
<P>
   He means Holley's property, the white-columned house and 16
acres he bought for $91,500. Holley may rue the day he moved to
Harpersville, into an area known for crack-dealing, onto a street
where he would be assaulted, into a school district his children
would despise. But this is the only home he's got, the only thing
of tangible value that he has to show for 20 years of making art
and raising a family against the odds.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all I've been through, I don't need to be losing this,''
Holley says. ``If I lose this ...''
</P>
<P>
   He draws a deep breath and falls silent. He cannot bear to
finish the thought.

 &HT;    Lonnie Holley has rich imagination but thin wallet
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    WITH SEE-ART sidebar at end of file
 &HT;    By Jim Auchmutey
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BIRMINGHAM, Ala. _ It's not easy to create art when a neighbor
is shooting at you. Yet somehow, in the midst of such troubles, the
acclaimed folk artist Lonnie Holley managed to make enough
paintings and sculptures for a show of his work last fall. The
pieces, priced from $170 to $5,000, sold reasonably well and
provided virtually his only income for 1998. The remaining works
are still on display at the Monty Stabler Galleries, a posh salon
in the upscale Birmingham suburb of Homewood.
</P>
<P>
   As she flips through the paintings _ all of them on paper _
Stabler wishes she had more on canvas, but knows why she doesn't.
``Lonnie works on what he can afford,'' she says. ``He can't afford
canvas.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years into a career that has brought him national
recognition, Lonnie Holley has no money. His phone has been cut off
several times. He owes his lawyer, his oldest son's lawyer, the
hospital that treated him after he was wounded, the ambulance
service that took him to the hospital. His '87 Dodge van was
repossessed in January. His '74 Chevy van, in need of a new
transmission, sat in the driveway for weeks like another of his
found objects.
</P>
<P>
   One day last month, Holley was crouched in front of his house
working on a carving when his 12-year-old daughter, Carlonie,
walked up with the mail. Good, maybe there was a check. He ripped
into a promising-looking letter and rolled his eyes. It was a $72
fine for driving with a busted headlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be self-sufficient,'' he said. ``I thought I had
enough art out there to support us. But it looks like I might be
going back on food stamps, and I hate that.''
</P>
<P>
   `WE AIN'T BOOKKEEPERS'
</P>
<P>
   The perpetually struggling artist is a figure as old as clay.
Perhaps nowhere in the art world is the stereotype more fitting
than in the realm of folk art. Like the blues singers of old, the
self-taught artists of the South have invented a fresh, personal
form of expression from the rough material of their lives. And like
those blues pioneers, their work has seldom brought prosperity to
them or their families.
</P>
<P>
   As folk art has grown more popular during the 1980s and '90s, a
few artists have fared well _ Georgia's Howard Finster and
Alabama's Thornton Dial, for example. But most remained poor or
close to it. Many felt that they had been taken advantage of by
collectors who paid too little or dealers who took works on
consignment and kept most of the proceeds when they sold at greatly
inflated prices.
</P>
<P>
   Today, at the annual Folk Fest in Atlanta or the Outsider Art
Fair in New York, conversations often turn to the hard-luck tales
behind the work. You might hear that Joe Light, a Memphis painter,
has filed for bankruptcy again. Or that Richard Burnside, a painter
in Pendleton, S.C., is still living in a shack worthy of a Walker
Evans photo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sad story,'' says New Orleans dealer Richard Gasperi.
``It looks like the artists are getting ripped off, and sometimes
they are. But usually it has more to do with them having large
families to support and not knowing how to handle money.''
</P>
<P>
   Gasperi once tried to help an artist named David Butler, an
elderly disabled laborer who was living in crude conditions in
Morgan City, La. ``I gave him money and tried to get him to improve
his house, but it went straight to family members who were using
drugs. I couldn't intervene and change things.''
</P>
<P>
   When Butler died two years ago, Gasperi says, he was penniless.
</P>
<P>
   Holley is only 49 and certainly has the talent to escape such a
fate. The question is whether he has the savvy _ or can find
someone who does.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me and Lonnie, we don't know how to do business,'' says
Holley's longtime friend Charlie Lucas, an Alabama sculptor who has
not mastered the art of making ends meet either. ``We ain't
bookkeepers. We don't have secretaries. We're very rich people; we
just don't have none of the money.''
</P>
<P>
   `WE BELONG IN THE DIRT'
</P>
<P>
   Before he became an artist in 1979, Holley earned solid wages as
a cook and construction worker. Those were jobs. When he discovered
art, he saw it as a calling. Unfortunately, the sandstone
priesthood didn't pay as well as blue-collar work. Holley estimates
that he has never cleared more than $21,000 a year as an artist
(although friends who have helped support the family believe the
amount must be higher). The federal poverty level for a single
parent supporting five children is $21,373.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Holley's patronage has come from one man, Atlanta
collector Bill Arnett, a bespectacled 59-year-old whose combative
personality and zealous pursuit of folk art have made him one of
the most controversial names in the field. Arnett first beheld
Holley's environment in 1986 and was so moved that he agreed to
advance the artist a regular income in exchange for the right of
first refusal on his symbolic assemblages. Arnett reckons that he
has paid Holley well over $100,000 since then and has received
perhaps 200 sculptures and 50 to 100 paintings in return.
</P>
<P>
   Once, early on, Arnett tried to persuade Holley to move his
family from their primitive home at the Birmingham airport to a
much nicer farmhouse near Villa Rica, Ga. He even offered to
finance the purchase. But the thought of dwelling in such
middle-class surroundings made Holley uncomfortable, and he backed
out, telling Arnett, ``We belong in the dirt.''
</P>
<P>
   After the airport ousted him a year and a half ago, Holley got a
middle-class home, in Harpersville, whether he wanted it or not.
But he no longer had Arnett's financial support.
</P>
<P>
   The collector says he is nearly broke from years of acquiring
art and supporting Holley and more than a dozen other artists
across the South. Arnett's latest project, self-publishing a lavish
book about self-taught artists, has left him so strapped that he
says he'll have to sell his house on a very expensive street near
the Governor's Mansion in Buckhead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't given Lonnie a penny in three years,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Arnett did take more than 75 assemblages for a
re-creation of Holley's environment in ``Souls Grown Deep,'' the
Olympic Arts Festival exhibition that was drawn from his
collection. Arnett says they belong to Holley and he is storing
them for safekeeping. Holley does not object to the arrangement; he
figures the pieces would have vanished if they had stayed at his
airport property as the thieves and bulldozers were closing in. Now
there's talk of putting some of the work up for sale at an Atlanta
show.
</P>
<P>
   As much as Holley's alliance with Arnett has helped him, it may
have hampered him in other ways. Some dealers have shied away from
the artist because of the perception that they were poaching on
Arnett's territory. ``I like Lonnie's work very much,'' says Robert
Cargo, a veteran dealer in Tuscaloosa, ``but I was uncomfortable
with the thought that someone else was getting his best work.''
</P>
<P>
   The roots of Holley's money problems go much deeper than one
relationship, however.
</P>
<P>
   Some galleries have found the logistics of dealing with him too
taxing. ``He was never easy to get on the phone, and you never knew
whether he was going to be there if you went,'' says New York
dealer Luise Ross, who last showed Holley's work in 1994. ``He's a
very good artist, but is he good enough that I should go crazy to
get his stuff?''
</P>
<P>
   Others have found Holley's art difficult to sell. While his
colorful paintings and sinuous sandstones have fetched as much as
$5,000, the conceptual sculptures he makes from trash are another
matter.
</P>
<P>
   Curators and critics adore Holley's junk. His assemblages are
the pieces that usually end up in museums, from the Smithsonian
Institution to the High Museum of Art in Atlanta. Holley may mangle
the king's English when he speaks, but he has a rare eloquence when
he employs his visual vocabulary. ``He uses objects like a poet
uses words,'' says Joanne Cubbs, the High's first folk art curator,
who was amazed by Holley's ability to improvise ideas and meanings
from the humblest of materials. She once saw him take a hanger, a
ratty T-shirt, a plastic flower and a rusty lock, and create a
moving assemblage about remembering a dead child. Family, religion,
racial pride, the environment _ his sculpture is always about
something. ``I've never met anyone who can spin ideas from almost
nothing the way he does,'' Cubbs says.
</P>
<P>
   As thought-provoking as such work can be in a museum, it isn't
the sort of thing many people want in their homes. Dealers say
there is little market for Holley's assemblages. They are not cute
like so much popular folk art. In fact, they can be grim and
disturbing.
</P>
<P>
   ``One time I got there and he was making this assemblage out of
IV needles,'' says Montgomery gallery owner Marcia Weber. ``I
wouldn't touch it with a 10-foot pole. Think of the liability. It
may have been a great work of art, but I can't imagine anyone
buying medical waste to put in their living room.''
</P>
<P>
   There's one other reason for Holley's money woes. Almost
everyone who knows him believes he can be too generous for his own
good.
</P>
<P>
   Holley has contributed to the United Negro College Fund and to
famine relief at the same time he was haunting supermarket loading
docks to get out-of-date groceries to feed his family. He has
always given money and meals to relatives and neighbors, even those
who treated him shabbily.
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn Holley, his estranged wife, remembers how people scoffed
at the weird environment they inhabited in Birmingham. ``They'd
call him the voodoo man. But those same people, whenever they
wanted something to drink or some food or money, they'd come to
Lonnie because they knew he'd help.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Holley is looking for someone to help him.
</P>
<P>
   TRYING TO 'STOP THE BLEEDING'
</P>
<P>
   For years, Holley has asked acquaintances in the art world if
they would assist him in managing his affairs. A long line of good
Samaritans has come to his aid, but no one ever had the time or
stamina to stay with it. This winter, as Holley's life scraped
bottom, the lawyers who represented him in his airport battle found
a new recruit.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Lasseter, an owlish Birmingham furniture maker who has
known Holley for a few years, read about his arrest in the December
golf course burglary and drove to Harpersville to see whether the
family had enough food. He ended up delivering considerably more
than dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I'm Lonnie's manager,'' he says, with the wry smile of
a man who got more than he bargained for. ``It's taken over my
life.''
</P>
<P>
   For the past six weeks, in addition to his regular job, Lasseter
has been driving the Holleys to stores, courts, jails and
junkyards. He has confronted their hostile neighbors over the
building they refuse to vacate even though it's on Holley's
property. And he is working with Arnett to contact galleries across
the nation in an effort to account for any art Holley might have
out on consignment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lonnie is one of the most decent people I've ever met,''
Lasseter says. ``I'm doing everything I can to ease his mind and
let him get back to his art. People have taken advantage of him.
I'm just trying to stop the bleeding.''
</P>
<P>
   The triage has not been simple.
</P>
<P>
   One Saturday last month, Arnett drove over from Atlanta to meet
Lasseter and Holley for dinner at Richey's B-B-Q in Harpersville.
As they talked about how to get his career restarted, Arnett showed
them proofs of his book. Holley was excited to see slick color
reproductions of so much of his work.
</P>
<P>
   They were walking out to the parking lot afterward when a
policeman intercepted them. He was polite; he had noticed them
inside and didn't want to interrupt their conference ... but the
thing was, well, there was another warrant out for Holley's arrest.
It seems he had missed a juvenile hearing for his sons.
</P>
<P>
   Holley winced. He remembered. Some child welfare workers had
dropped by to inspect the house that day, and he had just plain
forgotten about court.
</P>
<P>
   The artist was taken straight from his barbecued chicken plate
to jail, where he spent the next three nights locked up, wondering
what else could go wrong.
</P>

TELLING DETAILS IN REPORT THAT FELLED EUROPEAN GROUP
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium &UR;  &LR; _ As a retired dentist from the French
provincial town of Chatellerault, Rene Berthelot had no obvious
qualifications to work as a scientific adviser to the 15-nation
European Union.
</P>
<P>
   But work he did, for three years, earning close to $200,000 and
undertaking no less than 13 ``missions'' to Chatellerault, during
which time he produced no report of even remote value to the
European Union.
</P>
<P>
   What Berthelot did do, it seems, is help out Edith Cresson, the
former French prime minister who, as the European Union's
commissioner for education and training, hired him in 1995. Ms.
Cresson also happened to be the mayor of Chatellerault until the
end of 1997 and an old friend of the dentist.
</P>
<P>
   Berthelot's activities _ or lack of them _ figure prominently in
an independent report published this week on the European
Commission, the Brussels-based executive body that controls a wide
range of European policy. The ``fictitious nature of his scientific
advice,'' as the report described Berthelot's contribution, at the
expense of European taxpayers illustrates the failings that led all
20 commissioners to resign.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps more extraordinary than his deeds is the reaction of
Ms. Cresson, who has said she feels ``satisfied'' with her
``considerable achievements.'' In her defiance, it seems, a gulf
has been revealed between the old pliant political culture of
Europe and an emerging one that is far less tolerant of cronyism.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, with the Cold War over, moral concerns in European
politics have grown where strategic imperatives were once
paramount, bringing first a political revolution in Italy driven by
a magistrate, then investigations of corruption in France, Spain
and Belgium, and, this week, the collapse of the European
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Olivier Duhamel, a French political scientist, warned Wednesday
of ``a Ken Starrization of European politics.'' But the real issue
seems to be the demands for accountability among the more than 300
million citizens of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cresson, a 65-year-old Socialist, is a product of the
Mitterrand era, one marked by corruption scandals that are still
under investigation and a style of rule that sometimes appeared to
place the Elysee Palace and its acolytes beyond the law.
</P>
<P>
   Jacques Santer of Luxembourg, the commission president, and at
61 a man of the same political generation as Ms. Cresson, also
appeared to misread the continent's mood. On Tuesday, the day after
the report's publication, he said he was ``whiter than white,''
although the report accuses him of being ``evasive'' and
``misleading'' in response to inquiries from the European
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   His appearance of stonewalling evidently failed to impress a new
generation of leaders _ including Prime Minister Tony Blair of
Britain and Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder of Germany, who said
Wednesday that there was no possibility of Santer's being
reinstated and made clear that the search for a successor had
begun.
</P>
<P>
   Santer changed his tone Wednesday, approving a commission
statement that said, ``We request member states to name a new
commission without delay.'' It added that while the departing
20-member executive body would not take ``any new political
initiatives.''
</P>
<P>
   What becomes clear in the 144-page report prepared by a
five-member panel is that, with $100 billion a year to spend, the
European Union had undertaken many initiatives: aid for countries
in the southern Mediterranean, aid for vocational training, and
other areas.
</P>
<P>
   But the commission, which oversees a 17,000-member bureaucracy,
had neither the trained personnel nor the commitment to openness in
financial matters to insure that the initiatives were properly
controlled.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commission has seen its direct management responsibilities
increase substantially,'' the report said. But ``its administrative
and financial culture'' have not ``developed at the same speed.''
</P>
<P>
   More than $2 million was lost or misspent, the report says,
after the commission entered into contracts with three companies
(two of which were controlled by the third Luxembourg-based
company), for the distribution of aid in the former Yugoslavia and
in the Rift Valley of Africa. In fact, none of the contracted
services were ever performed.
</P>
<P>
   Another contract with a French company called Agenor that was
supposed to provide ``technical assistance'' for a $600 million
program of vocational training started in 1995 turned out to be a
thinly disguised cover for fraud, the report says.
</P>
<P>
   Double or fraudulent invoicing, wildly inflated fees, a printing
contract with a company that did not in fact exist _ all this was
standard practice at Agenor, the report says.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite an audit in July 1997, and repeated requests for
corrective action to Ms. Cresson, who oversaw the program, the
situation was allowed to fester for more than a year. It was on
this matter that Santer also proved ``evasive'' when questioned by
the European Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course these matters are grave,'' said Patrick Child, a
spokesman for Yves Thibault de Silguy, a French commissioner. ``But
there is some regret here that a wholesale portrait of a shambles
has been drawn as a result of the actions of a few people.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the report's conclusion that nobody with ``the
slightest sense of responsibility'' appears exaggerated to those
who believe that there are many dedicated servants of Europe at the
commission. But the high moral tone of the investigators accurately
reflects a new European mood that the commission failed to read
before it was too late.

CRASH VICTIMS' FAMILIES FIND SOLACE IN FAITH AND PRAYER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Miss., Tenn., Ill., La.)  (Eds: See also TRAIN-CRASH) 
(mk) 
 By DAVID FIRESTONE with BILL DEDMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NESBIT, Miss. _ No one here ever truly understood how June
Bonnin managed to stay alive, holding cancer at bay, refusing all
treatment and relying on prayer to consume her tumors and growths.
But she did survive, building a splendid white inn here with the
extra years granted to her, and the delight she took in beating the
odds magnified the impact on her friends of her sudden death on
Monday night on the Amtrak train that crashed outside of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Bonnin, 46, along with her 11-year-old granddaughter,
Jessica Whitaker, and two young girls from this same rural suburb
of Memphis, Tenn., Rainey Lipscomb, 10, and her sister Lacey, 8,
were aboard the sleeper car that took the brunt in the wreck, which
killed them and is believed to have killed seven others. They had
gone to Chicago, with four other family members, for a long
weekend, touring the aquarium and the Children's Museum. The girls
were particularly thrilled to have visited a store that sells
American Girls historical dolls, their favorites.
</P>
<P>
   The Lipscombs and the Bonnins, neighbors and best of friends,
shared substantial prosperity and a love of the lakes of
northwestern Mississippi. They both owned large properties here in
DeSoto County, at the edge of Memphis' growth south into the
sloping farmland of Mississippi. But what tied their lives
together, particularly in the final years, was a deep religious
faith that family members repeatedly called on Wednesday in an
effort to fathom three very short lives and one that had been
extended.
</P>
<P>
   ``June amazed me, all the time,'' said Ada Johnston, a neighbor
and friend who held her 50th wedding anniversary party at the Bonne
Terre Country Inn, a luxurious bed-and-breakfast on 50 acres owned
by the Bonnin family, which drew a devoted clientele from several
nearby states. ``She was an upright Christian woman, which I guess
is what kept her going,'' Ms. Johnston continued. ``She fought so
hard and now it's all over in a train wreck. So sad.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Mrs. Bonnin was told she had advanced non-Hodgkin's
lymphoma, which is usually fatal. Her doctors urged her to undergo
chemotherapy and radiation, but even though she was brought up a
Roman Catholic and had never believed in faith healing, she decided
to seek treatment only through prayer and natural medication. After
a tumor the size of a golf ball was found in her brain in 1997, she
refused to have it removed. Mrs. Bonnin's doctors told The Memphis
Commercial-Appeal last year that they did not know how she had
survived. Everyone else in Mrs. Bonnin's natural-treatment group
died, but Mrs. Bonnin remained well enough that many guests at
Bonne Terre never knew of her illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you didn't know she was sick, you would never have been
able to tell,'' said Erling Jensen, a Memphis chef whom Ms. Bonnin
and her husband, Max, hired to consult on the inn's menu of roasted
meats and seafood. ``She seemed like a 19-year-old, always laughing
and running around the grounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Max Bonnin, 44, said Wednesday that he would get through his
ordeal the same way she did.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's in a place she's dreamed about, and everyone up in
heaven is having a good time with her,'' Bonnin said. ``Her
successful battle with cancer has been a result of faith in God and
friends. That's how we got through, and that's how we'll get
through this.''
</P>
<P>
   Matt Lipscomb, the father of the two girls who died on the
train, said his family, members of the United Methodist Church,
were in a prayer group with the Bonnins, and shared a faith that he
considered life-giving.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way I can sit here and talk with you about this is
that I have the assurance of knowing that our little girls are with
Jesus,'' Lipscomb said Wednesday, after returning from Illinois,
where he identified their bodies. ``Just a week ago, we had what we
now know was a little gift given to us by God _ one of the girls
was asking us a lot of questions about what heaven would be like.
As bizarre as that sounds, that was not a coincidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Lipscomb, whose family owns the largest independent insurance
agency in Tennessee, said the girls played tennis and went fishing.
Rainey played a Von Trapp child in a recent school production of
``The Sound of Music.'' Before the girls headed to the sleeping car
to join Mrs. Bonnin and Jessica, Lipscomb said, they gave their
mother, Cindy, who was in a different car, a thank-you note for the
week and they also thanked her for letting them stay in the
sleeping car that night.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were just getting ready to go to bed when it hit,'' said
Jessica's mother, Kelley Whitaker, 31, who went back to the
railroad tracks Wednesday with Bonnin to lay a wreath.
</P>
<P>
   Bonnin said he and his wife had planned to build a white prayer
chapel with a steeple at Bonne Terre. He said he may still build
it.

 &HT;    Bill to deregulate most of the state's electric industry OK'd
 &HT;    By Bruce Hight
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A bill to deregulate most of the state's $17 billion electric
industry won easy approval from the Texas Senate on Wednesday, but
almost four hours of debate and several dozen amendments by
senators revealed some nagging doubts that likely will be aired
more fully in the House.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, by Sen. David Sibley, R-Waco, got final approval on a
voice vote with only three senators registering their opposition:
Sen. Gonzalo Barrientos, D-Austin; Sen. Carlos Truan, D-Corpus
Christi; and Sen. Drew Nixon, R-Carthage.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the Senate finished work on Sibley's bill early
Wednesday evening, the man who will carry it in the House, state
Rep. Steve Wolens, D-Dallas, perched on the brass rail surrounding
the senators' desks watching the closing minutes of the debate.
Wolens, chairman of the House State Affairs Committee, said he
expects the committee to take up the bill in three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Under Sibley's deregulation bill, customers of investor-owned
utilities would automatically get a 5 percent rate cut when
competition begins Jan. 1, 2002 _ saving them as much as $800
million, Sibley said. Consumers also should be able to buy power at
an additional 10 percent off or more from competitors ``if they're
willing to shop,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers who want to stick with their old utility could; no one
would be required to switch.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jane Nelson, R-Flower Mound, said that competition would
bring ``not only lower rates but improved service.''
</P>
<P>
   Only investor-owned utilities would be required to open
themselves to competition. The Austin City Council would retain the
power to decide whether to open its utility, Austin Energy, to
competition. Likewise, other municipalities and electric
cooperatives such as Pedernales Electric Cooperative Inc. also
would be able to decide for themselves whether they wanted to
participate in a competitive market.
</P>
<P>
   One amendment added by Sibley was of special interest to Austin:
the state will not sell power generated with fuels from state lands
to state and local government agencies in areas not opened to
competition. Austin Energy had feared the original provision,
expected to generate money for public education as well as cut
utility costs for governments which buy the power, would cut into
the extensive business it does with state government here.
</P>
<P>
   Barrientos said he voted against the bill, however, because no
residential or small business customer called on him for the right
to shop for power. He also voted against it, he said, because
``when my gut, my intuition has a question, I vote no.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Nixon said, ``I don't see the great public necessity
for what we're doing here.'' Only the utility companies and their
big industrial consumers want competition, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Signs of unease about the impact of opening the electric
business to competition in Texas came in two other ways. One was an
amendment by Sen. Bill Ratliff, R-Mt. Pleasant, chairman of the
Senate Finance Committee. His amendment would have allowed a city
government to declare itself the representative of all residential
and small business consumers in its jurisdiction in order to buy
power for them wholesale.
</P>
<P>
   Ratliff said he knew industrial and other big business customers
could take care of themselves, but he worried that many a
residential and small business customer, especially in smaller
towns, would be ``left to find for himself or herself without any
negotiating leverage.''
</P>
<P>
   Sibley, who seldom differs with Ratliff, opposed the amendment,
saying that the Dallas and Houston city councils, ``or some other
benevolent group,'' could keep too many customers who want to shop
for power from doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Ratliff's amendment was defeated on a voice vote.
</P>
<P>
   Another sign of unease about the deregulation bill was
indicative in an amendment proposed by Barrientos, to shift more of
an estimated $3.3 billion in stranded costs from residential to
commercial and industrial customers. Stranded cost is the
difference between what the utilities invested in their facilities,
mostly nuclear power plants, and their market value, which is
expected to be much less.
</P>
<P>
   The Barrientos amendment failed, but by the relatively narrow
margin of 19-12.
</P>
<P>
   Despite those ruffles, Sibley had clear command of the Senate.
Without exception, if he favored an amendment, it passed; if he
didn't, it failed.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Sen. Steve Ogden, R-Bryan, proposed an amendment to
require municipally owned utilities to notify their customers if
they decide not to open themselves to competition. The public,
Ogden said, ``should be fully informed about what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Eddie Lucio, D-Brownsville, who rose to object that Ogden
was trying to ``strongarm municipals to opt into the marketplace.''
Brownsville and Bryan both have city-owned utilities.
</P>
<P>
   Sibley opposed the amendment, and it died after the Senate set
it aside on a voice vote. One amendment that did pass was proposed
by Sen. Royce West, D-Dallas to bar electric competitors from
refusing service to a customer because of ``race, creed, color,
national origin, ancestry, sex, marital status, lawful source of
income, disability or familial status.'' Nor could a provider
refuse a customer because he or she lives in a low-income area.

SOME EMERGING MARKETS REBOUND AFTER 25 PERCENT DROP IN YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is like the tree falling in the forest when no one is around.
But quietly, some emerging stock markets have turned around after a
year that their sector dropped 25 percent as a whole and some
individual markets plunged more than 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican stock market is up 26 percent this year in dollar
terms. In India, the market is up 20 percent, also in dollars,
while South Africa is up 13 percent. Even Brazil is rebounding for
American investors. Its Bovespa index is up 57 percent in local
terms and has just moved into the positive category in dollar
terms. Three-quarters of one percentage point is not much, but it's
far better than the more than 29 percent decline the market
rebounded from in January, when the Brazilian currency was
devalued.
</P>
<P>
   In their local currencies, all four markets are above or near
where they were before the Russian debt crisis in August. And when
the performance numbers for the first quarter come out, these and
other markets are going to be at the top of the list, and the
secret will be out.
</P>
<P>
   This rally may not _ and maybe should not _ attract individual
investors right away. Last year, according to AMG Data Services,
investors pulled $4 billion out of emerging market mutual funds and
have withdrawn another $585 million so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   But money managers may have to take a look soon, even if they
don't rush in, just because the returns are so fat.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Pelosky, the global emerging-markets strategist at Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter, argues that managers of global equity funds
should consider returning because the extreme volatility in
emerging markets, which helped lead to major losses the last year
and a half, has begun to decline. In other words, the waters are
less turbulent.
</P>
<P>
   Just this week, he recommended moving more money into Brazil,
pushing the investment there above Brazil's share of the Latin
American market. Earlier this year, he moved to a similar position
in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are still at the cusp of the turn,'' he said, adding that
this year's rallies have so far been propelled by local investors
and some speculative money.
</P>
<P>
   So if these money managers do come back, Pelosky said emerging
markets would get a big boost. That is because this is so-called
nondedicated money _ the money that does not have to be in emerging
markets _ rather than the funds whose mission is to buy stocks
there.
</P>
<P>
   Global money managers, he said, should be looking for value
stocks, the well-run companies whose prices have been beaten down
too far in the indiscriminate flight from Latin America. ``There
are highly qualified companies that have been battle-tested,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, however, he said his clients were still being cautious.
``Some are looking and some are kicking the tires,'' he said.
``Some are buying a little, but not much.''
</P>
<P>
   Many money managers, he said, are still asking ``what kind of
damage can emerging markets do to me, not what kind of
opportunities there are.''
</P>
<P>
   Diego Espinosa, co-manager of the $1.6 billion Scudder Global
Fund, is one of those money managers who is again thinking about
emerging markets. While he is not jumping in at all, he is kicking
the tires, which is a change for him.
</P>
<P>
   What is moving Espinosa is a marked change in the atmosphere in
emerging markets in just the last month and a half, probably best
dated from the appointment of Arminio Fraga Neto, a former manager
of one of George Soros' biggest investment funds, as the new
president of the Brazilian central bank.
</P>
<P>
   From the fear of debt defaults in January, Fraga and the
Brazilian government are now entertaining proposals from American
investment bankers on how to go back to the global bond market to
raise new and needed capital.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico and Argentina have had successful bond sales. And the two
other major Latin American economies have dodged any downdraft from
Brazil, so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``There seems to be some sort of decoupling going on,'' said
Desmond Lachman, director of emerging-markets economic research at
Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stabilized environment has allowed us to look at stocks in
the region on a bottom-up basis,'' Espinosa said. This is a
stock-by- stock approach that is still cautious, looking for
undervalued stocks but precluding any big immediate moves. And he
is still uncomfortable in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Asian financial crisis and the subsequent Russian
financial crisis sent emerging markets reeling, money managers
thought of these markets as a group or, in investment jargon, an
asset class. At that time, getting into emerging markets was buying
the asset class. The choice was being in emerging markets, not
being in a particular stock. Money moved faster that way.
</P>
<P>
   And at that time the emerging- market asset class was thought to
be good for the diversification of a portfolio. Emerging markets
could be generally counted on to be contrarian, so they would go up
when other markets were falling.
</P>
<P>
   But now, Espinosa said, emerging markets seem to be following
the rest of the world's markets, especially when they decline. And
that means there is no diversification benefit in emerging markets,
which had helped offset the higher risk of being in them. ``We have
not got the diversification benefit we expected,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   What would be ideal, Espinosa added, would be to have stronger
worldwide growth, which is always good for emerging stock markets,
and a return to the benefits of diversifying into those markets.
</P>
<P>
   But until then, he will be looking stock by stock, which means
his return may be much slower than Pelosky would hope. &QL;

KETCHUM TAKES ON HOW TO REMAKE ZIPPOS AS SOMETHING OTHER THAN
LIGHTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Pa.)  (af) 
 By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The assignment was not exactly straightforward: create an
advertising campaign that recasts the famous Zippo lighter as
something _ anything _ other than a lighter. And, most importantly,
aim the campaign at young people, but not too young.
</P>
<P>
   Ketchum Advertising Pittsburgh accepted the challenge. Employing
the theme ``Use it to start something,'' an ambitious new campaign
shows Zippos lighting birthday candles, romantic fires on the beach
and even conversations.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not cigarette lighters; they are ignition devices,''
St. Lee James, creative director at Ketchum Advertising Pittsburgh,
part of Omnicom Group, said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   While the lighters could be used to ignite cigarettes, he
acknowledged, ``I like to think of it as portable fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Trying to attract significantly younger buyers _ Zippo's current
customers average 45 years old _ Zippo has introduced a decidedly
irreverent print and television campaign toeing a very fine line
between promoting its lighters and promoting smoking.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a really weird position for me because I don't want to be
advocating cigarette smoking, but people are still going to light
cigarettes with them,'' James said. ``The hope was to find
alternative uses for the product and not link it to cigarette
smoking.''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, the campaign is aimed squarely at 21- to
26-year-olds, a generation perhaps unfamiliar with Zippo's place in
American culture. The Zippo Manufacturing Co., based in Bradford,
Pa., was founded in 1932 and gained notice in World War II when the
lighters became popular among American soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Zippos have become a staple of a community of
collectors. In fact, 21 percent of owners are lighter collectors,
according to the company.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign is estimated to cost $10 million, which is by far
the largest advertising budget ever for the family-owned company.
It began running in the fall and returns next week with a new
series of print, television and outdoor ads.
</P>
<P>
   The push to use humor and sophisticated imagery for Zippo is
meant to convey a new sense of nicotine-free cool. For example, the
print ads include images of a surfer meditating on an exotic beach
encircled by candles and a young couple lying on a couch at a
trendy lounge bar, staring into the flame of the Zippo lighter
seemingly transfixed.
</P>
<P>
   The print ads have appeared or will appear in Details, Detour,
Elle, Entertainment Weekly, Maxim, P.O.V., Premiere, Spin, Rolling
Stone and Vibe magazines.
</P>
<P>
   The television commercials, blending humor with bizarre plot
twists, are aimed directly at the MTV generation. In all four
spots, a fictitious character referred to as ``Zippo Guy'' gets in
trouble using his Zippo in outlandish situations. In one
commercial, he is caught by two farmhands trying to light the
excreted gas from a cow.
</P>
<P>
   ``According to recent studies the ozone layer is rapidly
depleting,'' Zippo Guy is heard saying. ``The main cause for this
phenomenon is the mass release of bovine gases. Igniting these
gases early on will keep them form rising into the ozone.'' He
adds, ``I will save the planet for the ages.`
</P>
<P>
   The commercials have run or are running on the Comedy Central,
ESPN, ESPN2 and MTV cable networks.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Zippo's traditionally older customers, Patrick
Grandy, marketing communications manager for Zippo, said, ``If they
don't get it, that's OK, because it's not a message that was
directed and designed for them in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ``I don't think we're turning them off.''
</P>
<P>
   Other media vehicles for the campaign include radio commercials
that ran in the fall during the Howard Stern syndicated morning
radio show, a Web site (www.zippomfg.com) and postcards aimed at
college students.
</P>
<P>
   Outdoor advertising is being added to the mix with posters to
appear on telephone kiosks throughout Manhattan; Zippo hopes to
expand the posters to include Los Angeles by next fall.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the campaign's mandate not to promote cigarette smoking,
one publication, The Source, a hip-hop magazine for young people,
declined to run the ads after briefly entering into talks with
Zippo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a policy not to accept any liquor or tobacco
advertisements in the magazine,'' said Peter Ferraro, associate
publisher for advertising at The Source.
</P>
<P>
   ``When push came to shove I sat down with the publisher and we
decided not to take it,'' he added, ``because in the end you know
anyone is going to associate a lighter with lighting cigarettes.
And whether they had a surfer lighting candles on the beach or
somebody lighting birthday candles, it was still just a little too
close to comfort for us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our 16- and 18-year-old kids are at an age when they are
making decisions about whether or not to smoke,'' Ferraro said.
``What do you do with a lighter? You know?''

PER DIEMS IN HOUSE MAY BE GOOD, BUT A VOTE ON THEM ISN'T
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif. )   (nk) 
 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ There are few things members of Congress want more
than a raise and little they like less than to be seen voting for
one.
</P>
<P>
   This year Rep. Bill Thomas, R-Calif., chairman of the committee
that sets the rules for expense accounts, began shopping around for
a way to solve the conundrum.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas proposed having his committee change the rules so that
representatives, if they chose to, could pocket a portion of their
expense accounts tax free in the form of a $125 per diem. The
matter would never have to come to a vote.
</P>
<P>
   But The Hill, a weekly newspaper about Congress, got wind of the
plan and published an account of it Wednesday. By the afternoon, it
stood about as much chance of being carried out as a surtax on
comb-overs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This dog ain't going to hunt,'' said a top staff assistant who
had taken soundings on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, who heads the Committee on House Administration, did not
return telephone calls. He issued a statement Wednesday night
saying that his committee would consider the per diem proposal only
if it had the approval of the leadership of both parties, which by
then it clearly did not.
</P>
<P>
   John P. Feehery, a spokesman for Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, said
the speaker had not endorsed the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Nichols, a spokeswoman for Rep. Dick Gephardt, the
Democratic leader, said Gephardt had told the speaker he would
think about the proposal but would support it only if a vote was
allowed.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, Congress thought it had solved the pay problem once and
for all.
</P>
<P>
   Under a measure passed that year, lawmakers became entitled to
an automatic annual raise _ 0.5 percentage points less than the
employment cost index, a measure of inflation that many businesses
use to give their workers cost of living raises.
</P>
<P>
   For a few years, this worked. But almost every year since 1993,
one representative or another has proposed that the raise be
blocked. That required a vote. And except for 1997, the lawmakers
denied themselves the automatic pay increase.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives and senators now make $136,700 a year. They also
get an expense account, or representational allowance, that ranges
from $859,000 to $1.3 million. The money is used for rents and
other office expenses, air fares home and other costs.
</P>
<P>
   The actual amount is based on factors including how far their
district is from Washington and how much it costs to rent office
space in their districts.
</P>
<P>
   Under Thomas' plan, representatives would have been permitted to
dip into this account and pay themselves $125 every day the House
was in session. If the House met 160 days during a year _ an
average of four days a week for 40 weeks _ that would amount to
$20,000.
</P>
<P>
   Per diems are common practice in state legislatures, where
salaries are generally lower. In his statement, Thomas said he had
often been asked by colleagues why the House did not have a similar
allowance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a good question, which is why members of both parties
have discussed this,'' he said.

SKIRT'S THE ISSUE IN THIS COURT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LAURA VOZZELLA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Massie Tillman wants
lawyers who practice before him to come to court prepared and on
time.
</P>
<P>
   And, if they're women, he wants them in skirts.
</P>
<P>
   Tillman, 61, banned female lawyers and witnesses from wearing
pants in courtroom rules that took effect Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women are to wear a dress, skirt and jacket or skirt and
blouse in the courtroom,'' the rules state. ``Women are not to wear
pants or pantsuits.''
</P>
<P>
   Women can sport slacks in nearly every other courtroom in
Tarrant County and in federal courtrooms in North Texas..MDNM/ They
can wear them on the floor of the Texas House and Senate. Ditto for
the federal appeals court in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   The highest court of the land simply requires ``conservative
business dress,'' although no one at the Supreme Court could say if
a woman had ever argued there in slacks.
</P>
<P>
   Tillman, who like most judges requires male attorneys to wear
coats and ties, declined to discuss the policy. But a good bit of
the local bar is buzzing about it. The National Organization
for.MDNM/ Women called the rules ``silly'' and ``old-fashioned.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everyone who says women shouldn't be wearing anything
but skirts for the courtroom, they should just try it for
themselves for a few days and see how they like it,'' said Mollee
Westfall, a felony prosecutor with the Tarrant County District
Attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
   Westfall, who does not appear in Tillman's court, said she has
had to lie down on the floor in some trials to reenact a crime for
a jury. She sometimes must bend over to dig through boxes of
documents, and to pick up bulky evidence, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't exactly take the kinds of positions that you might
be able to in pants,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the matter of comfort in courtrooms, which can
be drafty in winter and overly air-conditioned in summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those courtrooms are set for the comfort level of the judge,
who is in a wool robe,'' said Westfall, who often wears pantsuits,
including a blue wool pinstriped number identical to one her
lawyer/husband wears.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 17 other federal district and bankruptcy judges in the
Northern District of Texas, staff members for 13 said they have no
ban on slacks. At least one district judge, Joe Fish of Dallas, has
told female lawyers not to wear pants, although he has no written
policy on the matter, a staff member said.
</P>
<P>
   Three could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Courtroom dress codes have relaxed considerably from the days
when female jurors were instructed to wear dresses and male jurors
had to wear coats and ties, said U.S. District Judge Eldon Mahon,
who took the bench in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back in the early days, I even loaned my personal coat to a
juror,'' Mahon said.
</P>
<P>
   Mahon, who turns 82 next month, still thinks that dress codes
are needed because court is a formal occasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mean you have to wear a tuxedo, but I do think they
ought to dress very presentably,'' Mahon said.
</P>
<P>
   And.MDNM/ he includes.MDNM/ pants in that category.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no problem with women in a nice slacks suit,'' Mahon
said. ``It's probably more ladylike than these extremely short
skirts.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if judges do not forbid pantsuits, many lawyers still think
they are taboo.
</P>
<P>
   As Supreme Court counsel for the National Association of
Attorneys General, Dan Schweitzer advises to attorneys who will
appear before the high court. Schweitzer said he wouldn't recommend
slacks for women, even though the court's only official demand is
for ``conservative business dress.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor would Schweitzer recommend anything but dark suits and white
shirts for men.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a social question of what we consider to be
conservative dress,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Or rather, what the court considers to be conservative dress.
And judges, he acknowledged, tend to be older, maler and less
sartorially hip than much of America.
</P>
<P>
   For Supreme Court justices and perhaps many judges around the
country, he said, conservative dress means bared gams.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not really on the cutting edge of fashion,'' he said.

AMR PROFITS WORSE THAN EXPECTED BECAUSE OF PILOT SICKOUT 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By   LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The parent of American Airlines, AMR Corp., said Wednesday that
the financial pain caused by the crippling 10-day sickout by its
pilots last month had been worse than expected and that its
first-quarter profit would be about half of Wall Street's current
estimate.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement, which came after the close of the New York
Stock Exchange, sent AMR shares lower in after-hours trading, from
a close of $59.0625 to $57.50; they rose later to $58.
</P>
<P>
   AMR said the sickout, which forced American to cancel more than
6,600 flights, would reduce its sales by an estimated $200 million
to $225 million in the first quarter. The company had previously
estimated the effect of the protest at $150 million.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had used that figure to reduce their estimates of
first-quarter earnings to 65 cents a share from about $1.10. AMR
said Wednesday that it would earn 30 to 35 cents in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Gerard J. Arpey, AMR's chief financial officer, said in a
statement that the sickout caused American, the nation's
second-largest airline, to lose a greater number of high-paying
business travelers than the airline had thought and that it had
also encouraged a greater number of potential passengers to book
their future travel on other airlines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, a quarter that looked like it would come in
generally in line with analyst expectations has been dramatically
impacted by the job action,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To soften the blow, AMR also announced Wednesday that its board
had authorized the company to buy back an additional $500 million
worth of its stock. The company said it expected to complete a
previous $500 million stock buyback by the end of the first
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The news caused some airline analysts to wonder whether
American's unexpected pain was responsible for the unexpected gains
recently announced at other airlines. On Monday, UAL Corp., the
parent of United Airlines, said it would surpass analysts'
estimates for the first quarter by 23 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Airline revenue has been down in recent months in what some
analysts think is the beginning of the end of four years of record
profits for the industry.
</P>
<P>
   United, which is the nation's largest airline, said its earnings
were a result of not just the sickout at American but also strong
domestic bookings that it said signaled a ``reversal in the decline
in domestic revenue strength.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Samuel Buttrick, an analyst at Paine Webber in New
York, now estimates United's one-time benefit from the American
sickout to be 28 cents a share, more than the gain UAL is
predicting for the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The greater the impact at American, the greater the
nonrecurring benefit at other carriers,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   American and its pilots have been at odds over AMR's recent
purchase of Reno Air, a small carrier that operates mostly in the
West. The Allied Pilots Association, the union representing
American's 9,200 pilots, contends that the Reno purchase, which was
completed in December, violates a guarantee in their contract that
their members do all the flying at American and other AMR
subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
   AMR has said that it plans to integrate Reno's 300 pilots into
American's larger network but that it will take as long as 18
months. The union wants the Reno pilots to be paid under the more
beneficial terms in their contact immediately.
</P>
<P>
   After negotiations between the company and the union failed to
resolve the issue, some pilots began calling in sick in early
February. The protest grew to the point that on one day American
had to cancel about half of its 2,250 daily flights. After a
federal judge petitioned by AMR ordered the pilots back to work and
threatened to fine them more than $10 million, the union and the
company agreed to mediation, but the dispute is still not resolved.
</P>
<P>
   In a message to employees last week, Donald J. Carty, chairman
and chief executive of AMR, said American planned to expand more
slowly. He also said it would try to reduce its dependence on its
pilots by decreasing the amount of overtime flying built into the
airline's schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's simply not fair to anybody,'' he said. ``to continue our
reliance on a resource that has become less than predictable.'' &QL;

GERMAN CONCERN TO BUY EASTMAN KODAK'S COPIER BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y.)  (af) 
 By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eastman Kodak Co., which has long viewed its copier business as
a liability, announced Wednesday that it would sell most of its
copier manufacturing operations to Heidelberger Druckmaschinen AG
of Germany
</P>
<P>
   It also said it would transfer toner manufacturing and various
patents and intellectual property to Nexpress, a joint venture it
formed with Heidelberger, a $4 billion printing company, in late
1997.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the announcement, which was reported Wednesday by
The Wall Street Journal, is no coincidence. Thursday, at a trade
show in Hanover, Germany, Kodak will introduce its Digisource 9110,
a digital copier that can produce 110 pages a minute, making it the
first copier fast enough to compete with the Xerox Corp.'s
highest-end products. Most analysts suspect that it was the
Digisource, which will carry the Kodak name for at least another
year, that lured Heidelberger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without this product, Kodak could never have made the sale,''
said Gary Schneider, an analyst at Bear, Stearns &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Financially, the deal will not have much impact on Kodak. Its
office imaging business barely broke even on about $450 million in
revenues last year. It lost money in the fourth quarter, in good
part because Danka Business Systems, the ailing distributor that
bought Kodak's copier sales and service operations in 1996, had
fallen behind on payments for Kodak equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Kodak, the deal means getting rid of a small per-share
loss,'' said Jack L. Kelly, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Kodak will get $100 million cash from Heidelberger, while it
will transfer about $100 million worth of assets to the joint
venture.
</P>
<P>
   Kodak's stock inched up 43.75 cents Wednesday, closing at
$68.125, but few analysts believed this deal was behind the rise.
``All this really did was eliminate a big headache for Kodak,''
said Peter J. Enderlin, an analyst with First Albany Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The impact on Heidelberger, Danka and Xerox may be greater. The
Digisource could provide a vital strategic cog for Heidelberger,
which faces a challenge from the growing number of customers who
use high-speed copiers to print manuals, brochures and other items
that were once the purview of the offset printers that Heidelberger
makes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gives Heidelberger its first alternative to offset
printing,'' said Ulysses Yannas, an analyst with Mercer, Bokert,
Buckman &AMP; Reid.
</P>
<P>
   For Danka, the blessing is mixed. It loses its exclusive
distribution rights to Kodak copiers. Mark Weber, a Kodak vice
president of office imaging, said three other distributors had
signed on to sell the Digisource, and a fourth was close.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Danka's president, Brian L. Merriman, called the deal
``wonderful for us.'' He said potential copier customers balked
because they knew Kodak wanted to leave the copier market, and that
having the Heidelberger name in place would allay their fears. And
he said that Danka's employees are already trained to sell and
service the Digisource, giving Danka at least a three-month head
start on any rival.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may not have contractual exclusivity, but we have
functional exclusivity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The deal could pose problems for Xerox, which has until now
owned the market for high-speed digital copiers. Still, Xerox
insists it is not worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been working on this product line for nearly 10 years,
and our sales and service people understand it fully,'' said
Christa Carone, a Xerox spokeswoman. ``Our ears are perked up,
we're monitoring the situation, but we're not going to let anyone
overtake us.'' &QL;

VITAMIN O PRODUCTS ARE FRAUD, AGENCY SAYS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash.)   (nk) 
 By DENISE GRADY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission has accused two companies of
bottling salt water, labeling it ``Vitamin O'' and selling it as a
dietary supplement for $10 an ounce. The agency said the companies
claimed that the product would treat cancer, high blood pressure,
lung disease, headaches, infections, colds, flu and other ailments.
</P>
<P>
   In advertisements in USA Today and other newspapers, and on the
Internet, the companies _ Rose Creek Health Products Inc. and The
Staff of Life Inc., in Kettle Falls, Wash. _ have asserted that
their product ``purifies your bloodstream, maximizes nutrients,
eliminates poisons and toxins.''
</P>
<P>
   A testimonial on the companies' Web site, supposedly from
someone with lung cancer, emphysema and heart disease, states:
``Three days after starting the Vitamin O, I threw my cane away. In
November, we went to Arizona and I bought myself a bicycle.''
</P>
<P>
   Another testimonial, describing a man who had been suffering
severe headaches for 20 years, says, ``The day he began taking
Vitamin O his headaches disappeared.''
</P>
<P>
   The company also says that its product was used by American
astronauts in space missions.
</P>
<P>
   In a complaint filed on March 11 in Federal District Court in
Spokane, Wash., the trade commission asserted that these claims
were false and charged the two companies, both owned by Donald L.
Smyth, with making false and unsubstantiated health claims.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the companies' public relations office said
Smyth was not available for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike drugs, products marketed as dietary supplements can be
sold without the approval of the Food and Drug Administration. But
the trade commission can move against companies that market these
products, if it believes their advertising is misleading or
deceptive.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Winston, assistant director of the division of advertising
practices at the trade commission, said: ``One of the things that
makes this case of great significance to us is that they ran full-
and half-page ads in USA Today. This is not the back pages of some
alternative medicine journal or late-night cable TV. Ads like this
should not be running in mainstream publications like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Dewar, director of advertising operations for USA Today,
said, ``We screen our ads, as any newspaper does.'' He declined
further comment.
</P>
<P>
   The trade commission's complaint against the Vitamin O
manufacturers, which will be presented at a hearing on April 7,
asks for a preliminary injunction to halt the false advertising. If
that request is granted, the commission will then seek to make the
injunction permanent and ultimately to make the companies pay court
costs, refund consumers' money and give up ``ill-gotten'' profits.
</P>
<P>
   The ``O'' stands for oxygen, which the product purports to
deliver to cells and tissues. But Winston said the product had been
analyzed by the FDA and found to contain nothing but salt water.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company claims it's salt water into which they have
introduced something they call stabilized oxygen,'' Winston said,
but he noted that scientists who searched the scientific literature
to find out about stabilized oxygen could not find a single
reference to it.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the product did contain high levels of dissolved oxygen,
a notion that chemists dismiss, it would be of no medicinal use.
Winston said medical experts consulted by the trade commission had
pointed out that people could not absorb oxygen by drinking water
containing it. Only fish and other animals with gills can do that.
</P>
<P>
   Winston said officials at the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration said Vitamin O had never been given to astronauts.
The trade commission tried to track down the scientist who had
supposedly developed it for NASA, but, Winston said, ``we have not
been able to confirm his existence.''

AIRBUS WON'T BE TRANSFORMED THIS YEAR, FINANCE CHIEF SAYS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By   LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Airbus Industrie, the passenger jet consortium jointly owned by
four European companies, will not transform itself into a single
corporation this year, its chief financial officer said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus had planned to complete the transition from a relatively
loose partnership to a private company by January. But bickering
among its partners _ Aerospatiale of France, DaimlerChrysler
Aerospace AG of Germany, British Aerospace and Construcciones
Aeronauticas SA of Spain, known as CASA _ over the value of their
stakes in a unified company has delayed the move indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is going to be a mighty negotiation before it is done,''
Ian Massey, financial controller of the consortium, said after
addressing Wall Street analysts in New York Wednesday. ``I don't
have a sense of how it is going to play out.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year was the strongest for Airbus since its founding in
1970. The consortium delivered 229 airplanes, for a total of $13.3
billion in revenue, a 26 percent increase over 1997. Airbus now
offers a broad family of airplanes, from 100-seat single-aisle jets
to 400-passenger wide bodies, and it is near its goal of splitting
the market for new orders with its rival, the Boeing Co.
</P>
<P>
   But Massey said that unless it altered its structure, Airbus
would have a harder time cutting its costs and building a proposed
new super jumbo jet capable of carrying up to 1,000 passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Aerospatiale and DaimlerChrysler each own 37.9 percent of the
consortium; British Aerospace owns 20 percent, and CASA owns 4.2
percent. Each partner produces different parts for the Airbus
planes, which are assembled in Toulouse, France. In this odd
arrangement, each partner earned money as Airbus subcontractors
last year while the consortium itself lost money.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus engaged in a bruising price war with Boeing in recent
years that has hurt both. After suffering costly production
foul-ups as it increased production in 1997, Boeing is now
struggling to cut costs so that planes ordered at rock-bottom
prices two and three years ago but not yet delivered will yield
more profits.
</P>
<P>
   Massey said Airbus faced the same problem. It plans to deliver
295 airplanes this year, a 29 percent increase over 1998, for
revenue of $16 billion. But many of these jets were ordered by
airlines in 1996 and 1997, at the height of the price war with
Boeing, and they are being built at a time when Airbus cost
reductions are leveling off.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   John J. Leahy, Airbus senior vice president in charge of sales,
said the consortium was able to command higher prices for its
airplanes in recent months as Boeing has focused on increasing its
financial return. Massey added that the market in Asia, which
accounted for only 3 percent of Airbus sales last year, was also
beginning to turn around.
</P>
<P>
   The two men reiterated a commitment by Airbus to build the A3XX,
a super jumbo jet that will cost upward of $10 billion to develop.
Earlier this year, Airbus announced that it was pushing back the
introduction of the plane by one year, to 2005, because many Asian
carriers were still not ready to place orders.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing, which has a monopoly on planes carrying more than 400
passengers with its 747, says demand for a new jumbo does not
justify its cost. But Airbus has been consulting 19 airlines on the
design of the plane, including Federal Express, which has agreed to
be the first customer for a freighter version of the four-engine
jet.
</P>
<P>
   Unless Airbus has the A3XX, it says, Boeing will have the entire
market for large planes to itself. Massey predicted that $300
billion, or 26 percent, of the industry's overall sales in the next
20 years would be planes with more than 400 seats. That, he said,
is a slice too big to ignore.

HARRY CALLAHAN, 86, DISTINGUISHED PHOTOGRAPHER

(mk) 
 By ANDY GRUNDBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Harry Callahan, a photographer whose pictures married the
elegant precision of American modernists like Ansel Adams with the
restless experimental spirit of European modernists like Laszlo
Moholy-Nagy, died on Monday at his home in Atlanta. He was 86.
</P>
<P>
   Callahan was something of a diamond in the rough, having come to
photography with no formal training in the arts. Nevertheless, in a
career that spanned more than 50 years, he produced some of this
century's most complex and sophisticated photographs.
</P>
<P>
   He also was enormously influential as a teacher, at the
Institute of Design in Chicago and the Rhode Island School of
Design in Providence. Reticent, and uncomfortable when talking
about the meaning of photographs in critical terms, he taught
primarily by example. His legendary dedication to craft and camera
work set the standard for a younger generation of photographers who
combined, like their mentor, simultaneous careers as artists and
teachers. ``I sort of wish sometimes that I had cared about
something else, but I haven't,'' Callahan once said. ``My whole
drive has been to take pictures. It's the only thing I have ever
been good at.''
</P>
<P>
   John Szarkowski, former director of photography at the Museum of
Modern Art in New York, once described Callahan's approach as ``not
to bend photography to his purposes, but rather to immerse himself
in its will _ to make himself its instrument and servant.''
</P>
<P>
   Szarkowski organized a retrospective exhibition of Callahan's
work at the Modern in 1976. Callahan also represented the United
States in the Venice Biennale in 1978 with the painter Richard
Diebenkorn.
</P>
<P>
   Callahan's photographs are marked both by his interest in the
formal properties of the medium and by a beguiling sense of
emotional intimacy. He often emphasized the extremes of the tonal
scale, preferring near-black and near-white to middle tones of
gray, and he experimented with multiple exposures, motion and other
techniques that caused his pictures to stray from a purely factual
rendition of the world.
</P>
<P>
   His favorite subject, other than light itself, was his wife,
Eleanor, whose face and whose figure, clothed or often nude, appear
in scores of his best photographs. He also photographed city
streets and pedestrians in Chicago, where he lived from 1946 to
1961, as well as weeds, telephone wires, beaches and the
skyscrapers of New York _ all with the aim of revealing the graphic
beauty residing in ordinary, often overlooked objects or passages
of daily life.
</P>
<P>
   A comparison of two of his early pictures, ``Detroit, 1941'' and
``Sunlight on Water, 1943,'' illustrates the artistic versatility
and resourcefulness that Callahan exhibited throughout his career.
In the former, reeds stick out of a nearly white pond like black
strokes of ink; in the latter, the water forms a black ground on
which bright white circles of sunlight play. In essence, the two
pictures are opposite sides of the same calligraphic coin.
</P>
<P>
   His much-admired photographs of his wife range from an extreme,
high-key close-up of her face and arms, ``Eleanor, 1947,'' to a
dune-covered landscape, ``Eleanor, Indiana, 1948'' _ in which she
appears, arms crossed above her head, only as a small dark speck in
the distance. One of his better-known pictures, ``Eleanor, Chicago,
1949,'' is a close-up of his wife's head rising from the lake, the
whiteness of her strong face contrasting with her long black hair
trailing in the water.
</P>
<P>
   Influenced partly by the climate of experimentation that
prevailed at the Institute of Design, which Moholy-Nagy had founded
in 1937 as a new Bauhaus in the United States, Callahan developed a
repertory of techniques that became the cornerstones of his readily
recognizable style. In one series, he double-exposed his film but
rotated it 180 degrees between exposures, producing vertiginous
visual puzzles. In a related series, he made exposures in the
landscape and re-exposed the undeveloped film indoors to
superimpose the scene with the nude body of his wife. In the early
1950s he also experimented with color slide films, which had
recently been introduced by Eastman Kodak.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike Moholy-Nagy, who died in 1946 soon after Callahan
arrived to teach, he never believed that formal experimentation was
an end in itself. Instead, he subscribed to the notion that the
camera was a tool of personal revelation and expression, and all
his experiments with the formal potentials of his medium bear the
marks of a singular sensibility.
</P>
<P>
   Callahan became a teacher of photography after World War II,
when interest in the artistic potentials of the medium was
increasing exponentially. Together with Aaron Siskind, with whom he
taught at both the Institute of Design in Chicago and the Rhode
Island School of Design, he trained a generation of photographic
artists and teachers who filled the demand for teachers of
photography in the 1960s and '70s on the college level.
</P>
<P>
   As a teacher Callahan preferred to let students learn by looking
closely at their own and one another's pictures as well as by
letting them see his latest work in its formative, uncertain
stages. The process of discovery via the camera was what interested
him most. ``Photography is an adventure just as life is an
adventure,'' Callahan once said, adding that an artist necessarily
came to understand the two in tandem.
</P>
<P>
   His students, of whom Linda Connor, Emmet Gowin, Joseph Jachna,
Kenneth Josephson, Ray K. Metzker and Art Sinsabaugh are among the
best known, have often cited his work ethic and dedication to the
fine print as major influences on their careers. He disdained the
temptations (including the income) of magazine and advertising work
and he was able to pursue his own work even while maintaining a
heavy teaching load.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Harry Morey Callahan was born in Detroit on Oct. 22, 1912, the
son of Harry Arthur Callahan, a farmer, and his wife, the former
Hazel Mills. He attended Michigan State University as an
engineering major, but dropped out and did odd jobs to support
himself. He met Eleanor Knapp on a blind date and married her in
1936. He first took up the camera in 1938 while working as a clerk
for Chrysler Motors in Detroit, teaching himself the rudiments on a
Rolleicord. In 1941 he attended a workshop by Ansel Adams at the
Detroit Photo Guild; it was an encounter that profoundly affected
his photographic style and his ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   Callahan was impressed not only with the indelible technical
quality of Adams' Western landscapes but also the older artist's
unshakable belief in the idea that photography was a form of art.
As a result he switched to an 8-by-10 view camera, like that used
by Adams, and began to concentrate his attention on recording tones
of light and shadow, rather than merely subject matter.
</P>
<P>
   Years later he recalled being impressed by some of Adams'
pictures of ordinary ground, which indicated to him that anything _
not just spectacular landscapes _ was an appropriate subject for
photographs. ``That was probably the most freeing thing that ever
happened to me,'' he said in 1982. ``From then on, even though I
hadn't made a picture, I thought I was a great artist.''
</P>
<P>
   After working in the photo processing laboratory of General
Motors for two years, Callahan was hired in 1946 to teach at the
Institute of Design, which Moholy-Nagy, a former teacher at the
Bauhaus, had founded in Chicago after emigrating from Europe. The
school's mission was to train designers and architects, but
Moholy-Nagy included photography in the curriculum as a means of
studying light, which he believed an essential element of design.
Callahan was not the first to teach photography at the school, but
he became the dominant figure in the photography curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   In 1949 Callahan became head of the Institute of Design's
photography department, a position he held until 1961. He added
Aaron Siskind to the Institute's photography faculty in 1951, and
together they started a graduate program that served as a model for
scores of similar programs throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   Modifying the original Bauhaus-inspired curriculum, Callahan
injected the possibility of personal expression and subjectivity
into a learning method that previously had prized experimentation
as the means to a purely objective vision. In his own art, the
penchant for experimentation remained inseparable from the
individuality of his style, in which photographic description often
seemed to resemble that of drawing.
</P>
<P>
   At the Rhode Island School of Design, where he was chairman of
the photography department from 1961 to 1973, Callahan continued to
inspire students with his workmanlike attitude and devotion to
graphic discovery. He revisited techniques that had inspired him
two decades earlier like in-camera multiple exposures, and he
expanded his range to include pictures of Colonial row houses in
Providence, R.I., and empty beaches on Cape Cod, Mass. He retired
from teaching in 1977, at 65, turning the school's photography
program over to his lifelong colleague, Siskind.
</P>
<P>
   He stayed in Providence for 10 more years, then moved with his
wife to Atlanta. She survives him, along with their daughter,
Barbara Hollinger, and two grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Retirement from teaching freed Callahan to expand the parameters
of his work. In addition to traveling to Ireland and South America
to take pictures, he renewed his interest in color photography. A
1980 book, ``Harry Callahan: Color,'' revealed the extent of his
earlier work in color as well as his skill in using newer, more
faithful color materials. His work began to be widely exhibited and
collected at the close of his teaching career.
</P>
<P>
   Callahan's work was shown frequently at the Museum of Modern Art
during his lifetime, including exhibitions in 1951, 1962 (with
Robert Frank) and 1968 as well as the 1976 retrospective. His
photographs have also been featured in exhibitions at the Art
Institute of Chicago, the George Eastman House in Rochester, N.Y.,
the Minneapolis Institute of Arts and the National Gallery of Art
in Washington. In the 1970s his work was shown and sold by Light
Gallery, and after that by Pace Wildenstein MacGill.
</P>
<P>
   Other books of Callahan's photographs include ``Callahan''
(Aperture, 1976); ``Eleanor'' (Callaway, 1984), and ``Harry
Callahan: New Color, Photographs 1978-1987'' (Hallmark, 1988).
</P>
<P>
   His obsessive interest in light, line and space and their
interplay drove him to photograph one subject at a time
exhaustively. ``I experiment with various techniques,'' he once
explained,'' to help me see things differently from the way I saw
them before. That is seeing photographically, and when you see
photographically you really see.''

   WASHINGTON _ For an American conductor like Leonard Slatkin, it
would seem to be a seller's market. The major American orchestras
are exhorted these days to get in tune with the times and in touch
with the nation, and in those regards, Slatkin could be a quick
fix: a champion of many current composers and a century's worth of
American music as well as a respected interpreter of standard
repertory.

   Conductors are being courted to replace the lame-duck German
music directors of the New York Philharmonic and the Philadelphia
and Cleveland Orchestras, to name just the most prominent ensembles
with vacancies looming, and Slatkin, with an established reputation
as an orchestra builder at the St. Louis Symphony and a growing one
here at the National Symphony, should be a contender.
</P>
<P>
   Yet to hear him tell it, the orchestras are not buying, and he
would not in any case be selling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's to say we're not happy where we are?'' he said of
himself and a like-minded colleague at another orchestra of the
``second'' rank, Michael Tilson Thomas at the San Francisco
Symphony. ``Not that I wouldn't be flattered if they asked, but
there is no reason for anybody to assume that I wouldn't be happy
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Slatkin, who is 54, still young for a conductor, took over the
National Symphony in 1996, two years after the departure of
Mstislav Rostropovich, on a three-year contract, which he says he
is about to renew. He spoke recently at the Kennedy Center for the
Performing Arts after an arduous rehearsal of John Corigliano's
``Dylan Thomas Trilogy,'' which the orchestra will present on
Friday at Carnegie Hall in the second of two programs consisting
entirely of New York premieres.
</P>
<P>
   The earlier program, on Thursday, also offers typical Slatkin
fare: William Bolcom's Sixth Symphony, Ellen Taaffe Zwilich's
``Images'' and Elgar's unfinished Third Symphony, in an elaboration
by Anthony Payne.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are very risky programs,'' Slatkin said. ``I know,
because Carnegie won't let us do it next year.''
</P>
<P>
   His New York appearances come on the heels of two impressive
Carnegie concerts by his alma mater, the St. Louis Symphony. When
Slatkin left it for the National Symphony, many were puzzled.
Despite the greater prominence he could enjoy in Washington as a
public figure, a role he seemed to relish, musically the move
seemed a step sideways if not down, from an orchestra perennially
on the verge of a major breakthrough to one firmly ensconced in the
second rank.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, a breakthrough to what? The Big Five of American
orchestras (comprising, with New York, Philadelphia and Cleveland,
the Chicago and Boston Symphony Orchestras) is either a permanently
closed club or a hopelessly outmoded concept. In fact, Time
magazine's declaration in 1983 that the St. Louis Symphony was the
second-best orchestra in the country (to the Chicago Symphony) may
have gained it an asterisk but scarcely dented the notion of the
Big Five in the popular imagination.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Big Five comes from an era in American life when there
were only eight major-league baseball teams,'' said Don Roth, who
became president of the St. Louis Symphony last year. ``If there
were only five top orchestras in the country, we really
(italics)would(end italics) be in bad shape.''
</P>
<P>
   It is certainly true that on a given evening the St. Louis, like
the Los Angeles Philharmonic and the San Francisco, Pittsburgh and
Baltimore Symphony Orchestras, can perform on a par with most of
the great ensembles in the world. Some maintain that the top
American orchestras more properly form a cluster of 10 or 12, and
in fact, a group of managers of leading orchestras meets
periodically under the rubric ``The 10'' and now has 11 members.
</P>
<P>
   The St. Louis Symphony gained a reputation of another sort
during the Slatkin years, one surely more valuable in the long run,
as an innovator in establishing ties to the community. It undertook
major initiatives in education, audience development and service to
the city with, among other things, its own music school.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all this, Slatkin explains, even before he learned of an
opportunity in Washington, he had decided it was time for a change,
time to leave St. Louis. He was music director of the orchestra for
17 years, beginning in 1979, having spent much of the previous
decade as its assistant or associate conductor. And he was given
most of the credit for restoring the orchestra, the nation's
second-oldest, to a position at or near the top of American
ensembles.
</P>
<P>
   With Slatkin's departure, the St. Louis Symphony reverted to
typical American form in 1996, hiring a European, the Dutchman Hans
Vonk, just as the Baltimore Symphony has since done, replacing the
American David Zinman with the Russian Yuri Temirkanov as of next
season.
</P>
<P>
   Such moves are undoubtedly intended at least in part to redress
the balance, to nurture more standard areas of repertory after an
astringent period of adventure. In Slatkin's case, his
interpretations of the Germanic canon may be easier to respect than
to warm to and love, and questions are often raised about the depth
of his inspiration in such music.
</P>
<P>
   Vonk, speaking recently after an arduous rehearsal of his own,
in works of Messiaen at Carnegie Hall, cited American music _
second only to Dvorak, of all things _ as repertory he is
(italics)not(end italics_ good at. But he is a seasoned interpreter
of standard fare, and he pointed to versatility as his prime
strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Holland we do everything, German, French, new music,
original instruments,'' he said. ``It's a very lively scene,
without a real specialty.''
</P>
<P>
   Vonk is enamored of the St. Louis Symphony's own versatility
and, still more, its spirit and morale. ``It is the friendliest
orchestra in the world,'' he said. ``They are nice, open people,
very disciplined, with a wonderful approach to music.'' It is also
a relatively young orchestra, hired in large part by Slatkin.
</P>
<P>
   In this case and others, American orchestras' tendency to hire
foreign music directors creates at least small vacuums, which are
themselves opportunities for Slatkin and his ilk. Vonk welcomes
Slatkin back as conductor laureate to keep his specialties alive.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Slatkin already works for both the New York
Philharmonic, where he has covered much of the American repertory
in regular visits as guest conductor during Kurt Masur's tenure,
and the Cleveland Orchestra, where he directs the summer festival
at the Blossom Music Center, injecting some of his own tastes and
emphases.

FROM SNUBBED TO SWEET IN SPOKANE

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ This was not about the West Coast Conference
championship. It was not about beating Minnesota or Stanford. It's
not about Florida, tonight's opponent, or No.1 seed Connecticut,
which looms as the last obstacle before the Final Four
</P>
<P>
   No, this is about sticking it to nine men in a Kansas City hotel
who welcomed Florida State to the NCAA Tournament last March and
tossed Gonzaga into the at-large trash.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were sitting there feeling good about our season,'' Gonzaga
forward Casey Calvary said. ``Then they pushed us out of what we
had earned. This is payback. The NCAA (selection committee) didn't
believe in us, and the NIT didn't believe in us. Nobody believed in
us. But we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Everything Gonzaga (27-6) is today _ angry, bitter, confident, a
No.10 seed with an attitude _ it became on Selection Sunday '98.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in jeans and T-shirts, the Bulldogs gathered in coach
Dan Monson's Spokane basement to watch their name appear in the
64-team field. Sure, they had fumbled away the WCC's automatic bid
with a loss to San Francisco in the league tournament. But their
record (23-9) and non-conference wins (Tulsa, Mississippi State and
Clemson) were definitely good enough for an at-large berth.
</P>
<P>
   Or so they thought. When their name did not appear, there was
silence in the basement. Not anger, not yet, just stunned silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the first time I didn't have an answer for them,''
Monson said. ``I didn't know what to tell them. I didn't know why
we weren't invited. It was a tough moment for me, and it's been a
tremendous responsibility for me to get them (into the tournament)
this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Monson immediately took steps to prevent it from happening
again. First, he upgraded the Bulldogs' schedule.
</P>
<P>
   They opened the season at Kansas and led midway through the
second half before faltering. They entered the preseason NIT and
played at Memphis and at Purdue. They played in the Hawkeye
Invitational in Ames, Iowa, where they lost by one point to Detroit
_ UCLA's Detroit _ and beat South Alabama. They played Washington
State and Washington and Boise State and won all three.
</P>
<P>
   After experiencing Purdue's Mackey Arena and Kansas' Allen
Fieldhouse, the Bulldogs had no fear facing Stanford in Seattle
last weekend in a second-round showdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had no doubt we were going to win that game,'' Calvary
said. ``We're confident. Hey, we're 3-0 against the Pac-10 this
season.''
</P>
<P>
   Monson didn't stop with the schedule. To get his best five on
the floor, he inserted 5-foot-8 point guard Quentin Hall into the
lineup and moved junior Matt Santangelo, his best player, from
point guard to shooting guard. Santangelo struggled throughout the
season _ his shooting dropped from 43.5 percent to 38.7 percent _
and quietly fretted the move would hurt his NBA chances.
</P>
<P>
   Santangelo's struggles didn't stop Gonzaga, didn't even slow it
down. With Monson's coaching, with their relentless attack and the
all-around skills of Calvary (9.3 ppg), Richie Frahm (14.5) and
Jeremy Eaton (11.9), the Bulldogs rolled through the WCC with just
two defeats.
</P>
<P>
   When the conference tournament arrived, Santangelo took charge.
He had 23 assists and 61 points in three games, including a
34-point masterpiece as Gonzaga beat Santa Clara 91-66 in the title
game to secure the coveted automatic berth.
</P>
<P>
   The ensuing celebration was 51 weeks in the making.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always reminded them of last season,'' Monson said. ``I
wanted the pain to be with them. When practices didn't go well, I'd
say, `Do you want to go to Laramie to play Wyoming in the NIT?' And
right away, they'd refocus. It was the same focus they had on
Selection Sunday last year when we didn't get in.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida better be ready. This is no ordinary 10th seed.
</P>
<P>
   Coaching roulette: Monson apparently considers Washington State
a dead-end position and will not replace departed coach Kevin
Eastman. Smart move. Monson has most of his best players back next
year and should be in line for a better job.
</P>
<P>
   Watch for former Arizona State interim coach Don Newman to get
the Wazu gig. He was an assistant there under Kelvin Sampson.
</P>
<P>
   Monson is a candidate for the San Diego State opening behind
Utah's Rick Majerus, who won't take it, and former St. John's coach
Fran Fraschilla, who will. Majerus, a practicing Catholic, may end
up at Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   Vanderbilt is pursuing Washington coach Bob Bender, who is
respected and well-liked but may be sensing it's time to leave
Seattle. The Huskies underachieved this season and lost their
stars, Todd MacCulloch and Donald Watts.
</P>
<P>
   If Bender leaves, watch for Washington to put Colorado State's
Ritchie McKay and Pepperdine's Lorenzo Romar on its short list.
After the Rick Neuheisel fiasco, the pressure's on athletic
director Barbara Hedges.
</P>
<P>
   Death, taxes and corruption at UNLV: It's tough to keep anything
clean in Sin City, and Billy Bayno may be the latest coach to
collapse under the sleaze that envelops the Nevada-Las Vegas
program.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA's enforcement staff arrived on campus Wednesday to
investigate allegations of recruiting violations and extra
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Sources told the Las Vegas Sun that the NCAA will interview four
players, including star forward Shawn Marion, and assistant coach
Greg Vetrone. According to a Las Vegas television station, an
assistant coach allegedly gave a student manager money to make car
payments for former player (and current Clipper) Tyrone Nesby.
</P>
<P>
   If true, the violations could give UNLV reason to dismiss Bayno,
who is neither popular nor successful. He'd join his former boss at
Massachusetts, John Calipari, on the unemployed list.

 WASHINGTON: and emphases.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   These roles, serving both parties, may obviate the need for a
permanent affiliation. The Cleveland connection, in particular,
seems to have had a formative influence on Slatkin in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Coming from St. Louis's Powell Hall, a converted movie theater
with acclaimed acoustics, he expressed the wish (not, he insists,
the demand, as has been reported) early on at the National Symphony
for an acoustical renovation of the Kennedy Center Concert Hall.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to presenting uneven and erratic sound to listeners,
the old acoustics prevented the players from hearing one another on
stage, thus threatening to hold back the orchestra's progress.
</P>
<P>
   Powell Hall, with its rich, reverberant acoustics, Slatkin says,
showed him the extent to which an orchestra derives its sound from
its home. The lesson has been reinforced by his experience with the
Cleveland Orchestra, which developed its elegant precision partly
in response to the dry, detailed acoustics of Severance Hall in
Cleveland (itself now under renovation) and carries it along even
to outdoor concerts at Blossom.
</P>
<P>
   By the time of the Kennedy Center Concert Hall renovation, which
was undertaken for other reasons as well as acoustical ones and
completed before last season, Slatkin's sound ideal had evolved to
favor greater clarity, he says, largely on the basis of the
Cleveland Orchestra experience. So would it be accurate to describe
the sound he is seeking at the National Symphony as basically the
plush, dark St. Louis sound with an overlay of Cleveland clarity?
</P>
<P>
   ``You could say that,'' he said. ``Or you could call it the
sound of the Boston Symphony in the Monteux years, or the Chicago
Symphony in the Reiner years.'' If the National Symphony fails to
reach the top in the days ahead, it will not be for lack of
ambition.
</P>
<P>
   And the orchestra seems indeed to be headed in the right
direction, to judge from a rehearsal and performance of the big,
burly Corigliano piece. Between the beneficial effects of the hall
renovation and Slatkin's furtherance of his sound ideal, there is
little question that the quality of its playing has improved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Slava was known for his interpretations of Tchaikovsky and
Shostakovich, and we played like a Russian orchestra, with a lot of
extremes,'' David Bragunier, the orchestra's tuba player and
personnel manager, said of its 17 years with Rostropovich. ``I'm
not sure anyone ever played louder than us. Or softer. Some
listeners must have found us harsh. Leonard is going for a new,
full, blended, darker sound, a Bruckner sound, perhaps.''
</P>
<P>
   Rostropovich left in 1994, and once he had announced his
decision to do so, in 1992, he generously left vacancies in the
orchestra to be filled by his successor. As a result, Slatkin has
already had the opportunity to hire 14 of the orchestra's 100
players. It, too, is a young ensemble, and one that Slatkin calls
friendly, eager and disciplined. He deals with the players on a
slightly more formal basis than in St. Louis, where many musicians
had known him virtually from childhood.
</P>
<P>
   Slatkin's programming ideas obviously make greater demands on
the National Symphony players than those many orchestras face. ``We
have so much literature to deal with here,'' Bragunier said. ``But
Leonard is extremely quick, and we can do it, though it does get a
little hectic at times.''
</P>
<P>
   Audiences, too, seem receptive to Slatkin's proclivities.
Subscriptions are up to 76 percent of capacity, from ``the 60s''
before Slatkin arrived, said Robert C. Jones, the orchestra's
president. Overall seat occupancy is expected to rise from 88
percent last season to 90 percent this season, he added.
</P>
<P>
   (The St. Louis Symphony, Roth said, is filling about 70 percent
of capacity, essentially the same as during the Slatkin years.) And
some of the most clamorous ovations are reserved for the most
challenging pieces.
</P>
<P>
   The National Symphony gives Slatkin scope for his interests in
community relations and, especially, education, not only locally
but also nationally. Before his arrival the orchestra had a series
of ``American Residencies'' in place. Next month Slatkin leads a
10-day residency in Mississippi, with some 150 events presented in
Biloxi, Cleveland, Jackson, Tupelo and other cities and towns.
</P>
<P>
   And yes, he does have access to the corridors of power. ``I know
politicians on a social basis,'' said Slatkin who lives in Potomac,
Md., with his wife, Linda Hohenfeld, and their son, Daniel. ``I
haven't used this as a political forum, but I try to keep the issue
of music education in the schools alive.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there are the surprises: ``Newt Gingrich was a very
interesting person to know and a great supporter of the Kennedy
Center,'' Slatkin said. ``Sometimes you get fooled by what people
have to do or say in public.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who calls himself Slatkin's biggest fan, was perhaps
engaging in wishful thinking when he said, ``Leonard and I both
consider this our last job.'' Slatkin seems disinclined to look so
far ahead. But it appears unlikely that he will leave before he
has, at least in his own mind, made the National Symphony the equal
of the St. Louis Symphony and a rival of any orchestra anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   That, after all, is what an orchestra builder does.

PALMER'S ADVICE TO WOODS: ENJOY THE GAME, AND LAUGH
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ Arnold Palmer and Tiger Woods are at different
stages in life, but they shared the spotlight Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer, 69, had a news conference at his Florida residence, Bay
Hill Club and Lodge, to promote his autobiography, ``A Golfer's
Life,'' written with James Dodson. About 30 minutes after Palmer
finished, Woods stepped to the podium and received an award for
being the No. 1 player in the world ranking during 1998.
</P>
<P>
   It was an interesting contrast. At 23, Woods is still in the
early chapters of his career, facing challenges that Palmer has
overcome. Like Palmer, Woods has drawn new fans to golf, elevating
the game's popularity with his talent and charisma. But while
Palmer's impressive accomplishments are in the record books, Woods
will spend the next 15 to 20 years trying to set records.
</P>
<P>
   The most immediate challenge facing Woods is the Bay Hill
Invitational, which begins Thursday. Bay Hill is one of the PGA
Tour's most popular events because it is hosted by Palmer and
because it falls a week before The Players Championship and three
weeks before the Masters. Eight of the top 10 players in the world
will compete _ Woods, Mark O'Meara, the defending champion Ernie
Els, Davis Love III, Lee Westwood, Vijay Singh, Colin Montgomerie
and Justin Leonard.
</P>
<P>
   That field alone will make the event intriguing. And for Woods,
it will be his first tournament since he fired his former caddie,
Mike (Fluff) Cowan, and replaced him with Steve Williams, the
former caddie for both Greg Norman and Raymond Floyd. Woods said he
was already impressed with Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be fine,'' said Woods, who has not gone into
detail about why he fired Cowan. ``His credentials speak for
themselves, caddying for Norman all those years around the world
and caddying for Raymond Floyd the past 12 years. He has won
numerous tournaments. He has a lot of guts, and it's going to be a
lot of fun for both of us. He's very professional. He's a great
caddie.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods' last tournament was two weeks ago, when he was eliminated
in the third round of the Andersen Consulting Match Play
Championship by the winner, Jeff Maggert. On the final hole, Woods
violently slammed his club to the ground after hitting a poor tee
shot, and Palmer, who has given advice to Woods, was not pleased
with that outburst.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take some pride in Tiger and his ability,'' said Palmer, who
is also playing Thursday in a threesome that includes another
legend, Seve Ballesteros. ``That frown, and slamming the club down,
doesn't do anything for him or for his game. He's got the world in
his hands. All he has to do is enjoy it, laugh, and enjoy the
ability that he has to the fullest.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not convincing anyone of anything when he slams the club
down, or gets mad out there. They know he's good. He has proven
that. Now he has to sustain it. Sustain it with enjoyment. I talked
to him about that before he turned pro.''
</P>
<P>
   Told of Palmer's comments, Woods mildly protested. ``It has
decreased quite a bit, but it's part of me,'' said Woods of his
temper. ``I'm just curious why the press doesn't get on Craig
Stadler for doing that. People think it's funny when Stadler does
it, but hate when I do it. I'm not saying it's right, but we're out
there fighting. We're trying to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods did return to the winner's circle last month, capturing
the Buick Invitational, his first victory on tour since April 1998.
However, Woods has been the game's most consistent top-10 finisher
since the start of 1998, and he already has five top-10 finishes in
six starts this year.
</P>
<P>
   While some believe David Duval should be ranked No. 1 instead of
No. 2 behind Woods, others are not so sure. ``Tiger is probably the
most talented player on the PGA Tour,'' said O'Meara, Woods'
closest friend in the game. ``Not to take anything away from David
Duval, because David is a super golfer, a great player. But Tiger
Woods has got it all. This kid has got an incredible 12 to 15 years
ahead of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods hopes O'Meara is right. While Woods has been consistent,
he has not won a major since his Masters' victory in 1997. Woods
believes he has become a much more complete player, improving both
his short game and his distance control. And this year, he hopes
that improvement translates into at least one more major
championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``My swing is improving, my game is improving,'' Woods said.
``The things I'm working on are starting to come to fruition. I'm
excited.''

DOGGED BY WAR TALES, JOHNSON IS LET GO BY JAYS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Tim Johnson proclaimed his Vietnam problem was
behind him. He obviously did not know what lay ahead.
</P>
<P>
   The Toronto Blue Jays fired Johnson as their manager Wednesday,
saying his fantasy life as a Vietnam veteran had become an
unsettling distraction in the team's spring camp. Jim Fregosi, who
has previously managed three other teams, was named to replace
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's tenure as the Blue Jays' manager seemed doomed from
the time last fall when he admitted to manufacturing an account of
combat duty as a Marine during the Vietnam War as well as having
concocted a tale about being offered a basketball scholarship at
UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   Under threat of losing his job, the 49-year-old Johnson met
early in spring training with players who were with the team last
season and apologized to them. He said he felt the meeting enabled
him to put the matter behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to talk to them about a problem I had, guilt I had
for so many years, 30 years,'' Johnson said two weeks ago in Tampa,
Fla., meaning guilt he felt for never having served in Vietnam
while he was in the Marines. ``We talked about it and the response
was unbelievable. I got all choked up because of the support I got
from these players.''
</P>
<P>
   Gord Ash, the Toronto general manager, said Johnson did what he
had to do to try to make his presence as manager work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he tried to get things settled,'' Ash said by
telephone from Dunedin, Fla., ``but there continued to be an
unsettled feeling in camp, a distracted feeling that interfered
with players getting the job done on the field. My intuition told
me if not now, it would happen 30 or 45 days from now. I couldn't
risk the season.''
</P>
<P>
   A managerial firing in spring training is not unprecedented, but
it is rare. Johnson, who managed in the major leagues for the first
time last season, was the first manager fired in spring training
since the San Diego Padres jettisoned Alvin Dark 17 days before the
start of the 1978 season. Some of Dark's players complained about
him, and Ray Kroc, the owner, said Dark overmanaged and tried to do
everything himself.
</P>
<P>
   In 1954, the Chicago Cubs fired Phil Cavaretta after he told the
owner, P.K. Wrigley, the team was headed for another
second-division finish. Wrigley said he didn't like Cavaretta's
``defeatist'' attitude.
</P>
<P>
   The beginning of Johnson's end came Friday when Ash spoke with
the club's ownership and recommended a change. Told to make it, Ash
received permission to talk to Fregosi from the San Francisco
Giants, for whom he was a special assistant to the general manager.
</P>
<P>
   Ash met with Fregosi on Sunday, informed Johnson after a Monday
night exhibition game with the Yankees and met with the players at
9 a.m. Wednesday. ``My feeling is there's a sense of relief that
that chapter is behind us,'' Ash said of the players' perceived
reaction.
</P>
<P>
   Fregosi compiled an 861-937 record as manager of the Angels
(1978-81), the White Sox (1986-88) and the Phillies (1991-96).
Under his direction, the Phillies lost the 1993 World Series to the
Blue Jays. Fregosi, 56, was one of the also-rans when Johnson was
hired to replace Cito Gaston before last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our mandate was not to go with recycled managers then,'' Ash
said. ``We wanted a fresh face and fresh approach. But a year later
I feel our club is different. We have a more reasonable chance of
winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season, the Blue Jays had an 88-74 record and finished
third after briefly making a late-season run at the wild-card spot
for the playoffs.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Speaking in Tampa two weeks ago, Johnson was upbeat and ready to
compete for the wild-card spot again. He said he did not foresee a
credibility problem with the players.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was never an issue with them,'' he said, then recounted
the meeting he had with them. ``They came forward and talked. That
was really impressive. They all had a lot to say. It was all
positive and great.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ash said: ``Each day brought a new revelation from a new
source. The media would go to players and say what do you think
about what this guy said.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't offer specifics, but Ed Sprague, the Blue Jays' third
baseman for more than half of last season, was recently quoted as
calling Johnson a ``liar'' and a ``back stabber.''
</P>
<P>
   Darrin Fletcher, the Blue Jays' catcher, said the change was
probably the right move. ``I was willing to give him a second
chance,'' he said, ``but with all that stuff hanging over his head,
would he have survived the scrutiny the first time we lost two in a
row? I don't think so.''  &QL;

GROUP SUES TO HALT ADS FOR NATION'S LARGEST HMO
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., N.J.)   (rk)

<P>
   In the latest legal attack on managed health care, a consumer
advocacy group asked a California court this week to halt
advertising by Kaiser Permanente, the nation's largest health
maintenance organization, contending that the company's advertising
recruited members by fraudulently portraying Kaiser's 10,000
doctors as not subject to financial constraints on patient care.
</P>
<P>
   The civil suit, filed on Monday in San Francisco, seeks an
injunction on the ads and unspecified monetary damages for hundreds
of thousands of new Kaiser members under California's consumer
protection laws.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Francis J. Crosson, executive director of the Permanente
Federation of Kaiser physician groups, said the lawsuit was
politically motivated _ ``a cheap attempt to embarrass Kaiser in a
setting of legislative issues being decided in California and other
parts of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Managed-care companies are vigorously opposing so-called
patients' rights proposals in Congress and several states that
would make HMOs and other health plans liable in medical
malpractice lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   In another recent case involving managed care, a California
court awarded $116 million in punitive damages to a woman who
contended that Aetna Inc. had improperly delayed care for her
husband, who died of stomach cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Psychologists in New Jersey and California have sued
managed-care companies, contending they fraudulently advertised
mental health coverage. And state boards of medicine in several
states have contested denials of care by doctors who make decisions
on treatment for HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs in the latest case are four individuals and the
Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. &QL;

 SZCZERBIAK LIVING OUT HIS DREAM AS A COLLEGE TOWN RIDES HIS
COATTAILS  (nk) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   OXFORD, Ohio _ Wally Szczerbiak carefully slid out of the
Chevrolet Lumina on High Street, a bounce pass off Miami
University's campus, and the traffic soon stopped. The cars and the
pedestrians. Horns honked and people pointed. Some of the
admittedly apathetic students, who might have yawned if Bill
Clinton had cruised by in a convertible, acted like 3-year-olds who
had just seen Barney.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it him?'' one woman asked, half giggling and half
breathless. ``Is that him?''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it was. It was Szczerbiak, who has long been known as Wally
World here and who has seen his nickname spread throughout the,
well, world, because of his superior play in the National
Collegiate Athletic Association tournament.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to know the main reason that Miami, little Miami of
Ohio, is still alive and playing the defending national champion
Kentucky in the Round of 16 on Friday night in St. Louis, he was
sauntering along High Street on Tuesday night, casually
acknowledging the adulation.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that was because Szczerbiak was too engrossed in the new
T-shirt in the dark window of Follett's Miami Coop Bookstore.
</P>
<P>
   The white shirt had brilliant red letters that said ``Wally's
World'' next to a basketball that resembled a globe. Szczerbiak
studied the shirt as if it were an engagement ring, vowing to buy a
bunch at $16.99 a pop. ``I'm so happy and excited about what has
happened,'' Szczerbiak said. ``This last week has been so
tremendous. I never expected to have a week like this. When you're
in this, you just want to see it continue.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a little-boy quality to Szczerbiak as he discussed
these hoop dreams, which are unfolding before the nation after four
years of his blossoming into a legend. This has been a hectic and
rewarding time for Szczerbiak, the dynamic shooter who has scored
67 of Miami's 125 points in the first two Midwest Regional games
and who revealed that he has the Redhawks winning the NCAA title in
his private pool.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team is a Cinderella story,'' Szczerbiak said. ``Why
not?''
</P>
<P>
   Szczerbiak has been called the best shooter in America. He might
also be the best feel-good story on the best feel-good school in
the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Szczerbiak is handsome enough to be the next tenant on ``Melrose
Place.'' His girlfriend, Shannon Ward, is a part-time model who
could join him there.
</P>
<P>
   Part of Szczerbiak wants to play in the National Basketball
Association, because his father, Walt, a tremendous player in
Europe, was deprived of that chance. Besides that, Szczerbiak is a
gracious 22-year-old from Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., who, so far,
has not let the endless attention inflate his cranium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone said I was going to be the next Larry Bird,''
Szczerbiak said. ``So I said, `Wow.' I never thought that there
would be another Larry Bird. I still don't think there will be.
This attention is great, but the people close to me to know I'm
never going to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Before dinner, the 6-foot-8-inch, 242-pound senior had
sheepishly warned a visitor that he might receive some attention.
Some? Three women in a silver car stopped and gawked at Szczerbiak
before hollering, ``Waaalllleeeee,'' causing Ward to grimace.
</P>
<P>
   Through the mayhem, Szczerbiak kept grinning and nodding and
making everyone feel comfortable. When Szczerbiak ordered the new
Szczerbiak bagel (turkey with cheese on a salt bagel) at Deli and
Bagel, he giddily pointed to his picture on the wall and was as
excited as the woman making the sandwich.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's so secure in himself that he never needed to fill any
void,'' said Ward, who started dating Szczerbiak after they met
four years ago at freshmen orientation. ``It's not like he says,
`I'm the man.' He always thought he was the man. But, as important
as it is to be a good basketball player, he wants to be a good
person, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Walt Szczerbiak, a cautious father who knows better than anyone
that dreams, even careers, can disappear in one moment, said:
``Wally is incredible in that he's enjoying the ride. He has that
confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Before there was a Wally World, there was a little Wally who
followed around his sweet-shooting father. Walt played for the
Pittsburgh Condors of the American Basketball Association for the
1971-72 season and, after the team folded, he was offered a
one-year contract by the Buffalo Braves in the NBA. But Real
Madrid, the premier team in Europe, guaranteed him a five-year deal
so Szczerbiak bolted to Spain. He helped Madrid win three
championships and his 65 points in one game remains a league
record. Still, even though Walt played against NBA-caliber players,
he never played in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a little piece of me that wonders what I could have
done,'' Walt Szczerbiak said.
</P>
<P>
   Wally, who averaged 23.6 points during the regular season, does
not feel pressure to do what his father did not. In fact, the
lessons that Walt gave Wally were always reassuring. When they
played one-on-one in the driveway, Walt always gave himself a
handicap _ such as not being able to block Wally's shots _ even
when Wally was averaging 36.6 points a game as a senior at Cold
Spring Harbor High School on Long Island. So, with each skirmish,
Wally gained more confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father should write a book on how to raise an athlete,''
Szczerbiak said. ``Every time we played, it would be 14-14 and I
would win, 15-14. He kept me excited to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Walt said: ``I didn't want to knock him on his pants like the
Great Santini. I stressed positive reinforcement.''
</P>
<P>
   Szczerbiak was well known in the Mid-American Conference before
this season, but said a defining moment of his career came during
the Goodwill Games. The United States snatched the gold medal last
summer and Szczerbiak led the team with 17.6 points a game, but it
was a scrimmage that convinced him of his worth. He dropped 47
points against his future teammates, dropping at least 47 dozen
jaws, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when I knew,'' Wally said, ``that I could do
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, he can. Szczerbiak excels at the fundamental aspects
of the game that older fans adore and is adept at the flashy
aspects of the game that playground kids adore. Szczerbiak knows
when and how to set a screen as if it were 1960 and when and how to
explode to the hoop as if it were 2000. He always looks in sync,
but it has taken thousands of hours of devotion. Even after dinner
Tuesday, Szczerbiak prolonged a 14-hour day by lifting weights.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the beauty of Wally: he kept working and working,''
Miami Coach Charlie Coles said. ``He didn't start as a sophomore.
He waited his turn and worked hard. He made himself a great
player.''
</P>
<P>
   About an hour before Szczerbiak traipsed along High Street, a
visitor arbitrarily walked into two stores on the block and heard
employees in each discussing the star player. When these eerie
scenes were mentioned to Szczerbiak, he simply shrugged. He is
accustomed to it. But Szczerbiak did not shrug when asked if he was
absorbing every detail of this amazing college experience that will
never occur again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I should sit back and appreciate this a little more,''
he said. ``There's just something about college basketball. You
only go through this once. Everyone is so anxious to get to the NBA
for money, but there's nothing like this. What better thing could I
be doing right now?''  &QL;

KENTUCKY JUDGE ORDERS TEXAS TO TURN OVER 5 SIBLINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE LEE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Kentucky judge has ordered Texas child welfare workers to turn
over five children, despite allegations that their parents abused
them and neglected their education.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state of Texas is ordered to return the children to their
home state of Kentucky ... pending the reunion with their
biological parents, Doug and Kathie Harless,'' District Judge
Kimberly Shumate wrote in a ruling released Wednesday in Hardin
County, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   Texas authorities have said they have jurisdiction over the
children, that they will not release them to Kentucky and that they
intend to put them up for adoption.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers on both sides said the custody issue may be decided in
federal court.
</P>
<P>
   The Hardin County Attorney's Office has sided with Texas
officials and has argued against returning the children, who range
in age from 5 to 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is obvious the Harlesses have a prolonged history of child
abuse and neglect investigation spanning several states,''
Assistant County Attorney Jennifer Pitts wrote in a court filing.
``It is the sincere belief of the commonwealth that the Harlesses
have filed this motion in Kentucky as one more attempt to prevent
the system from catching up with them. Thankfully, Texas has
managed to conduct a thorough investigation, which has uncovered
not only the deplorable conditions under which the Harless children
were living, but also the history of the Harless family in other
states.''
</P>
<P>
   The Harlesses contend that Texas officials are persecuting them
because of their unconventional lifestyle and because they
home-school their children. They have enlisted the help of the
Rutherford Institute, a nonprofit legal group that specializes in
religious and human rights cases and worked on Paula Jones' lawsuit
against President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Haden, a Rutherford Institute litigation counselor,
promised ``vigorous efforts on their behalf, both in Kentucky and
Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Texas improperly removed the children from their parents
because the children had lived in a trailer or were behind on their
education.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that were the case, half the families in rural areas of
America would have their children taken away,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Smith, an associate judge in North Texas' Tarrant County
juvenile court who has been handling the case, said she had not
seen the Kentucky ruling and declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   The Harlesses make a living selling T-shirts and other
merchandise at car races. They say they were living in North Texas
temporarily in 1997 to attend the opening of Texas Motor Speedway
in Fort Worth when Child Protective Services workers put their five
children in foster homes.
</P>
<P>
   Workers with the Texas agency began investigating the Harlesses
in April 1997, when their oldest daughter told police that her
father had slapped her and thrown her against a wall.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Harless said the red mark on his daughter's face was caused
by a skin condition, and no criminal charges were filed.
</P>
<P>
   The agency continued to investigate and found that the Harlesses
had been reported on suspicion of child neglect in Alabama and
Tennessee. In 1996, the family was living outside Talladega, Ala.,
in the trailer of an 18-wheeler with no running water. One of the
children, who was 9, could not recite the alphabet, a report
stated. The Tennessee investigation found nothing because the
Harlesses had moved.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 5, 1997, police and Child Protective Services workers
took the children from a motel room in Denton, Texas, where the
family was living.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just pretty much cluttered, trash piled up, dirty
clothes, toys. The older girl was the one basically taking care of
the kids,'' Denton police Detective Bryan Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 13-year-old boy, I asked him that particular night to say
his alphabet, and he couldn't say his alphabet. They said they
home-schooled the children, and we looked in the motel room for any
type of books, and there weren't any books.''
</P>
<P>
   The Harlesses cooperated with Child Protective Services workers
for about two months, attending parenting classes and renting a
house to be near the children. During a Thanksgiving visit, police
said, they took the four youngest children and left the state.
</P>
<P>
   Texas police issued a warrant accusing the Harlesses of
interference with child custody. The family was found in
Carrollton, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Doug Harless) was dead set about how he wanted to go back
and get this straightened out,'' Carrollton County sheriff's Deputy
Mike Townley said. ``Then we were taking them down the hall, and I
had my back turned and he bolted out the back door.''
</P>
<P>
   Doug Harless was picked up by police about a month later in
Pennsylvania and returned to Texas. Doug and Kathie Harless served
three months in jail, then moved to Kentucky to fight for custody
of their children.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Harless said yesterday that none of the abuse allegations
against him had been proved.
</P>
<P>
   Haden, from the Rutherford Institute, said that even if Harless
had slapped his daughter, ``to discipline a child by limited
corporal punishment is a parental right.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the incident in Georgia, Harless said, he was never
there.

HOUSE PANEL PASSES REPUBLICAN BLUEPRINT FOR TAX CUTS AND SPENDING
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House Budget Committee passed a Republican tax
and spending blueprint Wednesday night, sweeping aside objections
from Democrats who said the plan promised too much in tax cuts and
did too little to deal with the looming problems in Social Security
and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   The party-line vote of 22 to 18 came after another day of
partisan clashes over how the nation should take advantage of its
improving fiscal outlook. The Senate Budget Committee also moved
toward approval of the Republican plan, with a vote expected on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The full House and Senate plan to take up the Republican budget
next week. With approval likely in both chambers, Congress appears
headed toward months of battles with the Clinton administration
encompassing both the annual tax and spending bills and efforts to
shore up Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   The budget outline approved by the House Budget Committee
tonight provides for a tax cut of at least $15 billion next year
and nearly $800 billion over the next decade. It would increase
spending for the military and education, but to remain with the
tight spending limits imposed by the bipartisan 1997 balanced
budget deal, it would scale back a broad array of other programs.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would also require that all excess revenue generated by
the Social Security payroll tax _ $1.8 billion over the next decade
_ be set aside by Congress and used only for reducing the federal
debt or to pay for a change to the retirement system, such as the
establishment of individual investment accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Eager to establish their credentials for fiscal responsibility,
Democrats have also pledged to stick to the spending limits,
constraining their ability to attack Republicans for slashing
domestic programs.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Democrats have been hammering at the Republican plan as
failing to set aside for Medicare any specific amount of money out
of the projected non-Social Security surplus of almost $800 billion
over the next 10 years. The budget proposed last month by President
Clinton set aside $350 billion over that period to help keep
Medicare, the health insurance system for the elderly, from going
broke as the population ages.
</P>
<P>
   The administration also opened an attack Wednesday on the
Republican proposal to lock away the Social Security surpluses by
writing into law a gradual reduction in the amount of public debt
the government could have outstanding.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Democratic leaders in Congress, Treasury
Secretary Robert E. Rubin said the Republican ``lockbox'' plan
could leave the treasury unable to refinance debt or issue new debt
in an unexpected economic downturn. As a result, Rubin said, he
would recommend that Clinton veto the bill.
</P>
<P>
   In both the House and Senate committees, Democrats offered
proposals that would have blocked or reduced the Republican tax
cuts, but were thwarted on party-line votes.
</P>
<P>
   The budget resolutions making their way through the two chambers
will not become law and are not subject to a veto. But they set the
priorities for the tax-writing and appropriations committees as
they develop legislation over the rest of the year, and they amount
to a detailed agenda for the Republican-controlled Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest hurdle facing the Republican plan may come not from
the White House, but from the difficulty Congress will have in
voting to cut dozens of popular programs at a time when the economy
is strong and projections of future surpluses continue to grow.
</P>
<P>
   Even Republicans on the appropriations committees are skeptical
that they can pass bills enacting deep spending cuts. Both parties
are hopeful that projections of next year's surplus will be
increased in coming months.
</P>
<P>
   And in both parties there is a growing sense that the most
likely way out of the problem is a deal late in the year that would
split any fiscal windfall between spending and bigger tax cuts.

<P>
   HACKENSACK, N.J. _ Twenty-five black and Hispanic criminal
defendants are in legal limbo after the New Jersey Attorney
General's office postponed their prosecutions because all were
arrested or stopped by two troopers involved in a controversial
shooting on the New Jersey Turnpike last April.
</P>
<P>
   Their defense lawyers have said that the unusual legal step has
denied their clients' rights to speedy trials and stalled court
challenges to the arrests. In addition, the suspended cases have
prevented two defense lawyers from getting documents they want to
examine for evidence that the state police singled out black and
Hispanic motorists in their search for drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the lawyers are eager to get to court to press
contentions that their clients were the victims of such racial
profiling. If a judge agrees, the lawyers said, both the stops and
charges stemming from them would be illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Despite grumbling about the right to a speedy trial, other
defense lawyers said they are content to wait because they think
the troopers will be indicted by a state grand jury investigating
the April shooting. If indicted, the lawyers said, the troopers
would be useless as prosecution witnesses and the charges against
their clients would probably be thrown out.
</P>
<P>
   Under court rules, state prosecutors must give defense lawyers
state police reports on the arrests, statements by witnesses and
any material that could establish the innocence of the suspects,
who have been indicted on drugs or weapons charges.
</P>
<P>
   But last December, a state judge granted a motion by a senior
deputy attorney general, John M. Fahy, to withhold such documents
in these cases.
</P>
<P>
   The troopers, John Hogan and James Kenna, have been under
investigation by a state grand jury since May for shooting three
unarmed minority men after their van was stopped on the turnpike.
Hogan has been on medical leave since the day after the shooting,
although the State Police would not say why. Kenna has been on desk
duty since then.
</P>
<P>
   Fahy said in court papers that Hogan and Kenna were important
witnesses in all the cases because they either stopped, questioned
or arrested the suspects in 1997 or early 1998. Fahy argued that
the state's Division of Criminal Justice could not decide which
documents to give defense lawyers until the state grand jury
finished investigating the van shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that the matter involving Troopers Hogan and Kenna is
an ongoing investigation strongly favors maintaining the secrecy of
information developed to protect the integrity of the
investigation,'' Fahy said in his motion.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 11, a state Superior Court Judge Barnett E. Hoffman
granted Fahy's request to place the cases on an inactive list for
120 days, until early April.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman's ruling prevented defense lawyers from appearing in
court to argue that their clients were the victims of illegal stops
and searches. It spared Hogan and Kenna from attending court
hearings and facing defense lawyers' questions about racial
profiling.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the 25 cases involving black or Hispanic
defendants, one other case was also put on hold by the attorney
general's office. The ethnic backgrounds of this defendant could
not be determined from his arrest file.
</P>
<P>
   One of the 26 with a suspended case, Michael G. Moye, a
television producer, said the ruling has delayed his right to
challenge Hogan on the details of his arrest on weapons charges on
March 31, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Moye, co-creator of the situation comedy ``Married ... with
Children,'' contended that Hogan stopped him _ erroneously _ for
speeding and then told him he smelled marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the biggest pile of hooey,'' Moye said. ``I don't
even smoke cigarettes. This was an absolutely illegal stop. I'm a
black guy and I had braids. I'm sure I scored a 10 out of 10.''
</P>
<P>
   Moye said he was taking two handguns and a shotgun, all legally
purchased and registered, from his home in California to his home
in Greenwich, Conn., when he was arrested. The weapons are part of
a collection he and his wife take to shooting ranges on the West
Coast, Moye said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him I had the guns,'' Moye said. He was arrested and
the guns were confiscated because two of them were loaded.
</P>
<P>
   Moye called the delay unfair. ``I have no record,'' he said.
``I'm an honest citizen. I can't purchase a weapon until they
finish this. My bail money is tied up. I'm being punished.''
</P>
<P>
   Moye's lawyer, Linda Smink, said the delay prevents her from
questioning Hogan in court about profiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt in the world that troopers are doing profile
stops,'' Ms. Smink said. ``Anyone who says they're not is asleep.''
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Davis, a spokesman for the attorney general's office, said
Fahy declined to comment on the case, except to say that Hoffman's
ruling was upheld by a state appeals court.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman said his December order would not have any bearing on
defense motions for speedy trials. But so far, few have been filed.
</P>
<P>
   Early last month, a state judge rejected a motion filed for a
black man from North Carolina who was arrested on drug charges
after Hogan stopped him last March 17.
</P>
<P>
   Allan Marain, who represents the suspect, Elijah M. Roberts,
said a state judge ruled that Roberts had no standing to seek a
speedy trial because Hoffman had rendered his case inactive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a ruling from the twilight zone,'' Marain said.

GALAXY HOPES NEW STARS HALT PLAYOFF SPIRAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ The pressure will be on again in October _
this time more than before.
</P>
<P>
   For the next eight months, Galaxy coach Octavio Zambrano will
prepare his team for the only games that matter _ the Major League
Soccer playoffs. That's when jobs will be on the line, particularly
his.
</P>
<P>
   The season begins Saturday with a game against Colorado at the
Rose Bowl, but the challenge will last long after that.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy has proved to be Major League Soccer's most dominant
franchise during the regular season. It set nearly every team
record imaginable a year ago _ most goals, least goals allowed,
most victories, most points and longest winning streak. In three
years, the Galaxy has captured two Western Conference
regular-season titles and reached the championship game once, in
1996. But that's where the hoopla ends.
</P>
<P>
   There was no championship in 1996, just a 3-2 overtime loss to
D.C. United after the Galaxy blew a 2-0 lead midway through the
second half. In 1997, the Galaxy was swept by Dallas in the first
round of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   A huge favorite to reach the final in 1998, the Galaxy was swept
by eventual champ Chicago in the Western Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year we want to win the championship ... we expect to
win the championship,'' Zambrano said. ``Every year we have come up
short. We will forever be expected to win. If you don't, you have
to pay the consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   To add to the pressure, this may be the Galaxy's least
attractive team yet, at least while it embraces a youth movement.
</P>
<P>
   If disgruntled playmaker Mauricio Cienfuegos misses any matches
because of his contract dispute with the league, a mixed group of
young and veteran Americans will hold the team's future in their
hands.
</P>
<P>
   Cienfuegos, 31, a holdout since training began in February,
reported to training camp Monday. However, he will leave town today
if a new contract isn't worked out, said his agent, Corey
Clemetson.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy is already without three other foreigners who were on
the club last season. Guatemala's Martin Machon, apparently at odds
with Zambrano, was loaned to Santos in Mexico in the last year of
his MLS contract, essentially ending his MLS career. Ecuador's
Wellington Sanchez was sold to an Ecuadoran club and Mexican
striker Carlos Hermosillo is expected to miss two months while he
finishes his season in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The expectations were raised under the new ownership of Philip
F. Anschutz, who purchased the club for $26 million in October. The
Galaxy will have to move forward with an inexperienced midfield of
Clint Mathis, Joey Franchino, Daniel Hernandez and veteran Danny
Pena.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a competitive disadvantage (not having foreigners),
without a doubt,'' Zambrano said. ``We've already begun playing
with Clint and Daniel. It's not going to be the same Galaxy team,
but it doesn't mean it's going to be a less attractive team.''
</P>
<P>
   Mathis, expected to play a big role this season, has seen
valuable time on the U.S. National team under new coach Bruce
Arena. He said he and the others are ready to show that the Galaxy
can win with a predominantly American lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can play; a lot of people overlook the American players,''
Mathis said. ``This is a huge opportunity to see what kind of
talent we have, especially against other teams with plenty of
foreigners.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the only question anyone cares about is, can this
team win a championship?
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were to say, can I win with a team that is all
Americans, I tell you a resounding yes,'' Zambrano said. ``Can we
win a championship? That's another question. That's another
situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a saying in soccer that young players win games, but
experienced players win championships. I think with very few
exceptions in the history of soccer that has been true. Sometimes a
young team can win because of exuberance and dynamics, but at the
end of the day you need that experience that a bona fide foreign
player can give you to make that difference.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ecuadoran coach, in his second full season after guiding
L.A. to an MLS-best 24-8 record in 1998, says he isn't conceding
the season by any means. The Galaxy may lack foreign experience
until MLS allocates foreign-born players, but it has a wealth of
American experience.
</P>
<P>
   The defense is led by former U.S. National team defender Paul
Caligiuri and U.S. defender Robin Fraser, coupled with outside
defensive attackers Greg Vanney and Ezra Hendrickson.
</P>
<P>
   Though the midfield is young, U.S. Player of the Year Cobi Jones
is on the front line along with Welton, coming off his finest
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not just a bunch of young kids. We have a proper
balance, which is why I won't say this team can't win a
championship,'' Zambrano said. ``This season will serve as a
gaining of experience for a lot of our young guys who haven't had a
full season. Mathis, Franchino, Hernandez, Jolley, none of these
guys have had a full professional season under their belt.''

STATE INVESTIGATING COMPLAINTS OF BIAS AGAINST NEW YORK CITY
POLICE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Attorney General Eliot L. Spitzer said Wednesday that
his office would investigate allegations that New York City police
officers stop people on the streets and frisk them without
justification.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer, who took office in January, said that he decided to
begin the state inquiry after hearing many complaints during
campaign stops last year at churches, business forums and colleges
that blacks and other minority residents were often subjected to
improper searches and frisks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a tidal wave of concern about this issue,'' he said.
``It is impossible to be out there and not get a sense that this is
perceived as the overwhelming civil rights issue facing the city.''
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer said that his investigators would use their subpoena
powers to collect data, interview officials and talk to people who
complain that they were unfairly stopped and frisked by the police
to try to determine if there is a systematic problem. Several
lawyers will be assigned to the inquiry full-time, and more will be
added when they are needed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   And depending on what the investigation yields, Spitzer said,
its outcome could range from a written report of its findings and
recommendations to a civil-rights lawsuit to try to force the
Police Department to change its practices.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has been brought to the fore since the Feb. 4 shooting
of Amadou Diallo by four police officers, which focused attention
on the city's street crimes unit, which has been crediting with
taking more illegal handguns off the streets then any other.
</P>
<P>
   But critics have warned that its success has come at a price. Of
the 27,061 people frisked by the unit last year, only 4,647 were
arrested _ meaning more than 22,000 people were frisked because
they were mistakenly thought to be armed. The year before was only
marginally better: of 18,023 people frisked in 1997, only 4,899
were arrested.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the Police Department, Marilyn Mode, said:
``We will cooperate fully with the attorney general.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael D. Hess, the city's corporation counsel, said that the
Giuliani administration had been apprised of the pending
investigation and added that he was confident that it would find
that the police follow proper procedures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always try to cooperate and respond to a legitimate
inquiry,'' he said. ``I think there are probably thousands of such
stops and frisks a year, and I'm confident that overall, this is
done is a proper and constitutional way.''

THEATER REVIEW: SUCH RIB-STICKING MEAT PIES! 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.) (Eds.: Production notes at end of review.) 
(nk) 
 By PETER MARKS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If she doesn't erase memories of Angela Lansbury,
radiating dotty, malicious charm in the original Broadway
production of ``Sweeney Todd, the Demon Barber of Fleet Street,''
Christine Baranski certainly supplies wondrous new ones.
</P>
<P>
   Her fey, wisecracking turn as Mrs. Lovett, the all-too-practical
meat pie maven of Stephen Sondheim's mercilessly brilliant 1979
musical, provided the highest highs in this 20th-anniversary
concert version of the landmark show, staged over the weekend here
by Reprise, the West Coast answer to City Center's hugely
successful Encores musicals-in-concert series.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Baranski's contributions to the lavish, five-performance
revival at the Ahmanson Theater, which also featured Kelsey
Grammer, Melissa Manchester, Neil Patrick Harris and Davis Gaines,
should without a doubt place her on the short list of potential
Mrs. Lovetts, if and when ``Sweeney Todd'' comes back to Broadway.
And while we're at it let's declare it no contest for the roles of
Anthony, the story's lovesick sailor, and Toby, the wayward
manchild, in any future production: the vocally astonishing Gaines,
a longtime Broadway Phantom, and the exceptionally tender Harris,
best known and criminally underemployed as television's Doogie
Howser, were nothing less than breathtaking in their respective
parts.
</P>
<P>
   A fringe benefit of short-run concert stagings of old musicals
is the luring of dream casts of a caliber that once upon a time
would have been happily ensconced in long runs in New York. Drawing
on the large pool of stage-trained actors working in Hollywood _
Grammer and Ms. Baranski as well as supporting players in the show
like Gaines, Scott Waara and Ken Howard have all performed on
Broadway _ Reprise has acquired the knack after Encores of stocking
its pond with big, talented fish. (Encores, which spawned the hit
Broadway revival of ``Chicago,'' pioneered the musicals-in-concert
formula that is now being applied not only in Los Angeles but also
in a yearly series at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing
Arts in Washington.)
</P>
<P>
   Another benefit of this format is the potential for a new
perspective on a show that in its previous incarnations may have
been mishandled or misunderstood, and this is the arena in which
the Reprise ``Sweeney Todd'' falls short. Perhaps it is too much to
ask of Reprise to accomplish more than musical appreciation;
``Sweeney Todd,'' with its baroquely agonized melodies and
grotesque tale of the collaboration between a killer barber and the
adoring woman who bakes his victims into pies, is one of the most
imaginative musical concoctions of all time. But in Calvin
Remsberg's faithful revival there was more curating than creating.
While musically enjoyable it lacked the visceral power to fully
engage the material, and as a result the skin never crawled.
</P>
<P>
   A member of the show's original national tour, in which he
portrayed the corrupt Beadle, Remsberg relied so heavily on what
has been done before that his ``Sweeney Todd'' at many times came
across as a watered-down variation on ``Sweeneys'' past. (The demon
barber, played with a curious bloodlessness by Grammer of
``Frasier'' fame, even parted his hair down the middle, like every
other Sweeney.)
</P>
<P>
   Only in the sequence involving the shaving contest between Todd
and Waara's assured, debonair Pirelli did Remsberg reveal a real
directorial flair. The scene, an extended operatic parody, can
often seem labored and awkward, an interlude to be endured. But
Remsberg, taking advantage of Waara's skill at physical comedy,
transformed it into a breezy spoof.
</P>
<P>
   The real innovations here, however, came in the guise of
individual performance. Grammer, unfortunately, seemed a bit
intimidated by the role of Sweeney; vocally he does not have the
upper register for the demanding part, and the deficiency seemed to
drain the portrayal of energy. Similarly Dale Kristien's virginal
Johanna, the long-lost daughter of Todd, and Ken Howard's
villainous Judge Turpin suffered from underdevelopment. Ms.
Manchester's Beggar Woman, while beautifully sung, had no tragic
dimension. It was left to Ms. Baranski, Harris and Gaines to ring
this musical's haunting bells, and each came through vibrantly at a
critical juncture in the show's musical progression.
</P>
<P>
   Gaines' triumph occurred first, in ``Johanna,'' the song that
jet-propels the love story; it's hard to conceive a closer
approximation of shouting from the rooftops. Harris' moment came
last, during his purring second-act rendition of ``Not While I'm
Around.'' It was the capstone to a portrayal of surprising clarity
and sensitivity that made sense of the character for what seemed
like the first time ever. Harris' Toby became the conscience of the
piece. Through him you believed in the possibility of redemption.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Baranski, meanwhile, scored at will all evening. The
performance reaffirmed Mrs. Lovett as the show's juiciest role. As
the cunning mechanic who keeps the killing machine humming, the
actress must be warm and creepy at the same time. Ms. Baranski had
no trouble conveying those contradictory qualities, which were
brought to life most amazingly in her superb rendition of ``By the
Sea,'' a music hall ditty that in other productions has functioned
as a throwaway number. In Ms. Baranski's delightful delivery it
became Mrs. Lovett's marvelously twisted manifesto, the wish list
of a malevolent nature with mundane desires expressing the kind of
demented neediness an audience would die for.

TRAVELING WILL COST RODMAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Worm Watch reached Day 5, and the tale grew stranger
still.
</P>
<P>
   A source told the Daily News that Dennis Rodman is no longer in
Las Vegas or Newport Beach, but Cancun, Mexico (a destination, of
course, once touted by ex-Laker Nick Van Exel, in a moment of
personal infamy).
</P>
<P>
   And the Los Angeles Lakers, who have called Rodman's absence
``excused,'' nevertheless plan to fine him.
</P>
<P>
   But it was management that made that decision, not the players _
as alleged by TNT reporter Craig Sager on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Sager's report that Shaquille O'Neal called a team vote to fine
Rodman was greeted with amusement and puzzlement Wednesday. Sager's
source for the report was supposedly Rodman himself, with whom
Sager is chummy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Craig Sager's a liar,'' O'Neal said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Players haven't even discussed Rodman as an issue, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kurt (Rambis), Jerry West and Mitch Kupchak handle that,''
O'Neal said. ``Any votes that go down are called by the president,
handled by the president and tallied up by the president _ me.
There was no votes, so I don't know what the hell Craig's talking
about....
</P>
<P>
   ``If TNT said that, then I'm taking _ what's his name, the owner
of TNT? _ I'll take Ted Turner to court, and I'll settle out for a
million. I'm gonna sue Ted.''
</P>
<P>
   Rambis was absolutely befuddled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now how would Rodman know about a team vote if (he's) not
here? Why would (Sager) report that we took a team vote? That's
crazy, that's ludicrous, that's a bunch of B.S.,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The story was reminiscent of last year's report by Fox Sports _
also erroneous _ that players had voted unanimously to oust coach
Del Harris.
</P>
<P>
   ``We handle our disciplinary problems internally, through
management,'' Rambis said. ``(Players) don't determine who gets
fined, they don't have a say in it.... They can vote 'til their
heads blow off.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Rodman ``definitely will be fined,'' Rambis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has nothing to do with Vegas.... You're allowed certain
leniencies for some things, but you're still responsible to being
with the team,'' he said. ``I think the difference lies in how long
an excused absence is.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers have not set a deadline for Rodman to return, nor
have they reached the point of considering more drastic measures,
such as releasing him.
</P>
<P>
   Rambis still believes Rodman might return by the time this
six-game road trip ends, Monday in Dallas, but assumes nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until I see his glowing, orange head walk through the door, I
don't know when he's coming back,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sam's town: Homecoming wasn't as enjoyable this time when Lakers
rookie Sam Jacobson returned to his home state of Minnesota on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   His alma mater, the University of Minnesota, is embroiled in an
academic fraud scandal, stemming from an ex-university tutor's
claim she did players' homework for them. Four players were held
out of the Gophers' NCAA Tournament opener, which they lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shocked,'' Jacobson said. ``Coach (Clem) Haskins, he
stresses academics pretty strongly.''
</P>
<P>
   The entire state has been consumed by the scandal, to the point
that Gov. Jesse Ventura has even weighed in with a critique of the
newspaper that broke the story.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like Monica Lewinsky out there,'' Jacobson said.

EAST WALKER IS UNIQUE WINTER ANGLING DIVERSION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRETT PAULY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRIDGEPORT, Calif. _ However contradictory it sounded, the
statement was music to the ears.
</P>
<P>
   ``The disco midge was the rock 'n' rollin' fly,'' said Valencia
fly-fishing instructor Joe Contaldi, my angling partner on this
partly cloudy day along a stretch of the East Walker River in
Nevada's Lyon County. ``We caught more fish on that today.''
</P>
<P>
   The fly pattern tied to imitate a bug in its waterborne larval
stage was minute and minimal, less than three-eighths of an inch in
length. But it had just enough glean, just enough of that '70s
flash for which it was named, to catch the eye of the nearly two
dozen trout released during our eight hours on the river.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a good day. Getting a dozen fish per person is good,''
said Contaldi. He landed 15 rainbows and browns to 17 inches on
this 7-mile publicly owned section of the East Walker in Toiyabe
National Forest known as Rosaschi Ranch. Here catch and release is
the law and only artificial lures or flies with single, barbless
hooks are permitted.
</P>
<P>
   I brought to the shallows seven rainbows from 12 to 16{ inches
and a gorgeous 14-inch brown. And the rainbows weren't the skinny,
bland stockers that are taken by zealous anglers an hour after
being planted; these were fat, big-headed fish with bright, crimson
gill plates that had been in the river for quite some time.
</P>
<P>
   But Contaldi's assessment must have been an overstatement;
surely a dozen releases was at the top of the fishing scale, and I
was feeling quite proud of my accomplishment. But, alas, he had
nailed close to 30 trout during a road trip to the lonely river
just the weekend before.
</P>
<P>
   Still, we were doing better than some of the other eight or so
anglers there.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fishing was great; the catching was slow,'' said
Glendale's John Gramatky, whose wintertime pilgrimages to the East
Walker began in 1963. The suspender midge at his line's end was
``hot mostly everywhere, but it was cold on the East Walker.''
</P>
<P>
   Gramatky hadn't counted on the power of the disco midge. ``I
guess I needed some of that Bee Gees magic,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the disco midge was special.
</P>
<P>
   Like many fly patterns, the history of the disco midge is
uncertain, at least in this area. Some think it originated in
Colorado or New Mexico, perhaps the Northwest. A fairly recent
pattern presumably named after the short-lived music and dance
craze of the 1970s, its thin body is accented with plastic foil in
light olive, pearl, pink or red and its head is peacock herl.
</P>
<P>
   Not uncommon, the disco midge is stocked in most of the better
fly shops. Meant to mimic a midge larvae, it also looks like a tiny
worm and is commonly found tied to the tippet in tandem below a San
Juan worm pattern that serves to attract trout to the midge. (A San
Juan worm can certainly pick up its share of fish, and was the
pattern that fooled my 16{-inch rainbow.)
</P>
<P>
   Use of the disco midge in the Eastern Sierra has become more
common in recent years, according to Steve Kennedy, owner of the
Trout Fitter in Mammoth Lakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guides kept it quiet for a while, but a couple of years ago
the secret got out,'' Kennedy said. ``It's part of the cycle with
flies; you want something the fish don't see every weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   And apparently it's a winner on the East Walker in winter, when
reduced flows fed from the Bridgeport Reservoir are exceptionally
fishable and the resident trout population dine primarily
underwater on midges, stoneflies, mayflies and caddisflies in their
immature stages.
</P>
<P>
   For Eastern Sierra anglers, the Nevada side of the East Walker
is one of the only games in town during winter. Most of the
region's California-side trout streams and lakes are closed to
angling from November through late April. But for those willing to
make the trip, the East Walker can be the offseason answer to a
trout addiction and a tremendous warmup to the Eastern Sierra trout
opener.
</P>
<P>
   The California and Nevada sides of the East Walker are very
different, according to fishery biologists in both states.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the California reach of the East Walker, the (Bridgeport
Reservoir) dam prevents sediment from coming down and it has a
steeper gradient so the river runs faster, meaning spawning gravel
and natural reproduction (of trout) is limited,'' said Steve
Parmenter, an associate fishery biologist with the Department of
Fish and Game in Bishop. Consequently, California has an aggressive
stocking program in which 100,000 put-and-grow fingerling brown
trout are planted in the East Walker every summer.
</P>
<P>
   While most of the California fish are hatchery browns that
struggle to carry over in harsher winters, in Nevada's Rosaschi
Ranch most of the trout _ about two-thirds browns, one-third
rainbows _ are wild. That is, they are spawned and hatched in the
river and then go on to produce progeny of their, said Pat
Sollberger, a fisheries biologist with Nevada Division of Wildlife
in Carson City.
</P>
<P>
   Natural reproduction is favorable because the farther the river
travels from the dam, additional substrate _ and invaluable gravel
for spawning _ flows in from tributary streams, the biologists
said. Furthermore, the gradient of Nevada's East Walker flattens
out and slows down, allowing the gravel to stick around longer and
accumulate deeper.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the population ratio, Contaldi and I landed four
rainbows to every brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you catch and what's actually out there is two different
things,'' Sollberger explained. ``Generally, browns are more wary,
and I don't know why, but that changes at different times of the
year.''
</P>
<P>
   But the brand of trout matters little in Nevada, where a strange
phenomenon from the '70s will lure either species like ``Hot
Stuff'' on Donna Summer.

HOUSE PANEL PASSES REPUBLICAN BLUEPRINT FOR TAX CUTS AND SPENDING
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: SUBS 5th graf, The plan ..., to CORRECT figure to $1.8
TRillion, sted billion, for excess revenue over next decade.)  
 (rk) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House Budget Committee passed a Republican tax
and spending blueprint Wednesday night, sweeping aside objections
from Democrats who said the plan promised too much in tax cuts and
did too little to deal with the looming problems in Social Security
and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   The party-line vote of 22 to 18 came after another day of
partisan clashes over how the nation should take advantage of its
improving fiscal outlook. The Senate Budget Committee also moved
toward approval of the Republican plan, with a vote expected on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The full House and Senate plan to take up the Republican budget
next week. With approval likely in both chambers, Congress appears
headed toward months of battles with the Clinton administration
encompassing both the annual tax and spending bills and efforts to
shore up Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   The budget outline approved by the House Budget Committee
tonight provides for a tax cut of at least $15 billion next year
and nearly $800 billion over the next decade. It would increase
spending for the military and education, but to remain with the
tight spending limits imposed by the bipartisan 1997 balanced
budget deal, it would scale back a broad array of other programs.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would also require that all excess revenue generated by
the Social Security payroll tax _ $1.8 trillion over the next
decade _ be set aside by Congress and used only for reducing the
federal debt or to pay for a change to the retirement system, such
as the establishment of individual investment accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Eager to establish their credentials for fiscal responsibility,
Democrats have also pledged to stick to the spending limits,
constraining their ability to attack Republicans for slashing
domestic programs.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Democrats have been hammering at the Republican plan as
failing to set aside for Medicare any specific amount of money out
of the projected non-Social Security surplus of almost $800 billion
over the next 10 years. The budget proposed last month by President
Clinton set aside $350 billion over that period to help keep
Medicare, the health insurance system for the elderly, from going
broke as the population ages.
</P>
<P>
   The administration also opened an attack Wednesday on the
Republican proposal to lock away the Social Security surpluses by
writing into law a gradual reduction in the amount of public debt
the government could have outstanding.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Democratic leaders in Congress, Treasury
Secretary Robert E. Rubin said the Republican ``lockbox'' plan
could leave the treasury unable to refinance debt or issue new debt
in an unexpected economic downturn. As a result, Rubin said, he
would recommend that Clinton veto the bill.
</P>
<P>
   In both the House and Senate committees, Democrats offered
proposals that would have blocked or reduced the Republican tax
cuts, but were thwarted on party-line votes.
</P>
<P>
   The budget resolutions making their way through the two chambers
will not become law and are not subject to a veto. But they set the
priorities for the tax-writing and appropriations committees as
they develop legislation over the rest of the year, and they amount
to a detailed agenda for the Republican-controlled Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest hurdle facing the Republican plan may come not from
the White House, but from the difficulty Congress will have in
voting to cut dozens of popular programs at a time when the economy
is strong and projections of future surpluses continue to grow.
</P>
<P>
   Even Republicans on the appropriations committees are skeptical
that they can pass bills enacting deep spending cuts. Both parties
are hopeful that projections of next year's surplus will be
increased in coming months.
</P>
<P>
   And in both parties there is a growing sense that the most
likely way out of the problem is a deal late in the year that would
split any fiscal windfall between spending and bigger tax cuts.

EDITORIAL: THE CARNAGE AT BOURBONNAIS  
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   The New York Times said in an
editorial on Thursday, March 18:
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tragedies like Monday night's collision of an Amtrak passenger
train and a truck in Bourbonnais, Ill., south of Chicago, often
appear to be freak accidents that would be difficult to prevent.
But adopting that attitude toward the collision that took at least
11 lives and injured more than 100 people would be shortsighted.
</P>
<P>
   Even if human error _ possible reckless driving around warning
gates by a truck driver with a problematic driving record _ turns
out to be a cause of the collision, there are steps that can be
taken to lessen the risks at the nation's more than 260,000
grade-level rail crossings. Curbing fatalities is going to require
local, state and federal officials to accelerate the use of
engineering solutions, law enforcement and public education.
</P>
<P>
   The number of fatalities caused by train-vehicle collisions has
been dropping in recent years, but deaths at rail crossings still
totaled 422 last year. It would not be hard to reduce the carnage.
</P>
<P>
   Municipal, county and state officials have long had priority
lists for making safety improvements at rail crossings. The problem
is usually money. The best solution, bridges or tunnels that put
vehicles and trains at different levels, is the most costly.
</P>
<P>
   In the short run, localities and states should quickly install
inexpensive deterrents like better lighting, rumble strips and
surveillance cameras, use aggressive policing and impose stiff
fines that will discourage most drivers from going around barriers.
In the long run, both localities and states should accelerate the
installation of better barriers at crossings, particularly the type
that are difficult to drive around.
</P>
<P>
   When safety experts and communities concur on the need for
multimillion-dollar grade separation projects, these capital
projects should be expedited. America, which is developing more
high-speed rail corridors, cannot afford to be blase just because
each accident seems to be freakish and rare.

MARBURY'S 29 INVIGORATES NETS AND FANS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ With 16 friends and family members plus
thousands of eager Nets fans watching, Stephon Marbury proved he
could live up to the hype Wednesday night at Continental Arena. In
his first home game as a Net, the Brooklyn-bred playmaker scored a
game-high 29 points to lead the Nets to an 88-87 victory over the
Dallas Mavericks and end New Jersey's eight-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   While Marbury made numerous clutch baskets, his backcourt mate,
Kerry Kittles, scored the game-winning points by hitting two free
throws with 17 seconds remaining. Kittles, who scored just 8
points, earned the chance for redemption by rebounding a missed
running jumper by Marbury and being fouled.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas, which dropped to 8-16, had a chance to win, but Michael
Finley's 16-footer over Kendall Gill bounced in and out of the rim
as the buzzer sounded. The missed shot sent the Nets, and
particularly Marbury, into a frenzy, as they jumped around the
court with outstretched arms.
</P>
<P>
   Marbury was more emotional than anyone, and it was not the first
time of the night. After tying the score at 85-85 on a 3-point play
with 57 seconds left, the newest Net ran across midcourt, raising
both arms to get the crowd involved on his way to the bench after a
timeout was called.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas regained the lead, 87-85, when Gary Trent backed in
Jayson Williams to score with 38 seconds left. That set up the
Nets' final offensive sequence, highlighted by Marbury and Kittles.
</P>
<P>
   For the Nets (4-18), Williams grabbed 21 rebounds and Keith Van
Horn had 19 points and 10 rebounds. Gill scored 15 points. Trent
and Finley led the Mavericks with 21 points apiece.
</P>
<P>
   In his first major change since replacing John Calipari as
coach, Don Casey essentially used Marbury as a shooting guard and
ran the offense through him. While Kittles and Doug Overton handled
the ball above the 3-point line, Marbury ran off screens to get
open on the wings. Once he received the ball, the offense was in
his hands.
</P>
<P>
   Using his quickness and a number of electrifying moves, he
created shots for himself and his teammates. His breathtaking
crossover and behind-the-back dribbles drew buzzes from the crowd
and enabled him to get to the basket for shots in the lane. When
his own shot wasn't there, he kicked the ball out to open
teammates. But the Nets' inability to make jumpers kept them from
capitalizing.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Nets' dismal shooting _ they were 9 for 33 (27
percent) midway through the second quarter _ enabled Dallas to go
ahead by 35-23 five minutes before the half. But just when it
seemed the Nets would fall to yet another less-talented opponent,
they erupted.
</P>
<P>
   With Horn waking from a first-quarter slumber in which he scored
just 2 points, the Nets finished the half with a 19-4 run. And most
impressively, all of the points came on driving layups, tip-in
dunks or free throws. It was an example of the Nets doing something
they had failed to do all season _ adjusting.
</P>
<P>
   Van Horn scored two baskets on penetration moves and hit three
free throws for 7 points during the run. He gave the Nets their
first lead under Casey when hitting two foul shots with 36 seconds
remaining in the half to give the Nets a 41-39 advantage. After
Marbury scored his 12th point on a free throw just before the
break, the Nets went into the locker room ahead by 3.
</P>
<P>
   While the strategy to play through Marbury was neither brilliant
nor creative, it was at least a plan, and that pleased the former
Brooklyn Lincoln High School star. After his first two games with
the Nets, Marbury complained about the club's lack of a game plan.
He had come from the system-strong Minnesota Timberwolves to a team
that he said was basically playing street ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have a strategy,'' Marbury said before the game in
reference to losses in Miami and Toronto. ``We just came out and
played basketball, and in order to win games in the NBA, you have
to have a strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   Things got rough less than two minutes into the third, when Van
Horn reacted to the slinging elbows of Shawn Bradley, the former
Nets' disappointment. While Bradley was putting up a shot, Van Horn
dumped him with a forearm shiver to the chest that sent Bradley
into a fury. Though the two players began yapping, no fracas ensued
because players and referees intervened.

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, March 18:
</P>
<P>
   The federal government's decision on Tuesday to order new
protections for nine threatened salmon populations in the Pacific
Northwest is just the beginning of what could be the biggest and
most expensive rescue effort in the 26-year history of the
Endangered Species Act. It is an effort worth making.
</P>
<P>
   The decline of the once-great salmon runs of the Pacific
Northwest ranks high among the ecological blunders committed in the
name of economic growth. The time has surely come to correct that
mistake.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the challenge uniquely interesting is its reach.
Salmon spawn throughout the Pacific Northwest, so any effort to
save them will have to be regional in scope. The effort will
inevitably require higher taxes to clean hundreds of waterways and
buy open space in crucial watersheds. It will impose tough
restrictions on new construction, farming and logging, and may even
require the costly decommissioning of federal and private dams that
impede salmon runs but have also long supplied the Pacific
Northwest with cheap power. The early response from local
politicians and citizens has been extraordinarily positive. One
reason is that the salmon is not only economically important to the
Pacific Northwest but is virtually a cultural icon. Beyond that,
many local residents are consumed by fears that development will
someday destroy the natural beauty that surrounds them.
</P>
<P>
   A save-the-salmon effort, with all the restrictions that
implies, is thus seen as a timely antidote to shapeless sprawl. As
Seattle's mayor, Paul Schell, noted, ``as we work to save the
salmon, it may turn out that the salmon save us.''
</P>
<P>
   But this battle has a very long way to go. It is one thing to
preach salvation. It is quite another to pay the price when the
controls kick in _ when farmers have to stop using pesticides, when
developers have to stop building in sensitive watersheds, when
loggers have to stop cutting trees along salmon-bearing streams.
Today's euphoria could easily become tomorrow's backlash.
</P>
<P>
   There are also many questions surrounding the federal
commitment. Washington moved to protect the salmon only because
environmental advocacy groups threatened to sue if it did not _ an
exact replay of the campaign to save the spotted owl. By listing
the salmon as threatened, the Clinton administration has now
saddled itself with an even more onerous responsibility _ insuring
that Washington and Oregon develop an effective plan to save the
fish. Vice President Al Gore has promised a special appropriation
of $100 million to underwrite a ``cooperative restoration effort.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the states falter, Washington would be obliged under the
Endangered Species Act to step in with a variety of legal and
regulatory weapons that, in effect, could halt development in its
tracks.
</P>
<P>
   An early test of this commitment will come in the next few
months when the administration delivers its long-awaited proposal
for restoring several species of salmon in the Snake River that
were listed as endangered or threatened back in 1991 and 1992. Some
scientists believe that these species will never recover unless the
federal government dismantles or at least modifies eight dams on
the Snake and Columbia Rivers _ a strategy unalterably opposed by
many big consumers of electricity and by Washington's powerful
Republican senator, Slade Gorton.
</P>
<P>
   The administration may find other ways to restore the
fresh-water flows essential to the salmon's survival. But what
matters here is the end result _ recovery. How the administration
responds will tell much about its long-term dedication to the other
species listed this week.

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, March 17:
</P>
<P>
   A congressional hearing on the Supreme Court's annual budget
last week took a valuable detour as Justices Clarence Thomas and
David Souter engaged in a lengthy colloquy with lawmakers about the
court's dismal record in recruiting and hiring minority law clerks.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the nine justices personally selects up to four law
clerks each term to help with screening appeals and drafting
opinions.
</P>
<P>
   The current term's crop of 34 clerks includes only one minority
member _ a Hispanic woman _ and for the second year running, the
court hired no African-American clerks. Of the 428 clerks hired
over the years by the current justices, only 7 have been black,
according to figures compiled by USA Today. Chief Justice William
Rehnquist has not hired even one African-American clerk in 27 years
on the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not a person at the court who would not want to
change this,'' said Justice Thomas, the second African-American to
sit on the court, responding to questioning by Democratic
lawmakers. Justice Souter also expressed displeasure with the
lopsided numbers and the perception they create. But other comments
by the two justices suggested a reluctance to alter the clubby
``feeder system'' from top-tier law schools and judges that
produces a nearly all-white coterie of high-caliber clerks.
</P>
<P>
   The court is hurting itself and the country by perpetuating a
selection process that seems to exclude minorities and the
disparate views they might bring. If the justices wanted greater
diversity, they could achieve it without diminishing the high
standards they need to use for hiring. Leon Higginbotham, the
distinguished federal appellate jurist who died recently, made it a
point to seek out able minority clerks, and had little trouble
finding them.

   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, March 18:
</P>
<P>
   By balking at a reasonable peace plan and sending more combat
forces into Kosovo, Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian leader, is
pushing the United States and its NATO allies to the brink of
military conflict in the Balkans. Unless Milosevic retreats at the
last minute, which he has done before, American missiles and NATO
warplanes could be attacking Serbian targets within a matter of
days.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and European leaders will be justified in
doing so because Milosevic has arrogantly defied every effort to
end the Kosovo conflict on terms that ought to be acceptable both
to Serbia and to the ethnic Albanians who account for more than 90
percent of Kosovo's population. The latest diplomatic casualty of
Milosevic's aggression may be the peace talks convened by the
United States, its European partners and Russia, which are aimed at
agreement on a plan to return the province to self-government by
the ethnic Albanians. Serbian military and police forces would have
to leave Kosovo in a year. The negotiations in France are likely to
end in failure Thursday because Milosevic suddenly demanded
unacceptable changes in the proposed agreement and has refused to
approve the presence of a NATO peacekeeping force in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Another peace plan shattered by Milosevic was the deal he made
last October with the American envoy Richard Holbrooke. Faced with
the threat of NATO air strikes, the Serbian leader agreed to pull
troops out of Kosovo, stop the shelling and killing of civilians
and give full access to war crimes investigators, among other
actions. He has broken all those promises. Serbia now has more than
30,000 troops in or around Kosovo. Tanks and armored personnel
carriers are streaming in. Thousands of ethnic Albanian residents
have fled their villages to escape shelling. Wednesday Serbia shut
down two Albanian-language newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   NATO should not undertake bombing casually, especially to change
the way a government treats its own citizens. But in this case,
NATO must be united in carrying out its threat. If Milosevic does
not immediately stop attacking ethnic Albanians and agree to the
peace plan, bombing is the appropriate response.

SAUDI PLAN TO CUT PRODUCTION PUSHES CRUDE OIL PRICES HIGHER
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By AGIS SALPUKAS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Crude oil futures surged Wednesday, with prices nearing a
five-month high, after Saudi Aramco, the state-owned oil company in
Saudi Arabia, said it would cut sales of crude oil to all its major
clients by 12 percent April 1.
</P>
<P>
   A much larger-than-expected drop in gasoline inventories in the
United States and reports that Russia would also cut production
also contributed to the rise.
</P>
<P>
   Crude oil for April delivery was up 59 cents, or 4.1 percent,
closing at $15.05 a barrel in trading on the New York Mercantile
Exchange _ its highest closing price since Oct. 7. And on the
London International Petroleum Exchange, oil futures for delivery
in May were up by 59 cents, to $13.27 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   The rise in crude oil comes as gasoline prices at the pump,
falling since October, have shown a slight increase, according to a
survey released this week by the American Automobile Association.
</P>
<P>
   The average price of self-serve regular gasoline rose by one
cent, to 97 cents, in March _ the first increase since October. It
was still 11.1 cents lower than the average price in March last
year. The survey was based on 65,000 gasoline transactions from
March 12 through March 15.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts have predicted that gasoline prices could rise by
five cents or more because of the higher crude oil prices. There
could also be attempts by refiners and station owners to put
through price increases more quickly than actual changes in crude
oil prices would warrant to increase their profits, which have been
under pressure.
</P>
<P>
   The stance by Saudi Aramco re-affirmed the Saudis' commitment,
made Friday, to cut their production by 585,000 barrels a day. That
pledge was part of an effort by a coalition of major oil producers
who vowed to cut output by a total of two million barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts called the step a major concession by the Saudis,
who have refused to limit their output to fewer than eight million
barrels a day. Analysts added that it was a major reason why other
producers were willing to make their cuts and why the cuts would
stand.
</P>
<P>
   Other major oil producers have been upset with Saudi Arabia for
increasing its market share after the gulf war at the expense of
Iraq, then not cutting back even as Iraq began to export two
million barrels a day. The Iraqi exports are being made through a
special allowance for humanitarian aid under the sanctions imposed
by the United Nations.

LAME-DUCK COACH GIVES IOWA AN `EDGE' AGAINST UCONN
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ If they stop to think about it, the Iowa players are
already feeling deprived over the pending departure of their coach,
Tom Davis, whose contract is running out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's never been a distraction, but maybe it's a subconscious
reason to fight,'' said Kent McCausland, the senior shooter.
``Sure, you think about things like, `This is the last time I'll
play Illinois.' It gives you a little edge. You're always looking
for a little edge.''
</P>
<P>
   Iowa, seeded fifth in the West Regional, will need some edge
Thursday night when it runs into top-seeded Connecticut in the
Round of 16 of the National Collegiate Athletic Association
tournament. In the first game of the doubleheader, 10th-seeded
Gonzaga meets sixth-seeded Florida.
</P>
<P>
   This is obviously a year of upsets, a year of parity, a year of
edges. But only Iowa is playing with a coach who has known for
nearly a year that he would not be retained after this season. The
athletic director, Bob Bowlsby, has not explained why he did not
retain the 60-year-old Davis, and there seems to be no leeway for
reconsideration.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are always critics,'' Davis said Wednesday. ``The
grandmothers will write you: `Play these kids. Get on the officials
more. Get onto the court.'''
</P>
<P>
   Davis is an extremely popular coach who had successful terms at
Lafayette, Boston College and Stanford before coming here 12 years
ago. He is relatively short, white-thatched and rational, as well
as the possessor of a Ph.D. in history. He has the reputation as a
gentleman, which has held up as reporters badgered him to say
something crabby or controversial about his dismissal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not something I would use as a tool,'' Davis said, ``but
I haven't ducked it or anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis tries to convince people that his players are not affected
by his status. ``Maybe it's an issue in their minds,'' he said,
``but if you work with 18-year-olds the way I do, you know that the
exuberance of being here overwhelms a lot of other things. They
have been responsive. They pay close attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of his seniors say they are most definitely thinking about
Davis. ``He gave you a chance to play Big 10 basketball,''
McCausland said. ``You enjoy playing golf with him in the summer. I
feel like I'm being robbed a little, after I graduate.''
</P>
<P>
   Jess Settles, the burly senior, said: ``He's going to clean out
the office. I hope I'm not around when he does it. It's always nice
when guys can come back to meet the coach _ to get free tickets, if
nothing else. The coach is the university. That's why you go to a
university. When you come back, you want to swing into coach's
office.''
</P>
<P>
   That will not happen for McCausland and Settles at Iowa, but
Davis just might be coaching somewhere else. Davis said he did not
want to think about his next step until the season is over because
``most of us are wiped out, even the younger guys. You just want to
take time off and reflect.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis was sanguine about his tough game against Jim Calhoun, the
Connecticut coach, who raved about Davis' innovations with the
pressing defense and also praised Davis as a ``role model'' for not
grousing in public.
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun needs to get past his colleague in his quest to reach
the Final Four for the first time. Davis has never been there,
either. His Iowa teams have qualified for this tournament in nine
of his 12 seasons, previously losing to Nevada-Las Vegas, Arizona,
North Carolina State, Duke, Wake Forest and Kentucky, none of them
outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, his next loss with the Hawkeyes will be his last.
And his next public complaint will be his first.

HOW HERBIE CAN SAVE THE BALLPARK AT ARLINGTON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Save us, Herb.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Mr. Kelleher, only you can bring some form of dignity to an
otherwise disgusting process.
</P>
<P>
   Herb, I'm talking about The Ballpark in Arlington. About the
selling of the naming rights of this cathedral, this shrine, this
Venice of all ballyards.
</P>
<P>
   The plane is making it's final approach, Herb. In protest, we
could ask for volunteers to be tied to the runway _ but who cleans
up the mess?
</P>
<P>
   As of this week, the landing gear is locked. Herb, your pals at
American Airlines have come with the cash, and the new downtown
Dallas sports arena will forever be known as...
</P>
<P>
   Really, it's not so bad. American Airlines Arena. But Tom Hicks,
who has half a say on the arena, is the lone voice when it comes to
The Ballpark. And his next major business transaction will be
selling that name.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sacrilege,'' I say. ``A down-payment for Curt Schilling,''
Hicks says.
</P>
<P>
   Those of us on the losing end of the argument can now only hope
that Weed-Eater, Drano, and Listerine aren't under consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Already around the country there's such silliness as National
Rental Car Stadium, PSINet Stadium, 3Comm Park, Qualcomm Stadium
... they all have such a nice ring, don't you think?
</P>
<P>
   But none of those were exactly classic structures to begin with.
To cheese-up something like The Ballpark in Arlington would leave a
permanent scar on Hicks' otherwise stellar ownership credentials of
the Rangers and Stars.
</P>
<P>
   This is where Herb Kelleher, head of Southwest Airlines can come
fly with us. Gas up the company plane and reach for the hip pocket,
Herb.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest Airlines Ballpark in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   Better yet, take out ``Airlines.'' Make it just ``Southwest
Ballpark in Arlington.''
</P>
<P>
   That's you, Herb. And at least some geographical flavor is
involved. I can live with it.
</P>
<P>
   And don't anybody else come around here preaching that a man who
pays $250 million for a team and ballpark can name it anything he
wants. Don't give me that Jerry Jones stuff about he can wander the
sidelines and swap sweat with Nine-Toed Deion if he so desires.
</P>
<P>
   Public money built the ballpark. Just because your title reads
``owner'' doesn't mean you have the right to make a fool of
yourself or the hallowed grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks said from the start he would sell the rights in Arlington,
but would do so in the name of dignity. He did so with the Dallas
arena, but there's never been an arena to ever compare to this
ballpark, because even the new ones are basically all the same.
Junior Perot and Hicks will deliver the first class goods in
Dallas, but it won't be different.
</P>
<P>
   The Ballpark in Arlington was built to be a one-and-only, and
is.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, I blame Kevin Brown for this cultural disaster. Then
again, I blame everything on the former Rangers pitcher and
snot-ball. If Brown wasn't signing hundred million dollar-plus
contracts, commerical names attached to ballparks wouldn't be
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   I haven't figured out yet how to finger Brown for American
Airlines Arena in Dallas. But in time I'll think of something.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal American cut with Perot and Hicks is said to be for a
base financial package of $90 million for 20 years, and then it may
go twice that much with other promotional opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   One person familiar with these kinds of transactions said
yesterday the name-selling of The Ballpark would fetch at least
that, probably more. But another voice disagreed, with his estimate
being The Ballpark topping out at $3 million a season for the base
package.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the amount, Mr. Kelleher can afford it, plus he can
trump his rival airline, plus ``Southwest Ballpark in Arlington''
is almost a turbulence-free flight.
</P>
<P>
   True confession:
</P>
<P>
   At first, I hated The Ballpark in Arlington for a name. The
summer day it was announced seven years ago, George W. Bush
wandered into the Arlington Stadium press box seeking reaction,
which was mostly all negative.
</P>
<P>
   As the Rangers' managing general partner, Bush had also just
announced his candidacy for governor against the incumbent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, what do you think we should have named it?'' George
barked at me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ann Richards Field,'' I barked back.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has never let me forget that two years later I was praising
the name. OK, it grew on me. I love The Ballpark in Arlington, both
in name and structure.
</P>
<P>
   With help from Herb, not much would have to change.

DONALDSON, LUFKIN MAKES A MOVE UP MERGER CHARTS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Business has been so good for the investment bankers
at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette lately, even they can hardly
believe it.
</P>
<P>
   Donaldson, Lufkin, which rarely holds a top spot among
mergers-and-acquisitions advisers, has made an impressive showing
so far this year, advising on several recent high-profile deals.
According to the Securities Data Co., Donaldson, Lufkin now ranks
third in dollar volume of worldwide transactions through Wednesday,
a far cry from its seventh-place showing this time last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five years ago, we weren't as focused on mergers and
acquisitions,'' said Hal Ritch, global co-head of the firm's merger
department. Since then, Donaldson, Lufkin, which is 74 percent
owned by the Equitable Co., a unit of the French insurer AXA SA,
``has intelligently grown as an investment banking shop.''
</P>
<P>
   The firm has been on a hiring binge over the last five years,
expanding its banking staff almost fourfold. It has aggressively
wooed bankers from competitors like Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.,
Wasserstein Perella &AMP; Co. and Lazard Freres. In the financial
services arena, for instance, Donaldson, Lufkin hired a team of
bankers from UBS Securities last year.
</P>
<P>
   Those investments are beginning to pay off. At this time last
year, Donaldson, Lufkin had advised on only $39 billion worth of
mergers. This year, its total is $136 billion and spans several
industries.
</P>
<P>
   The firm has advised two Dutch insurers, including Aegon NV on
its $9.7 billion deal for the TransAmerica Corp. It also played a
key role in Allied Waste Industries' recent $9 billion buyout of
Browning-Ferris Industries and the Adelphia Communications Corp.'s
$3.6 billion merger with the Century Communications Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at their strategy, they have always focused on
niche, high-margin businesses that come up and surprise people,''
said Henry McVey, an analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. On
Tuesday, McVey raised his stock price target for the company to $72
from $64 in the next 12 months, in part because of the industry's
pickup in merger business as well as growth in Donaldson, Lufkin's
online brokerage service, DLJ Direct.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Donaldson, Lufkin said Wednesday that it planned to file
an initial public offering of stock that will track the performance
of its online business. The firm's shares dropped $3.0625
Wednesday, or 4.5 percent, to $65.75, in part because of
uncertainty about the tracking stock.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   McVey said that the company was also starting to profit from
relationships in Europe as well as other departments, including its
high-yield and bank-loan divisions. And its business of processing
trades for other companies should keep providing steady pretax
profit margins _ as much as 25 percent, McVey said.
</P>
<P>
   Security Data's current rankings include other surprises. Lazard
Freres has moved up from eighth place to fourth. Merrill Lynch, No.
1 this time last year, has fallen to sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill lost out when its client, the Bell Atlantic Corp. failed
to buy Airtouch Communications after Vodafone Group PLC came in
with a higher bid. So far this year, Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. and
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, perennial heavyweights, are No. 1 and
No. 2, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Another surprise is Citigroup's Salomon Smith Barney unit, which
has slipped from No. 5 last year to No. 12 in merger advice. In a
twist, two ex-Salomon bankers now at Donaldson, Lufkin are advising
Olivetti in its $60 billion hostile bid for Telecom Italia.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the recent flurry of activity, Ritch acknowledged that
no one knows who will end this year atop the rankings. ``We don't
stay up at night worrying,'' he said.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   VLADIVOSTOK, Russia _ It is well after dark on a recent evening,
but the red brick garment factory on a bluff overlooking the Sea of
Japan is ablaze with light. From inside the building comes a
haunting song, unfamiliar in this overwhelmingly Russian city: The
seamstresses are singing in Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   Of the many incongruities born of the increasingly complex
global economy, this may be among the strangest. For here at
Russia's eastern extremity, Chinese workers labor alongside
Russians making clothes for a South Korean company, which put its
factory here partly to do an end run around U.S. quotas on apparel
imports.
</P>
<P>
   And Russia, which had visions of reinventing itself as a
world-class market economy, now finds itself in the company of
nations like Indonesia and El Salvador, attractive to outside
investors in part for its rock-bottom wages. Seamstresses here
often work six days a week, and for as little as 11 cents an hour.
</P>
<P>
   The factory is owned by S.H. International, one of a growing
number of South Korean companies making clothes in Russia, in this
case T-shirts and sweatshirts, that often end up in American stores
like the Gap.
</P>
<P>
   Similar factories have popped up in 10 cities in the Russian far
east, from the hardscrabble town of Partizansk, where three of the
four coal mines have closed in the last two years, to Vladivostok,
a port city of 700,000 that until 1992 was off-limits to
foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   American apparel companies have long farmed out work to
manufacturers in low-wage countries. But in an elaborate global
system known as the Multi-Fiber Arrangement, which is supposed to
be dismantled by 2005, the United States, like Europe, established
restrictions on imports from countries whose exports were thought
to threaten the domestic apparel industry. South Korean textile
companies, limited by American quotas for decades, have sent their
cloth to be sewn in faraway factories in the Caribbean and Latin
America, which face no such quotas. But now South Koreans are
finding a new place to set up shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Through other countries such as Russia you can enter the
United States essentially through the back door,'' said Charles
Kernaghan, director of the National Labor Committee, an industry
watchdog group based in New York.
</P>
<P>
   For Russia, the apparel companies are a double-edged sword. They
provide jobs in a region desperate for investment, and in some
cases they reopen closed Soviet-era factories. But some critics
fear that the presence of Chinese laborers living on factory
grounds is an invitation for the sweatshop conditions common to
many South Korean factories in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not much good in the whole arrangement, but there's a
deficit of jobs here,'' said Alexander Prosekov, deputy chairman of
the Committee for Industry in the Primorye Regional Administration,
which includes Vladivostok. ``At least they pay salaries
regularly.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States is unlikely to object to the imports from
Russia. A Commerce Department official, who spoke on the condition
of anonymity, said the practice was legal as long as there was
``substantial transformation'' of the clothing in Russia.
Furthermore, she said, the United States will not impose any
serious quotas on Russia as long as imports do not harm American
industry. While the United States does set limits on imports of
women's coats, there are no such limits on the production of
clothing of the sort made here, polo shirts, sweatshirts and
sweaters, which is growing domestically as well.
</P>
<P>
   Vladivostok is only 440 miles from Seoul, South Korea, but it
offers a bargain-rate work force. The average hourly cost of an
apparel industry employee in South Korea in 1998 was $2.69,
including wages, taxes and benefits, according to industry figures.
Though that seems stingy compared with the $10.12 U.S. average, the
average Russian hourly cost is just 56 cents.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian figure is less than half that of Guatemala, where
the majority of sewing factories are owned by South Koreans, and
comparable to China's, where employers say apparel workers cost an
average of 43 cents an hour. But exports from Russia, unlike those
from China, face few trade restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   These figures, low as they are, probably do not reflect the true
take-home pay, according to the National Labor Committee, which has
studied wage rates in China and Latin America. And Eastern workers
earn far below the industry averages for Russia. Russian
seamstresses at S.H. International, for example, earned 21 cents an
hour on average when the regional administration's Committee for
Industry last surveyed local wages in October. The average Chinese
worker at S.H. earned 11 cents an hour. S.H.'s general director,
Hak Lee, declined to discuss specific figures at the factory.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of outsourcing _ farming out work to outside
manufacturers _ is a sensitive one for American companies, which
have been criticized over labor practices of their producers
abroad. A Gap Inc. spokeswoman, Kristy Van Koughnet, declined to
answer questions about the company's suppliers in Russia and said
that questions relating to employment practices should be addressed
to the factories in Russia. ``Anything about where we outsource is
considered proprietary information,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   After a reporter asked about conditions in Russian factories,
Gap sent officials to look at several sites. At a plant in
Partizansk, workers then began receiving free lunch in the canteen,
and the company increased wages. After the raise, one worker said
she received $49.56 for a month that included several six-day work
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The apparel makers have set up shop in unlikely places.
Partizansk, a town of 65,000 three hours by car from Vladivostok,
might not seem an ideal multinational manufacturing and trade
center. Pensioners wheezing from black lung disease pick through
heaps of stones outside abandoned mine shafts, looking for coal to
burn.
</P>
<P>
   But the Seoul-based Seishin Apparel Co. bought and remodeled a
bankrupt Soviet-era clothing factory there in 1997 for $760,000 to
expand sales in America, its general director, Joo In Ha, said. The
Russian subsidiary, Koruss, sold $1.68 million worth of
sweatshirts, dresses and polo shirts to Gap in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Vera Karas, a manager at Koruss, said the regional
administration initially resisted the company, fearing it might
exploit workers. ``But that's not going to happen,'' she said. Ms.
Karas, who worked at the factory when it was Russian-owned, said
that the Korean owners treated employees well and hired some
Russian managers, like her. Since last May, she added, wages have
more than doubled. (When figured in dollars, though, they have
actually fallen as the ruble collapsed.)
</P>
<P>
   Some 600 cutters, seamstresses and others work at tables in
Koruss' warehouse-sized rooms, cutting piles of fabric and sewing
dresses, sweatshirts, sweaters and polo shirts. Most of them are
Russian women; some of the new hires are Chinese. They regularly
work five 9- or 10-hour days, and often spend Saturdays at the
sewing machines as well. Koruss employees are paid extra for
overtime work, but at S.H. International in Vladivostok, workers
said their overtime pay per hour was less than their regular hourly
pay.
</P>
<P>
   While filling a big order in November, Koruss employees worked
several seven-day weeks, they said. (Ms. Karas said this was
untrue.)
</P>
<P>
   ``You can only go to the toilet when a bell rings,'' said a
19-year-old former Koruss employee who quit after a month. ``If
they catch you talking, you get in trouble.'' She added:
``Sometimes we didn't leave until 7 p.m. For those who have
families, I don't know how they do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some employees, however, say the work is very welcome. Lyubov
Vonyagina, 54, a veteran seamstress, is part of a team that must
produce 1,900 T-shirts a day. When they fall short, they stay late.
Still, Ms. Vonyagina says she is not overworked, and she scoffs at
younger workers who complain. ``They aren't used to hard work,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to hire Chinese workers has stirred up anger in
some factory towns. City officials in Artyom, 22 miles north of
Vladivostok, have criticized a request by Newmax Apparel of South
Korea to hire 75 Chinese workers, the daily Vladivostok newspaper
reported on Tuesday. Officials also asked the company to double
wages and stop requiring seamstresses to work overtime.
</P>
<P>
   In Partizansk, Koruss imported 75 ethnic Koreans from
northeastern China because, said Joo, the general director, there
are simply not enough skilled workers in Partizansk to fill orders.
But some townspeople are hostile to the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't need the Chinese here,'' said Lyudmila Samoilova, 43,
a single mother of five who runs a newspaper kiosk across the
street from Koruss. ``There aren't enough jobs for our own
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Nina Gudozhnikova, director of the Partizansk office of the
federal employment service, worries that because Chinese workers at
home put in 12-hour days and get only two days off a month, the
South Korean factories in Russia will impose similar schedules on
its workers. Still, she approved the factory's labor agreement
because the women of Partizansk need jobs. ``I signed this
agreement with serious doubts,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In Vladivostok, at S.H. International, which is owned by Sunghan
Co., 227 Russians work alongside 220 Chinese employees, according
to Sergei Kurakin, chairman of the regional Committee for Industry.
Two women from China said they lived on the plant site and worked
about 10 hours a day. Like many Chinese traders and workers in the
Russian far east, they say they will be here only for a short time.
</P>
<P>
   Russian workers said the Chinese struck for two days in December
because of low wages. But the Chinese, who said they could get in
trouble for talking about their work, declined to discuss the
matter. ``Basically, I came to Russia out of curiosity, as well as
to earn some money,'' one seamstress said.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when most unpaid Russian workers survive on what they
can grow in their gardens or borrow from their pensioner parents,
many seamstresses are grateful that South Korean companies are
investing in the region. Others say they simply must take whatever
work they can get. A 30-year-old mother of two complained of a
dirty work environment, and of a boss who blocked the doors at S.H.
and refused to allow employees to leave at the end of their shift.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, the general director, said, ``I didn't do that.'' Like
other South Korean companies, S.H. said it followed Russian labor
laws.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the worker who complained plans to keep showing up
on the job. ``We have no choice,'' she said. ``We either have to
sit at home and go hungry, or go to work in these conditions.''

VAUGHN STRUGGLING AT PLATE

   TEMPE, Ariz. _ Another day, another hitless day.
</P>
<P>
   Mo Vaughn went 0 for 3 in the Anaheim Angels' 3-1 victory over
the Milwaukee Brewers Wednesday afternoon at Tempe Diablo Stadium,
dropping his spring average to .192 (5 for 26).
</P>
<P>
   He has not hit a home run and has only one extra-base hit
(double). He has struck out a team-leading eight times. Nobody,
though, is worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not worried about my offense, ever,'' Vaughn said. ``The
only thing I worry about is defense and my defense has been fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn made a few nice plays on hard grounders Wednesday and has
been good in the field all spring. The offense, Vaughn insists,
will be there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still look at spring training as a time to get yourself in
shape,'' he said. ``Get a good routine going. You'll see a
different player when the season comes. You become a different
player as you get older because you understand what you need to do
to get ready. You see a lot of bad swings in Arizona, it's just
something you have to work through.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Spring training in Arizona is a lot different than spring
training in Florida,'' manager Terry Collins said, noting Vaughn's
first year playing in the Cactus League. ``That's an adjustment
itself. He's been taking extra batting practice every day. He comes
to the cage and works with (hitting coach) Rod (Carew).''
</P>
<P>
   Belcher sharp: Starting pitcher Tim Belcher went five innings
Wednesday, giving up one run and eight hits while making 58
pitches. After his outing, he threw a simulated inning in the
bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Belcher was happy with his performance, but laughed when he
heard the radio announcer say Belcher ``went five strong innings.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so funny, he said. ``You give up eight hits, but because
only one touched the plate, they say `five  &UR; !ital! &LR; strong &UR; !off! &LR; 
innings.'
</P>
<P>
   Extra work for Salmon: Tim Salmon, who had two hits against the
Brewers, will go to the minor-league camp in Mesa today to get some
extra at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon traditionally has been a slow starter, but for the past
couple of seasons he's tried to get extra work in during the spring
in order to start the season better. Collins said Salmon might get
10 or 15 at-bats today.
</P>
<P>
   This and that: Former Angels pitcher Jim Abbott, now with the
Brewers, did not make the trip for Wednesday's game. In three
starts, Abbott is 1-0 with a 2.38 ERA and has walked only one in
111/3 innings.... The Angels will host a ceremony today renaming
their spring facility Gene Autry Field at Tempe Diablo Stadium....
Pitcher Chuck Finley will make his second start of the spring
Sunday against the Oakland A's.... The Angels and Brewers wore
green caps for St. Patrick's Day. Said Collins: ``This is America.
You're supposed to be able to wear green caps on St. Patrick's Day.
But I'm glad tomorrow's not St. Patrick's Day.''

<P>
   KNOXVILLE, Tenn. _ It was during the long, lonely rides across
Texas that Steve Francis had his doubts.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was on those six-hour junior college bus trips from,
like, Houston to Brownsville, I didn't think it would happen,''
Francis said. ``I had so much stuff to think about.''
</P>
<P>
   So much stuff before the 21-year-old Francis, Maryland's
peripatetic guard, would wend his way through an extraordinary
odyssey to become a sure-fire NBA lottery pick if he enters the
draft after this season.
</P>
<P>
   From the oblivion of those junior college days, Francis has a
starring role Thursday in a much-anticipated South Regional
semifinal game between the second-seeded Terrapins (28-5) and
third-seeded St. John's (27-8).
</P>
<P>
   The second part of the NCAA doubleheader has top-seeded Auburn
facing fourth-seeded Ohio State.
</P>
<P>
   Francis, a junior averaging 17.2 points and 4.6 assists, toiled
in obscurity for years before bursting onto the college basketball
highlight reel this season with gravity-defying lean-in dunks so
spectacular that they caught the eye of St. John's Ron Artest.
</P>
<P>
   Artest had never heard of Francis before this year. But few had,
save the hoops junkie trolling the Internet and the NBA scouts who
descended on little Allegany Community College in western Maryland
last season.
</P>
<P>
   It was hard to keep a bead on the moving player, so perhaps the
Red Storm is still not fully aware of the Francis phenomenon.
Perhaps St. John's has not seen enough of the 43-inch vertical leap
or appreciates the 93 steals this season _ the fifth-highest
single-season total in Atlantic Coast Conference history _ or heard
that Francis was a second-team all-ACC pick before he had played a
single game.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can contain him, without those high-flying dunks, he's
just an average player,'' said St. John's forward Lavor Postell,
who will likely be one of the players trying to guard him.
</P>
<P>
   Containing Francis, who primarily plays shooting guard although
he came to Maryland as a point guard, is precisely the problem. His
journey from Takoma Park, Md., to the University of Maryland in
College Park, just five minutes away _ which includes stops at two
high schools, one prep school, a firehouse and two junior colleges
_ means he has not been followed by the buzz of the next anointed
star.
</P>
<P>
   College Park is Francis' sixth campus in six years. He played
just one year of high school ball as a sophomore, mostly as a
third-string point, missing the other three seasons because of
academic problems, injuries and transfers.
</P>
<P>
   When he was a senior, the death of his mother, Brenda, from
cancer at age 39, left Francis so despondent that he stopped going
to school. Later, he went to a Connecticut prep school, but left it
because he couldn't afford to pay the tuition.
</P>
<P>
   That was nearly the end. At 18, Francis was working toward a
high school equivalency degree and playing pick-up games in the
basement of a firehouse near his Takoma Park home against teams
stocked largely with firemen. He was on the precipice of losing the
dreams his mother told him never to give up.
</P>
<P>
   Francis' break came when he was invited to join the Maryland
Amateur Athletic Union team that played in the 19-and-under
nationals in 1996 in Winter Park, Fla. He made the all-tournament
team and got a scholarship to the junior college powerhouse, San
Jacinto College in Texas. He took the team to the 1997 national
junior college final, where they lost to Iowa's Indian Hills.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But it was only last winter, when Francis transferred to
Allegany in Cumberland, Md., because he was homesick, that the
legend began to bloom. Francis became the first guard to lead two
junior college teams to undefeated seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I went to the junior college championships, they were
putting two and three guys on me,'' Francis said, ``so I knew it
wasn't going to be the last time I played basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a firm believer in God, and all the nights I prayed, all
the times I wondered when it was going to happen. It's slowly
coming true. Where I came from there is always someone better.
Since I got the chance to represent where I came from, I thought
I'd take advantage of it.''
</P>
<P>
   When Francis brought his springy legs, a wicked crossover
dribble and a tattoo in memory of his mother _ he rubs it before
every free throw _ to Maryland, the hype spread through basketball
circles. After all, during the summer league he dunked over Chris
Webber in a pickup game, didn't he, and dunked three times in a
row.
</P>
<P>
   So great were the expectations that there was concern his
teammates would resent him and suspect he was there just to
showcase his talent and move on yet again. But Francis moved
seemlessly into an already talented team, playing both guard
positions, becoming an integral part of the Terrapins' pressure
defense and quickly shooting down a broadcast report that he is
going to the NBA after this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I liked was his willingness to blend in with the rest of
the players,'' Maryland coach Gary Williams said. ``He's not
averaging many more shots than anybody else. If you watch ESPN, you
think he just dunks at the end of transition.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last eight games, Francis is averaging 21.9 points and is
shooting 62.4 percent from the field, an enormous part of a
Maryland offense that thrives on the turnovers its pressure defense
causes. But Artest refuted Postell's theory that if you take away
the dunks, Francis can be stopped.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen him crossing people over and he's very active on the
boards,'' Artest said. ``I don't think you can take him out of his
game.''
</P>
<P>
   St. John's coach Mike Jarvis said: ``He's a highlight film. I'm
probably not going to sleep all night trying to think about how to
stop him. The kid is one of the top five prospects in the country.
How many weaknesses can he have?''
</P>
<P>
   Not many, especially now that Francis has earned the respect of
one person who knows how to stop him one on one, the person who
recognized his talent when their games were the only games Francis
was playing: his older brother Terry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was intimidated by going up against him,'' Francis said.
``He was the high school player of the year on defense his junior
and senior years. He has a lot of respect for my game now, too.
Now, I don't think there's anybody who can stop me individually.'' &QL;

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A retired two-star Army general who admitted to
committing adultery with the wives of four subordinates was ordered
Wednesday to pay $22,000 in penalties but was spared a prison
sentence after his lawyer argued that his client's valor in Vietnam
outweighed his misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   The defendant, Maj. Gen. David R.E. Hale, was reprimanded, fined
$10,000 and ordered to forfeit $1,000 a month for a year from his
$6,312-a-month pension. He could have been sent to prison for up to
11 years.
</P>
<P>
   The sentence was imposed Wednesday at Fort Lewis, Wash., by Col.
Stephen Saynisch, the presiding judge at Hale's court-martial. It
must be reviewed by the commanding officer of the First Corps and
Fort Lewis, Lt. Gen. George A. Crocker, before it becomes final.
</P>
<P>
   Crocker may reduce the sentence but cannot impose a more severe
one, according to Capt. Tanya Schierling, a legal liaison officer
to the fort's public affairs office.
</P>
<P>
   Hale, 53, was the highest-ranking officer to be court-martialed
since 1952. Prosecutors had asked for a $125,000 fine and a $1,466
monthly deduction from his pension. The lead prosecutor, Maj.
Michael Mulligan, had urged time in prison ``to send a message
there is no difference between the lowliest private and a
general.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Justice has in fact been served,'' said Donald Mancuso, the
Defense Department inspector general who oversaw the initial
investigation, asserting at a news conference that Hale's case
would ``cause other officers to think twice.''
</P>
<P>
   But Representative Nita M. Lowey, a New York Democrat, had a
different view. ``This slap on the wrist raises serious questions
about the Pentagon's commitment to equal justice,'' she said
tonight. ``We cannot have one standard for the brass and another
for the enlisted.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lowey was highly critical of the Air Force's treatment of
First Lieut. Kelly Flinn, who was given a less than honorable
discharge from the Air Force on charges of adultery and lying about
it.
</P>
<P>
   Before sentencing, Hale told the court, ``I cannot express
adequately how sorry I am, how embarrassed I am, for the pain I
have brought the U.S. Army, my fellow soldiers and my family and
friends.''
</P>
<P>
   The general had agreed on Tuesday to plead guilty to eight
counts of misconduct stemming from his adulterous relationships. He
admitted one count of making false official statements, by lying to
the Pentagon's deputy inspector-general, and seven counts of
conduct unbecoming an officer and gentleman, for having ``improper
relations while married'' with the wives of four subordinates, for
denying it to one of the husbands and for misleading the Army's
inspector general about the accusations.
</P>
<P>
   The Army agreed to drop 11 other counts, including one that
accused him of threatening one of the women that he would testify
against her in a child-custody case.
</P>
<P>
   Had he been convicted on all the original charges, Hale could
have faced 56 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The general told the court that his life began to fall apart
when his marriage ended after nearly three decades. He was accused
of preying upon the wives of subordinates in Turkey from 1996 to
1998, singling out women he thought were having their own marital
troubles.
</P>
<P>
   The general's fall from grace ended what had once been a
brilliant career: he won a Silver Star for valor in Vietnam, was
appointed deputy inspector general of the Army in 1996 and seemed
well on his way to winning a third star.
</P>
<P>
   When he was allowed to retire honorably a year ago, even though
the wife of a subordinate had filed a complaint accusing him of an
improper sexual relationship, the Army came under intense
criticism. Some saw a double standard, since lower-ranking officers
and enlisted men and women in the Army and other services had been
drummed out of uniform or forced to give up some retirement
benefits for sexual transgressions.
</P>
<P>
   A case pointed to was that of Sgt. Maj. Gene McKinney, then the
Army's highest-ranking enlisted man, who was reduced in rank and
reprimanded after a court-martial convicted him of obstruction of
justice last year in a sexual misconduct case, The Associated Press
reported.
</P>
<P>
   The furor over Hale prompted Defense Secretary William S. Cohen
to decree a change in military retirement policy, barring officers
accused of misconduct from retiring until the charges against them
are resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Before his guilty plea, Hale had maintained his innocence. He
changed his plea, said his lawyer, Frank J. Spinner, out of a
desire to bring the case ``to a swift conclusion'' and ``to protect
the Army, himself and others from embarrassment and pain.''
Wednesday, Spinner asked Saynisch to consider the general's heroism
in Vietnam and embarrassment in deciding upon a sentence.
</P>
<P>
   The charges stemmed from accusations by Donnamaria Carpino,
whose husband was a colonel at the NATO base at Izmir, Turkey,
where Hale served as deputy commander of all NATO ground forces for
southeastern Europe. She accused the general of trumping up
adultery charges against her husband, then promising not to pursue
them if she agreed to have sex.
</P>
<P>
   A Pentagon investigation found that the relationship between Ms.
Carpino and Hale was consensual, not coerced. That investigation
also uncovered ``a pattern of inappropriate behavior'' involving
the other women and misuse of travel expenses.
