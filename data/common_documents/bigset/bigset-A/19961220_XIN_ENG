<HEADLINE> Russian Nuclear Bomb Father Khariton Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Yuly Khariton, one of the
"fathers" of the Soviet (or Russian) nuclear weapons, died
today at the age of 92, the state-run Itar-Tass news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Khariton died at 05:00 Moscow time (02:00 GMT) in his home in
Sarov, or Arzamas-16, in Russia's Nizhny Novgorod. Arzamas-16 had
been one of the Russian "closed" cities.
</P>
<P>
The scientist, who had been the head of the nuclear research
center in Arzamas-16 for 45 years, made great contribution in the
development of the first Soviet atomic bomb in the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
In 1939, he, in conjunction with Yakov Zeldovich, for the first
time calculated the chain reaction of uranium fission.
</P>
<P>
Although he was second only to Igor Kurchatov among the
"fathers" of the Soviet nuclear weapons, the general public heard
his name for the first time only a few years ago since his name
had been part of classified information as everything he was doing.
</P>
<P>
"The entire life of this many-sided scientist and
indefatigable working man was given to nuclear physics. But he
never liked talking about his work," said Academician Vitaly
Goldansky, head of the Institute of Chemical Physics, also a
colleague and friend of Khariton.
</P>
<P>
The institute was co-founded by Khariton and Nobel prize
winner Nikolai Semyonov.
</P>
<P>
Born in St.Petersburg, Khariton graduated from the Leningrad
Polytechnical Institute in 1925 and studied in the Rutherford
Cavendish Laboratory, Britain, in 1926-28. He began to work in the
Institute of Chemical Physics of the Soviet Union's Academy of
Sciences and other research centers in 1931.
</P>
<P>
He was elected a corresponding member of the Soviet Union's
Academy of Sciences in 1946 and became a full member of the
academy in 1953.
</P>
<P>
He was twice awarded the highest Soviet award of a Hero of
Socialist Labour, and won one Lenin and three State prizes of the
Soviet Union. The academy also rewarded his work with a Lomonosov
Gold medal.
</P>
<P>
Khariton, one of the Soviet (or Russian) nuclear weapon
developers, will be buried at Moscow's Necropolis, Novodevichye
cemetery, next to his wife, on December 23, sources in the
national experimental physics research institute told reporters.

<P>
HONG KONG, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese leaders value
Hong Kong's smooth transition and its long-term prosperity and
stability, said Chief Executive Designate Tung Chee Hwa here today
upon his return from Beijing, where he received the official
certificate on his appointment.
</P>
<P>
At a news briefing held at Kai Tak Airport, Tung said that the
grand and cordial reception granted to him in Beijing by top state
leaders showed the importance the country attaches to Hong Kong
and the six million local residents, to Hong Kong's smooth
transition and its long-term prosperity and stability.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing tour was brief but fruitful, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday Tung received from Premier Li Peng the order
appointing him as the first Chief Executive of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (HKSAR). He also met with President
Jiang Zemin and Vice Premier Qian Qichen on separate occasions.
</P>
<P>
The central leaders are very concerned about the stability of
Hong Kong's civil service, he said. "I myself understand this
point too, and hope that the civil service would remain steady."
</P>
<P>
Tung said he will immediately get down to work, preparing for
the formation of the first administration of HKSAR and learning of
people's livelihood.
</P>
<P>
He added that he will meet with Governor Chris Patten and Chief
Secretary Anson Chan as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
On the Provisional Legislative Council (PLC) that is to be
elected Saturday in Shenzhen, Tung called on the British side to
adopt a realistic attitude about the matter and to cooperate with
the PLC.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Russia Denies Comment on FBI Agent's Arrest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Russia's Foreign Intelligence
Service (FIS) "will not comment" on the reports about the arrest
of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agent Earl Pitts
for allegedly collaborating with Russian special services, a FIS
spokeswoman said today.
</P>
<P>
Tatyana Samolis, press secretary of FIS Director Vyacheslav
Trubnikov, told reporters that "no intelligence service in the
world ever confirms or denies the involvement of a person in its
operation."
</P>
<P>
Pitts, 43, who has worked with the FBI for 13 years, was
arrested on Wednesday on charges of spying for Russia.
</P>
<P>
U.S. judicial bodies assert that he was recruited by the KGB of
the former Soviet Union in the summer of 1987, and passed over to
Moscow classified defense-related information as well as detailed
reports on FBI staff for their possible recruitment.
</P>
<P>
From 1987 to 1992, when Pitts was reportedly "mothballed," he
received more than 200,000 U.S. dollars from Moscow, reports
reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
He was reportedly exposed during a 16-month-long operation
involving a certain Russian U.N. worker who subsequently began to
supply information to the FBI.
</P>
<P>
In response to such charges against FBI officer Pitts, the
Russian FIS chief, Trubnikov said: "Not a single state can exist
without intelligence service," adding that he sees "an underlying
political reason in this exposure."
</P>
<P>
He confirmed that over 400 career officers of foreign
intelligence services were shadowed in Russia over the past two
years.
</P>
<P>
However, Trubnikov stated, Russia will stop conducting
intelligence activities in other countries including the United
States.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Economy to Grow by 8 Percent: Mugabe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 19 (Xinhua) -- President Robert Mugabe said
today Zimbabwe's agro-based economy will this year grow by eight
percent.
</P>
<P>
In his state of the nation address to parliament, Mugabe said
the improvement in the country's economic performance has
generally been resulted from the 1995/96 good rainfall season
and high commodity prices.
</P>
<P>
He said, ''the economic upturn has stimulated renewed
confidence within the agricultural industry and the economy as a
whole. As a result, the economy is expected to register a gross
domestic product growth rate of eight percent in 1996.''
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's agricultural sector, the pillar of the country's
economy, is this year expected to grow by 49 percent, Mugabe
said.
</P>
<P>
He told parliament, ''grain crops made a significant
contribution to this growth with maize production increasing from
839,000 tons in 1994/95 season to 2,609,000 tons while wheat
production increased from 65,000 tons to 250,000 tons.''
</P>
<P>
Tobacco production also rose during the same period from
198,000 to 209,710 tons. Tobacco industry is the largest foreign
currency earner in the country. This year, zimbabwe earned 580
million U.S. dollars from its exports.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said, the manufacturing sector was expected to grow by
3.2 percent in 1996 compared to a decline of 14.2 percent in
1995.
</P>
<P>
Turning to the mining sector, he said, mining was expected to
register a decline of 1.1 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwe investment center this year approved 304 projects
worth 700 million U.S. Dollars, an increase of 79 percent from
140 million Dollars invested the previous year, he said, adding
the mining sector had accounted for 49 percent of the total
investment in the country.
</P>
<P>
The president stressed, ''in an effort to consolidate these
gains, the government took a number of steps to reduce interest
rates and inflation in order to improve the business operating
environment.''
</P>
<P>
He added, ''the government is paying urgent attention to
restoring macro-economic balance through prudent fiscal and
related monetary policies. These and other measures should create
an enabling environment for increased domestic savings and
investment, including foreign investment.''

<HEADLINE> HK Wishes to Host Next Year's ITTF Pro-Tour Finals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong has applied to
host next year's International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF)
Pro-Tour Finals, the head of the Hong Kong Table Tennis
Association (HKTTA) said here Thuresday.
</P>
<P>
An official application was delivered to the ITTF two months
ago, said HKTTA Chairman Tony Yue.
</P>
<P>
Yue said he lobbied during the 1996 Pro-Tour Finals earlier
this month in Tianjin, China, and, from what he was told at the
time, he believes that Hong Kong would most likely win the bid for
the year-end event.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong, which hosted the inaugural Women's World Cup earlier
this year, is the only bidder so far for the 1997 Pro-Tour Finals,
Yue said.
</P>
<P>
The year 1997 is of special significance because of Hong Kong's
handover to China. And the HKTTA wishes to see a perfect ending to
the year after participating in April's world championships in
Manchester, Britain, he said.
</P>
<P>
Yue said he is confident of raising enough money for staging
the event, which features the world's top 16 men and women
players.
</P>
<P>
"Various companies have already shown interest in sponsoring
table tennis events in Hong Kong," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, time might be a problem if Hong Kong is authorized to
host the tournament, as the ITTF will not decide on the venue
until the 1997 world championships. That would leave the host just
four months for preparation.
</P>
<P>
HKTTA has already started some initial work for staging the
event, Yue said. "I wish to get ourselves fully prepared in case
we win the bid," he added.

LUANDA, December 19 (Xinhua) -- A government of national

The peace accord signed in Zambia in 1994 provides that the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA)
should send its soldiers to the assembly points and hand over
all its weapons by 1996.

What we should do now is to end the formation of a unified

<HEADLINE> Recommendation to Revise US CPI Comes Under Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The recommendation by a
U.S. congressional commission for a downward revision of the U.S.
consumer price index (CPI) is encountering strong criticism from
some economists, The Washington Posts said today.
</P>
<P>
A report by a congressional advisory commission said the CPI
overstated the U.S. inflation and recommended a revision. It was
put forward two weeks ago to the U.S. Senate by the commission
headed by Michael J. Boskin of the Hoover Institute at Stanford
University.
</P>
<P>
But a number of economists have challenged some of the report's
conclusions as inaccurate.
</P>
<P>
Much of the criticism of the report is focused on the claim
that the current CPI overstates the increase in the cost of living
because it misses a significant part of the improvement in the
quality of goods and services, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Critics have also complained about the report's estimates that
the CPI overstates costs of food, housing, new and used cars,
apparel and household appliances.
</P>
<P>
The size of the overstatement "is a gross exaggeration," said
economist Barry Bosworth of the Brookings Institution.
</P>
<P>
The negative reaction from economic experts is politically
important because it will deter the U.S. government from acting on
the commission's recommendation to revise the CPI.
</P>
<P>
Revision of the CPI is a political hot potato because the index
is used to calculate payments that matter to tens of millions of
Americans for federal benefit programs, the paper said.

<HEADLINE> Egypt To Resist Pound Appreciation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Egypt has vowed to deter any
tendency for the Egyptian pound to appreciate against the
U.S. dollar in the wake of heavy capital influx in the last few
months.
</P>
<P>
"The pound is not going to go up. We don't let it appreciate,"
State Minister of the Cabinet Affairs Youssef Boutros Ghali was
quoted by today's Egyptian Gazette as saying.
</P>

The pound has been steady at about 3.39 to 3.4 pounds to the
dollar for more than two years, with the Central Bank buying
surplus dollars or selling to cover any shortages.
</P>
<P>
Bankers said the Central Bank, acting mainly through the big
four public sector retail banks, has been buying dollars for

<P>
Ghali said investments by foreigners has brought in 600 million
to 700 million dollars so far this year and direct foreign
investment leaped to about 2 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Most of the investment has been made in the second half of
the year after the government accelerated its privatization
program and the stock market started to rise, according to the
English daily.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank's foreign reserves has risen from 18.5 billion
dollars at the end of June to 18.9 billion dollars at present.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the exchange rate policy was based on
concern for Egyptian exporters, who have found it difficult to
break into foreign market.
</P>
<P>
"Our exporters are used to working in a stable exchange rate
environment. They would find it hard to handle an appreciating
pound environment," he added.
</P>
<P>
Ghali said the interest rate differential between the dollar
and Egyptian pound was no longer the dominant factor in the
pound's resilience to depreciation.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Rejects Clinton's Criticism of Israel's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu today dismissed U.S. President Bill Clinton's
criticism of his settlement policy, saying such policy would
not change.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in the weekly cabinet meeting, Netanyahu said that
his government's policy on settlements had been clear from the
very start. Contrary to Clinton's criticism, Netanyahu said that
Israel's settlement policy did not violate the Oslo accords it
signed with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
In the first warning to Israel after his reelection,
Clinton said Monday in Washington that he thought Israel's
settlement policy was preempting a final status agreement, and
was not helpful to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher also expressed his
concern that Israel's new policy to encourage settlement
expansion hinders progress in the Israeli-Palestinian peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
Despite of the U.S. criticism, Netanyahu said construction
within the existing settlements would continue. But he promised
that there would be no confiscation of land, and any
decision on building new settlements would be made only by
the full cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu rejected the notion that relations between Israel
and the U.S. had been soured by the recent developments,
especially after Israeli government's decision last week to provide
economic incentives to the settlers in order to encourage the
settlement expansion.
</P>
<P>
He said that despite of the difference of opinions over
settlement issue, Israel and the U.S. would work closely to
advance the peace process.
</P>
<P>
In sharper terms, Tourism Minister Moshe Katzav slammed the
U.S. criticism of Israel's settlement policy as a "grave
mistake," saying it only served to harden the position of
extremist Arabs.
</P>
<P>
To play down the significance of the U.S. criticism, Netanyahu
said the problem facing the government was only one of
public relations. He called on the ministers to do a better
job to explain Israel's position.
</P>
<P>
A public relations campaign has already been under way by
the Netanyahu government, which is facing increasing diplomatic
problems because of its hardline policies that have stalled
the peace process on all tracks.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister David Levy is visiting Jordan today in a
bid to ease the tension between the two countries. Meanwhile,
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai will travel to Cairo next
Tuesday to mend the increasingly tense relations with Egypt.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Strongly Condemns Hostage-Taking in Peru </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 19 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
today strongly condemned the hostage-taking in the residence of
the Japanese ambassador in the Peruvian capital of Lima by members
of the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA).
</P>
<P>
Chirac expressed his sympathy with the governments of Peru and
Japan in two messages sent to Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori
and Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, said the press
service of the presidential office.
</P>
<P>
"I don't doubt that your government will do everything
necessary to put things under control with both humaneness and
required firmness," said Chirac in his message addressed to
Fujimori.
</P>
<P>
He said that France is shocked on hearing the news and will
offer Peru its solidarity throughout this test.
</P>
<P>
In his message sent to Hashimoto, Chirac said that France
stands by the side of Japan "in this sorrowful test."
</P>
<P>
He said that Paris believes that a rapid solution will be found
to "this vile and cowardly hostage-taking."
</P>
<P>
About 15 members of the MRTA infiltrated the residence of the
Japanese ambassador Tuesday evening, taking about 500 people
hostage.
</P>
<P>
Most of the hostages have been released, while some 120
hostages, most of them Japanese and Japanese-Peruvians, are still
being held by the guerillas.
</P>
<P>
The guerillas demand the release of some 500 MRTA guerillas
jailed by the government, and abandoning of the neo-liberal
economic policy adopted by President Fujimori.

<HEADLINE> Uneasy Calm Returns to Mogadishu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Uneasy calm returned to
Somalia' capital of Mogadishu today after six days of bitter
fighting among rival factions, but local residents say fighting
may flare up again at any moment.
</P>
<P>
Pedestrians could be seen in the South Mogadishu's hot spot of
Medina for the first time in nearly a week and local residents
who had been hiding under concrete buildings from the shelling
appeared in shops to buy some food.
</P>
<P>
The reason for cease-fire is not clear, but it was believed
that militiamen loyal to Hussein Mohamed Aidid and the Peace
Alliance formed by Osman Atto and Ali Mahdi Mohamed are currently
re-organizing themselves for a showdown to gain control of some
strategic areas in South Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
The North Mogadishu faction led by Ali Mahdi also joined the
fighting by exchanging shellings with Aidid's troops in a bid to
support the initiative of the so-called Peace Alliance.
</P>
<P>
Some sources say the warring sides are running short of
ammunition that might also be attributed to the temporary
cease-fire. Others say the faction soldiers of the rival parties
are busy in planting land mines so as to gain time for stronger
militia build-up.
</P>
<P>
So far there is little information about the sources of
weapons and ammunition for the warring factions since the United
Nations had imposed arms embargo on Somalia in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The break for the fighting has enabled families trapped in the
battle zones to flee the area. But Despite the uneasy calm, the
explosions of a few mortar rounds could still be heard in the
residential areas of South Mogadishu.

<HEADLINE> Death Toll Reaches 15 in UK Food Poisoning Outbreak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Two more people have died in
the E-coli food poisoning outbreak in Lanarkshire, Scotland,
taking the death toll to 15, according to a BBC television report
today.
</P>
<P>
The Lanarkshire Health Board said that a 76-year-old man and a
78-year-old woman died Wednesday evening in Monklands District
General Hospital in the Scottish town of Airdrie.
</P>
<P>
All the 15 victims in the second worst E-coli food poisoning
outbreak ever recorded in the world have all been elderly, local
health official said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that almost 400 people had reported symptoms of
the food poisoning, which can cause kidney failure in vulnerable
people such as the elderly and young children.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman added that 178 people in the area were now
confirmed as suffering from the bug, an increase of 15 from
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to medical experts, E-coli is a bacteria normally
found in the guts of cattle, sheep and people. It is usually
harmless, but a toxic strain that lives in cattle can be passed to
human via manure or improper slaughtering.
</P>
<P>
The two Scottish butcher's shops which were linked to the
crisis reportedly have been closed.

<HEADLINE> UK Retail Sales Rise 3.9 Pct in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Retail sales volumes in Britain
rose by 0.7 percent in November after a 0.5 percent rise in
October, the biggest monthly increase since June, according to the
latest figures from the Office for National Statistics.
</P>
<P>
The rise was larger than the 0.5 percent increase most experts
were expecting and took the annual retail sale growth to 3.9
percent in November.
</P>
<P>
Sales of clothing and footwear recorded the strongest
increases, rising 2 percent last month and 7.3 percent up on the
same month last year.
</P>
<P>
Household goods continued to benefit from the recovery in the
housing market, rising about 11 percent in cash terms compared
with a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Department stores sales were also buoyant, rising 1.1 percent
in the month.
</P>
<P>
Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke welcomed the
figures, saying that consumers were "spending with confidence" but
that the rise was in line with government forecasts.
</P>
<P>
However, the continuing strength of consumer demand is likely
to fuel fears that retailers may try to rebuild their profit
margins as there was some evidence of this in the clothing and
footwear sector which saw a record price rise in September.
</P>
<P>
The retail sales figures, together with Wednesday's news of a
huge fall in unemployment, also raised economists' expectations
that base interest rates will have to rise again in the new year.

PARIS, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Zairean President Sese Seko
Mobutu will nominate a crisis government within 48 hours to deal
with the Tutsi insurgency in the eastern Kivu region, the Agence

</P>
<P>
Mobutu nominated Wednesday a new chief of the Zairean army,
General Mahel Bokoungo Lieko, after sacking last month General
Eluki Monga Aunda for failing to stop the advance of the Tutsi
Banyamulenge rebels, on a revolt since October.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of Zaire's opposition parties and government officials
held a meeting in Kinshasa today to discuss the establishment of a
crisis government, to be consisted of "people suitable for joining
a crisis government," AFP quoted those attending the meeting as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The government of Prime Minister Leon Kengo Wa Dondo has
submitted a list of names for the crisis government to President
Mobutu, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition leader Etienne Tshisekedi said that he
would not join the crisis government, expected to be headed by the
incumbent prime minister himself.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman of the presidential party Kitenge Yezu said that
Zaire needs a "strong, credible and above all representative
government whose only concern is to wash the shame which is the
occupation by the enemy armies of a part of the national
territory."
</P>

Zaire has accused Rwanda and Uganda of invading the eastern and
northeastern parts of the country to support the Banyamulenge
rebels.

<HEADLINE> US Trade Deficit Drops to 7.99 Bln Dlrs in October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. trade deficit
dropped dramatically to 7.99 billion U.S. dollars in October, the
smallest since March, according to a report from the Commerce
Department here today.
</P>
<P>
The department reported that the monthly deficit declined by
30.2 percent from the previous month's imbalance of 11.44 billion
dollars, which set the second worst showing on record.
</P>
<P>
U.S. exports increased by 4.2 percent to a record 71.74 billion
dollars while imports decreased by a slight 0.7 percent to 79.72
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.S. trade deficit with Japan in the month shot up
by 30.9 percent to 4.96 billion dollars, which was the worst
performance in 14 months, largely due to a big rise in imports of
autos and auto parts from Japan.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. deficit with China widened for a seventh consecutive
month, going up 3.5 percent to 4.9 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Much of the deficit this year has been from a surge in
America's foreign oil bill, reflecting rising prices. For October,
oil imports rose 5.1 percent to 6.27 billion dollars, the highest
level since November 1990 during the Persian Gulf crisis. The
average price per barrel of crude oil climbed to 21.38 dollars,
the highest level since January 1991.
</P>
<P>

KAMPALA, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni today stressed the importance of education, saying
education is a precondition for national development, Radio
Uganda reported.
</P>
<P>
The president said education is a precondition for natioanl
development since it is the fundamental basis for the development
of human resources.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a workshop on free primary education for four
children per family held at Makerere University here, Museveni
said that his government's concept of education is based on the
principle of education for all.
</P>
<P>
The two-day workshop, organized by the Ministry of Education,
is being attended by local officials for education and leaders of
non-governmental organizations involved in the education sector.
</P>
<P>
Museveni explained that the progra of modernizing Uganda will
be achieved through industrialization, agricultural modernization
and education for all.
</P>
<P>
He said that in order to transform the economy, the human
being must also be transformed to become a skilled worker, and
this can best be done through education.
</P>
<P>
The provision of education for all will be attained step by
step in a systematic manner,he added. He urged the people of
Uganda to work together to implement the program and be patient
so that this first step is achieved before the government takes
on larger tasks.
</P>
<P>
He cautioned, however, that by starting with four children,
the government is sending a clear signal to parents to share
responsibility for educating their children and not abandon it
entirely to the government.
</P>
<P>
Uganda will start the free education program for four children
of each family on January next year.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Defense Minister to Visit Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai is scheduled to pay a visit to Egypt next
Tuesday to accomplish a public relation mission, Israel Radio
report today.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai is expected to brief Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
on the Israeli government's efforts to advance the peace process,
hoping to ease mounting tensions between the two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Israel has recently come under increasing international
criticism for its hardline policy on the peace process in general
and the decision on settlement expansion in particular.
</P>
<P>
However, Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu today attributed the
problem to the lack of a public relation drive. Speaking at the
weekly cabinet session, Netanyahu told his ministers that they
should intensify their efforts to explain the government's policy.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai's scheduled Egypt visit is apparently part of such a
diplomatic public relation campaign.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat will travel to Cairo Friday
for talks with Mubarak on the peace talks between Palestine and
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israel claims that an agreement on partial Israeli troop
withdrawal from the West Bank city of Hebron is within reach, but
the Palestinians say that the gap between the two sides remains
wide. The Palestinian Authority has kept accusing Israel of
trying to change the peace agreements signed between Israel and
the PLO.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy today spent a day in
Jordan's capital Amman. At a press conference there, Levy said
Israel is committed to advancing peace process with the
Palestinians. He also called on Jordan to inform Syria that Israel
is interested in resuming peace talks with Damascus.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian Information Minister Marwan Muasher charged, however,
that Israel's settlement policy had jeopardized Jordan's security
and peace process.

ambitious plan to expand the use of natural gas as fuel for cars,
particularly in the governorates that have natural gas pipelines.
</P>
<P>
Speaking today at the inauguration of an oil complex at Ameria,

DAR ES SALAAM, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzania Revenue
Authority (TRA) is imposing strict monitoring of transit cargo
passing through the country to ensure compliance of transit and
tax regulations.
</P>
<P>
Among measures to be taken, according to TRA Chief Counsel,
Mushengezi Nyambele, is to install communication equipment for
monitoring movement of transit cargo.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters today, Nyambele said preparations for
the project,
</P>
<P>
which is funded by the World Bank, were at top gear and that
the control of transit cargo both inland and at exit stations
should be in place by next March.
</P>
<P>
The communication equipment will enable TRA security officials
communicate between stations set up along the relevant routes, he
addd.
</P>
<P>
Nyambele said there will also be patrol vehicles supervising
the exercise.
</P>
<P>
He said the whole thing might sound expensive but is rlatively
cheaper than the tax evasion through goods diversion which is
very rampant in the country, particularly on second hand clothes
and oil cargo.
</P>
<P>
A number of unscrupulous traders obtain rubber stamp
indicating the cargo has left the country and another stamp from
the country of destination while in real sense it is sold within

<P>
GENEVA, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The International Committee of
the Red Cross (ICRC) has been asked by the Peruvian government and
the gurrillas who have been holding hostages at the Japanese
ambassador's residence in Lima to act as a neutral intermediary in
the negotiations to resolve the crisis.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release issued today by the Geneva-based
ICRC, the head of the ICRC delegation in Peru Michel Minnig, who
was among the guests invited to attend the reception held at the
residence, has succeeded in securing the release of some 250 women
and elderly persons and about 50 men. Minnig later arranged for
medical supplies, food and water and toiletries to be brought into
the residence to improve conditions for the people inside.
</P>
<P>
ICRC has also drawn up a list of some 380 hostages and
collected messages from them to deliver to their anxious families,
ICRC said. The ICRC delegates are able to enter and leave the
residence freely to carry out their humanitarian work, it said.
</P>
<P>
ICRC has already handed over to the Peruvian authorities a
document written by members of the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary
Movement (MRTA) who sneaked into the reception and held hundreds
of guests there hostage on Wednesday. The document has also been
signed by the hostages themselves.
</P>
<P>
"At present ICRC is continuing to talk with both sides, but is
not taking an active part in the negotiations," said ICRC. It
called on the parties to undertake the firm commitment not to
resort to force or take any steps that may harm the hostages or
hamper its delegates' freedom of movement into and out of the
residence.

A crisis unit has been set up at ICRC headquarters in Geneva.
It is in constant contact with its delegation in Lima and is
closely following developments in the situation.

<P>
BELGRADE, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav Foreign Minister
Milan Milutinovic announced Thursday Serbia could hold new
municipality elections if the OSCE calls for them.
</P>
<P>
An OSCE (the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe) delegation, at the invitation of the Serbian government,
is expected to arrive in Belgrade soon to look into the partial
annulment of local election results in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference, the foreign minister said new elections
are a possibility if serious investigation proved there were
irregularities in the elections for local authorities.
</P>
<P>
But the OSCE judgement would need to be accepted by the
Serbia's institutions.
</P>
<P>
Milutinovic said OSCE observers had monitored the first round
of federal and local elections on November 3 and they gave a
positive assessment of the first round election.
</P>
<P>
Believing that the elections are quite regular, the OSCE
observers then left Yugoslavia before the second round of local
elections were held on November 17, he said.
</P>
<P>
In this context, the coming OSCE mission is expected to help
resolve controversies regarding a small part of disputed mandates
at local elections, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, tens of thousands of people continued their peaceful
march on Thursday through Belgrade in the 31st day of protests
against alleged Serbian government election fraud. The opposition
coalition Zajedno (Together) has organized all these rallies and
demonstrations, demanding the reinstatement of the annulled
election results.
</P>
<P>
Zajedno has claimed victory in 14 out of 18 biggest cities in
Serbia but the ruling Socialist Party of Serbia has conceded that
the opposition only won in Nis, a big city in southern Serbia.

<HEADLINE> Canada Opens First Non-profit Umbilical-cord Blood Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Canada has set up its first
non-profit program to store the blood from the umbilical cords of
infants to treat potential future illnesses.
</P>
<P>
Blood from the placenta of a newborn is rich in stem cells,
which are able to reproduce all the types of blood cells. Having
enough of these cells become important if the bone marrow where
blood forms must be replaced during cancer treatment.
</P>
<P>
At present, if a marrow transplant is needed, a Canadian family
must find a match from a central registry, which is possible in
only 40 percent of cases, reports said today.
</P>
<P>
The body will reject cells that are not compatible, causing
dangerous side effects. These would be no rejection using a
child's own cells.
</P>
<P>
A major advantage of cord cells from newborns is that they have
not yet been exposed to infections. Cord cells from one child
might also be used in treatment of another child in the family.
</P>
<P>
The program is to store the blood cells for only 10 years,
although theoretically there is no limit to storage.
</P>
<P>
The bank was set up by Toronto Hospital in association with
Mount Sinai Hospital and Women's College Hospital in Canada's
largest city of Toronto.
</P>
<P>
The program is voluntary and the hospital charges about 440
U.S. dollars for registration consultations, collection and
storage blood after birth. From then on, the cost of frozen
storage is 73 dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
Two commercial blood-bank programs have been set up in Canadian
provinces of British Columbia and Alberta. Both offer to store
cord blood among their services, but the cost is much higher.
</P>
<P>
Non-profit cord blood banks similar to Toronto's have been
established in New York and Paris.

<HEADLINE> OECD Predicts Three Percent Growth Rate for Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Greece will have a growth rate
of about three percent in 1997 but is in danger of maintaining an
increased public deficit, high inflation and unemployment and a
drop in competitiveness, an Athens News Agency (ANA) dispatch from
Paris said today quoting the Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development (OECD) report.
</P>
<P>
The report said the growth rate reached 2.5 percent in 1996,
which is higher than the European Union average, thanks to an
increase in public investments supported by EU funds.
</P>
<P>
However, the report notes, inflation stood at 8.5 percent,
higher than the government's convergence target, while efforts to
limit the public deficit to 7.6 percent of GDP in 1996 will be
"difficult to attain".
</P>
<P>
Consequently, the target of 4.2 percent for 1997 is in danger
of being missed, according to the OECD, which estimates that the
deficit is not expected to be reduced by more than 1.5 percent
next year.
</P>
<P>
The report also refers to "uncertainties" which exist
concerning a reduction in interest rates and the rate of
de-escalation of inflation, despite the declared intention of the
government to persist with its "hard drachma" policy.
</P>
<P>
Expansion of production "may not be enough to avert a rise in
unemployment, due to the fact that undertakings are continuing
their process of restructuring", the OECD report said.

prices in 1996, the Economic Commission for Latin America and

</P>
<P>
ECLAC estimated that average growth in the region as a whole

<HEADLINE> Multi-Party System Not for Singapore: PM Goh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's fundamental
strength is a "strong, fair and forward-looking government," Prime
Minister Goh Chok Tong said here today, challenging the idea of a
multi-party system for Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Speaking tonight to some 1,000 students at the Nanyang
Technological University (NTU) on "Singapore's Dream and
Singaporeans' Dream," Goh said Singapore would not have
accomplished half of what it did in the last 30 years if the
country "had a multi-party system and a revolving-door
government."
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that Singapore's progress would have been
affected if there were ten to 20 opposition members who always
held the government in check. Precious time and much energy would
be wasted engaging dishonest politicians in the parliament, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the prime minister's comments came
just shortly ahead of the impending general election which he is
expected to announce early next week.
</P>
<P>
"The best bed for Singaporeans to dream is the one built by
capable, honest, and committed men and women," Goh said.
</P>
<P>
He also told the students that his government would ensure them
enjoying "the fruits of meritocracy."
</P>
<P>
The prime minister also promised the young students that the
government "will give them more space to do their own things, and
encourage more street life and performances."
</P>
<P>
"We should encourage roadside portraits artists, calligraphers
and open-air performances. We should bring back exotic crafts like
snake-charmers. We can do with more spontaneity and creativity,
and more interesting night life. We will allow neon-light and
liquid-crystal advertising to brighten up selected entertainment
areas", he said.
</P>
<P>
Goh, however, also encouraged the students to "be more
independent and rely less on the government," as the 21st century
will usher in a "tougher and more competitive world."

U.S. dollars in preferential loans and 3 million dollars in
technology aid as part of its support to the country's
reorganization of its banking system.
</P>

The People's Bank and the Insurance Bank, the biggest and 4th
biggest commercial bank in Mongolia, respectively suffered a 17.4
billion-tugrik deficit (about 250 million dollars) and a 5.9
billion-tugrik one (about 85 million dollars) due to poor
management.
</P>
<P>
The government has set up two banks -- the Rejuvenation Bank
and Deposit Bank -- to take over the closed ones.

Through the "Re-employment Project" launched by the country's 22
provinces and autonomous regions, China has succeeded in keeping
its unemployment rate below three percent.
</P>
<P>
China has given top priority to the re-employment of laid-off
personnel, and encourages the countryside to digest the surplus
rural labor forces in order to alleviate pressure on urban
employment.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said that in the 1996-2000 period, China faces a
heavy employment pressure.
</P>
<P>
During that period, China will use every possible means to
create job opportunities for another eight million urban
residents, and encourage 2.5 million laid-off or redundant workers
to participate in the new jobs project.

<HEADLINE> Iran Blames Saudi Salafis for Dhahran Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Iranian authorities today
blamed Saudi opposition group known as Salafis for bombing the
U.S. military bases, which killed 19 American soldiers in
Dhahran last June.
</P>
<P>
Iran's leading hardline clergyman Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati said
that he gave a 99 percent probability that the explosion was
carried out by Salafis.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA reported that Salafis is
the opposition group that strongly opposes Saudi Arabian rule on
the bases of ideological differences and it can not stand any
more the presence of the U.S. troops in the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Addressing large number of Friday prayer worshippers at Tehran
University campus, Jannati said that "Dhahran explosion was an
internal issue in Saudi Arabia."
</P>
<P>
"Riyadh had found no document yet to support Iran's
involvement in the case," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Ayatollah cautioned the United States not to take any
"insanely course" against Iran regarding the blast.
</P>
<P>
The Friday prayer leader further pointed out that Saudi
Arabian officials are fully aware of the fact, adding that the
United States, which has some ulterior motives, wants to somehow
implicate Iran in the Dhahran bombing.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the United States is ignorant of this fact that
by threatening the Islamic Republic of Iran, it would bear no
other results than further infuriating the Iranian nation and
heightening their hatred against the U.S..

<HEADLINE> Re-employment Service Center Set up in Coastal Dalian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, December 20 (Xinhua) -- The Dalian Re-employment
Service Center, which trains displaced workers at no cost to the
individuals, opened in this coastal city in northeastern Liaoning
Province today.
</P>
<P>
According to its news briefing, the move is part of
the Dalian City government's effort to speed up enterprise reform
and relieve local state firms of their large numbers of displaced
workers.
</P>
<P>
The center aims to help the workers find new jobs within two
years. However, anyone who twice declines the work opportunities
offered by the center will be listed as jobless.
</P>
<P>
Enterprises that want their displaced workers to participate in
the training must pay 6,500 yuan per person signed up. The city
government will also provide 3,500 yuan for each trainee.
</P>
<P>
The age limit for men who want to participate in the program is
45, and for women, 40.
</P>
<P>
Once in the program, the trainees will still be regarded as
employees of their original units, and the center will pay their
wages, which will be 80 percent of the lowest amount set by the
city government, but still higher than the official bottom line of
daily income for local residents.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, state enterprises in Dalian have
dismissed over 30,000 workers, while 50,000 people have found new
positions through the city's reemployment program.
</P>
<P>
Dalian plans to lay off 100,000 employees in these state firms
in a bid to further ease their burden, according to the briefing.

<HEADLINE> Technical Upgrading Vital to Existing Enterprises: Li Peng </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng said
today that large-scale projects to upgrade and advance technology
serve as important steps to ensure the fundamental shift in the
the structure and growth mode of the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
The premier made the comment during the opening ceremony for
the transformation project of the No.1 Thermal Power Plant
affiliated with the Beijing Thermal Power Plant, which supplies
heat and electricity for the central government organizations,
foreign embassies and the eastern part of the city.
</P>
<P>
The No.1 Power Plant was listed as one of the country's 156 key
projects during the First Five-Year Plan period (1953-1957).
</P>
<P>
With the rapid economic development in the city, the demand for
heat and electricity has sharply increased, while requirements for
safe production have become more strict.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng, who formerly worked in the country's power industry,
said that it is time to upgrade the thermal power plant, as most
of the equipment there is too old to handle extended use.
</P>
<P>
He said that the finished project will greatly reduce local air
pollution, and guarantee steady and reliable electricity and heat
supplies for the capital city.

<HEADLINE> Role of Technology Stressed in Environmental Protection in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, December 20 (Xinhua) -- China will shift the focus of
its environmental protection movement from the current legal
emphasis to developing a comprehensive industry featuring new and
advanced technology.
</P>
<P>
State Councilor Song Jian made the remark during the three-day
national conference on technology for the environmental protection
system, which closed today in this north China port city.
</P>
<P>
"Good environmental protection, which is key to the achievement
of sustainable development, depends on legal measures, science and
technology, and development of the environmental protection
industry," Song said.
</P>
<P>
China has made remarkable achievements in environmental
protection through legal means, and now should stress science and
technology, he said.
</P>
<P>
To effectively deal with pollution, China's scientific and
technological research for environmental protection should mainly
control excessive pollution in major areas, and also monitor
manufacturing techniques that are environmentally-friendly, Song
said.
</P>
<P>
Research results should become practical applications, to be
carried out promptly and spread vigorously, he said, adding that
high and new technology of international advanced levels should be
adopted to tackle especially tough problems.
</P>
<P>
Song emphasized that scientific and technological development
should be guaranteed by designated funding.
</P>
<P>
"Apart from funding by the central and local governments, and
environmental protection departments, it is important to establish
a mechanism which guarantees that enterprises invest in
environmental protection under the socialist market economy," the
State Councilor observed.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that to build the environmental protection
industry, China should introduce advanced technologies from abroad
and depend on its own enterprises with a relatively strong
strength in technology.
</P>
<P>
"Many large and medium-size enterprises can play an important
part in building the industry," Song said.
</P>
<P>
He urged scientific and technological workers to play a more
active role in spreading environmental protection awareness among
the people, and improving the nation's understanding of the
subject.

<HEADLINE> Swedish Economy Mixed: OECD </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, December 20 (Xinhua)-- Economists from the
Organization for Economic Cooperation (OECD) warned that Sweden's
lofty wage costs impose a major threat to its exports and
financial market, local newspapers reported today.
</P>
<P>
The warning comes in the latest six-monthly report "Economic
Outlook."
</P>
<P>
The OECD warns that the most recent wage settlements were
higher than the Swedish economy can cope with and that future wage
agreements must be much lower, or exports will be afflicted.
</P>
<P>
Higher wage costs will lead companies to raise prices, which
will make Swedish commodities more expensive and less competitive
in international market.
</P>
<P>
Higher inflation expectations caused by the high wage costs
would also threaten the credibility Sweden has gained on the
financial market, which has provided the country with long-term
loans at low interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The report also contained positive comments on Sweden,
regarding the budget and the balance on the current account. The
state budget is heading towards a balance in 1998 and the surplus
on the current account is expected to increase from 0.3 percent of
the GDP this year to 4.5 percent in 1998. Only four out of 27 OECD
countries can beat this figure.

<HEADLINE> Sichuan Hosts Int'l Seminar on Financing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, December 20 (Xinhua) -- An international seminar on
financing opened today in Chengdu, the capital of southwest
China's Sichuan Province, which was attended by over 200 financial
experts from home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
The participants shared their experience on international
financing activities, including loans, issuing shares and bonds,
setting up funds and financing for certain projects.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Chinese enterprises in need of funds mainly rely on
bank loans and issuing shares, while other choices are limited,
according to the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan, a large inland province, now has 6,238 foreign-funded
firms, using a total foreign capital of 10.9 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Due to a shortage of funds, Sichuan needs to introduce 1.5
billion US dollar foreign investment annually, but so far this
year has actually utilized one billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Presently, only one local company issues H shares, the shares
of Chinese enterprises that are listed in Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Signs Expanded Value Added Tax Into Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel
Ramos signed into law here today a bill which amended the Value
Added Tax Law of the country.
</P>
<P>
The new law is a more equitable, broader-based and less
graft-prone taxation system that would sustain the country's
requirements for service delivery and community development, he
said.
</P>
<P>
With the approval of this vital piece of legislation, Ramos
said, the basic qualities of the value-added tax (VAT) is upheld,
the very reasons that the country shifted to the VAT system eight
years ago.
</P>
<P>
"The VAT works efficiently when it is broad-based, which was
why we had to expand the scope of the original VAT," he said.
"However, it is necessary that we ensure genuine equity in the
system."
</P>
<P>
Since its enactment and implementation in 1988, the VAT system
has provided a buoyant revenue base, he said, adding that in 1995
alone it raised some 28.8 billion pesos (1.07 billion U.S.
dollars) or 9.3 percent of the country's total revenue and is
expected to generate more than twice that amount this year.
</P>
<P>
While expanding its base, however, the new law exempts items
such as medical, dental, hospital and veterinary services not
rendered by professionals; educational services given by private
and government educational institutions; art; literary works;
musical compositions; and sale, importation and publication of
some books and magazines.
</P>
<P>
It also exempts houses and lots valued less than 1 million
pesos (38,168 dollars), coal, natural gas, petroleum products and
raw materials for their manufacture and non-agricultural, marine
and forest products.
</P>
<P>
"Putting our taxation system in order is imperative if we are
to ensure a solid government fiscal position over the long run.
Without a more rational tax policy, our country can not sustain
the gains it has reaped in recent years," the president said.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Says It Has Enough Power to Survive Winter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Spurred by a fuel shortage and
daily electricity cut-offs, the Energy and Fuel Ministry hastily
assured the public that Ukraine has enough power to survive the
winter.
</P>
<P>
About 4 million tons of coal should have been accumulated,
plus 400,000 tons of mazut and 25 billion cubic meters of gas,
said Energy and Fuel Minister Anatoly Minchenko today.
</P>
<P>
He said the volume of fuel accumulated this year equals to last
year's figures, adding the supply would be sufficient to keep the
country warm when temperatures drop.
</P>
<P>
In October, the frequency of the electricity network fell to
48.9 Hertz but has since stabilized at 49.5 Hertz. If the
frequency had continued to drop, it could have led to a collapse
of Ukraine's energy system.
</P>
<P>
Even though the frequency has stabilized, the electricity is
shut off at least two hours every day in 90 percent of Ukraine's
towns and villages.
</P>
<P>
The energy problems are further aggravated by the low profit
margin of the energy sector. "How can we operate with profit of
only 2,37 percent?" said Yury Ulitych, the deputy energy minister.
</P>
<P>
He added the rate of 3.1 cents per kilowatt hour was too low.
The ministry plans to increase the price to 3.6 cents.
</P>
<P>
Additionally, unpaid electricity bills nationwide will total
1.5 million U.S. dollars by the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
Minchenko said the ministry expects the parliament to ratify
the agreement between Ukraine and the World Bank on a loan of 120
million dollars to buy fuel for thermal power plants.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Ukraine will need about 80 billion cubic meters of
gas, the energy minister said. Ukraine has already agreed to
import 53 billion cubic meters of gas from Russia and 6 billion
cubic meters from Uzbekistan to supplement the country's reserve
of 17 billion cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
He said Ukraine was negotiating an agreement with Turkmenistan
for at least 7 billion cubic meters of gas. So far, Ukraine has
owed Russia gas debts of 564 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Yemen Achieves Great Success in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANAA, December 20 (Xinhua) -- The economic, financial and
administrative reform program in Yemen, started in March 1995,
has achieved great successes, actually beyond expectation in
minimizing state budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
The reform program had cut the deficit from 19.147 billion
Yemeni rials (about 152 million U.S. dollars) to 7.122 billion
rials (56.5 million dollars) during the first nine months of the
current year.
</P>
<P>
The program has also scored tangible success in stabilizing
the rate of exchange of the national currency against foreign
currencies, particularly the U.S. dollar. It has also stemmed the
growing inflation.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to control the cash flow, the Yemeni central bank
absorbed more than 8 billion Yemeni rials (63 million dollars) by
issuing Treasury bonds, besides the liberalization of trade,
abolition of import licenses, and encouraging exports. Exports
over the past year amounted to 108 million dollars, as compared
with 40.3 million dollars in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Likewise, steps have been taken to embark on the initial phase
of the free zone in Aden at a total cost of 500 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
In the field of administrative reform and stamping out
corruption and manipulation of public funds, the program has
activated the machinery of control and auditing, and more than
2,000 cases have been referred to public fund courts.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, Yemeni successes in the implementation of
the economic, financial and administrative reform program have
given rise to a state of content and optimism, not only in Yemen
and among the Yemeni people, but also at the level on
international and regional organizations and countries.
</P>
<P>
They highly appreciate the steps and achievements made by
Yemen, so much so that international organizations have decided
to augment their assistance and support for Yemen, and soft loans
to Yemen over the current year have reached 350 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the World Bank has decided to increase its annual
finance to Yemen to 140 million dollars, and the Paris Club has
agreed to drop 67 per cent of the due Yemeni debts. Besides,
positive initiatives have been made by Holland, Japan, France and
Germany to augment their assistance and support to Yemen.
</P>
<P>
Yemen's successes have also prompted local, Arab and foreign
investors to flock to Yemen where the total number of projects
approved by the Yemeni Investment Authority has exceeded 900 with
a total investment cost of more than 211 billion rials (1.67
billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Several foreign companies have actually applied to invest in
the free zone of southern Yemeni city of Aden. The value of
these requests has exceeded 1.5 billion dollars, providing job
opportunities to some 10,000 Yemenis.
</P>
<P>
However, economists here believe that despite these
achievements and successes, it cannot be said that everything has
been straightened out or that Yemen has flourished.
</P>
<P>
Yemen is still a poor, developing country. The economic crisis
is there, and the economic struggle has not been decided one way
or the other. It is incumbent upon Yemen, therefore, to pursue
its efforts, and to mobilize all potentials as well as financial
and human resources for the success of the overall economic and
social development, in order to emerge from the vicious circle of
poverty, and to build a prosperous and economically strong
country.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Opposition Warns Against Expulsion of MPs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of Nepal's main
opposition and a former ruling partner today warned against
possible expulsion of two MPs from the lower house.
</P>
<P>
President of the main opposition Communist Party Of Nepal
(United Marxist Leninist, CPN-UML) Man Mohan Adhikari and
parliamentary leader of the National Democratic Party (RPP)
Lokendra Bahadur Chand told a press conference today that their
parties will not accept the house speaker's possible decision to
expel two MPs of a third party.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued on the occasion said that the RPP has
withdrawn their support to the present coalition government.
</P>
<P>
A delegation of leaders of the CPN-UML and the RPP met Speaker
Ram Chandra Poudel and Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba, both
from the main ruling Nepali Congress (NC) party, earlier today to
warn against possible dismissal of two Nepal Goodwill Party (NSP)
MPs from the house, the two leaders said.
</P>
<P>
Expulsion of any MPs from the house is unconstitutional at a
time when a special house session has been convened to discuss a
no-confidence motion against the government, they told the press
conference.
</P>
<P>
The NSP party, meanwhile, registered separate letters at the
parliament on Wednesday and Thursday, asking for immediate
expulsion of it's MPs Anish Ansari and Hridyesh Tripathi as they
supported the no-confidence motion filed by the CPN-UML and the
RPP.
</P>
<P>
The two MPs are among the 102 lawmakers who requested King
Birendra to summon the special house session by claiming that they
had lost confidence in the Deuba government.
</P>
<P>
A no-confidence motion requires a majority vote of 103 to pass
in the 205-seat lower house of Nepal.
</P>
<P>
The present coalition government was formed in September last
year by the NC, the RPP and the NSP after they jointly overthrew
the minority CPN-UML government through a similar censure motion.
</P>
<P>
The RPP party, with only 19 MPs in the house, will lead a new
ruling coalition if the present NC-led government is ousted
through the motion.

</P>
<P>
The region has maintained 14 to 20 percent in annual economic
growth rates. More than 30 percent of China's foreign investment
has flocked to the region.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has now established trade contacts with more than 160
countries and regions. More than 4,000 overseas enterprises or
institutions have established representative offices, 150 of which
are financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
Over 18,000 foreign-funded enterprises have landed in the

investment.
</P>
<P>
With Zhejiang's Beilun Port and Zhoushan Port, in the south of
Shanghai, and Zhangjiagang Port and Nantong Port to the north of
Shanghai, the five closely connected ports can handle 10 million
TEU in containers, forming the bulk of a modern international
shipping center.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai Port alone handles one quarter of China's sea cargo
and one third of sea containers. It has started regular cargo
routes to different parts of the world. Some 2,700 domestic and
foreign transportation agencies have opened offices in Shanghai,
and more than 200 institutions are providing services for
them. The world's top ten international shipping companies have

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 20 (Xinhua) -- France will suspend imports of
cattle and beef from Switzerland as a precautionary measure
against BSE, or mad cow disease, said French officials today.
</P>
<P>
Switzerland, the second most Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy
(BSE)-touched country after Britain, registered 240 cases of such
disease since its first appearance 10 years ago. Britain recorded
160,000 BSE cases in the same period.
</P>
<P>
Since January, 45 cases of BSE, whose virus are believed to be
capable of causing a slowly developing but fatal human disease,
occurred in Switzerland, which has culled hundreds of thousands of
cows.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture Minister Philippe Vasseur will make an official
announcement of the decision today.
</P>
<P>
The French government will have to wait for an official
decision by the European Union before applying its decision, said
the officials.
</P>
<P>
Germany, Italy and Austria have already banned imports of Swiss
cattle and beefs.
</P>
<P>
France has begun banning living cattle from Switzerland, and
putting strict sanitary controls over entry of beef products from

SHANGHAI, December 20 (Xinhua) -- China is busy turning its
major port and largest industrial city into an international
shipping center by increasing its handling capacity to 220 million
tons by the end of the century and 280 million tons by the year
2010.
</P>

If all goes as planned, experts say, the port, which has been
plagued by a serious sludge problem for half a century, will be a
flourishing international water transport center, Xu Bozhang, an
official in charge of construction of the international shipping
center, says.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the potential international shipping center, Cao
Lansheng, a shipping expert and director of the Planning and
Development Commission of the China Port Association, says that
Shanghai has advantages similar to those of Rotterdam, Hong Kong,
Singapore, and New York, but that the most important thing is how
the port and channel construction go.
</P>
<P>
Referring to other advantages of Shanghai, he said that the
city is a flourishing financial and trade center, and handles 52
billion US dollars worth of goods annually. And, with a 14 to 20
percent annual growth rate in the Yangtze River Delta, and in the
entire Yangtze River valley, the volume of container freight at
the port is growing by 30 percent annually.

<HEADLINE> Military Factories Urged to Make Environmental Protection Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, December 20 (Xinhua) -- A leading Chinese official has
called on the country's military industry to switch to production
of environmental protection equipment.
</P>
<P>
With 450 billion yuan due to be spent by China on environmental
protection over the next five years, State Councillor Song Jiang
said that military industry enterprises can play an important role
by launching into the so-called 'sunshine industries'.
</P>
<P>
Song, also minister of State Science and Technology Commission
and chairman of the State Council's Environmental Protection
Committee, made the remark today at an ongoing national
conference on environmental science and technology.
</P>
<P>
He said military industry enterprises have technological and
manufacturing superiority. However, they are short of production
orders and are capable of making other products, not related to
military or defense items.
</P>
<P>
The environmental protection industry has seen rapid growth in
the world, and has been what he called a "sunrise industry."
</P>
<P>
The state councillor said China has entered a period of large
scale environmental protection prevention and treatment, and the
environmental protection industry needs greater development.
</P>
<P>
The country has decided to put 450 billion yuan (59.9 billion
U.S. dollars) into environmental protection by the end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
China now has some 9,000 factories specializing in
environmental protection facilities and products, but most have
out-of-date techniques and products.
</P>
<P>
Song stressed that advanced technology, both domestic and
overseas, must be introduced into the industry, especially into
the large and medium-sized factories to upgrade China's
environmental protection industry and improve quality of products.
</P>
<P>
Song Jiang also asked the nation's environmental protection
departments to strengthen the administration of the environmental
protection products' market and institute a fair competition
system.

<HEADLINE> Supreme Court Stays Judgment on President's Rule </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 20 (Xinhua) -- The Indian Supreme Court
today stayed a judgment passed by Uttar Pradesh's Allahabad High
Court on Thursday to quash presidential rule in the state.
</P>
<P>
The Indian government filed a petition challenging the high
court judgment in the wake of an order issued by the latter and
the supreme court.
</P>
<P>
In granting an interim stay on the high court order, a
three-judge bench said, "This will not preclude the governor of
Uttar Pradesh from exploring the possibility of forming a popular
government."
</P>
<P>
From the end of October to early November this year, assembly
elections were held in Uttar Pradesh, but no single political
party won a clear majority in the polls. The Bharatiya Janata
Party (BJP) emerged the largest party in the state, but it could
not muster enough support to form a government.
</P>
<P>
To avoid chaos and violence in the state, the central
government decided to re-impose the president's rule there as it
had done before the assembly elections. The parliament approved
the action of the central government, but the BJP challenged the
move in the Allahabad High Court.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Maintains Strong Growth Momentum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 20 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine economy, which
began to pick up three years ago, further gained strength in the
first three quarters in 1996, the National Economic and
Development (NEDA) said today.
</P>
<P>
In a review on economic performance in 1996, the NEDA cited an
impressive increase in the country's gross national product (GNP),
a considerable fall in its inflation rate and improving financial
situation for the government.
</P>
<P>
The GNP, adjusted for inflation, grew by 7.1 during the first
three quarters this year, compared to 5.3 percent a year ago, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The report said the recovery of agriculture and the continued
good performance of the services and industry sectors raised gross
domestic product (GDP) by 5.4 percent from last year's 4.9
percent.
</P>
<P>
Though merchandise trade suffered from a weak demand for
electronics and garments and traditional exports like coconut
products, the hefty growth of non-merchandise exports led to an
23.1 percent expansion in total exports.
</P>
<P>
In another sign of strong economic showing, inflation rate fell
rapidly to single-digit levels in June from more than 10 percent
last year. The inflation rate experienced a record low of 4.4
percent in September and increasing slightly to 4.5 percent by
November.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government will enjoy a financial surplus for
the third consecutive year. As of October 1996, the government's
financial surplus has reached 10.7 billion pesos, 300 million
pesos higher than the amount recorded last year.
</P>
<P>
With inflation in check, combined with sustained improvement in
the government financial operations and stable peso-dollar
exchange rate, the country's interest rates have been on the
downtrend for most of the year.
</P>
<P>
The country's employment situation is also encouraging. The
report said the continued strong economic performance has been
encouraging people to look for jobs.
</P>
<P>
Citing a survey conducted by the NEDA in July, the report said
unemployment rate dropped substantially to 7.7 percent that month
from 8.8 percent a year earlier.

<HEADLINE> China to Step up Legislation for Asset Evaluation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 20 (Xinhua) -- China will step up legislation
for the asset evaluation industry in an effort to promote the
healthy development of this sector, the State Administration of
State Property (SASP) announced today.
</P>
<P>
Asset appraising is a new undertaking in China, covering both
what can be seen and what can't, such as fixed assets, land-use
rights, trade marks and industrial property rights, said
Pan Yue, deputy director of the SASP.
</P>
<P>
"All departments must safeguard state interests and stick to
the principle of evaluating assets in accordance with unified
policies and standards, in order to ease the financial burden of
enterprises and optimize the distribution of available assets,"
Pan said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China had 2,893 asset evaluation agencies
employing more than 48,000 professional asset appraisers by the
end of last year.
</P>
<P>
Assets evaluated during the Eighth Five-Year Plan period
(1991-1995) had an account value of over 1.43 trillion yuan (about
173.4 billion US dollars), over 710 billion yuan more than the
number at which they were appraised.
</P>
<P>
However, the excessive participation in asset evaluation by
different departments has wrought chaos in the sector and
increased the financial burden of enterprises, Pan pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"This has ultimately harmed the effort to deepen enterprise
reforms and tarnished China's image in opening up to the rest of
the world," he said, adding that it has also corrupted people's
work habits.
</P>
<P>
"The negative trend must be halted," he noted.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Economic Slowdown, of Cyclical Nature </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Even tourism was not spared. The number of visitors fell by 4.8
percent, the first decline since the first quarter of 1991. As a
result, retail sales were flat, while restaurants and hotels
registered lower takings during the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
However, in analyzing the economic situation, both the
Singapore government and economists in the private sector agreed
that what the economy was experiencing was more of a short sharp
shock, which was considered a welcome breather, than any prolonged
slump.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said late last month that the
government was not worried about the current slowdown, because the
country's economic fundamentals were "very strong" and the
downturn in the electronics industry, being cyclical, was expected
to take an upturn next year.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong commented that unlike the
economic recession in 1985, currently, the investment commitments
in Singapore remained strong.
</P>
<P>
The Economic Development Board (EDB) had attracted a total of
6.4 billion Singapore dollars (about 4.6 billion US dollars) of
investment in the first nine months, and by the end of this year,
the figure was expected to exceed the originally target of 7.5
billion Singapore dollars (about 5.36 billion US dollars) to set a
new record of 8 billion Singapore dollars (about 5.7 billion US
dollars), he said.
</P>
<P>
Overall, the deputy prime minister said that Singapore's
domestic economic fundamentals remained sound, while externally,
there were positive signs that the current slowdown would not be
too severe or prolonged.
</P>
<P>
Given such assessment of the present economic situation at
home, the government said that there would be no need to make "any
drastic policy adjustments to cope with the downturn." Rather, it
wanted to maintain "an even course, and accept slower growth for a
few quarters until external demand picks up again."
</P>
<P>
In dealing with the structural changes taking place in some
sectors of the economy, the Singapore government pledged to
continue its efforts in helping companies to upgrade their
operations, re-train workers, and improve their performance to
remain competitive.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the government said the current slowdown had
not changed its longer term assessment that Asia is set to boom
for the next 20 years, that Singapore is well placed to take
advantage of this regional prosperity, and that Singapore's
economy can aim to grow by six to eight percent per year over the
next decade.
</P>
<P>
As for the outlook of next year, the Ministry of Trade and
Industry is expecting the economy to grow by five to seven percent
in 1997, assuming that the electronics industry picks up
world-wide by the latter half of the year.

<HEADLINE> Regulation on Annual Enterprise Check Issued </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Limited corporations,
joint-stock companies, and other enterprises and businesses with
service licences in China will have to undergo annual checks from
the new year.
</P>
<P>
Companies disobeying rules and firms failing to attend the
checks, to be conducted between January to April, face measures
that could prevent them expanding and lead to their licences being
cancelled.
</P>
<P>
The announcement has been made in the Regulation on Annual
Enterprise Assessment, issued by China's State Administration for
Industry and Commerce, and will take effect from January 1st next
year.
</P>
<P>
According to the regulation, after the check, enterprises will
be divided into two categories. A-category enterprises will be those
which have a sound performance in adhering to rules and regulations
of the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, and
enterprises that disobey the rules will belong to B-category.
</P>
<P>
B-category enterprises are forbidden to open branches, set up
limited or joint-stock companies, or expand their business in
other ways.
</P>
<P>
The regulation also says that enterprises that do not attend
the check will be banned from any further business, and their
names will be made public. If the enterprises still do not apply
for the check within 30 days, their licences will be revoked.
</P>
<P>
The rule is an effort to strengthen the supervision of
industrial and commercial administration organs on markets and
regulate annual assessments for enterprises, according to
authorities with the State Administration for Industry and
Commerce.

<HEADLINE> Singapore's Trade Declines in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's total trade
declined by 1.4 percent in November, when the country saw a sharp
fall of 8.8 percent in its non-oil domestic exports, the Singapore
Trade Development Board (TDB) announced today.
</P>
<P>
It said, however, that on a three-month moving average basis,
total trade at current prices in the month increased marginally by
0.4 percent, while non-oil domestic exports decreased by 4.7
percent, affected by a cyclical downturn in global electronics
demand.
</P>
<P>
Oil domestic exports continued to rise by 23.6 percent as oil
prices remained high and re-exports went up marginally by 1
percent. But on a monthly basis, re-exports shrank by 4.1 percent
and domestic exports of oil jumped by 29.2 percent in November.
</P>
<P>
This was due mainly to the continued surge of 25 percent in oil
prices as demand soared because of cold weather in Europe and the
United States, the TDB said.
</P>
<P>
Non-oil domestic exports, after falling by 4.7 percent, were
valued at 7.3 billion Singapore dollars (about 5.21 billion U.S.
dollars). The decline was reflected in key markets such as the
United States, the European Union, Malaysia, Japan and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, non-oil domestic exports to South Korea and
China remained strong, growing by 11.6 percent and 39.9 percent
respectively, it said.
</P>
<P>
The value of oil domestic exports stood at 1.5 billion
Singapore dollars (about 1.07 billion U.S. dollars) in November,
while that of re-exports was 6.1 billion Singapore dollars (about
4.36 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
In November, imports increased marginally by 1 percent to 15.9
billion Singapore dollars (about 11.36 billion U.S. dollars). The
increase was largely in imports of computer parts and peripherals,
disk drives, motorized vessels, blank computer tapes and discs and
other products, the TDB said.

SHENZHEN, December 20 (Xinhua) -- A high-tech company in
Shenzhen City, a special economic zone in south China's Guangdong
Province, has set up China's first production line for recordable
laser compact discs.
</P>
<P>
The Shenzhen Xianke Digital Laser Disc Company has invested 5.1
million US dollars to produce the new kind of information storage
medium.
</P>
<P>
People can only usually retrieve information from CDs used in
computers and video recorders, but can not store data on them.
</P>

industry.
</P>
<P>
Recordable CDs are in great demand on world markets, according
to Wang Shijie, general manager of the company. His company, he
added, is able to produce 1.5 million such discs a year, 70
percent of them for export.
</P>
<P>
In this way, the company is able to rake in a net profit of two
million US dollars a year.

<HEADLINE> Australia Retains Import Ban on Uncooked Salmon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Australia will retain an
import ban on uncooked salmon products, federal Primary Industries
Minister John Anderson said today.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here he said that he had advised the
United States and Canada of the decision taken by the Australian
Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS). Both of them have sought
to export uncooked salmon products to Australia.
</P>
<P>
"I fully support the AQIS decision, which is based on
scientific and technical grounds and which is entirely consistent
with Australia's rights under the Sanitary and Phytosanitary
Agreement of the World Trade Organization," he said.
</P>
<P>
The AQIS finalized its decision after an extensive scientific
study of some 24 diseases of salmon, most of which do not exist in
Australia.
</P>
<P>
The AQIS said that an agreement to allow the entry of uncooked
salmon products presented risks substantially greater than would
agreement to many other access requests.
</P>
<P>
It also would be almost impossible to eradicate the diseases if
they became established in Australian waterways, and the diseases
could harm the population of endangered and vulnerable native
salmon species.

<HEADLINE> Yearender: Faster Growth Expected for HK Economy in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's economy would
grow faster in 1997 than this year following the good performance
over the past few months, economic analysts here say.
</P>
<P>
The upward trend of Hong Kong's economy is evident this
year. In the first quarter, the gross domestic product (GDP) only
registered a 3.3 percent rise, but in the second quarter the rise
went up to 4.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
For the third and fourth quarters, the GDP is expected to rise
by 5.3 percent and 6.2 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
This rising momentum will continue, many analysts believe. In
their recent economic forecasts, Hong Kong Bank projected a 5.2
percent rise in real GDP for 1997, while Hang Seng Bank estimated
the growth to be 5.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Other local major financial and economic institutes and many
individual analysts generally hold that the growth would be around
5.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The forecast growth rate is much higher than the latest
readjusted official forecast of 4.7 percent for the whole of this
year.
</P>
<P>
Consumption is expected to be a major factor for boosting the
economy in 1997. The local stock and property markets' positive
outlook will help stimulate consumer spending, and tourist income
will also enjoy considerable increases riding on the historical
moment of Hong Kong's return to the motherland in the year.
</P>
<P>
George Leung, economic adviser with Hong Kong Bank, said: "The
rise in domestic consumption since the middle of this year looks
set to continue into 1997, supported by the positive wealth effect
generated by the prosperous local stock and property markets."
</P>
<P>
The unemployment rate has been falling steadily this year,
dropping to a low of 2.6 percent in the third quarter. With a
rebound in economic activities, employment opportunities would
continue to grow, which would boost economic confidence and
increase real incomes.
</P>
<P>
Many analysts also hold that the interest rate environment is
likely to remain as steady in 1997, which is very important to the
upward trend of economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Although Hong Kong's external trade grew only about five
percent for the first nine months of this year, it is expected to
have a considerable improvement in 1997 because of such favorable
factors as expected recovery in global demand and stronger import
 demand from China's inland areas.
</P>
<P>
The exports of services would benefit directly from the rebound
in external trade. The expected influx of tourists in the coming
year would further boost service exports including the hotel
sector.
</P>
<P>
In the first 10 months of this year, visitor arrivals rose by
15.9 percent, and the growth is expected to exceed 20 percent
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Inflation in 1997 is expected between 6.8 percent to 7.0
percent, slightly higher than this year's estimated 6.0 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Chavalit
Yongchaiyudh has urged the state-run media to promote the
country's political reform and national development, a local
newspaper said today.
</P>
<P>
Chavalit said that all branches of the state-run media,
including those under the military, will be fully utilized for
this goal, according to the "Bangkok Post".
</P>
<P>
Well-known academics and celebrities could educate the public
about political reform through panel discussions arranged on radio
and television, while other groups would also be allowed to use
the state media to voice their opinions, he said.
</P>
<P>
The state-run media will be made to present news in a
straightforward and accurate manner with the aim to educate people
and promote sound morals, the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
The state media can criticize the government's performance but
must adhere to the right principles in their reporting, for
instance, they should not rely solely on quotes from unnamed
sources when reporting on a controversial issue, he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, other reports said that Chavalit earlier had
instructed related government agencies to strengthen their
information collection work to keep the government well-informed
on domestic and international situations.

<HEADLINE> Peru Tentatively Decides to Reject Rebel Demands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, December 20 (Xinhua) -- The Peruvian government has
tentatively decided to reject rebel demands to free their jailed
comrades in exchange for the release of some 400 hostages, a
Peruvian radio station reported today.
</P>
<P>
Radioprogramas del Peru said that after a Cabinet meeting last
night, the government tentatively decided to "approve a proposal
of the president of the republic to not accept the appeal to free
any terrorist imprisoned in a Peruvian penitentiary."
</P>
<P>
The radio station said its report was based on a fax from a
government official, but its authenticity had not been approved.
</P>
<P>
Leftist guerrillas broke into the residence of Japanese
Ambassador Morihisa Aoki Tuesday night and took hostage all the
people in the compound celebrating Japanese Emperor Akihito's
birthday.
</P>
<P>
The guerrillas with the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement,
armed with guns and grenades, threatened Wednesday to kill the
hostages one by one if the government didn't release their
imprisoned comrades. But the rebels let their noon deadline pass
without killing any hostages. They did not publicly reiterate the
threat Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Red Cross workers delivered drinking water, fruit, food,
medicine and clothes to the 375 men still held in the Japanese
ambassador's residence. All women have been released.
</P>
<P>
The remaining hostages are from at least 28 countries.
</P>
<P>
The United States asked Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori not
to give in to rebels' demands, but Japan cautioned him on any
action that could threaten the lives of the hostages.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Foreign Minister Yukihito Ikeda was in Lima to help
solve the problem and the Washington also sent security agents.
</P>
<P>
It was still unclear how the rebels, only about 20 in number,
were able to break into the residence and round up so many people.
</P>
<P>
Vincent said he heard an explosion and then the rebels rushed
in, shooting in the air and yelling.
</P>

The MRTA guerrillas are the second largest anti-government
group in the country, after the Shining Path.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Tens of thousands of bamboo
and wooden slips dating back 1,700 years have been unearthed in
a downtown area of Changsha, capital of central China's Hunan
Province.
</P>
<P>
Chinese archaeologists say that the slips, bearing at least
200,000 words, are the largest number of their kind ever found in
the country, and will contribute greatly to the study of the Three
Kingdoms Period (220-280).
</P>
<P>
The slips, found stored in a pit, are detailed records of the
political, economic, military, cultural and geographic situation
of Changsha prefecture, which was under the rule of the Wu State
(222-280).
</P>
<P>
The records cover taxes, renting, registration, legal system,
administration positions, rites, and storage.
</P>
<P>
Yu Weichao, curator of the prestigious National Museum of
Chinese History, says that find is as important as the discoveries
of the world-renowned oracle bones and shells from the Shang
Dynasty (16-11th Century BC) in central China's Henan Province and
the Dunhuang documents in the Mogao Grottos in northwest China's

<HEADLINE> Arafat Heads Home After Talks With Mubarak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
left for home following brief talks with Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak this morning on the stagnant negotiations with Israel on
the Hebron issue.
</P>
<P>
Arafat briefed Mubarak on the outcome of his recent tour of
Europe, which took him to Austria, Albania, Italy and the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has just wound up his four-leg European tour which
started last Tuesday in a bid to scoop up support to the
Palestinians when negotiations with the Israelis are virtually
frozen at the present time.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's current visit to Cairo fell within constant
consultations between the two leaders on the Mideast peace
process, the Egyptian Middle East News Agency reported, giving no
more details about the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival at dawn today, Arafat said that the Israeli
government has failed so far to implement any of the pending 34
articles in the Palestinian-Israeli Oslo II Agreement.
</P>
<P>
He specified some of the stumbling blocks as Israeli troop
redeployment in Hebron, the policy of sealing off areas to Arab
access, siege, confiscation of occupied lands, building
settlements and arrests.
</P>
<P>
Arafat showed his doubt that these problems would be solved
soon.
</P>
<P>
"There is no glimpse of hope for reaching in the future a
solution acceptable to the Palestinian party and realizing peace
in the region, in the light of such intransigence by the Israeli
government," he said.
</P>
<P>
Israel and the Palestinian Authority are expected to hold
talks to settle the sensitive issues such as the final status of
Palestinian territories including Jerusalem, Palestinian refugees
and border demarcation. The final status talks should be wrapped
up by May 1999 under the Oslo accords.
</P>
<P>
After two months of negotiations in vain, the two sides
renewed talks last Monday on Hebron, the last of the seven West
Bank towns from which Israel troops are supposed to redeploy
under the Oslo accords, but the talks were bogged down over
security arrangement for 400 Jews living among 100,000 Arabs in
the city.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the recent Israeli decision to grant financial
benefits to Jewish settlers in the occupied Arab lands to promote
settlement expansion has raised the ire of Palestinians, who said
the practice violated peace agreements and preempted final status
talks.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, the first Arab country to sign peace treaty with the
Jewish state, has rejected the settlement policy as "illegal and
unacceptable" and blamed Israel for the "negative situation."
</P>
<P>
"Everybody is pessimistic about the future of the peace
process. This is not merely a French, Egyptian, Arab or European
impression, but an international impression," said Egyptian
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa during his two-day visit to Paris
ending Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Summing up the stand of Egypt and the Arab world, Moussa said
"we won't accept peace with Israeli conditions."

<HEADLINE> Philippines Sees Continued Economic Boom in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 20 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine economy will
continue to boom next year, with a sustained high growth of the
gross national product (GNP) and a remarkable drop in the
inflation rate, the National Economic and Development Authority
(NEDA) said today.
</P>
<P>
With short-term stabilization measures on track and most
structural adjustment measures firmed up, the GNP growth will
reach 7 to 8 percent in real terms in 1997, NEDA Director-General
Clelito Habito told reporters at an economic forum.
</P>
<P>
The projected GNP growth rate is a little higher than the 1996
target of 6.5 to 7.5 percent. During the first three quarters of
this year, the country registered a 7.1-percent GNP growth.
</P>
<P>
Habito, who is also socioeconomic planning secretary, said the
real GNP growth is expected to range between 7.1 and 7.8 percent,
a slight increase from the expected target of 6 to 6.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, inflation is expected to slow down significantly to
about 6.5 percent from the expected 8.5 percent this year. This
projection is closer to the norm of 4 to 5 percent among other
members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
</P>
<P>
Following the downward trend in inflation, the average domestic
interest rates are expected to also move downward in 1997, Habito
said.
</P>
<P>
The country's import liberalization as well as the tariff
reform program are both expected to support the competitiveness of
Philippine industries.
</P>
<P>
Barring adverse weather conditions, agriculture is expected to
perform better in 1997 given the government's additional budgetary
infusions for the construction of irrigation facilities and
post-harvest equipment.
</P>
<P>
On the fiscal side, the consolidated public sector financial
position, for the first time in two decades, is estimated to
balance in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Merchandise exports are projected to grow by 23.8 percent,
Habito said, adding that this growth will be supported by the
continued recovery of the Japanese, West European and U.S.
economies.
</P>
<P>
The attainment of the growth objectives in 1997 will hinge on
the achievement of stable prices, increased competitiveness of
Philippine products, structural adjustments, improved
infrastructure and continued political stability, Habito stressed.
</P>
<P>
To ensure sustained economic development in the medium term, he
added, the government needs to implement sound macroeconomic
policies for economic stability and long-run policies for
industrial restructuring and poverty alleviation and human
development.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Pest Management Program Gains Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's integrated pest
management (IPM) program gained much success with the area of rice
crops using the method increasing to more than one million
hectares, the ministry of agriculture and rural development said.
</P>
<P>
Millions of farmers in the northern and southern deltas as well
as in the highland areas have been taught the IPM knowledge, the
ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The IPM is an inter-state program launched by the UN Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO) in the 1980s, aimed at increasing
the output of rice crops and protecting the environment by helping
rice-growing countries in South and Southeast Asia raise the
effectiveness of pest control and curb the use of insecticide.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam joined the IPM program in early 1990 when the program
entered its second phase.
</P>
<P>
The IPM program is significant to Vietnam where more than 80
percent of the population subsists on agriculture and more than
six million hectares are earmarked for rice crops every
year.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Economic Slowdown, of Cyclical Nature </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Although the year 1996 has
seen the economic growth of Singapore slowing down from 11.4
percent in the first quarter to 3.2 percent in the third quarter,
the Singapore Government and economists here believe the slowdown
is only of cyclical nature and the economy is expected to pick up
by the middle of 1997.
</P>
<P>
After enjoying 14 straight quarters of over seven percent
growth, the Singapore economy suddenly started to slow down from
the second quarter this year. In just nine months, the quarterly
economic growth fell from 11.4 percent in the first three months
of the year to 3.2 percent in the third quarter, marking the
lowest quarterly growth level in the past ten years since the
economic recession in the middle of the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
The government was therefore forced to revise its economic
growth forecast for the whole year downwards from the initial
7.5-8.5 percent to 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Economists here attributed the slowdown to an unfortunate
confluence of several negative forces, with the biggest being the
global cyclical electronics slump, while a sluggish stock market,
a policy-induced property cooling-down, and the structural
weaknesses in several sectors at home also contributing to the
overall slowdown.
</P>
<P>
The electronics industry, like in the whole region, has been
the driving force behind Singapore's robust growth in recent
years. It accounts for, by some estimates, around 70 percent of
Singapore's non-oil domestic exports, 44 percent of manufacturing
value-added, and 14 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
Therefore, unsurprisingly, a global electronics inventory
overhang that surfaced late last year showed up in Singapore some
six months later in June, resulting in the first dip in exports in
four years. Exports then continued to contract in August and
September, leading to the industrial output decline in the third
quarter.
</P>
<P>
The 4.3 percent contraction in the industry, its worst
performance in a decade, also had its unfortunate impact felt in a
number of other sectors. For one, the global electronics downturn
had also hit regional economies such as Malaysia and Thailand. And
this, in turn, had led to knock-on effects on Singapore's major
services like shipping and entrepot trade.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts pointed out that it was not electronics alone
that led to Singapore's less-than-sparkling economic performance.
The marine industry, for example, continued to be affected by
weakness in the global industry, and the petroleum products and
petrochemicals industries were hit by both maintenance shutdowns
and keen competition.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the electrical appliances industry continued to be
affected by relocation and weaker demand, while growth in the
financial services sub-sector, pulled down by a lackluster bourse,
reported a mere 3.3 percent growth, the lowest in seven quarters.

<HEADLINE> Impounded Reptiles to Be Released in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 20 (Xinhua) -- More than 700 exotic lizards
and snakes are to be set free in Zimbabwe's bushes.
</P>
<P>
The exotic lizards and snakes, worth 100,000 US Dollars, were
impounded by Pretoria authorities last month under the Animals
Protection Act while being smuggled from Mozambique to the United
States, where there is a lucrative market for them.
</P>
<P>
The reptiles automatically became South African property and a
decision was taken by the Pretoria government to have some of them
set free in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Arrangements for the exercise have been made by the local
department of national parks and wildlife management and the
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA).
</P>
<P>
Inspector Neil Fraser of the South African SPCA told the Zimbabwe
National News Agency in Harare on Thursday a total of 23 puff adders
and 609 lizards were to be set free in northeastern zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
He said some of the reptiles had to be released in Zimbabwe
because it had a sound wildlife conservation policy similar to South
Africa's. enditem

<HEADLINE> West, Central Africa Records Higher Maize </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 20 (Xinhua) -- There has been a phenomenal increase
in maize production in west and central Africa in recent years, the
International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) based in
Ibadan, Nigeria, said in its 1995 annual report.
</P>
<P>
The newly released report said the average annual growth rate
of maize production in the region for the 1983-92 is 4.1 percent,
whereas the percentage for east and southern Africa in the same
period is only 0.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
It said that Burkina Faso, Ghana, Guinea and Mali recorded
extremely high annual growth rates and the land area devoted to
maize production has increased at an average rate of 2.7 percent
a year in the period.
</P>
<P>
The report attributes the growth in production to the introduction
of high-yielding, drought-tolerant, early and extra-early maturity
varieities.
</P>
<P>
The new varieties have a yield potential of five tonnes per
hectare, and are ready for harvest as green maize in 60 days, or as
dry grains in 75 to 80 days, compared with 120 days for older
varieties, the report said. enditem

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Refuses Israel's Proposal of Arab </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese President Elias
Hrawi has rejected an Israeli proposal to deploy Arab
peacekeeping forces in south Lebanon, and accused Israel of
igniting border violence to scare away foreign investments
pledged in Washington earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
The president's remarks came as tensions escalated in south
Lebanon amid repeated Israeli air strikes at suspected guerrilla
targets on hills opposite the Israeli self-styled "security
zone" in the area.
</P>
<P>
"The Israeli proposal for the deployment of Jordanian and
Egyptian forces in the south is an attempt to drive a wedge
between Lebanon and Syria," Hrawi was quoted by today's Daily
Star, Beirut's only English daily, as saying
</P>
<P>
The head of state made the speech to a number of parliament
members who visited him at the Beirut Presidential Palace
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Israeli Public Security Minister Avigdor
Kahalani suggested that a multinational peacekeeping force that
includes Egyptian and Jordanian contingents be deployed in the
occupied border enclave in south Lebanon after Israel's troop
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Israel established the 1,100-square-kilometer "security zone"
in south Lebanon in 1985 as a buffer to guard against
cross-boarder guerrilla attacks on its northern Jewish
settlements.
</P>
<P>
Both Egypt and Jordan are bound to the Jewish state by peace
treaties, and Kahalani's exclusion of Damascus was perceived
here as an attempt to undercut Syria's role, the newspaper
noted.
</P>
<P>
Hrawi said should Israel agree to withdraw from the so-called
"security zone," the Lebanese army and Lebanese security forces
"are fully capable of maintaining peace and protecting the
border. We do not need to bring in Arab forces."
</P>
<P>
He said Israel was trying to undermine the success achieved
at the Friends of Lebanon conference, which was held in
Washington last Monday, by fueling tension in south Lebanon to
scare international investors.
</P>
<P>
During the Washington conference, 29 countries and eight
international financial institutions promised to provide 3.2
billion U.S. dollars in aid to help Lebanon execute its ambitious
reconstruction plans in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
"The forum in Washington considerably bolstered the morale of
the Lebanese," Hrawi said, "Israel is trying to undermine the
psychological and material gains we received at the conference."
</P>
<P>
He said the only way to counter Israeli schemes against
Lebanon was for the participants in the Washington forum to
expedite the grants and loans quickly.

PARIS, December 20 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The Italian comedian Marcello Mastroianni died of cancer
Thursday morning in Paris at the age of 72. Mastroianni, to be
buried in Italy, starred in such milestone movies as "We Loved
Each Other So Much," "La Dolce Vita," "Eight and a Half," and "The
City of Women."
</P>
<P>
-- Some 23 members of the Peruvian guerrilla group Tupac Amaru
Revolutionary Movement were still holding about 500 hostages at the
residence of the Japanese ambassador in Lima. Difficult
negotiations was going on between the guerrillas and the Peruvian
government, while the International Red Cross was sending food and
other daily necessities to the hostages.
</P>
<P>
-- France has abandoned its hope of obtaining the seat of the
Naples-based NATO South Command after NATO defense ministers held
talks in Brussels on November 17-18. However, Paris is insisting
on take-over of the seat by a European general. A British admiral
is the most possible candidate for the seat.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The morale of French employers is a little bit higher at the
end of 1996 than one year ago, shows an annual poll by Le Figaro.
About 30 percent of the bosses in France are optimistic about
1997, against last year's 27 percent; and 42 percent of them
expect a revenue growth of zero to one percent next year, while 60
percent expect to maintain their present number of employees next
year.
</P>
<P>
-- The case around the discovery last week in a Paris shopping
center of a bag containing a gas bottle and nails -- the
ingredients for the bomb used in the attack on a Paris train early
this month -- turned into a thriller story Thursday morning. One
of the key witnesses, a shop-keeper, was abducted for several
hours before being released by the kidnappers, who wanted to know
what he had told the police. The shop-keeper reportedly saw three
North Africans placing the gas bottle in the shopping center
before running away.

<HEADLINE> S. African Air Force to Upgrade Transport Planes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Johannesburg, December 20 (Xinhua) -- The South Africn Air Force
(SAAF) will spend 500 million Rand (about 108 million U.S. dollars) to
upgrade its 33-year-old fleet of 12 Lockheed C-130 transport aircraft,
the local newspaper the Star reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
This is the largest order placed by the SAAF since international
military sanctions agatinst South Africa were lifted in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The five-year program will be carried out in Britain and South
Africa, Acting Chief of the SAAF Bertus Burger was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Of all the 12 C-130 transport aircraft, five were newly
presented as gifts by the United States on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing at a ceremony at which the United States Air Force
handed over the gifts of the first two of five C-130s to the SAAF,
Berger said "by world standards, upgrading aircraft which have had
33-years of service is fairly late, but to pay 500 million Rand for
such an upgrade program is much less expensive than the cost of
purchasing new aircraft."
</P>
<P>
The upgrade plan, he said, would be undertaken as part of a joint
venture between Britan's Marshall company and Denel Aviaton, a
subsidiary of the Denel Group. Three of the planes are to be upgraded
in Brtain and the remainder in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Charge'd Affaires Bob Pringle, who also attended the aircraft
handover ceremony, said that his country's gift to the SAAF
symbolized the American desire for strong links with South Africa. He
said "through this kind of cooperation, the U.S. and South Africa are
working together to improve the SAAF's ability to respond to the needs
of South Africa as well as the southern African region."
</P>
<P>
The remianing three C-130s transport planes are due to reach
Waterkloof Air Force base before mid 1997, the report said. enditem

<HEADLINE> Arafat Pessimistic About Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
today expressed his disappointment about the pace of the stalled
peace talks due to Israel's hardline policy, saying that a quick
solution to all differences would be impossible.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian National Authority president arrived here at
dawn today for talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said upon arrival that the Israeli government has failed
so far to implement any of the pending 34 articles in the
Palestinian-Israeli Oslo II Agreement.
</P>
<P>
He specified some of the stumbling blocks as Israeli troops
redeployment in Hebron, the policy of sealing off areas to Arab
access, siege, confiscation of occupied lands, building
settlements and arrests.
</P>
<P>
Arafat showed his doubt that these problems would be solved
soon.
</P>
<P>
"There is no glimpse of hope for reaching in the future a
solution acceptable to the Palestinian party and realizing peace
in the region, in the light of such intransigence by the Israeli
government," he said.
</P>
<P>
After two months of negotiations in vain, the two sides renewed
talks last Monday on Hebron, the last of the seven West Bank towns
from which Israel troops are supposed to redeploy under the Oslo
accords, but the talks were bogged down over security arrangement
for 400 Jews living among 100,000 Arabs in the city.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the recent Israeli decision to grant financial
benefits to Jewish settlers in the occupied Arab lands to promote
settlement expansion has raised the ire of Palestinians, who said
the practice violated peace agreements and preempted final status
talks.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, the first Arab country to sign peace treaty with the
Jewish state, has rejected the settlement policy as "illegal and
unacceptable" and blamed the "negative situation" on Israel.
</P>
<P>
"Everybody is pessimistic about the future of the peace
process. This is not merely a French, Egyptian, Arab or European
impresson, but an international impression," said Egyptian Foreign
Minister Amr during his visit to Paris Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Upon arrival, Arafat said that he will brief Mubarak on the
outcome of his recent tour of Europe, which took him to Austria,
Albania, Italy and the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
He said he will seek the Egyptian president's advice especially
when negotiations with the Israelis are virtually frozen at the
present time.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has just winded up his four-leg European tour which
started last Tuesday in a bid to drum up stronger support to the
Palestinians and the Mideast peace process.

<HEADLINE> Israel May Accept a Limited Palestinian State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 20 (Xinhua) -- In a sign of rare
flexibility, a senior Israeli official indicated today that
Israel may accept a Palestinian state with strictly defined and
limited sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
David Bar-Illan, media adviser to Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu, said in an interview with The Jerusalem Post that this
was because the partition between the two sides already existed
and the notion of "Greater Israel" was no longer possible.
</P>
<P>
"I think partition is a fact. The question now is really what
sort of partition," said Bar-Illan, who is often described as the
leading ideological aide to Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
He said that a Palestinian state already existed to some
extent. "In many ways, it is a state ... In many ways, it is much
more of a state than it was envisioned in the Oslo agreement," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Bar-Illan said the Likud government would insist on limiting
its sovereignty, such as demanding its demilitarization.
</P>
<P>
He said there was no great difference today between the Likud
and Labor, due to Likud's adherence to Oslo accords. But he
criticized the previous Labor government for no forcing Arafat to
stick to limits which, if unchecked, would lead to a militarized
Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
"I think when the Labor Party talked about the state, they
said that they wanted it to be demilitarized; but if it isn't,
well there is nothing much we can do about it," he said.
</P>
<P>
"While Netanyahu is making it a condition for the existence of
an entity, whether you call it a state or not is not really the
important thing. The condition is that it cannot have unlimited
sovereignty," he continued.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that if the Palestinians declared statehood at
some point in the future, he believed that "the whole world will
recognize it."
</P>
<P>
Talking about Netanyahu's ideology, Bar-Illan said, " I think
in general he is no longer (in favor of ) a whole-land-of Israel
movement. I don't think he feels that there is any chance of the
land of Israel remaining completely under the exclusive rule of
Israel."
</P>
<P>
On the issue of settlement expansion, Bar-Illan repeated the
government declaration that while construction within existing
settlements would continue, no "another square inch" would be
added to any settlement.
</P>
<P>
He asked the Palestinians not to worry that Israel was seeking
to preclude the negotiations on the final disposition of the
territories, a criticism made even by U.S. President Bill Clinton
early this week.
</P>
<P>
Israel and the Palestinian Authority (PA) are expected to hold
final-status talks to settle the sensitive issues such as the
final status of Palestinian territories including Jerusalem,
Palestinian refugees and border demarcation.
</P>
<P>
The PA is demanding the establishment of an independent state
with eastern Jerusalem as its capital, but Israel's Likud
government has declared its opposition to such a state. The issue
has to be resolved in the final-status talks, which should be
wrapped up by May 1999 under the Oslo accords.

<HEADLINE> HKSAR Provisional Legislators to Be Elected Saturday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 20 (Xinhua) -- The Provisional Legislative
Council (PLC) of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(HKSAR) will be elected by the Selection Committee for the First
Government of the HKSAR at its fourth plenary session in Shenzhen,
southern China, Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The 60 provisional legislators will be chosen from among the
130 candidates by the 400 members of the Selection Committee at
the session to be presided over by the chairman and vice-chairmen
of the Preparatory Committee for the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
The PLC in fact is the product of the British side's unilateral
act to push through the "Constitutional Package" which destroyed
the "through train" for Hong Kong's existing Legislative Council
as agreed upon by the Chinese and British governments.
</P>
<P>
To avoid the legal vacuum in the transition period and to
ensure effective functioning of the HKSAR, the Preparatory
Committee made a decision to establish the PLC at its second
session held in Beijing in March this year in line with the Basic
Law and related decisions of China's National People's Congress
(NPC).
</P>
<P>
The Preparatory Committee also laid down the tasks for the PLC
and decided that the operation of the PLC cannot be extended
beyond June 30, 1998.
</P>
<P>
On October 6, the Sixth Plenary Session of the Preparatory
Committee approved the methods for the formation of the PLC of
HKSAR, which stipulated that the Selection Committee will elect
the members of the PLC through secret ballot.
</P>
<P>
From November 18 to December 9, the nomination of applicants
for the PLC members were conducted in Hong Kong. A total of 134
application forms had been completed by the deadline.
</P>
<P>
Applicants came from various sectors in Hong Kong, including
accountants, lawyers, bankers, teachers, doctors, artists,
entrepreneurs, businessmen and labor representatives.
</P>
<P>
The Seventh Plenary Session of the Preparatory Committee held
in Shenzhen on December 12 confirmed 130 candidates for the PLC,
including 34 members of the current Hong Kong Legislature.
</P>
<P>
In the past week, the candidates held a series of activities,
writing articles in newspapers and meeting with communities, to
convey their political visions.
</P>
<P>
Nearly all candidates expressed their readiness to contribute
to Hong Kong's smooth transition and play an active role in
legislation to ensure Hong Kong's long-term prosperity and
stability.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that some 200 reporters from Hong Kong and
overseas will cover the fourth session of the Selection Committee
in Shenzhen Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The venue was originally planned at Hong Kong, but the British
side's refusal to cooperate forced the meeting to move to
Shenzhen.

<HEADLINE> Fierce Fighting Rages in Southwestern Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Heavy fighting raged yesterday
between Ugandan government army and the rebels of the Allied
Democratic Force (ADF) in the Rwenzori mountains, southwestern
Uganda.
</P>
<P>
According to the local daily ''the New Vision'' today, an
estimated 2,000 government soldiers pursued the rebels believed
to be over 800, who attacked villages in the mountainous area.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the number of the casualties on both sides was not
known due to a new order barring field commanders from talking to
the press.
</P>
<P>
The fighting sparked off a fresh displacement of thousands of
people, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
At least 3,000 civilians were said to be on the move from
the mountain area to the lower area.
</P>
<P>
After Zairean troops lost Beni, Kasindi and other towns in the
eastern Zaire, the ADF rebels broke off and entered into Uganda,
the paper said. enditem

<HEADLINE> Israel Pressures Egypt for Releasing Spy Suspect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu said Thursday night that he is pressing Egypt
to free Azzam Azzam, who was arrested in Cairo a month ago on spy
charges, reported Israel Radio today.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu received Azzam's family members in his office and
told them that he is confident that Azzam, a 36-year-old Israeli
Druse, will be set free by the Egyptian authorities very soon.
</P>
<P>
Azzam, a mechanic for a joint Israeli-Egyptian textile mill
in Cairo, was arrested on November 6. He will stand trial in
Cairo on charges of spying for Israel.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian police have charged that Azzam had helped recruit
Imad Ismail, an Egyptian citizen, as a spy, and gave him
T-shirts soaked in invisible ink to use in writing reports to
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Ismail, who is also in custody, has reportedly confessed to
the charges. Egyptian media reports say Azzam initially confessed
to the charges but now maintains his innocence.
</P>
<P>
According to a report from Cairo, Egypt may also try two
Israeli-Arab women in absentia for leading a spy ring. Hisham
Seraya, the state security prosecutor, said the two women, Zahra
Yousel Jreis and Mona Ahmed Shawahna, are suspected of having
worked with Azzam Azzam to recruit Ismail to spy for Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israeli government officials have denied the spy ring
charges.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Agriculture Develops Fast in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Agriculture in Uganda has been
recovering and developing fast in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture is the most important sector in Uganda's economy.
Agricultural output value accounts for 51 percent of its gross
domestic product and 95 percent of its export earning. Now,
Uganda is one of the nine African countries self-sufficient in
grain.
</P>
<P>
Coffee growing as the pillar of the country's national economy
has in recent years recovered and developed very rapidly. Its
production has increased steadily from 92,000 tons in 1992 to
180,000 tons this year. Uganda ranks second after Cote d'Ivoire
in Africa in coffee production.
</P>
<P>
The value of coffee exports of Uganda accounts for 75 percent
of the country's total export income.
</P>
<P>
The recovery and development of coffee production in Uganda
are attributed to the steps taken by the government. These
include cancelling monopoly of coffee exports by the Coffee
Marketing Board, encouraging private companies to export coffee
and privatising coffee nurseries to speed up the replacement of
low-yielding coffee trees.
</P>
<P>
Cotton was Uganda's main export after coffee in the 1950s and
1960s. But cotton production plummeted in the 1970s and early
1980s, because of political turmoil and civil war. The country's
cotton production fell to almost zero in 1985.
</P>
<P>
Since 1985, the country's cotton production increased
gradually, to 27,000 bales in 1989 and further to 60,000 bales in
1993. In the 1995/96 season, the country is expected to export
69,000 bales, 1.28 times that of the previous season.
</P>
<P>
The above situation is attributed to measures taken by the
government. It has considered the revival of cotton production as
a strategy for poverty reduction in the country, because cotton
growing is a major income earning activity for many Ugandan
peasants, particularly in the poverty-stricken northeast of the
country.
</P>
<P>
One of the major measures for the increase of cotton
production is the introduction of a prolific cotton variety,
which yields twice as much as that of traditional varieties.
</P>
<P>
Another measure is to abolish the Cotton Marketing Board's
monopoly over cotton export and the monopoly by the cooperative
unions over ginning. As a result, production enthusiasm of cotton
farmers has been increased.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: HK Provisional Legislative Council </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 20 (Xinhua) -- The establishment of the
Provisional Legislative Council (PLC) of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR) is necessary for Hong Kong's smooth
transition and for HKSAR's effective operation.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese side has declared time and again that the setting
up of the council is a measure the Chinese side has to adopt after
the British side unilaterally carried out its "constitutional
package".
</P>
<P>
The "constitutional package", which contravened the
Sino-British Joint Declaration on the Question of Hong Kong, the
principle of convergence with the Basic Law of the HKSAR and the
agreements and understandings reached between the Chinese and
British sides, has destroyed the "through train".
</P>
<P>
The "through train" mainly means that members of Hong Kong's
last Legislative Council may become, upon confirmation by the
HKSAR Preparatory Committee, members of the first Legislative
Council the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
From April to November 1993, the representatives of the Chinese
and British governments held 17 rounds of talks on the
arrangements for the 1994-95 elections in Hong Kong, which are to
produce the three-tier political structure: the Legislative
Council, urban and regional councils and district boards.
</P>
<P>
However, before the representatives could reach agreement for
the 1994-95 elections in Hong Kong, the British side unilaterally
discontinued the talks at the 17th round and submitted to the Hong
Kong Legislative Council part of the questions under discussion
between the two sides, which directly led to the termination of
the talks.
</P>
<P>
Obviously, it was the British side's disruption that scuttled
the talks for the 1994-95 electoral arrangements, which, in turn,
destroyed the "through train" for Hong Kong's three-tier political
structure.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government and the Standing Committee of China's
National People's Congress (NPC) have made it clear that the Hong
Kong Legislative Council, district boards and urban and regional
councils elected under Chris Patten's political reform deal will
stop functioning in mid-1997 when China resumes the exercise of
its sovereignty over Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The political structure of the HKSAR after July 1, 1997 will be
built in accordance with the relevant decisions of the NPC and the
provisions of the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
Now that the "through train" has been destroyed due to the
British side's unilateral act, it is impossible for the first
Legislative Council of the HKSAR to be formed at the time when the
HKSAR is established.
</P>
<P>
In that case, a lot of legal work stipulated by the Basic Law
and the NPC decisions for the HKSAR Legislative Council to handle
will be either delayed or suspended, such as the law on the
application for HKSAR passports and visa issuing, the law on HKSAR
flag and emblem, as well as the appointment of the judges of the
Court of Final Appeal and the Chief Judge of the High Court.
</P>
<P>
To avoid the legal vacuum after July 1, 1997, a provisional
legislative council is imperative to enact necessary laws and
ordinances for the future HKSAR in the later stage of the
transition period.
</P>
<P>
At its second session in Beijing on March 24, 1996, the
Preparatory Committee for the HKSAR of the NPC made a decision on
setting up the HKSAR Provisional Legislative Council (PLC).
</P>
<P>
According to the decision, the PLC is to be elected by the
Selection Committee for the First Government of the HKSAR and it
is to be formed and to start work after the HKSAR Chief Executive
is chosen.
</P>
<P>
The PLC will consist of 60 members, with the majority being
permanent Hong Kong residents with Chinese citizenship. Permanent
Hong Kong residents without Chinese citizenship or with right of
abode in foreign countries will account for no more than 20
percent of the PLC members.
</P>
<P>
At the seventh session of the Preparatory Committee held in
Shenzhen on December 12, 130 candidates for the PLC were confirmed
out of the 134 applicants.
</P>
<P>
The election of the PLC members are scheduled at the fourth
plenary session of the Selection Committee for the First
Government of the HKSAR on December 21.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Agriculture Develops Fast in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Tea was Uganda's fourth
foreign exchange earner after coffee, cotton and tourism in the
late 1960s and 1970s. At present, it has become the third, after
coffee and tourism.
</P>
<P>
In 1972, Uganda's tea output reached 23 million kilograms.
However, in August that year, all ethnic Asians who controlled
over 70 percent of the industry in the country were expelled by
the Amin administration. The tea plantations were then so badly
managed that only less than 10 percent of the estates had been
under cultivation by 1986, when the tea output dropped to only
one million kilograms.
</P>
<P>
Since 1987, the government has taken measures to recover the
industry. These are to return tea estates to Asians, abolish
state monopoly of tea export and privatize four tea factories in
the country.
</P>
<P>
Due to the measures, tea output in the country had increased
from 1.5 million kilos in 1981 to close 12.7 million kilos in
1995. In the same period, tea exports increased from 0.5 million
kilos to some 10.7 million kilos. It is estimated that by the end
of this century, tea industry in Uganda, the world's 10th largest
tea producer, will be fully recovered.
</P>
<P>
At present, tobacco is the fourth most important export crop
in Uganda after coffee, tea and cotton. The country's tobacco
industry has made a tremendous progress in recent years too.
Tobacco leaf production had increased from 1,963 tons in 1984 to
6,638 tons in l995.
</P>
<P>
The progrss is attributed to the formation of a multi-national
company in 1984 with the British American Tobacco owning 70
percent of the shares and the Ugandan government 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
The company, which holds the monopoly of the industry, has
injected a large amount of fund into the leaf-growing areas to
rehabilitate the infrastructure and farms destroyed during the
civil war in the 1970s and early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
In order to reduce dependence of the country's economy on
coffee exportation, an export diversification program has been
carried out in the country. Vanilla production is the best sector
in carrying out the program. According to statistics from the
Finance Ministry, the output of vanilla green beans had increased
from 5,400 kilos in 1990 to 37,866 kilos in 1993, while export
value of the crop from 43,250 US Dollars to 437,366 Dollars in
the same period.
</P>
<P>
Grain production in the country has also been recovering and
developing fast in recent years. Output of banana, one of the
major staple food for Ugandans, had increased from 7.76 million
tons in 1988 to 8.5 million tons in 1995. Uganda now is the
largest banana producer in the world.
</P>
<P>
The output of sweet potatoes had increased from 1.65 million
tons in 1989 to 1.8 million tons in 1995, ranking the country
first in Africa and fourth in the world.
</P>
<P>
The grain production situation is due to national
reconciliation and economic reform policies carried out by the
governmnent in the past 11 years. It is these policies that most
peaceful and stable political situation has appeared in the most
parts of the country since 1986.

<HEADLINE> Demand for Zambian Cut Flowers Rises in Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Demand for Zambian cut flowers has
risen in Britain and orders are beyong Zambia's capacity, Zambia
Daily Mail reported today.
</P>
<P>
The local newspaper quoted the export review published by the
Export Board of Zambia (EBZ) and the Zambia Export Growers
Association (ZEGA) as saying a total of 41 inquiries were received
during the international flower trade exposition (IFTEX) held in
London recently and the demand is likely to outstrip the supply
capacity of the Zambian exporters.
</P>
<P>
The orders once confirmed will keep the Zambian exporters in
active business for the next two years, according the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
A research made by the EBZ early this year indicated that
Zambia has the capacity to expand its export of cut flowers,
fruits and vegetables by selling directly to the consumers and not
only through the auction system. enditem

<HEADLINE> Candidates for Provisional Legislature Vow to Do Good </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Most of the 130 candidates
for the 60-member Provisional Legislative Council (PLC) of the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) have made public
their ideas and visions in newspapers or meetings over the past
week.
</P>
<P>
They explained why they run for the PLC and spoke of the
priorities in legislation, but they all pledged to do good to Hong
Kong once they are elected.
</P>
<P>
Former legislator Tam Wai-chu said that she decided to run for
the PLC because she wanted to continue to pave the way for Hong
Kong's handover. "I want to work together with the 6.3 million
Hong Kong people to implement the principle of 'One country, Two
systems'."
</P>
<P>
Surveyor Leung Chun-ying, who is also a vice chairman of the
Preparatory Committee for the First Government of the HKSAR, said
that the establishment of the PLC is another important stage for
the establishment of the HKSAR government, and it is also a
significant measure to ensure that the HKSAR government can
operate effectively and legally.
</P>
<P>
He said that there is one simple and important purpose for him
to participate in the election, that is, to carry out the tasks
laid down by the Preparatory Committee.
</P>
<P>
Lawyer Wong Ying-ho said if he is elected, he will suggest the
PLC give priority to laws that will promote economic development
and people's livelihood. As for public expenditure, he hopes a
balanced budget will be drafted to protect the interests of
different levels and make good use of limited resources.
</P>
<P>
Incumbent legislator Ip Kwok-him said, being locally born and
bred, he should make his part of contribution to Hong Kong at this
historical turning point. He hoped to join the PLC and serve the
HKSAR government with his legislative experience.
</P>
<P>
An overwhelming majority of the candidates have explained their
ideas to members of the Selection Committee who are to choose the
60 provisional legislators through secret balloting Saturday in
Shenzhen, southern China.
</P>
<P>
They have also explained to the public what they will do if
they are elected. Some of them stress issues such as education,
culture, economic development and environment protection, and some
give priority to women's rights, social welfare, housing, medical
and health work.
</P>
<P>
The candidates come from a wide spectrum of society,
representing people at different levels and in different sectors.

<HEADLINE> More Private Investors in Shanghai Property Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 20 (Xinhua) -- The proportion of private
investment on Shanghai's real estate market is gradually
increasing, "China Land News" has reported.
</P>
<P>
Contrary to the decrease of developers in the property market
in other parts of China, property development enterprises in
Shanghai rose from 2,400 in September of 1995 to 3,000 in this
September. Among the newly opened enterprises, most have received
their investments from private individuals.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing-based newspaper attributed the pouring of private
capital into the property market to a number of reasons.
</P>
<P>
-- Shanghai municipal government's implementation this year of
a series of policies to enliven the secondary real estate market,
with the policies already proving effective.
</P>
<P>
-- Control of the amount of land supply in the city has been
effective.
</P>
<P>
-- Housing sales volumes in the real estate market continue to
rise, with more and more houses sold.
</P>
<P>
-- Property development remaining attractive, but with funding
for such development tight due to governmental control.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that increase of private capital has diversified
the channels of investment in the real estate sector. It has given
an encouraging sign that the property market has become warmer,
and has also reflected investors' confidence in the market.

<HEADLINE> Earnings from Overseas Tourism to Top 10 Billion U.S. Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Overseas tourists will have
poured a record 10 billion US dollars into China during 1996,
tourism officials have reported.
</P>
<P>
The officials describe the growing tourism levels as an
exciting time for China.
</P>
<P>
The information was disclosed today by Sun Gang, deputy
director of the China National Tourism Administration, who is
especially in Shanghai to attend the '96 Domestic Tourism Fair.
</P>
<P>
China is also reported to have received more domestic tourists
during 1996, contributing 160 billion yuan (one U.S. dollars
equals to about 8.3 Chinese yuan) to the country's earnings from
tourism services.
</P>
<P>
Last year China received 46.4 million overseas tourists, and
earned 8.7 billion U.S. dollars from tourist related services, both
showing marked increases compared with corresponding figures of
1990.
</P>
<P>
Between 1991 and 1995, the country received 203 million overseas
tourists and earned 27.5 billion U.S. dollars from tourism.
</P>
<P>
Participants at the fair attributed the success in tourism
sector to China's policy which encourages various organizations at
different levels to develop tourism industries vigorously if
conditions allow, and to the improve basic facilities across the
country.
</P>
<P>
China has built 1,400 scenic spots each capable of receiving
hundreds of overseas tourists annually, and has more than 3,000
hotels authorized to receive overseas tourists, providing 450,000
guest rooms.
</P>
<P>
The China National Tourism Administration has been working hard
to adjust the structure of tourism programs, including the
establishment of 12 state-level tourism and holiday zones, in
addition to efforts made to continue to improve tourism services
both for domestic and overseas tourists.

<HEADLINE> Retired Brig, Four Others Summoned in Espionage Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 20 (Xinhua) -- A Delhi court has summoned a
retired brigadier, a former union government adviser in the
Department of Electronics and three others for their alleged role
in a nine-year-old espionage case, local newspapers reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The case involves smuggling of the country's top secret radar
and helicopter technology to France and the Netherlands, the
newspapers said.
</P>
<P>
Acting upon a complaint by the Central Bureau of Investigation
(CBI), Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Prem Kumar on Thursday
ordered the five to appear in court on January 30 next year to
stand trial for offenses "prejudicial to the country's security
and integrity."
</P>
<P>
Among the accused are retired Brigadier Rajpal Singh, former
union government adviser Narayan Waman Nerurkar and owner of a
chain of private firms in Delhi Krishna Kumar Jajodia.
</P>
<P>
The espionage bid fell through after a courier company official
found the documents Jajodia gave him to be secret defense papers
and reported to his bosses who then lodged a complaint with the
CBI.
</P>
<P>
The documents included an 86-page photocopy of a report on
surveillance radar and a 13-page typed draft letter addressed to
the Defense Ministry dealing with the subjects like tactical
control radar systems.
</P>
<P>
The CBI had also seized a note on utility helicopters for the
army from Jajodia's home in south Delhi.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Political Orientation Should Be Closely Watched </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, December 20 (Xinhua) -- As Japan sought to play a larger
role in the international community in 1996, its domestic politics
continued its drift to the right, prompting fears among
neighboring Asian nations of a revival of the Japanese militarism.
</P>
<P>
The year 1996 saw Tokyo whipping up public sentiment for a
re-drawing of the Japan-U.S. security pact, a move aimed at
expanding the scope and remit of Japan's defense forces, to
include joint operations in any regional crises.
</P>
<P>
Along with strengthening the Japanese-U.S. alliance, Japan has
in recent years continually increased military expenditure and
tried to promote its political influence by sending troops abroad.
</P>
<P>
In its annual white paper on defense, Tokyo wantonly plays up
the "China threat" theory, calling for a guard against
defense-oriented military moves by China.
</P>
<P>
On July 29, Ryutaro Hashimoto became the first prime minister
since 1985 to pay homage to the notorious Tokyo-based Yasukuni
Shrine housing tablets of 14 class-A war criminals, including
wartime prime minister Hideki Tojo.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto, accompanied by seven cabinet members, visited the
shrine in an official capacity, undermining the significance of a
statement by then Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama on August 15,
1995, to mark the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, Murayama expressed remorse over Japan's
aggression and colonial rule of other Asian states before and
during the war and resolved not to repeat the "mistake".
</P>
<P>
The shrine has generated fear abroad and parochial nationalism
and patriotism at home. For it is really a political institution
rather than a religious shrine.
</P>
<P>
Although some politicians in Japan acknowledge the country's
past atrocities which brought great suffering to neighboring Asian
countries, the political community in Japan overall has done no
soul-searching over the country's aggression during the first half
of the century.
</P>
<P>
Some leading politicians have attempted to whitewash Japan's
wartime atrocities by covering up historical facts, leading most
Japanese young people to the sole knowledge of the atomic bombing
of their own country and giving them none or a very shallow
knowledge of the disaster Japan inflicted on China and other Asian
countries.
</P>
<P>
These politicians even demanded China "correct" its textbooks
on the Nanjing Massacre, also known as the Rape of Nanking, in
which more than 300,000 innocent Chinese were killed by Japanese
invaders in December 1937.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) issued a
15-point platform before the October general election, which
included support for the LDP ministers' visit to the Yasukuni
Shrine and for territorial claims over China's Diaoyu islands in
the East China Sea.

<HEADLINE> Political Stability Vital to Developing Nations: Chinese Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Developing countries will find
it impossible to boost their economies or raise people's living
standard without a stable political environment, Chinese Premier
Li Peng said today.
</P>
<P>
Li made the statement in Beijing during a meeting with visiting
Togolese Minister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation Koffi Panou.
</P>
<P>
Expressing satisfaction over the sustained, healthy development
of Sino-Togo ties, the premier said there has been a good momentum
in bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
He made special mention of President Eyadema's fourth
successful visit to China last year, saying it had ushered
bilateral ties to a new level.
</P>
<P>
Li praised the Togolese government and people for the
remarkable achievements made in safeguarding national political
stability and restoring the economy. The moves had been made in
order to pursue a political system and path for development
suiting Togo's own national situation, Li said, adding that China
respects the choice made by the Togolese people.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Li also spoke highly of the Togolese
government's "one China" stand, forging no official ties of any
kind with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Panou said China has achieved great success in domestic
construction and in its performance on the international stage.
According to Panou, China has always stood abreast with developing
countries and is a reliable friend of developing nations.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister praised the good relations between Togo
and China, saying that his nation values its cooperation with
China.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Political Orientation Should Be Closely Watched </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The LDP's Research Commission on Foreign Affairs and Foreign
Affairs Division went even farther in November, proposing that
foreign heads of state and key statesmen be urged to pay homage to
the shrine. This, once again, seriously offends the feelings of
Asian peoples, who suffered appalling atrocities at the hands of
the Japanese.
</P>
<P>
Some LDP legislators, led by former cabinet minister Seisuke
Okuno, even deny the fact that Japan forced an estimated 200,000
women, mostly Koreans, into sexual slavery for Japanese soldiers
during the war of aggression, despite the Japanese government's
apology over the oft-stated "comfort women" issue.
</P>
<P>
Only in Japan can the absurd arguments and strange theories
that embellish the history of aggression run so rife and the
shameless reversal of the verdict on the war cry out so loudly.
</P>
<P>
The political shift to the right was also evident in the
acquiescence of the Japanese government to a Japanese state flag
being hoisted and a lighthouse being built by a Japanese
right-wing group on China's Diaoyu Island in July.
</P>
<P>
The Diaoyu islands, an inalienable part of Chinese territory,
were forcibly seized by Japan during the war of 1894-1895 launched
by Japanese imperialists to annex Korea and China.
</P>
<P>
For peace and friendship, China repeatedly proposed that the
territorial dispute be put on the shelf, with a Sino-Japanese
joint exploration of natural resources around the islands. The
proposal was made strategically to benefit bilateral relations
between China and Japan as well as peace and stability in the
region.
</P>
<P>
When a friendship treaty was signed in 1978, Beijing and Tokyo
agreed to leave resolution of the issue to future generations.
However, Japan has disregarded the treaty and now controls the
uninhabited islands.
</P>
<P>
All this should remind the world to exercise more vigilance
over the actions of a nation which, having achieved economic
power, is so determined in its ambition to become a global
political power.

<HEADLINE> 2,700-Year Old Wild Tea Tree Discovered in Yunnan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, December 20 (Xinhua) -- A 2,700-year old wild tea tree
in southwest China's Yunnan Province, has been described as the
oldest of its kind in the world.
</P>
<P>
It is 1,000 years older than the present "King of Tea Trees",
also found in the province in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
The 2,700-year old tree is 25.5 meters high and has a diameter
of 1.2 m. It was spotted by a group of scientists last month in
Qianjia Village in Zhengyuan County. Close by was a another wild
tea tree, 200 years younger, which is 19.5 m high and has a
diameter of 1.02 m.
</P>
<P>
They are the oldest wild tea trees ever found in the world,
according to experts. The trees are still thriving, despite their
old ages.
</P>
<P>
The trees are in a pristine forest situated 2,100 to 2,500
meters above sea level. The forest where the trees stand covers an
area of 280 hectares, with wild tea trees of a diameter of over 30
cm can be seen everywhere.
</P>
<P>
Simao and Xishuangbanna in south Yunnan are famous tea
production areas. A wild tea tree with an age of over 1,700 years
was found in Menghai County in Xishuangbanna in 1961. It was the
oldest wild tea tree discovered at that that time in the world.
</P>
<P>
The latest discovery provides further proof that Yunnan is the
birth place of tea trees, experts said.

development of Sino-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
Liu said frequent and direct dialogue and meetings between
U.S. and Chinese leaders would give significant impetus to the
development and improvement of relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He said the successful meeting between Jiang and Clinton in
Manila last month had produced a very important and positive
impact on Sino-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
He said maintaining healthy and stable relations between the
U.S. and China not only conforms to the fundamental interests of
the two countries, but also benefits peace and stability in the
Asia-Pacific region and the world as a whole, and helps create a
peaceful, stable, prosperous and glorious 21st century.
</P>
<P>
At present, he said, Sino-U.S. relations had a positive
momentum of improvement and offered a good opportunity for further
development and improvement. Both sides should cherish and
maintain the hard-won situation.
</P>
<P>
Of the differences between the two countries, Liu said, both
sides should seek resolutions through consultations. If some could
not be settled in a short time, both sides should seek common
ground while reserving differences.
</P>
<P>
Liu said Chinese leaders welcomed Gore's planned visit to
China, at the invitation of Premier Li.
</P>
<P>
Present at the meeting on the U.S. side were Secretary of State
Warren Christopher, Acting Assistant to the President for National
Security Affairs Samuel Berger, White House Chief of Staff Leon
Panetta and Ambassador to China James Sasser. On the Chinese side
were Ambassador to the U.S. Li Daoyu and Assistant Foreign
Minister Yang Jiechi.

in the Yellow Sea off the coast of northern China a century ago,
according to a newspaper report.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Nepali Ruling Partner Demands Expulsion of MPs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, December 20 (Xinhua) -- A junior ruling partner in
Nepal has asked the lower house to expel two of its own MPs due to
their attitude toward a no-confidence motion against the
three-party government, it was reported here today.
</P>
<P>
The Nepal Goodwill Party (NSP), third partner of the ruling
coalition led by Sher Bahadur Deuba of the Nepali Congress (NC),
registered separate letters at the parliament on Wednesday and
Thursday demanding the expulsion of its lawmakers Anish Ansari and
Hridyesh Tripathi.
</P>
<P>
The two NSP MPs were among the 102 lower house MPs who earlier
signed a petition claiming that they had lost confidence in Prime
Minister Deuba and his government.
</P>
<P>
A special session of the house, called by King Birendra as
requested by the 102 MPs, is scheduled to begin discussions on the
no-confidence motion on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The NSP in its letters to Speaker Ram Chandra Poudyal said
Ansari and Tripathi have abandoned the party and should be
dismissed from the house in accordance with the constitution. The
NSP has three seats in the house.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, dispute between two factions of the second ruling
party, the National Democratic Party (RPP), over the no-confidence
motion escalated Thursday when two RPP leaders issued contrary
orders.
</P>
<P>
RPP President Surya Bahadur Thapa Thursday asked the party's
parliamentary leader Lokendra Bahadur Chand to order all RPP MPs
to vote in favor of the government, while Chand himself at a
meeting directed the MPs to vote against it.
</P>
<P>
Ten of the RPP's 19 lower house MPs including Thapa Thursday
informed Chand in a collective letter that they will vote against
the no-confidence motion.
</P>
<P>
The motion, expected to be tabled jointly by the RPP's Chand
faction and the main opposition party, the Communist Party of
Nepal (United Marxist Leninist, CPN-UML), requires a majority vote
of 103 to pass in the 205-seat lower house.
</P>
<P>
Under a private agreement between Chand and the UML, Chand
would lead a new RPP-UML coalition government if the present
NC-led government is ousted by the no-confidence motion, sources
here said.
</P>
<P>
Neither the UML nor the NC, the two largest parties in the
country with 88 and 86 seats respectively in the lower house,
could form a stable government in Nepal without support from the
third largest party, RPP.

<HEADLINE> Car Theft Reported to Be on Rise in Bangkok </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 20 (Xinhua) -- The number of cars and
motorcycles stolen here has been soaring this year due to the
rising demand for cars on the black markets in neighboring
countries and growing mastery of overcoming car security systems,
a local daily said today.
</P>
<P>
Between January and October this year, the Metropolitan Police
Bureau received 5,089 reports on car or motorcycle theft,
averaging 500 vehicles a month, the newspaper The Nation reported.
</P>
<P>
Police said many of the vehicles stolen in Thailand are sent
across the border, while others are dismantled and sold as spare
parts, according to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Some orders for the stolen cars even specify the brand and
model of the cars wanted and car thieves could sell stolen
vehicles immediately through smugglers along the border, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
A car worth 40,000 U.S. dollars might be sold at 2,800 to 3,200
dollars and the registration documents of the engine and car
ownership are usually forged, the newspaper quoted city police
sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
Police officers at the bureau said they are short of manpower
and necessary cooperation between Bangkok and provincial police
agencies in cracking down on car theft.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Simulate Nuclear Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 19 (Xinhua) -- United States Energy
Secretary Hazel O'Leary today formally approved a program to
develop new facilities to enable scientists to monitor the
nation's nuclear stockpile and test warheads without exploding
them.
</P>
<P>
The 40 billion U.S. dollar program was unveiled last month
following President Clinton's announced support for the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. As a result of the treaty, U.S.
nuclear weapons scientists have to find new ways to monitor the
reliability of the devices.
</P>
<P>
The 10-year program will cover the construction of major new
facilities for scientists to conduct various experiments,
including simulating the information they would achieve from
actual tests.
</P>
<P>
The first three new facilities are the National Ignition
Facility and the Contained Firing Facility at Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory outside San Francisco, and the Atlas Facility
at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
The Energy Department said that the Nevada Test Site, where the
United States had conducted its nuclear weapons tests, would be
used for other purposes such as solar device testing.

MANILA, December 20 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' debt burden in
the first 11 months of the year declined to 5.6 percent of the
Gross National Product (GNP) from 6.5 percent in the same period
of the last year, according to the Philippine Finance Department.
</P>
<P>
For the first 11 months, the government's gross domestic
borrowings totaled 2.55 billion US dollars, 68 million dollars
below the 2.62 billion dollar program for the period.
</P>
<P>
Its external borrowings for the same period amounted to 772.9
million dollars, 419.6 million US dollars higher than the
programmed 353.3 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The government paid 930 million US dollars in foreign debt,
45.6 million US dollars more than the 885 million US dollar
program.
</P>
<P>
In terms of domestic debt the government paid 393 million US
dollars, still below the programmed 417 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The reduction in the government's debt is part of its efforts
to bring down interest rates in the remaining months of the year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, interest payment for foreign debt is expected to
increase next year due to heavy private sector borrowing this
year.

JAKARTA, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's second N-250 plane
made a successful test flight on Thursday in Bandung, capital of
West Java province, reports reaching here today said.
</P>
<P>
The medium-range commuter plane produced by the state
aircraft-maker Pt. IPTN got off the ground for one hour and half
maiden flight, reports said.
</P>
<P>
The aircraft nicknamed Krincingwesi is the second prototype of
the country's first locally-designed medium-range aircraft, N-250.
</P>
<P>
State Minister of Research and Technology B.J. Habibie, also
IPTN's president who was present on the test flight, said the
Krincingwesi aircraft was designed to carry 68 passengers, a few
more than the first N-250 prototype which can carry 50 passengers.
</P>
<P>
IPTN aimed to win 15 percent of the world market for that
aircraft class, he said.
</P>
<P>
"A study revealed that between 4,000 and 6,000 aircraft of the
N-250 class would be needed in the next two decades," he said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Croat Herzeg-Bosnia State Officially Disbanded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The Bosnian Croat republic
"Herzeg-Bosnia" officially ceased to exist today, the president of
the Muslim-Croat federation, Kresimer Zubak said.
</P>
<P>
"The government and the ministries of Herceg-Bosna
(Herzeg-Bosnia) will no longer function," Zubak said in a letter
to Carl Bildt, the international Bosnian peace coordinator.
</P>
<P>
The Muslims had met requirements of the Croats to hand over
relevant powers to the federation, so the Croats agreed to abolish
the existence of their self-proclaimed "Croatian Republic of
Herzeg-Bosnia," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Croat state, which was not recognized by anyone but
Croatia, was to have been dismantled by August 31 under an
agreement signed two weeks earlier.
</P>
<P>
The Bosnian Croats, however, did not comply then as promised,
and the southwestern city of Mostar effectively continues to be a
divided city.
</P>
<P>
Under U.S. pressure, Muslims and Croats signed a federation
agreement in Washington in 1994 after fighting each other for a
year. But both kept their own government institutions.
</P>
<P>
The federation was confirmed by the Dayton peace agreement
signed last year, under which the country was to be divided into
two entities, with the Bosnian Serb republic as the other half.

<HEADLINE> Panamanians Urge Making of Day to Mourn Victims of Invasion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Several Panamanian popular
organizations are asking the government to make December 20th, the
anniversary of the 1989 U.S. invasion of Panama, the "National
Mourning Day" as a homage to victims of the invasion.
</P>
<P>
Among the organizations are the Union of Construction Workers,
the Center of Studies and Teaching of Panama, Alternate Legal
Assistance of Panama, the November 29th Revolutionary Students
Front and the Independent Students Movement.
</P>
<P>
On December 20, 1989, some 27,000 U.S. troops broke into Panama
to start a six-day military invasion of the central Amercian
country, killing hundreds of Panamanians, mainly civilians.
</P>
<P>
The then Panamanian ruler General Manuel Antonio Noriega was
arrested by the Americans and taken to the U.S. for trials on
drug-trafficking charges. He was later sentensed to 40 years in
prison.
</P>
<P>
"The invasion was a catastrophe for the people and country, in
terms of economic crisis, destruction of businesses,
infrastructure, housing and loss of human lives," said Richardo
Castille, the leader of the Movement of Organizations Against
U.S. Military Bases.
</P>
<P>
Organizations participating in the commemoration activities of
the invasion plan to hold "a great black march" Friday which,
according to the organizers, will represent the mourning of the
Panamanian people.
</P>
<P>
The march would start at 4:00 p.m. (local time), from the Plaza
Porras in downtown Panama City, and end at the El Chorrillo
section, known as a martyr's neighborhood, said the organizers.

<HEADLINE> Exports From Philippine Economic Zones Soar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 20 (Xinhua0 -- Exports receipts from the
Philippines' economic zones in the first 10 months of the year
have soared to 5.13 billion US dollars, already surpassing its
full year target by 100 million US dollars, local press reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Economic Zone Authority (PEZA) documents
released Thursday showed that total exports for the 10-month
period grew 46.5 percent from 3.5 billion dollars last year. The
PEZA attributed the growth to the robust growth of privately owned
industrial sites.
</P>
<P>
US firm Texas Instruments, which operates a facility at the
Baguio Export Processing Zone, ranked as top exporter among
companies in the economic zones. It sales reached 990.26 million
dollars as of October 31.
</P>
<P>
Another heavy exporter is the Philippine Associated Smelting
and Refinery Corp., with total export earnings hitting 456.56
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
PEZA Director General Lilia de Lima credited the rising export
numbers to the increased investments, particularly in electronics,
as well as the expansion of existing firms. Electronics producers
continued to dominate exports.
</P>
<P>
The export zone shipments account for almost a third of the
16.81 billion dollars in total merchandise exports for the first
10 months this year.
</P>
<P>
As of October, special economic zones shipped 2.04 billion
dollar worth of exports, or 76 percent more than 1.16 billion
dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
Despite robust shipments, PEZA failed to meet its 2.85 billion
dollar investment target for the year. So far, it has only
registered 1.7 billion dollar worth of projects.

<HEADLINE> Beijing to Tackle Traffic Jam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 20 (Xinhua) -- A group of people's deputies
have urged the Beijing municipal government to "do something about
the traffic jams", a real headache of 12 million residents of the
Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
The deputies who were elected to speak for Beijingers conveyed
their complaints to city Party Secretary Wei Jianxing and acting
mayor Jia Qinglin during a face-to-face talk on Wednesday, "China
Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
"Traffic jams are commonplace throughout Beijing and have
become a threat to the normal lives of residents," the report
quoted the deputies as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We are happy to know that Beijing will overhaul 255 major
roads by the year 2000. But how about those small lanes?" said
Yang Zhounan, a deputy from the People's Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
Yang suggested that the municipal government should be
persistently tough on pedlars who block the lanes and the randomly
parked cars which always manage to block the backstreets
connecting lanes.
</P>
<P>
"I'm very surprised to know that the computer system used by
the Municipal Traffic Administrative Center was imported in the
early 1980s," blamed Nie Li, a member of National People's
Congress Standing Committee, the country's legislative body.
</P>
<P>
Such a computer system surely cannot react to accidents
efficiently, she added, urging the government to invest more in
road management.
</P>
<P>
The city administrators have said that they will seriously
consider the legislators' suggestions and give each of them an
answer, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report was accompanied by a photo, which highlighted
vehicles stream in both directions on and alongside the Beitaiping
Bridge on the Third Ring Road in Beijing's Haidian District during
rush hours.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has at least one million motor vehicles and eight
million non-motor-vehicles, mainly bicycles. Despite huge
government financial support in building roads, the growth of
roads are far behind that of the vehicles, said an earlier report
of "Beijing Daily".
</P>
<P>
Most of the trunk ways within the third ring road are now in
the state of saturation or over-saturation, it said.
</P>
<P>
The increased volume of traffic and the increasing number of
traffic violations are making traffic congestion worse in the
capital, it said.

BEIJING, December 20 (Xinhua) -- A farmer who was once blown 10
kilometers in a sandstorm told officials in this Chinese capital
how he set out to tame the desert that threatened his home village.
</P>
<P>
Sitting beside the country's Minister of Forestry, the ordinary
farmer gave a speech to dozens of officials from forestry
departments across the country.
</P>
<P>
The farmer Shi Guangyin, 48, is from a small village in
northwest China's Shaanxi Province where the Maowusu, one of

During the last 12 years, Shi and his neighbors have
successfully transformed more than 4,000 hectares of desert into a
thriving oasis, with a tree coverage of over 91 percent.
</P>
<P>
"When I was in my childhood, I often saw our houses being
submerged by flowing sands, so we had to move frequently," he told
his audience.
</P>
<P>
"Once when I was herding sheep in the field, the sand-storm
came and I was blown to another village 10 kilometers away, and a
five-year-old child even lost his life during that sand-storm".
</P>
<P>
"That was when I made up my mind to control the sand when I
grew up", he said.

NANJING, December 20 (Xinhua) -- Two grade-one highways
connecting this capital city of east China's Jiangsu province with
other cities in the province have recently been open to traffic.

the proportion of drug use in the previous year among eighth
graders has more than doubled since 1991, from 11 percent to 24
percent. Among 10th graders, it has risen from 20 percent to 38
percent. And for 12 graders it has risen from 27 percent to 40
percent.
</P>
<P>
Marijuana use has increased sharply since the early 1990s.
Eighteen percent of eighth graders said they had used marijuana in
the previous year, compared with just 6 percent in 1991.
Thirty-four percent of 10th graders said they had used it in the
previous year, compared with 15 percent in 1991. And 36 percent of
high school seniors said so, compared with 22 percent in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 5 percent of high school seniors surveyed said they used
marijuana every day, compared with 2 percent in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The findings indicated the increase in marijuana use is
accompanied by teen-agers' casual attitudes toward the drug and
their belief that it is not harmful.
</P>
<P>
Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala, who released
the survey today, said the Clinton administration was doing its
best to send out the message about the dangers of drugs, alcohol
and tobacco.
</P>
<P>
The secretary stressed that the aggressive fight to change
current drug trends should include increasing teen-agers'
awareness about the dangers of marijuana.
</P>
<P>
Several groups of scientists and researchers called on the
government to re-evaluate its drug education programs, saying zero
tolerance policies alone are too limited and teens should be given
accurate information about why drugs are harmful.
</P>
<P>
The study was conducted by the University of Michigan with the
support by research grants from the National Institute on Drug
Abuse.

<HEADLINE> New York Stocks Shoot Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, December 19 (Xinhua) -- New York stocks shot higher
today, led by consumer and financial issues, with the Dow Jones
industrial average jumping 126.87 points to 6,473.64, a gain of 2
percent.
</P>
<P>
That was the best one-day gain in the blue-chip index since it
rose 110.55 last March 11. But the Dow is still 73 points below
its record high of 6,547.79 set on November 25.
</P>
<P>
The market was led by consumer and financial issues, as bond
prices were driven sharply higher on weak economic data and strong
demand for a Treasury auction of 5-year notes.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by 7 to 3 on the New
York Stock Exchange. Volume was heavy at 522.32 million shares, up
from Wednesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
Broad stock indexes were also sharply higher.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index rose 14.23 to 745.77, and
the NYSE's composite index rose 6.99 to 392.16.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index rose 10.49 to 1,295.87, and the
American Stock Exchange's market added 3.57 to 578.53.
</P>
<P>
Stocks rose with bonds after the government revised
unemployment claims sharply upward and said the nation's trade
deficit had narrowed by 30 percent in October.
</P>
<P>
The market was also encouraged by a report from the
Philadelphia Federal Reserve showing a sharp decline in the area's
general business activity in December.
</P>
<P>
In the afternoon, news of very strong demand for the Treasury
auction helped doubled the Dow's already strong daily gains. The
Treasury sold 12.50 billion U.S. dollars of five-year notes at
6.165 percent, up from 5.95 percent in November.
</P>
<P>
The 30-year Treasury bond's yielding was down to 6.59 percent
from 6.65 percent on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Consumer stocks, such as health care, food and beverages and
household products, all rose, as well as financial stocks as
interest rates declined.
</P>
<P>
Major gainers in Nasdaq trading were Intel, Microsoft, Cisco
Systems and Dell Computer.

<HEADLINE> France Hails Nuclear Safety Cooperation with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 19 (Xinhua) -- France said today that it is
satisfied with cooperations between the Group of Seven (G-7) most
industrialized nations and Russia and Ukraine in nuclear safety in
1996.
</P>
<P>
France, which took over presidency of G-7 on January 1, 1996,
saw the Moscow summit in April held by G-7 countries and Russia on
prevention of nuclear hazards, and the closing of a reactor in the
Chernobyl nuclear center by Ukraine on November 30, as two mile
stones of such achievements.
</P>
<P>
Claude Mandil, General Director in Charge of Energy and Primary
Materials of the Ministry of Industry, described the assessment by
France on efforts to keep nuclear safety and security by former
Soviet countries as "very satisfying."
</P>
<P>
He said that the agreement signed in 1995 between G-7 and
Ukraine over the closing of Chernobyl nuclear center was put into
work from the beginning of 1996, and was partially achieved with
the closing of Reactor One of Chernobyl on November 30.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Ukraine has been restructuring its energy
industry by building conventional energy projects with 900 million
U.S. dollars of loans from G-7 countries.
</P>
<P>
Mandil also said that the agreement signed in Moscow in April
between G-7 countries and Russia over nuclear safety measures is
yielding results.
</P>
<P>
He cited as examples the coming into force on October 24 of the
International Convention on Nuclear Safety, the signing by Russia
and Ukraine of the Vienna Convention on Civil Nuclear
Responsibility, and the common program on fighting trafficking of
nuclear materials.

<P>
ZAGREB, December 19 (Xinhua) - the Croatian and Hungarian
governments as well as a UN administrative body on Thursday signed
an agreement on the opening of a border-crossing between Hungary
and Croatia's Eastern Slavonia.
</P>
<P>
Border crossing between Hungary and Eastern Slavonia has been
closed since the region was taken over by Croatian Serbs in 1991.
Under an agreement signed last December, Eastern Slavonia will
return to Croatia after a maximum two year transition period under
the UN administration.
</P>
<P>
The agreement on Thursday said that the Knezevo-Udvar crossing,
to be opened from January 1997, will allow civilian transport by
vehicles with Croatian plates through the U.N.-administered area
for the first time in five years.

<HEADLINE> U.S. TV Industry Unveils Rating System Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Television industry in the
United States unveiled a plan today to rate programs to help
parents shield their kids from excessive sex and violence.
</P>
<P>
The six-tier, age-based rating system is expected to start in
January on both broadcast and cable television.
</P>
<P>
The system is similar to the one used on movies now, ranging
from "TV-G," designating material suitable for all ages, to
"TV-M," for mature audiences only.
</P>
<P>
Children's shows will be labeled, using a "TV-Y" as suitable
for all youngsters and "TV-Y-7" as appropriate for children 7 and
older. Each ratings category carries a content description.
</P>
<P>
But child-advocacy groups, parent and teacher organizations and
some lawmakers said the system was too vague and they want
specific warnings for violence, sex and language.
</P>
<P>
Unlike movies, which are rated by an independent board
including parents, TV shows will be rated by producers, networks,
cable channels, syndicators and others that originate programs.
</P>
<P>
Clinton who pressured the TV industry to apply the self-rating
system, welcomed the its effort but said parents deserve a chance
to test the system and tell industry officials what they think.
</P>
<P>
"We might be able to make it better," he said. "The parents
groups, the advocacy groups deserve to be heard and considered.
But we are now doing what I think ought to be done."
</P>
<P>
If the Federal Communications Commission finds the TV
industry's ratings unsuitable, it would appoint an independent
advisory board to create a new system.

<HEADLINE> IDB Approves $85 Mln for Argentine Water Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB) today announced the approval of 85 million
U.S. dollar in financing to support the investment plan of an
Argentine water and sewerage company.
</P>
<P>
It is the first financing by IDB's private sector department
for a water and sanitation project, and also the first IDB
financing for an Argentine utility company outside of the Buenos
Aires metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
The IDB resources will help Aguas Provinciales de Santa Fe S.A.
finance the rehabilitation and expansion of water treatment and
sewerage facilities, improving the overall quality of the
services.
</P>
<P>
The financing consists of a 30 million dollar loan from the
IDB's ordinary capital, and a second loan of 55 million dollars
from syndicated funds provided by commercial banks through
participation agreements with the IDB.
</P>
<P>
The Argentina company provides services to an area that
includes 60 percent of the province's population. The company
supplies potable water to some 1.5 million people and offers
sewerage services to 750,000 customers.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the IDB's Multilateral Investment Fund (MIF), an
autonomous fund administered by the IDB, approved a 3 million
dollar grant for small rural producers in Argentina to help
improve the business management skills and competitiveness.

<HEADLINE> Round-up: Year 1996 Sees Record Number of Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The year 1996 has seen a
record number of U.S. enterprises merging at record pace with
a staggering value of 537 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Prominent among them is Computer Associates international Inc,
one of the world's largest software companies, which in a buying
spree bought Cheynenne Software Inc., a maker of mass storage
software for business computers. The merger is the third largest in
software history trailing only Computer Associates Acquisition of
Legent and the Interanional business Machine Corporation's three
billion U.S. dollar purchase of the Lotus Development Corporation
last year.
</P>
<P>
Other striking examples are Mattel, the world's largest toy
maker, which merged with Tyco, America's third largest toy
company; CSX Corporation, a big railroad that blankets the
Southeast, Middle Atlantic and eastern Midwest, which acquired
Conrail Inc, the freight railroad that dominates The Northeast.
The deal valued at 8.4 billion U.S. dollars is the biggest yet in
cascade of deals that has been combining railroads since the
deregulation of the industry in the 1980's.
</P>
<P>
The transactions took place largely in such businesses as
banking, retailing, telecommunications and health care which found
themselves unable to compete by means of raising prices or
increasing production. Taking telecommunication as example. Four
mergers have occurred since the beginning of this year with total
value of 73.2 billion U.S. dollars. By so doing, the businesses
reduced their costs and met requirements in markets.
</P>
<P>
Economic analysts attributed the quickening of businesses'
merger to intensified competition, deregulation by the Federal
Government, bullish stocks and slow growth of earnings. Modest
economic growth, no visible inflation and no change of interest
rate are also factors contributing to enterprises taking steps
towards merger.
</P>
<P>
Economists described the merger as a main trend in U.S.
business activities and they expect more enterprises to merge in
the coming year in the struggle for survival and growth.

<P>
PARIS, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Louis Viannet, General Secretary
of the powerful French trade union Confederation Generale du
Travail (CGT), today officially submitted his resignation from the
leading nation bureau of the French Communist Party (PCF).
</P>
<P>
Viannet told 1,100 PCF delegates at the on-going 29th Congress
of the PCF that his quitting the PCF leadership is ``a wishable
and necessary move'' which is aimed at separating more clearly the
function of the union from that of the party.
</P>
<P>
He denied that there are differences of view between him and
the PCF National Secretary, Robert Hue, or that he disagrees with
the ``work undertaken by the party.''
</P>
<P>
The Agence France Presse (AFP) said that the resignation of
Viannet from PCF leadership is a logical evolution of the
relationship between the union and the party, whose layout was
inherited from the Third Internationale.
</P>
<P>
CGT's close relationship with the PCF is still maintained, as
is shown by the make-up of the leading confederate bureau of GCT,
among whose 16 members are eight PCF members, said AFP.

LONDON, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The Irish Republican Army (IRA)
could be planning pre-Christmas attacks on shopping centers in the
British capital and people should keep an eye out for any
suspicious activity, London's chief of police warned today.
</P>
<P>
Metropolitan Police Commissioner Paul Condon said the IRA had a
history of launching attacks against shoppers crowding into the
city before Christmas, seeing it as a prime time to publicize
their cause.
</P>
<P>
Condon said his force was on alert for assassinations, bomb
attacks and fire-bombings, urging people in London to be on their
guard.
</P>
<P>
According to BBC Television, anti-terrorist police have
appealed for information about a Ford Iveco lorry that may have
used by the IRA to transport bomb-making equipment.
</P>
<P>
It is believed the vehicle may have been used to take material
from Northern Ireland to the mainland.
</P>
<P>
The IRA abandoned a 17-month cease-fire in February and
detonated a huge device in eastern London in the first of a series
of bombings on the mainland to press its campaign for a united
Ireland.

<HEADLINE> Rallies Supporting Milosevic Staged throughout Serbia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Rallies offering support to
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic and condemning the
subservient attitude by a part of the opposition parties were held
throughout Serbia on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to Tanjug news agency, these rallies were organized
by local branches of the ruling Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS)
headed by Milosevic to counter against the opposition coalition's
daily protest demonstrations in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
Addressing some 20,000 people who had gathered in Krusevac in
central Serbia, leader of the local board of the SPS Miloje
Mihajlovic said that, at a time when it was crucial to meet the
obligations assumed under the Dayton peace accords, some power
wielders in the world had spurred the opposition to stage rallies,
accusing authorities of the violation of human rights and
democratic principles.
</P>
<P>
"These power wielders have found allies in a group of traitors
who want to seize power at all costs," Tanjug quoted Mihajlovic as
saying. He said leaders of the opposition coalition Zajedno had
run against the people's will and through foreign assistance to
wreck and sell the country.
</P>
<P>
Referring to protest marches by supporters of the coalition
Zajedno, Sabac Mayor Marko Maksimovic said, "The marches through
Serbia do not recognize efforts by legally elected bodies or
authorities elected through the Serbian people's will."
</P>
<P>
In Backa Palanka in Serbia's northern province of Vojvodina,
about 10,000 people gathered in the town offering support to
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
The rally, held under the slogan "Serbia will not be ruled by a
foreign hand," expressed dissatisfaction with what they called,
"aggressive, undemocratic and anti-patriotic activity of the
coalition Zajedno."
</P>
<P>
The rally said the opposition coalition used the results of the
November polls only as an excuse for its activity aimed at
creating chaos in the country and overthrowing the political
system.
</P>
<P>
A pro-government rally, organized by the local board of the
SPS, was also staged in Gornji Milanovac. The demonstration
organizers sent a telegram to Milosevic, stressing that the people
wanted all outstanding issues to be resolved within legal
institutions and not under the flags of states whose presence in
Serbia had always meant bloodshed, war, discord among brothers and
ever new blackmails.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Dispatches Envoy to Middle East </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Warren Christopher said on Thursday that he is dispatching senior
envoy Dennis Ross to the Middle East for consultations with the
Israelis and Palestinians, in an effort to salvage stalled peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a year-end news conference, Christopher said: "I
still have confidence in the peace process. The United States
cannot fail to assist the parties and stand by the parties as they
take risks for peace."
</P>
<P>
But in contrast with President bill Clinton's criticism this
week of Israel's expanding settlements in the West Bank,
Christopher urged the Palestinians to respond to Israeli overtures
and conclude a long-elusive agreement on Hebron as a step toward a
broader peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
"The Israelis have made some moves and it's time for the
Palestinians to reciprocate," he said.
</P>
<P>
Israel was reported to have offered to reopen a main street in
the West Bank city that was closed last year as a deterrent to
violence.
</P>
<P>
Christopher, however, reiterated that Israel's settlements
policy concerned him.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government decided
last week to revive subsidies and tax break for Jewish settlers on
the West Bank and in Gaza.
</P>
<P>
The effect, Christopher said, is to "move ahead of where the
parties are now."

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The UN Security Council
"vigorously condemn the occupation of the residence of the
Ambassador of Japan in Lima, Peru, and the taking of hostages by
terrorist elements," Council President Paolo Fulci of Italy said
here today.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to press, the Italian ambassador said, "This
intolerable act constitutes also an assault against the
international community as a whole."
</P>
<P>
The Security Council has always firmly condemned terrorist
acts, whatever the circumstances, in the most unequivocal terms,
he said.
</P>
<P>
"Such acts constitute a violation of basic principles of
international law and of human rights, as well as an attempt to
jeopardize the democratic system and threaten peace and security,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The members of the Council express their solidarity with the
governments of Peru and Japan, as well as with the governments of
all countries concerned, and appeal for the immediate release of
all officials, diplomats and other persons being held hostage, he
said.
</P>
<P>
A group of guerrillas took hundreds of international
dignitaries hostage on Tuesday night when the Japanese ambassador
hosted a reception in honor of his Emperor's birthday.
