<HEADLINE> Czech Sticks to One-China Policy: Foreign Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The Czech Republic will continue
to stick to the One China policy, regarding Taiwan as an
inalienable part of China, Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec said
here today.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with visiting Chinese Vice Premier and Foreign
Minister Qian Qichen, Zieleniec said that his country will not
develop official relations with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Zieleniec stressed that his country attaches due importance to
the development of its relations with China, expressing the hope
that they will be further strengthened.
</P>
<P>
He said Czech entrepreneurs has shown keen interest in doing
business and making investment in China and this should be
supported by the governments of both countries.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Qian expressed his appreciation over Czech's
One China policy.
</P>
<P>
He said China attaches much importance to its ties with the
Czech Republic and hopes to promote the friendly and cooperative
relations with the republic.
</P>
<P>
On economic and trade cooperation, Qian said the two countries
have had good cooperation in this field but there still exists
great potential for increasing such cooperation and thus joint
efforts are needed to push bilateral cooperation in this field to
a new level.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers also exchanged views on international and
regional issues of mutual concern.
</P>
<P>
Qian also met here today with the Czech Minister of Industry

During the meeting, the two sides shared the view that keeping
good bilateral relations between China and the Czech Republic
conforms to the fundamental interest of the peoples of the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that the governments of the two countries should
work to create a good political atmosphere for the development of
economic and trade cooperation between enterprises of the two
countries, encourage them to strengthen direct links and thus push
forward the bilateral economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Dlouhy also said his country supports China's entry into the
World Trade Organization.

<HEADLINE> Sanctions on Afghanistan Deserves Consideration: US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 21 (Xinhua) -- US Assistant Secretary of State
for South Asian Affairs Robin Raphel said here today that the idea
of imposing arms sanctions against Afghanistan in order to bring
peace to that country deserves consideration.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a news conference, she said, "During the Security
Council debate on Afghanistan about a week ago several countries
suggested that we can approach the problem through an arms
embargo."
</P>
<P>
"We haven't fully developed our own talks about that and by and
large most of the parties I have talked to have been interested in
the idea," she said.
</P>
<P>
She said the humanitarian concern in the war-ravaged country
and the development of economic potential in the region have
heightened the US interests in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
"Recently we focused on the economic potential in the region
and how Afghanistan can play an important role -- We have an
American company which is interested in building a pipeline from
Turkmenistan through to Pakistan."
</P>
<P>
Despite intense diplomatic efforts both inside and outside
Afghanistan, the U.S. has no intention of taking a direct
mediatory role, she said.
</P>
<P>
"We will not have a direct mediatory role, we will be very
strongly behind the UN mission launched in the first place and we
have been supportive of that mission."
</P>
<P>
"We are looking for ways to give it even more support which
translates into possibility more staff and perhaps larger budget
and so on."
</P>
<P>
Raphel arrived here on Wednesday for a five-day visit to
Pakistan and Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
She held talks with Pakistani President Farooq Leghari, Prime
Minister Benazir Bhutto and other high-ranking officials.
</P>
<P>
She flew into Kabul on Friday for talks with President
Burhanuddin Rabbani and his commander Ahmed Masood, and with
Taliban leaders in the southern Afghan city of Kandahar.

<HEADLINE> zimbabwe to Recover Grain From Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government will
start next month recovering the grain it lent to over six million
Zimbabweans who appealed for food assistance through the grain
loan scheme launched in May last year.
</P>
<P>
Public Service, Labor and Social Welfare Minister Nathan
Shamuyarira said today that most of the beneficiaries of the
scheme would be able to pay back some maize because they had a
good crop this year.
</P>
<P>
During the last drought, more than 600,000 tons of grain were
distributed through the grain loan scheme, but the minister said
400,000 tons of maize was expected to be paid back this year.
</P>
<P>
He said that the repaid grain would be kept as part of the
strategic reserve set aside to cushion the country from future
droughts.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government has promised to continue giving
relief food to those who did not receive good rains this year and
still needed state assistance, he said.

ATHENS, April 21 (Xinhua) -- the Greek government has decided
to combat surging inflation which rose to 9.1 percent in march, up
from 8.1 percent at the end of 1995.
</P>
<P>
The food and fuel market will be under tight control and
charges for electricity, telephone and water consumption will
remain unchanged until the end of the year. And agreement will be
made with industrial and commercial sectors to keep a lid on
prices.
</P>
<P>
The "hard drachma" policy which has seen the Greek currency
appreciate this year against most European currencies will be
continued so as to keep prices of imported goods down.
</P>
<P>
A committee of experts is drafting a report recommending
measures to help clamp down on public spending.
</P>
<P>
The five percent inflation target set for 1996 is unlikely to
be met, but a seven percent target seems more realistic, informed
sources said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government has
embarked on a major project to enhance the capacity of the
country's 57 rural district councils (RDCS) so that they can
manage on their own development projects.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, to be implemented by the Ministry of Local
Government, Rural and Urban Development, funding of capital
projects will be made directly to the councils who will be
expected to manage the projects on their own.
</P>
<P>
The main aim was to promote accountability and decentralise
central government functions in line with the restructuring of
the civil service taking place under market reforms launched more
than five years ago.
</P>
<P>
According to the ministry, the program will ''adopt a process
approach to implementation, whereby funding for capital projects
will be made available to RDCS to stimulat a learning process of
action''.
</P>
<P>
At least eight rural district council provincial support teams
will be established. The teams will provide organisational
development consultancy to the rural district councils, including
support to identify and resolve institutional weaknesses, said
the ministry. enditem

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The World Food Program (WFP)
pledged to extend a 10.5 million US dollars worth of food aid to
Ethiopia, the Ethiopian News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report said the stated amount of emergency relief food
would be enough for half a million drought-affected people in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Accoridng to the WFP, about 2-3 million Ethiopians face
shortages of food this year. The food shortage was due to the
damage of agricultural crops and displacement of people in the
regions.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Ethiopian News Agency today also reported that
the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
recently asked donor countries for 20 million US dollars to
complete the repatriation of 56,000 Ethiopian refugees who still
live in neighbouring countries.
</P>
<P>
According to the UNHCR, since the change of government in
1991, nearly one million Ethiopians have returned to their
country. But about 50,000 are still in Sudan, 40,000 in Kenya and
more than 2,000 in Djibouti and 500 others are scattered in
various other countries. enditem

<HEADLINE> Peres: Four Ways to End Fighting in Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Shimon
Peres said here today that there are four ways to end the
fighting between the Israeli army and Hezbollah militants in
south Lebanon, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Peres, speaking at a weekly cabinet meeting, said that "the
ideal way" is to reach a cease-fire along with understandings and
to restore calm on the two sides of the Israeli-Lebanese border.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli premier made the remarks as Israeli warplanes and
artillery continued to carry out strikes against Hezbollah
positions in south Lebanon, while Hezbollah fired more Katyusha
rockets at northern Israeli towns and villages.
</P>
<P>
More than 150 Lebanese civilians have been killed since the
Israeli military operation against Hezbollah, code-named Operation
Grapes of Wrath, started on April 11, and tens of thousands of
residents on both sides of the border have fled their homes.
</P>
<P>
The second possibility to end the fighting, presented to
today's cabinet meeting by Peres, was a temporary cease-fire,
which will then allow the concerned parties to work out the
understandings.
</P>
<P>
The third case was described as an "interim agreement" with
Lebanon, which Peres referred to as "highly unlikely."
</P>
<P>
The fourth way is to resume peace negotiations with Syria, a
country which the Israeli leader called as "the real address" in
the crisis in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Peres, who broke off the peace talks last month after a series
of suicide bombing attacks in Israel, said that he will not object
to the resumption of talks with the Syrians, which had been held
in the U.S. state of Maryland.
</P>
<P>
Also today, Peres met with visiting U.S. Secretary of State
Warren Christopher, who is on the second day of his shuttle
diplomacy between Israel and Syria, in an effort to bring a
cease-fire in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Christopher, who held several hours of talks with Syrian
President Hafez al-Assad Saturday, delivered a message on a
possible cease-fire arrangement from al-Assad to Peres at the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
No details on the arrangement were given at a joint press
conference following their meeting. However, both of them
expressed confidence in reaching a cease-fire in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
Christopher is due to go back to Syria this evening to hold
further discussions with al-Assad, while Russian Foreign Minister
Yevgeny Primakov arrived here this afternoon from Lebanon to meet
with Israeli leaders.
</P>
<P>
Primakov, as well as French Foreign Minister Herve de
Charette, Italian Foreign Minister Susan Agnelli and Iranian
Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati, also visited Syria on
Saturday to make diplomatic efforts to end the fighting in
Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Assassination Plot against Arafat Made Public In </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian security
authorities laid bare in Gaza today a plot of the Islamic
Resistance Movement (Hamas) to assassiate Palestinian Authority
(PA) President Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
A Hamas cell called "Group of Seven" was allegedly to carry out
the assassination next Sunday, according to a report of JMCC, a
Palestinian press service based in east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Six members of the group appeared at a press conference in the
PA intelligence office in Deir al-Balah this afternoon. A weapons
cache was also displayed on the occasion.
</P>
<P>
The Director of PA Intelligence in the southern Gaza Strip,
Col. Tawfiq Jabr, said that the Group of Seven is one of Hamas'
secret units and they had turned themselves in recently. The group
called itself the "Revenge Units," and its job was to respond to
any Israeli assassination of Hamas leaders. It began working about
a year ago, according to Jabr, after the death of Hamas military
leader Kaml Kneil on April 2, 1995.
</P>
<P>
Mu'taz Kheil and Khaled Quqa answered questions at the press
conference. Quqa, who is from the Shate' Refugee Camp, was
arrested by Israel on charges of membership in Hamas. Kheil, of
the Sheikh Radwan Neighborhood in Gaza, was identified as the
administrative coordinator of the group.
</P>
<P>
Quqa revealed that the group's supervisor was Ziad Qishawi,
who fled to Jordan after Kheil's killing. Qishawi sent orders
three months ago to monitor Arafat's convoy as he visits Martyr's
Cemestery in Gaza so as to kill him there.
</P>
<P>
He explained that Arafat usually visits the cemestery on every
Moslem holiday. Next Sunday will be Eid al-Adha, a Moslem holiday
marking the end of the pilgrimage (Haj) to Mecca.
</P>
<P>
The group rejected the orders and its contact with Qishawi
broke off. After that, the group decided to turn itself in.
</P>
<P>
Jabr disclosed that Arafat had issued a presidential amnesty
for the entire group in appreciation of their decision.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Friendship Tour Spanning Oceans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHUHAI, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Qiao Shi, chairman of the Standing
Committee of the Chinese National Congress (NPC) arrived here
today, wrapping up a five-nation tour of Ukraine, Russia, Greece,
Cuba and Canada.
</P>
<P>
During the 25-day visit, Qiao held meetings with heads of
state, government and parliament as well as some local leaders and
discussed with them bilateral relations and other issues of common
concern, reaching broad consensus.
</P>
<P>
"The trip has been a complete success and the original goal of
expanding consensus and enhancing understanding has been met,
pushing the relations between China and the host countries to a
new high," Cao Zhi, secretary general of the NPC Standing
Committee, said today.
</P>
<P>
Qiao's visit, which spanned several continents and the Pacific
and Atlantic oceans, have helped consolidate the friendly ties
between China and the five countries, Cao said.
</P>
<P>
The five countries have attached great importance to Qiao's
visit and extended warm hospitality.
</P>
<P>
Qiao made the first stop in Ukraine, which established
diplomatic ties with China four years ago.
</P>
<P>
During Qiao's meetings with Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma,
Prime Minister Evgeny Marchuk and Chairman Alexandr Moroz of the
Supreme Soviet, the two sides agreed to open up fronts of
cooperation and tap on the potential in bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
During his meetings with leaders of Russia, the second leg of
the tour, Qiao spelt out China's principles in its relations with
Russia, which includes respect of the choices made by the Russian
people, non-interference in Russia's internal affairs as well as a
conciliatory attitude in seeking resolutions to some of the
outstanding issues in Sino-Russian ties.
</P>
<P>
During his transit visit to Greece, Qiao met with Greek
President Costis Stephanopoulos, parliament speaker Apostolos
Kaklamanis and both sides expressed satisfaction with the
development of friendly relations between the two countries since
the establishment of diplomatic ties since 1972.
</P>
<P>
From Athens, Qiao and his entourage flew over the Atlantic
Ocean and reached Havana, capital of Cuba, another high point of
the visit.
</P>
<P>
Qiao applauded Cuba's efforts in finding a socialist
construction road that suits the actual condition of the country,
confronting outside pressures. He said that Cuba, by adopting a
more flexible reform and open-up policy, is gradually recovering
from a difficult economy and winning sympathy from more and more
countries.
</P>
<P>
All the four countries have reiterated their support for
China's stance on the Taiwan, Tibet and human rights issues.
</P>
<P>
In Canada, the final leg of his tour, Qiao held meetings with
Governor General Romeo LeBlanc, Prime Minister Jean Chretien,
Senator Speaker Gildas Molgat, Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy.
</P>
<P>
During the meetings, both sides reached agreement that the
current good bilateral relations would be furthered in the years
to come. Qiao said China and Canada have no conflict of
fundamental interests nor historical haggling, therefore posing no
threats to each others' security.
</P>
<P>
The two countries should, with a perspective of the overall
situation and the future, transcend their difference in social
systems and ideology and work together to keep bilateral relations
always on the friendship track, Qiao said.
</P>
<P>
The five-nation tour, which started March 28, shortly after the
conclusion of the fourth session of the eighth National People's
Congress, also provided Qiao with an opportunity to brief leaders
of the host countries on the resolutions passed during the
session, especially the one on the ninth Five-year Plan and the
long term development blueprint for the next 15 years.
</P>
<P>
Observers say that Qiao's visit has built up a friendship and
cooperation bridge linking China and the five countries, and it
will help further the development of all-around and lasting
friendly bilateral ties during the cross-century period.

SOUR, LEBANON, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Despite intensive
diplomatic efforts to end the conflict between Israel and
Hezbollah, cross-border exchange of gunfire continued today in
south Lebanon, wounding more people.
</P>
<P>
The fighting has entered its 11th day since Israel launched
Operation Grapes of Wrath April 11 to stop the Iranian-backed
Hezbollah, or Party of God, rocketing northern Galilee.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria To Install New Radars For Safer Aviation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria is expected to spend more
than 9.5 billion Naira (about 111 million US Dollars) to acquire
and install 11 secondary radars in a bid to build up a safer and
more effective aviation industry.
</P>
<P>
The secondary radars, said Alhaji Sani Baba, Managing Director
of the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN), would be
used to augment the existing six primary terminal radars which
covered only a few kilometers within the areas of their locations.
</P>
<P>
Sani Baba said that FAAN had entered into an understanding
with the International Civil Aviation Organization which would
vet, design and source the equipment for the radars as well as
ensure longevity, provide training and maintenance.
</P>
<P>
He also said the European Union had donated eight of the 15
data based satellite radio communication systems approved for
Central and West Africa to be sited in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The international cooperation indicated that the imposition of
sanctions against Nigeria since last November by some western
countries had not affected the operations of the nation's
aviation industry.
</P>
<P>
The News Agency of Nigeria quoted Sani Baba as saying here
today that FAAN had also taken precautionary measures to
forestall acts of terrorism and further enhance security at the
nation's 20 airports, apart from seeking better technology.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Middle East Peace Process Faces New Challenges (by Lu Shao Ming) (I) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Since March 11, Israeli forces
have launched air, land and naval raids on the towns and villages
of south Lebanon and the southern suburb of Beirut, killing more
than 180 civilians, wounding over 300 others and displacing about
half a million of Lebanese.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Hezbollah (Party of God) guerrillas launched
Katyusha rocket attacks on northern Israel in retaliation for its
aggression, and the fierce confrontations between the two sides
led to an escalation of tension in the region.
</P>
<P>
This incident is the most serious one between the two countries
since the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982, which poses grave
challenges to the Middle East peace process and security in the
region.
</P>
<P>
The immediate cause of the brutal Israeli aggression was
attributed to a mere launching of two Katyusha rockets by the
Hezbollah at Kiryat Shimona in northern Israel on April 10, which
was in response to the killing of a Lebanese child and the injury
of three others in an Israeli bombardment on south Lebanon on the
eve of April 8.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese government maintained that the incessant Israeli
raids on south Lebanon constituted a flagrant aggression against
Lebanon's sovereignty, a grave threat to its security and
stability, and a brutally criminal act against the Lebanese people.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon reiterated that the right path that might lead to peace
between Lebanon and Israel was an Israeli unconditional withdrawal
from south Lebanon in implementation of U.N. Security Council
resolution 425.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik al Hariri said said time and
again that should Israel cease its shelling of south Lebanon,
Syria would be willing to help to halt the Hezbollah
actions. Otherwise, he said, it would be a farewell to the
regional peace process.
</P>
<P>
But Israel claimed that its military operations in south
Lebanon were not directed against Syria and Lebanon, and that it
was merely striking the Hezbollah militiamen inside Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres stressed that he put the
security of Israel and the Israelis above all considerations,
saying that the Israeli raids were only aimed at destroying
Hezbollah strongholds in south Lebanon in order to prevent the
militiamen from launching Katyusha rocket attacks on northern
Israel.
</P>
<P>
The international community, particularly the Arab world,
expressed profound concern over the Israeli raids. More and more
Arab states as well as the Arab League (AL) issued statements
condemning the Israel aggression and pooling support for Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Middle East Peace Process Faces New </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Egypt intensified its diplomatic efforts to end the Israeli
aggression as the number of innocent civilian victims was rising
steadily. Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa was entrusted by
President Hosni Mubarak to make broad contacts to halt the Israeli
aggression.
</P>
<P>
Syria declared its support for Lebanon's just cause against the
Israeli aggression and criticized the U.S. bias in favor of
Israel, warning that the U.S. might lose its credibility as
co-sponsor of the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Observers in Cairo believe that since the peace march is once
again facing extremely grave challenges, a peaceful solution has
to be found to end as early as possible the Lebanese crisis and
avoid further negative consequences of the Israeli aggression on
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
In a concerted international effort to bring about a
cease-fire, the foreign ministers of Russia, U.S., France and
Italy arrived in the Syrian capital of Damascus Saturday for talks
with Syrian officials. Syrian is considered to be a major backer
of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
This move took place in the wake of an appeal for an immediate
cease-fire by the G-7 in a meeting in Moscow. It is reported that
the four ministers discussed about an incorporation of the
U.S. and French cease-fire initiatives so as to work out proposals
for an agreement that would lead to ending the current crisis.
</P>
<P>
In Tel Aviv Friday, U.S. coordinator for the peace process
Dennis Ross also met with Israeli officials to discuss the
U.S. efforts to bring about a cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here maintain that the Israeli raids against south
Lebanon seemed directed at Hezbollah militiamen with an aim to
guarantee the security of Israel and the Israelis. But, the real
cause behind is that, Peres, by launching the military operation,
wanted to strengthen his position in the forthcoming elections in
May, because more and more Israelis had been inclined to believe
that the peace process no longer served as effective guarantee of
their security.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli voters' growing anxiety and doubt about the policy
of Peres in the Middle East peace process was at least one of the
most important factors behind the decision by Peres to launch the
attacks on south Lebanon, analysts here say.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli raids, however, did not achieve the objectives of
the mastermind, nor did they constitute a threat to Hezbollah
militiamen who has a substantial force in south Lebanon. On the
contrary, Hezbollah found it was gaining growing material and
moral support from Arab and Islamic states and from Shiite
Moslems. As put by Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik al Hariri, the
operation against Lebanon had not succeeded in influencing
Hezbollah or in destroying it, and the only solution is still to
be achieved through political dialogue rather than military
operation.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian parties Release Prisoners of War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Muslim authorities in
Sarajevo released Serb Army Colonel Aleksa Krsmanovic today,
Tanjug news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Krsmanovic and 10 other Serb prisoners who were released by
Bosnian Croats in Mostar were escorted to the Serb administrative
center Pale by Michael Steiner, deputy to High Representative for
Bosnian civilian affairs Carl Bildt.
</P>
<P>
Muslim authorities arrested Krsmanovic and Serb Army General
Djordje Djukic on January 30 in Sarajevo while they were on their
way to a meeting with IFOR officials.
</P>
<P>
The two Serb senior officers were later extradited to the Hague
for further investigation on war crime charges.
</P>
<P>
Three weeks ago, the Hague war crimes tribunal ruled there was
no evidence to indict Krsmanovic for war crimes and the Serb
Colonel was transferred back to Sarajevo where Muslim authorities
instituted legal proceedings against him.
</P>
<P>
But there was no grounds for further legal actions against him,
Krsmanovic, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Serb authority today released a Bosnian Croat,
Ivan Stjepanovic, and a Muslim from Srebrenica, Ibran Mustafic.
</P>
<P>
Stjepanovic, a member of the 108th brigade of the Bosnian Croat
Army, had been sentenced to death at the end of March for war
crimes committed against Serb civilians, Tanjug said.
</P>
<P>
Stjepanovic and Mustafic left Pale for Sarajevo accompanied by
Michael Steiner who had earlier escorted Krsmanovic and 10 other
Serb prisoners to Pale.

<HEADLINE> G-24 Urges Early Finalization of Debt-relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The G-24 financial ministers
today urged all concerned multilateral and bilateral creditors to
quickly work out a debt-relief action plan for heavily indebted
poor countries.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was contained in the communique issued following the
two-day 67th Meeting of the Deputies and 54th Meeting of the
Ministers of the International Group of 24 on International
Monetary Affairs in Washington.
</P>
<P>
They emphasized that any workable solution would require
additionality of resources, so as to preclude any transfer of
limited concessional resource from one set of objectives to
another. The G-24 ministers voiced their support for the World
Bank and IMF managements' proposal that Paris Club creditors
provide net present value concessionality of up to 90 percent in
flow rescheduling and stock of debt operations.
</P>
<P>
It noted with satisfaction the continued good performance of
the world economy to which developing countries had contributed
markedly through their much stronger performance, which was
largely the outcome of their sustained macroeconomic and
structural reform efforts.
</P>
<P>
The G-24 represents developing countries from Asia, Africa and
Latin America who held their sessions ahead of next week's joint
meeting of governors of the IMF and World Bank. The
debt-alleviation proposal is highlighted in the meeting.
</P>
<P>
According to the World Bank data, 20 of the poorest countries
are saddled with back-breaking and almost unsustainable debts
amounting to 97 billion U.S. dollars. Of that total, some 56.3
billion dollars is bilateral debt and some 21.4 billion dollars is
owned to the IMF, the World Bank and regional development banks.
The IMF and the Bank are planning to put forward a new assistance
program which could cut 7-8 billion dollars from the debts of poor
nations.

<P>
NEW YORK, April 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. citizens are becoming more
resentful with their government failure to pay its due assessment
to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Many Americans have sent checks with brief comments to the U.N.
secretariat, expressing their embarrassment and anger with
Washington in this regard, according to the New York Times.
</P>
<P>
"We are ashamed of our government's negligence in this most
vital matter to world peace and prosperity," the paper today
quoted Josephine Martin and Robert J. Schwartz of New York City as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The United States owes 1.6 billion dollars to the U.N., almost
half of the total debt owed by its member states to the world

It is estimated that if each American paid just 4.40 dollars,
all the U.S. arrears would be wiped out altogether.
</P>

A voluntary contribution by individuals has started since last
October and so far 1,963 payments have been recorded, totaling

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Ethnic Minorities to Form Political Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Ethnic minorities in New
Zealand will launch a political party within four weeks to take
part in the general elections later this year, local press reports
said today.
</P>
<P>
One report quoted Malaysian-born investment adviser Robert Hum
as saying the party would call itself the Ethnic Minority Party
of New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
The move comes as New Zealand First leader Winston Peters
mounted an anti-immigration platform which has attracted claims it
is anti-Asian.
</P>
<P>
The new party will focus on Pacific Island, Maori, Asian and
Fiji Indian voters who make up about 27 percent of the NZ
population. It also intends to provide a voice in the parliament
for all ethnic minorities.
</P>
<P>
"I think the Asian people are saying back to Winston Peters
'since you have used the race card in the forthcoming elections we
have no other choice but to group ourselves under a real party as
well'."
</P>
<P>
But the government's race relations conciliator Rayon Prasad
said that he could not see how the formation of a racially based
party would assist NZ race relations.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Engagement with Asia Top Priority of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Australian foreign minister
Alexander Downer has done his best to sell the Coalition
Government's foreign policy to its Asian neighbors during his
first overseas visit since taking office.
</P>
<P>
In the past week, Downer repeated a single "simple" message
again and again when he toured around Indonesia, Singapore and
Thailand. The message is that engagement with Asia is the new
Australian Government's top priority in foreign policy, though
Australia is not part of Asia.
</P>
<P>
His patience and salesmanship gained favorable response from
the leaders of the three ASEAN (Association for Southeast Asian
Nations) countries, who unanimously supported Australia's
participation in the Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) in London.
</P>
<P>
Though Singapore and Thailand have always backed Australia's
attempt to join the international forum, Indonesia broke its
silence on the issue and for the first time made public its
support for Australia's bid.
</P>
<P>
This was an important achievement of Downer's overseas tour.
Indonesia is believed to be able to influence Malaysia's stance on
the ASEM issue. Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir lobbied to block
Australia from attending the first ASEM in Bangkok last December.
</P>
<P>
Downer successfully sold himself to the leaders of the three
most influential nations within ASEAN. He met with Indonesian
President Suharto, Singaporean Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong, Thai
Prime Minister Banharn Silpapa-archa and their respective foreign
ministers, as well as other high-ranking officials of the three
nations.
</P>
<P>
In Singapore, he said that Australia was ready to expand
defense cooperation with Singapore, including joint exercises and
the use of Australian military facilities by Singapore army, navy
and air forces.
</P>
<P>
He praised Thailand's Defense White Paper for mentioning
Australia as an important partner in maintaining world peace
because of Australia's close link with Europe and America. He
promised to send 50 young Australians to Thailand to train local
people.
</P>
<P>
He also made it clear that the Australian Government was
committed to strengthening regional security mechanisms through
bodies such as the ASEAN Regional Forum and the Asia Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum.
</P>
<P>
He said that Australia would unwaveredly push ahead the
development of APEC as a non-discriminatory trading organization.
It would work with its regional partners to put substance to the
1994 Bogor Declaration and the 1995 Osaka Action Agenda.
</P>
<P>
In line with the foreign policy guideline of not making
unnecessary noise on certain sensitive issues, Downer won the
praise of his Indonesian counterpart Ali Alatas by treating the
human rights issue of East Timor as "a pebble in the shoe" of the
relations between Australia and Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
However, Indonesian President Suharto declined to accept the
invitation to visit Australia because of possible human rights
protest against him in Australia.
</P>
<P>
Another major task that Downer completed during his overseas
trip was to define Australia's relations with the Asian region.
</P>
<P>
He told an audience of the Australian Thai Chamber of Commerce
and Australian Thai Alumni Association that Australia was "neither
Asian nor European nor American."
</P>
<P>
"We are Australians and related to our neighbors as
Australians," he said at the final day of his three-nation trip.
</P>
<P>
"It is in Australia's interest to be fully engaged with East
Asia,...and it is in East Asia's interest to have Australia fully
engaged," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Australia has a great deal to offer this region and the region
will be the poorer if Australia is not fully engaged with the
region," he said.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Urges Nepal to Consider WTO Membership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 22 (Xinhua) -- A World Bank official today
urged Nepal to decide whether it should become a member of the
World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
At a regional seminar on the WTO opened here today, WB
representative in Nepal Joe Manickavasagam said that policy makers
in Nepal need to assess the advantages and disadvantages of
becoming a WTO member.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, whether or not Nepal becomes a member of the
WTO, it is imperative for the country to be more competitive to
integrate with the world economy.
</P>
<P>
The three-day seminar on "WTO and its implications for South
Asian Agriculture", organized by the World Bank, were being
participated by government officials from South Asian countries,
including Nepal, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, and
experts of the WB, WTO and the United Nations Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO).
</P>
<P>
According to the WB official, agriculture is the largest sector
in Nepal accounting for 43 percent of the gross domestic product
(GDP) and absorbing more than 80 percent of the employment of the
country.
</P>
<P>
The agriculture sector is critical for Nepal to enhance its
economic growth, he said, adding that policy goals should be
designed to make the sector dynamic and increase its productivity.

<HEADLINE> Jiangsu's Financial Backing for Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Jiangsu Province's spending on
agriculture exceeded 10 billion yuan during the Eighth Five-Year
Plan (1991-1995), a record for any five-year period.
</P>
<P>
To build stronger agriculture, the prosperous eastern Chinese
province has said that growth rate of input in farming must exceed
that of overall financial spending, a provincial official said.
</P>
<P>
Local government input in agriculture in the province totalled
two billion yuan (about 240 million US dollars) in 1995, up 26.3
percent year-on-year, according to the latest statistics.
</P>
<P>
The increase was six percentage points higher than the growth
rate in overall financial spending the same year.
</P>
<P>
The official said that extra-budgetary funds, such as
flood-control funds and those for priority agricultural projects,
have been used to ensure stable growth in farming spending. The
province earmarked a total of 3.24 billion yuan between 1991 and
1995 for harnessing Huaihe River and Taihu Lake.
</P>
<P>
Last year, it began bolstering financial backing for
development of agro-science and techniques, by establishing a
special 13.55 million yuan fund.

Council meets in the homeland, for the first time in 30 years,
Israel declared this morning a new and restricted "security
closure" on the Palestinian territory, according to a report from
JMCC, a Palestinian press service based in east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
While the Palestinian Authority (PA) allows Israeli journalists
and foreigners to work and move freely in its territory, the
Israeli authorities still prevent Palestinian journalists from
entering Israel and moving between the West Bank and Gaza Strip,
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
In this day and at this moment, it said, the Israeli
authorities did not grant special permits for Palestinian
journalists to enter Gaza to cover the PNC meetings.
</P>
<P>
It said, "Despite our belief of absolute freedom of
journalistic work, and freedom of movement for all journalists,
and after all our attempts with the Israeli side to ease the work
of Palestinian journalists, we, unfortunately, are forced to
demand that the PA Information Ministry prevent Israeli
journalists from covering the PNC meetings."
</P>
<P>
"We also call upon PNC members, Palestinian Council members,
and all Palestinian officials to refrain from giving press
statements to Israeli journalists until Palestinian journalists
are allowed to work and move freely," the statement concluded.
</P>
<P>
The PNC meeting is scheduled to be held in Gaza this evening.

<HEADLINE> Trial Resumes of South Korea's Two Ex-Presidents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Former South Korean President Chun
Doo-hwan, on trial for mutiny and treason, said today that he was
not aware of any plot to seize power by him and other military
leaders in early 1980.
</P>
<P>
He said at the fifth session of his trial at the Seoul District
Court that he had never heard or known the contents of the
so-called "operations-K" plan, which was displayed by prosecutors
as evidence of a plot to usurp power by Chun and his accomplices,
including Roh Tae-woo, who later succeeded him as president.
</P>
<P>
However, Chun conceded that there was a plan to deal with the
political chaos in early 1980.
</P>
<P>
The plan was part of the martial law measures imposed to
resolve the domestic chaos prevailing at the time, he said.
</P>
<P>
It was intended to "foster stability conducive to the sustained
expansion of national strength based on military unity," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chun and Roh, together with 14 former army officers, have been
indicted on charges of mutiny, treason or both, stemming from
their roles in the 1979 military coup and the bloody crackdown on
a civil uprising on May 18, 1980, in Kwangju, capital of South
Cholla Province.
</P>
<P>
Chun, who became the army strongman after the 1979 coup, seized
power on August 27, 1980, and ruled the nation until February
1988. He was followed in the presidency by Roh, who stepped down
in February 1993.
</P>
<P>
The two former presidents, who were arrested last year, have
also been indicted on graft charges, for which Chun has already
stood trial twice and Roh three times.
</P>
<P>
The sixth trial session on the mutiny and treason charges will
be held on April 29.

<P>
WASHINGTON, April 22 (Xinhua) -- General Motors Corp. (GM)
suffered a 52 percent drop in its earnings in the first quarter of
this year, compared with the same period last year, the GM
announced today.
</P>
<P>
The fall was largely blamed on the 17-day strike that shut down
most of its North American assembly lines earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
The Detroit-based world's largest car-producer said it earned
1.02 billion U.S. dollars in the first three months this year,
compared with 2.1 billion dollars in the corresponding period last
year.
</P>
<P>
GM said the results include the after-tax cost of 900 million
dollars for the strike at GM's brake plants in Dayton, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
The strike, which was kicked off on March 5, resulted in the
temporary shutdown of 27 out of GM's 29 North American assembly
plants.

<HEADLINE> Symposium on Developing Mountainous Regions Held in Sichuan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANZHIHUA, April 22 (Xinhua) - Mountains and hills are home to
about a tenth of the world's population, and support nearly half
the world's people with their water, fuel, food, raw materials,
and other resources.
</P>
<P>
This was pointed out by experts from China, the United States,
Japan, Southeast Asia, and Western Europe who attended a recent
three-day International Symposium on the Development of
Mountainous and Hilly Areas. They discussed the role of
agriculture, comprehensive agricultural development, and
agriculture infrastructure construction in mountainous and hilly
regions.
</P>
<P>
A consensus reached by experts and governmental officials at
the symposium was that more attention should be paid to the
development of rural economy in mountainous and hilly regions,
which are the major source of water and energy for the world.
</P>
<P>
Traditional methods of development, however, are plain-oriented
and neglect the needs of mountainous regions. It would be a
historical mistake, they pointed out, if a strategic shift in
consciousness is not made soon.
</P>
<P>
The symposium was held in Panzhihua City, a mountainous and
hilly iron and steel center on the border of southwest China's
Sichuan and Guizhou provinces, and sponsored by the Chinese
Association of Agricultural Science Societies and the Sichuan
Association of Science and Technology, with assistance from the
Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations, the
International Center for Comprehensive Development in Mountainous
Regions, and the Sino-Japanese Association for Exchanges in
Agriculture, Forestry, and Aquaculture.

Siddiqui said the ambitious program for the development of the
international-standard national highways is expected to cost over
100 billion rupees (about 2.8 billion US dollars) over a period of
eight years beginning from 1992.
</P>
<P>
He said the total road network in the country is about 190,000
km which include eight highways with a total length of 6,587 km.
</P>
<P>
Detailing the Indus Highway, Siddiqui said that this highway,
an alternative link running from the north to the south in the
country, will reduce a distance between Karachi and Peshawar by
400 km and will also form a vital link between the Central Asian
States through Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The extension and improvement of the Karakorum Highway will
benefit the economic uplift of the country, the chairman said.
</P>
<P>
The completion of the Coastal Highway, with a cost of 4.5
billion rupees (300 million dollars), will link the coastal areas
with major cities including Karachi, he added.
</P>
<P>
Siddiqui said various foreign companies have responded
positively to the offers made by the Pakistani government while
the government intends to carry out its road projects on the
build-operate-transfer (BOT) basis and the private sector is being
invited to participate.
</P>
<P>
Siddiqui also briefed Hawke about the various bridge projects
in Punjab and Sindh provinces.
</P>
<P>
Hawke, who is currently visiting Pakistan at the invitation of
Asif Ali Zardari, chairman of the Pakistan Environmental
Protection Council, put forth questions about the possibilities of
foreign investment in the road projects.
</P>
<P>
The former Australian premier showed a keen interest in those
small bridge projects which ensure high rates of return in the
minimum of time.

<HEADLINE> Beijing West Railway Station Handles 2.8 Million Passengers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Since its official opening on
January 21, on the eve of Spring Festival, the capital's West
Railway Station has had about 2.8 million passengers.
</P>
<P>
Vice-director of the station, Cai Fengxiang, says that it has
been a really hard job, because the staff were only hired two
months before the opening, and there were rules still to be
established.
</P>
<P>
Then, only 10 days after the opening, the peak season
started. In 50 days, the stations handled 2.54 million passengers,
some 40 percent of Beijing Railway Station's load having been
diverted here. "That's why we had to get to work a little early,"
Cai explained.
</P>
<P>
The station faced another test in March, when many people
arrived for the annual sessions of the National People's Congress
and the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference.
</P>
<P>
"We have done a good job", Cai said, adding that, in the three
months, not one train has been late because of management
mistakes, and the station is free of the crowding and noise of the
old Beijing Railway Station.
</P>
<P>
Construction for a waiting hall is still underway. The
telecommunications center went into operation earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Yang Sixin, chief engineer for construction at the station,
says that work will be finished before July 1997, when Hong Kong
is returned to China and passenger trains will be running between
Beijing and Kowloon.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Deputy PM Calls on Europe to Be Even-Handed </HEADLINE>

<P>
BAGHDAD, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz called on Europe to keep away from the U.S. hegemony
and adopt an even-handed and coordinated attitude toward the
embargo imposed on his country.
</P>
<P>
This came during an interview Aziz had with Anne-Marie Lizan,
vice chairwoman of the Socialist International, and member of the
Belgian Senate, who is currently visiting Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
In the course of the interview, Lizan stressed the need to hold
a constructive dialogue between Europe and Iraq based on the
common interests of both parties and consolidating peace and
stability in the Middle East region and the entire world.
</P>
<P>
At a symposium held in Baghdad Sunday and attended by a number
of Arab intellectuals and thinkers, the Iraqi deputy prime
minister said his country was seeking to bring about some
international changes with the aim of lifting the embargo imposed
on Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait in August 1990.
</P>
<P>
"Those who are interested in the region will sooner or later
be forced to deal with Iraq. Disturbance of the world balance of
power is circumstantial and temporary, because it is impossible
for the world to be dominated by a single superpower. We have to
frame a new conception of the world balance of power and make use
of its positive elements," Aziz said.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi capital has recently seen many interviews conducted
by Iraqi officials with visiting foreign delegations with the aim
getting the embargo on Iraq lifted.

<P>
BEIRUT, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez
Boueiz today stressed the necessity to implement U.N. Security
Council resolution 425, which calls for an unconditional Israeli
withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Before his departure for New York, Boueiz said at Beirut
International Airport that "for us, the basic demand is the
implementation of resolution 425 because it constitutes a real and
effective mechanism for a settlement of the crisis."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on several proposals raised recently for a
cease-fire, the foreign minister noted that so far, all the
contacts on what was called "the U.S. proposal" had not been
completed.
</P>
<P>
He said that U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher was
consulting with the parties concerned on the proposal.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz expressed hope that "a serious and fundamental form will
be reached within the next few hours, or in the next two days."
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister also described the French proposal as
"practical," saying it includes "a big volume of things whose
results could be depended on."
</P>
<P>
Boueiz, accompanying President Elias Hrawi to New York to
attend a General Assembly session of the United Nations,
announced that Hrawi's visit to New York is aimed at exposing to
the world the massacres and disasters happening in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He said the United Nations is the "most important" venue to
explore problems in the world.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. General Assembly is scheduled to be held, at the
request of Lebanon, Tuesday to discuss Israel's continuous
military operations in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Hrawi will deliver a speech at the U.N. General Assembly
session. Well-informed official sources said the Lebanese
president is expected to demand an immediate cease-fire and a
compensation for the damages afflicted with by Israel in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Before departing from Beirut, the Lebanese president had a
meeting with U.S. Ambassador to Lebanon Richard Johns, which was
the second meeting between them in 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik al-
Hariri and House Speaker Nabih Berri left here today for Damascus
for consultations with the Syrian leaders.
</P>
<P>
Reliable governmental sources do not rule out a possibility of
a meeting between Hariri and Christopher in the Syrian capital.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon observed today an "official mourning day," grieving
over the death of more than 150 victims in Israel's continuous
strikes at southern Lebanese towns and villages since April 11.
</P>
<P>
At 12:00 local time (09:00 GMT), all Lebanese, wearing black in
compliance with a government instruction, stood in for one-minute
silent mourning, when all radios stopped their normal programs to

<HEADLINE> Britain Considers Ban on Imports of EU Beef </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Britain is considering a total ban
on beef imports from other member countries of the European Union
(EU) if the EU still refuses to lift the world-wide ban on British
beef exports.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister John Major is reportedly getting
"incandescent" over the EU's refusal to lift the ban and he is
studying a range of retaliatory measures, according to the
Financial Times newspaper.
</P>
<P>
One possible option is to impose a ban on imports of beef from
all other EU member countries on the grounds that other EU member
states have also reported cases of BSE or mad cow disease.
</P>
<P>
Senior government ministers acknowledged that a ban on European
beef imports would have to be legally watertight. They argued that
Britain has taken adequate measures to minimize the threat of BSE
spreading to human beings.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, British Agriculture Minister Douglas Hogg
will meet EU Agriculture Commissioner Franz Fistcher in
Brussels on Tuesday to discuss measures that Britain is
taking to wipe out BSE.

BEIJING, April 22 (Xinhua) -- China and Nepal have agreed to
further enhance the mutually beneficial cooperation between the

</P>
<P>
This is stated in the joint communique expected to be issued

</P>
<P>
During the visit, the Joint Communique says, Chinese President
Jiang Zemin met with the Nepalese Prime Minister and Premier Li

</P>
<P>
It says that Chinese Premier Li Peng expressed appreciation for
the Nepalese government's consistent policy on the Tibet and
Taiwan questions. Prime Minister Deuba reaffirmed the firm stand
of the Nepalese government that Tibet and Taiwan are inalienable
parts of the People's Republic of China, and promised not to
permit anyone to use Nepalese territory for activities harmful to
China's sovereignty and unification, the communique says.

On international issues, the document says, the two sides were

have become the mainstream in the world. Nevertheless, as there
still exist a number of destabilizing factors and uncertainties,
the world is by no means problem-free. The two sides believed that

more attention and protection.

wounded by Israeli shelling.
</P>
<P>
"We want to go home, but our house was destroyed. What can we
do?" the veiled Rudeina told Xinhua. She lost control of her
feelings and began to weep. She and her five brothers now could
only sleep on the ground of the ward.
</P>
<P>
Since April 11, Israel has carried out continual air strikes
and bombardment on southern Lebanese towns and villages, leaving
some 150 people dead and hundreds of others wounded. The Israeli
attacks also triggered the exodus of up to 500,000 refugees, about
one eighth of the country's population.
</P>
<P>
Rudeina's village is near the Israeli self-proclaimed "security
zone" in south Lebanon. She told Xinhua that because many young
men in the village have joined the Islamic Resistance, the
military wing of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah (Party of God), the
village has suffered heavy artillery and air strikes by Israel
since April 11.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese security sources said Israeli warplanes attacked
Shakra village again on Sunday afternoon, causing two civilians
wounded.
</P>
<P>
Rudeina said many houses in her village were destroyed and
most of the 1,000 residents have fled their homes.
</P>
<P>
Khalaf Khalaf, Rudeina's 30-year-old brother, said that "where
there is occupation, there will be resistance. If Israel still
occupies our land, We will fire Katyusha rockets into northern
Israel."
</P>
<P>
"The Lebanese people love peace. If Israel troops withdraw
from south Lebanon, the attacks on them will stop," he added.
</P>
<P>
Fayeza Merhi, a 28-year-old nurse, asked journalists to "write
objective stories and shoot clear photos to let the people
worldwide know the crimes committed by Israel in Lebanon."
</P>
<P>
Under the threat of Israeli attacks, more than 80,000 of
Sour's 100,000 residents have fled to the north in the past few
days. The exodus made this originally thriving port city virtually
a ghost town, where all shops and restaurants were shuttered and
all was unusually quiet except for the distant roar of Israeli
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese government has promised to compensate its
southerners after a cease-fire is achieved. Some airlift relief
supplies have been transported to Beirut from other countries.
</P>
<P>
But as Israeli gunships began to shell the main coastal road to
cut links between Beirut and the south of the country on April 19,
some relief supplies can not be delivered to the refugees on time.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday night, when journalists were driving from Sour to
Beirut, there were few passenger cars on the coastal
road. Sporadic shelling could still be heard near the road.
</P>
<P>
Despite the intensive diplomatic efforts to end the fighting
between Israel and Hezbollah, cross-border exchanges of gunfire
were still continuing.

Zhaoxing announced here today that the Chinese Government will
host a symposium in Shanghai in March 1997 to commemorate the 50th
anniversary of ESCAP.
</P>
<P>
In March 1947, the Economic Commission for Asia and Far East,
the predecessor of the United Nations Economic and Social
Commission (ESCAP), was established in Shanghai. 1997 will be the
50th anniversary of ESCAP.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the 52nd ESCAP Commission Session here today, Li,
who is head of the Chinese delegation to the Session, said that
the Chinese government hopes that this commemorative symposium
will provide a unique occasion for members and associate members
to review the organization's past and look into its future in the
coming century.
</P>
<P>
Li said to be better positioned to take up the challenges of
the 21st century, ESCAP needs a clear sense of direction and a
prioritized work program that reflects evolving realities and
changing needs.
</P>
<P>
Li said that during the past few decades, ESCAP has made
positive contributions to promoting economic and social
development in the region. With changes in world political and
economic configuration, ESCAP has before it a series of new
challenges and problems.
</P>
<P>
ESCAP must be strengthened, and at the same time it needs to
improve its work, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Li said that while its cooperation activities must be geared to
meeting the needs of all, special attention must be given to
meeting the needs of the developing members and associate members,
including the least developed, land-locked, island members and the
disadvantaged members of economies in transition.

overall relaxation of international situation and further

<HEADLINE> Greek Patrol Boat Opens Fire on Turkish Fishing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- A Greek coast security boat this
morning opened fire on a Turkish fishing boat which Greece said
carried illegal immigrants from Iraq to a Greek islet in the
Aegean Sea.
</P>
<P>
Greek and Turkish officials gave different accounts.
</P>
<P>
The local Anatolia News Agency reported that the Turkish
Foreign Ministry would summon Greek Ambassador to Ankara later
today or tomorrow to protest the incident.
</P>
<P>
Ankara believed that it was not necessary for an armed Greek
vessel to open fire at a civil Turkish boat.
</P>
<P>
"If they can do nothing (to prevent the boat), they can contact
Turkish authorities later and pass on whatever they complain," a
Turkish Foreign Ministry official was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The official said the incident, during which a Turkish
fisherman was wounded, took place in Turkish waters. Therefore
the government cannot keep silent.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, A diplomat from the Greek Embassy in Ankara
said the "Derya" fishing boat, with previous record of illegally
bringing immigrants to Greek islets in the Aegean Sea, this time
carried eight Iraqis to the Greek islet of Strongili, about 500
meters from the Turkish coastline.
</P>
<P>
The Greek patrol boat only fired warning shots to the sky, said
the Greek diplomat. But the patrol boat might have entered Turkish
waters due to bad weather when it chased the Turkish boat, he told
the Anatolia News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of people, mainly from the Middle East, are arrested
each year after paying Turkish fishermen to smuggle them onto the
dozens of Greek islands and islets that lie just off Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Greece have long been at odds over territorial
waters, airspace and mineral rights in the Aegean Sea and over the
divided island of Cyprus.

LAGOS, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The eight-member special
Commonwealth ministerial committee, whose request to visit
Nigeria was rebuffed by the federal government, will meet in
London tomorrow to decide on whether or not futher sanctions
would be imposed on Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The committee, headed by Zimbabwean Foreign Minister Stan
Madenge, was set up last November by the Commonwealth, shortly
after Nigeria was suspended from the organization, to investigate
alleged gross human rights violations and monitor government's
commitment to democraic reforms.
</P>
<P>
The suspension was in response to the execution of the "Ogoni
nine."

in Nigeria Friday, with a special message from the Zimbabwean
Preident Robert Mugabe, said in the Nigerian capital of Abuja

consider "the question of whether there would be further measures
or not against Nigeria."

<P>
He also said that the committee would consider a protest
letter sent to it by Nigerian Foreign Affairs Minister Tom Ikimi.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Commonwealth committee meeting,Tom Ikimi said
that the Nigerian government was not worried about what might the
outcome of the committee's meeting.

<P>
Nigeria does not believe the suspension which was taken in a
hasty manner was in the best interest of the Commonwealth or
Nigeria, the Nigerian Foreign Affaris Minster noted.

<HEADLINE> Troops Consolidate Positions In Northern Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 22 (Xinhua) -- A major town on Jaffna peninsula
is now under the control of government troops, as Sri Lankan
forces involved in Operation Riviresa II consolidated their
positions on the fourth day of the offensive, defense officials
here said today.
</P>
<P>
They said that government troops had made no further advances
since Sunday and were consolidating their positions in the areas
taken during the offensive so far.
</P>
<P>
The column advancing from the Valikamam frontlines took control
of a large town Sunday. Defense officials described the
re-capture of the town as a major success, but they did not
mention the name of the town.
</P>

the displaced people to return to their homes in Jaffna city and
Valikamam.
</P>
<P>
There had been no resistance to the army columns by Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) units yesterday, said the officials,
adding that the LTTE is believed to have pulled out its units from
this sector and left behind them mine fields and booby traps in a
bid to slow down the advance of the government troops.
</P>
<P>
The second stage II of the Operation Riviresa which began on
Friday is aimed at securing control of more territory in the
Vadamarachchi and Thenmaratchi sectors within Jaffna peninsula.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Qantas, the Australian
Airlines, is planning to increase the frequency of its services to
China, said a regional head of the company here today.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the planned expansion would be the
introduction of twice weekly services to Shanghai in late August
this year, Rick Coyle, regional general manager of Qantas' North
East Asia, told a news briefing.
</P>
<P>
Qantas will open an office in Shanghai within a few weeks, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said the airline would also seek approvals to operate
another two weekly services into China by the middle of next year.
</P>
<P>
"That would be a major step towards Qantas' objective of
operating daily flights to Beijing and Shanghai, the two principal
cities in China, as soon as possible."
</P>
<P>
Qantas resumed flying to Beijing in March 1995 in twice weekly
services.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, according to a contract signed between Qantas and
China's Yunnan Airlines in 1995, Qantas recently started a
four-week training course for 17 attendants on international 767
flight. Crews are receiving training in customer service, service
styles, communication, English language, public address, grooming
and safety.

<HEADLINE> Poverty Alleviation Requires International Efforts: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Li
Zhaoxing said here today, "Poverty alleviation strategies and
measures at the national level alone are not enough. They call for
joint efforts of the international community as well as extensive
and effective global cooperation."
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the 52nd Session of the United Nations Economic and
Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, which opened here
today, Li Zhaoxing, who is also head of the Chinese delegation to
the Session, said, "Without input, there will be no output. If
there is no sufficient financial input, poverty alleviation and
efforts to provide food and clothing to the poor will be nothing
but empty talk. Action speaks louder than words."
</P>
<P>
Li added that "to increase official development assistance to
developing countries will not only contribute to developing
countries' efforts to address the problem of poverty, but also
help nurture their domestic markets and promote world commodity
trade. The United Nations Development Program, the World Bank, the
Asia Development Bank and other multilateral agencies should
continue to include poverty alleviation as priorities in their
respective work programs and to provide the necessary financial
resources."
</P>
<P>
Li said that ESCAP, as the most representative regional
inter-governmental organization, it "should and can make a greater
contribution to regional poverty alleviation. "
</P>
<P>
"Given the gravity and the urgency of the poverty situation in
the region, ESCAP should consider formulating at an early possible
date a regional Strategy or Program of Action on Poverty
Alleviation which should set forth regional objectives, goals,
targets as well as specific measures. "
</P>
<P>
"In addition, EASCAP should conduct a thorough investigation
and study on the current state of poverty and the hindrance to
poverty alleviation efforts in the region."
</P>
<P>
Li said, "Alleviation of poverty is only possible with
sustained and sustainable economic growth. Poverty emerges in the
process of social and economic development. It therefore can only
reduce through further economic and social development. Sustained
economic growth not only creates large numbers of jobs which
benefit the victims of poverty, but also increases government
revenue which will make it financially capable of establishing and
improving social security systems. "
</P>
<P>
He said that "facts show that rapid economic growth alone is
not sufficient to reduce poverty. " and that "poverty alleviation
measures should be focused on the 'blood generating' capacity of
the poor population with particular attention given to the
interests of women, children, the handicapped and other vulnerable
groups."
</P>
<P>
He said China is a populous developing country with 65 million
people still living in poverty. The Chinese Government has always
taken poverty eradication as a central ingredient of its efforts
to ensure people's right to subsistence and development and
accorded the work a special status in its economic and social
development.
</P>
<P>
In order to basically wipe out abject poverty by the end of this
center, China drew up the Poverty Alleviation Program in 1994
aimed at lifting the then 80 million people out of poverty in
seven years. Further reduction of poverty has been made an
important component of the Ninth Five-Year Plan and the long-range
Objectives to the Year 2010, both were adopted at the recently
concluded Fourth Session of the Eighth National People's Congress.

<HEADLINE> Crimes Increase in Jordan in 1995: Reports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Jordan witnessed an increase of
crimes by 6.6 percent in 1995 as against 1994, a police report
said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 38,979 crimes were committed last year, compared
with 36,694 in 1994, according to a report released recently by
the Public Security Department.
</P>
<P>
However, the report noted that the number of homicides dropped
by 12.3 percent during last year.
</P>
<P>
The crime rate has increased steadily since 1988 at about 10
percent per year due to the rapid development in the kingdom's
socio-economic situation, it said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that in 1995 police dealt with 78 murder
cases, in which 85 individuals including 35 females and 13
foreigners were killed. While in 1994 87 murder cases were
reported in which 97 people including 36 females and six
foreigners were killed.
</P>
<P>
The police said moral crimes ranked highest among the total
number of reported homicides in the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Quarrels or feuds that resulted in death ranked second highest
among the 1995 homicides, with 16 cases of manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
Cases of attempted murder increased from 195 to 220 last year.
</P>
<P>
Rape, child molestation and sodomy registered an average
increase of more than 10 percent, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The study indicated that unemployed persons accounted for 49
percent of those found guilty of committing crimes, while the
average age range of the criminals as well as their victims was
18 to 27.

<P>
HARBIN,April 22 (Xinhua) -- Not only government officials but
also ordinary citizens, especially employees in hotels, companies
and department stores, in China's northernmost Heilongjiang
Province are keen to study the Russian language these days.
</P>
<P>
Russian has become the second most commonly used language after
Chinese in this province which borders the Russian Federation.
</P>
<P>
Since China began its opening-up policy in the late 1970s and
resumed trade with Russia in the early 1980s, learning Russian is
back in vogue in schools, enterprises and even in kindergartens.
</P>
<P>
Russian classes, clubs and salons are mushrooming in
the province now, and Russian songs and speech contests as
well as Russian-related entertainments are held throughout
the province.
</P>
<P>
Many local primary and middle schools as well as colleges and
universities have established friendship ties with Russian
schools, and they carry out exchanges with each other.
</P>
<P>
Graduates from Russian departments in local universities are
in short supply, it is learned.

<HEADLINE> Slum Population Increases in Dhaka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The slum and squatter population in
Dhaka is increasing by at least 60,000 people or 10,000 households
every year.
</P>
<P>
According to an official source, approximately 25 percent of
the Dhaka city population or about 1.7 million people reside in
slum and squatter settlements.
</P>
<P>
A survey also confirmed that slum settlements range in size
from 10 households to over 500 households and are scattered
throughout the capital city.
</P>
<P>
The sanitation and environmental conditions within most of the
slums are extremely poor, the survey said, adding that 87 percent
of the population use community facilities and the remaining 13
percent either use others facilities or defecate in open spaces.
</P>
<P>
65 percent of the slums have poor drainage, of which 22 percent
are regularly flooded during even minor rainfalls, it said.
</P>
<P>
Sociologists feared that extreme poverty, poor environmental
conditions and poor health conditions are not only a sociological
problem, but can also ultimately become an explosive political
problem. They called on the authorities concerned to address and
resolve the problem.

<HEADLINE> G-7 Officials Express Optimism for Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Financial leaders of the G-7
industrial nations expressed optimism today that the world economy
will rebound in the wake of sluggishness last year in North
America and Europe.
</P>
<P>
However, finance ministers and the Central Bank governors from
the G-7 countries, which include the United States, Japan,
Germany, Britain, France, Canada and Italy, did not dish out any
new policy and measures to stimulate the economic growth.
</P>
<P>
"In the broad sense, we believe that despite the recent pause
in some countries, the G-7's underlying fundamentals are
promising, particularly in light of progress in reducing
inflation," remarked the U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, who
chaired the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said the group "welcomed" developments in foreign
currency markets in the past year and pledged to continue
cooperating closely. A year ago, the G-7 countries were able to
reverse a sharp slide in the value of the dollar, which had
dragged the U.S. dollar down to record lows against the Japanese
yen and German mark. Since last April, the dollar has increased in
value by 35 percent against the Japanese yen.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the global economic situation and currency market,
the G-7 finance ministers reviewed and discussed the Russian
economic reforms and the proposal for new assistance for the
world's 20 debt-saddled poor countries by forgiving their debts.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of debt relief, the G-7 officials reviewed a joint
proposal put forward by the IMF and the World Bank to grant
between 8 billion U.S. dollars and 9 billion dollars in debt
relief to the world's 20 poorest nations, many of them in southern
Africa. The proposal also calls on the rich countries to write off
90 percent of the debt of these countries, up from a policy of 67
percent currently.

<HEADLINE> China's First Conference on Disabled Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 22 (Xinhua) -- China's first national working
conference on disabled persons opened here today, with a senior
official urging the whole of society to render more support to the
handicapped.
</P>
<P>
This is the first national meeting that the Co-ordination
Working Committee for the Handicapped under the State Council has
sponsored to sum up the experiences of the past five years and
draw up a plan for the forthcoming five years.
</P>
<P>
Peng Peiyun, state councillor and chairperson of the
Co-ordination Working Committee for the Handicapped under the
State Council, said that over the next five years, that
governments at all levels should give full play to their leading
role to help the disabled, and that all institutions for the
disabled should strengthen co-ordination.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this century, Peng noted, China hopes to
rehabilitate three million disabled persons and to help 80 percent
of the handicapped children of school age get access to
regular education.
</P>
<P>
The future targets also include helping 80 percent of the
disabled find jobs, Peng added.
</P>
<P>
She stated that disabled persons will be encouraged to take
part in more social and cultural activities, and work will be
stepped up to improve services and conditions for them.
</P>
<P>
Although a lot has been achieved in the past five years for the
disabled, there is still much to be done for handicapped people in
China, Peng said.
</P>
<P>
According to Deng Pufang, chairman of the China Disabled
Persons' Federation, there are still a lot of disabled persons in
need of rehabilitation. Some 40 percent of the disabled are
illiterate and 30 percent are unemployed, while 18 million do not
have enough food and clothing.
</P>
<P>
At today's meeting 130 counties, cities and districts in China
were awarded prizes for their outstanding contribution to the
cause of the disabled in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
Seminars on disabled persons' employment, education and
rehabilitation, and an evening performance by blind and deaf
students of special schools will be held along with the three-day
conference.
</P>
<P>
The latest statistics released by the federation show that
there are a total of 60 million disabled people in China, and
there is an increase of one million each year.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Two Rwandan genocide
suspects currently under custody in Zambia will appear before the
Arusha based International Criminal Tricunal for Rwanda (ITR) in
mid May, said ITR registrar Andronico Adede.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Adede told reporters in Arusha on Sunday that the two
suspects would be transferred to Tanzania's special prison cells
soon and later appear before the tribunal. Dates for full hearing
would depend on agreement with defence lawyers, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the fate of the first eight suspects whose indictments were
announced on December 12 last year, Adede said that ITR had been
liaising with the governments holding them but most were still at
large and thus he wouldn't mention them for fear of tampering
with investigations.
</P>
<P>
Over 400 Rwandan genocide suspects who were mostly senior
officials in the late President Habyrimana's government are
alleged in one way or the other of involvement in the mass
killings of innocent civilians mostly Tutsis following the death
of the former Head of State in a plane crash on April 6, 1994.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Govt Tightens Control On Zanzibar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 56 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa on Sunday dismissed any compromise with the
Zanzibar opposition, saying the latter was using democracy to
disrupt peace in the country.
</P>
<P>
Addressing thousands of Zanzibar residents, Mkapa said the
ruling Revolutionary Party (CCM) would maintain peace and
harmony, "a task which the government was prepared to accomplish
at all costs."
</P>
<P>
Mkapa, who is the president of the Union Government of
Tanganyika and Zanzibar, said he had received a lot of letters
from the opposition and their allies outside the country, all of
them trying to pursued him to intervene in the Zanzibar crisis.
</P>
<P>
"But what crisis is there for me to intervene?" he asked,
adding that the opposition's claim to restrain Zanzibar President
Salmin Amour was "baseless."
</P>
<P>
"Instead of restraining him, I would rather put them (the
opposition) under control," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa said the zanzibar leader would stay together with the
union president and vice-president "because we are all
implementing the same election manifesto which we previously
promised to adhere to."
</P>
<P>
"The emancipation of the people is the result of their own
sacrifice and not by sending messages to foreigners," he said,
referring to the opposition Civic United front (CUF) protest
outside the U.S. Embassy in Dar es Salaam last week.
</P>
<P>
Ridiculing certain Western donors who supported the
opposition, Mkapa said "most of them knew that the opposition was
causing civil disobedience and other sabotage acts" in the
Zanzibar Island.
</P>
<P>
"Our governments are trying to have this sabotage and
disobedience brought under control, but to the contrary we are
regarded as contravening human rights. What kind of human rights
are associated with sabotage and law breaking?" the president
asked.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to the donors not to approve of the actions of the
opposition, saying "their statements were geared at drawing the
country into a civil war."
</P>

<HEADLINE> Russia Participates in China's Power Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Business people from Russia are
showing interest in the rapid development of China's power
industry.
</P>
<P>
According to the China Yangtze River Three Gorges Development
Corporation, a Russian company intends to participate in an
international tender for supplying turbogenerators for the
Three Gorges Project, the world's largest water-control scheme.
</P>
<P>
Russia has already sent more than 100 business people and
experts to China to inspect and exchange views on joining the
construction since 1992, when China decided to go ahead with it.
</P>
<P>
"Construction of the Three Gorges Project includes both a
hydroelectric power station and a large reservoir," said a trade
representative of the Russian Embassy here.
</P>
<P>
"There is huge potential for the export of Russian equipment to
China, and several Russian enterprises have decided to form a
concern specially for the project," he added.
</P>
<P>
Russian companies have also co-operated with Chinese partners
in building power projects.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Huaneng International Power Development
Corporation has imported a number of 300,000-kw coal-fueled
generating units from Russia in recent years.
</P>
<P>
With Russian equipment, it is building two power plants in
Yingkou, Liaoning Province, and Shantou, Guangdong Province,
respectively, as well as a heating and power plant in Beijing,
which are expected to go into operation in the next two years.
</P>
<P>
According to an agreement, Russia will help China build a
nuclear power plant in Liaoning, which will be the largest in
China upon completion.
</P>
<P>
Russia has promised to grant 2.5 billion US dollars in
low-interest government loans, and offer two power-generating
units for the project.

<HEADLINE> NEC to Build New Microchip R &AMP; D Facility </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Japan's NEC Corp. will build a new
research and development facility for semiconductors with an
investment of 200 billion yen (roughly 1.85 billion U.S. dollars)
over the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
The facility, designed for research on the most advanced
ultrathin circuit-etching technology at 0.15 micron and 0.07
micron, will be built at NEC's production site in Sagamihara,
Kanagawa Prefecture, Kyodo News Service reported today.
</P>
<P>
With technology for etching circuit lines of 0.07 micron, it
would be possible to draw 1,000 lines in the space occupied by the
width of a single human hair, the report said, adding that a
micron is one-millionth of a meter.
</P>
<P>
Such a technology would enable downsizing of the current
supercomputers to the size of personal computers, while personal
computers could be made the same size as a wristwatch.
</P>
<P>
It would also make possible 64-gigabit memories that could
store a 3-hour-long movie on a single microchip.
</P>
<P>
Under a plan, NEC will construct a three-story building, to be
completed in June next year, with a total floor space of 30,000
square meters. The building will contain a clean room of 6,500
square meters.
</P>
<P>
The research facility will be built in three stages. In the
first stage, development equipment and a trial production line of
microchips with 0.15 micron technology will be built at a cost of
50 billion yen (roughly 462.9 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The facility is expected to start operation in October next
year.
</P>
<P>
The second and third stages of the facility are expected to
start operation in 2000 and 2003, respectively, for developing
further advanced technologies at 0.1 micron and 0.07 micron,
according to the report.

<HEADLINE> South Lebanon Operation Costs Israel 100 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Israeli military operation
against Hezbollah targets in south Lebanon, code-named Operation
Grapes of Wrath, has cost the country at least 100 million
U.S. dollars so far, today's Jerusalem Post reported.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted government spokesman Uri Dromi as saying
that this initial estimate includes lost work days, damaged
property, handling of thousands of evacuees, decreased tourism,
and various other indirect costs of the 11-day-old operation.
</P>
<P>
"It could get much worse," Dromi added.
</P>
<P>
Since the operation began on April 11, more than 500 Katyusha
rockets have been fired at Israel, Dromi said, adding that about
450 Katyushas had been fired by Lebanese and Palestinian guerrilla
groups from 1968 to the time before the current offensive.
</P>
<P>
He said 34 people died in those attacks.
</P>
<P>
According to Israel's Income and Property Tax authorities,
Katyushas have caused 7 million dollars in direct property damage
and another 17 million dollars in indirect damage.
</P>
<P>
Prosper Azran, the mayor of Kiryat Shmona, a northern Israeli
town which has been under the Katyusha attacks, said that 1,000
homes, more than 200 cars and several factories have been damaged
in the town.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of residents have been evacuated from their
homes in the northern towns and villages, seeking havens
southward, while the remaining residents have been spending most
of their time in bomb shelters and security rooms.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the continued hostilities in the north could mean a
drop of one-third in tourism, according to Hotel Association
Director Avi Rosental.
</P>
<P>
Rosental said he feared that many would-be tourists from
abroad had already canceled plans to visit Israel, while others,
who were thinking of coming, have now decided to go to other
destinations this summer.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the continuation of fighting between Israeli army
and Hezbollah (Party of Gad) gunmen could mean a loss of about one
million dollars each week to the hoteliers in the area.
</P>
<P>
He also said that tourists were already frightened away by a
series of suicide bombing attacks in late February and early March
in Israel, which killed at least 60 people and wounded over 150
others.
</P>
<P>
He added that the image of stability, which served to
encourage tourists to come, has been shattered, and this could
have an immediate effect on some 30,000 hotel workers in Israel.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Sri Lankan Presidents Hold Talks in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin and
visiting Sri Lankan President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga
agreed here today to further develop bilateral co-operation in
economy and trade.
</P>
<P>
During their talks in the Great Hall of the People, the two
leaders also stressed the importance of co-operation between China
and the South Asian Association for Regional Co-operation (SAARC).
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that China supports the regional co-operation among
the south Asian countries and appreciates the efforts the Sri
Lankan government has made in this regard.
</P>
<P>
As a part of South-South assistance, the regional co-operation
in the South Asia is beneficial to the economic development of all
the countries in the region based on equality and mutual benefits,
Jiang said, and China hopes that the SAARC will make new
achievements in the region.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga said that Sri Lanka attaches great importance to
the co-operation among all the SAARC members and believes that
China is the association's most important co-operation partner.
</P>
<P>
She said that the co-operation between China and the SAARC is
of great help to both of them and to the economic development in
the area.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents, who exchanged views on bilateral relations
when they gathered in New York last October to attend the ceremony
marking the 50th anniversary of the United Nations, today again
pledged further bilateral co-operation in various fields,
especially in trade and economy.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that the Chinese government pays much attention to
its ties with Sri Lanka and is willing to inject new vigor into
the bilateral friendship and co-operation.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga said that Sri Lanka welcomes Chinese business
people to invest and launch joint ventures in her country.
</P>
<P>
During the talks the Sri Lankan president reiterated that her
country will firmly implement the "one China" policy, which won
appreciation from the Chinese president.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that since the establishment of diplomatic ties in
1957, China and Sri Lanka have enjoyed a sound relationship, and
the friendship between the peoples of the two countries has
withstood the test of time.
</P>
<P>
Both Jiang and Kumaratunga agreed that the two countries, which
have much in common, should co-operate more closely in
international affairs.
</P>
<P>

Lankan government has made in seeking a political solution to its
ethnic issues and said that China sincerely hopes that Sri Lanka
will restore its peace process, realize national conciliation, and
maintain its social stability and economic development.
</P>
<P>
Following the talks, the two leaders attended a ceremony at
which the two countries signed an agreement on economic and
technical co-operation.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the talks, Jiang held a grand ceremony to welcome his

<HEADLINE> New Jersey Nets, Orlando Magic to Play in NBA Japan Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 22 (Xinhua/OANA) -- The New Jersey Nets and
Orlando Magic will meet at the Tokyo Dome on November 7 and 9 in
the NBA Japan Games, NBA Commissioner David Stern said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The 1996 event will mark the fourth time the league has staged
regular season games in Japan.
</P>
<P>
"The NBA is pleased to continue the tradition of playing
regular season games in Japan where support for the NBA and the
sport of basketball has grown tremendously," said Stern.
</P>
<P>
"The NBA Japan Games have become a highlight of the NBA
calender and represent the league's commitment to our Japanese
fans."
</P>
<P>
"We are excited about playing for the first time in the Tokyo
Dome, where more than 35,000 fans will be able to enjoy each game."
</P>
<P>
In 1990, the NBA became the first American professional sports
league to conduct regular season games outside of North America
when the Phoenix Suns and Utah Jazz opened the 1990-91 season with
two games in Tokyo's Metropolitan Gym.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, the Houston Rockets and Seattle Supersonics opened the
season with two games in Yokohama and the Los Angeles Clippers and
Portland Trail Blazers continued the tradition, playing two games
in Yokohama to open the 1994-95 season.
</P>
<P>
Orlando, the 1996 NBA Atlantic Division champions and reigning
Eastern conference champions, will bring their powerful but
youthful team to Japan.
</P>
<P>
All-Stars Shaquille O'Neal, 24, and "Penny" Hardaway, 23, both
members of the USA Basketball Dream Team, spearhead the Magic
attack, but are surrounded by a formidable supporting cast that
includes Horace Grant and Dennis Scott.
</P>
<P>
Head coach Brian Hill has guided the Magic to three consecutive
50-win seasons since being hired as coach before the 1993-94
season.
</P>
<P>
New Jersey radically transformed its roster this season in two
trades that bode well for the team's future.
</P>
<P>
Shawn Bradley, a 7-foot-6 center who was the second overall
selection in the 1993 NBA Draft, improved dramatically after
joining the Nets from Philadalphia in late November.
</P>
<P>
And Kendall Gill, who was acquired from Charlotte in late
February, played well before suffering a season-ending injury to
his left hand.
</P>
<P>
New Jersey is coached by Butch Beard.
</P>
<P>
Both games between the Magic and Nets will be televised in
Japan and throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
The complete 1996-97 NBA regular season scheduel will be
announced in mid-July.

<HEADLINE> Thai PM Calls for Tackling Poverty in Asia-Pacific </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Banharn
Silpa-archa today called for new ideas and efforts to tackle
poverty and adverse consequences of development in the
Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the inaugural meeting of the three-day 52nd Session
of the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and
the Pacific (ESCAP) here today, the Thai prime minister said that
despite successes in the region, "great disparities still exist in
the levels of economic development among the countries of the
region" and " poverty remains a key issue that needs to be tackled
at both domestic and international levels. "
</P>
<P>
The major theme for the session is "rural poverty alleviation
and sustainable development in Asia and the Pacific."
</P>
<P>
Other topics to be discussed at the session include regional
economic cooperation, environment, transport and communications,
with special focus on the region's pressing infrastructure
problems, statistics and the special needs for least developed,
land-locked and Pacific island developing countries as well as
countries in economic transition.
</P>
<P>
Banharn said that the main theme of this session "is highly
relevant to the global plan of action set forth by the United
Nations, particularly by the World Summit on Social Development
held in Copenhagen early last year, and the subject of the Summit
remains high on the agenda of developing countries and, given its
complexity, still awaits a solution."
</P>
<P>
Taking his own country as example, he said that for the past
three decades, Thailand has sustained high levels of economic
growth and the growth has enabled the government to help alleviate
poverty to some extent.
</P>
<P>
However, he added, "Development has also produced unintended
consequences, including numerous social and environmental problems
that have since degraded the quality of life in our society. These
problems include a widening gap in income distribution, depletion
of natural resources and deterioration of the environment, as well
as youth and social problems."
</P>
<P>
Banharn expressed his hope that the meeting "will generate new
ideas on these pressing topics to help guide national policies and
the direction of cooperation among the member countries of ESCAP
in their endeavors to alleviate rural poverty and to achieve
sustainable development."
</P>
<P>
The ministerial segment of the current 52nd ESCAP Commission
Session began today, which was preceded by a four-day senior
officials meeting from April 17 to 20, to prepare documents for
the ministerial segment.
</P>
<P>
Senior officials and ministers from 47 ESCAP members are
participating in the session, which will continue through
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
With Turkey's entry, ESCAP now has 50 full members and 10
associate members. The ESCAP region has 13 least developed
nations.

<HEADLINE> Bell Atlantic, Nynex Agree to Merge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Bell Atlantic Corp. and Nynex
Corp., two telecommunications companies of the U.S., have agreed
to merge in a deal that will create the nation's second-largest
telephone company.
</P>
<P>
The company will cover services in regions mainly in the
eastern part of the country, according to sources here.
</P>
<P>
The merger would put the two companies in a position to
confront increasing competition and enter new businesses from a
bigger customer base. It could also be the second-biggest merger
in U.S. history. Nynex's stock now is worth about 22.7 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Terms of the deal were not immediately available. An
announcement was expected either late Sunday or Monday.
</P>
<P>
The merger comes just three weeks after the first-ever
combination of regional Baby Bell companies and follows by two
months a sweeping deregulation of the telecommunications industry.
</P>
<P>
As a single phone company, Bell Atlantic and Nynex offer
businesses that operate in both of their adjacent regions one-stop
service. For example, a Boston-based company with a branch in
Pittsburgh must now deal with the two Baby Bells separately and a
third company for long-distance service.
</P>
<P>
Companies in New York City, served by Nynex, with operations
just across the Hudson River, served by Bell Atlantic, find the
current arrangement particularly inefficient.
</P>
<P>
Also, such a powerhouse allows the emerging company to better
withstand potential price competition as the communications
industry reshapes. With long-distance services like AT&AMP;T able to
enter local phone service and with cable television companies
looking to enter the phone business, a combined Bell Atlantic and
Nynex will better keep up with price discounts in its most
competitive markets, according to analysts.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the combined company will be a powerful competitor
for long-distance business in a region of the country that
accounts for a third of the nation's long-distance volume.
</P>
<P>
Consumers should expect to see little difference in local
calling rates following the merger, but could see improved service
as Bell Atlantic invests to upgrade Nynex's operations as it has
its own.
</P>
<P>
A combined Bell Atlantic and Nynex will have 38 million phone
lines in 13 states and the District of Columbia.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Plantation Workers on Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 22 (Xinhua)-- Sri Lanka's entire plantation
sector is on strike with over 500,000 workers downing tools for
seven days from today, according to official sources.
</P>
<P>
The strike, which was initially called by the Ceylon Workers
Congress, subsequently had 16 other Unions under the umbrella of
the Joint Plantation Trade Union Center joined in, the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
The strike is over three main demands: 300 days of
uninterrupted work for each worker, a daily wage hike of RS. 8 and
improvement in workers' living conditions.
</P>
<P>
According to a union spokesman, the principal objective of the
strike action was to draw attention of the government to the
grievances of the plantation sector.
</P>
<P>
These grievances include low wages, improper housing and other
basic amenities, he said.
</P>
<P>
A similar strike last year resulted in government instructing
the plantation companies to prepare a collective agreement to
ensure that the interests of the plantation workers were not
compromised.
</P>
<P>
However, there was no progress in this direction, the spokesman
added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sri Lanka's police have taken all steps to prevent
violence on estates during the strike. Police stations have been
alerted to prevent any breach of the peace and policemen have been
deployed to ensure that the 87 factories on the estates are
unharmed.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Forty-six Chinese and
overseas-funded enterprises were recognized by customhouses in
China's largest industrial city as "Enterprises with Credibility"
and will enjoy preferential treatment by customs offices.
</P>
<P>
The enterprises, all located in the Pudong New Area, were
recognized by the Shanghai Pudong Customhouse and Pudong's
Waigaoqiao Bonded Zone Customhouse for their spotless record in
management, bookkeeping, going through customs procedures, and
paying of tariffs.
</P>
<P>
The one-year customs preferential treatment they have been
granted includes priority in declaration and passage through
customs immediately. The customhouses have decided to recognize
enterprises registered with them, once a year. Those that have
been recognized can lose their rating if they fail to continue
their good reputation.
</P>
<P>
To date, 9,398 enterprises have registered with Pudong
Customs.

<HEADLINE> Waigaoqiao Trade Zone to Keep Privileges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai's Waigaoqiao Bonded
Trading Zone will keep its privileges after customs duties are
adjusted by the Chinese government, a senior customs official said
here today.
</P>
<P>
Set up in 1993, the zone was the first and is the largest of
its kind in China, with 2,350 enterprises, including 1,396
overseas-funded ones. They have a total investment of 2.99 billion
US dollars, including 1.477 billion from overseas businesses.
</P>
<P>
Starting April 1 this year, the Chinese government cancelled
the preferential customs duties for new overseas-funded
enterprises, and adjusted some policies of customs duties for the
Special Economic Zones and the Pudong New Area.
</P>
<P>
However, the official said, the preferential policies will be
maintained for the Waigaoqiao Bonded Trading Zone, which means
that enterprises in the area will continue enjoying exemption from
customs and import duties for construction materials, equipment,
fuel and spare parts that are imported for their own use.
</P>
<P>
No tariffs will be imposed for machines, equipment and other
materials for infrastructure projects in the area, he said.
</P>
<P>
The import and export policies for the area will not change
either, the official said. For example, the enterprises in the
area can engage in international trade and entrepot trade with
foreign firms and Chinese enterprises with import and export
rights; enterprises do not need to apply for quotas for imports
for self-use or the production of export goods.
</P>
<P>
The privileges granted to the area by the central government in
international trade, export-oriented processing and bondage
storage will not change, and enterprises engaged in export-oriented
processing do not have to open guarantee accounts in banks, as
is required for enterprises outside the bonded zone.

<HEADLINE> ESCAP 52nd Commission Session Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The 52nd Session of the United
Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific
(ESCAP) opened here today at the United Nations Conference Center.
</P>
<P>
The major theme for the session is "rural poverty alleviation
and sustainable development in Asia and the Pacific."
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating the session, Thai Prime Minister Banharn
Silpa-archa said that despite the successes in the region,
development has also produced unintended consequences, including
numerous social and environmental problems, a widening gap in
income distribution, depletion of natural resources and
deterioration of the environment, as well as youth and social
problems.
</P>
<P>
The Thai prime minister expressed his hope that the meeting
"will generate new ideas on these pressing topics to help guide
national policies and the direction of cooperation among the
member countries of ESCAP in their endeavors to alleviate rural
poverty and to achieve sustainable development."
</P>
<P>
A Chinese government delegation, led by Vice Foreign Minister
Li Zhaoxing, is attending the session.
</P>
<P>
Adrianus Mooy, under-secretary-general of the United Nations
and executive secretary of ESCAP, read out a message from
Secretary-General of the United Nations Boutros Boutros-Ghali,
which said, "The United Nations has been active in such diverse
fields as eradication of hunger and disease, development of
physical infrastructure, strengthening of statistical
capabilities, protection of the environment with a view to
accelerating economic growth, and enhancing the prospects for
regional economic cooperation."
</P>
<P>
he added, "The Asia-Pacific region is now placed squarely at
the forefront of world economic growth. Yet, given the diversity
in the development experience within the region, the challenges
ahead will be many."
</P>
<P>
The current ESCAP session includes two segments -- the senior
officials segment and the ministerial segment. The senior
officials segment was held from April 17 to 20 to prepare for the
ministerial part of the session.
</P>
<P>
With Turkey becoming the newest member, ESCAP now has 50 full
members and 10 associate members. Among them are 13 least
developed nations.
</P>
<P>
Officials at the ministerial level from 42 members and 5
associate members are participating in the session, which will
continue through Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Italians Go to Polls to Elect New Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Italians went to polling booths on
Sunday to elect the 13th post-war parliament, hoping the elections
could end the country's unstable political situation.
</P>
<P>
Many voters rushed to the polling booths early in the morning.
</P>
<P>
At 7 a.m. (0500 GMT) when the polling began, the first voters,
Maria Vita and her husband, appeared at No. 320 polling station of
the Paliori Region in Rome.
</P>
<P>
Vita said she has voted in all the post-war elections.
</P>
<P>
"It's not important who win in the elections, but it's crucial
that the winners should honor their promises made during the
election campaign," she said.
</P>
<P>
Vita, a nonparty personage, is quite disappointed that nearly
all the winners ignored what they had promised after they came
into power.
</P>
<P>
Her husband, standing by, made a cross in front of his chest
and said, "Thank God. I hope things will change this time...."
</P>
<P>
By 8:30 a.m., many people stood at the gate of No. 320 polling
station, waiting to cast their ballots. Some voters seemed
undecided yet.
</P>
<P>
Italy set up a total of 91,457 polling stations this time and,
according to official figures, among the present population in
Italy of 56.78 million, eligible voters are about 48.91 million.
</P>
<P>
Up for the election were all 630 seats in the Chamber of
Deputies and all 315 in the Senate. Final results were not
expected until at least Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
Media tycoon Silvio Berlusconi's center-right Freedom Alliance
and Romano Prodi's center-left Olive Tree bloc are running in the
elections.
</P>
<P>
The Olive Tree alliance, as is called the center-left, consists
of the hardline Communist Refoundation, the Left Party and a small
collection of former Christian Democrats. It also includes current
acting Prime Minister Lamberto Dini.
</P>
<P>
Berlusconi was fighting to overcome corruption charges to
return to the prime minister's office he held for eight months in
1994.
</P>
<P>
His coalition is made up of his Forza Italy (Let's Go Italy)
party, the National Alliance, descended from Italy's neo-fascist
movement, and a handful of conservative-leaning former Christian
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
Italy, now seeking to form its 55th post-war government,
enjoyed a degree of stability through the Cold War years until
1992 under a proportional voting system which delivered a string
of revolving-door governments largely made up of the same faces.
</P>
<P>
That ended dramatically when crusading prosecutors uncovered
massive corruption, unleashing a political earthquake that buried
the long-governing Christian Democrats and their allies.
</P>
<P>
The parties and politicians that replaced them have failed to
create a stable government in a political landscape more confusing
and fractured than ever.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong Farmers Grasping Prosperity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, April 22 (Xinhua) -- A survey of the rural areas of
south China's Guangdong Province shows that farmers there are
closing the gap with city dwellers as far as their standard of
living is concerned.
</P>
<P>
The farmers' spending on non-staple food accounted for nearly
56 percent of the total they spent on food last year, up from 50.4
percent in 1990.
</P>
<P>
And 75 percent of non-staple food in the province was purchased
by farmers last year, compared with 70.6 percent in 1990.
</P>
<P>
More than 66 percent of their expenditure on clothes went on
ready-to-wear garments in 1995, most of which were of high quality
and fashionable.
</P>
<P>
The average per-capita living space for peasants was 20.8 sq m
last year, and more than 41 percent of houses were built of
reinforced concrete, rising from 15.1 percent in 1990.
</P>
<P>
There are now an average of more than 34 color TV sets, 49
cassette recorders, two video recorders, 16 motorcycles, nearly 15
washing machines, and eight refrigerators for every 100 peasant
households.

<P>
ZAGREB, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Serbs clashed with Muslim
and Croat refugees who tried to visit their homes in the northern
town of Doboj on Sunday, local reports said.
</P>
<P>
Injuries on both sides were reported following the melee which
happened when angry Serbs blocked the way of the refugees. IFOR
troops escorting the refugees had to fire in the air to stop the
confrontation.
</P>
<P>
The incident involved more than one hundred people, the reports
said.
</P>
<P>
Also on Sunday, Bosnian Croat refugees were prevented from
visiting a Catholic cemetery in another Serb-controlled town of
Bosanski Brod.
</P>
<P>
Local Serbs shouted curses at the Croats and threw stones at
the buses they were aboard, smashing all the windows. The Croats
were forced to abandon the trip.
</P>
<P>
Although the Bosnian peace accord calls for respect of the
rights of the refugees, these principles can hardly be implemented
because of harassments of visitors which have occurred recently in
both Serbs-controlled regions and Muslim-Croat federation.

<HEADLINE> China Improves Tumen Area Investment Conditions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China's Jilin
Province is further improving the investment conditions in the
Tumen River delta to pave the way for international co-operation.
</P>
<P>
The Tumen River delta, an area bordering China, the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and Russia, is being encouraged
by the UN Development Program to develop into a transportation,
industrial, commercial and banking center.
</P>
<P>
At a conference on the Northeast Asian region's economy held in
Japan, the investment environment of Hunchun in Jilin's Yanbian
Korean Autonomous Prefecture, on the Tumen River delta, was
regarded as ideal.
</P>
<P>
The city, with a population of 100,000, now has buildings with
a combined floor space of more than two million sq m. They are
supplied with abundant water and power supply facilities.
</P>
<P>
Gone are the days when people in Hunchun took two to three days
to make a telephone call to the neighboring area in Russia via
Beijing and Moscow, and they had to employ the traditional way of
hoisting flags to make emergency contact.
</P>
<P>
An international telephone service now links Hunchun with
Russia, and an optic-fiber cable from Hunchun to Chongjin in the
DPRK is scheduled to go into operation this year.
</P>
<P>
At present, the telephone availability rate in the Yanbian
Korean Autonomous Prefecture, which includes Hunchun and borders
on Russia and the DPRK, is eight percent, double the national
average, and that of Yanji, the prefectural capital, 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Yanji Airport handled 300,000 passengers last year, up from
10,000 in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Jilin imported and exported 20,000 tons of cargo via the
Hunchun Port last year.
</P>
<P>
A local official said that the daily-improving investment
conditions in the Tumen River delta have attracted many of
transnational corporations.
</P>
<P>
The largest textile industrial group in the Republic of Korea
(ROK) has set up four textile mills in Hunchun, and the ROK's
Hyundai Group is building a steel tube plant with an investment of
20 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The official noted that Hunchun is expected to generate an
industrial output value totalling two billion yuan in 1998, nearly
ten times the present figure.
</P>
<P>
Yanji has also become a favorite place for investment from the
United States, ROK and Japan.
</P>
<P>
The central government has listed the development of the Tumen
River delta as one of its state capital construction projects.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Bourse Prepares to Resume Bond Futures Trading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai Stock Exchange
(SSE) is speeding up the re-designing of systems and regulations
in preparation for the resumption of bond futures trading, the
Shanghai-based "Wenhui Bao" reported today.
</P>
<P>
China suspended bond futures trading in May last year because
of rampant speculation.
</P>
<P>
The exchange is expected to take a series of steps to "lay a
firm foundation for future expansion", said Yang Xianghai,
president of the exchange, at a conference attended by
representatives of all companies listed.
</P>
<P>
SSE will offer more services for the Ministry of Finance in
issuing treasury bonds and handle a larger proportion of tradable
bonds in a bid to boost the treasury bond trade. Not all of
China's treasury bonds are tradable.
</P>
<P>
To consolidate Shanghai's position as the bond repurchase
center, the bourse will improve management in line with possible
changes in the repurchase market after the central bank launched
the open market operation .
</P>
<P>
Companies with large investments, good performance records, and
promising growth will be encouraged to list B shares, restricted
to overseas investors, on the exchange, which has plans to upgrade
clearance and settlement systems, reduce service fees, add market
transparency and widen channels in releasing information.
</P>
<P>
To spur trade in B shares, the bourse will create more active
instruments deriving from the B shares, welcome Chinese companies
listed on overseas exchanges to re-list their shares on its board,
and attract giant foreign companies to raise funds on its floor.
</P>
<P>
Companies issuing A shares, targeted at domestic investors,
will have such new trade products as convertible bonds and
warranties to raise funds.
</P>
<P>
The exchange has also promised to list three newly-established
funds as soon as possible. Officials with the exchange said that
they will actively promote the experiments in Sino-foreign
cooperative funds and other funds and introduce social security
funds into the market as part of the efforts to buttress the
influence of institutional investors.
</P>
<P>
During a recent tour of the exchange, Li Jian'ge, vice-chairman
of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, said "Securities
should develop steadily, and the pace should be speeded up
properly."

DHAKA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- A forest fire in the south of
Bangladesh sunderbans, which originated on Friday and spread over
an area of about 300 acres, ravaged a large portion of the world's
largest mangrove forest, said the reports reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
Local forest officials complained that efforts to tame the
devastating fire proved futile for lack of water and adequate
firefighters.

<P>
Officials said the cause of the blaze, the first on such a
large scale in the sunderbans, could not be ascertained
immediately but an investigation team had been formed to probe the
incident.
</P>
<P>
They suspected that the current hot spell might be the cause of
the fire in the sunderbans, the home of the royal Bengal tigers
and numerous flora and fauna as well as the valuable sundari and

<HEADLINE> India's BJP May Emerge Single Largest Party: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 22 (Xinhua) -- India's major opposition
Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) may emerge the single largest party
with the ruling Congress Party coming second in the coming general
elections, according to a survey conducted by the Week Magazine.
</P>
<P>
The pre-election seat prediction poll, released by the Times of
India today, says the BJP may fall short of a majority by 65 to 80
seats in the next Lok Sabha (lower house of parliament).
</P>
<P>
Based on the swing factor for different regions and states in
the country, the survey has concluded that the BJP would win 190
to 215 seats, the Congress Party 145 to 170 and the National
Front-Left Parties Combine 100 to 115. The All India Indira
Congress and a whole phalanx of regional parties would win 60 to
80 seats.
</P>
<P>
The total tally is for 537 Lok Sabha seats, excluding six seats
in Indian-held Jammu and Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
So far as the personalities are concerned, the survey says
incumbent Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao is the "best suited"
prime minister, with Atal Behari Vajpayee from the BJP trailing
behind him.
</P>
<P>
The survey, to appear in the next issue of the Week Magazine,
says that the Congress party would not be able to hold on to the
dominant position despite being rated as the better party to
tackle issues like price hikes, unemployment, corruption and
communal harmony.

<HEADLINE> Water Level Sinks Fast in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Ground water level in most parts of
Bangladesh is depleting rapidly, causing severe threat to crop
production and climatic systems, water experts have warned.
</P>
<P>
Mizanur Rahman, director of ground water circle of the Water
Development Board (WDB), contributed the decrease of the ground
water level to the gradual increase in its daily use in
Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
He said that even in the monsoon season, when the ground water
level was supposed to be recharged in natural process, no change
was reflected in the ground water chart, particularly in Dhaka
city and other major urban areas.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, reports from 16 northern districts said that
peasants were facing a sever crisis of water in the dry season
from November to April. In some areas the fall of the level has
been recorded at 70 feet, while the small rivers of the region
have dried up.
</P>
<P>
Mizanur Rahman warned that if the situation continues, the
water crisis would lead the country towards desertification and
the moisture of the atmosphere would also decline.
</P>
<P>
In Bangladesh, the water supply system in urban areas and
irrigation system in rural areas are mostly dependent on ground
water.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 22 (Xinhua) -- African countries are exploring
and gradually improving their political systems both in
conformity with their historic and cultural traditions and in the
interest of maintaining their stability and national unity.
</P>
<P>
All these efforts are made to create a peaceful and stable
political environment favorable for economic development.
</P>
<P>
African countries also insist on settling regional conflicts
by means of consultation. For this the Organization of African
Unity (OAU) and some sub-regional institutions in the continent
have played an outstanding role.
</P>
<P>
African countries have practised economic reforms, exploited
natural and human resources, improved investment environment and
drawn up various liberal regulations to attract capital, expand
markets abroad, and diversify their exports.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, they have gained results in enhancing
economic cooperation for regional integration against the
challenge of the intensified regionalization in the world
economic arena.
</P>
<P>
However, there are still grave challenges facing them although
they have gotten over the most difficult time in exploring their
own ways to stability and development.
</P>
<P>
Civil conflicts and fightings in some African countries have
not yet settled down finally. Tribal, religious and regional
contradictions inherent in a number of countries need time to be
wiped out.
</P>
<P>
And heavy Burden of foreign debts make African countries
unable to shake off dependence on the outside world. Their
farming still depends on the vagaries of the weather and fast
growth of the population has gravely hindered their economy's
healthy development.
</P>
<P>
What's more, political and economic pressures from the west on
African countries remain.
</P>
<P>
Africa needs the world, and vice versa. There are 53
independent countries in Africa, accounting for about half of the
non-aligned nations and some one third of the U.N. member states.
The African countries are an important force indispensable for
the maintenance of world peace and stability and for realization
of global economic and social development.
</P>
<P>
We are sure that as long as they advance by relying on their
own efforts and cooperate with other countries in the world,
African countries are bound to overcome their difficulty and
realize their dream of revitalization and development in the
continent.

<HEADLINE> Death Toll in Delhi Blast Rises to 17 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 22 (Xinhua) -- The death toll in Saturday's
explosion in a guest house here has risen to 17 as police
continued to be mystified by the cause of the blast, the Time of
India reported today.
</P>
<P>
Nine more bodies were recovered on Sunday from the site of the
blast which instantly killed eight people and injured 29.
</P>
<P>
The blast reduced the four-storied guest house, located just
half a kilometer from the New Delhi railway station, to debris.
</P>
<P>
Eight of the dead were foreign nationals: two Nigerians, one
from Holland and a European woman, who is yet to be identified.
Three Kashmiris, lodged in the guest house, were also among the
dead.
</P>
<P>
Of the 29 injured, 24 had been discharged from local hospitals.
 Five people, including four Kashmiris, were still undergoing
treatment at a local hospital.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, it remains unknown what caused the
explosion. Experts summoned from India's Intelligence Bureau, the
national security guards, the central science forensic laboratory
and the army are yet to arrive at a conclusion.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, two hitherto unknown terrorist outfits --
Harkat-Ul-Momineen of Kashmir and the Khalistan Liberation Forum
-- have claimed responsibility for the blast. The security
agencies, however, were not informed of these claims.
</P>
<P>
Rescue work at the blast site was in progress till late Sunday
afternoon. Experts combing the area believed that a sack-full of
explosives might have been planted in the ground floor of the
building for an explosion of this intensity.
</P>
<P>
Police were questioning residents in the area to find out if
they saw a large container being brought inside the guest house.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Development In Africa Not Dream (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 22 (Xinhua) -- "The dream of development of
Africa is not unreal. Africa can and will develop," and Africa is
on the road to development.
</P>
<P>
This was declared to the world by Salim Ahmed Salim,
Secretary-General of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) in
his 1996 New Year message.
</P>
<P>
Mr Salim is optimistic because the pounding at Africa by the
big changes in the world situation has eased and the turmoils in
some parts of the continent are getting quieter; the political
situation in Africa is heading for tranquillity and stability;
countries are getting united for development; and the economies
in a number of African states are recovering or revitalizing.
</P>
<P>
The economic growth rate in the continent increased from 0.4
percent in 1993 to 2.9 percent in 1995, according to the latest
statistics from the African Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
As for the 33 least developed countries in Africa listed by
the United Nations, the annual growth rate increased from the
average 0.3 percent in 1990-94 to 2.2 percent in 1995, according
to a report made public in early April by the United Nations
Conference of Trade and Development.
</P>
<P>
This shows that the economy in Africa is coming out of the
lowest stage and that most countries are moving onto a road of
sounder development.
</P>
<P>
The 1960s and 1970s saw Africa's upsurge in both political and
economic fields. However, since entering the 1980s, Africa has
fallen behind economically.
</P>
<P>
After the cold war, western countries exploited their serious
difficulty to peddle and impose "multiparty democracy" onto
African countries. This intensified the inherent political,
economic, tribal and religious contradictions there, leading to
turmoil in many African countries.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the impacts of the old and unreasonable world
economic order and grave natural disasters were also vital
factors that caused the African economy to deteriorate seriously.
</P>
<P>
All this made African politicians worried. They began to think
hard and explore ways for political and economic revitalization
in the continent, reaching the conclusion: for a promising future
in Africa, it is imperative to strive to become stronger by
self-reliance and cooperation, maintain political and social
stability, and promote economic development through reforms.

<HEADLINE> Guangxi to Expand Fangcheng Port </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Fangcheng, the largest port in
south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, will be greatly
expanded in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
Local officials said that eight deep-water berths will be built
before the turn of the century, bringing the total number of such
berths to 16.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000 the annual handling capacity of the port will
be raised from the present eight million tons to 20 million tons,
making it the most important outlet to the sea for southwest China.
</P>
<P>
Experts estimate that the expansion program will cost 2.4
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Of the eight planned berths, one is expected to be put into use
within the year and work on two others is expected to be kicked
off in the first half of the year, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
To expand the usable land area of the port, the authorities
will move the downtown center further north and reclaim more than
660 ha of sea area.
</P>
<P>
The port now has a land area of 14.7 sq km.
</P>
<P>
The reclamation work has been contracted by eight firms from
Beijing, Hong Kong, Guangdong and Hainan, according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
The city center will be moved to Shatanjiang, about 10 km north
of the port, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Mao Xuhui, the city's mayor, said that by 1998 at the latest
the government departments will be moved into the new city, which
will occupy an area of 50 sq km by the year 2000, with the
population in the downtown area rising from the present 90,000 to
200,000.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the relocation of the city and the
reclamation work will cost a total of four billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government will rent part of the new downtown
city and 50 percent of the reclaimed land to businesses as returns
to the developers.

<HEADLINE> China Steps up Exploitation of Natural Gas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 22 (Xinhua) -- China aims to double its gas
production capacity to 30 billion cu m by the year 2005, as one of
the state's important strategies for developing energy resources.
</P>
<P>
According to experts with the China National Petroleum
Corporation (CNPC), China is expected to verify additional onshore
gas reserves of one trillion cu m by the end of the century, with
the accumulative total hitting two trillion cu m.
</P>
<P>
By then, the country's gas production capacity will be
increased by another 10 billion cu m, with the accumulative total
topping 25 billion cu m.
</P>
<P>
The CNPC source said that through further exploration major
breakthroughs are forecast in the expansion of proven gas reserves
and production capacity in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia region, the
Tarim Basin and Sichuan Province. And the annual gas output will
reach 30 billion cu m by the year 2005.
</P>
<P>
The CNPC officials noted that a huge potential exists for the
country's gas production. Through years of vigorous development
three large-scale gas production areas have taken shape in the
country.
</P>
<P>
In the central part of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia region total
gas reserves of 230 billion cu m have been verified. Total gas
reserves of 200 billion cu m have been proven in the eastern part
of Sichuan. In the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region total gas
reserves of 160 billion cu m have been verified, in addition to
the discovery of a group of new gas-bearing structures.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, in the Sebei area of northwest China's Qinghai
Province, a large gas field with proven reserves of 50 billion cu
m has been found.
</P>
<P>
Alongside the domestic gas exploration, active efforts are
being made to utilize gas resources of neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
In Central Asia, China has joined an international gas
exploration project which envisages the construction of a
long-distance gas pipeline running through China and the Korean
Peninsula to Japan, and will provide China with a gas supply of 25
billion cu m a year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a joint venture with Russia for gas exploration in
eastern Siberia will pipe to China 25 billion cu m of gas a year.

<HEADLINE> Zhejiang to Invest More in Key Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, April 22 (Xinhua) -- East China's Zhejiang Province
plans to spend over 200 billion yuan on the construction of 100
major projects in the Ninth Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000), a
provincial official said here today.
</P>
<P>
The projects cover agriculture and its related sectors,
communications, posts and telecommunications, power and raw
materials. The amount of investment represents a sevenfold
increase over that of the previous five years, he said.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of the 1990s Zhejiang has intensified
macro-economic control on fixed assets investment and diverted
more funds to infrastructural facilities and basic industries.
</P>
<P>
The effort has increased the province's power generating
capacity by four million kw and port handling capacity by 20
million tons a year. About 430 km of new railway lines and double
tracking as well as 4,375 km of highways have also been built.
</P>
<P>
The major construction projects to be built in the coming five
years include 19 major grain and cotton production bases and the
third-phase expansion of Beilun Port in Ningbo City, a railway
line from Jinhua to Wenzhou and expressways from Shanghai to
Hangzhou, from Hangzhou to Nanjing and from Ningbo to Wenzhou.
</P>
<P>
In the next five years the province will also build power
plants with a total generating capacity of eight million kw and a
number of petrochemical and raw material projects, the official
said.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang will spend 12 billion yuan on the construction of 53
key construction projects this year, 16 of which are already under
way, he said.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Gives Priority to Livestock Breeding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, April 22 (Xinhua) -- High priority is being given to
livestock breeding and fisheries for the development of Myanmar's
agro-based economy.
</P>
<P>
Plans are under way for rural development by setting up model
livestock breeding villages and townships throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar Ministry of Livestock Breeding and Fisheries has
launched a project to breed local strains on a manageable scale as
the initial step and to breed quality strains on a commercial
scale as the next step.
</P>
<P>
For the progress of the sector, the Myanmar government is also
rendering assistance in building trawlers for entrepreneurs and
already opened in February this year the Myanmar Livestock
Breeding and Fisheries Development Bank granting loans to
entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has enough land for livestock breeding and fish
resources and rivers.
</P>
<P>
Annual growth rate of the sector was 3 percent in 1993-94 and
4.6 percent in 1994-95. That for 1995-96, which ended on March 31,
is yet to be announced.
</P>
<P>
However, Myanmar has set the sector's average annual growth
rate at 5.8 percent in the next five-year plan (1996-97 to
2000-2001) beginning April 1.
</P>
<P>
Since moving towards an open market-oriented economic system,
Myanmar also induced foreign investment in the livestock breeding
and fisheries sector which had amounted to 252 million US dollars
in 15 projects by the end of March, according to the official
statistics.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, joint ventures on fisheries set up with foreign
countries included Myanmar-Beijing with China, Myanmar-Onk and
Myanmar-Narong with Thailand and Myanmar-Sanwa with Japan.

<HEADLINE> Rare Monkey Found in Fujian Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 22 (Xinhua) -- A rare tiny monkey, thought to
have been long extinct, has been found by a group of archeologists
in the Wuyi Mountains of east China's Fujian Province, according
to the overseas edition of the "People's Daily".
</P>
<P>
The animal weighs only 200 grams and is the size of a mouse,
but possesses all the features of a monkey and high intelligence.
</P>
<P>
Such monkeys were kept as pets in ancient China by men of
letters, including the Song Dynasty philosopher Zhu Xi
(1130-1200), and were thus given the name of Ink Monkey or Pen
Monkey.
</P>
<P>
They were trained to prepare ink, pass writing brushes and turn
pages, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
They were fed on peanuts or soybeans, and slept in brush pots
or drawers.

<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, April 22 (Xinhua) -- North China's Hebei Province
is accelerating the construction of ports of entry to streamline
its growing foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
The province had only one port of entry -- the Qinhuangdao sea
